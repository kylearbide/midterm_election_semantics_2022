House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
March 3, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable JOHN A. 
YARMUTH to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally

STILL I RISE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, proud to be an Amer-
ican, proud to be a Member of the U.S. 
House of Representatives. 
I rise today because I refuse to accept 
the notion that we should get back to 
bigotry as usual in the House of Rep-
resentatives. I am one who has fought 
bigotry most of my life, and I will con-
tinue to fight it for the rest of my life. 
Today, I want to talk about bigotry, 
not only within the country, but I also 
want to talk about those who aid and 
abet bigotry in the House of Represent-
atives. Right here in this House there 
are people who aid and abet bigotry. 
I spoke last on the floor about a 
Newsday report. It concerned an inves-
tigation that took place in the State of 
New York. And within this investiga-
tion it was uncovered that, with ref-
erence to real estate agents, after hav-
ing tested them, it was uncovered that 
19 percent of the time Asian Americans 
were treated unequally when compared 
to White Americans. Thirty-nine per-
cent of the time Hispanic Americans 
were treated unequally. And 49 percent 
of the time African Americans were 
treated unequally. 
We sought to do something about 
this in the Financial Services Com-
mittee. We have a piece of legislation 
that will provide for testing and ex-
pand the testing that was started in 
this 
country 
by 
President 
Ronald 
Reagan. 
President Reagan gave us the para-
digm which we seek to enhance, which 
we seek to expand because that is the 
means by which we can eliminate this 
kind of invidious discrimination. It is 
not a question of way; it is a question 
of whether we have the will to chal-
lenge it and take it on. 
I want to tell you that in my com-
mittee there were those who would aid 
and abet. They came up with specious 
arguments, fallacious contentions, the 
notion that we can do without, without 
saying we can do without the improve-
ments. 
I believe this kind of aiding and abet-
ting is the reason we still have this 
level of invidious discrimination in 
this country. There are people in this 
Congress who aid and abet racism and 
discrimination. We have to call this 
out. We cannot continue to pretend 
that it does not exist right here in the 
Congress of the United States of Amer-
ica. 
I plan to come back to this podium, 
and I am going to say more about what 
happened and who caused it to happen. 
Those who tolerate bigotry and racism 
perpetuate bigotry and racism. I refuse 
to be among those who tolerate it. 
f 
IMPROVING SECURITY ON SCHOOL 
GROUNDS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, every par-
ent’s worst nightmare is to learn that 
their children’s school may be one of 
the sites of mass violence. Schools 
should not be a place where our kids 
have to fear, it should be where they 
learn, and grow, and follow their 
dreams. 
No child should have to be more con-
cerned about their safety than they are 
about their science project, band con-
cert, or basketball game. 
That is why last year, I and many 
others introduced the Securing Our 
Schools Act in the last Congress, 
passed it on to the President, and it 
was signed into law. 
I was proud that our bipartisan bill 
passed the House and Senate and was 
signed into law by the President. The 
new law creates a Federal grant pro-
gram for local communities to improve 
security in their schools. 
School districts and law enforcement 
can use these critical funds to purchase 
life-saving technology, panic alert sys-
tems, 
communications 
equipment, 
cameras, door locks, or to better train 
authorities when incidents of violence 
might occur. 
Last year, $33 million in grants were 
allocated to 103 school districts nation-
wide, making four million students 
safer. The application process is now 
open for grants for the 2021 fiscal year. 
Please urge local officials, those in 
your district to visit cops.doj.gov for 
more information on how to apply for 
up to $500,000 in grants through the 
School Violence Prevention Program. 
Once again, that is cops.doj.gov.

H1442 
March 3, 2020 
The application deadline for this fis-
cal year is April 8. Please reach out to 
your community, community leaders, 
law enforcement, and local school dis-
tricts. 
We have advanced safety technology 
in banks, office buildings, and retail lo-
cations. 
There 
is 
no 
reason 
we 
shouldn’t have this technology at all of 
our schools to protect all of our chil-

f 
RECOGNIZING INTERNATIONAL 
WOMEN’S DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of International 
Women’s Day on March 8 to call atten-
tion to women around the world who 
have risked their personal safety and 
freedom to speak out for the rights of 
all women. 
I am particularly inspired by the ex-
ample of three brave Saudi women who 
have spent nearly 2 years imprisoned 
or under house arrest because of their 
fearless advocacy. 
These three women, Loujain Al- 
Hathloul, Nouf Abdulaziz, and Eman 
Al-Nafjan, are outstanding examples of 
the many Saudi activists who bravely 
fought to stop Saudi Arabia’s male 
guardianship, fought to end its prohibi-
tion on women driving, and fought to 
open up female participation in elec-
tions and public office. 
And although the government osten-
sibly granted such freedoms in 2018, 
these three women continue to face dif-
ferent injustices, including torture or 
threats of murder and sexual violence 
and limited access to family or legal 
representation. 
Loujain has been particularly tar-
geted for her courageous leadership 
within this women’s movement. Her 
selfless commitment has paved the way 
for crucial social reforms, but unfortu-
nately, the Saudi Government has at-
tempted to undermine her contribu-
tions with politically-motivated crimi-
nal charges, a lengthy imprisonment, 
and inhumane abuse. 
This incredible woman deserves to be 
honored, not jailed, which is why I re-
cently led several colleagues in nomi-
nating Loujain for the Nobel Peace 
Prize and will continue to advocate for 
her through the Tom Lantos Human 
Rights Commission’s Defending Free-
doms Project. 
This 
Congress, 
we 
have 
already 
adopted a bipartisan resolution in the 
House to urge for the release of these 
women and other activists. Today, we 
call on Saudi Arabia once again to free 
these women and to lift the threat of 
their continued persecution. 
To maintain our international lead-
ership, the United States has a moral 
obligation to uphold democratic prin-
ciples. The President, the Secretary of 
State, and the entire Trump adminis-
tration must increase its diplomatic 
pressure to demand the release of these 
women and hold the Saudi Government 
accountable for its appalling disregard 
of human rights. 
As we recognize this International 
Women’s Day, we are reminded to look 
beyond our borders; to continue to 
bring attention to the urgent and ongo-
ing human rights violations that the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is commit-
ting. 
I ask that all women and their allies 
throughout the United States and 
around the world and all men join me 
in standing with these amazing Saudi 
feminists in demanding that they be 
freed. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
NUTRITION MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
March as National Nutrition Month. 
A well-balanced, nutritious diet is 
important for all Americans, and ac-
cess to fresh, quality ingredients and 
food shouldn’t be a luxury. 
Last Congress, I had the honor of 
serving as the chairman of the Agri-
culture Subcommittee on Nutrition, 
Oversight, and Department Operations. 
During my time as chairman, and 
through all of my years on the House 
Agriculture Committee, I have met 
with many advocates, stakeholders, 
and other individuals who understand 
the role that nutrition plays in the 
lives of all Americans at every stage of 
life. 
Nutrition plays a particularly impor-
tant role in the lives of our Nation’s 
children, however. During critical de-
velopment years, children are particu-
larly dependent on foods that are 
packed with nutrients. In some unfor-
tunate cases, the meals that students 
receive at school may be the only time 
they eat during the day. 
It is important that we do what we 
can to ensure schools have the re-
sources that they need to provide stu-
dents with delicious and nutritious op-
tions. 
In January, the USDA announced 
two new proposals to expand nutri-
tional options for our Nation’s school 
children. The new rules allow schools 
to offer a greater variety of vegetables, 
options to customize school breakfasts, 
and the ability to purchase items a la 
carte. 
This added flexibility will not only 
bolster the consumption of nutritious 
food in our schools, it will also help re-
duce food waste. 
At the end of the day, it doesn’t mat-
ter how nutritious school lunches are, 
if students aren’t eating them, they are 
not nutritious. I am hopeful that this 
recent change will encourage more of 
our Nation’s young people to make in-
creasingly healthy, well-rounded food 
choices. 
In addition to a greater variety of 
fruits and vegetables, we can help re-
store 
nutritious 
dairy 
options 
in 
schools. My bill, the Whole Milk for 
Healthy Kids Act, would allow both fla-
vored and nonflavored milk back into 
our Nation’s school cafeterias. Addi-
tionally, the School Milk Nutrition 
Act would further expand milk options 
for students and help reverse the de-
cline of milk consumption in schools. 
While we can all be advocates for 
healthy diets and good nutrition, I 
would like to specifically recognize the 
registered dietitian nutritionists who 
are one of our most valuable resources 
in the pursuit of reliable food and nu-
trition information. 
Next week, on March 11, we celebrate 
Registered Dietitian Nutritionist Day 
and thank these individuals for their 
role in building strong, healthy fami-
lies and communities. 
f 
PARTICIPATION IN THE 2020 
CENSUS IS IMPORTANT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight 
the importance of participation in the 
upcoming 2020 Census, and specifically 
the critical importance of getting a 
full count of Tribal Nation citizens. 
Census results affect our commu-
nities every day. As the official count 
of how many people live in our commu-
nities, the Census determines every-
thing from plans for highways, to fund-
ing for special education, and support 
for our firefighters. 
The results of the 2020 Census will 
help determine how hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars in Federal funding flow 
into communities every year for the 
next decade. 
Think of our local schools: Census 
counts help determine how money is 
allocated for Head Start early edu-
cation programs and for grants that 
support college access and education 
programs for children with disabilities. 
But that is not all. The Census deter-
mines Federal funding for SoonerCare, 
foster care programs, housing assist-
ance, infrastructure investments, and 
so much more. We have to make sure 
that every Oklahoman is counted so 
that our communities receive the sup-
port they need. 
This past week, I was proud to intro-
duce bipartisan legislation encouraging 
Federal, State, local governments, and 
Tribal Nations to work together as 
partners to encourage participation in 
the 2020 Census among American Indi-
ans and Alaskan natives. 
Today, Oklahoma is home to 39 
Tribes. The Census ensures we make a 
strong investment in Oklahoma and 
provide resources to Tribal Nations 
that fulfill the Federal-Indian trust re-
sponsibility. 
Funding 
for 
critical 
healthcare programs, housing initia-
tives, and education is at stake. 
For too long, Tribal Nations have 
been shortchanged in Federal funding

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1443 
March 3, 2020 
due to a Census that has historically 
undercounted Native American popu-
lations. 
b 1015 
In the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau 
estimates that American Indians and 
Alaska Natives were undercounted by 
approximately 4.9 percent, more than 
double the undercount rate of the next 
closest population group. 
The negative consequences of under-
counting cannot be quickly corrected. 
The Census occurs only once every 10 
years, and as a result, undercounting 
Tribal nations can significantly reduce 
Federal funding levels for important 
programs for an entire decade. 
Over 300 Federal programs rely on 
data derived from the Census, and Trib-
al nations rely on many of them. They 
include Native American schools and 
education programs; Native American 
workforce programs; Tribal health pro-
grams; Tribal housing programs; water 
and sewage projects; and transit, infra-
structure, and economic development 
programs. 
We must ensure Native voices are 
heard and counted. The Census is an 
opportunity, not a threat. 
Responses to the 2020 Census are con-
fidential, protected by law. Personal 
information is never shared by the Cen-
sus Bureau with any other government 
agencies or law enforcement, and re-
sponses cannot be used against individ-
uals by government agencies or in 
court in any way. 
All households will receive official 
Census mail by April 1, and individuals 
and families can respond online, by 
mail, by phone, or in person. 
It is critically important that all 
Oklahomans participate in this Census. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
from the Native American Caucus, in-
cluding co-chairs Congressman TOM 
COLE
from Oklahoma and Congress-
woman DEB HAALAND from New Mex-
ico, who have helped to highlight the 
importance of getting a full Census 
count among Tribal nations. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
and communities to work together as 
partners with Tribal nations to encour-
age participation in the 2020 Census 
and to inform the public that the 2020 
Census is safe, easy, and important. 
f 
FRACKING BAN WOULD LEAD TO 
SOCIALISM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, one of 
the most absurd and destructive plans 
being touted by out-of-touch socialists 
is a ban on fracking, also known as hy-
draulic fracturing, for natural gas and 
oil. 
At home in Pennsylvania’s 12th Con-
gressional District, a region that on 
any given day produces up to 10 per-
cent of our Nation’s natural gas, it is 
easy to see how the energy economy 
has benefited everyone. From high-pay-
ing jobs to lower energy costs, natural 
gas has been an economic win for the 
American people. 
Even more, thanks to the natural gas 
boom, America is now energy inde-
pendent. That means great things for 
our national security, as we are no 
longer beholden to energy-producing 
nations that hate us. 
Unbelievably, these great benefits 
are under attack by radical socialists 
who seek to ban fracking and cripple 
America’s energy economy. 
According to the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, the plan to end fracking 
would cost more than 600,000 jobs and 
$261 billion in GDP by 2025, and that is 
just in Pennsylvania. 
This is why I invited the socialists in 
this Congress and those running for 
President who want to ban fracking to 
come to Pennsylvania’s 12th Congres-
sional District to face the families they 
wish to leave destitute, to face the 
families who have finally found suc-
cess, and tell them why they want to 
take it away. 
For these folks, a ban on fracking 
would lead to more government de-
pendence, lower wages, fewer jobs, and 
skyrocketing energy prices. 
In other words, banning fracking 
would pave the road for America to be-
come a socialist country. There should 
be nothing scarier or more sickening 
than that. 
CONGRATULATING BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
take a little bit of time today to con-
gratulate 
Bucknell 
University 
on 
achieving a great recognition this 
week. 
According to the United States Peace 
Corps, Bucknell University, located in 
Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, produces the 
fourth most Peace Corps volunteers of 
all small colleges and universities na-
tionwide. 
In their 2020 report, the Peace Corps 
noted Bucknell produced 13 volunteers 
for the Peace Corps, an amazing feat 
for an institution whose student body 
is just over 3,600 students. 
According to its mission statement, 
‘‘Bucknell educates students for a life-
time of critical thinking and strong 
leadership characterized by continued 
intellectual 
exploration, 
creativity, 
and imagination.’’ 
By forming students in that mission, 
it is no wonder why so many Bucknell 
students find themselves seeking great-
er service to humanity through the 
Peace Corps. 
In noting the type of schools that 
make up the list of robust Peace Corps 
volunteers, Peace Corps Director Jody 
Olsen said: ‘‘These schools are institu-
tions that emphasize . . . service-mind-
ed students.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people 
of Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional 
District, I congratulate Bucknell Uni-
versity and President Bravman on this 
great recognition and on creating serv-
ice-minded students. 
’Ray Bucknell. 
CALLING FOR BIPARTISAN 
RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address three issues of critical 
importance to my constituents. 
The first is the urgent need to pre-
pare for the coronavirus. 
Mr. Speaker, public health officials 
are now reporting the first presumed 
positive test in my home State of New 
Hampshire. 
As Members of Congress, our fore-
most responsibility is to keep our com-
munities safe. That is why, yesterday, 
I joined Governor Sununu and my col-
leagues in the New Hampshire congres-
sional delegation to receive an update 
from public health officials on our 
State’s ongoing efforts to combat this 
epidemic. 
The State of New Hampshire is cur-
rently ramping up testing capabilities, 
investigating potential cases, commu-
nicating with Federal partners, and 
working with individual communities 
on containment and mitigation. 
Here in Washington, we must ensure 
that the emergency coronavirus spend-
ing package is responsive to the urgent 
needs of State and local public health 
officials who are on the front lines of 
this situation. 
We can only succeed in containing 
the virus if States like New Hampshire 
can depend on the full support of the 
Federal Government for costs associ-
ated with the response effort. 
Mr. Speaker, if there were ever a mo-
ment for a renewed spirit of bipartisan-
ship in Congress, this is it, as our coun-
try focuses on the deadly virus out-
break. 
We must communicate health infor-
mation clearly. We must develop effec-
tive and affordable vaccines that are 
made available to all who need them. 
And we must ensure that State and 
local governments, as well as medical 
facilities, can sustain the arduous task 
of containing this outbreak in the 
weeks and months ahead. 
The American people are looking to 
us for levelheaded leadership that rises 
above politics, and we can’t let them 
down. 
Let’s pass a robust coronavirus pack-
age as soon as possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I continue to encourage 
all of my constituents to follow the 
CDC safety guidelines and to visit the 
New Hampshire Department of Health 
and Human Services website for up-
dated health information. 
PROGRESS NEEDED ON CARE FOR VETERANS 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I also rise 
today in support of veterans who are 
seeking services in the community and 
the providers who care for them. 
For too long, hospitals and providers 
in New Hampshire have been owed mil-
lions of dollars in unpaid claims for the 
care they provide to veterans. 
The community care providers im-
pacted include large hospital networks,

home healthcare providers, massage 
therapists, and acupuncturists. 
I have personally met with these 
local providers to hear their stories, 
and I have convened meetings of af-
fected stakeholders in New Hampshire 
and here in Washington. 
Here is the bottom line: Without real 
progress, the MISSION Act will never 
fulfill its promise, and care for our vet-
erans will be compromised. 
Last week, at a hearing of the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, I received 
a promise from Secretary Wilkie that 
the VA will take immediate action to 
fix these persistent payment issues for 
community providers in New Hamp-
shire and across the country. We have 
to hold the VA to this commitment. 
My office is bringing VA leaders, vet-
erans, providers, and third-party ad-
ministrators to the table to solve these 
problems once and for all. 
When our veterans return home, they 
shouldn’t have to fight to receive the 
care that they have earned, and local 
providers shouldn’t have to fight a 
stubborn bureaucracy just to get their 
bills paid, to keep their doors open, and 
to continue treating our veterans. 
We can and must do better on this 
front. 
EMPOWERING PARENTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
Mr. PAPPAS. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to talk about empowering 
parents in New Hampshire to develop 
the skills they need to pursue the 
American Dream. 
No parent should have to choose be-
tween caring for a child and providing 
a better life for their families. 
That is why I am introducing the 
American Job Centers Family Accessi-
bility Act, which will create a competi-
tive grant program for job centers to 
provide access to childcare for individ-
uals receiving services at their centers. 
In 2018, more than 5.4 million unem-
ployed workers, including more than 
500,000 veterans, took advantage of ca-
reer services at job centers in their 
communities. But despite clear evi-
dence that job centers are effective, 
barriers to access for jobseekers still 
remain. 
In New Hampshire, State officials 
tell me that the number one obstacle 
to job training is access to childcare. 
No one who works hard and wants to 
develop new skills should be denied 
that opportunity simply because they 
can’t find quality, affordable childcare 
for their kids. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the American Job Centers 
Family Accessibility Act so that work-
ing mothers and fathers aren’t unfairly 
denied the chance to earn a better job 
and a better life for their families. 
f 
CONGRATULATING STACIE 
KONVICKA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise 
to 
congratulate 
Mrs. 
Stacie 
Konvicka, who was this year’s recipi-
ent of the Educator of the Year Award 
from the Wharton County Chamber of 
Commerce and Agriculture. 
This award is given to a teacher who 
exemplifies 
professionalism, 
dedica-
tion, leadership, and enthusiasm. 
Mrs. Konvicka is a fourth grade math 
and science teacher at Wharton Ele-
mentary School. 
Having been a teacher for 22 years, 
she has learned the value of going 
above and beyond for her students in 
the classroom. 
Wharton Elementary School is a title 
I campus, which means over 90 percent 
of the students come from economi-
cally disadvantaged homes. 
Mrs. Konvicka invests so much into 
her students. At the end of the day, she 
wants to ensure that they feel cared 
for. 
Many have benefited from her high- 
quality instruction as they are pushed 
to do their best. 
American ragtime composer Scott 
Hayden once said: ‘‘Teachers have 
three loves: the love of learning, the 
love of learners, and the love of bring-
ing the first two loves together.’’ 
Mrs. Stacie Konvicka has these three 
loves, and we, as south Texans, are 
thankful for her service in lovingly 
shaping the minds of future genera-
tions. 
REMEMBERING MARIE JORDAN SPEER 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
remember 
Marie 
Jordan 
Speer, who passed away at 98 years of 
age in Corpus Christi, Texas, on Octo-
ber 19, 2019. 
Marie’s 
kindness 
and 
compassion 
touched the lives of those around her, 
and through her various achievements, 
she served her community well. 
In 1942, she married Mr. Edward Jor-
dan, but 2 years later, he was drafted to 
fight in World War II and heroically, 
but tragically, died in combat. 
Marie ultimately used her suffering 
and loss to help others. She founded 
the Gold Star Wives of America in 
order to comfort and create a commu-
nity for other widows who had lost 
their husbands in the war. 
The first meeting she organized was a 
lunch with other military widows from 
town. This lunch morphed into a small 
volunteer group, which, in time, grew 
into a national organization that today 
has 35 chapters throughout the United 
States. 
The Gold Star Wives not only provide 
comfort and support for families who 
have lost loved ones; on Capitol Hill, 
they fight to secure victories for the 
spouses and children of fallen soldiers. 
We owe these families a debt that we 
cannot repay. Their husbands and fa-
thers have made the ultimate sacrifice 
in order to protect our country. 
Today, and every day, we pray for 
God’s peace for these families. 
Marie continued to work on behalf of 
the Gold Star Wives, eventually set-
tling in Corpus Christi, Texas, where 
she started three local newspapers and 
became heavily involved in the Coastal 
Bend community. 
South Texas is a better place because 
of Marie. Her life truly is a testament 
to the power of sacrificial love, deter-
mination, and compassion. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Marie’s family 
for sharing Marie with our Nation. We 
are sorry for their loss.

LEADERS DOING GREAT JOB ON 
CORONAVIRUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to dis-
cuss the coronavirus. 
I want to reassure folks that since we 
first learned about this virus, our gov-
ernment has been very proactive in its 
response. 
The President took charge and as-
sembled a task force, headed by the 
Vice President, that brought together 
the best and the brightest doctors, sci-
entists, and health experts that our 
country has to offer. 
The President also took the crucial 
step of implementing a travel ban on 
China to slow down the spread of the 
outbreak within our borders. 
While 
our 
government 
is 
appro-
priately handling the spread of the 
coronavirus, our citizens can help as 
well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to go to 
cdc.gov, follow the latest develop-
ments, and learn about easy ways that 
you can avoid getting sick. 
America must always be ahead of the 
game on viral threats like these, and I 
am proud to say that our leaders are 
doing a great job.

ESSENTIAL SUPPORT FAITH-BASED 
ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE FOR COMMUNITIES 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to highlight the essential support that 
faith-based organizations give to the 
communities around them, including 
during times of crisis. 
During Hurricane Florence, in 2018, 
volunteers 
from 
Samaritan’s 
Purse 
were on the ground after the hurricane 
had devastated thousands of homes 
across my State. 
Lorraine Jenkins, a resident of New 
Bern, my mother’s childhood home in 
North Carolina, said that she ‘‘had 
faith 
but 
needed 
a 
little 
more 
strength’’ when she returned to her 
home to find it flooded with 18 inches 
of water. Thankfully, several volun-
teers from Samaritan’s Purse were 
there to pray with Lorraine to give her 
the strength that she needed. 
During Hurricane Dorian, in 2019, the 
Salvation Army provided over 43,000 
meals, 55,000 drinks, 25,000 snacks, and 
48 full cleanup kits to victims. 
Mr. Speaker, faith-based organiza-
tions also provide key support services 
to children, many of whom are victims 
of the opioid crisis. This crisis has left 
over 92,000 children in foster care and 
in need of loving homes. Faith-based 
adoption agencies play a pivotal role in 
finding homes for these children.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1445 
March 3, 2020 
Sadly, despite the clear benefits 
faith-based organizations provide to 
the communities around them, there 
remains an ongoing push to strip them 
of Federal funding or to even shut 
them down for following their sincerely 
held religious beliefs. That is why, this 
week, I am introducing the Equal 
Treatment of Faith-Based Organiza-
tions Act, along with several of my col-
leagues. 
My bill codifies into law parts of the 
recently proposed HHS rule to ensure 
equal treatment for faith-based organi-
zations. My bill reverses the discrimi-
natory policy from the previous admin-
istration that required faith-based pro-
viders of social services to disclose 
their religious affiliation and refer po-
tential clients to other providers. My 
bill also allows faith-based organiza-
tions to apply for Federal funding on 
equal footing with secular organiza-
tions. 
Mr. Speaker, the Federal Govern-
ment has no business discriminating 
against faith-based organizations pure-
ly on the basis of their sincerely held 
religious beliefs. I am proud to lead 
this legislation and to protect the good 
work that faith-based organizations do 
every day.

SENATE DEMOCRATS BLOCK PRO- 
LIFE VOTE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, Senate Democrats blocked a 
vote in the Senate on two pro-life bills: 
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, which would require doc-
tors to provide medical care to a child 
who survives an abortion, and the 
Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection 
Act, which would ban abortions begin-
ning at 20 weeks. Senate Democrats 
prevented a vote on both of these com-
monsense bills as House Democrats 
have already done 80 times. 
I call on the Democrats on both sides 
of the Capitol, as Senate Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL said last week, to 
take a ‘‘clear and moral stand’’ to pro-
tect innocent life. 
SEVERE WEATHER AWARENESS WEEK 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this 
week is Severe Weather Awareness 
Week, and it is a good reminder to al-
ways be prepared for extreme weather 
events, which we too often face in Kan-
sas. 
Ready.gov—that 
is, 
r-e-a-d-y.gov— 
which is run by FEMA, is a great place 
to find resources related to flooding, 
thunderstorms, winter weather, or ad-
vice on building an emergency kit. 
Similarly, 
FEMA 
offers 
a 
free 
smartphone app which provides real- 
time alerts, shelter locations, and 
other resources to help during and 
after a severe weather event. 
But it is not enough to just commu-
nicate severe weather events to the 
public. We need to continue to invest 
in tools and encourage innovation 
when it comes to weather modeling and 
forecasting so that we can ensure as 
much lead time as possible before a se-
vere weather event occurs. 
From coastal regions to the heart-
land, severe weather impacts us all, 
and the Federal Government not only 
needs to be working with public and 
private partners to improve systems, 
but also to encourage and incentivize 
innovation in the field. 
Recently, the House Science, Space, 
and Technology Committee has taken 
a look at the various forecasting and 
modeling efforts across the country 
and discussed how we can better im-
prove these systems to give people in-
creased warning in the event of severe 
weather events. 
Furthermore, I met with those on the 
front line in forecasting, such as our 
hardworking 
meteorologists 
back 
home at our National Weather Service, 
along with research institutions across 
the country, discussing the advances 
they are making thanks to new tools 
and technologies. 
It is important to stay safe, in-
formed, and prepared as we head into 
the severe weather season, and I hope 
all Americans will take advantage of 
the tools available to achieve these 
goals. 
STEPS UNITED STATES IS TAKING TO RESPOND 
TO CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, the 
spread of the coronavirus and its domi-
nance in the news has been at the top 
of my mind as well as for many Kan-
sans. 
While there is no reason to panic, it 
is prudent for all of us to be mindful of 
the ongoing challenging situation. As a 
physician and Congressman, I feel it is 
important that I convey the steps the 
Federal Government is currently tak-
ing to best respond. 
First, we must demand more trans-
parency from the Chinese and Iranian 
Governments. American experts must 
be allowed to get access to information 
on the ground in both China and Iran, 
particularly in Wuhan—ground zero of 
the 
outbreak. 
Unfortunately, 
these 
countries have a long history of misin-
formation and coverups, and we need to 
know the full truth to best protect 
Americans. 
Some in the American medical indus-
try are concerned about a shortage of 
supplies which are largely manufac-
tured in China. Currently, the FDA is 
not aware of any national shortages of 
medical 
products. 
Federal 
agencies 
have been proactively reaching out to 
hundreds of manufacturers to assess 
potential shortages and to let manufac-
turers know they can provide assist-
ance. That being said, this is an excel-
lent time to review our supply chain 
for both American healthcare as well 
as all other industries. 
I personally believe President Trump 
and Vice President Pence are doing ev-
erything in their power to protect 
Americans. Consulting with the top 
medical experts, this administration is 
moving to swiftly mitigate outbreaks 
of coronavirus here at home. 
Attempts by the national media and 
Democrats in Congress to place blame 
on the President for these outbreaks 
are 
inexcusable—they 
are 
unpro-
fessional; they are unnecessary; and 
they are actually very harmful. 
Anything President Trump can pos-
sibly do to expedite the development of 
testing, antivirals, and vaccines is al-
ready being done—and, I might add, is 
being accomplished in record time. 
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and the Department of 
Health and Human Services have been 
preparing for outbreaks like this for 
years. We are the most prepared and 
the best equipped nation in the world 
to take on this coronavirus. 
On the eve of a potentially global 
epidemic, this situation underscores 
how imperative it is for our country to 
be able to prevent unidentified individ-
uals from entering this country. Border 
security is national security, and fami-
lies in Kansas deserve a home safe from 
unvetted individuals who may know-
ingly or unknowingly be carrying con-
tagious diseases. 
I visited with the CDC over 5 weeks 
ago, asking what preventative meas-
ures they were taking when this virus 
was in the early stages of outbreak. I 
have been staying in close, constant 
contact with the White House, the 
CDC, and all agencies responsible for 
controlling the spread of this disease. 
The safety of Kansans is my top pri-
ority, and I will continue monitoring 
developments closely and communicate 
with officials across our State. 
In the meantime, as a physician, I 
recommend some commonsense prac-
tices: regular handwashing, applying 
hand sanitizer, proper nutrition, and 
minimal travel outside your commu-
nity. This is a time to prepare and 
plan, a time to make sure you have a 
plan for your children, for your elderly 
parents, perhaps, that you have a plan 
for your place of work and for your 
place of worship, wherever you might 
gather in your own community. 
The event also underscores what an 
absolute disaster a government take-
over of the medical system would be. 
America’s healthcare capabilities are 
second to none because of competition 
and free market innovation. Radical 
socialist 
policies 
would 
effectively 
eliminate private investment in new 
medicines 
and 
technologies. 
That 
would be unacceptable.

OPPOSITION TO THE NEW WAY

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my firm opposition to 
the New Way Forward Act, a radical 
piece of legislation that would put 
American lives at risk in numerous

those who have been deported to come 
back to the United States legally and 
on the taxpayer’s dime—essentially al-
lowing for the importation of violent 
and dangerous illegal immigrants into 
our country. I have yet to meet a sin-
gle person who supports that idea. 
The bill would also decriminalize il-
legal entry into the country, including 
for criminals who have already been 
deported. 
This measure is a dream for those 
who seek to abolish ICE, throw open 
our national borders, and gut the rule 
of law in America. 
I have heard from constituents who 
are outraged about this proposal—and 
rightfully so. While sponsored by near-
ly a fifth of the House Democratic Cau-
cus, the legislation stands little chance 
of advancing past President Trump or a 
Republican Senate. But it is, nonethe-
less, important for the American peo-
ple to know the priorities of some 
Members of this body. 
I will continue to stand strong 
against policies like the New Way For-
ward Act and any other legislation 
which would encourage illegal immi-
gration and cripple the safety of Amer-
ican citizens. 
HONORING BAM CARNEY 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to encourage the body to keep 
my dear friend, Bam Carney, of Camp-
bellsville, Kentucky, in their thoughts 
and prayers as he continues to battle a 
serious illness. 
Bam has been hospitalized for over 2 
months and has a long journey ahead. 
However, anyone who knows Bam 
knows that he is the ultimate fighter. 
As a father, educator, State rep-
resentative, and Kentucky’s house ma-
jority leader, he has always fought 
strongly for what he believes in. But, 
more 
importantly, 
he 
has 
always 
fought for his family and friends above 
all else. 
Bam’s community has organized ‘‘A 
Day of Prayer and Encouragement for 
Bam,’’ where people across Kentucky 
are joining together to lift him up in 
prayer. 
I ask for this body to join me in 
keeping my friend and golf buddy in 
their thoughts and prayers. He means 
so much to so many people. I ask ev-
eryone for their prayers as Bam con-
tinues his fight.

solutions to the issues facing our Na-
tion, solutions which often seem so dis-
tant. 
On a day of major electoral impact,

fects of the coronavirus, grace us with 
the assurance that You are with us in

May we all understand that a unified 
nation is equally the work of each of us

May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory.

TENNESSEE NEEDS EMERGENCY 
DISASTER RELIEF 
(Mr. COOPER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COOPER. Madam Speaker, very 
early this morning, my hometown of 
Nashville, Tennessee, was terribly hard 
hit by a tornado. 
At least 19 lives have been lost. 
Buildings were destroyed. Many, many 
homes were destroyed, and countless 
lives have been disrupted. At least 
34,000 people lost electricity. 
I have been in contact with our Gov-
ernor, our mayor, our entire congres-
sional delegation, including my good 
friend JOHN ROSE, to do all that we can 
to bring emergency relief to the area as 
fast as possible. 
This is a genuine tragedy, and we 
need to praise our neighbors, friends, 
residents, first responders, firefighters, 
police, and EMTs who worked all 
through the night, despite fierce rains, 
to provide first aid. 
Nashville is strong. We recovered so 
well after the terrible 2010 flood that 
many parts of America didn’t even 
know we had been suffering. 
Now is the time to beat this disaster.

PLEDGE FOR AID IN RESPONSE TO 
TENNESSEE TORNADOES 
(Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise with my 
colleague from Tennessee, Mr. COOPER. 
As he has already indicated, earlier 
today, a devastating tornado 
tore 
through Middle Tennessee, including 
much of the area that I represent and 
call home. 
While rescue workers are still in the 
critical phase of sorting through debris 
and accounting for those who are still 
missing, we know already that many 
lives have been lost and dozens of peo-
ple were rushed to emergency rooms. 
I, along with countless Tennesseans, 
are lifting those people up in prayer, 
and we hope that everybody will join 
us. 
I am working diligently alongside my 
fellow Representatives, the administra-
tion, Governor Lee, Senators ALEX-
ANDER and BLACKBURN, and emergency 
officials to get much-needed Federal 
aid to the affected areas. 
Homes, schools, businesses, churches, 
farms, and other buildings and numer-
ous communities have suffered serious 
and, in some cases, overwhelming dam-
age. 
I stand today with those affected by 
this disaster and pledge every effort 
will be made to give shelter to those 
who need it, give care to those who are 
hurt, and give assistance in the critical 
effort to recover and rebuild.

FUND CORONAVIRUS RESEARCH 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, this week, the House should 
consider legislation responding to the 
threat 
of 
COVID–19, 
called 
the 
coronavirus, that poses a significant 
threat to our Nation. 
Since the end of December, over 3,000 
people worldwide have died from the 
virus, and there are over 91,000 con-
firmed cases. Without a specific treat-
ment protocol or vaccine, the virus is 
dangerous and will likely reach the 
level of a pandemic. 
We need to fund scientific research 
that can quickly diagnose and provide 
therapies to prevent and treat the 
virus.

RECOGNIZING 
NATIONAL 
TRIPLE 
NEGATIVE 
BREAST 
CANCER 
AWARENESS DAY 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of National Triple Neg-
ative Breast Cancer Awareness Day, 
which is recognized around the country 
on March 3 each year. 
This day is especially meaningful for 
me, as my daughter, Lauren, battled 
triple negative breast cancer for nearly 
2 years before her death in August 2017. 
Between 10 and 20 percent of breast 
cancer patients are triple negative, 
meaning they don’t respond to tradi-
tional hormone therapies. They are 
considered more aggressive cancers, 
and the prognosis is poor. 
My daughter was very public in her 
fight against breast cancer, and I know 
that she would want me to use today to 
raise awareness and to encourage those 
at risk to be screened. 
I am humbled to have reintroduced a 
resolution officially designating this 
day in the hopes that, together, we can 
bring greater awareness of triple nega-
tive breast cancer and encourage early 
detection and treatment. 
May we resolve to fight together 
with the strength and courage that 
Lauren demonstrated each and every 
day to finally find a cure for this awful 
and dreaded disease. 
f 
EXTEND PAID FAMILY LEAVE TO 
MORE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES 
(Mr. BALDERSON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on an issue that touches 
the lives of countless Ohioans because 
it affects everyone with loved ones and 
family members. 
When a hardworking Federal em-
ployee gives birth to a child, has a par-
ent is in the hospital, or needs to take 
leave for any medical or family-related 
reason, they are able to do so through 
paid family leave. 
Sadly, thousands of Federal employ-
ees, many of whom live and work in 
Ohio’s 
12th 
Congressional 
District, 
were left out of the most recent reau-
thorization of paid family leave for 
Federal employees. 
These TSA agents; FAA workers, in-
cluding air traffic controllers at John 
Glenn Airport; and VA healthcare pro-
viders, such as doctors, dentists, and 
nurses, work hard. They deserve to 
take time off for medical and family 
reasons without affecting their pay. 
That is why I introduced the VAlue 
FAAmily Act, which would correct this 
oversight and extend 12 weeks of paid 
family leave to these forgotten em-
ployees. 
FMLA, and the lives of Federal em-
ployees, should not be compromised. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
cosponsor 
H.R. 
5993, 
the 
VAlue 
FAAmily Act. 
f 
ST. CROIX NEEDS PERMANENT 
DIALYSIS FACILITY 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, in 
2017, due to natural disaster and lack of 
electricity, 200 dialysis patients were 
forced to evacuate the Virgin Islands. 
Some never returned; some are still 
hoping to; and some who did may once 
again have to leave. Patients on St. 
Croix are still receiving treatment in a 
mobile unit that faces an uncertain fu-
ture. 
FEMA has slow-walked the release of 
funding and guidelines that will allow 
our hospital to build a permanent and 
comfortable facility on the island for 
lifesaving dialysis treatment. 
The Centers for Medicaid and Medi-
care Services, CMS, has refused to re-
certify the temporary mobile unit, in-
stead giving the unit month-to-month 
extensions, citing that, by now, there 
should have been a more permanent 
structure. 
Stuck between FEMA’s slow-walk 
and CMS’ decision are people, people 
who need stability and empathy. If 
these Americans are forced to make 
the hard decision as to whether to 
leave home again, these Federal agen-
cies would have failed them. 
At least 15 of the dialysis patients 
who were forced to leave the first time 
are no longer with us. They passed 
away before they were able to come 
home. 
This National Kidney Month, let’s 
work to ensure that this doesn’t hap-
pen again.

lectors who contact servicemembers’ 
superiors. 
The U.S. military does not owe these 
debts; they are the debt of the service-
member. So why should debt collectors 
be in contact with someone who does 
not owe the debt? 
From a readiness perspective, our 
commanding officers and noncommis-
sioned officers should be focused on 
training our soldiers to fight and win 
our Nation’s wars, not on keeping 
track of who owes what money to what 
debt collector. 
Just as debt collectors cannot hu-
miliate 
civilians 
by 
calling 
their 
bosses, neither should they be allowed 
to use such practices on our fighting 
men and women. I am glad to see that 
we can all agree that collection compa-
nies should abide by the same rules and 
restrictions for enlisted servicemem-
bers as they do when collecting debts 
from private citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage the Senate 
to take up this bill immediately.

more are being monitored. Across the 
globe, more than 90,000 are sick and 
3,000 have died. 
Rhode Islanders and all Americans 
deserve a strong, effective, and fully 
funded response to this health crisis. 
That is why the House will vote this 
week on an emergency appropriations 
bill that addresses the scale and seri-
ousness of the coronavirus epidemic. 
This bill will ensure public health offi-
cials have the resources they need 
right now. 
It is critical that the Senate send it 
to the President’s desk as soon as the 
House acts, and, for his part, the Presi-
dent needs to stop calling this situa-
tion a hoax. This isn’t about him; it is 
about protecting the American people. 
When the bill gets to his desk, he 
should sign it and then step aside and 
let the scientists, the doctors, and the 
public health experts do their jobs. 
This is no time for politics. It is 
about keeping the American people 
safe. The House will do our job. The 
President should start doing his. 
f 
AMERICA WILL ADAPT TO MEET 
CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH 
CORONAVIRUS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, as com-
pared to other historic viruses and out-
breaks 
in 
recent 
years, 
the 
coronavirus, so far, is a lesser threat. 
Let’s compare it to H1N1, also known 
as the swine flu of 2009. The CDC has 
estimated that approximately 60 mil-
lion people in the U.S. contracted H1N1 
during that 2009 outbreak, leading to 
the death of around 12,000 Americans. 
Even more alarming, during this cur-
rent 
2019–2020 
flu 
season, 
approxi-
mately 18,000 people, unfortunately, 
have died as a result of the more con-
ventional flu. Currently, in the U.S., 
there 
are 
105 
confirmed 
cases 
of 
coronavirus, resulting in the unfortu-
nate death of six people so far. We ex-
pect these numbers will go up. 
While this outbreak is, indeed, a 
problem, the CDC, not politicians, con-
tinue to claim that the American pub-
lic are unlikely to be exposed to 
coronavirus. 
During the Republican majority in 
Congress, we made several strategic in-
vestments in key health resources to 
prevent the spread of a virus like this 
one, including a 24 percent increase in 
CDC funding and a 70 percent increase 
in infectious disease response. 
So, instead of sounding an alarm, I 
encourage my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to continue to remind 
Americans that our country will adapt 
to the challenges coming. 
For people, individually: Work on 
limiting your own risk by washing 
your hands frequently. 
HONORING KATY CHRISTIAN 
MINISTRIES 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
OLSON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
with 
Easter around the corner, I rise to heap 
praise on an icon in Katy, Texas, in 
Fort Bend County. Her name is Deysi 
Crespo. She is the CEO of Katy Chris-
tian Ministries, otherwise known as 
KCM. 
KCM has one holy mission: trans-
forming life through God’s grace and 
generosity of the community. 
KCM has 52 member churches, part-
ners. Deysi started there as a volunteer 
in the resale shop in 2007. 
Deysi is a living, breathing example 
that 
the 
American 
Dream 
comes 
through faith. At 7 years old, she left 
rampant poverty in Central America 
for Katy, Texas. After a few months, 
she no longer hungered for food. 
Deysi had a building hunger inside of 
her body to end poverty for others and 
intervene in crisis with God’s love. The 
rest is history. Under Deysi’s leader-
ship, KCM earned a four-star rating 
from Charity Navigator and the Hurri-
cane Harvey Response Award from the 
Houston Food Bank. 
If you are in Katy this March, say 
hola, or hello, to Deysi. She will be at 
the Katy Charity Bubble Run. That is 
set on March 28 in Katy, Texas, and 
Deysi guarantees the love of Christ will 
be waiting for all who come to the Bub-
ble Run.

CONDEMNING 
CONTINUED 
VIO-
LENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS BY 
ARMED GROUPS IN THE CEN-
TRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 387) condemning 
continued violence against civilians by 
armed groups in the Central African 
Republic and supporting efforts to 
achieve a lasting political solution to 
the conflict, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 387 
Whereas the overthrow of the Government 
of the Central African Republic in March 
2013 and subsequent violence has led to the 
proliferation 
of 
multiple 
armed groups, 
which have been responsible for widespread 
atrocities based on perceived or actual reli-
gious or ethnic identities; 
Whereas the United Nations (UN) con-
cluded in 2014 that the Central African Re-
public’s minority Muslim community had 
been the target of ethnic cleansing, and mul-
tiple UN officials have warned of a risk of 
genocide; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations, 
an estimated 2,900,000 people are in need of 
humanitarian assistance, over 590,000 Central 
Africans are refugees in neighboring coun-
tries, and over 640,000 people are displaced, 
most of whom are women and children; 
Whereas armed groups continue to engage 
in gross human rights abuses, violence, pil-
laging, and the illicit trafficking of natural 
resources such as ivory, gold, cattle, and dia-
monds; 
Whereas armed groups have intentionally 
targeted personnel from the United Nations 
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization 
Mission in the Central African Republic 
(MINUSCA), aid workers, and journalists, 
making the Central African Republic one of 
the world’s most dangerous operating envi-
ronments for humanitarian actors; 
Whereas the Central African Republic has 
made significant progress toward democracy 
by conducting democratic elections despite 
the lack of security around electoral polling 
stations and some irregularities, and inaugu-
rated President Faustin-Archange Touade´ra 
in March 2016; 
Whereas the establishment of the Special 
Criminal Court in June 2017 and the creation 
of more than 1,000 peace committees across 
the country demonstrate a genuine commit-
ment to justice and accountability on the 
part of the people of the Central African Re-
public; and 
Whereas, since 2013, the United States has 
been the largest single donor to the humani-
tarian response in the Central African Re-
public, promoted peace and social cohesion, 
supported the deployment of MINUSCA, en-
acted sanctions against senior leaders of 
armed groups, and provided life-saving as-
sistance to communities in the Central Afri-
can Republic affected by the crisis: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) recognizes that strong United States 
leadership and support for the stability of 
the Central African Republic is necessary for 
the security and future stability of the re-
gion; 
(2) condemns violence against civilians, 
humanitarian 
workers, 
journalists, 
faith 
leaders, and United Nations peacekeepers by 
all armed actors operating within the Cen-
tral African Republic;

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) and the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
387. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 387 and thank my colleagues 
for their support of this bipartisan res-
olution. 
As the gentleman knows, the desta-
bilizing overthrow of the Government 
of the Central African Republic, or 
CAR, in March 2013 has led to a pro-
liferation of armed rebel groups which 
have been responsible for widespread 
atrocities based on religious or ethnic 
identities during this bloody conflict. 
In 2014, the U.N. concluded that CAR’s 
minority Muslim community had been 
the target of ethnic cleansing, and 
multiple U.N. officials have warned of 
a risk of genocide. 
These armed groups continue to en-
gage in gross human rights abuses, in-
cluding violence, pillaging, and the il-
licit trafficking of natural resources 
such as ivory, gold, cattle, and dia-
monds. 
However, despite the lack of security 
around electoral polling stations, CAR 
has made significant progress toward 
democracy by conducting democratic 
elections, 
ultimately 
inaugurating 
President Touadera in March of 2016. 
Yet, armed groups still control much of 
the country’s territory, ethnic and reli-
gious violence occurs frequently, and 
the central government still struggles 
with basic security and governance. 
Despite these challenges, the central 
government and armed groups signed a 
landmark peace deal in February of 
2019 that lays out a path toward a 
unity government, demobilization of 
nonstate combatants, and the creation 
of interim-mixed security units com-
promising security forces and former 
rebels. 
The United States has a long history 
supporting CAR, establishing diplo-
matic relations in 1960 following their 
independence from France. U.S. bilat-
eral aid to CAR totaled $34 million in 
fiscal year 2018, including $18 million in 
food aid, $13 million in security aid, 
and $3 million in development aid. 
Despite this, the United Nations esti-
mates 2.9 million people need humani-
tarian assistance, and over 640,000 peo-
ple have been displaced due to this con-
flict, most of whom are children and 
women. 
The United States has played an im-
portant role in brokering peace in 
CAR, and is currently the largest inter-
national donor, helping to strengthen 
the central government, increase secu-
rity, and maintain peace. 
Actors, such as Russia, have engaged 
in CAR in ways that are detrimental to 
American interests; therefore, it is 
vital that we continue to support the 
people of CAR in achieving peace and a 
democratic transition. That is why I 
am proud to sponsor this legislation, to 
reiterate that Congress and the United 
States Government is committed to 
achieving peace in CAR. 
Specifically, 
this 
resolution 
con-
demns violence against civilians, hu-
manitarian workers, journalists, faith 
leaders, and United Nations peace-
keepers by all armed groups operating 
within the Central African Republic. 
It welcomes the signing of the Khar-
toum Peace Agreement in February 
2019 and urges all parties to adhere to 
the terms of the agreement. 
It calls on the international commu-
nity, including all members of the 
United Nations Security Council as 
well as neighboring countries, to con-
tinually reassess and implement strat-
egies that demonstrate clear progress 
in achieving peace in the Central Afri-
can Republic. 
It calls on the Government of the 
Central African Republic to ensure 
that all state security forces adhere to 
civilian command, refrain from human 
rights abuses, and sever any and all 
links to armed groups, except in the 
framework of disarmament, demobili-
zation, and reintegration under the 
peace agreement. 
It urges the State Department and 
USAID to take steps to ensure that 
American assistance programs support 
local sustainable agriculture, other de-
velopment efforts to create human 
well-being, and peace in CAR. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of this resolution to condemn contin-
ued violence against civilians by armed 
groups in the Central African Republic 
and supporting efforts to achieve last-
ing peace in the country. 
I want to thank my colleagues, Con-
gressman CICILLINE and Congressman 
FORTENBERRY, for introducing this res-
olution and for their commitment to 
this important issue. 
Since the fighting began in 2013, 
thousands of civilians have been killed. 
Over half of the population is in need of 
humanitarian assistance, and more 
than 1 million people have been dis-
placed from their homes. 
Still, today, most of the country re-
mains under armed group control, and 
the democratically elected government 
continues to struggle to project any 
state authority. The humanitarian suf-
fering is dire. 
I am also deeply concerned with the 
rapid increase in Russian activity 
across the country. AFRICOM Com-
mander General Townsend testified

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1450 
March 3, 2020 
last month that Russia is deploying 
paramilitary contractors, extracting 
minerals, and attempting to buy influ-
ence in the Central African Republic. 
This includes the notorious Wagner 
Group mercenaries responsible for hor-
rible atrocities in Libya and Syria. 
Russian malign activity in Central Af-
rican Republic is further destabilizing 
this fragile and war-torn country. 
This resolution urges all parties to 
fully adhere to the terms of the Feb-
ruary 2019 peace agreement and cease 
attacks on civilians. It also calls on 
the international community to in-
crease engagement to support efforts 
to implement the peace agreement and 
combat Russian malign influence. I 
urge my colleagues to support this bi-
partisan resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I again want 
to thank my colleagues for their hard 
work to highlight the situation in the 
Central African Republic. 
The U.S. is both the largest donor of 
humanitarian assistance and largest 
contributor to U.N. peacekeeping oper-
ations in the Central African Republic. 
Our assistance provides critical food 
and medicine to vulnerable and remote 
populations. 
However, 
the 
critical 
needs remain, and we must urge our 
partners to do more. Supporting last-
ing peace and efforts to stabilize the 
Central African Republic is in the U.S. 
interest. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I once again thank the

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

MALALA YOUSAFZAI 
SCHOLARSHIP ACT 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4508) to expand the number of 
scholarships available to Pakistani 
women under the Merit and Needs- 
Based Scholarship Program, as amend-
ed. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4508 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Malala 
Yousafzai Scholarship Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) In late 2008, Malala Yousafzai began 
making the case for access to education for 
women and girls despite objections from the 
Pakistani Taliban. On October 9, 2012, Malala 
was shot in the head by Pakistani Taliban on 
her way home from school. 
(2) In 2013, Malala Yousafzai and her father 
Ziauddin Yousafzai co-founded the Malala 
Fund. The Malala Fund works to secure 
twelve years of free, safe, and quality edu-
cation for all girls. Completion of a full 
twelve-year cycle of primary and secondary 
education ensures a pipeline of girls able to 
pursue higher education. 
(3) On July 12, 2013, Malala delivered a 
speech before the United Nations General As-
sembly calling for expanded access to edu-
cation for women and girls across the globe. 
She said, ‘‘[L]et us wage a glorious struggle 
against illiteracy, poverty, and terrorism. 
Let us pick up our books and our pens. They 
are the most powerful weapons . . . Edu-
cation is the only solution.’’. 
(4) On October 10, 2014, Malala Yousafzai 
became the co-recipient of the Nobel Peace 
Prize for her ‘‘struggle against the suppres-
sion of children and young people and for the 
right of all children to education’’. 
(5) According to the United Nations 2016 
Global Education Monitoring Report, more 
than 130 million girls worldwide are out of 
school. 15 million girls of primary-school age 
will never enter a classroom. As of 2016, at 
least 500 million adult women across the 
globe are illiterate. 
(6) According to the World Bank, ‘‘Girls’ 
education is a strategic development pri-
ority. Better educated women tend to be 
healthier, participate more in the formal 
labor market, earn higher incomes, . . . 
marry at a later age, and enable better 
health care and education for their children, 
should they choose to become mothers. All 
these factors combined can help lift house-
holds, communities, and nations out of pov-
erty.’’. 
(7) In 2015, all United Nations Member 
States, including the United States, adopted 
quality education, including access to higher 
education, and gender equality as sustain-
able development goals to be attained by 
2030. One of the education goal targets is to 
‘‘ensure equal access for all women and men 
to affordable and quality technical, voca-
tional and tertiary education, including uni-
versity’’. 
(8) In January 2010, Secretary of State Hil-
lary Rodham Clinton stated, ‘‘We will open 
the doors of education to all citizens, but es-
pecially to girls and women . . . We are 
doing all of these things because we have 
seen that when women and girls have the 
tools to stay healthy and the opportunity to 
contribute to their families’’ well-being, 
they flourish and so do the people around 
them. 
(9) In February 2019, the White House 
launched the Women’s Global Development 
and Prosperity Initiative to advance wom-
en’s economic empowerment across the globe 
and reach more than 100,000 women. 
(10) The World Economic Forum ranks 
Pakistan the second lowest among all coun-
tries in the world evaluated for gender equal-
ity. On educational attainment for women, 
Pakistan is ranked the tenth lowest. 
(11) In Pakistan, the rate of higher edu-
cation enrollment beyond high school for 
girls and women is just 9 percent as reported 
by the World Bank. The global rate is 40 per-
cent. Less than 6 percent of women 25 and 
older in Pakistan attain a bachelor’s degree 
or equivalent as of 2016. 
(12) Factors such as poverty, early mar-
riage, disability, ethnicity, and religion can 
contribute to the lack of educational oppor-
tunities for women in marginalized commu-
nities. 
(13) According to the World Bank, ‘‘Higher 
education benefits both individuals and soci-
ety. Economic returns for college graduates 
are the highest in the entire educational sys-
tem—an average 17 percent increase in earn-
ings per year of schooling as compared with 
10 percent for primary school.’’. 
(14) The United States provides critical for-
eign assistance to Pakistan’s education sec-
tor to improve access to and the quality of 
basic and higher education. Since 2010, the 
United States Agency for International De-
velopment (referred to in this Act as 
‘‘USAID’’) has awarded more than 6,000 
scholarships for young women to receive 
higher education in Pakistan. 
(15) The Merit and Needs-Based Scholar-
ship 
Program 
administered 
by 
USAID 
awards scholarships to academically tal-
ented, financially needy Pakistani students 
from all regions, including female students 
from rural areas of the country, to pursue 
bachelor’s or master’s degrees at partici-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) and the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4508. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, when we break down 
the barriers holding women back, they 
lift up entire communities. Top econo-
mists back this up. The World Bank 
says that financing girls’ education has 
the highest return on investment in 
the developing world. We know that 
the impact isn’t just economic. When 
girls have access to education, they 
can inspire millions, empower their 
communities, and change the world. 
Look at Malala Yousafzai. Malala 
bravely put her education to use by 
blogging about the brutality of Taliban 
rule in her hometown and advocating 
for girls’ rights to education. 
The Pakistani Taliban tried to si-
lence her with a violent attack on her 
life. She survived, and she didn’t back 
down. Malala’s continued commitment 
to advancing women’s rights and ex-
panding access to education has reso-
nated with millions of people and 
spurred action around the world. 
When we look at Malala, we see an 
inspiring source of strength, of dedica-
tion, and of bravery. We also see what 
women are capable of when they have 
the opportunity to go to school and use 
their voices. So, I am pleased that we 
are moving forward this bill named in 
Malala’s honor that will strengthen the 
United States’ investments in edu-
cational opportunities for Pakistani 
girls. 
The Malala Yousafzai Scholarship 
Act will require that at least 50 percent 
of USAID’s Merit and Needs-Based 
Scholarships in Pakistan are awarded 
to women. 
I want to thank my colleague and 
friend from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES) 
for introducing this excellent measure. 
I am proud to support it, and I urge all 
my colleagues to join me in doing so. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of this bill which reauthorizes a USAID 
Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship 
program named after Malala Yousafzai. 
Malala is a Pakistani activist who 
began making the case for access to 
education for women and girls in 2008 
despite objections from the Pakistani 
Taliban. 
In October 2012, she was shot in the 
head by the Taliban in an assassination 
attempt in retaliation for her activism. 
Malala, just 15 years old at the time, 
miraculously survived and continues to 
fight for access to education for every 
child. 
I want to thank my colleagues, Con-
gressman 
JEFFRIES
and 
Congress-
woman WAGNER, for introducing this 
bill and for their work on this issue. 
Specifically, this bill authorizes for 3 
years a USAID Merit and Needs-Based 
Scholarship program to academically 
talented, financially needy Pakistani 
students to pursue a bachelor’s or mas-
ter’s degree at participating Pakistani 
universities. At least half of the num-
ber of scholarships shall go to women, 
and the administrator shall make 
every effort to award at least half of 
the scholarships under the program to 
go to Pakistani women. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to, again, 
really speak to the importance of this 
resolution, because we have examples 
all over the world of where, when 
women are empowered, it lifts up an 
entire community; and that when 
women have a voice, they not only con-
tribute to their own empowerment, 
their own development, and their own 
success, but have an enormous, posi-
tive impact on their local communities 
in the regions in which they live. 
It has often been said that one of the 
best investments we can make is in 
education, and I think Malala’s story is 
an 
example 
of 
the 
transformative 
power of education, not only in terms 
of economic security, but in terms of 
building democracy and civil society. 
So this legislation will ensure that 
we intentionally and purposefully in-
vest in young women and girls because 
of not only the impact it will have on 
their own lives but what it will mean 
to the communities they are a part of. 
I want to really applaud the chief 
sponsor of this, my friend and col-
league, HAKEEM JEFFRIES, the chair of 
the Democratic Caucus, who has really 
made this a priority in his work. 
During discussions in the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee there was bipartisan 
recognition of the significant invest-
ment in women and girls; that that had 
to be a priority, and that it would be a 
tool to advancing economic success, to 
advancing educational success, and to 
really help build a civil society. These 
are very often regions which, for a very 
long time, women and girls were ex-
cluded from those opportunities. 
So this resolution will be really 
transformative and will really help to 
ensure that Pakistan can serve as a 
model for what happens when you actu-
ally invest in women and girls and the 
difference it can make in the societies 
in that country that will be an exam-
ple, I think, to the rest of the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud the words of 
my colleague. I would add to that just 
a few thoughts. My mother grew up on 
a farm in Dingle, Idaho. Her high 
school class had eight people in it, and 
she traveled to New York City to get a 
master’s degree from New York Univer-
sity. 
I am so pleased for the women in my 
life and in our community who have 
led the way, but acknowledge, Mr. 
Speaker, that so many people around 
the world don’t have that same oppor-
tunity. For that, I applaud my col-
leagues for the work on this bill and 
for promoting this very important 
issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the very distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES), who is the author of this 
very important piece of legislation, the 
Democratic Caucus chair, and my 
friend. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, the distinguished gentleman 
from Rhode Island, for yielding and for 
his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4508, a bill to expand the pipeline of 
women and girls in Pakistan entering 
higher education. 
At home and abroad, women and girls 
face barriers to obtaining education, 
hindering their ability to fill their po-
tential. Barriers include the cost of 
education, inadequate infrastructure, 
violence, cultural norms, and gender 
discrimination. As a result, today at 
least 500 million women and girls 
across the globe struggle with literacy. 
In Pakistan, the hurdles that women 
and girls face when seeking education

are especially pronounced. In late 2008, 
Malala, whose name this bill is in 
honor of, began making the case for 
education for women and girls in Paki-
stan. 
Despite 
objections 
from 
the 
Taliban, she continued to advocate this 
cause at great personal risk. 
On October 9, 2012, Malala was on the 
way home when the Taliban ambushed 
her bus and shot her in the head. Re-
markably, she survived. Instead of 
stopping her efforts, she continued to 
speak out, to stand up, and to step out, 
becoming a world-renowned figure in 
the fight for education. 
As she said before the United Nations 
General Assembly: ‘‘So, let us wage a 
glorious struggle against illiteracy, 
poverty, and terrorism, let us pick up 
our books and our pens, they are the 
most powerful weapons. . . . Education 
is the only solution.’’ 
In October 2014, Malala became a co-
recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for 
her struggle against the suppression of 
children and young people and for the 
right of all children to education. 
To this day Malala continues her 
work in this area. 
Still, despite all the progress that 
has been made, only 32 percent of pri-
mary school-age girls are in school in 
Pakistan. After primary and secondary 
school, the rate of higher education en-
rollment for girls drops down to just 9 
percent. Less than 6 percent of women 
25 and older attain a bachelor’s degree 
or equivalent in Pakistan. 
The U.S. Agency For International 
Development’s Merit and Needs-Based 
Scholarship program currently funds 
full tuition and stipends for financially 
strained Pakistani youth to complete a 
bachelor’s or master’s degree at part-
ner universities across Pakistan. This 
legislation would ensure that at least 
half of those scholarship recipients go 
to Pakistani women. Empowering girls 
with access to education is not just the 
right thing to do, it is the smart thing 
to do for Pakistan and for the global 
community. 
I want to thank Chairman ENGEL and 
Ranking Member MCCAUL of the For-
eign Affairs Committee for their lead-
ership. I also want to thank Congress-
woman ANN WAGNER for her tremen-
dous leadership and for her partnership 
on this legislation to support every 
girl’s right to an education. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, in closing, 
I again want to thank my colleagues 
for their hard work to expand the num-
ber of scholarships available to Paki-
stani women under USAID’s Merit and 
Needs-Based Scholarship Program. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I want to ac-
knowledge the extraordinary work of 
USAID and their focus on education 
and how critical that is to the develop-
ment of communities all across the 
world and, importantly, that we fully 
fund USAID’s efforts, and also to rec-
ognize that this focus on education is a 
focus that continues to pay dividends. 
I particularly want to acknowledge 
the leadership of Chairman JEFFRIES in 
recognizing the particular responsi-
bility that we have to invest in women 
and girls and what a transformative 
difference that makes in countries. 
Pakistan will be able to show the world 
the difference that it makes when you 
give women and girls an opportunity to 
realize their full potential. This act 
will ensure that at least half of those 
scholarships go to girls. It is a very im-
portant piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4508, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-

TAIWAN ALLIES INTERNATIONAL 
PROTECTION 
AND 
ENHANCE-
MENT INITIATIVE (TAIPEI) ACT 
OF 2019 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(S. 1678) to express United States sup-
port for Taiwan’s diplomatic alliances 
around the world, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1678 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Taiwan Al-
lies International Protection and Enhance-
ment Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019’’. 
SEC. 2. DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 (Pub-
lic Law 96–8) states that it is the policy of 
the United States ‘‘to preserve and promote 
extensive, close, and friendly commercial, 
cultural, and other relations between the 
people of the United States and the people on 
Taiwan’’. 
(2) The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 states 
that it is the policy of the United States ‘‘to 
maintain the capacity of the United States 
to resist any resort to force or other forms of 
coercion that would jeopardize the security, 
or the social or economic system, of the peo-
ple on Taiwan’’. 
(3) Taiwan is a free, democratic, and pros-
perous nation of 23,000,000 people and an im-
portant contributor to peace and stability 
around the world. 
(4) Since the election of President Tsai 
Ing-wen as President of Taiwan in 2016, the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China has intensified its efforts to pressure 
Taiwan. 
(5) Since 2016, the Gambia, Sao Tome and 
Principe, Panama, the Dominican Republic, 
Burkina Faso, El Salvador, the Solomon Is-
lands, and Kiribati have severed diplomatic 
relations with Taiwan in favor of diplomatic 
relations with China. 
(6) Taiwan currently maintains full diplo-
matic relations with 15 nations around the 
world. 
(7) Taiwan’s unique relationship with the 
United States, Australia, India, Japan, and 
other countries are of significant benefit in 
strengthening Taiwan’s economy and pre-
serving its international space. 
(8) According to President Tsai Ing-wen, 
the severance of diplomatic ties with Taiwan 
in favor of diplomatic relations with China is 
‘‘part of a series of diplomatic and military 
acts of coercion’’ by China. 
(9) The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–409) states that— 
(A) it is United States policy ‘‘to support 
the close economic, political, and security 
relationship between Taiwan and the United 
States’’; and 
(B) the President should— 
(i) ‘‘conduct regular transfers of defense ar-
ticles to Taiwan that are tailored to meet 
the existing and likely future threats from 
the People’s Republic of China, including 
supporting the efforts of Taiwan to develop 
and integrate asymmetric capabilities, as 
appropriate, including mobile, survivable, 
and cost-effective capabilities, into its mili-
tary forces’’; and 
(ii) ‘‘encourage the travel of high-level 
United States officials to Taiwan, in accord-
ance with the Taiwan Travel Act’’. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TRADE AND 
ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH TAI-
WAN. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the United States and Taiwan have 
built a strong economic partnership, with 
the United States now Taiwan’s second larg-
est trading partner and with Taiwan the 11th 
largest trading partner of the United States 
and a key destination for United States agri-
cultural exports; 
(2) strong United States-Taiwan economic 
relations have been a positive factor in stim-
ulating economic growth and job creation for 
the people of both the United States and Tai-
wan; and 
(3) the United States Trade Representative 
should consult with Congress on opportuni-
ties for further strengthening bilateral trade 
and economic relations between the United 
States and Taiwan. 
SEC. 4. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES WITH RE-
GARD TO TAIWAN’S PARTICIPATION 
IN 
INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANIZA-
TIONS. 
It should be the policy of the United 
States— 
(1) to advocate, as appropriate— 
(A) for Taiwan’s membership in all inter-
national organizations in which statehood is 
not a requirement and in which the United 
States is also a participant; and 
(B) for Taiwan to be granted observer sta-
tus in other appropriate international orga-
nizations; 
(2) to instruct, as appropriate, representa-
tives of the United States Government in all 
organizations described in paragraph (1) to 
use the voice, vote, and influence of the 
United States to advocate for Taiwan’s mem-
bership or observer status in such organiza-
tions; and 
(3) for the President or the President’s des-
ignees to advocate, as appropriate, for Tai-
wan’s membership or observer status in all

organizations described in paragraph (1) as 
part of any relevant bilateral engagements 
between the United States and the People’s 
Republic of China, including leader summits 
and the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic 
Dialogue. 
SEC. 5. STRENGTHENING OF TIES WITH TAIWAN. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the United States Government 
should— 
(1) support Taiwan in strengthening its of-
ficial diplomatic relationships as well as 
other partnerships with countries in the 
Indo-Pacific region and around the world; 
(2) consider, in certain cases as appropriate 
and in alignment with United States inter-
ests, increasing its economic, security, and 
diplomatic engagement with nations that 
have demonstrably strengthened, enhanced, 
or upgraded relations with Taiwan; and 
(3) consider, in certain cases as appro-
priate, in alignment with United States for-
eign policy interests and in consultation 
with Congress, altering its economic, secu-
rity, and diplomatic engagement with na-
tions that take serious or significant actions 
to undermine the security or prosperity of 
Taiwan. 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 1 year after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, and 
annually thereafter for five years, the Sec-
retary of State shall report to the appro-
priate congressional committees on the steps 
taken in accordance with subsection (a). 
(c) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES
DEFINED.—In this section, the term 
‘‘appropriate 
congressional 
committees’’ 
means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations, 
the Committee on Appropriations, and the 
Committee on Finance of the Senate; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the 
Committee on Appropriations, and the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means of the House of 
Representatives. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) and the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 1678. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
United 
States 
shares a special relationship with Tai-
wan, rooted in a wide range of shared 
values. Yes, Taiwan is a vibrant democ-
racy. That is the core of our friendship. 
At the same time, Taiwan is a model 
global citizen, making extraordinary 
contributions to global health, avia-
tion safety, and other areas aimed at 
improving people’s lives. It is this spir-
it of generosity and commitment to 
building a safer, more stable world that 
makes Taiwan such a valuable partner. 
This stands in sharp relief to the 
record of the People’s Republic of 
China. It is a comparison the Chinese 
Government doesn’t seem to like, 
based on the PRC’s constant attempt 
to restrict Taiwan’s ability to operate 
on the global stage, including efforts 
by Beijing to poach Taiwan’s diplo-
matic partners. 
The Chinese Government is a bully. 
They want to try to isolate Taiwan, 
and their tactics shouldn’t go unan-
swered. 
This bill, the TAIPEI Act, would help 
us provide a part of that answer. It 
calls on the administration to examine 
our policies toward countries that take 
steps that undermine Taiwan. It calls 
on the administration to take addi-
tional steps to ensure that Taiwan can 
participate in international organiza-
tions, and supports Taiwan’s efforts to 
build stronger partnerships with other 
countries around the world. 
However, perhaps the most impor-
tant thing that we can do for Taiwan is 
to push the U.S. Trade Representative 
to look for new ways to ramp up bilat-
eral trade and economic ties with Tai-
wan. Giving Taiwan economic alter-
natives will be critical for Taiwan’s 
economic future and will benefit the 
United States. 
This is good legislation, and it sends 
a strong and important message to our 
friends in Taiwan and to the Chinese 
Government. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to support 
this measure, and I reserve the balance 
of my time.

Hon. RICHARD E. NEAL,

House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NEAL: I am writing to you

letters is included in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill. 
Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely,

Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support 
my bill, the TAIPEI Act, which does 
three important things. 
First, it endorses a U.S.-Taiwan free 
trade agreement. 
Second, it supports Taiwan’s mem-
bership in international institutions. 
Third, finally, this bill helps Taiwan 
maintain partners and allies around 
the world. 
Mr. Speaker, when I was a young 
missionary living in Taiwan in 1979, I 
could hardly imagine that the day 
would come when I could stand here 
and help return the favor of 40 years 
ago of their friendship and kindness to 
me as a young man living amongst 
them. My time in the region gave me a 
unique understanding of the history 
and the culture of these great people. 
The TAIPEI Act strengthens our re-
lationship with our partner, Taiwan, 
and it does this without spending a sin-
gle U.S. tax dollar. 
I thank Senator GARDNER, the Senate 
sponsor, for working with me on this 
bill, as well as the bipartisan group of 
47 Representatives who cosponsored 
this important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I again 
thank my colleagues for their support 
on the TAIPEI Act. It will make a pow-
erful statement for us to pass this bill, 
and I urge all of my colleagues to sup-
port this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, when China works to 
intimidate and isolate a partner of the 
United States, one that shares our val-
ues, our commitment to democracy, 
our vision for engagement around, we 
should stand by our partner’s side. 
That is what American leadership is 
supposed to look like. 
That is exactly what we see hap-
pening with Taiwan, and if we really 
support the U.S.-Taiwan partnership, 
we need to help our partner get out

would help to do that and would send a 
clear signal of the importance we place 
on the U.S.-China relationship. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this bill so we can send it to 
the President’s desk, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 1678, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, on that

EXPRESSING 
SENSE 
OF 
HOUSE 
THAT THE UNITED STATES CON-
DEMNS 
ALL 
FORMS 
OF 
VIO-
LENCE 
AGAINST 
CHILDREN 
GLOBALLY 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 230) expressing the 
sense of the House of Representatives 
that the United States condemns all 
forms of violence against children glob-
ally and recognizes the harmful im-
pacts of violence against children, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 230 
Expressing the sense of the House of Rep-
resentatives that the United States con-
demns all forms of violence against children 
globally and recognizes the harmful impacts 
of violence against children. 
Whereas violence against children can take 
many forms, including sexual violence, phys-
ical violence, emotional violence, abuse, ne-
glect, and exploitation; 
Whereas, each year, more than 1,000,000,000 
children worldwide are exposed to violence; 
Whereas, each year, the global economic 
impact of physical, psychological, and sexual 
violence against children is estimated to be 
as high as $7,000,000,000,000, which is 8 per-
cent of global gross domestic product (‘‘glob-
al GDP’’); 
Whereas, around the world, an estimated 1 
in 3 adolescent girls between 15 and 19 years 
of age, or 84,000,000 girls, have been victims 
of emotional, physical, or sexual violence, 
which is often perpetrated by individuals the 
girls know; 
Whereas 1 in 5 girls in the developing world 
is said to be married before reaching 18 years 
of age and, of those girls, an estimated 1 in 
9 is said to be married before reaching 15 
years of age; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (‘‘UNICEF’’), if current child 
marriage rates continue, 120,000,000 girls, an 
average of 12,000,000 girls a year, will be mar-
ried before their 18th birthday over the next 
decade; 
Whereas 246,000,000 boys and girls experi-
ence school-related, gender-based violence 
each year; 
Whereas children with disabilities report-
edly are 3 to 4 times more likely to experi-
ence physical or sexual violence; 
Whereas the tens of millions of children 
living outside of family care, including those 
living on the streets, working away from 
home, or in residential care, are particularly 
vulnerable to violence and abuse; 
Whereas an estimated 152,000,000 children 
are involved in child labor and 4,300,000 chil-
dren are subject to forced labor, including in 
situations of trafficking; 
Whereas nearly half of the 68,500,000 indi-
viduals who are currently displaced by con-
flict and war around the world are children, 
and displacement exposes those children to 
increased risk of exploitation, violence, and 
abuse; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations, 
from 2016 to 2017, verified cases of child re-
cruitment, including forcible recruitment, 
and child participation in armed conflict— 
(1) quadrupled in the Central African Re-
public; 
(2) doubled in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo; and 
(3) persisted at alarming levels in Somalia, 
South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, and 
Yemen; 
Whereas more than 10,000 children were 
killed or maimed in 2017 in armed conflict; 
Whereas the risks of online abuse and ex-
ploitation of children is constantly growing, 
with the National Center for Missing and Ex-
ploited Children reviewing cases involving 
25,000,000 child sexual abuse images in 2015, 
up from 450,000 in 2004; 
Whereas unaddressed exposure to violence 
disrupts the development of critical brain ar-
chitecture and other organ structures, leav-
ing children at lifelong risk of disease and 
reduced potential; 
Whereas studies show toxic stress relating 
to exposure to violent or dangerous environ-
ments becomes damaging to learning, behav-
ior, and health across a lifespan; 
Whereas violence against children can lead 
to negative health consequences, including 
injury, noncommunicable and communicable 
diseases, and poor maternal and child health 
outcomes; 
Whereas all forms of violence in childhood 
have a significant negative impact on edu-
cational outcomes, including by reducing 
school attendance and increasing dropout 
rates, and can further limit access to the 
physical, mental health, psychosocial, and 
cognitive protections that safe educational 
settings provide; 
Whereas decades of behavioral and social 
science research have demonstrated that 
building adaptive capacities, known as resil-
ience, through stable and committed rela-
tionships with a supportive caregiver or 
other adult can lessen the harmful develop-
mental effects of violence in children and 
youth; 
Whereas, according to the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development, 
the United States invests 0.5 percent of offi-
cial development assistance in programs 
that are designed to prevent and address vio-
lence against children and youth; 
Whereas the United States, in coordination 
with public-private partnerships and other 
organizations, has endorsed the technical 
package called ‘‘INSPIRE: Seven Strategies 
for Ending Violence against Children’’ (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘INSPIRE’’) 
put forth by the World Health Organization 
with substantial technical input from the 
United States Government, including from 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion and United States Agency for Inter-
national Development; 
Whereas INSPIRE contains 7 evidence- 
based strategies to end violence against chil-
dren that include— 
(1) implementing and enforcing relevant 
laws; 
(2) addressing harmful gender and other so-
cial norms; 
(3) creating and sustaining safe commu-
nities; 
(4) supporting parents and caregivers; 
(5) improving household economic security 
to reduce violence in the home; 
(6) improving access to health services, so-
cial welfare, and criminal justice support; 
and 
(7) ensuring safe school environments that 
provide gender-equitable education and so-
cial-emotional learning and life skills train-
ing; and 
Whereas the United States Agency for 
International Development, the Department 
of State, the Department of Labor, the De-
partment of Homeland Security, and the De-
partment of Health and Human Services 
each play a critical role in preventing and 
responding to violence against children and 
youth: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House 
of Representatives that the United States— 
(1) condemns all forms of violence against 
children and youth globally, including phys-
ical, mental, and sexual violence, neglect, 
abuse, maltreatment, and exploitation; and 
(2) should— 
(A) develop and implement a comprehen-
sive and coordinated strategy built on evi-
dence-based practices, including the tech-
nical package called ‘‘INSPIRE: Seven Strat-
egies for Ending Violence against Children’’ 
put forth by the World Health Organization; 
and 
(B) adopt common metrics and indicators 
to monitor progress across Federal agencies 
to prevent, address, and end violence against 
children and youth globally, including harm-
ful impacts of violence on the healthy devel-
opment of children and the harmful eco-
nomic impact of violence against children 
and youth globally. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) and the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
230. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this measure, and I thank the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MCGOVERN), my colleague, for his hard 
work in bringing this resolution for-
ward. 
More than a billion children world-
wide are exposed to violence each year. 
This can take the form of sexual vio-
lence, physical violence, abuse, ne-
glect, 
and 
exploitation. 
Adolescent 
girls 
are 
an 
especially 
vulnerable 
group. One in three girls between the 
ages of 15 and 17 experience violent 
acts and are often the victims of some-
one they know. Children with disabil-
ities are reportedly three to four times

likelier to experience physical or sex-
ual abuse. 
This violence has a lifetime impact 
on the health and well-being of a grow-
ing child and on their community. 
Children who experience violence have 
higher rates of anxiety and depression 
and are at greater risk of suicide. 
These traumatic events have a lasting 
impact, 
from 
reduced 
neurological 
functions, to poorer educational out-
comes, to higher rates of early and 
child marriage. 
Children should feel safe at home, in 
school, and in their communities. But 
it is in these places that most violence 
against children occurs, often at the 
hands of people they see every day. 
These abuses shape their lives forever. 
Violence against children can be pre-
vented. 
Implementing 
appropriate 
laws, reinforcing positive norms and 
values, creating safe environments, and 
providing support to children and their 
caregivers can help to address the risk 
of violence perpetrated against chil-
dren. 
This resolution puts the House on 
record, saying the United States con-
demns all forms of violence—including 
physical, mental, and sexual violence— 
against children. 
In addition, the resolution urges the 
United States to adopt evidence-based 
strategies to combat violence against 
children as part of the World Health 
Organization’s INSPIRE program, and 
it urges the administration to develop 
indicators and evaluation tools to mon-
itor violence against young people 
globally across Federal agencies. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a good measure. I 
am glad to support it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND 
LABOR, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, February 28, 2020. 
Hon. ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN ENGEL: I write concerning 
H. Res. 230, Expressing the sense of the 
House of Representatives that the United 
States condemns all forms of violence 
against children globally and recognizes the 
harmful impacts of violence against chil-
dren. This resolution was primarily referred 
to the Committee on Education and Labor, 
and additionally to the Committees on For-
eign Affairs. As a result of Leadership and 
Foreign Affairs having consulted with me 
concerning this bill generally, I agree to 
forgo formal consideration of the bill so the 
bill may proceed expeditiously to the House 
floor. 
The Committee on Education and Labor 
takes this action with our mutual under-
standing that by forgoing formal consider-
ation of H. Res. 230, we do not waive any ju-
risdiction over the subject matter contained 
in this or similar legislation, and we will be 
appropriately consulted and involved as the 
resolution or similar legislation moves for-
ward so we may address any remaining issue 
within our Rule X jurisdiction. I also request 
that you support my request to name mem-
bers of the Committee on Education and 
Labor to any conference committee to con-
sider such provisions. 
Finally, I would appreciate a response con-
firming this understanding and ask that a 
copy of our exchange of letters on this mat-
ter be included in the committee report for 
H. Res. 230 and in the Congressional Record 
during floor consideration thereof. 
Very truly yours,

Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
Washington, DC, February 28, 2020. 
Hon. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Committee on Education and Labor, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT: I am writing to you 
concerning H. Res. 230, Expressing the sense 
of the House of Representatives that the 
United States condemns all forms of violence 
against children globally and recognizes the 
harmful impacts of violence against chil-
dren. I appreciate your willingness to work 
cooperatively on this legislation. 
I acknowledge that provisions of the bill 
fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Education and Labor under House Rule X, 
and that your Committee will forgo action 
on H. Res. 230, to expedite floor consider-
ation. I further acknowledge that the inac-
tion of your Committee with respect to the 
bill does not waive any future jurisdictional 
claim over the matters contained in the bill 
that fall within your jurisdiction. I will also 
support the appointment of Committee on 
Education and Labor conferees during any 
House-Senate conference convened on this 
legislation. 
Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of 
letters is included in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD

regarding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of this resolution to condemn all forms 
of violence against children around the 
world. I thank my colleagues, Con-
gressman MCGOVERN and Congressman 
WILSON, for introducing this resolution 
and for their work to address this very 
important issue. 
Mr. Speaker, more than 1 billion chil-
dren around the world are victims of 
violence each year. Violence, exploi-
tation, and abuse take many forms and 
disproportionately affect children in 
the most vulnerable populations, in-
cluding those in refugee settlements 
and conflict zones. 
These traumatic experiences have se-
rious and long-lasting effects on chil-
dren’s psychological, physical, and so-
cial development. But the negative 
consequences of violence against chil-
dren spread far beyond individuals and 
families. When children are prevented 
from reaching their full potential, na-
tions suffer severe political and eco-
nomic setbacks. 
The United States has been a global 
leader in prioritizing programs to sup-
port the health and well-being of chil-
dren around the world through our for-
eign assistance programs, but we can 
always do more. 
This resolution encourages the devel-
opment of a coordinated and evidence- 
based U.S. strategy to prevent, address, 
and end this abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), my friend, 
the author of this important resolu-
tion, a champion of human rights, and 
the co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human 
Rights Commission. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding me 
the time and for his leadership on pro-
grams that protect and address the 
needs of vulnerable children here at 
home and around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to be 
the author of this bipartisan resolu-
tion, along with Congressman JOE WIL-
SON. And I am very proud of the 62 bi-
partisan cosponsors on this bill who 
represent the geographic and ideolog-
ical diversity of this House. 
I also thank the broad coalition of 
organizations that have worked so long 
in support of this resolution, in par-
ticular, ChildFund, Save the Children, 
World Vision, Futures Without Vio-
lence, and UNICEF USA. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter supporting this resolution from 
these groups and others.

Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, U.S. House of Represent-
atives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. STENY HOYER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MAJORITY LEADER 
HOYER, AND MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY: As 
organizations committed to the protection 
and health of children around the globe, we 
kindly request that the House of Representa-
tives approve on suspension of the rules H. 
Res. 230, a Congressional Resolution to End 
Violence Against Children Globally. Our 
community is proud of the strong bipartisan 
support that H. Res. 230 has received in Con-
gress since it was introduced by Congress-
man Jim McGovern (D–MA) and Congress-
man Joe Wilson (R–SC) on March 14, 2019. It 
is currently cosponsored by a bipartisan 
group of more than 60 Members of Congress 
and was previously approved by the House 
Committee on Foreign Affairs on October 30, 
2019. 
Half of all children—one billion—are vic-
tims of violence each year and every five 
minutes, a child dies as a result. Forms of vi-
olence include, but are not limited to, 
human trafficking, child marriage, child 
labor, homicide, and online exploitation and 
sexual abuse. Early exposure to violence can 
impair children’s brain development and 
damage their circulatory, reproductive, and 
immune systems, causing life-long risk of 
disease and reduced potential. The global 
economic cost of violence against children 
has been measured to be as high as $7 trillion 
dollars or 8% of the world’s GDP annually. 
Fortunately, the United States Govern-
ment is uniquely positioned to drive efforts 
to prevent and respond to violence against 
children. Federal government agencies like 
USAID, the State Department and the De-
partment of Labor are already hard at work 
serving the world’s children. However, these 
efforts are done without optimal coordina-
tion between agencies or an overarching, 
government-wide strategy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1456 
March 3, 2020 
The Congressional Resolution to End Vio-
lence Against Children Globally (H. Res. 230/ 
S. Res. 112) recognizes the harmful impacts 
of violence and calls upon Congress to de-
velop and implement a coordinated strategy 
based on proven practices. The resolution 
highlights the INSPIRE framework—seven 
key evidence-based strategies to end vio-
lence against children. INSPIRE, developed 
in collaboration with the CDC, USAID, and 
others, provides common metrics and indica-
tors 
which 
can 
measure 
and 
monitor 
progress. 
Over the years, the U.S. Government has 
demonstrated its commitment to the health 
and well-being of children. Providing safety 
and security for vulnerable children supports 
U.S. efforts to address violence and mitigate 
its impacts, therein bolstering other anti- 
poverty international development efforts, 
including education, health, and economic 
well-being. Building upon the work of the 
U.S. Government’s Strategy on Advancing 
Protection and Care for Children in Adver-
sity, passage of H. Res. 230 would enhance ex-
isting government efforts to address perva-
sive violence against children. 
We thank you in advance for your consid-
eration of H. Res. 230. We urge you to sup-
port these one billion children and support 
passage of this important resolution. 
Sincerely, 
American 
Academy

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, even 
though we have made great strides in 
identifying and addressing much of the 
violence 
that 
affects 
children 
and 
young people around the world, the sad 
reality is that violence against chil-
dren is still pandemic. 
Every 5 minutes, a child dies of vio-
lence. Half of all children—1 billion— 
are victims of violence. Homicide is 
among the top causes of death in ado-
lescents. 
That is not just a shame, Mr. Speak-
er. That is absolutely unacceptable. 
Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of those 
homicide victims are boys, and nearly 
one in five girls is sexually abused at 
least once in her life. 
Mr. Speaker, sadly, violence can hap-
pen 
anywhere—in 
communities, 
in 
schools, in the home, in emergency and 
crisis situations, in churches, on the 
streets, online, and on the phone. It 
happens in the most idyllic-seeming 
neighborhood and in the midst of con-
flict and war. 
Violence takes many forms: human 
trafficking, child marriage, child labor, 
murder, 
assault, 
beatings, 
psycho-
logical abuse, and online exploitation. 
And too much of the violence is based 
on gender. 
We know that children who are ex-
posed to violence at a very young age 
can be affected for life. Violence can 
impair brain development. It could 
damage the circulatory and immune 
systems. 
Such violence can cause lifelong 
risks of being vulnerable to disease, ill-
ness, and disabilities. It can harm the 
ability to reproduce and engage in a 
full sexual life. It can severely affect 
the ability of a child to live up to their 
full potential. 
Luckily, 
nations, 
healthcare 
pro-
viders, 
teachers, 
communities, 
and 
nongovernmental groups have come to-
gether to end violence against chil-
dren. They have identified and agreed 
upon some solutions to ending violence 
against children. 
We in this House should be proud 
that the CDC, USAID, World Health 
Organization, and others have devel-
oped what is called the INSPIRE pack-
age, which is a set of strategies to re-
duce and end violence against children 
everywhere. 
So many of us in this Chamber are 
parents. I am the father of a son and a 
daughter. I know how we worry about 
our children’s safety and well-being. 
This is true of all families everywhere. 
In many ways, each and every child is 
our child. We need to be concerned 
about their vulnerability, about their 
safety, about their care, and about 
their protection. 
This resolution announces to the 
world that we are aware; that we do 
care; and, more importantly, that we 
want our health and aid agencies to 
take action. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this resolution, and 
I thank my colleagues for their sup-
port. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, in closing, 
I again thank my colleagues for their 
hard work on this important cause. 
The exploitation, violence, and abuse 
experienced by so many of the world’s 
most vulnerable children cannot be tol-
erated. This resolution raises aware-
ness of this horrific reality and urges 
the United States Government to de-
velop and coordinate evidence-based 
strategies to address this issue. 
The United States must continue to 
use its influence on the global stage to 
end violence against children wherever 
it exists. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I again thank Congress-
man MCGOVERN for his hard work on 
this measure. He has been a tireless ad-
vocate for children and protecting chil-
dren around the world. 
American leadership on this issue is 
absolutely vital. Ensuring the safety of 
our children today safeguards the fu-

HONORING DENISE WILKERSON 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor a great public servant from my 
district, Denise Wilkerson. 
Ms. Wilkerson is the council presi-
dent for the city of Roselle, New Jer-
sey, but her dedication to her commu-
nity extends far beyond her city coun-
cil work. She also is the president of 
the Union County National Organiza-
tion for Women. She served as second 
vice president of the National Council 
of Negro Women in Roselle, as well. 
She is actively involved in her local 
NAACP chapter, and, in addition, she 
is the executive director of Abounding 
Women Community Outreach. This 
nonprofit is dedicated to empowering 
women 
through 
their 
community 
events and professional skills training. 
She is a vibrant part of my commu-
nity, and I am glad to commend her 
from the floor of the United States 
House of Representatives on this day. 
She deserves all the accolades we can 
give her and much more.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF SAMI 
NATOUR 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember the life of Sami 
Natour, a respected member of the 
Knoxville community who recently 
passed away at the age of 86. 
Sami lived the American Dream. He 
was born in Palestine in 1933 and later 
immigrated to America in 1953. He re-
turned to Palestine in 1956 to marry his 
wife, Abla, before they permanently 
settled in the United States and be-
came American citizens. The Natours 
lived in Arlington, Virginia, before 
making east Tennessee their home. 
In 1972, Sami opened the Copper Ket-
tle Restaurant in Knoxville with his 
brothers, Samir and Naji. Sami worked 
extremely hard to make the Copper 
Kettle a success. Sami’s son, Peter, re-
members his father’s work ethic and 
how he would often work from 6 in the 
morning until midnight. 
Sami’s dedication to his business 
clearly left an impression on his sons: 
all three of them own and operate res-
taurants in the Knoxville area. Peter 
runs Pete’s Coffee Shop—one of my fa-
vorite places—Basel runs Rami’s Cafe, 
and Bassam runs Sami’s Cafe. 
Sami will be greatly missed. His life 
story serves as a reminder that anyone 
willing to work hard can follow their 
dreams and be successful in our great 
Nation. 
f 
OPPOSING TEXAS’ MEDICAID 
WAIVER PROGRAM 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
am here today to oppose the Healthy 
Texas Women Medicaid waiver pro-
gram, which is nothing more than a 
reckless attack on reproductive rights. 
The ironically titled Healthy Texas 
Women program blocks Medicaid bene-
ficiaries from getting care at providers 
that 
offer 
abortion 
services, 
like 
Planned Parenthood. This does nothing 
to expand access to family planning 
care. It will harm low-income women 
who 
rely 
on 
Medicaid 
for 
their 
healthcare. 
When Texas excluded Planned Par-
enthood from State funding 7 years 
ago, 45,000 fewer women accessed care. 
We cannot stand for that. This waiver 
program will hurt women of color the 
most, who already experience health 
disparities and barriers to access. 
Mr. Speaker, I will not stop fighting 
to protect a woman’s right to make her 
own decisions about her healthcare, 
and I urge the Congress to do the same. 
f 
RECOGNIZING HEAD COACH 
ULYSSES HAWTHORNE 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Alfred E. 
Beach 
High 
School 
Head 
Football 
Coach, Ulysses Hawthorne, who is re-
tiring from the Savannah-Chatham 
County Public Schools system after 21 
seasons. 
Coach Hawthorne is a stalwart in the 
Savannah athletics scene. At the time 
of his retirement he was the dean of all 
the coaches in the area, but, most im-
portantly, he has always been an ex-
ceptional role model to his players. 
Players he coached remember that he 
pushed them to become leaders on and 
off the field. Many of his players are 
now playing at the next level in col-
lege. 
As a unit, his teams were successful 
against schools from across the State 
of Georgia. In 2011, Coach Hawthorne 
took Alfred E. Beach High School to its 
first appearance in the State playoffs 
since 1993. During his tenure at Beach, 
he accumulated 76 wins. 
I am so proud to have someone like 
Coach Hawthorne in the First Congres-
sional District of Georgia shaping the 
lives of young people. 
f 
SPECIAL OLYMPICS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight 
the great work of the Special Olym-
pics. 
Recently, I had the pleasure of vis-
iting with Special Olympics athletes 
from Souderton Area High School, a 
Unified Sports school. 
Schools that participate in Unified 
Sports pair students with and without 
disabilities 
to 
promote 
inclusion 
through a shared love of sports. Ath-
lete Kevin Lezynski and his unified 
partner Jon Booz stopped by my office 
recently to share their experiences 
with the Pennsylvania Special Olym-
pics. 
The Special Olympics is a fantastic 
organization representing more than 5 
million athletes that teaches the value 
of good sportsmanship. Because of the 
Special Olympics, individuals with in-
tellectual disabilities are given oppor-
tunities to not only strengthen their 
physical fitness, but to strengthen the 
lifelong friendships made with fellow 
athletes along the way. 
I would like to wish Kevin and Jon 
the best of luck in their future com-
petitions, and to all of the other brave

STATE OF FLORIDA’S BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the great State of 
Florida. 
On this day in 1845, Florida became 
the 27th State to join our Union and 
has had a strong impact on our Nation 
ever since. 
From producing 70 percent of our Na-
tion’s citrus, to ranking number 2 in 
vegetables harvested, Florida, as an ag-
ricultural powerhouse, has long been 
critical in feeding hungry Americans. 
Our State’s importance to our national 
security also can’t be understated. 
Florida is home to 3 of 11 unified 
combatant commands—Central Com-
mand, Southern Command, and Special 
Operations Command. I am so honored 
to represent a district home to 57,000 
veterans, part of the 1.5 million who 
call the Sunshine State home. 
Florida is also a major tourism des-
tination as millions from around the 
world flock to our shores to enjoy our 
beaches, 
food, 
culture, 
and 
theme 
parks. 
I am grateful to have been born and 
raised in Florida and to represent the 
15th District. I look forward to work-
ing with the Florida delegation to con-
tinue bettering the lives of all our 
State residents for generations to 
come. 
f 
THE BACHARACH GIANTS OF 
ATLANTIC CITY 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 4104, the Negro 
Leagues 
Baseball 
Centennial 
Com-
memorative Coin Act. 
In New Jersey’s Second District we 
were home to the Bacharach Giants in 
Atlantic City. The team was a top con-
tender in the league and won two pen-
nants in 1926 and 1927. 
The Giants were lucky enough to 
host players such as John Henry ‘‘Pop’’ 
Lloyd, a player whom Babe Ruth him-
self once called the greatest ballplayer 
of all time, anywhere, ever. 
Pop Lloyd would end up retiring and 
coaching youth baseball in Atlantic 
City until the day he died, and he was 
inducted into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1977. 
Players like Pop Lloyd would lay the 
foundation for future stars such as 
Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron, who 
would change the game forever. Yet, 
players like Lloyd, and the leagues 
they played in, are slowly becoming 
forgotten to the annals of history. 
We cannot let that happen. I thank 
the gentleman from Missouri for intro-
ducing this important legislation to 
commemorate and honor those players 
and the role they played in shaping 
America’s very favorite pastime. 
May God bless him. 
f 
SOCIAL SECURITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. LARSON) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to address the 
Chamber about one of the most impor-
tant issues that the Nation faces, and 
that issue has only been underscored 
by the issue of the coronavirus, and 
also by the issue of inequality that ex-
ists today in this great country of ours, 
the wealthiest nation in the history of 
the world. 
I am pleased to announce the number 
of people who have risen and come to 
support Social Security 2100. It is 
called Social Security 2100 because we 
address the needs of Social Security 
into the next century so that Social 
Security will be solvent beyond 75 
years and address the vital concerns of 
each and every American. 
In 2019, 64 million Americans received 
Social Security benefits totaling over 
$1 trillion. For nearly one-third of our 
elderly beneficiaries, Social Security 
benefits are 90 percent of their total in-
come. Two-thirds rely on Social Secu-
rity for the majority of their income. 
The average benefit in 2019 per Amer-
ican was $17,600 for retired workers, 
and that works out to be about $18,000 
for men and $14,000 for women—not 
enough for most to live on. 
Mr. Speaker, 178 million Americans 
are covered by Social Security today; 
10,000, baby boomers a day become eli-
gible for Social Security. 
Social Security helps lower and mid-
dle-income Americans the most. More 
than 90 percent of benefits go to bene-
ficiaries earning less than $50,000. Let 
me repeat that again: more than 90 per-
cent of all the benefits of Social Secu-
rity go to people earning less than 
$50,000 a year. 
That is why the following individuals 
have supported the Social Security 2100 
Act, including: Social Security Works, 
the National Committee to Preserve 
Social Security and Medicare, the 
AFL–CIO, the Alliance for Retired 
Americans, 
Paralyzed 
Veterans 
of 
America, VoteVets, the American Fed-
eration of Government Employees, the 
National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People, Latinos for a 
Secure Retirement, the National Orga-
nization for Women, SAGE, the Na-
tional Education Association, The Arc 
of the United States, International 
Federation of Professional & Technical 
Engineers representing the Adminis-
trative Law Judges, Consortium for 
Citizens With Disabilities Social Secu-
rity Task Force, Justice in Aging, the 
Association of University Centers on 
Disabilities, Senior Citizens League, 
the National Organization of Social Se-
curity Claimants’ Representatives, the 
EPI Policy Center, the National Re-
tiree Legislative Network, Public Cit-
izen, CREDO Action, Progress Amer-
ica, Other 98, the Daily Kos, People’s 
Action, the Diverse Elders Coalition, 
the National Employment Law Project, 
Freedom to Prosper, MoveOn, Union 
Veterans Council of the AFL–CIO, just 
to name a few, Madam Speaker. 
I want to start today by talking 
about having Secretary Mnuchin before 
the Ways and Means Committee this 
morning. 
I reminded Secretary Mnuchin and 
complimented the President for saying 
in his last two State of the Union mes-
sages how he was committed to pro-
tecting Social Security. While he is 
committed to protecting Social Secu-
rity, his budgets have not reflected 
that, which was a point of concern we 
raised with Secretary Mnuchin espe-
cially since—to give President Trump 
credit here—that during the campaign 
of 2016 when faced with 16 other Repub-
licans who tried to force him to say 
that Social Security is an entitlement, 
President Trump, to his credit, said: 
No, Social Security is an earned ben-
efit. 
I asked Secretary Mnuchin if he be-
lieved that Social Security was an 
earned benefit, and he said: Yes, it was. 
I also asked then, if that is the case, 
and it is an earned benefit, it debunks 
a longstanding concern raised by the 
other side that Social Security is 
somehow 
an 
entitlement 
program 
when, in fact, every American citizen 
knows, because of FICA, exactly what 
Social Security is. 
FICA stands for the Federal Insur-
ance Contribution Act, but anyone can 
go to their pay stub and look at it. 
Federal Insurance Contribution—whose 
contribution? 
Your contribution; every American 
citizen’s contribution. It is not a tax. 
The tax that is paid by an employer to 
your benefit is fully deductible. The 
employer gets to deduct it. The benefit 
for your contribution goes directly to 
the employee, and they get that in the 
way of pension guarantee, disability 
protection, spousal and dependent cov-
erage, and a death benefit. 
b 1430 
The wisdom of Franklin Delano Roo-
sevelt is also prescient because they re-
alized back in 1929, after the Great De-
pression, in this great capitalistic and 
entrepreneurial society that we live in, 
that sometimes, through no fault of 
your own, when something as disas-
trous as a stock market crash or an un-
anticipated virus takes place, that dis-
aster can prevail, and all of a sudden, 
you would find yourself in a situation 
where you had not the means. 
Thus, Congress, because of President 
Roosevelt, adopted the Social Security 
Act and paid for it through the Federal 
insurance contribution. So this con-
tribution, every citizen knows that it 
is their contribution that they make.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1466 
March 3, 2020 
I commended President Trump for 
having said that, debating his other 
Republican opponents. But to date, the 
administration has not produced a plan 
that will protect Social Security, that 
will, in fact, expand Social Security 
the way it needs to be. 
In fact, the last time Social Security 
was expanded, there was a Republican 
President, a Republican Senate, and a 
Democratic House. The Democratic 
Speaker was Tip O’Neill. He led that ef-
fort. The leader of the Social Security 
movement was Robert Dole. The Sen-
ate majority leader was Howard Baker. 
And the President was Ronald Reagan. 
They understood, bipartisanly, that 
this is the American people’s number 
one insurance program, the number 
one antipoverty program. 
You know what? We don’t even have 
to go back to 1929 to understand the 
impact and the need for Social Secu-
rity. History and historians are replete 
with the stories of the great crash. We 
have to go back only as far as 2008 be-
cause, in 2008, this country experienced 
the Great Recession. 
Since that recession, many Ameri-
cans saw their 401(k)’s become 101(k)’s, 
and 90 percent of the American people 
have not recovered their wealth and as-
sets that they lost in the recession of 
2008. Let me repeat that, Madam 
Speaker: 90 percent of Americans have 
not recovered their wealth and assets 
from 2008. 
During that time, when many lost 
everything, 
and 
companies 
turned 
away from defined benefit contribu-
tions and were getting out of the pen-
sion business, during that same time 
period, Social Security never missed a 
payment. Social Security never missed 
a pension payment, never missed a dis-
ability payment, never missed a spous-
al or dependent coverage payment, be-
cause it is the full faith and credit of 
the United States Government and the 
Nation’s number one insurance plan 
and the Nation’s number one anti-
poverty plan. 
Most recently, our dear colleague 
JOHN LEWIS reminded us—and in June 
2019 he rolled out, along with DANNY 
DAVIS, LINDA SA´ NCHEZ, TERRI SEWELL, 
GWEN MOORE, JIMMY GOMEZ, and other 
members of the Committee on Ways 
and Means—the fact that Social Secu-
rity is a civil rights issue as well, a 
civil rights issue that has long gone 
unaddressed. 
It has been more than 37 years since 
Social Security was last fixed, and that 
was under Tip O’Neill, Ronald Reagan, 
and Howard Baker. It has been more 
than 50 years since Social Security was 
enhanced. Do you think things have 
changed for people in 37 years and in 50 
years? 
Every American listening to this un-
derstands that that is the case. They 
have faithfully paid into this earned 
benefit and have gotten, in return, a 
benefit, but one that needs to be 
changed and modified in a way that is 
sustainably solvent into the next cen-
tury and enhanced in the following 
ways that people like DANNY
DAVIS 
have advocated. 
Here are the four ways that we en-
hance Social Security. 
Number one, we make sure that no 
one can retire into poverty. In the 
wealthiest nation in the world today, 
fellow American citizens who have paid 
all their quarters into Social Security, 
who have worked all their lives, re-
ceive a Social Security check that is 
below the poverty level. Most of them 
happen to be women, and most of them 
happen to be women of color. 
It is the shame of this country that 
in the midst of the great prosperity 
and wealth and, frankly, in the midst 
of handing out a $2 trillion tax cut of 
which 83 percent went to the Nation’s 
wealthiest 1 percent, that we could not 
find the will and the way to help out 
those who have worked all their lives 
and paid into the program. 
This is no handout. This is someone 
who, by the sweat of their brow and 
their work, earned a benefit that 
hasn’t actuarially kept pace, because, 
in 1983, they didn’t index it the way 
they should have. No one who has paid 
in their quarters should suffer for a 
mistake made by Congress. 
Congress needs to correct that so 
now the new floor for Social Security 
will become 125 percent of what the 
poverty level is so that no one who 
works their whole life and pays in their 
quarters can retire into poverty. 
The second thing we do is make sure 
that there is a 2 percent across-the- 
board increase. Nobody gets wealthy on 
Social Security. On average, a male 
earns approximately $18,000 in Social 
Security 
payments 
and 
a 
female 
$14,000. Nobody is getting wealthy on 
Social Security. It is the subsistence 
amount of money necessitated to make 
ends meet. So, a modest 2 percent in-
crease will be spent right back into the 
very communities that they live in. 
On average, every congressional dis-
trict has 145,000 people who receive So-
cial Security. In each one of our 435 
districts, 145,000 people will be spending 
money back in those communities. 
Recognize that this is an economic 
stimulus bill. In fact, most recently, 
Jason Furman, coming before the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means, talked 
about this as an economic stimulus, as 
has Larry Summers and other econo-
mists who have taken a look at the 
ways we need to stimulate our econ-
omy 
by 
making 
sure 
that 
those 
amongst us who need the money most 
and who spend that money directly 
back in the community on the neces-
sities of life—like heating and cooling 
their homes, providing the fuel that al-
lows them to operate their auto-
mobiles, making sure that they have 
food and nutrition and physical ther-
apy, and paying for doctor visits and 
also prescriptions—this is what we are 
doing to expand this bill with a 2 per-
cent increase and then also making 
sure that there is a COLA that reflects 
the actual costs that people incur. 
How so? A COLA, which the AARP 
calls CPIE, with ‘‘E’’ standing for el-
derly, but I would also say standing for 
the essential benefits that the elderly 
need. Again, heating and cooling your 
home, prescription drugs, doctor visits, 
physical therapy, the very food that 
you put on your table, these are essen-
tial for life. That is what should go 
into figuring out what your COLA is, 
and that is what this bill reflects. 
The bill also reflects the idea that a 
lot of people continue to work beyond 
retirement age. But most people don’t 
realize that if you are single and mak-
ing more than $24,000, your Social Se-
curity is taxed. If you are a married 
couple and making more than $32,000, 
your Social Security is taxed. Again, 
back in 1983, they didn’t index this. We 
changed that. We indexed Social Secu-
rity. Now, 12 million Americans will 
get a tax break because of that. 
Making sure that no one can retire 
into poverty, having a modest 2 per-
cent across-the-board increase, having 
a COLA that reflects your actual ex-
penses, and providing a tax break is at 
the core of this bill. 
In the new and added improvements 
of the bill, including those led by 
DANNY DAVIS to make sure that grand-
mothers and grandparents, to make 
sure that students, to make sure that 
widows are getting extra money to 
raise the children that they are respon-
sible for was also included in this legis-
lation, as well as introducing an earned 
income tax credit so that nobody earn-
ing $50,000 and below will have to pay 
an increase in taxes and in contribu-
tions, to make sure that the money is 
going where it is needed the most, to 
help people at the lower end of the pay 
scale to get the kind of benefits that 
the Social Security 2100 Act provides. 
b 1445 
And with that, Madam Speaker, I am 
going to yield to the gentleman from 
the great State of Illinois (Mr. DANNY 
K. DAVIS), as I like to refer to him—as 
I have heard no better voice in Con-
gress—the voice of God. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Well, thank you, sir. I want to thank 
you indeed. As a matter of fact, as I 
was listening, I was saying to myself, 
after a good sermon, all that you really 
say is ‘‘Amen.’’ And I want to say 
‘‘Amen’’ to you. 
And I say that in all seriousness, be-
cause the number one advocate for an 
expanded Social Security in this House 
of Representatives is none other than 
Representative JOHN LARSON. I thank 
you for your diligence, for the consist-
ency. 
When you walk in my office, there is 
a photograph of Franklin Delano Roo-
sevelt, and that photograph has been 
there ever since I have been here. I had 
that photograph before I came here, be-
cause the work and the leadership, the 
vision that Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
had, has been transformed and passed 
on to people like yourself and to you. I 
am so proud to be able to say that I 
serve with you in this House of Rep-
resentatives, on the Ways and Means

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1467 
March 3, 2020 
Committee, and that you chair the So-
cial Security Subcommittee and the 
Social Security effort. 
The only other thing that I really 
would need to say and would want to 
say, I have always been told that you 
can measure the effectiveness of a soci-
ety, that you make an assessment by 
how well it treats its young, how well 
it treats its old, and how well it treats 
those who have difficulty caring for 
themselves. 
I couldn’t help but think of my fa-
ther, as I listened to you, who was 92 
years old when he died. But he had a 
good life. As a matter of fact, he spent 
the last 5 years living with me on the 
weekends whenever I came home. 
He always wanted to pay for things. 
You know, we would stop for dinner, 
and he would say to my wife: Vera, I 
am going to treat you for dinner. 
His Social Security check was $500- 
something a month, which obviously 
would not have been enough if he had 
to live alone and care for himself and 
all of that. But I would go ahead and 
let him pay. I would say: Okay. Well, if 
you want to pay for dinner, go right 
ahead—and he would pay. 
When I stopped to get gasoline, as 
the tank was being filled, he would say: 
Here, let me pay for it. 
He would reach and get his money. 
We were getting gas. At the time, gaso-
line was very high. It went up to $40, 
$50, $60, $70. He would say: I guess you 
better go ahead and pay for it. You 
don’t have to worry. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. He is a 
smart man. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
But, again, we have got to expand it. 
We have got to keep it. We have got to 
make sure that it provides for the indi-
viduals it is designed to provide for. 
It is not a gift. It is not a giveaway. 
It is an entitlement that people work 
for. And so I am proud to join with you 
in saying that we have got to make So-
cial Security everything that it ought 
to be. 
Where you lead, I will follow, and we 
will help make it happen. So, thank 
you very much. I am going to conclude, 
and this just about ends my day. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Well, 
first of all, thank you very much. I 
deeply appreciate your efforts, Mr. 
DAVIS. 
And I love the story about your fa-
ther, because that just demonstrates 
the dignity and the worth of a lifetime 
of work. But, still, he wanted to pay, 
he wanted to continue to contribute, 
because he knew how important it was. 
And it wasn’t any handout. He 
worked for it all of his life. He contrib-
uted into it. 
Now we are faced with a decision in 
Congress on our watch, not sometime 
down in the future, but now. 
For you up there listening in the au-
dience, as we speak, this year, Social 
Security will start paying out more 
money than it is taking in. It hasn’t 
been adjusted in 37 years. 
There is nothing that you can leave 
untouched that requires actuarial at-
tention—and, specifically, the atten-
tion of Congress—that, left untouched, 
will continue to flourish. And yet So-
cial Security has never missed a pay-
ment, not for disability, not for spousal 
or dependent coverage, and not for a 
pension. It is America’s insurance plan. 
It is our number one antipoverty pro-
gram as well. 
That is why I am so grateful that 
Danny and others have pointed this out 
as a civil rights issue, as well, because 
of the way, for so long, people of color, 
especially Black males, have been dis-
criminated against. 
Also, when you look at women and 
you understand that, for women of 
color, they are receiving 56 cents for 
every dollar their White male counter-
parts were—80 cents for White women, 
53 cents for Hispanic women—that is 
simply unfair. 
In this day and age, we can correct 
that, and we can do it simply by doing 
what Roosevelt asked us to do: Make a 
contribution. 
What does that contribution go to-
wards? It goes towards a pension, a dis-
ability payment, dependent coverage, 
and a spousal benefit. 
That is a pretty good deal. You can’t 
buy that anywhere in the private sec-
tor. 
I come from one of the insurance cap-
itals of the world, where, when you 
went to insurance school, they taught 
you about the three legs on the stool; 
and the most important leg on that 
stool was Social Security, because that 
was the floor, that was the safety net 
which nothing could fall through. 
We don’t ever want to see another 
crash like 1929. But, again, understand, 
since 2008, 90 percent of Americans are 
struggling because they haven’t recov-
ered their wealth and assets. Sixty- 
eight percent of all millennials, who 
will need Social Security more than 
baby boomers, have only Social Secu-
rity to rely on. They have no pension 
or 401(k). 
While we should do everything to 
make that more possible, the plausible 
reality and what government can do is 
at hand: First and foremost, make So-
cial Security solvent; and then, sec-
ondly, make sure it is solvent for more 
than 75 years and addresses baby 
boomers and millennials and future 
generations, and does so with modest 
benefits that end the inequality that 
exists but also provides basic economic 
sustenance so that our economies can 
thrive. 
Both Jason Furman and Larry Sum-
mers, and, I think, Secretary Mnuchin 
would even agree with this today. They 
were talking about, in the face of the 
coronavirus—which, by the way, is age- 
related and will impact the elderly and 
people in the age groups of 60 to 70 and 
70 to 80 far more than it will impact 
any other generation, and it will do so 
in a way that they better have the 
wherewithal—they were talking about 
means to stimulate the economy. 
The number one way to stimulate the 
economy is to give those modest bene-
fits to the very people—145,000, on aver-
age, in every congressional district—so 
those modest benefits are spent di-
rectly right back into the communities 
that they live in for the necessities of 
life that are needed to sustain their ex-
istence. 
Would you agree, Dan? 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. I 
agree wholeheartedly. 
As a matter of fact, if you really 
want to touch and move the economy, 
it is to make sure that those individ-
uals at the very bottom are able to 
contribute. 
You see, I always say that money to 
a community is like blood to the body. 
No matter how sophisticated we are in 
terms of medicine and health, if all the 
blood leaves your body, in all likeli-
hood, you are going to die. 
In communities that are considered 
low income, senior citizen villages, 
places where people live in senior hous-
ing, unless those individuals have re-
sources to plow back into the environ-
ment, then those will always be low in-
come, no money, no resources, no busi-
ness, no opportunities, no hope. 
So, if we really want to make Amer-
ica be the America that we dream 
about, talk about, hope about, but has 
never been, then Social Security is the 
way to do it. Every person who works, 
who reaches a certain age, you know, 
retirement can be a good thing. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Ex-
actly. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
You have got enough resources to re-
tire without wondering if you are going 
to have to cut your pills in half or not 
pay the light bill or pay the rent or 
have enough money to purchase the 
food that you want, where you are not 
scraping and looking for coupons and 
looking for special sales and special op-
portunities. 
That is what happens to many of our 
senior citizens. They have to look and 
see if there is an item on sale so that 
they will be able to acquire it. So, if we 
make sure that there are sufficient re-
sources for people to live on, then, at 
my church, they would say that you 
are doing the work of the Master. 
So there is no better way to do it, no 
more effective, no more efficient way. I 
am just pleased that we have this op-
portunity to do this, and do it now. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. We do, 
and it is on our watch. 
I can’t emphasize this enough. For 
every Member of Congress and every 
person out there in America who is lis-
tening to C–SPAN right now or to this 
program: It is on our watch. It is our 
responsibility. We cannot continue to 
kick the can down the road. 
Doing nothing means a 20 percent cut 
to people’s benefits. 
Let me repeat that again. Doing 
nothing means a 20 percent cut to peo-
ple’s benefits. 
Now, there are some who are fine 
with that, but most, on both sides of 
the aisle, are not in favor of that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1468 
March 3, 2020 
Here is what the polling data shows. 
It shows that Social Security is bipar-
tisan. Seventy-seven percent of Ameri-
cans—84 percent of Democrats, 69 per-
cent of Republicans, 76 percent of Inde-
pendents—said that they would be will-
ing to pay a little more to make sure 
that their benefits are not cut and that 
they are protected and expanded. 
Also, 91 percent of workers and 94 
percent of retirees would feel be-
trayed—that is 91 percent of workers, 
94 percent of retirees would feel be-
trayed—if the money they paid into 
Social Security was not available to 
them. 
A Gallup poll found, this most recent 
one, 
that 
Social 
Security 
ranked 
fourth amongst the things that keep 
people up at night and worried with re-
spect to their security, fourth in im-
portance after education, healthcare, 
and their financial security—and they 
often lump financial security and So-
cial Security together. 
b 1500 
I would just like to close. 
I mentioned Jason Furman, who was 
the former Obama National Economic 
Council Adviser, and Larry Summers, 
the 
former 
Clinton 
Treasury 
Sec-
retary—both were serving up at Har-
vard—who have written extensively 
about the importance of making sure, 
as an economic stimulus and out of ne-
cessity, that we make the improve-
ments that should have been made 37 
years ago but desperately need to be 
taken up today, not only for current 
generations and baby boomers retiring, 
but for millennials and future genera-
tions. 
Alicia Munnell, the current Director 
for the Center for Retirement Re-
search, former member of the Presi-
dent’s Council of Economic Advisors, 
former Assistant Secretary for Eco-
nomic Policy, and former senior vice 
president at the Federal Reserve in 
Boston, said we have to protect Social 
Security: Policymakers should fix So-
cial Security by raising, incremen-
tally, over time, the money neces-
sitated to do it. It doesn’t come from 
heaven. 
We need to maintain benefits. People 
don’t have anything else other than 
their 401(k)s, and a specific portion of 
the population doesn’t even have those. 
Social Security is the forced savings 
plan that people have paid into and 
have counted on, and, as I have said be-
fore, it has never missed a payment. 
Monique Morrissey, economist from 
the Economic Policy Institute: ‘‘Ex-
panding Social Security . . . ensures 
steady contributions; it keeps costs 
low and prevents leakage; and it pools 
longevity risk. Moreover, Social Secu-
rity’s pay-as-you-go financing . . . pro-
vides an internal rate of return tied to 
economic growth . . . but without the 
gyrations.’’ 
Dean Baker, senior economist for the 
Center for Economic and Policy Re-
search, if Social Security 2100 becomes 
law, ‘‘it would both improve the pro-
gram’s benefit structure and its finan-
cial picture. . . . After adjusting for 
prices, wages have risen 1.5 percent an-
nually over the last 5 years.’’ Social 
Security 2100 would only be a small im-
pact on the pay increase of a new FICA 
tax. 
This was in Economy for All on No-
vember 12, 2019. The Congressional 
Budget Office also reports this. 
This will be the only bill that we will 
be able to vote on this year that both 
reduces the national debt by $525 bil-
lion and expands and improves Social 
Security. 
Let me repeat that again. 
CBO has said that Social Security 
2100 is both PAYGO compliant and, be-
cause the program is fully paid for, re-
duces the national debt by $525 billion 
over time and enhances the existence 
of Social Security, making it solvent 
for future generations beyond 75 years. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY
K. 
DAVIS), if he has a final word. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, the final word is only 
to make sure that Social Security is in 
your plans, and be ready to accept it 
when we get it. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
f 
CRISIS AT THE BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
UNDERWOOD). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
first of all, I will let you know, so we 
break the suspense, I will probably be 
more like 5 minutes, so it is easier for 
everybody. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk 
one more time about the crisis at the 
border. 
One more week has gone by, and for 
1 more week, Donald Trump is out 
there alone fighting to preserve the in-
tegrity of our border and who the fu-
ture citizens of the United States of 
America are. 
Donald Trump is a fan of immigra-
tion, that is why, on his watch, we are 
now up to around 750,000 people being 
sworn in legally in this country every 
year, and there has been no effort made 
to really substantially reduce that 
number. 
Nevertheless, we do want to pick our 
immigrants. We want our immigrants 
to be people who have come here le-
gally and are appropriately vetted, and 
Donald Trump is doing what he can— 
without any help from Congress, I 
might add—to make sure that that 
happens. 
The first thing that Congress has to 
do is to make permanent the Public 
Charge rule. Donald Trump has cor-
rectly said, even for legal immigrants, 
we are not going to take people in this 
country if we expect they would be per-
manently, or close to permanently, 
taking advantage of the programs our 
government has to offer. 
Right now, 63 percent of the nonciti-
zens, compared to 35 percent of the na-
tive-born, are on some sort of govern-
ment program. We have a hard enough 
time at this time of trillion-dollar defi-
cits taking care of our own citizens 
who have fallen on hard times without 
taking the people who are on hard 
times from all around the world. 
Donald Trump is putting his finger in 
the spigot, but we know the day will 
come when we have a different Presi-
dent. When we have a different Presi-
dent, I am scared to death the new 
President will go back to the old meth-
od of anybody can come here, and, if 
they come to our country for free Pell 
grants, if they come to our country for 
free food, if they come to our country 
for free medical care, if they come to 
our country for free housing, we will 
let them back in. 
Madam Speaker, I wish President 
Trump would always be able to prevent 
that, and I am sure he is going to con-
tinue to prevent that as long as he is 
President; but, if you look at the other 
people running for the job, I wouldn’t 
bet that even by this time next year, 
and certainly within 5 years, we won’t 
be back to the days of being the wel-
fare magnet for the Western Hemi-
sphere or the entire world. 
Madam Speaker, I call on Congress to 
step up and pass legislation that a fu-
ture President cannot undue, stating 
that we are not going to have more 
people here as a public charge. 
Secondly, a couple weeks ago, I went 
down to the border one more time and 
had a chance to talk to local law en-
forcement, some of the citizens on the 
border, as well as the Border Patrol. 
They are appreciative of the things 
that the current administration is 
doing. 
I saw 12 miles of wall being built at 
the Arizona border. I saw that, while it 
might be possible to get around the 
wall, it would be very difficult. I don’t 
think most people could climb a 30-foot 
wall, much less get over the concertina 
wire on top, much less get down the 
other side. 
But, again, those are actions from 
President Trump. I wish, in the future 
appropriations bill, Congress would 
fully fund that wall like the Border Pa-
trol, who sees what is going on every 
day, wishes they had. 
President Trump has reached an 
agreement with the Mexican Govern-
ment so that people coming here seek-
ing asylum pending their hearing can 
be held in Mexico rather than coming 
across, living in this country, having 
children with birthright citizenship, 
and taking advantage of laws that law- 
abiding people from other countries 
don’t have. 
Again, President Trump has reached 
an agreement with Mexico, and that is 
why we have gone from 80,000 or 90,000 
people, at least, coming in the border 
in May of last year to under 2,000, we

believe, more recently. But, again, that 
is another victory that could be short- 
lived. 
We heard again, currently, it could 
easily be over 90 percent of the 
fentanyl, of the meth and heroin come 
across the border. This should be a na-
tional crisis. More people are dying on 
an annual basis from this scourge than 
died in the entire Vietnam war. 
Nevertheless, it is still treated as no 
big deal, and Congress is not going out 
of its way to do anywhere near what it 
should to prevent these drugs from 
coming across the border, which are 
killing our citizens. 
Furthermore, the drug cartels who 
control that border are breaking up 
families and taking advantage of young 
people, 14-, 15-year-olds, to smuggle 
across the border. 
Why do they do it? Because they 
know, in the United States, we are not 
going to incarcerate people who are 15 
years old for sneaking drugs across the 
border. 
It amazes Border Patrol that, a few 
times, some potential immigrant com-
mits a crime and they are separated 
from their children; meanwhile, the 
drug cartels have thousands of people 
separated from their parents to do 
their dirty work and barely a peep 
from the average American Congress-
man who is so worried about things 
otherwise. 
We also had a chance to look at the 
Nogales border and see what is going 
on there and the possibility that people 
are going over the wall. We heard, 
again, we could use more dogs on the 
southern border, not only to detect 
drugs coming across one way, but to 
detect cash coming across the other 
way—something else that, if this Con-
gress really cared about our border, 
they would do something about. 
We heard, again, about the dangers of 
having the drug cartels control our 
southern border rather than our Border 
Patrol, wealthy drug cartels that may 
be paying off some American citizens 
who live on the border and may be pay-
ing off Mexican military, maybe Mexi-
can police. When they sneak people 
over the border, it is not unusual to 
have these people dehydrate in the Ari-
zona desert. It is not unusual to have 
these people drown in the Rio Grande 
River. 
The fault is the inactivity of the 
American Congress to really secure 
these borders so we don’t continue to 
empower the Mexican drug cartels that 
are not only causing people to die com-
ing here, but are also corrupting the 
Mexican Government, resulting in the 
high homicide rates that we see south 
of the border. 
Madam Speaker, I call upon Congress 
to act to immediately hire more Bor-
der Patrol, to hire more dogs, to make 
sure we have enough funding for the 
wall, to permanently cause people try-
ing to come into this country to have 
to stay south of the border pending 
their asylum hearing, to change the 
asylum laws so that anybody can’t just 
say ‘‘I am in danger in my home coun-
try’’ and come here, and, above all, to 
change the public benefits rule so that 
our future immigrants are uniformly 
hardworking people who are going to 
be an asset to America rather than the 
current situation in which they are ap-
parently disproportionately the type of 
people who come on the government. 
We are all willing to take care of the 
people in the United States who have 
fallen on hard times, but the idea of 
going back to the days in which people 
all around the world know that the 
United States of America is the welfare 
magnet for anyone is ruining our coun-
try, and it is hard to imagine people 
who don’t take these actions as any-
thing other than people who want to 
permanently change our country. 
Madam Speaker, I call on Congress to 
take action that President Trump 
would suggest so that, if, God forbid, 
anything happened to him, we still are 
in a position to protect our border and 
save our great country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ENROLLED BILL SIGNED 
Cheryl L. Johnson, Clerk of the 
House, reported and found truly en-

eral subsidies from being used to purchase

ing national security risks, to provide for 
the establishment of a reimbursement pro-
gram for the replacement of communications

PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE 116th CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION

S1273 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MARCH 3, 2020 
No. 42 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, we bask in the warmth 
of Your glory. You uphold the universe 
by the words of Your power today. 
Today, walk with our Senators as 
they work. Help them to remember 
that there is no purity without vigi-
lance, no learning without study, and 
no mastery without discipline. Lord, 
give them the wisdom to be willing to 
pay the price to honor You. Provide 
them with joy in service and devotion 
in discipleship. Infuse them with a spir-
it of power, love, and self-control. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent for 1 minute in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
BANGLADESH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
an op-ed I penned recently mentioned 
countries that still have blasphemy 
laws on the books, and it touched a 
nerve in Bangladesh. I certainly didn’t 
mean to imply that it was the worst of-
fender, and I commend Bangladesh for 
its 
support 
of 
almost 
1 
million 
Rohingya Muslim refugees who are 
fleeing Burma. Bangladesh’s secular 
government has also taken steps to 
prosecute perpetrators of religious- 
based crimes. 
However, a 2016 report by the U.S. 
Commission on International Religious 
Freedom found that religious and civil 
society groups in Bangladesh fear in-
creasing religious extremism. More-
over, some Bangladeshi leaders have 
warned that violators of the blasphemy 
laws would be prosecuted. 
Bangladesh and the 68 other coun-
tries that still have blasphemy laws on 
the books should repeal these laws. 
That is why I am cosponsoring a reso-
lution, S. Res. 458, calling on the global 
repeal of blasphemy laws. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
S. 2657 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this week, the Senate has a good oppor-
tunity to update the laws governing 
the way we harness and deploy Amer-
ica’s tremendous domestic energy re-
sources. It has been well over a decade 
since the last time comprehensive en-
ergy legislation was signed into Fed-
eral law. 
Following our overwhelming vote 
yesterday to proceed to consideration 
of the American Energy Innovation 
Act, the Senate is on track to change 
that very soon. The American Energy 
Innovation Act put forward by Chair-
man MURKOWSKI and Ranking Member 
MANCHIN is thoroughly bipartisan. It 
contains provisions sponsored or co-
sponsored by more than 60 of our col-
leagues. It has come to include 50 indi-
vidual pieces of legislation that the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee considered last year. 
Over the past 3 years, the Trump ad-
ministration and this Congress have 
worked together to secure historic ad-
vances for both the producers and con-
sumers of affordable domestic energy. 
We have opened access to new energy 
reserves, streamlined the regulation of 
liquid natural gas exports, and halted 
or reversed the most egregious Obama- 
era regulatory burdens. The growing 
record is clear. We have helped to usher 
in a prosperous new era of U.S. energy 
independence. 
The legislation we are considering 
this week is designed to build on those 
successes. It takes proactive steps to 
ensure the security, efficiency, and af-
fordability of American energy for 
years to come. 
First, it puts a strong tailwind be-
hind programs, grants, and research ef-
forts that are focused on energy inno-
vation. That means significant invest-
ments in improving energy efficiency 
and grid storage technologies; new re-
sources for the development of renew-
able geothermal, nuclear, and other en-
ergy sources to help sustain domestic 
energy independence; reauthorization 
for the Department of Energy’s cut-
ting-edge research at the Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency; and a renewed 
commitment to carbon capture, utili-
zation, and storage at coal production 
facilities. 
In addition to energy innovation, the 
legislation also focuses on energy secu-
rity. Since the last comprehensive up-
date to the Federal energy laws in 2007, 
our Nation’s critical infrastructure, in-
cluding the electric grid, has changed 
significantly, and so have the threats 
it faces. Our colleagues’ legislation 
tackles this head-on. It introduces in-
centives for electrical grid moderniza-
tion and cyber security projects. It en-
courages utility providers to take 
proactive measures to protect rate-
payers from the devastating effects of 
potential cyber attacks. It makes new 
technical cyber security assistance 
available to municipalities and rural 
utilities and authorizes grant funding 
for on-the-job workforce retraining.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1274 
March 3, 2020 
Perhaps most importantly, the legis-
lation before us is not only designed for 
continued advances in areas where the 
U.S. energy sector has seen success, it 
is also meant to take a sober assess-
ment of where we are falling short. 
As my colleague Chairman MUR-
KOWSKI
noted yesterday, the United 
States currently relies on foreign im-
ports to meet our demand for dozens of 
mineral commodities. We are talking 
about rare substances with critical ap-
plications in manufacturing, energy 
production, 
and 
national 
security. 
These are critical products, but at 
present, domestic production does not 
satisfy domestic demand. That is why 
this legislation provides for new survey 
and cataloging efforts to identify new 
domestic supplies of important mate-
rials. It invests in extraction tech-
nologies that would harness existing 
mining infrastructure in places like 
Appalachian coal country to help meet 
the demand. 
As the senior Senator from Ken-
tucky, I know the importance of these 
investments firsthand. The working 
families and job creators in my State 
know that clean coal technologies and 
longstanding mining operations can 
continue to add tremendous value to 
the security and prosperity of our Na-
tion. 
There is a reason why this legislation 
has earned widespread praise from the 
researchers and energy industry lead-
ers who would be affected the most. It 
is a product of serious, good-faith, bi-
partisan work. That is why organiza-
tions from the National Mining Asso-
ciation to the Environmental Defense 
Fund have found common ground in en-
dorsing it. 
I will have more to say about this 
legislation in the coming days, but 
right now, I am grateful for our col-
leagues on the Energy Committee for 
their work in bringing it to the floor. I 
look forward to considering their im-
portant legislation in the days ahead, 
and I would encourage all Members to 
join me in supporting this excellent 
work.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic Leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the number of confirmed coronavirus 
cases in the United States has recently 
surpassed 100. As more Americans are 
tested in the days and weeks to come, 
that number is expected to increase. 
Just this morning, we learned that a 
second New Yorker, from New Rochelle 
in Westchester County, has contracted 
the virus and is in serious condition 
and currently in a New York hospital. 
Our prayers are with him and his fam-
ily. 
This only underlines the urgent need 
to respond to the coronavirus on a na-
tional scale. The only appropriate re-
sponse in Congress is to come together 
quickly and in a bipartisan fashion to 
deliver the resources and authorities 
our Federal agencies need to track and 
combat the virus, treat Americans 
with the disease, and develop a vaccine 
and additional treatments. We also 
must aid the States and localities in 
their efforts to deal with the disease 
because they are on the frontlines. 
I am glad that Congress is headed in 
that direction. I expect that, today, ap-
propriators will announce an agree-
ment on an emergency, bipartisan 
funding package to deal with the 
coronavirus. The agreement is expected 
to include between $7 billion and $8 bil-
lion of funding—very close to the $8.5 
billion that we Senate Democrats re-
quested last week—and over four or 
five times the amount of new funding 
initially proposed by the administra-
tion. 
That is good news. When it comes to 
Americans’ health and safety, there is 
no reason to be penny wise and pound 
foolish. If the bean counters at OMB 
unnecessarily cut the money we need, 
it will cost us more in the long run. It 
is far better to get our public health 
professionals, experts, and agencies the 
funding they need, up front and all to-
gether, rather than be forced to pass 
additional appropriations in the com-
ing months. We may have to, but we 
ought not skimp now. If we did skimp, 
the scenario would make no sense. Yet, 
left to its own devices, that is what the 
administration would have done. So I 
am glad we pushed them earlier, de-
spite the fact that President Trump 
didn’t want to hear anything contrary 
to what he was proposing. 
I am pleased that both parties in 
Congress, in both Houses of Congress, 
are coming together to do the respon-
sible thing. I hope and expect that we 
can pass the emergency appropriations 
through the Senate before the end of 
the week. 
As Congress does what is necessary 
to respond to the coronavirus, unfortu-
nately, the Trump administration’s ef-
forts leave much to be desired. While 
the Trump administration’s response is 
slow, halting, loose with the facts, and 
President Trump blames everyone but 
himself, Congress—Democrats and Re-
publicans, House and Senate—are act-
ing like the adults in the room. We are 
not letting President Trump’s accusa-
tions and nastiness, his false state-
ments and his inability to really grap-
ple with the problem—and, instead, try 
to brush it away—get in our way of 
doing what America needs to have done 
and done immediately. 
Congressional appropriators have had 
to include provisions in the emergency 
bill to prevent the administration from 
stealing funds from other public health 
and disease programs to fight the 
coronavirus. That is what the White 
House wanted to do. Test kits were not 
as widely available or accurate as they 
should have been in the early days of 
the coronavirus outbreak. POLITICO 
reported this morning that the admin-
istration was very slow to develop an 
accurate test for coronavirus and slow 
to allow hospitals and public health 
labs to develop that on their own. 
The emergency funding bill seeks to 
deal with these two issues. It explicitly 
funds laboratory testing. We may have 
to do even more in the weeks to come, 
but that is no reason not to imme-
diately give a generous appropriation 
so that testing can be done. Every day 
we delay testing, every time a person 
who needs a test doesn’t get one, is a 
day and a time when the virus gets 
worse and worse and worse and can 
spread. 
There are still major issues with the 
lack of testing infrastructure that is 
being provided by the administration. 
States and cities still don’t have 
enough tests, and yesterday we heard 
from the National Indian Health Board 
that the Indian Health Service and 
Tribal health facilities are being left 
behind in the coronavirus response and 
have received few, if any, resources. 
That is unacceptable. 
Meanwhile, 
as 
Congress 
works— 
Democrats and Republicans, House and 
Senate—to come up with a strong, 
comprehensive bill with the necessary 
dollars, President Trump continues to 
spread rumor, loose speculation, and 
happy talk. If any member of the ad-
ministration tells the President some-
thing optimistic, he repeats it and ex-
aggerates it to the point of absurdity. 
The President said the disease might 
magically ‘‘disappear’’ once the weath-
er gets warmer and promised that the

vaccine 
would 
arrive 
‘‘soon’’—his 
words. Only yesterday were a group of 
governmental health experts and phar-
maceutical executives able to convince 
the President that a vaccine will not be 
ready in a matter of months—as the 
President believed and said—and, in 
fact, could take a year to develop. 
We need leadership in this country. 
We need serious leadership at a time of 
crisis like this. We don’t need the facts 
being brushed under the rug. We don’t 
need executives being told: Just do 
happy talk. Don’t tell the American 
people the truth. 
We don’t need a President who 
doesn’t know the facts and blithely 
states whatever pops into his head that 
he thinks will benefit him for the mo-
ment. 
This is a crisis. There is no sub-
stitute for credibility and honesty from 
our political leaders. We need the 
President and his team to level with 
the American people and tell the truth, 
more during a health crisis than ever 
before. Our public health professionals 
must tell the President the facts, and 
the President and his team must tell 
the American public the facts—just the 
facts. 
Now, the Vice President and Ambas-
sador Debbie Birx will speak to both 
Senate caucuses at lunch today. I am 
disappointed that Dr. Anthony Fauci, 
the Director of the National Institute 
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who 
was originally slated to join us, is no 
longer coming, but Senate Democrats 
have many questions for the Vice 
President about his administration’s 
response to the outbreak and, even 
more importantly, what they are doing 
now to help deal with the problem as it 
gets worse and worse. 
We look forward to pressing him on 
the need for transparency and decisive-
ness and hopefully getting useful an-
swers because the health and safety of 
the American people are at stake. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
Samuel Johnson was a great thinker in 
the 19th century and was quoted many 
times for things that he observed even 
then. He did have one statement about 
nothing focusing the mind like the 
prospect of a hanging, and I would like 
to use that as an analogy to my com-
ments this morning. 
I do notice that the Senator from 
South Dakota has taken the floor. Let 
me yield to him because I think, in the 
order of speaking, he is next, and I will 
follow him. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
S. 2657 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I 
thank the Democratic whip for yield-
ing time. I will be short here. 
We are in a pretty good place in this 
country right now when it comes to en-
ergy. Our energy supply is abundant, 
and energy prices are generally afford-
able. We can’t afford to become com-
placent. We are in a good place right 
now because of American innovation, 
because 
President 
Trump, 
working 
with our Republican majority in the 
Congress, took steps to expand our do-
mestic energy supply and to lessen our 
dependence upon foreign oil. 
If we want to keep American energy 
affordable and abundant, we need to 
make sure we stay on the cutting edge 
of energy innovation and continue to 
invest in our domestic energy supply, 
from oil and natural gas to renewable 
energy sources like hydropower and 
wind. We also need to make sure we 
stay on top of threats to our energy 
grid and our energy security. 
Our colleagues at the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee have 
spent a lot of time over the past 
months working on these issues, and 
yesterday we voted to move forward on 
bipartisan energy legislation put for-
ward by Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee Chairman LISA MURKOWSKI 
and Ranking Member JOE
MANCHIN. 
The bill they put together, the Amer-
ican Energy Innovation Act, contains 
measures from more than 60 Senators 
focused on energy innovation—particu-
larly, clean energy innovation—work-
place development, and the security of 
our energy grid. 
The American Energy Innovation Act 
invests in a wide range of clean energy 
technologies, from wind and solar to 
hydropower and geothermal. It also fo-
cuses on improving energy storage. 
Many 
modern 
clean 
energy 
tech-
nologies are intermittent or lack the 
reliability 
of 
traditional 
electric 
sources. The amount of energy pro-
duced from wind, for example, is de-
pendent on the amount of wind on any 
given day. So it must be backed up by 
a traditional plant, often powered by 
natural gas. 
Creating new ways to store clean en-
ergy will allow us to increase our reli-
ance on renewable energy sources. The 
American Energy Innovation Act also 
focuses on improving research into car-
bon capture, and it directs the estab-
lishment of a research and develop-
ment program to identify ways to use 
captured carbon. 
The bill also invests in advanced nu-
clear energy research so that we can 
regain our edge in the use of this clean 
energy technology. 
I plan to introduce amendments to 
the legislation to review where we can 
boost hydropower in the Upper Mis-
souri River Basin and to develop ways 
to recycle the windmill blades used in 
wind energy generation. 
Nearly half of the electricity gen-
erated in South Dakota is from hydro-
electric, and we should explore build-
ing off of these investments through 
repowering existing dams and adding 
power generation to those without. 
In addition to clean energy and inno-
vation, the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee’s legislation fo-
cuses on boosting the security of our 
electric grid. Our electric grid is the 
subject of a steady stream of cyber at-
tacks, some of which could have dev-
astating consequences. It is not hard to 
imagine the deadly results of prolonged 
traffic signal outages or long-term 
power outages at hospitals or fire sta-
tions. That is why the American En-
ergy Innovation Act invests in cyber 
security and grid modernization. 
The act also focuses on improving 
our domestic supply of some of the key 
elements and minerals that we rely on 
for manufacturing everything from 
computer chips to batteries, to defense 
applications. Right now we have to im-
port too much—too much—of these 
critical minerals from countries like 
China. For the sake of our national se-
curity, it is important that we find 
ways to identify supplies of these min-
erals here at home. 
Finally, the American Energy Inno-
vation Act invests in workforce devel-
opment. 
All 
the 
innovative 
tech-
nologies in the world will not help us if 
we don’t have the skilled workers to 
operate 
and 
maintain 
these 
tech-
nologies. We need to ensure that, while 
we are investing in innovation, we are 
also investing in the energy workforce 
of the future. 
This legislation would help ensure 
that we maintain our energy independ-
ence for the long term. It will boost the 
security of our electric grid, strength-
en our national security, and invest in 
American workers. It will help pave 
the way for a clean energy future. 
This is a good bill, and I hope that 
my colleagues will support it and not 
derail this legislation with partisan 
amendments. I know many of my col-
leagues across the aisle have a keen in-
terest in adding certain energy tax pro-
visions to this bill. I will remind them, 
however, that last summer the Senate 
Finance Committee created a number 
of task forces to examine expiring and 
expired tax policies. I co-led the En-
ergy Task Force along with the senior 
Senator from Michigan, and many of 
the energy tax items that we reviewed 
were included in the year-end bill in 
December. Others were not yet ready 
for prime time. 
I am eager to continue to work with 
my colleagues on advancing American 
energy innovation, as this bill will do, 
but we have to be realistic about the 
fact that a number of the energy tax 
proposals in question are not yet ready 
for implementation and need to be con-
sidered in the context of other reforms 
and corrections to the Tax Code. 
As I said, I hope debate over tax pro-
visions or other amendments will not 
delay passage of this important bipar-
tisan legislation, and I look forward to 
working with colleagues of both parties 
to advance this bill and to help secure 
America’s energy future. 
I yield the floor.

March 3, 2020 
hanging. I would say there is nothing 
that focuses the mind on the issue of 
healthcare like the prospect of a pan-
demic, and that is what we are facing 
now with the coronavirus. Americans 
should not panic and shouldn’t be pes-
simistic, but we need to be realistic as 
the numbers total up around the world 
and we start to take an assessment of 
our own vulnerabilities—personal, fam-
ily, community, and State vulnerabili-
ties—here in the United States of 
America. 
We are also, I hope, reflecting on 
what we are counting on to get us 
through this pandemic in a positive 
fashion in America. The first thing is 
we look to two major healthcare orga-
nizations of the Federal Government: 
the National Institutes of Health, 
which is the premier health research 
agency in the world, and the Centers 
for Disease Control, which, again, leads 
the world when it comes to preventing 
the spread of disease and threats to the 
public health of America. 
The question we should ask ourselves 
is, How have we treated these agencies 
to date? The answers are mixed. The 
answer, when it comes to National In-
stitutes of Health, is a positive one. 
Over the last 4 years, something dra-
matic has occurred. I was happy to be 
part of a bipartisan effort that was led 
by Senator PATTY MURRAY of Wash-
ington, Senator ROY
BLUNT
of Mis-
souri, and Senator LAMAR ALEXANDER 
of Tennessee. What we have accom-
plished in the last 4 years is to increase 
the spending at the National Institutes 
of Health for medical research grants 
from $30 billion to $39 billion. It is a 
dramatic increase. 
We started off with a premise we 
wanted to increase the NIH budget by 
real growth of 5 percent—that is 5 per-
cent over inflation—each year. We held 
to that standard; in fact, some years 
were even better. We have a lot to show 
for it. There have been real break-
throughs when it comes to medical re-
search. We want to continue down this 
line. 
When it came to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control, I had the same goal in 
mind. We didn’t quite reach it. Over 
the last 4 years, we have seen a 14-per-
cent increase at the CDC. I believe this 
coronavirus pandemic threat is going 
to open the eyes of America to the need 
to make sure the CDC is adequately, 
properly funded for years to come. 
At the outset, the focus of the mind 
is on those agencies of government 
which do the absolute essential work of 
research and the prevention of the 
spread of disease. The NIH and CDC 
need to occupy a special place when it 
comes to budgeting by the Federal 
Government. 
The second thing we note is there are 
practical questions to be asked and an-
swered. We are now talking about the 
development of a test to determine 
whether individuals have been affected 
by the coronavirus. That test is now 
starting to come forward. It will be re-
leased in States across the United 
States in the next several weeks. 
Some obvious, practical questions 
face us: How much does this test cost? 
Is it covered by health insurance? If it 
is not covered by health insurance, can 
the average family afford it? These are 
the practical questions which those of 
us who have good health insurance and 
are not worried about the next pay-
check can take care of, but for millions 
of Americans, it is a significant chal-
lenge. We notice that in some cases it 
takes more than one test to determine 
that a person is truly free of the 
coronavirus. 
The obvious question is, Does our 
health insurance cover this kind of 
testing? As I stand here, I don’t know 
the answer to it. If it turns out to be an 
expensive test, and it is not covered by 
insurance, Americans are going to be 
faced with that challenge right off the 
bat. 
It brings to mind the real funda-
mental issue of the debate in Congress 
over the last 10 years about health in-
surance. Our friends on the other side 
of the aisle argue that people ought to 
be able to pay less for health insurance 
that covers even less. We on this side 
call that junk insurance. The Afford-
able Care Act said that health insur-
ance plans had to have certain basic 
coverage before they could be offered 
in this country. We got rid of the life-
time limits that some health insurance 
plans had. We eliminated the discrimi-
nation against people with preexisting 
conditions. We said that kids could 
stay on their parents’ health insurance 
plan until they reached the age of 26. 
We said every health insurance plan 
had to include those provisions. We in-
cluded coverage in basic health insur-
ance of mental illness and addiction 
services—basic fundamental care that 
every American should expect when 
they buy health insurance. 
The Republicans on the other side of 
the aisle say: Well, we ought to be able 
to buy insurance that doesn’t cover 
those things. It will be cheaper. Let the 
consumers decide. 
It is OK for a consumer to decide for 
less coverage, I suppose, if they can be 
guaranteed good health for the rest of 
their lives. No one knows about the 
next accident or the next diagnosis 
that might really call into question the 
adequacy of our health insurance cov-
erage. 
I stand with the Affordable Care Act. 
We should have a basic standard when 
it comes to health insurance in Amer-
ica so that when you buy a plan, it cov-
ers what most Americans will need, the 
basics that they will need. Junk insur-
ance has no place in America, and it is 
no bargain for people who truly need 
health insurance for reimbursement. 
When it comes to the cost of dealing 
with the coronavirus, whether it is the 
initial test or followup hospitaliza-
tions, we all want the peace of mind 
that our health insurance plan will 
cover those needs. 
The third issue that is clear is that 
there are people who are going to miss 
work because of this coronavirus. Some 
of them are asked to stay home and 
work from home and things continue 
as usual, and they receive their regular 
paycheck, but for others, they have to 
leave the workplace because of fears 
they may have a flu or may be con-
tagious or someone else at work might 
be. What happens when they go home 
when it comes to their paycheck? Are 
they going to be given medical leave 
and paid for their absences? 
It is an issue which comes to the 
forefront in this coronavirus debate. 
Frankly, it is with us all of the time. 
Those of us on the Democratic side be-
lieve that medical leave should be ex-
tended. We have just expanded it when 
it comes to Federal employees. We 
should do it as well for people across 
the United States. Medical leave gives 
you peace of mind to make the right 
medical decision. Don’t go to work 
with a fever. Don’t go to school with a 
fever. Stay home. Protect yourself, 
your family, the people you work with, 
the people you are around during the 
course of a day. Medical leave gives 
you that option, and it is one that is a 
practical solution to something that 
we face all the time. 
The fourth issue that I will raise has 
been brought up by this coronavirus 
debate is the role of pharma in the fu-
ture. It is interesting that across 
America when you ask Americans their 
concern when it comes to the cost of 
healthcare, the cost of prescription 
drugs is high on the list. 
It is also interesting that health in-
surance companies—the major compa-
nies—tell us that one of the biggest 
drivers in the increase in health insur-
ance premiums is the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs. Pharma is obviously a chal-
lenge to all of us. We want them to 
have the money to be profitable, to in-
vest in research, but we don’t want 
them to dramatically overcharge for 
the 
products 
they 
make. 
‘‘Your 
money’’ or ‘‘your life’’ is not a good an-
swer when it comes to pharma and the 
public health of America. 
Now we are going to face it again, 
the prospect of a vaccine. We hope to 
have a vaccine quickly, but even 
‘‘quickly’’ by medical terms is a long 
time. 
Dr. Fauci, of NIH, has said it could be 
a year, a year and a half, even 2 years 
before a real, reliable vaccine is discov-
ered to deal with coronavirus. It is an 
indication of the kind of research that 
has to take place—research that starts, 
I might add, at the Federal level, with 
your government doing research. 
I know pharmaceutical companies 
will ultimately produce the product, 
the vaccine, but it starts with an in-
vestment by the Federal Government 
in the basic research to lead up to that 
vaccine whenever it is discovered. Then 
we have the question about once the 
vaccine is discovered, who will sell it 
to America and at what price? That is 
a debate that we went through several 
years ago. 
We faced the swine flu. During that 
period of time, some 40 million Ameri-
cans were actually vaccinated in 1976

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1277 
March 3, 2020 
for swine flu—45 million, to be exact. 
For several months, four pharma-
ceutical firms refused to sell the vac-
cine they had manufactured to the gov-
ernment until they received full liabil-
ity indemnity and a guaranteed profit. 
The 
vaccine 
was 
there, 
but 
they 
wouldn’t sell it until they received 
those promises. In fact, the Federal 
Government assumed the liability for 
this vaccine. According to this article 
that was published this morning in the 
New York Times, they eventually paid 
out over $100 million in claims. 
Are we going to face that again with 
pharma when it comes to a vaccine for 
coronavirus? Certainly, they are enti-
tled to a profit for their own invest-
ment, whatever it may be in that vac-
cine, but the initial work on the re-
search is being done by the Federal 
Government. That Federal Government 
research will lead to a product which 
will lead to a profit for these compa-
nies. 
I am not opposed to a reasonable 
profit, but I do think, if they are going 
to hold us hostage for months over a 
guaranteed profit that is unreasonable, 
that America is going to rebel against 
these pharmaceutical companies. Our 
debate about pharma and its relation-
ship with America in the future has 
really sharpened its focus by this de-
bate on the coronavirus that we are 
facing today. 
Madam President, there is one other 
aspect that I would like to raise. I was 
surprised at the briefing we received 2 
weeks ago in Washington on the 
coronavirus to learn how many phar-
maceuticals are actually produced in 
China and how many pharmaceutical 
ingredients are produced in China and 
India. It turns out we have a real de-
pendence, when it comes to developing 
medicines and drugs, on these two 
countries and many others. When it 
comes to medical devices, the same is 
true; medical equipment, the same. 
It raised a question in my mind as to 
whether 
we 
should 
do 
something 
thoughtful and perspective in terms of 
dealing with global dependence on 
medicine, medical devices, and medical 
supplies. 
I am introducing legislation this 
week calling for the creation of a com-
mission to look at this dependence, to 
measure it today. Today we are facing 
the coronavirus, the possible—I under-
line ‘‘possible’’—interruption in the 
supply of pharmaceuticals and the sup-
ply of pharmaceutical ingredients from 
China because of the coronavirus. Did 
we anticipate this? Have we stockpiled 
enough of these drugs so we will not be 
caught short on something that is ab-
solutely 
vital? 
If 
we 
haven’t, 
we 
should. 
We should also think about the pros-
pect that in the future, for certain crit-
ical drugs, there should be a domestic 
source in the United States that we 
can count on if there is some interrup-
tion in global trade because of a med-
ical crisis such as this or because of 
terrorism, for example. I hope we can 
get some guidance on this from the 
agencies involved and from those we 
respect who can give us third-party 
judgment on this. 
Let us, at this moment in time as we 
face this crisis, look ahead to what the 
next challenge might be and be pre-
pared 
for 
it. 
As 
we 
debate 
this 
coronavirus, I urge my colleagues to do 
our best to try to find bipartisan 
ground to work on. I have found, across 
my State, regardless of political alle-
giance, the people of Illinois and in 
many other States are looking for us in 
Washington to address this problem re-
sponsibly, in a mature way, in a totally 
nonpolitical way. 
When statements are made by polit-
ical observers, even by the President 
himself, that are far afield from the 
truth, let’s not be derailed by that. 
Let’s focus on medical expertise that 
we can trust, public health experts who 
can guide us through this in the appro-
priate way. 
In the meantime, realize we are 
blessed to live in a country with the 
best, most talented medical profes-
sionals in the world and the best med-
ical resources on Earth. We want to 
make certain we give them all the 
room they need to lead us through this 
crisis and challenge in a very positive 
way. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
have prepared remarks, but before I do 
that, I want to thank the pages who 
are in this class right now. They are 
hard at work, and they do so much for 
this institution. I just want it written 
in the RECORD of the U.S. Senate that 
on this day in March, the junior Sen-
ator from New Jersey recognized them 
for everything they do around here, 
even though they do not tell jokes that 
are very good. 
Now, if I may start my prepared re-
marks, I rise today with other col-
leagues who are speaking, particularly 
my colleague from Connecticut, Sen-
ator MURPHY, to speak on a bill that 
actually passed out of the House, which 
was something that was extraordinary. 
It passed out of the House of Rep-
resentatives just over a full year ago, 
and we are waiting here in the Senate 
for it to come to the floor. 
I am one of these folks who really be-
lieve that we have too much unneces-
sary partisanship around issues when 
there is so much common cause in our 
country and when there is so much 
common ground in our country. Yes, 
indeed, debate is important. Disagree-
ment is important. It undergirds the 
ideals of democracy that we should 
form a national conversation and work 
through our differences—the idea that 
that actually produces a better whole 
and a better result. 
But when we have a nation that has 
such extensive agreement on an issue, 
where 97 percent of Americans agree, 
where Republicans and Democrats in 
the House of Representatives agree, 
and we can’t get action here, to me, 
that is not adding to the strength of 
democracy. It is weakening our Repub-
lic. 
It was almost exactly a year ago that 
the House of Representatives passed 
H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act of 2019. This legislation 
would require a background check be-
fore any sale or transfer of a firearm. 
Under existing law, you can go to a gun 
show and purchase a gun from an unli-
censed seller without having gone 
through a background check. Think 
about this. You could be on a terrorist 
no-fly list; you could be a convicted 
felon; and you could be a spousal 
abuser. You can be a lot of things— 
anything—and be able to go to an unli-
censed seller at a gun show and fill up 
a trunk full of weapons. This is a glar-
ing loophole that allows dangerous in-
dividuals—who we all agree are dan-
gerous—to purchase a gun in violation 
of Federal law. 
Again, 97 percent of Americans want-
ed that loophole closed. The evidence is 
clear. A study found last year that 
States that have this commonsense, 
widely supported, bipartisanly backed 
background check law—when States 
have it in place, they get 10 percent 
lower homicide rates. This isn’t specu-
lation. Folks who have that law in 
place on a State level have 10 percent 
fewer homicides. 
But today, over a year out of its pas-
sage out of the House, the Senate has 
failed to take up this commonsense 
bill, which we know—which we know 
factually—would save lives. 
What is one of the fundamental rea-
sons our government was founded in 
the first place? For the common de-
fense. We are here to defend our Nation 
from violence, from terror, from in-
jury, from harm. Everyone in this body 
takes that commitment very seriously. 
So here we have something 97 percent 
of Americans want. We know it would 
save lives, protect our country and, 
yet, no action. The bill has not come to 
the floor. 
I know this personally. I was the 
mayor of my State’s largest city, and 
in the overwhelming majority of homi-
cides and shootings where we captured 
the person and found out how they got 
their gun, they were not qualified to 
buy a gun. It was illegal for them to 
buy a gun in any State because many 
of them had criminal convictions. Yet 
they found easy ways to obtain a gun 
because we have so many loopholes in 
the commonsense law—loopholes that 
allow violence to happen that is terror-
izing communities. Of course, we know 
that is not just anecdotal evidence. Ac-
cording to the Gun Violence Archive,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1278 
March 3, 2020 
an estimated 15,208 people were killed 
with a gun in the United States in 2019. 
We know that gun violence is the sin-
gle leading cause of death for children 
and teenagers. Our greatest natural re-
source in this country is our children. 
Black children and teenagers are 14 
times more likely to die of gun homi-
cide than their White peers. There is 
tragic carnage going on for African- 
American kids. In just one city, for ex-
ample, in St. Louis, MO, between April 
and September of last year, 13 children 
ranging in age from 2 to 16 were killed 
by a gun. 
There is another kind of gun violence 
we don’t talk about. We don’t talk 
enough about the death of our children, 
but we definitely don’t talk about do-
mestic violence in our country. It is 
factual that when an abuser can get a 
gun—if that abuser has a gun, a victim 
of domestic violence is five times more 
likely to be killed. Again, with the ra-
cial disparities in communities of color 
like the one I live in, we know a Black 
woman is twice as likely to be shot and 
killed by an intimate partner as well. 
Our duty is to protect this Nation 
and to protect one another. This is not 
controversial when you have 97 per-
cent—97 percent. Every year in the 
United States of America, on average, 
100,000 people are shot, and they sur-
vive. Many of them will carry with 
them, for their lives, mental and phys-
ical wounds. The economic cost of 
being a gun violence survivor is meas-
ured in the tens and tens of thousands 
of dollars. The community costs of 
folks being killed—I have seen this in 
my community when a shooting hap-
pened in front of the IHOP in Newark 
on Bergen Street. The IHOP had to 
close one of its shifts, and people lost 
jobs. It reverberates out into the com-
munity. 
You see scars happening every day in 
America. These wounds are physical, 
are economic, and involve mental 
health. I can’t tell you how many com-
munities in America—when we cele-
brate the very ideas of our country on 
July 4, when those firecrackers go off 
and children hear them, they duck for 
cover. They hide under beds. They 
show signs of post-traumatic stress. 
That is what we are living in right 
now. This is an everyday reality. 
I just came to the floor today to 
point out that a year—12 months, 365 
days—from the House’s passing of the 
bipartisan bill supported by 97 percent 
of Americans, which is fundamental to 
the reason for government, the com-
mon defense in the wake of one of the 
greatest killers of children in our coun-
try—all of these things, and we here 
are doing nothing. 
What did Martin Luther King say? 
What we have to repent for is not just 
the vitriolic words and violent actions 
of the bad people; it is also the appall-
ing silence and inaction of the good 
people. 
I have stood for comprehensive gun 
safety reform, and a lot of things I sup-
port aren’t supported by 97 percent of 
Americans like background checks. 
Heck, I support gun licensing. The per-
centage of Americans who support that 
falls into the seventies. I support an as-
sault weapons ban. Support for that 
falls as well. So maybe that is an area 
where we debate. I will stand for those 
commonsense changes because, again, I 
believe in the data. States that do that 
have seen dramatic drops in violence. 
We can debate that. 
But when we have a bill from the 
House that 97 percent of Americans 
support, that has bipartisan support, 
that we know will save lives, and we 
don’t act, what does that say about us? 
Every day in this country, people are 
being shot, and people are killed, and 
we do nothing when we all agree. 
This week, March 7, will mark the 
55th anniversary of the day that 600 
civil rights activists, led by a young 
man named JOHN LEWIS, set out to 
walk from Selma to Montgomery to 
protest 
systematic 
racialized 
dis-
enfranchisement, discrimination, and 
violence. Those nonviolent protesters 
were met with vicious beatings with 
billy clubs by Alabama State troopers. 
They had tear gas and dogs set on 
them. Congressman LEWIS
had his 
skull cracked open. 
By the next day, Americans all over 
this country—that horrific scene, we 
know this as Bloody Sunday—Ameri-
cans all over this country saw that vio-
lence, saw that viciousness, and saw 
what was being done to people who 
were nonviolent marchers fighting for 
justice and equality. It motivated 
Americans of all backgrounds—Black, 
White, Christian, Jewish, Republican, 
and Democrat—to join in the call for 
change. 
I love this Nation, and I love my 
country. I love folks who agree with 
me and who disagree with me. I think 
patriotism is love of country, and you 
can’t love your country unless you love 
your fellow country men and women. 
I say to the Presiding Officer, I love 
you, man. 
My friends across the aisle, we don’t 
agree. Heck, in our own caucus, we 
don’t agree, but we love one another. 
My faith and the other faiths rep-
resented in this body—I am excited 
that we have more religious diversity 
in this body than ever before—all of 
our faiths are founded on this funda-
mental principle: Love thy neighbor. 
This is the challenge. It is, how do we 
manifest love into our policy? Well, as 
I have read, one of the great authors 
said: What does love look like in pub-
lic? It looks like justice. 
This is the great thing about our 
country. We don’t always act right 
away, but throughout our history, 
when we were confronted with the 
wretchedness of our society, with the 
incongruences between reality and our 
morals and beliefs, we have seen this 
country rise up and make change. 
When four girls died in the bombing in 
Birmingham, it shocked the conscience 
of this country, and we made change. 
When women in a factory called the 
Triangle 
shirtwaist 
factory 
were 
trapped in sweatshop-like conditions— 
a fire broke out—this country watched 
in horror, read about in horror back 
then, and saw in horror through the 
pictures of women throwing themselves 
out windows, dying on the pavement 
below, it shocked the conscience of this 
country, and we in this body passed 
laws to protect workers. I could go on 
throughout our entire history. 
We are not always fast to get there, 
but we are a caring, compassionate, 
loving country. We are. That is the 
root of who we are. They are the values 
we profess. I know that as much as we 
disagree and try to vilify each other, 
the truth is, we are a nation founded on 
the ideals of love. 
Again, I look at my colleague up 
there in that seat. I have watched him. 
I saw him on HBO reading our founding 
documents. It was moving to me to see 
Republicans and Democrats—I am sure 
you saw it—reading our founding docu-
ments. Our Declaration of Independ-
ence—I hate to say this, you might say 
I am a little too mushy—it ends with 
one of the greatest declarations of love 
in human history. It says, if we are 
going to make this Nation work, all 
the stuff we just talked about, if we are 
going to be the country that is, as the 
prophet Isaiah said, ultimately a light 
unto other nations, inspiring free peo-
ples across the globe—we are the oldest 
constitutional democracy. We stepped 
out into the course of human events 
and said we are going to found a coun-
try based on virtue, not a theocracy, 
not a monarchy, on virtue—that we 
would be a nation based on ideas. And 
those 
ideas, 
as 
imperfect 
as 
the 
geniuses who founded this country— 
and, God, they didn’t believe that 
women were equal or Blacks were 
equal, but they believed in those ideals 
and those virtues and that this Nation 
should always strive to make a more 
perfect Union, making more real those 
virtues and those values in people’s 
lives. The history of our country is a 
glorious testimony of us getting better 
and better with each generation. 
Susan B. Anthony stood up and said 
that it was we the people, not we the 
male citizens that made this country, 
not the White male citizens. It was we 
the people. She used the words of our 
founding documents to inform her mo-
ment of history to call to the con-
science of our country. 
Martin Luther King, right here in DC 
on the Mall, did he turn to some new 
radical treatise? No. He went back to 
our founding documents and quoted 
them in his speech at the March on 
Washington. That is the beauty of our 
Nation. 
So what does it say, that testimony 
to love, that the founding of our Na-
tion in the Declaration of Independ-
ence—and, yes, to all those people, I 
will give you deference that that dec-
laration called Native Americans sav-
ages. I will give you deference that the 
men who wrote them were imperfect 
representatives of the values to which

they were called to, but that declara-
tion of love at the end is unmistakable. 
At the end of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, they say, if we are to make 
it all work, we must mutually pledge— 
I look at my colleague in the seat be-
cause he knows these words backward 
and forward. It says we must mutually 
pledge; that is, pledge to each other 
our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred 
honor. 
God, I think about those words more 
than you might realize. What does it 
mean to give someone your sacred 
honor, to pledge to them your lives and 
your fortunes? God, I would die for this 
country, as I know my colleagues 
would. None of the people in this 
body—I know many of my friends in 
this body have come here with great 
wealth, but none of them are doing it 
for wealth. 
Our lives, our fortunes, but that last 
one, sacred honor, what does that 
mean? To me, a word that evokes that 
greatest of human values, love; that 
word that we honor each other. We be-
lieve we are people who must elevate 
each other and protect each other. 
There is a bill in the House that 
passed in a bipartisan way on that fun-
damental ideal of being there for one 
another. Whether you pray like me or 
look like me, we are there for one an-
other. We protect each other. We stand 
for each other. I may have differences 
with the man in that seat who is on the 
other side of the aisle, but, God, I give 
you my sacred honor that I am not 
going to vilify or demonize your char-
acter because we are Americans. 
Now, the call of our country is people 
who are overlooked are dying every 
day in communities like mine around 
this country, people being felled by do-
mestic abusers. We know from the data 
that this can make a difference, a bi-
partisan 
voice. 
Ninety 
percent 
of 
Americans ask: Can we pass com-
prehensive background checks? 
We can do better. Let’s leave the 
things we want to debate that, God, I 
want to debate—gun licensing, assault 
weapons ban, leave those aside, but we 
agree that someone on the terrorist no- 
fly list should not be able to go to a 
gun show and go to a casual seller and 
buy weapons. Those are the weapons 
showing up on the streets in Newark. 
We have traced them. 
My country tis of thee 
Sweet [sweet] land of liberty 
Of thee I sing. 
May our country be free from fear 
and free from violence, and may we be 
empathetic toward those today who are 
fearful of their abuser, who are fearful 
to walk their kids to school. May we 
understand that that liberty to fight 
for freedom from fear is still an 
unachieved dream in this country. 
That liberty that comes from safety 
and security is still an unrealized 
dream for millions of Americans. May 
we join together and pledge our lives, 
our fortunes, and our sacred honor. 
May we pledge to one another to do the 
work America wants—to keep each 
other safe and secure and to ensure our 
children, disproportionately impacted 
by violence, grow up to carry on our 
culture, and our traditions, and the 
honor that is America. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). The Senator from Missouri. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to 
talk for a few moments about where we 
are with the coronavirus response and 
the supplemental. I think all Senators 
will have an opportunity to be updated 
again today. 
This is not a new place for us to be. 
This time last year, the Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, and Re-
lated Agencies held a hearing on 
emerging threats, and at that point we 
were experiencing the second largest 
outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, antibiotic re-
sistance was a global danger, and there 
was a flu outbreak bigger than we had 
seen in a long time. So 1 year later, we 
are still fighting the Ebola outbreak in 
the DRC, antibiotic resistance con-
tinues to be a global problem, and, ac-
cording to Dr. Tony Fauci, the Direc-
tor of the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases, the flu we are 
seeing this year is shaping up to be one 
of the worst in decades. 
Several 
thousand 
Americans 
die 
every year from the flu—usually, at 
least 35,000, sometimes as high as 
75,000. I think about 350,000 Americans 
have died from the flu in the last dec-
ade. 
We are now facing a new danger—the 
COVID–19 danger. That is the new 
coronavirus that we hadn’t seen before. 
As we learned with Ebola, patient zero, 
who doesn’t know they even have this 
yet, can board a plane or a cruise ship, 
and they can be in another country or 
even in another continent in a matter 
of hours. This lesson is, once again, re-
inforced. 
This is like all other diseases. It 
doesn’t know any boundaries. We are 
no longer living in a world where our 
health can be separated from the 
health of other countries. Last week, 
the number of new coronavirus infec-
tions outside of China outpaced those 
inside China for the first time. Maybe 
the good news is that China is begin-
ning to see something headed in a dif-
ferent direction, but the bad news is 
the infections in Iran, Italy, South 
Korea, Japan, and other places. This 
has moved into Europe now, and in 
South America a case was just an-
nounced in Brazil. 
This is kind of that moment where 
we have some opportunity to do every-
thing we can to prepare for the worst, 
but we still have the option of hoping 
for the best. That is what happened 
with SARS. That is what happened 
with H1N1. To some extent, it is what 
happened with Zika. It turned out to be 
bad for the people who had it but not as 
bad as we anticipated at one point it 
might be. 
It is disturbing to see the first deaths 
in the State of Washington, but, cer-
tainly, the message to us is to be more 
vigilant and be better prepared. 
The Congress, in the last 5 years, has 
increased money—that doesn’t count 
whatever we do this week and next 
week—for preparedness by 44 percent. 
A year ago, we created for the first 
time an infectious disease fund—our 
colleague in the House, TOM COLE, was 
one of the major proponents of this—to 
let the Health and Human Services 
people have access to money imme-
diately. Because of that, they had $105 
million that they wouldn’t have pre-
viously had to be able to spend imme-
diately to help contain this problem, 
where it can be contained, to bring 
Americans 
back 
here, 
particularly 
from China, and to keep them in a 
known location for the 14-day incuba-
tion period to see if anything hap-
pened. All of that was possible because 
we had given them the flexibility that 
they hadn’t had before. 
The first-line-of-defense funding has 
been there. We are now moving toward 
a conclusion of what we can do to 
make more money available for a vac-
cine. A vaccine takes a while. We are 
not going to have a vaccine for a while. 
We are going to be continuing to talk 
to Dr. Fauci and his team about this. 
We are working with experts at what is 
called BARDA, or the Biomedical Ad-
vanced Research and Development Au-
thority, to move those vaccines quick-
ly. But even if we had a vaccine in 18 
months, that would be the U.S. world 
record to develop a vaccine here with 
the safety that we would think it 
would need to have so that anybody 
could take a vaccine and, with that 
vaccine, this particular virus would 
likely be dealt with. 
So there is no treatment right now. 
There is no cure right now. The treat-
ment is to handle these issues in the 
way that we can in a public health sys-
tem that has been built over decades. 
There are 50 States and the District of 
Columbia, and all have local public 
health providers. We are going to have 
new money available to work with 
them, but, again, the preparedness 
money that they have had for the last 
5 years should have been used in a 
way—and I believe was used in a way— 
that gets them all more ready to deal 
with this than they otherwise would 
have been. 
We need to continue so that the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention 
have what they need to improve the 
surveillance systems, the testing sys-
tems. I think we are going to find 
quickly that there will be a test that 
will be approved by the FDA that al-
lows people to check, in a number of lo-
cations, and have that process in a 
number of locations that tests to see if, 
in fact, you have what you thought was 
a worse-than-usual cold—or maybe you 
thought it was a not-worse-than-usual 
cold. Sometimes this particular disease 
doesn’t evidence that much happened 
at all. Because of that, I think there is

probably, at this point, a bigger num-
ber of people who we think would be a 
percentage of people who would have 
really 
negative 
consequences—even 
death—from this disease, rather than 
all the people who had it and didn’t 
know they had it. 
We have learned in the past, through 
outbreaks of a flu strain that we didn’t 
have a vaccine for, of Ebola, of Zika, 
that what we do to protect people in 
other countries winds up protecting 
people here. We have to be sure that we 
understand that a lot of our fate in this 
has been determined and will continue 
to be determined by what we do to first 
try to contain this virus and, secondly, 
to provide the money to be sure that, 
when we do have an outbreak, which 
has already begun in our country, it is 
an outbreak that is really held at the 
lowest possible level of people im-
pacted and, if you are infected by this 
disease, that you have the ability to 
work from home, to do other things. 
The hospital is not always the place to 
go. 
We are working with State and local 
health officials right now to see that 
that happens. The money that has been 
used, I think, has been used effectively. 
Clearly, we are trying to agree—be-
tween the House and the Senate and 
the 
administration—to 
exactly 
the 
right number. I would say that, at this 
point, the administration has been the 
most agreeable to whatever money we 
want to provide but, obviously, would 
like to have that money provided 
quickly. 
I feel confident we are going to have 
the resources to deal with this. I feel 
confident that this will be a problem 
that will not impact more people than 
would usually be impacted by some-
thing like the flu. Again, we need to 
prepare for the very worst and hope for 
the very best, but our job right now is 
to prepare for the worst things that 
could happen and have the funding 
available so that we don’t have to go 
through a couple of weeks again where 
an easy determination should have 
been reached. 
One thing we could have done is to 
have given the administration exactly 
the amount of money they asked for— 
we could have decided to spend it dif-
ferently—2 weeks ago and then get into 
a discussion of what we need next. 
That is not the course we decided to go 
down. 
We are trying to come up with an 
amount of money, it appears, that 
would get us through this entire inci-
dent with this virus, but it is time to 
get that done. Hopefully, we will see a 
bill filed later today and the House 
able to vote on that bill before they 
leave this week. Once that number is 
done, I think it will be seen as almost 
certain that the Senate will be able to 
deal with that bill and approve that 
number. 
We are going to move forward. I 
think, again, we are going to move for-
ward in a way that minimizes, as much 
as possible, the impact that this has on 
families and on individuals. 
Mr. President, I look forward to you 
and I both having a chance to learn 
more about this even today and to 
learn more as we move forward. The 
big thing we need to learn now is the 
amount of money we need to have to 
spend and how we allocate that money 
for a vaccine and other things.

f 
ADVANCED GEOTHERMAL INNOVA-
TION LEADERSHIP ACT OF 2019— 
Motion to Proceed—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
the bill before us supports clean energy 
and emerging technologies, so this is 
the perfect opportunity to update an 
outdated aspect related to a legacy en-
ergy source. 
Senator UDALL of New Mexico and I 
have an amendment that will close a 
loophole in Federal energy policy. I 
want my colleagues to know—and I 
think they do—of my long support for 
renewable and alternative sources of 
energy, and so I agree with the aims of 
the Murkowski-Manchin Energy bill. 
The amendment Senator UDALL and I 
have introduced is the same as the bi-
partisan bill we introduced last week. 
The title of that bill is the Fair Return 
for Public Lands Act. This bill was in-
troduced 100 years to the date of the 
Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. 
This amendment would increase the 
royalty rates on Federal lands from 
12.5 percent to 18.75 percent. Everybody 
here knows that a royalty is what the 
oil company will pay to a mineral 
owner—in this case, the mineral owner 
is the American taxpayer—and that 
royalty is paid for the right to extract 
oil and natural gas from the lands of 
the United States. The legislation mod-
ernizes the public lands leasing system, 
and it does this for the first time since 
royalty rates were set in 1920. 
The legislation increases both the 
share of royalties taxpayers receive 
from public lands leasing as well as the 
rental rates. The new rental rate we 
are offering in this amendment reflects 
the current fair market value, while 
the bill also establishes minimum bid-
ding standards to lease public lands 
that will stay in line with inflation. 
This bill is a simple fix by making Fed-
eral leasing rates the same whether 
you are on land or offshore. 
The royalty rate the bill offers is 
very comparable to what current leases 
are for oil-producing States on their 
State-owned land. We use the State of 
Texas as an example. Texas charges a 
25-percent royalty on its State lands, 
while States in the Rocky Mountain 
West charge royalties that are some-
where between 16–2⁄3 percent and 183⁄4 
percent. The royalty rate on Federal 
public lands is more than one-third 
lower, at 121⁄2
percent; hence our 
amendment—the same as our bill—up-
dating this and bringing more parity 
between State rates and Federal rates 
and, of course, absolute parity with off-
shore drilling. 
The current regulatory system al-
lows companies to get a sweetheart 
deal on Federal public lands. Senator 
UDALL and I are asking our colleagues 
to fix this for the American people. 
According to studies done by the 
Congressional Budget Office and the 
Government 
Accountability 
Office, 
modernizing public lands royalty rates 
for oil and gas could increase Federal 
revenues by as much as $200 million 
over the next decade and do it with lit-
tle to no impact on production. 
It is time—hence our amendment— 
for my colleagues in Congress to end 
this oil company loophole and bring oil 
leasing into the 21st century. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today as a Senator as 
well as a physician. I want to do this to 
reassure the American people that we 
are doing everything possible to com-
bat and contain the coronavirus. Ac-
cording to Johns Hopkins University, a 
well-known medical institution, we 
here in the United States are the most 
prepared Nation on the face of the 
Earth to protect ourselves in terms of 
preparation for an infectious disease 
like the coronavirus. 
Nevertheless, this virus is a global 
concern and is a problem with pan-
demic potential. We know the outbreak 
started in China. It goes without say-
ing that we are deeply saddened by the 
loss of life there, as well as here and 
around the world. We are concerned 
about those currently suffering from 
the virus. Our focus continues to be on 
protecting the health and the well- 
being and the safety of the American 
people. That is where we need to focus. 
Notably, President Trump’s early 
travel restrictions on China have actu-
ally helped slow the spread of the 
virus. He has since expanded these re-
strictions. The President, I believe, has 
acted swiftly, boldly, and decisively to 
contain the virus and to keep Ameri-
cans safe. Still, this country is not a 
hermetically sealed bubble. It will 
never be—can’t be. We are likely to see 
more cases here in the days and weeks 
ahead.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1281 
March 3, 2020 
We all must be prepared, and we 
must stay vigilant. Be assured, the 
Trump administration is fully engaged 
in responding to this virus. The United 
States has the best public health sys-
tem in the world, and we have a plan in 
place to combat the coronavirus. Our 
public health experts are working to 
identify and isolate the virus, as well 
as to produce a vaccine. 
The fastest you can ever produce a 
vaccine is several years. We seem to be 
moving faster than that with regard to 
coronavirus. We have seen develop-
ment, but even though it is moving 
faster than ever, it will still take a 
minimum of a year and 6 months to 
have a vaccine available and produced 
at a level that could actually impact 
the population of the country. Since it 
is a new virus, a new vaccine needs to 
be developed. The Vice President said 
over the weekend that we expect to 
have a vaccine available sometime 
next year, and I agree. 
Meanwhile, our strategy for testing, 
for isolation, and for quarantines right 
now is helping to lower the risks. Years 
ago, we created an infectious disease 
rapid response team. The goal was to 
make sure that we were ready if the 
time would come, and the time has now 
come. Test kits are becoming more 
widely available for States and com-
munities. We heard today over the 
noon hour that they are expecting to 
have enough test kits available around 
the country so that, over the next 
week, we can test a million people. We 
are going to continue to use every 
available tool we can in this fight. 
The White House has created a 
Coronavirus Task Force led by Vice 
President PENCE. The effort is headed 
by top officials at the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and the National Insti-
tutes of Health. I had a chance to visit 
with a number of them today, specifi-
cally 
the 
infectious 
disease 
group 
through the NIH. We have had a num-
ber of briefings through the Centers for 
Disease Control. We recently had a 
briefing by Dr. Anne Schuchat, the 
head of the Centers for Disease Control 
in the area helping with our efforts on 
coronavirus. As she has said, ‘‘Our ag-
gressive containment strategy here in 
the United States has been working 
and is responsible for the low level of 
cases that we have so far.’’ Officials at 
the CDC and the National Institutes of 
Health are coordinating with other 
Federal officials, and they tend to be 
working around the clock. 
The administration is making sure 
that State and local officials have all 
of the resources they need to respond. 
Dr. Schuchat said that our healthcare 
system, our businesses, our commu-
nities, and our schools all have action 
plans. 
Senators have had a number of brief-
ings from officials at the Centers for 
Disease Control and the National Insti-
tutes of Health. They are working on 
ways to identify the virus and test for 
the virus and ways to treat people who 
are infected by the virus. They are 
working on quarantines and on a vac-
cine. That is what they should be 
doing. This is a massive, nationwide 
undertaking. 
At every meeting—and I have been 
going to meetings on this since it was 
first noted around the beginning of the 
year. We know about the issue in 
China. People now know about the doc-
tor who tried to get the word out to the 
world—who was the first to notice this 
specific new virus, the coronavirus. He 
was reprimanded by the Chinese for 
trying to do what he learned to do as a 
doctor, which was to share medical 
knowledge and information to try to 
get ahead of a disease that is pro-
gressing. He was reprimanded by the 
Chinese Government, and he has subse-
quently died of the disease. 
There are a number of us—and it is 
bipartisan—who would go as Senators 
to briefings. We have been going to 
briefings since the time of the im-
peachment. We would have impeach-
ment in the afternoon and discussions 
about coronavirus in the morning. 
There has been a focus on this probably 
longer than most members around the 
country had been focused on it. At 
every meeting, we would ask the mem-
bers of the Centers for Disease Control 
and National Institutes of Health: Do 
you have the funds you need for the 
things you need to do right now? At all 
of those meetings, they said: Yes, we 
have all we need. 
Now things have changed. They say 
they need additional funds, and they 
are right. We agree they need more 
funds for testing, treatment, and vac-
cine development. It is appropriate 
that Congress appropriate that money. 
Congress must act quickly and deci-
sively in passing a bipartisan emer-
gency funding bill. Both parties agree 
this effort has to be fully funded. We 
know the initial numbers discussed 
were only a starting point. We don’t 
know what the total number is going 
to be, but the team is going to con-
tinue to have all the funds they need to 
deal with this disease. 
I find it very disturbing to see Demo-
crats, especially those running for 
President, politicizing the issue. This 
is a headline in yesterday’s New York 
Times: ‘‘Democrats Hit Trump On 
Virus.’’ They are talking about the 
Presidential candidates running for 
President, attacking President Trump 
on the virus. 
The coronavirus is a deadly disease. 
It is not a political tool to try to tar 
and feather President Trump. We need 
to be working on this together. This 
should not be about Democratic can-
didates trying to defeat President 
Trump 
but 
about 
defeating 
the 
coronavirus. That is what we ought to 
be focusing on. 
As a doctor, my focus is on the 
health of the American people. My ad-
vice for those who may be watching is 
the same commonsense advice you 
would take if you were saying ‘‘I want 
to avoid getting the flu during flu sea-
son,’’ and it is flu season as well. Cover 
your mouth when you cough. Wash 
your hands frequently. If you are sick, 
stay home. Those are the kinds of com-
monsense things people can do at 
home, not just to prevent the flu but 
also to protect themselves against the 
coronavirus. 
There is no reason for lots of anxiety 
or for panic. As a nation, we are in the 
right position to deal with the chal-
lenge we face. This administration will 
continue to do everything in its power 
to keep America and Americans safe. 
Now it is time for Congress to do its 
part—to pass the emergency legislation 
and get it to the President’s desk. 
Thankfully, we are the most prepared 
Nation to face this challenge. We have 
harnessed all of the American energy 
and ingenuity and expertise we need 
for this fight. The key is for all of us to 
remain engaged and to remain vigilant. 
As a doctor, I am confident that we 
will be able to succeed together. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
S. 2657 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President and fellow 
colleagues, I come to the floor today to 
talk about the American Energy Inno-
vation Act, which is here before the 
Senate and which we are considering 
this week. 
America’s 
energy 
landscape 
has 
changed dramatically since the last 
major Energy bill was enacted by Con-
gress more than a decade ago. It is 
time to update our outdated energy 
policy 
to 
reflect 
today’s 
realities, 
goals, and challenges in the energy sec-
tor. 
The American Energy Innovation 
Act—the business before the Senate 
today—is the cumulation of more than 
a year of hearings, business meetings, 
and negotiations in the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee. I com-
mend Chairman MURKOWSKI and Rank-
ing Member MANCHIN for their leader-
ship and all of us on the committee in 
bringing this strong, bipartisan, ‘‘all of 
the above’’ energy package to the floor. 
Included in this legislation are a 
number of provisions I have proposed 
that will benefit Idaho and the Nation. 
First, the bill appropriately recog-
nizes the importance of having a strong 
domestic nuclear industry. I represent 
not just one of the Department of En-
ergy’s National Laboratories, but I rep-
resent the Nation’s flagship nuclear en-
ergy laboratory, the Idaho National 
Lab. 
Nuclear power is the Nation’s largest 
source of reliable, carbon-free energy. 
To date, nuclear powerplants have pri-
marily served one purpose—to produce 
electricity—but 
we 
are 
discovering

S1282 
March 3, 2020 
through the work at the Idaho Na-
tional Lab that this is only the tip of 
the iceberg as far as the work a nuclear 
reactor could do. 
The INL and the Department of En-
ergy are currently working to dem-
onstrate that nuclear reactors can be 
adapted to produce other products like 
hydrogen, steam, and, importantly, 
heat. 
To 
accelerate 
this 
research, 
Ranking Member MANCHIN and I intro-
duced the Integrated Energy Systems 
Act to help improve the long-term 
competitiveness of our current fleet of 
nuclear reactors. That bill is included 
in the larger bill we have before us. 
While we must keep our existing fleet 
of reactors online, we must also usher 
in the next generation of advanced nu-
clear reactor designs. This is particu-
larly exciting at this point in time. 
The bipartisan Nuclear Energy Leader-
ship Act will address key supply chain 
and other challenges associated with 
developing small, modular, micro, and 
other advanced designs. This act is also 
included in the larger bill before us 
today. That bill, NELA, will enable the 
Federal Government to partner with 
the private sector to demonstrate and 
commercialize these technologies, and 
the INL’s National Reactor Innovation 
Center will play a key role in making 
these designs a reality. 
When looking toward a clean, reli-
able, and secure energy future, the im-
portance of rare-earth minerals cannot 
be overstated. In Idaho, we have the 
Nation’s only significant domestic de-
posit of cobalt—a mineral that is vital 
for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and 
military hardware. Yet, instead of min-
ing and processing this mineral in the 
United States, we import our supply 
from China. 
Cobalt is just one of many minerals 
the United States relies on imports for. 
We need to start prioritizing domestic 
supply and processing our critical min-
erals for our energy and domestic secu-
rity future. I appreciate that we have 
also included this act in the big bill 
that is in front of us. This is the Amer-
ican Mineral Security Act, and it 
prioritizes our energy independence. 
I am also pleased that the key provi-
sions of my bill, the Enhancing Geo-
thermal Production on Federal Lands 
Act, were also included. That act is in-
cluded in the larger bill. 
Idaho has long been a world leader in 
the development of geothermal tech-
nologies. In fact, the Idaho State Cap-
ital Building is the only State capital 
in the United States that is heated 
solely with geothermal energy. 
There is significant potential to ex-
pand this renewable energy in Idaho 
and indeed across the Western United 
States, and most of this potential ex-
ists on federally managed lands. Unfor-
tunately, developers looking to harness 
this resource on Federal lands must 
navigate a labyrinth of regulations. 
The provisions in this bill will unleash 
our Nation’s vast geothermal resources 
by making the current permitting re-
view process more efficient, cost-effec-
tive, predictable, and, importantly, 
take a shorter period of time. 
Lastly, I am proud that this legisla-
tion contains language from the PRO-
TECT Act that will modernize our elec-
tric grid and enhance cyber security ef-
forts. I don’t need to spend any time on 
cyber security. It is important for our 
electric grid. It is one of the favorite 
targets of terrorists around the world. 
They usually go through cyber secu-
rity. 
The worldwide adoption of digital au-
tomation technology has created great 
benefits, but it also introduces signifi-
cant cyber vulnerabilities to critical 
energy infrastructure. I am proud that 
the solutions to many of these chal-
lenges are being developed at the Idaho 
National Laboratory, which is the 
world leader in critical infrastructure, 
control systems, and security research 
in those areas. 
Protecting our electric grid is one of 
the most pressing security challenges, 
and we must incentivize the energy 
sector to deploy the most advanced 
cyber security technologies. 
The additional authorities and tools 
in these bills are critical to both our 
energy and national security, and I am 
committed—hopefully along with all of 
my colleagues here in the Senate—to 
seeing those matters cross the finish 
line in this important act, which fi-
nally reaches us at this critical time. 
With that, I will yield the floor to my 
distinguished colleague from New Mex-
ico. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, thank 
you for the recognition. 
Let me begin today by commending 
the efforts of Senators MURKOWSKI and 
MANCHIN for working across the aisle 
to bring an energy bill to the floor. 
This bill has positive initiatives— 
promoting energy efficiency, modern-
izing the electric grid, and research 
funding for clean energy—but the full 
Senate deserves a chance to be heard 
on the important issues at stake with 
this bill; namely, energy. 
Most importantly, we must take real 
action on climate change and address a 
problematic provision in this bill to 
limit environmental reviews of massive 
and potentially toxic mining projects. 
Everywhere we look, we are experi-
encing the devastating effects of cli-
mate change—whether they are hurri-
canes along the southeastern coasts, 
flooding in the Midwest, drought in the 
Southwest, or out-of-control wildfires 
in California—and we are careening too 
close to climate change tipping points 
that scientists warn will doom the 
planet. 
The bill before us does not set targets 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 
the levels required to meet global tar-
gets or transition us to a clean energy 
economy, which is where we need to 
head, and we need to be heading there 
fast. A few things would dramatically 
improve this bill’s climate impact. 
First, we need to add clean energy 
tax incentives. Clean energy tax incen-
tives are one of the most effective tools 
we have in our toolbox to increase re-
newable power sources like wind and 
solar and the energy storage tech-
nology that enables them to work as a 
baseload power. 
Second, we should put commonsense 
limits on one of the worst greenhouse 
gases—methane. The U.S. oil and gas 
boom means that we are emitting 13 
million metric tons of methane every 
year. That is 60 percent more than EPA 
estimates. Methane is 84 times more 
powerful than CO2 as a greenhouse gas 
in the short term. 
Industry says they want to control 
methane pollution. They were prepared 
to live with limits on public lands in a 
2016 rule from the Bureau of Land Man-
agement. In 2017, the Senate rejected 
an attempt to repeal that rule on a bi-
partisan basis. But the Trump adminis-
tration eliminated the rule due to lob-
bying by the worst polluters in the in-
dustry. We should restore that rule, 
and I have filed an amendment to do so 
immediately. 
We should also act to phase out HFCs 
and include a strong energy efficiency 
program for buildings. Then this bill 
could make a small but meaningful 
contribution to the climate change 
fight. 
Within the confines of this bill, there 
is a problematic and anti-environ-
mental section that deserves serious 
scrutiny. I am talking about the con-
troversial American Mineral Security 
Act—a bill that saw significant opposi-
tion in the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee. Including this 
bill in this package is problematic be-
cause it would ‘‘streamline’’ the Fed-
eral permitting process for hard rock 
mining. 
Streamlining 
the 
approval 
process means arbitrary deadlines and 
reducing public input on massive min-
ing projects that could cause further 
environmental destruction on public 
lands. 
Mining is a messy business. Surface 
mining ravages the earth. Heap leach 
mining produces what is called acid 
mine drainage that spews a mix of 
acidic water and heavy metals into 
streams 
and 
contaminates 
ground-
water. An astounding 40 percent of 
western headwaters are contaminated 
by mine runoff. Those headwaters are 
where we get our drinking water. 
There are two controversial mine 
proposals in New Mexico right now— 
the Terrero Mine in the Pecos and the 
Copper Flat Mine near Hillsboro, NM. 
Both of these mines are of significant 
concern to local farmers, ranchers, 
Tribes, and residents who are worried 
about water pollution. 
Under this provision, almost any-
thing could be labeled a ‘‘critical min-
eral.’’ Mining permits will get pushed 
through, while limiting local commu-
nity input. I am strongly supporting an 
amendment from Senator STABENOW to 
strike this provision. 
The proponents of this critical min-
erals bill have some valid points. Of 
course we need certain metals for our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1283 
March 3, 2020 
economy, including a clean energy 
economy, but we cannot forget that 
the mining industry has gotten one of 
the biggest free rides on the back of 
the taxpayer in American history, all 
the while leaving the taxpayer holding 
the bag for their toxic legacy. 
Hard rock mining on Federal lands is 
governed by the General Mining Act of 
1872—that is right, 1872—a 148-year-old 
law. President Ulysses S. Grant signed 
it to help settle the West and to spur 
economic development. Still in effect 
today, the act allows mining compa-
nies to mine gold, silver, copper, ura-
nium, and other precious metals on 
Federal lands without paying one dime 
in royalties—not one dime. That is in 
sharp contrast to coal and oil and gas 
companies that pay billions in royal-
ties every year for the right to extract 
resources—resources owned by the pub-
lic and which are coming off public 
lands. The current rate paid by coal, 
oil, and gas is 12.5 percent. These same 
mining companies often pay royalties 
of similar payments when they operate 
overseas but not here in the United 
States. 
Since 1872, mining companies have 
taken $300 billion—that is billion with 
a ‘‘b’’—from public lands. The U.S. 
Government Accountability Office esti-
mated that in 2010 alone hardrock min-
ing earned $6.4 billion from public 
lands. That would have yielded $800 
million per year for the American tax-
payer if mining were treated the same 
as coal, oil, and gas. 
The shocking fact is, foreign-owned 
companies are often the beneficiaries. 
For example, 83 percent of the compa-
nies that mine or explore for uranium 
in the United States are foreign owned; 
64 percent of the companies that 
produce gold are foreign owned. 
The out-of-date mining law not only 
shortchanges 
taxpayers; 
it 
short-
changes the environment. The same in-
dustry that seeks permitting relief 
from Congress today does nothing to 
pay for cleanup at the tens of thou-
sands of abandoned mines scarring our 
public lands. The GAO estimates that 
there are 33,000 abandoned mines across 
the West that are degrading the envi-
ronment. One study found that 20,000 
gallons per day of toxic water from 43 
abandoned mine sites are polluting 
streams, ponds, and groundwater. 
What is wrong with these numbers? 
The American taxpayer is stuck with 
the bill, and the local and regional 
communities are stuck with the dev-
astating 
environmental 
and 
public 
health impacts. 
Now, witness this: the Gold King 
Mine that gushed 3 million gallons—3 
million gallons—of this toxic yellow 
stew into the Animas and San Juan 
Rivers and across my home State of 
New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, 
and the Navajo Nation. It has been 4 
years since this spill, and the States, 
Tribes, and local communities have 
still not been fully reimbursed. This 
was a normal river in the West that 
looked clean and pristine. Here it is, 
this toxic stew—this yellowish, toxic 
stew—that ran for a number of days. 
The right to mine on Federal lands 
royalty-free maybe made sense 150 
years ago. A free ride makes no sense 
now. It is a sweetheart deal for the 
mining companies that can’t be justi-
fied by today’s fiscal or environmental 
realities. The old joke in the West is 
that the mining company gets the gold, 
and the American people get the 
shaft—and that is literally true. 
My amendment to reform the 1872 
mining law that Senators HEINRICH and 
BENNET are cosponsoring ends this free 
ride by doing two simple things: It sets 
a royalty rate between 5 and 8 percent 
on mining on Federal lands, the public 
lands, and provides for cleanup of aban-
doned mines paid for by royalties and 
an abandoned mine reclamation fee of 1 
to 3 percent. 
The House Committee on Natural Re-
sources approved broad mining reform 
legislation last year. This bill could be 
coming to the House floor soon and is 
probably headed in our direction over 
here at the Senate. Mining reform is 
decades and decades overdue. It is only 
fair to address this injustice before we 
give mining companies new perks, even 
if they can be justified, and enacting a 
royalty 
and 
reclamation 
fee 
is 
a 
healthy start on that process. 
I thank, again, Senators MURKOWSKI 
and MANCHIN for their work. I hope we 
can return to the regular order, to the 
idea that we are going to have a bill on 
the floor and that we can have amend-
ments and have the process work as it 
normally does and improve the bill on 
these important points. If we cannot, I 
think the path for this bill becomes 
much harder. 
Now, on another subject before I con-
clude, I want to voice my support for 
the remarks Senator GRASSLEY gave 
earlier today on the oil and gas royal-
ties. We filed an amendment together, 
based on our bill, to update those roy-
alties and other leasing items for the 
first time in 100 years. It is a long over-
due topic, and I hope to see increasing 
bipartisan support in the near future. 
We have a historic oil boom in this 
country, much of which is using public 
lands, and the public has a right to see 
a fair value for those resources. 
We also have a large and growing 
budget deficit and a major climate 
change problem. Bringing oil and gas 
royalties into the 21st century would 
be a bipartisan win on all of those 
fronts. 
I yield the floor. I see my good friend, 
the Senator from Tennessee, is here. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
TENNESSEE 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
am on the floor to speak about the 
coronavirus, but first let me express to 
the families in Tennessee my heartfelt 
concern for them as the result of a tor-
nado that swept through Middle Ten-
nessee last night while people were 
sleeping. 
The number of deaths is 22 so far in 
Nashville, and in Wilson, Putnam, and 
Benton Counties. I have seen floods, 
and I have seen fires. The damage they 
cause is terrible, but there is nothing 
quite like seeing what a tornado can 
do. It can arrive in 30 seconds or 1 
minute and be gone and leave behind it 
death and buildings laid flat to the 
ground. I can’t imagine what it must 
be like for that to happen at 1 in the 
morning when nobody knows it is com-
ing. 
I will be in Tennessee on Friday when 
the Senate concludes its business this 
week and will be visiting those areas. 
Our office has been in touch with may-
ors in all of the counties and commu-
nities affected. Senator BLACKBURN and 
I are working together, along with the 
rest of the Tennessee delegation in the 
House, to make certain that we give 
full Federal support to Governor Lee. 
The President talked to Governor Lee 
today, and, as a result of that call, the 
White House put out a statement indi-
cating the President may be in Ten-
nessee on Friday. That would be wel-
comed as well. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, let me speak for a mo-
ment about the coronavirus. The coun-
try was transfixed by the impeachment 
process for about a month, and now 
they are transfixed by the coronavirus, 
but this is different. This is personal. 
This could affect each of us. When I am 
home—and I am sure when the Pre-
siding Officer is home—there are lots 
of questions about the coronavirus. 
I want to speak this morning about a 
hearing that we had in the Senate’s 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee that was reassuring 
to me and, I think, to the Democrats as 
well as the Republicans there. It was 
reassuring because we had four re-
spected professionals from the govern-
ment with broad experience in dealing 
with public health crises—whether it is 
anthrax, Ebola, or other coronaviruses. 
We have had all of that in the United 
States in the last 25 years, and we have 
dealt with that. 
At the end of the hearing, Senator 
MURRAY, the ranking Democrat on the 
committee, and I, and the Democrats 
on committee who aren’t bashful, and 
the Republicans on committee who 
aren’t bashful, but I think I can speak 
for them in saying those four profes-
sionals, many of whom have worked for 
25 or 30 years in terms of helping our 
country deal with health crises, con-
tinue to earn our respect. We believe 
what they tell us, and they promised to 
tell us the truth. 
When I saw the Vice President earlier 
today, I said to him: Mr. Vice Presi-
dent, I am glad that you have been 
placed in charge of this. As a former 
Governor, I think it makes sense to 
place a Vice President—that indicates 
the highest level of attention—and a 
former Governor, someone who is ac-
customed to working with States and 
local governments, in charge of a prob-
lem that is going to be solved pri-
marily by our exceptional State and 
local public health systems. So I think

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1284 
March 3, 2020 
you are exactly the right person to be 
in charge. 
My advice to him was to let the pro-
fessionals do the talking because peo-
ple believe them. If the President and 
the Vice President give their view, 
they are entitled to do it, but someone 
will think they are simply justifying 
what they are doing. If the Democrats, 
on the other hand, say something 
about the coronavirus response, some-
one will think, well, they are just criti-
cizing President Trump. 
But if Dr. Fauci, for example, who for 
over 35 years—since 1984, which is a 
long 
time, 
working 
for 
President 
Reagan, President H. W. Bush, Presi-
dent Clinton, President George W. 
Bush, President Obama, and President 
Trump; working on HIV/AIDS; working 
on anthrax; working on two Ebola 
epidemics—if Dr. Fauci answers a ques-
tion and tells us something, we believe 
that. What we need is accurate infor-
mation for the American people about 
exactly where we stand with this crisis 
and what we need to do in Congress 
that we have not already done. 
So, in the next few minutes, I would 
like to talk about what we heard this 
morning and to compliment those four 
professionals who were there: 
Dr. Anne Schuchat, is the Principal 
Deputy Director of the Centers for Dis-
ease Control. She has had 30 years 
working with infectious diseases, most 
of that time with the CDC. 
Dr. Fauci I just described, working 
with six Presidents. I believe he has 
virtually universal respect here for 
truth-telling and competence. 
Dr. Robert Kadlec. He is the Assist-
ant Secretary for Preparedness and Re-
sponse at the Department of Health 
and Human Services. He used to advise 
the Department of Defense, and then 
he helped Senator BURR to write the 
legislation that set up the agency that 
helps us be better prepared to deal with 
such health crises as we might experi-
ence here. 
Then Dr. Stephen Hahn. He is the 
newest one of the four in terms of com-
ing to the government, but he has been 
the head of the MD Anderson Cancer 
Center in Texas, one of the most re-
spected institutions in the world. 
So those are the professionals that 
we heard this morning. 
Now, what did we hear? We heard 
that the coronavirus is alarming in 
terms of what is happening around the 
world. There are 90,000 cases or more 
and 3,000 deaths. All of this has hap-
pened in the last 2, 21⁄2 months, so far 
as we know. 
What has happened at home? What 
has happened at home here in the 
United States is that we have slightly 
more than 100 cases that are detected. 
About half of those are Americans who 
were traveling and had to be brought 
home and were repatriated, as we say, 
and the other half have been detected 
here. Unfortunately, we have had six 
deaths. 
It is fair to say that citizens in the 
United States are at low risk for infec-
tion from the coronavirus, but you 
don’t have to take my word for it. 
Take the word of the professionals who 
testified this morning before the Sen-
ate’s Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions Committee or take the words 
of what the New York Times said a 
couple of days ago on its front page in 
the Sunday newspaper in describing 
the situation in the United States. 
Here is what the Times said: ‘‘Much 
about the coronavirus remains unclear, 
and it is far from certain that the out-
break will reach severe proportions in 
the United States or affect many re-
gions at once.’’ Continuing, the New 
York Times: ‘‘With its top-notch sci-
entists, modern hospitals and sprawl-
ing public health infrastructure, most 
experts agree, the United States is 
among the countries best prepared to 
prevent or manage such an epidemic.’’ 
That is the New York Times’ front 
page assessment 2 days ago. 
Now, in addition to the possible ef-
fect on the lives of Americans, this 
problem can disrupt our economy. 
Twenty percent of what we import, ac-
cording to our Trade Representative, 
comes from China. So we are not just 
talking about medicines or masks. We 
are talking about parts of cars or 
chemicals, such as those for Eastman 
Chemical in East Tennessee, which em-
ploys thousands of people. It can cause 
our economy to slow down and econo-
mies in the rest of the world to slow 
down. 
The purpose of our hearing this 
morning was, first, to get an idea of 
what Americans needed to know about 
the coronavirus. We learned some 
things. We learned that, based on the 
data that we have and that has been re-
ceived just in the last couple of days 
from China, we haven’t seen many chil-
dren infected by the coronavirus. They 
may be, but the average age of the peo-
ple who seem to be infected by it is 50, 
and the people who get the sickest are 
people who are already sick. 
The second thing we have learned 
seems so simple it doesn’t seem to be 
true. What can we do about the 
coronavirus? How can we keep from 
getting it? Wash your hands. Wash 
your hands. I find myself now doing it 
a few more times a day, and I didn’t 
used to do it as often. 
Our hands pick up germs from our 
cell phones or from the rails we touch 
or from the hands we shake or from the 
seats in front of us on the airplane. 
Then what do we do? We put our hands 
on our face many more times an hour 
than most people are aware. That is 
the single biggest way this spreads. 
Wash your hands. That is what Dr. 
Fauci says—the professional who has 
been working on these diseases for dec-
ades. 
Here is something else we learned to 
put the coronavirus into context. We 
are just past the peak of the flu season. 
Most of us know about the flu. We have 
a vaccine for the flu—not for the 
coronavirus, but for the flu—and most 
of us take it. But there are tens of mil-
lions of us who will get the flu this flu 
season. Fifty thousand Americans, on 
average, die from the flu each year— 
50,000 Americans. It might be 30,000 one 
year and might be 70,000 in a very bad 
year. But there are a lot of people who 
die from the flu. 
The flu is a respiratory disease, just 
like the coronavirus is a respiratory 
disease. It is a different respiratory dis-
ease, but the symptoms are similar: 
fever and a cough. 
We also learned this morning from 
the professionals who told us this: For 
80 percent of the people who are in-
fected with the coronavirus, it is a fair-
ly mild experience. Twenty percent— 
mainly older people—are sicker, and 
they are the ones who need the atten-
tion. 
Those are some of the things we 
learned this morning from the profes-
sionals who have been working on 
epidemics or potential epidemics for a 
long time. 
What should we do about it? Let’s 
start with what we have done about it. 
I think it is important for the Amer-
ican people to know that. Let’s start 
with Congress. This is not our first 
rodeo, so to speak. We have faced pub-
lic health threats for the last 20 years. 
There are Members of Congress and 
staff who were here during the anthrax 
attack in 2001, nearly 20 years ago. In 
2003, we saw SARS. That was another 
type of coronavirus. Then, in 2009, the 
flu pandemic killed more than 150,000 
people around the world. Then there 
were the Ebola outbreaks in 2014 and 
2018. 
After every one of those incidents, 
Congress, working with Democratic 
and Republican Presidents, tried to 
prepare the Federal Government to be 
ready for the next problem. 
After anthrax, we created Project 
BioShield to develop and stockpile new 
treatments and vaccines. After the 2003 
SARS outbreak, in 2006, Congress cre-
ated the Pandemic and All-Hazards 
Preparedness Act. Senator BURR
of 
North Carolina was the principal au-
thor. It guides the government on how 
to respond to public health emer-
gencies, and it created a fund the gov-
ernment can use to respond quickly to 
problems that come up. 
Last year, Congress provided more 
than $4 billion for public health and 
preparedness programs. When a crisis 
occurs, like this coronavirus—all of 
which has happened since the first of 
the year, maybe a little since Decem-
ber, but mostly since the first of the 
year—money is often needed quickly, 
so Congress created a couple of funds 
the agencies can take money from. One 
of them is the Rapid Response Fund. 
Secretary Azar has already taken $105 
million 
from 
that 
fund 
for 
this 
healthcare issue. We have given him 
the authority to take another $136 mil-
lion, which he has done. 
The President has recommended $2.5 
billion more. Congress, with many dif-
ferent suggestions having been made,

March 3, 2020 
this week is likely to approve addi-
tional funding to do whatever our pro-
fessionals tell us needs to be done to 
keep us safe and help protect our econ-
omy. 
In addition to what Congress has 
done, our various Presidents have done 
even more. For example, President 
Obama, if you will remember, sent our 
military to Africa to deal with the 
Ebola outbreak before it came here. 
That was quite an extraordinary ac-
tion. President George W. Bush sent 
Centers for Disease Control scientists 
around the world to help with the 
SARS epidemic. In the same way, 
President Trump has done something 
that hasn’t been done in this country 
for over 50 years. At a time when there 
were only six confirmed cases of 
coronavirus in the United States, this 
administration announced they would 
quarantine Americans who may have 
been exposed to the virus while in 
China and would not allow foreign na-
tionals who traveled to China in the 
last 14 days to enter the United States, 
and warned Americans not to travel to 
China and, more recently, to think 
more carefully about traveling to parts 
of Italy or South Korea. The President 
added Iran to these travel restrictions 
more recently. 
Dr. Fauci, the National Institutes of 
Health professional whom we heard 
from this morning, said that without 
those Executive actions, we would have 
many more cases right now. 
The third thing the administration 
has done is to develop a test to diag-
nose 
whether 
you 
have 
the 
coronavirus. We didn’t have that before 
because this is a new virus. The admin-
istration is rapidly working on that— 
not as fast as everyone would like, but 
fast, so far as I can tell. 
The FDA is working with 65 private 
sector test developers in addition to 
the 46 labs in 38 States who are using 
the Centers for Disease Control test. 
The goal is to have in place kits that 
will allow 1 million tests to be done 
shortly. 
As far as a vaccine, the professionals 
are working on a vaccine more rapidly 
than any vaccine ever before, but it 
still takes more than a year. However, 
the President met with drug manufac-
turers to see if existing treatments 
might be used earlier. Our National 
Laboratories have gotten involved as 
well. 
As we look at the impact of the 
coronavirus, we think mostly about 
our own health, but we also see other 
issues, such as the effect on our econ-
omy. 13 percent of the facilities that 
make active ingredients for drugs are 
in China. We need to take a look at 
that. 
I would like to conclude where I 
started. People ask me: What can we do 
about the coronavirus? The answer is 
as simple as wash your hands, drink a 
lot of water, and isolate yourself if you 
feel sick. If you have a fever and a 
cough, call your doctor. Stay home, 
and don’t infect your neighbors. 
Are we going to be able to contain 
the coronavirus in the United States? I 
go back to what the New York Times 
said on its front page on Sunday. We 
have experienced dealing with new dis-
eases in the United States. We have 
professionals who, for several decades 
through several administrations, both 
Democratic and Republican, have been 
successful in doing that. We have 
Presidents, both Democratic and Re-
publican, who have taken strong Exec-
utive action, including this one, to pro-
tect the American people. 
In short, while this is an alarming 
problem 
around 
the 
world—surely, 
more Americans will become infected— 
most experts agree that we are fortu-
nate that the United States is the 
country in the world with the sci-
entists, with the resources, and with 
the experience to do the best possible 
job of containing the spread of this 
virus. 
I yield the floor.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). The Senator from Vermont. 
55TH ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, 55 
years ago, a courageous band of civil 
rights activists, including the fearless 
JOHN LEWIS, began a march for what 
many of us considered a sacred right to 
vote. They marched from Selma to 
Montgomery, and they marched in the 
face of unspeakable violence. They 
shed their blood for access to the bal-
lot. While much has changed in the last 
55 years, this struggle for voting equal-
ity, and this march for progress, con-
tinues. 
On Sunday, I was inspired yet again 
by my hero, my dear friend, now-Con-
gressman JOHN LEWIS, who summoned 
depthless strength to lead thousands in 
commemorating the anniversary of 
Bloody Sunday. This was not merely a 
commemoration; it was a clarion call 
to action. Those of us who know the 
Congressman know he has been seri-
ously ill but has not given up the fight. 
In fact, Congressman LEWIS’s voice 
booming over the crowd reminded us 
all to ‘‘continue to fight . . . now more 
than ever.’’ 
‘‘I’m not going to give up,’’ he thun-
dered. ‘‘I’m not going to give in.’’ I am 
proud to stand with my dear friend, 
Congressman JOHN LEWIS. 
In the past several years, a number of 
States have done all they could to dis-
enfranchise tens of thousands of minor-
ity voters. Their tactics were often 
brazen and transparent. While these 
voter suppression schemes took many 
forms—from sweeping purges of voter 
rolls to arbitrary, new identification 
requirements—they all shared one pur-
pose and one purpose alone: making 
voting more difficult for minorities 
and the marginalized. As a Federal 
judge observed when he struck down 
one such State’s voter ID law, it sought 
to disenfranchise ‘‘African Americans 
with almost surgical precision.’’ 
Today, we are seeing a reprise of 
these efforts ahead of one of the most 
consequential elections in the history 
of our democracy. Those doing the sup-
pressions don’t even pretend to hide 
their intent. 
In November, a senior adviser to 
President Trump’s reelection campaign 
came right out and said the quiet part, 
but he said it out loud. He observed 
that ‘‘traditionally . . . Republicans 
[suppress] votes,’’ and then he pre-
dicted that voter suppression is ‘‘going 
to be a much bigger program, a much 
more aggressive program’’ in 2020. 
In May 2019, Tennessee enacted a dra-
conian law imposing criminal penalties 
against voter registration groups who 
submitted so-called deficient registra-
tion forms. In October 2019, Florida’s 
State legislature tried to undo a con-
stitutional 
amendment 
overwhelm-
ingly approved by Floridians to restore 
voting rights to former felons. This is 
something we take for granted in 
Vermont—that they can vote. These ef-
forts have thankfully been halted, at 
least temporarily, in the courts. There 
will be other States that attempt what 
Florida and Tennessee tried—or even 
worse. And those who value the sanc-
tity of the vote will be engaged in an 
endless war of Whac-A-Mole in the 
courts to stop these un-American ef-
forts to suppress the right to vote. 
Why have States been given such free 
rein to suppress the minority vote? It 
is because of the disastrous 2013 Su-
preme Court decision, Shelby County v. 
Holder. That gutted section 5 of the 
Voting Rights Act, which had been 
voted on by both Democrats and Re-
publicans. It gutted it. It crippled the 
Federal 
Government’s 
ability 
to 
proactively 
prevent 
discriminatory 
changes to State voting laws. 
In the wake of Shelby County, States 
have unleashed a torrent of voter sup-
pression schemes, some almost imme-
diately after the decision came down, 
knowing full well that the Federal 
Government can no longer serve as a 
shield against disenfranchisement. Our 
democracy depends on these changes— 
and changing now. The proliferation, 
the threats to the right to vote in the 
wake of Shelby County, makes it un-
mistakably clear that we need the full 
protections of the Voting Rights Act. 
That is exactly why, for years, I have 
championed, authored, and I have re-
introduced the Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. I reintroduced this legisla-
tion again in 2019. I note it is a bipar-
tisan bill. I should repeat this. It is a 
bipartisan bill. Republicans and Demo-
crats alike support it to restore section 
5 of the Voting Rights Act and improve 
and modernize that landmark legisla-
tion, and provide the Federal Govern-
ment with other critical tools to com-
bat this full-fledged assault on the 
franchise. 
A total of 47 Senators publicly stated 
they support this commonsense effort 
to protect the right to vote. Why don’t 
we bring it to a vote? If people want to 
continue these suppressions, let them 
vote that way. If they want to allow 
people to vote, let them vote that way. 
If the majority leader would simply let

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1286 
March 3, 2020 
it come to a vote—right now it is being 
stopped by one person. If the majority 
leader would simply let it come to a 
vote, it would pass. The House has al-
ready passed its companion version of 
my legislation. 
I find it offensive for those who claim 
this bipartisan, bicameral legislation is 
some kind of partisan power grab. In 
America, it is the governed who possess 
the power. Restoring their power is not 
partisan. Restoring their power is what 
it means to be a democracy. 
I say to my friend the majority lead-
er, to Senator MCCONNELL: All eyes are 
on you. Will he release the Voting 
Rights Advancement Act from his leg-
islative graveyard and do it before the 
elections? Will he simply allow an up- 
or-down vote on this legislation to re-
store the bipartisan Voting Rights Act 
of 1965? History is watching. 
As my hero and friend JOHN LEWIS 
powerfully reminded us this past Sun-
day, ‘‘We’ve got to make America bet-
ter for all of her people. . . . We’re one 
people, we’re one family.’’ I agree. The 
right to vote for all Americans is the 
beating heart of our form of govern-
ment. Indeed, it is the very right that 
gives democracy its name. Let us show 
the world we are deserving of that 
name. Let us show the world the con-
science of the Senate is that we will go 
forward and vote it—vote for it or vote 
against it but vote it. Don’t just keep 
it from coming to a vote. 
Unfortunately, when you keep it 
from coming to a vote, it looks too 
much like what we are trying to do to 
a lot of people, especially minorities in 
this country, is keep them from voting. 
We have Republicans and Democrats in 
this body. Let us vote up or down on 
this. Most importantly, as we do in my 
State of Vermont, we fight to make 
sure every Vermonter gets to vote no 
matter what their party is, no matter 
where they live, no matter who they 
are. Let’s see if we can do that for the 
rest of the country. We would be a bet-
ter country for it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
S. 2657 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of the American Energy Inno-
vation Act—a compilation of energy- 
related measures that has been re-
ported, with bipartisan support, by the 
Senate’s Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources. 
Let me start by recognizing the tre-
mendous efforts of the very committed 
and dedicated chairman of that com-
mittee, LISA MURKOWSKI, and of the 
ranking member, JOE
MANCHIN, and 
their work in bringing this comprehen-
sive energy package to the Senate 
floor. Under their leadership, the com-
mittee has worked very hard to craft a 
bipartisan package that seeks to lower 
energy costs for consumers, to diver-
sify our energy portfolio, and to facili-
tate and encourage the use of cleaner 
energy sources. 
The American Energy Innovation Act 
includes several bills that I either au-
thored or cosponsored, including the 
Better 
Energy 
Storage 
Technology 
Act, known as the BEST Act, which 
supports energy storage research and 
development; the Weatherization En-
hancement and Local Energy Effi-
ciency Investment and Accountability 
Act, which reauthorizes the Weather-
ization Assistance Program; the Wind 
Energy Research and Development Act, 
which supports targeted investments in 
wind energy; and the Energy Savings 
and Industrial Competitiveness Act, as 
well as the Streamlining Energy Effi-
ciency for Schools Act, which both pro-
mote energy efficiency. 
I am particularly pleased that this 
agreement includes legislation I au-
thored with Senator HEINRICH. It is 
what is known as the BEST Act, the 
Better 
Energy 
Storage 
Technology 
Act. This bipartisan bill would support 
energy storage research and develop-
ment, which would, in turn, advance 
the deployment of renewable energy. 
Federal investments in the research, 
development, and deployment of en-
ergy storage technologies would enable 
the expansion of renewable energy 
sources that are essential in combating 
climate change. 
Energy storage systems actually pro-
vide a wide range of benefits. First, 
these technologies increase the reli-
ability and resiliency of our electric 
grid by limiting potential disruptions. 
Energy storage allows for the better 
management of supply and demand on 
our Nation’s power grid. 
Second, this type of technology can 
decrease energy costs. In the State of 
Maine, the price of electricity can rise 
steeply during the coldest days of the 
year. In late 2017 and early 2018, very 
cold temperatures in New England led 
to higher energy costs that amounted 
to more than $1 billion being spent in 
the wholesale energy market in only 15 
days. 
The next generation of energy stor-
age technologies could also help to 
transform our grid, meaning that we 
would no longer need to generate more 
expensive power to meet demand dur-
ing the hottest and coldest days of the 
year. Instead, we could use more af-
fordable sources of energy that have 
been stored for later use. 
Finally, energy storage systems can 
allow for more intermittent renewable 
sources, such as wind or solar power, to 
be placed on the grid and to be used 
precisely when they are needed. Think 
of that. Right now, if the wind is not 
blowing, obviously we are not pro-
ducing wind energy. If the Sun is not 
shining, we are not producing solar- 
generated energy. Yet, if during those 
windy periods and on those sunny days 
we could figure out how to store the 
energy that is produced so that it may 
be released later for electricity on the 
grid, what a difference it would make. 
Off the coast of Maine, offshore wind 
turbines can produce electricity almost 
50 percent of the time due to our rel-
atively persistent offshore winds, but 
with next-generation energy storage 
technology, we could utilize this wind 
power closer to 100 percent of the time 
by storing the electricity that is pro-
duced so that it may be used when the 
wind is not blowing. That is why I am 
so excited about the potential for im-
proving 
our 
energy 
storage 
tech-
nologies. 
We all think of batteries. Certainly, 
coming up with better, more efficient 
batteries with which to store elec-
tricity is part of the answer, but there 
are other technologies that are going 
to be available if we make a concerted 
effort to devote resources to research 
and development and deployment. 
For these reasons, I am especially de-
lighted that the BEST Act was in-
cluded in this package, and I hope it 
will be enacted swiftly. 
Next, I would like to turn to a pro-
gram that is very important to many 
low-income families and seniors in the 
State of Maine, and that is the weath-
erization program. I thank Senators 
MURKOWSKI and MANCHIN for including 
the bill that I authored with Senators 
COONS, REED, and SHAHEEN that reau-
thorizes the Weatherization Assistance 
Program. 
Through my position on the Com-
mittee 
on 
Appropriations, 
I 
have 
worked with my colleagues to secure 
an increase of $51 million for weather-
ization assistance for fiscal year 2020. 
In fact, virtually every year, this is 
something on which I and the Senators 
whom I mentioned work together to 
achieve. Oftentimes, regrettably, the 
President’s budget eliminates the fund-
ing for the weatherization program, 
but with bipartisan support, the mem-
bers of the Committee on Appropria-
tions work hard to include it in the 
funding bills. One reason we do so is 
that, whether it is insulating them or 
replacing windows or installing heat 
pumps, weatherizing our houses pays 
off. In fact, on average, weatherization 
returns a 4 to 1 on the investment. 
Since 2010, the State of Maine has re-
ceived a little more than $22 million in 
funding, and it has been able to suc-
cessfully weatherize nearly 2,500 homes 
and rental units across the State. What 
a difference that has made to the fami-
lies who live in those homes and to the 
seniors who were once living in drafty 
homes, for their energy costs were 
much higher than they needed to be be-
cause their homes were not well insu-
lated. It also makes those homes a lot 
more comfortable for our seniors and 
low-income families. 
Encouraging the adoption of energy 
efficiency measures is one of the easi-
est, yet effective mechanisms for re-
ducing energy consumption, lessening

pollution, 
and 
ultimately 
saving 
money for families, businesses, com-
munities, and governments at all lev-
els. 
In addition to weatherization, this 
comprehensive package supports cru-
cial investments in renewable energy, 
including the Wind Energy Research 
and Development Act that I introduced 
with Senator SMITH. This bill would re-
authorize the Department of Energy’s 
Office of Wind Energy. It would support 
grants in order to improve the effi-
ciency, reliability, and capacity of 
wind energy generation. The Aqua 
Ventus program, which aims to be the 
first floating, deepwater, offshore wind 
project in the United States, has been 
under development by the University 
of Maine and a consortium of both pub-
lic and private partners for many years 
now. That consortium and the Univer-
sity of Maine, in particular, could ben-
efit from these targeted investments in 
offshore wind energy. 
Finally, another important compo-
nent of this comprehensive bill is en-
ergy efficiency. I am pleased that the 
Energy Savings and Industrial Com-
petitiveness Act is included in this 
package. As an original cosponsor of 
this bill, which is also known as the 
Portman-Shaheen 
energy 
efficiency 
legislation, I recognize that it can 
kick-start the use of energy efficiency 
technologies that are commercially 
available right now and can be de-
ployed by residential, commercial, and 
industrial energy users. It can also im-
prove the energy efficiency of the Fed-
eral Government, which happens to be 
our Nation’s largest consumer of en-
ergy. 
I congratulate the bill’s sponsors, 
Senators SHAHEEN and PORTMAN, for 
crafting this commonsense bill and for 
their relentless efforts in getting it 
across the finish line. 
Again, I express my appreciation to 
Chairman MURKOWSKI
and Ranking 
Member MANCHIN. 
I would also like to highlight another 
energy efficiency bill that is included 
in this package, and that is the 
Streamlining Energy Efficiency for 
Schools Act, which I sponsored with 
Senator MARK WARNER. 
In Maine, our schools have made tre-
mendous progress on energy efficiency, 
but it can be challenging for schools to 
take full advantage of programs that 
lower energy costs, in part because 
school officials may not know where to 
start. A lot of these programs are scat-
tered in different agencies across the 
Federal Government. 
Our bipartisan bill would create a co-
ordinating structure within the De-
partment of Energy that would stream-
line available Federal energy efficiency 
programs, assist school administrators 
with navigating available Federal fi-
nancing, and thus reduce school build-
ings’ energy costs. 
Again, I want to thank the com-
mittee leaders for their excellent work 
on this package of energy legislation, 
and I would urge all of my colleagues 
to join me in supporting the adoption 
of the American Energy Innovation 
Act. This is an area where we can truly 
make a difference for our constituents, 
our communities, our States, our levels 
of government, and for our country. 
Let’s get on with the adoption of this 
very worthwhile package of energy 
bills. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
STEPHEN SCHWARTZ 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the U.S. 
Senate used to be called the greatest 
deliberative body in the world. It is the 
Senate where, at this desk, Hugo Black 
wrote labor law reform. Essentially, he 
and another Senator in the U.S. Senate 
and President Roosevelt created collec-
tive bargaining. It is the desk in the 
Senate Chamber where Senator McGov-
ern from South Dakota passed legisla-
tion with Senator Dole across the aisle 
for feeding programs for hungry people 
in the United States. 
I just met with a number of people 
from the Cleveland Food Bank, the 
Middle Ohio Food Bank, and Second 
Harvest Food Bank. The McGovern- 
Dole legislation also fed hungry kids 
around the world. 
This is the body that used to do those 
kinds of things—the greatest delibera-
tive body in the world. But under Lead-
er MCCONNELL, whose office is down the 
hall, we see something different. The 
focus of this body has pretty much 
been one job, and that is confirming 
young, 38-, 40-, 42-, and 45-year-old 
judges—extreme judges—who always 
put their thumbs on the scale to sup-
port corporations over workers, to sup-
port Wall Street over consumers, and 
who put their thumbs on the scale to 
support insurance companies over pa-
tients and drug companies over pa-
tients. Even by the low standards—and, 
my gosh, they are low—we have come 
to expect from Senator MCCONNELL and 
the majority in always, always sup-
porting the rich, always fighting for 
the largest corporations, always fight-
ing for the people who have privilege 
against struggling families, against 
workers—40 percent of people in this 
country don’t have $400 to their name 
if they have an emergency to meet. In-
stead of dealing with that issue, it is 
more tax cuts for the rich. It is more 
cuts to Medicaid or to food stamps or 
to the SNAP program or any of these 
things. 
Even by the low standards we have 
come to expect from Leader MCCON-
NELL and President Trump, this nomi-
nation I am going to talk about today, 
Stephen Schwartz, is appalling. In one 
sentence, he wants to abolish Social 
Security—not scale back the cost of 
living, not throw a few people off So-
cial Security disability, not eliminate 
survivors’ benefits; he wants to abolish 
Social Security. You heard that right. 
President Trump, on the stump—he 
came to Ohio many times, my State, 
and around the country—promised he 
would protect Social Security, but now 
he puts Stephen Schwartz on the 
bench, a judge who wants to abolish it. 
Stephen Schwartz wrote that Social 
Security benefits were intended to pre-
vent ‘‘outright starvation.’’ He wasn’t 
sitting at this desk, to be sure, in the 
1930s when Social Security was started. 
Obviously, he didn’t understand that 
Social Security was one of three legs of 
the stool: Social Security, private pen-
sion—we don’t have too many of those 
anymore—and then savings that work-
ers were able to accrue. 
He says that Social Security was 
there to prevent ‘‘outright starvation,’’ 
that Social Security has ‘‘become a 
standard component of most retire-
ment programs.’’ That is kind of the 
point, to make sure that every single 
American who works her whole life and 
pays into the system can have a decent 
retirement. But for this man, Stephen 
Schwartz, the man President Trump 
and Leader MCCONNELL want to put on 
a Federal court with jurisdiction—this 
isn’t one of those lifetime judges who 
are in one district that can do a little 
bit of damage in the Northern District 
of Ohio or in the Southern District of 
Alabama—they can do plenty of dam-
age. But this is a man whom President 
Trump and Leader MCCONNELL want to 
put on a Federal court with jurisdic-
tion over the whole country. As long as 
people aren’t literally starving to 
death in retirement, that is enough, he 
seems to think. 
I would like Mr. Schwartz to come to 
Ohio. I would like him to come to Gar-
field Heights. My wife and I live in the 
city of Cleveland. Garfield Heights bor-
ders the city of Cleveland. I would like 
him to come to Garfield Heights and go 
to Carlo’s Barber Shop with me some-
day and just listen to people talk. 
Carlo cuts the hair of a whole lot of re-
tired people. I would love to hear him 
listen to the retired machinist or the 
retired teacher and say to them that 
this gentleman wants to serve in the 
Federal Government, appointed by the 
President of the United States, and 
thinks that Social Security should be 
eliminated. I want him to talk to the 
nurses and the barbers and the teach-
ers. I want him to talk to Americans 
who have paid into Social Security for 
their whole lives. 
Social Security is called social insur-
ance. It is like unemployment benefits. 
It is like Medicare. Social Security— 
you pay in every paycheck unless you 
are really rich. Then you only pay in 
for a few months. But you pay into it 
every paycheck, understanding that it 
is insurance, it is social insurance. You 
pay in, and then when you retire or if 
you get disabled—or if you die, your 
children get the survivors’ benefits. 
You pay in, paycheck after paycheck

after paycheck, and then when you 
need it—that is the whole point of in-
surance—for disability, when you need 
it for survivors’ benefits, if someone in 
the family—if the breadwinner in the 
family dies or you need it for retire-
ment, then you get it. 
It is one more broken promise to 
workers by President Trump, one more 
betrayal. 
Remember, at the beginning of the 
year, President Trump went to Davos, 
that sort of hoity-toity place in Swit-
zerland. While he was hobnobbing with 
the global elite, he let slip his plan. He 
changed his mind the next day, but it 
is clear what he wanted. After his tax 
handouts to billionaires and corpora-
tions blew up the deficit, President 
Trump said he wants to pay for those 
tax cuts—remember, 70 percent of the 
Trump tax cuts went to the richest 1 
percent. 
That is why a year and a half ago you 
saw the lobbyists going in and out of 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s office, the leader’s 
office, all saying: I want this tax cut 
for this company and this tax cut for 
that company. He wants to pay for all 
that—the President said he wants to 
pay for it by cutting Social Security 
and Medicare. Think about that. All 
these people pay into Social Security 
and pay into Medicare every day of 
their working lives—people starting at 
16 or 15 or 17—they pay that through-
out their working lives, and then the 
President says he wants to cut Medi-
care and Social Security in order to 
pay for tax cuts for rich people. 
He sold his giveaway to the wealthy 
as a tax cut for the working people. It 
wasn’t. He sold his tax cut to the 
wealthy by saying it would raise 
wages. It didn’t. People see Trump’s 
tax scam for what it really was: a give-
away to corporations and the wealthi-
est tiny sliver, the 1 percent of this 
country. 
He said over and over that it would 
mean raises for workers. He promised 
that somehow these massive corporate 
tax cuts, these giveaways to compa-
nies, would end up in workers’ pockets. 
I heard him pledge to a group of Sen-
ators at the White House in the rel-
atively small Cabinet Room—I heard 
him say that everybody is going to get 
a $4,000 raise. Well, not. They obviously 
didn’t. 
He told workers last year, the month 
after he signed the law: You are going 
to start seeing a lot more money in 
your paycheck. 
One lie after another. He did say, 
though, after signing the bill, when he 
went to Mar-a-Lago and hung around 
with his millionaire and billionaire 
friends: I made you a lot richer today 
when I signed that tax cut. He did live 
up to that promise when he made them 
richer. It just didn’t trickle down, shall 
we say, to people making $30,000, 
$50,000, and $80,000 a year. 
Instead of investing in workers, these 
corporations bought back trillions of 
dollars of their own stock to line inves-
tors’ pockets. Meanwhile, the deficit 
exploded. We know what the corporate 
crowd’s plan always is to deal with 
deficits. You come into office, you cut 
taxes on rich people. The deficit goes 
up to over $1 trillion. So what do you 
do? Oh, my gosh, the deficit is up. We 
have to cut spending. Go after Medi-
care. Go after Social Security. Go after 
Medicaid. Go after SNAP. Go after, in 
my State, the Manufacturing Exten-
sion Partnership, the MEP, which helps 
local businesses create jobs. He cut 
that to zero. He has cut programs and 
all kinds of things that matter to 
working-class, middle-class, and small- 
business Americans, all to pay for that 
tax cut. So much of what he does now 
is to pay for that tax cut that blew a 
hole in the deficit. 
It all comes back to whose side you 
are on. Do you stand with corporations, 
or do you stand with workers? Do you 
fight for Wall Street, or do you care 
about the dignity of work and live the 
dignity of work? We know for whom 
Stephen Schwartz fights. He spent his 
whole career trying to block protec-
tions for workers and students. He 
tried to stop people from voting in 
North Carolina. He has argued against 
the retirement securities that workers 
paid into their whole lives. And this is 
his reward. He has fought voting 
rights. He has worked to put Social Se-
curity out of business. He has always 
stood with the most privileged and the 
richest, and this is his reward from the 
President of the United States and his 
reward from Senator MCCONNELL, who 
sits in the front of this room. 
That is why he doesn’t belong on the 
Federal bench. If you love this country, 
you fight for the people who make it 
work. President Trump promised to 
fight for American workers, but this 
President betrayed American workers 
again and again and again. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 2657 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
as I mentioned yesterday as we were 
preparing to vote on the motion to pro-
ceed to the American Energy Innova-
tion Act, there is much to like and 
much to support in this energy reform 
legislation we have proposed. 
We are in the early stages here of leg-
islating, and I think it is probably fair 
to say that perhaps we are a little 
rusty. As we have told Members, we 
hope to have a process that allows for 
amendments from both sides, that 
gives us an opportunity to debate these 
important and timely issues. 
As we legislate and as we move 
through each step, it does require a 
level of cooperation. Again, as I men-
tioned, we haven’t been legislating on a 
weekly basis, so when it comes to just 
the process and the procedure of how 
this all comes together, maybe we are 
still in a little bit of a learning curve. 
I have had an opportunity in previous 
Congresses to be that first legislative 
vehicle that we have really taken on in 
a period of time. We have worked 
through some of them successfully be-
fore—one, 
famously 
unsuccessful. 
I 
don’t want this to fall into the ‘‘fa-
mously unsuccessful’’ category, so I am 
encouraging Members to look criti-
cally at the bill we have introduced, 
the American Energy Innovation Act, 
and work with us through this amend-
ment process. We have received a num-
ber of what I would put in the ‘‘non-
controversial bucket’’ category that I 
am hoping we will be able to accept, 
and I am hoping we can work together 
to incorporate those into our under-
lying measure. 
I wanted to take just a few minutes 
this afternoon to highlight why the in-
novation title within the American En-
ergy Innovation Act is so important 
and what this bill will do to help sup-
port and increase innovation in Amer-
ica. 
When you think about who we are as 
Americans, what we are built on, we 
are built on a foundation of ingenuity 
and innovation. We pioneered the elec-
tric grid system. We pioneered nuclear 
energy. We pioneered horizontal drill-
ing. These are many of the life-, econ-
omy-, and world-changing technologies 
that you think of in this energy space, 
and the United States has led in these 
areas. But the policies underlying Fed-
eral energy R&D have not been updated 
now in more than 12 years—a dozen 
years since we have last updated, re-
freshed, modernized. So the question is 
whether they fully reflect the range of 
opportunities and challenges that we 
have, and I would submit to you that 
they do not. We haven’t kept pace with 
everything that is happening around 
us. It is important—it is incumbent 
upon us to look to our policies. 
Modernizing our energy laws will 
support the scientific work undertaken 
by the Department of Energy, by our 
National Laboratories, and by our uni-
versities. It will also support the men 
and the women who dedicate their ca-
reers to scientific pursuits, individuals 
who truly form the backbone of Amer-
ican R&D and are a tremendous asset 
to our country. 
As I mentioned yesterday, those of us 
on the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee have spent the last year 
putting together this innovation pack-
age. Throughout that process, what we 
heard in committee from the experts 
was that three of the most promising 
technologies for clean energy are en-
ergy storage; advanced nuclear; and 
carbon capture, utilization, and stor-
age. These three areas, we are told, are 
where the promise really is if you want 
to focus on clean energy solutions. Our 
composite bill prioritizes all three 
technologies, as well as renewable en-
ergy and industrial and vehicle tech-
nologies.

CCUS—carbon capture, utilization,

coal and natural gas plants to avoid 
greenhouse gas emissions and even 
allow us to make useful products from 
carbon dioxide. I have had an oppor-
tunity and I know some other col-
leagues have had an opportunity to go

in this country but overseas—where we 
are taking that carbon, that waste 
product, and we are turning it into 
value—in other words, building mate-
rials, whether it is a sheetrock type of 
a process or whether it is the equiva-
lent of cinder blocks made out of car-
bon, that waste. When we can change 
this so we are taking a waste product 
and converting it to value—talk about 
technologies that can really change 
how we operate. 
Again, the carbon capture, utiliza-
tion, and storage technologies will 
allow us to advance in that direction. 
The bill also includes demonstration 
and deployment programs that focus 
on industrial emissions and direct air 
capture, which will similarly reduce 
emissions. 
When you think about the prospects 
and the possibilities for us with direct 
air capture, it was not too many years 
ago that it was a dream concept. Now 
it is no longer a dream concept. We are 
truly in the process of evaluating and 
piloting some of these technologies. 
I mentioned nuclear energy as one of 
the three. Nuclear energy is our Na-
tion’s largest and most reliable source 
of zero-emission electricity. Within 
this subtitle of this bill, we have in-
cluded the legislation I have been 
working on, the Nuclear Energy Lead-
ership Act, which would demonstrate 
advanced reactors to help restore our 
national leadership and keep our do-
mestic industry competitive with the 
likes of Russia and China. 
You have the CCUS and nuclear en-
ergy. The third area—the third really 
transformative area—is storage. This 
is, without a doubt, probably the most 
popular topic within our bill. We have 
included the BEST Act from Senator 
COLLINS, which creates a crosscutting 
energy storage R&D program at the 
Department of Energy. Its focus is on 
long-duration energy storage that can 
smooth out variable renewable energy 
generation. This is a very significant 
part of our bill. 
With regard to industrial energy, our 
innovation package includes language 
that Senator WHITEHOUSE authored to 
create a crosscutting R&D program to 
reduce emissions in seven areas, in-
cluding chemical production, steel and 
aluminum, high temperature process 
heat generation, and industrial carbon 
capture. 
I think you will see from that provi-
sion that, again, it is making inroads 
into those areas where we see the high-
est emissions within our industrial en-
ergy sector. As we see consumers de-
manding cleaner products, know that 
our bill helps ensure that American in-
dustries are going to be prepared to de-
liver on that. 
Another area where we are pushing 
forward, of course, is renewable energy, 
which we look at and say has the op-
portunity to provide nearly limitless 
power across America. The costs of 
many of these technologies we have al-
ready seen come down significantly. 
We take reasonable steps within this 
bill to move wind, solar, geothermal, 
marine, hydrokinetic, and other renew-
ables to full commercialization. 
To give some specifics in this space, 
in geothermal energy, we provide op-
portunities 
to 
responsibly 
develop 
more of the resource with new tech-
niques and to coproduce critical min-
erals along with it. 
In my State of Alaska, we have enor-
mous potential within the geothermal 
space. Knowing that within this title, 
we have an opportunity to really help 
move out some of the new techniques 
that are out there is significant. 
For solar energy, we are working on 
new applications like solar paint, ad-
dressing grid integration challenges, 
and improving recycling. For marine 
energy—marine hydrokinetic—we are 
developing offshore testing centers to 
scale up new concepts. 
I remind colleagues, I come from a 
State where we have more coastline 
than the entire United States put to-
gether of all the coastal States there. 
This is an area that I have long looked 
to and said: Why are we not doing more 
when it comes to tapping into our ma-
rine energy sources? 
Our wind energy provisions include 
offshore and floating wind development 
and demonstration activities. We are 
working to push out in the renewable 
sector some of these areas where we 
are still pioneering in many of these 
ways. We have demonstrated wind on 
land with great efficiency. How are we 
doing with offshore? What more can we 
be doing there? 
By providing the Department of En-
ergy with new tools and direction, we 
are helping to ensure the United States 
remains the world leader in innovative 
technologies. 
One of the challenges we hear about 
as we discuss these cool things in the 
Energy Committee is how you get 
these great cutting-edge ideas from the 
lab to the market. To address that, our 
bill reauthorizes the Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency-Energy. This is 
ARPA-E. This is the entity that helps 
these nascent technologies bridge the 
so-called valley of death and reach 
commercialization. ARPA-E has al-
ready delivered significant results with 
nearly $3 billion in follow-on private fi-
nancing for its projects. 
We had the Secretary for the Depart-
ment of Energy, Secretary Brouillette, 
before the committee just today on a 
budget hearing. He heard repeatedly 
from members on both sides of the 
aisle the value that comes from ARPA- 
E. Of course, developing new and clean-
er and more affordable technologies 
doesn’t benefit us just here at home; it 
can also make a meaningful impact 
around the world. 
We shouldn’t just develop and deploy 
new technologies at home. We should 
also sell them to other countries 
around the world. This is an incredible 
opportunity for economic growth. We 
know that we will simultaneously 
lower global greenhouse gas emissions 
and help to cement geopolitical rela-
tionships that can span generations. 
We will be discussing more of the 
component pieces within the American 
Energy Innovation Act. You are going 
to continue to hear me say that this is 
good legislation, this is important leg-
islation, this is timely legislation— 
after 12 years. But you don’t nec-
essarily have to take my word for it. 
Consider the work of the American En-
ergy Innovation Council, which is led 
by noted individuals, luminaries, like 
Norm Augustine and Bill Gates. They 
have found that at least 50 percent of 
the U.S. annual GDP growth can be 
traced to increases in innovation and 
that innovation has been the predomi-
nant driver of U.S. economic growth 
over the last century. 
When we say that this Energy bill fo-
cuses on that innovation, recognize the 
value that innovation brings to us in 
the energy sector. The council’s mem-
bers have also observed that advances 
in energy technology deserve par-
ticular 
attention 
since 
energy 
underlies virtually every facet of mod-
ern life. Without a sufficient, reliable, 
and affordable source of energy, the 
U.S. economy would grind to a halt. 
They are exactly right in their 
words. Yet the United States continues 
to allocate less than 0.1 percent of its 
annual Federal outlays to energy R&D. 
Put that into context. This is an after-
thought in our budget and, unfortu-
nately, in real life for too many Ameri-
cans. We take for granted that when 
you pull up to the gas station, they are 
going to have fuel there. We take for 
granted that when you flip the light 
switch, the lights are going to come on. 
The reality is, it takes a tremendous 
amount of work to make that happen. 
It is innovation that brings this all to 
us. 
Innovation is worth it. The proof is 
literally around us with everything we 
do. Given our history, given our people, 
given our institutions, I know this 
country can continue to lead the way 
on new technologies. What we need to 
do is make sure we have policies that 
help further incent them, that do not 
drag down that opportunity to meet 
those challenges. 
I am confident that we have a good 
bill in front of us, a strong bill in front 
of us. I appreciate the support that the 
Senate has shown for our bill thus far. 
I look forward to working on amend-
ments as the week continues. I urge 
colleagues to provide us with those 
matters that you have been working 
on. We want to try to accommodate, 
but we also recognize that we haven’t 
been in this process before where we 
have had the opportunity for open 
amendments. We want to try do it 
right. We want to try to be efficient, as

we do in the Energy Committee, and 
we want to be fair to our colleagues. 
With that, I look forward to the 
input and the cooperation from fellow 
Senators as we proceed with the discus-
sion about the American Energy Inno-
vation Act. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am here today for the 267th 
time to call this Chamber to wake up 
to the threat of climate change. My 
chart here is getting a little dog-eared 
with use. 
Let me dive right in with a report 
from over 30 years ago that was pre-
sented to a major conference here in 
Washington, DC. On the very first page 
of this report it says: 
Increases in atmospheric concentration of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) and other key gases . . . 
that are opaque to portions of the infrared 
spectrum result in the ‘‘greenhouse effect’’ 
or global warming. When short wavelength 
infrared radiation from the sun warms the 
earth’s surface, and this heat is later radi-
ated from the earth, some gases in the at-
mosphere are not transparent to the longer 
wavelength re-radiation, the heat does not 
escape, and the atmosphere becomes warmer, 
much as does the interior of a greenhouse. 
That is a flawless description of cli-
mate change. I wonder who wrote it. 
Well, let me continue. 
After some hedging about the state 
of the science and the uncertainty sur-
rounding how much climate change 
could be attributed to humans at that 
point in time, this same report delves 
into the expected effects of climate 
change on our planet. It reads: 
There is qualitative agreement among 
prognosticators that sea levels will rise, wet-
lands will flood, salt water will infuse fresh 
water supplies, and there will be changes in 
the distribution of tree and crop species and 
agricultural productivity. 
Wow. That is really accurate. That is 
all the stuff we are actually seeing hap-
pen right now. Gosh, I wonder who 
wrote that. Let’s continue on through 
the report. 
A significant rise in sea levels will flood 
now habitable land in some countries. . . . 
Developed countries may be able to protect 
their cities, at least for some years, by build-
ing levees and dikes at a considerable cost to 
avoid major displacements of people and 
their economic bases. 
We are also seeing that. Impressive— 
whoever wrote this report really got 
this quite accurately 30 years ago. 
Let me go on with the report: 
These same actions will affect wetlands 
and it may not be possible to protect both 
coastal and wetland areas. 
Once you have built your dike, it 
pushes water out into wetland areas. 
The report says: 
Flooding will intrude into water supplies, 
such as coastal cities (e.g. Miami and New 
Orleans) . . . . 
Wow. Who wrote this? This is good. 
It continues: 
Changes in temperature patterns will af-
fect natural ecosystems by altering the dis-
tributions of species, and affecting forestry 
and silviculture. Under various scenarios, 
commonly harvested species will move north 
and try to grow in different soil types. 
Ranges of particular species are likely to 
change because trees in the southern part of 
the present range may die off much more 
quickly than they can propagate further 
north . . . . 
This is all stuff we are seeing now— 
all predicted 30 years ago in this re-
port. Wow. I wonder who wrote it. 
I will continue quoting the report: 
Similarly, crop lands will change. In 
present farm areas, there will be greater reli-
ance on irrigation. The stress will depend on 
changes in precipitation patterns, which is 
now difficult (at best) to predict. Grain pro-
duction will move north and productivity 
may fall because of differing soil types. Glob-
al warming could expand the northern range 
of livestock disease and pests . . . . 
Still quoting from this report: 
Global warming will affect snowfall pat-
terns, hence melt, and affect water supplies. 
Most of California’s water supplies are from 
snow melt and if snow is reduced to rain, or 
melts quickly during the winter, water sup-
plies in the summer will be less than now. 
Wow. Thirty years ago they predicted 
all of that. That is really impressive. 
Fast forward to today, and that is ex-
actly what we are seeing. All of it is 
underway already. Sea level rise is al-
ready happening. The tide gauge in 
Naval Station Newport, in my home 
State of Rhode Island, shows over 10 
inches of sea level rise over the last 
century. Temperatures are up globally, 
with some areas measuring increases 
well above 2 degrees Celsius. Wildlife 
and plants are indeed shifting away 
from the equator, like the maple trees 
whose range is creeping out of the 
United States toward Canada. And, of 
course, we have seen water tables con-
tinue to drop as temperatures rise and 
snowpack dwindles. 
Wow. This report was so accurate. 
Who wrote it? 
Well, let’s look for a minute at the 
prescriptions that the report lays out. 
What should we do about this problem 
it describes so accurately? Those pre-
scriptions are pretty good for 30 years 
ago, too. Here is what its authors reck-
on typical, sensible governments would 
do in response to climate change: 
(1) Reduce the emissions of CO2 by reduc-
ing the use or mix of fossil fuels; (2) Reduce 
the emissions of potential pollutants; (3) Im-
prove energy efficiency; (4) Ban or restrict 
the manufacture of certain chemicals; and 
(5) Seek to affect the natural emissions of 
key chemical compounds. 
Wow. Indeed, governments around 
the world have adopted these policies. 
There are dozens of carbon pricing re-
gimes in place, including in some of 
our biggest global competitors, like 
the program China is rolling out this 
year. There are comprehensive energy 
efficiency programs and bans on cli-
mate-damaging chemicals like HFCs 
and global efforts to harness natural 
processes like growing trees to seques-
ter carbon. 
That is really good prescription, who-
ever wrote it. This rigorous analysis 
was so good that its authors eagerly 
thrust it into the hands of political 
leaders here in the United States. Not 
only did the authors present it to the 
Symposium on Industrial Development 
and Climate Change in May 1989, but 
they submitted it to the U.S. House of 
Representatives at a hearing on the 
same day. In the hearing, the authors 
condemned the House committee on 
climate-related 
legislation 
and 
ex-
pressed support for ‘‘coordinat[ing] fed-
eral research and national global cli-
mate change policy efforts.’’ 
So who was it? Who was this sensible, 
forward-thinking group that lauded a 
smart bill 30 years ago that was de-
signed 
to 
prepare 
us 
for 
climate 
change? Who was it over 30 years ago 
who presented all of these sound find-
ings and recommendations to inter-
national business leaders and to Mem-
bers of Congress? Who was it? Hold 
your breath. It was the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce—the biggest, most power-
ful trade group in Washington and one 
of the biggest obstructors of climate 
action in Washington today, according 
to the nonpartisan watchdog Influence 
Map. 
Here is a chart showing the big cor-
porate players in Washington on cli-
mate. The good guys are over here on 
the green side, and the bad guys are 
over here on the red side. The worst is 
that climate miscreant, Marathon Pe-
troleum, that is busy messing around 
with electronic vehicle taxes and mess-
ing around with vehicle fuel efficiency 
standards. Yet, right here, lined up 
with Phillips 66, the Southern Com-
pany, and Marathon Petroleum, is— 
boom—the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
It is way over on the far side of climate 
obstruction and denial. 
As Influence Map’s Dylan Tanner tes-
tified last fall, ‘‘The U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce . . . is likely the most au-
thoritative voice of American busi-
ness,’’ and it has been one of the most 
ardent opponents of climate action. 
It is just gross. The chamber knew 
about this problem early on. It took its 
own sound climate report to business 
leaders and to the U.S. Congress in the 
1980s. It described then what we are 
seeing now. It described then what it 
has denied since then. It made rec-
ommendations that we are still push-
ing for now. It was poised back then, in 
the 1980s, to be a part of the solution to 
climate change—to get onto this prob-
lem early before it metastasized into 
the climate crisis we experience today. 
Instead, here is what the chamber 
did: It opposed one comprehensive cli-
mate bill after another in Congress. It 
opposed them all—the bipartisan cap 
and trade bill in 2005, the Energy Pol-
icy Act. The chamber sent out a Key 
Vote Alert signal that whoever voted

in favor of the bill could face an on-
slaught of political attacks in the next 
election. That is another feature of the 
chamber’s climate obstruction. 
It runs TV ads against candidates 
who might do something about the cli-
mate. Here are some hot moments from 
some of its climate attack ads: If we 
were to do anything about climate 
change, obviously, you would be freez-
ing in your bed, wearing your coat 
while in a sleeping bag with your cov-
ers. Clearly, you would have to cook 
your breakfast over candles, in a tin 
can, and you would have to walk to 
work. 
That is its crooked, political elec-
tioneering image of what doing some-
thing about climate change would 
mean for Americans. There is its logo, 
proudly, on that whole pack of lies. 
In 2007, the chamber ran political TV 
ads against climate legislation, mak-
ing all of those threats: People would 
be prevented from heating their homes. 
People wouldn’t be able to drive to 
work. People would cook over candles. 
Then, in 2009, the chamber led the 
charge against the Waxman-Markey 
bill. The chamber tanked Waxman- 
Markey, and since then, the Repub-
licans in Congress have refused to hold 
hearings on, to mark up, to debate, or 
to vote on any legislation that pro-
poses a policy framework for economy- 
wide reductions in carbon pollution. 
We have a lost decade, in significant 
respects, thanks to the misbehavior of 
the chamber of commerce—the largest, 
most powerful lobbying force in our 
country. 
The chamber doesn’t just try to beat 
climate action in Congress; the cham-
ber also has fought climate action in 
the courts, and it has fought climate 
action in the agencies of the executive 
branch. Here are some lowlights of 
chamber mischief: 
In 2010, the chamber sued the EPA 
and sought to overturn the finding that 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions endanger 
public health and welfare. Disabling 
the endangerment finding would crip-
ple the EPA’s ability to regulate car-
bon under the Clean Air Act. When the 
courts rejected the chamber’s lawsuit, 
the chamber became central command 
for corporate lawyers, coal lobbyists, 
and Republican political strategists 
who devised the legal schemes to fight 
climate regulations. This produced an-
other chamber lawsuit to block the 
Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon pol-
lution from powerplants. 
Of course, once President Trump 
took office, the chamber switched from 
defense and obstruction to offense and 
began attacking Obama administration 
rules that limited carbon pollution. 
The chamber even funded the phony re-
port that President Trump used as his 
justification for leaving the Paris ac-
cord. That is the contribution to this 
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It 
authored 30 years ago the report that I 
read from. It made the recommenda-
tions 30 years ago about fixing this 
problem. Then it turned into this cli-
mate obstruction, political monster. 
Worst of all, the chamber has been 
fighting science itself. It actually pro-
posed putting the evidence of climate 
change on trial in what its own offi-
cials branded as the ‘‘Scopes monkey 
trial of the 21st century.’’ The chamber 
said the trial ‘‘would be evolution 
versus creationism.’’ Of course, the 
chamber has been the 800-pound gorilla 
in elections that every Member of Con-
gress and candidate for Congress knows 
all too well. 
The 2010 Citizens United decision al-
lowed what we call outside groups, 
anonymous groups, to spend unlimited 
sums on electioneering activities. In 
the wake of that decision, the chamber 
has funneled, roughly, $150 million into 
congressional races—$150 million. This 
makes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
the largest spender of undisclosed do-
nations on congressional races—the 
largest spender of what we call dark 
money on congressional races. 
If you dare cross the chamber or 
don’t subscribe to its climate denial- 
climate obstruction point of view, you 
risk its running an ad against you like 
this ad, which was run against a U.S. 
Senate candidate in Pennsylvania in 
2016. This is toward the end of the ad, 
and the theory of the ad is that the 
candidate is so determined to tax en-
ergy that she is going to tax the energy 
of these women’s children who are run-
ning around on a playground. 
Here are two moms on a playground 
who are watching their children run 
around, and the setup is: Oh, wow. How 
energetic Johnny and Billy are. Oh, but 
don’t you know? The Senate campaign 
is going to tax their energy. 
‘‘Run, Jimmy. Run’’ is the punch 
line. 
Classy. 
So what gives? How did the chamber 
go from being the sensible climate re-
alist to the hardened climate obstruc-
tor? 
The answer is pretty simple—fossil 
fuel money. 
As Influence Map’s Dylan Tanner 
told us at our hearing, big trade groups 
like the chamber tend to adopt the 
lowest common denominator positions 
on climate of their most oppositional 
members. For the chamber, that lowest 
common denominator is Big Oil and 
other fossil fuel giants. 
Fossil fuel uses the chamber as its 
tool to defend—at all costs—what the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
esti-
mates as being a $650 billion subsidy in 
the United States. That was the num-
ber estimated by the IMF for 2015—a 
$650 billion subsidy to fossil fuel for 
getting away with what economists 
call 
negative 
externalities—shoving 
their costs on other people. If you be-
lieve in market economics, those nega-
tive externalities should be baked into 
the cost of the product, but they don’t 
want that. They want the public to 
bear the cost so they can sell their 
products cheaper. That is a subsidy, 
and it is a $650 billion subsidy every 
year. So giving the chamber, let’s say, 
$150 million to spend is chump change 
against $650 billion. That is exactly 
what the chamber does. It lets itself be 
used by fossil fuel interests to deliver 
this message. 
What about the rest of the chamber’s 
members? Not everybody in the cham-
ber is a fossil fuel company. 
Big tech, what about you guys? You 
have companies in your ranks who 
claim to care a lot about the climate. 
Google, for instance, has the com-
pany motto: ‘‘Don’t Be Evil.’’ Google 
warns 
its 
investors 
that 
climate 
change threatens its operations, that 
its ‘‘systems are vulnerable to damage 
or interruption from natural disasters 
[and] the effects of climate change 
(such as sea-level rise, drought, flood-
ing, wildfires, and increased storm se-
verity).’’ 
Google 
also 
tells 
investors 
that 
‘‘[c]limate change is one of the most 
significant global challenges of our 
time’’ and that it has a goal to reach 
100-percent renewable energy for its op-
erations. Google even signed the Cor-
porate Renewable Energy Buyers’ Prin-
ciples and the American Business Act 
on Climate Pledge. Yet Google also 
funds the chamber’s anti-climate cru-
sade. 
I don’t know about my colleagues, 
but Google does not come to my office 
and say: Hey, you need to do something 
good on climate. Google has a million 
issues it lobbies us on, but they are not 
on climate change. On climate change, 
it supports the chamber of commerce, 
and the chamber of commerce is our 
adversary. 
Look at the big food and beverage 
companies. They have crops—a supply 
chain of grain and fruit and vegetables. 
They have crops that the chamber’s re-
port of 30 years ago told us would be af-
fected by climate change. Those crops 
are the bread and butter—the supply 
chain—of these big food and beverage 
companies. Where are they? 
Many food and beverage companies 
say they understand the threat of cli-
mate change. Pepsi signed the Ceres 
BICEP Climate Declaration and the 
Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders 
Group Trillion Tonne Communique. 
Those were both important commit-
ments to climate action. There is 
Pepsi’s rival, Coca-Cola. Coke says it 
plans to reduce CO2 emissions by 25 
percent and that to do so will work to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions across 
its value chain and make comprehen-
sive carbon footprint reductions across 
its manufacturing processes, packaging 
formats, delivery fleet, refrigeration 
equipment, and ingredient sourcing. 
Yet both Coke and Pepsi fund the 
chamber of commerce’s denial and ob-
struction operation, and they fund the 
American Beverage Association—their 
little 
beverage 
trade 
association— 
which, in turn, runs more money to the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
What is the net result here in Con-
gress of all of that? 
You have two companies that ac-
tively reduce their carbon emissions 
and enthusiastically, publicly, support

March 3, 2020 
good climate policy, but in Congress, 
through their funding of the chamber, 
they take the position of opposing cli-
mate action here in Washington—the 
place where it really, really counts. 
Decades ago, one of most powerful 
political forces in Washington, the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, knew climate 
change was coming. It wrote that re-
port. It described how global warming 
happened. It described what the con-
sequences were going to be in the 
oceans, in the agricultural sector, 
across our country. It made regula-
tions as to how to head it off. It under-
stood the risks. It knew. It knew what 
we needed to do to head off the worst 
consequences and, even back then, sup-
ported legislation to help us prepare. 
Then, in came the fossil fuel indus-
try. The chamber will not tell us how 
they are funded. I could tell you right 
now how this all worked except that 
the chamber will not disclose how it is 
funded. But it sure looks as though 
floods of fossil fuel money came in and 
bought the chamber, caused it to 
change its position on the facts of cli-
mate change, caused it to change its 
position on the consequences of cli-
mate change, caused it to change its 
position on what we needed to do to 
head off climate change. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce let 
itself be bought by the fossil fuel indus-
try. And thanks to the greed of that 
one-member industry, the fossil fuel 
folks, and thanks to the indifference of 
the others—thanks to the indifference 
of the tech sector, the indifference of 
the ag sector—we still have yet to act, 
30 years later. 
At the close of the chamber’s report 
is a really telling quote from the satir-
ical comic strip ‘‘Pogo.’’ ‘‘Pogo,’’ in a 
legendary cartoon from when I was 
about as young as the pages here, says: 
We have met the enemy, and it is us. 
The chamber quotes that at the end 
of its report: ‘‘We have met the enemy, 
and it is us.’’ 
Well, that was an observation about 
what was going wrong with the planet 
and how it was our emissions that were 
causing it. We have met the enemy; we 
see this danger; we understand it; and 
we are the cause of it. It is us. 
But at the same time, it is also like 
a preconfession by the chamber: ‘‘We 
have met the enemy, and it is us.’’ For 
30 years, the chamber has been the 
enemy. Since Citizens United, it has 
been an implacable enemy. They have 
been wrong on climate. They knew it 30 
years ago; they know it now. 
We need to fix this, and we need cor-
porate America to extract itself from 
the thrall of the evildoers in its midst, 
and we need to solve, at last, this prob-
lem. 
So time to wake up. 
I yield the floor.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Israel—KC–46A Aerial Refueling Aircraft 
The Government of Israel has requested to 
buy up to eight (8) KC–46 aircraft; up to sev-
enteen (17) PW4062 turbofan engines (16 in-
stalled, 1 spare); and up to eighteen (18) 
MAGR 2K–GPS SAASM receivers (16 in-
stalled, 2 spares). Also included are AN/ARC– 
210 U/VHF radios, APX–119 Identification 
Friend or Foe transponders, initial spares 
and 
repair 
parts, 
consumables, 
support 
equipment, 
technical 
data, 
engineering 
change proposals, publications, Field Service 
Representatives (FSRs), repair and return, 
depot maintenance, training and training 
equipment, contractor technical and logis-
tics personnel services, U.S. Government and 
contractor representative support, Group A 
and B installation for subsystems, flight test 
and certification, other related elements of 
logistics support and training. The total es-
timated program cost is $2.4 billion. 
The United States is committed to the se-
curity of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. na-
tional interests to assist Israel to develop 
and maintain a strong and ready self-defense 
capability. This proposed sale is consistent 
with those objectives. 
The proposed sale further supports the for-
eign policy and national security of the 
United States by allowing Israel to provide a 
redundant capability to U.S. assets within 
the region, potentially freeing U.S. assets for 
use elsewhere during times of war. Aerial re-
fueling and strategic airlift are consistently 
cited as significant shortfalls for our allies. 
In addition, the sale improves Israel’s na-
tional security posture as a key U.S. ally. 
Israel will have no difficulty absorbing this 
equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed equipment and support will 
not alter the basic military balance in the 
region. 
The principal contractors will be Boeing 
Corporation, Everett, WA, for the aircraft; 
and Raytheon Company, Waltham, MA, for 
the MAGR 2K. There are no known offset 
agreements proposed in connection with this 
potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of two U.S. field serv-
ice/contractor representatives to Israel. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM 
WALLACE COVINGTON 
Ms. SINEMA. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the esteemed ca-
reer and public service of Dr. William 
Wallace Covington, who is retiring as 
regents’ professor of forestry at North-
ern Arizona University, NAU. 
As founder and director of NAU’s Ec-
ological Restoration Institute, Dr. Cov-
ington’s 
research 
has 
substantially 
contributed to our understanding of 
the conditions necessary to maintain 
healthy forest ecosystems. His dem-
onstrations that selective thinning and 
controlled fires may mitigate more in-
tense, destructive fires have undoubt-
edly helped save significant swathes of 
southwestern ponderosa pine forests, 
including those found in Arizona. 
Dr. Covington was recognized as an 
Outstanding Teaching Scholar by NAU, 
and received the Biswell Lifetime 
Achievement Award from the Associa-
tion for Fire Ecology, has testified be-
fore both congressional and State nat-
ural resource committees and advised a 
former Chief of the U.S. Forest Service 
and former Secretary of the Interior. 
Dr. Covington’s dedication to novel re-
search and evidence-driven outcomes 
has been essential in safeguarding our 
communities from uncontrolled fires. 
I thank Dr. Covington for his years of 
dedicated work and public service on 
behalf of Arizona, the Southwest, and 
the American people. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD a letter from 
Bruce Babbitt recognizing Dr. Cov-
ington. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JANUARY 26, 2019. 
Hon. KYRSTEN SINEMA, 
U.S. Senator, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MARTHA MCSALLY, 
U.S. Senator, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SENATOR
SINEMA
AND
SENATOR 
MCSALLY: I write to support Congressional 
recognition of the remarkable career and 
public service of Professor Wallace Cov-
ington who is retiring as Regents Professor 
of Forestry at Northern Arizona University. 
Professor Covington’s work came to my at-
tention back in 1993. At the Interior Depart-
ment we were confronted with a rapid in-
crease in large, destructive fires in the west-
ern ponderosa forest in the Southwest. In re-
sponse to a proposal from Covington, the De-
partment dedicated an extensive forest tract 
at Mt. Trumbull north of the Grand Canyon 
for large scale experimentation, and we 
began to fund his work. 
What emerged from the Mt. Trumbull ex-
periment was a new understanding of pre- 
settlement open forests that were main-
tained free of dense thickets and underbrush 
by frequent, low intensity natural fires. Fol-
lowing European settlement, these natural 
forests became overly dense as a result of 
fire suppression and over grazing. With so 
much unnatural fuel accumulation, forest 
fires have become more intense, widespread 
and destructive. 
Covington’s work at Mount Trumbull dem-
onstrated that these forests could be brought 
back to a more natural condition by a care-
fully controlled process of selective thinning 
and the application of low intensity pre-
scribed fire. 
Covington has since taken his academic 
work to the policy level by organizing sup-
port for large scale restoration programs. 
The Congress, with leadership from Senator 
Kyl, has supported creation of the Ecological 
Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona 
University and comparable centers at Colo-
rado State University and New Mexico High-
lands University. 
This work continues today with support 
from local governments and environmental 
groups. An example is the 4FRI project, a 
twenty year restoration project across sev-
eral million acres in northern Arizona, man-
aged by the Forest Service with support 
from the Congress and a broad coalition of 
state and federal agencies, local commu-
nities and environmental organizations. 
Covington’s work is an outstanding exam-
ple of science in action under leadership 
from a dedicated public servant, forging con-
sensus policy changes that are now restoring 
forests, and safeguarding communities from 
uncontrolled wildfire. 
His work and advocacy has been of ines-
timable benefit to the American people. 
Sincerely, 
BRUCE BABBITT.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING PRESTIGE 
AMERITECH 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as 
chairman of the Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit, which drives our econ-
omy. This week, it is my pleasure to 
honor Prestige Ameritech of North 
Richland Hills, TX, as the Senate 
Small Business of the Week. 
When 
Kimberly-Clark 
Corporation 
closed its medical protective gear man-
ufacturing facilities in the United 
States, Dan Reese and Mike Bowen 
sought to revitalize this critical indus-
try. Since 2006, Dan and Mike have led 
Prestige Ameritech, which specializes 
in manufacturing high-quality medical 
protective gear. During the HlNl swine 
flu 
epidemic 
in 
2009, 
Prestige 
Ameritech worked around the clock to 
produce critical protective equipment, 
including N95 respirators, medical face 
shields, and medical goggles. As the 
epidemic subsided, Prestige Ameritech 
struggled as its clients returned to for-
eign products instead of continuing to 
support this vital industry. Dozens of 
workers were laid off as the company 
fought to survive. 
Now, 
14 
years 
later, 
Prestige 
Ameritech is the largest domestic sur-
gical mask manufacturer, employing 
about 100 workers. They are certified 
as 
an 
FDA 
Registered 
Facility, 
HUBZone, and a certified Native Amer-
ican Owned Business. As a leading ad-
vocate of medical supply chain secu-
rity, Prestige Ameritech supports de-
velopment of the medical industrial 
sector in the United States. According 
to the Department of Health and 
Human Services, more than 90 percent 
of surgical masks sold in the United 
States are manufactured overseas. If a 
public health emergency arose, Dan 
and Mike have warned, disruptions in 
mask supply could endanger millions 
of Americans. 
For over a decade, since the HlNl 
swine flu epidemic, Prestige Ameritech 
has strengthened industry partnerships 
and warned government officials of the 
dangers of exporting our medical indus-
trial capacity. As part of the Secure 
Mask 
Supply 
Association—SMSA— 
Prestige Ameritech works with domes-
tically owned and operated surgical 
and respirator mask manufacturers to 
raise awareness regarding the impor-
tance of prevention and readiness by 
creating and maintaining an infra-
structure for an American-made mask 
supply. For years, Prestige Ameritech 
and SMSA sounded the alarm about 
the vulnerability of American medical 
supply chains. 
In 
response 
to 
the 
growing 
coronavirus 
outbreak, 
Prestige 
Ameritech has ramped up their daily 
production to 600,000 masks. Their 
work provides protection for millions 
worldwide, from healthcare workers to 
American citizens abroad. Due to in-
creased demand, they have prioritized 
supplying hospitals and medical instal-
lations with personal protective equip-
ment. The disruption of American med-
ical supply chains has catapulted Pres-
tige Ameritech into the spotlight, 
highlighting the vital importance of 
their work. They have been profiled in 
national news outlets including the 
New York Times, Washington Post, 
Wired, and CNN. Through this surge in 
interest, Prestige Ameritech has re-
mained committed to their mission, 
driving home the need for a resurgence 
of domestic industrial medial sup-
pliers. 
Recognizing their foresight, knowl-
edge, and courage, I am proud to con-
gratulate Dan, Mike, and the entire 
Prestige Ameritech team for being 
named as the Senate Small Business of 
the Week. I look forward to watching 
your continued growth, advocacy, and 
leadership in this critical segment of 
our industrial sector.∑

REMEMBERING WILLIAM 
FULGINITI 
∑
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to a great 
New Mexican, William Fulginiti, who 
for 43 years led the New Mexico Munic-
ipal League. Sadly, Bill passed away 
February 25, 2020, at the age of 78, sur-
rounded by family and those he loved.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1295 
March 3, 2020 
Bill held the position of executive di-
rector of the State municipal league 
for over four decades because, for all 
those years, he led the organization 
with skill, energy, commitment, and 
vision. The New Mexico Municipal 
League is 106 incorporated municipali-
ties and 14 other organizations strong 
because of Bill’s work over the years 
growing the organization. The league 
functions as one of the most effective 
voices for New Mexico communities in 
our State. Over two-thirds of New 
Mexico’s population resides in incor-
porated municipalities. While Bill’s re-
sponsibility for promoting those com-
munities was great, he gladly took on 
the challenge and achieved enormous 
success over the years. 
Bill was a staple in New Mexico poli-
tics, a staple at the State legislature. 
His work was, in large part, responsible 
for giving the municipal league the 
strong voice it now has. Bill knew the 
facts. He knew the programs. He knew 
the laws. He knew the people. He un-
derstood the complexities of how cities 
work and brought his deft negotiating 
skills to the table to further the inter-
ests of communities around the State. 
He was, according to Roundhouse vet-
erans, ‘‘a force to be reckoned with.’’ 
Bill helped launch the New Mexico 
Self Insurers Fund and the National 
League of Cities Mutual Insurance 
Fund, and he initiated the first bond 
pool for New Mexico cities so they 
could access national bond markets 
and save money on interest rates. 
Bill’s reach was wide. At various 
times, he served on the board of direc-
tors of the National League of Cities. 
He testified before Congress on the in-
frastructure needs of cities. At the 
time of his passing, he served as vice 
chair of the New Mexico Finance Au-
thority, a legislatively created agency 
that helps finance important infra-
structure projects for cities, counties, 
and State agencies. And he was serving 
as a member on the State water trust 
board, 
a 
board 
that 
funds 
water 
projects critical to our arid State. 
Over the years, Bill’s work earned 
him the Governor’s Distinguished Pub-
lic Service Award and the New Mexico 
Distinguished Public Administration 
Award, among other awards. 
Bill’s many decades of public service 
also included serving our Nation for 8 
years in the U.S. Air Force. Bill earned 
his master’s degree in public adminis-
tration from Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity. 
Bill served our State with integrity, 
honesty, and a sense of humor, and he 
helped mentor the next generation of 
public servants. 
Bill’s influence in our State was far 
and wide. His work will continue to 
have a positive impact in the years to 
come. We will miss you, Bill, but we 
will not forget you.∑

SHOULD REBID THE 2022 WINTER 
OLYMPIC GAMES TO BE HOSTED 
BY A COUNTRY THAT RECOG-

AND 
RESPECTS 
HUMAN 
RIGHTS 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, 
Mr. MARKEY, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. DURBIN, 
Mr. COTTON, Mr. YOUNG, Mrs. BLACK-
BURN, Mr. INHOFE, Mr. RUBIO, Ms. 
MCSALLY, Mrs. LOEFFLER, and Mr. 
JONES) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 526 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee has announced Beijing, People’s Re-
public of China, as the host city of the 2022 
Winter Olympic Games; 
Whereas the Olympic charter states that 
the goal of Olympism is to promote ‘‘a peace-
ful society concerned with the preservation 
of human dignity’’; 
Whereas the 2019 Trafficking in Persons 
Report of the Department of State relating 
to the People’s Republic of China indicates 
that— 
(1) authorities in the People’s Republic of 
China have arbitrarily detained more than 
1,000,000 ethnic Muslims, including Uyghur, 
ethnic Kazakh, and Kyrgyz individuals, in as 
many as 1,200 ‘‘vocational training centers’’, 
which are internment camps designed to 
erase ethnic and religious identities; 
(2) the national household registry system 
of the People’s Republic of China restricts 
the freedom of rural inhabitants to legally 
change their workplace or residence, placing 
the internal migrant population of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China at high risk of forced 
labor in brick kilns, coal mines, and fac-
tories; 
(3) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China subjects Christians and members 
of other religious groups to forced labor in 
brick kilns, food processing centers, and fac-
tories as part of detention for the purpose of 
ideological indoctrination; and 
(4) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China provides financial incentives for 
companies to open factories near the intern-
ment camps, and local governments receive 
additional funds from the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China for each inmate 
forced to work in an internment camp; 
Whereas, in October 2019, Radio Free Asia 
reported that— 
(1) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China, as part of its Pair Up and Be-
come Family program, assigns male Han 
Chinese ‘‘relatives’’ to monitor the homes of 
Uyghur families in the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region (XUAR) and to regularly 
sleep in the same beds as the wives of men 
detained in the internment camps of the re-
gion; and 
(2) Uyghur individuals who protest hosting 
‘‘relatives’’ or refuse to take part in study 
sessions or other activities with the officials 
in their homes are subject to additional re-
strictions and may face detention in the in-
ternment camps; 
Whereas, in July 2019, Australia, Austria, 
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Fin-
land, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, 
Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, 
Sweden, Switzerland, and the United King-
dom jointly condemned the arbitrary deten-
tion and surveillance of Uyghur individuals 
and other minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region; 
Whereas, in June 2019, the Independent Tri-
bunal Into Forced Organ Harvesting from 
Prisoners of Conscience in China of the 
China Tribunal found that— 
(1) forced organ harvesting has been car-
ried out for years throughout the People’s 
Republic of China on a significant scale, and 
practitioners of Falun Gong have been the 
main source of organs; and 
(2) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China has committed crimes against 
humanity with respect to Uyghur individuals 
and practitioners of Falun Gong; 
Whereas the report of Freedom House enti-
tled ‘‘Freedom in the World 2019’’ indicates 
that— 
(1) women, ethnic and religious minorities, 
and the LGBT community in the People’s 
Republic of China have no opportunity to 
gain meaningful political representation and 
are barred from advancing their interests 
outside the formal structures of the Com-
munist Party of China; 
(2) foreign journalists in the People’s Re-
public of China were surveilled, harassed, 
physically abused, detained to prevent meet-
ings with certain individuals, and had their 
visas withheld; 
(3) hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners 
have recently received long prison terms, 
and many other individuals were arbitrarily 
detained in various ‘‘legal education’’ facili-
ties, where they were tortured, sometimes 
fatally, until they abandoned their beliefs; 
(4) limitations on due process in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China, including the exces-
sive use of pretrial detention, are rampant, 
and an extended crackdown on human rights 
lawyers has weakened the access of defend-
ants to independent legal counsel; and 
(5) individuals attempting to petition the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China with respect to grievances or injus-
tices are routinely intercepted in their ef-
forts to travel to Beijing, forcefully returned 
to their hometowns, or subjected to extra-
legal detention in ‘‘black jails’’, psychiatric 
institutions, and other sites at which they 
are at risk of abuse; 
Whereas the annual report of the U.S. Con-
gressional-Executive Commission on China 
for 2019 indicates that— 
(1) the one-party authoritarian political 
system of the People’s Republic of China de-
prives the people of the People’s Republic of 
China of their right to meaningfully partici-
pate in electoral processes and public life 
generally; 
(2) in 2019, the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China detained and prosecuted 
individuals who criticized government offi-
cials and policies online and censored or dis-
torted a range of news and information that 
the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China considered ‘‘politically sensitive’’, in-
cluding— 
(A) 
the 
30th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Tiananmen Square massacre; 
(B) human rights abuses in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region; and 
(C) the protests in Hong Kong against 
proposed extradition legislation; 
(3) Hong Kong authorities, under the influ-
ence of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China, violated fundamental free-
doms of the people of Hong Kong, as articu-
lated in the Basic Law, including the free-
doms of expression, association, and assem-
bly; 
(4) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic 
of 
China 
has 
used 
propaganda, 
disinformation, and censorship in an attempt 
to shape reporting on the Hong Kong pro-
tests, attributing the protests to influence

S1300 
March 3, 2020 
by ‘‘foreign forces’’, and threatening pro-
testers in Hong Kong; 
(5) officials of the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China and the Communist 
Party of China continue to abuse criminal 
law and police power to punish critics and 
‘‘maintain stability’’ with the goal of perpet-
uating 
one-party 
rule, 
often 
targeting 
human rights advocates, religious believers, 
and ethnic minority groups; and 
(6) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China is likely committing crimes 
against humanity; 
Whereas, before the 2008 Summer Olympics 
were held in Beijing, the Department of 
State Country Report on Human Rights 
Practices for 2006 reported that the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China prac-
ticed severe cultural and religious repression 
of minorities, especially of Uyghur individ-
uals in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion, and according to the Department of 
State Country Reports on Human Rights 
Practices for 2018, such repression has inten-
sified since the 2008 Summer Olympics in 
Beijing; 
Whereas four Special Rapporteurs of the 
United Nations have urged the governing au-
thorities in Hong Kong and the People’s Re-
public of China to ensure protestors in Hong 
Kong may fully exercise the right to peace-
fully assemble, including— 
(1) the Special Rapporteur on the pro-
motion and protection of the right to free-
dom of opinion and expression; 
(2) the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders; 
(3) the Special Rapporteur on the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of associa-
tion; and 
(4) the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment; 
Whereas police in Hong Kong have arrested 
more than 6,000 individuals and fired more 
than 16,000 rounds of tear gas during the 
seven months of protests by people of Hong 
Kong seeking to uphold their liberties and 
the autonomy of Hong Kong, as articulated 
in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Re-
public of China (referred to in this preamble 
as the ‘‘Basic Law’’); 
Whereas the report of the Network of Chi-
nese Human Rights Defenders entitled ‘‘De-
fending Rights in a ‘No Rights Zone’: Annual 
Report on the Situation of Human Rights 
Defenders in China (2018)’’ indicates that— 
(1) authorities in the People’s Republic of 
China continue to charge Tibetans with ‘‘in-
citing separatism’’ for expressing political or 
religious dissent and impose heavy prison 
sentences on such individuals; 
(2) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China continues to implement its dra-
conian 2017 cybersecurity law, which author-
izes invasive cyber surveillance and provides 
broad authority to restrict and penalize on-
line expression; 
(3) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China intends to have ‘‘full coverage, 
connectivity, and control’’ of the entire Peo-
ple’s Republic of China by police video sur-
veillance by 2020; and 
(4) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China boldly retaliates against human 
rights advocates for their work upholding 
international 
standards 
and 
cooperating 
with the United Nations human rights mech-
anisms; 
Whereas, in January 2020, the editorial 
board of The Washington Post questioned 
whether the People’s Republic of China 
should ‘‘be allowed to host the 2022 Winter 
Olympics in one city while running con-
centration camps in another’’; and 
Whereas the flagrant human rights abuses 
committed by the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China are inconsistent with 
Olympic values: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) the Senate supports the values of 
Olympism and the principles of Team USA 
with respect to the protection of— 
(A) the rights, safety, and well-being of 
athletes; and 
(B) the integrity of sport; and 
(2) it is the sense of the Senate that, con-
sistent with the principles of the Inter-
national Olympic Committee, unless the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China demonstrates significant progress in 
securing fundamental human rights, includ-
ing the freedoms of religion, speech, move-
ment, association, and assembly, by January 
1, 2021, the International Olympic Committee 
should rebid the 2022 Winter Olympics to be 
hosted by a country that recognizes and re-
spects human rights.

TITLE IV—AMENDMENTS TO THE 
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 
SEC. 4001. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Clean En-
ergy Victory Bond Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 4002. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Potential exists for increasing clean 
and renewable energy production and energy 
efficiency installation in the United States. 
(2) Other nations, including China and Ger-
many, are ahead of the United States in 
manufacturing and deploying various clean 
energy technologies, even though many of 
these technologies were invented in the 
United States. 
(3) Climate change represents an existen-
tial threat to the safety, security, and econ-
omy of the United States. Rapid and robust 
deployment of clean energy will reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the 
effects of climate change on American soci-
ety. 
(4) Many segments of the American public 
want to take charge of efforts to combat the 
effects of climate change and practice re-
sponsible consumer behavior. 
(5) The Office of Energy Efficiency and Re-
newable Energy of the Department of Energy 
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘EERE’’) 
estimates 
that 
taxpayer 
investment 
of 
$12,000,000,000 into the EERE research and de-
velopment portfolio has already yielded an 
estimated net economic benefit to the 
United States of more than $230,000,000,000, 
with an overall annual return on investment 
of more than 20 percent. 
(6) Investments in renewable energy and 
energy efficiency projects in the United 
States create green jobs throughout the Na-
tion. New and innovative jobs could be cre-
ated through expanded government support 
for clean energy and energy efficiency. 
(7) As Americans choose energy efficiency 
and clean energy and transportation, it re-
duces our dependence on foreign oil and im-
proves our energy security. 
(8) Bonds are a low-cost method for encour-
aging clean energy, as they do not require di-
rect budget allocations or expenditures. The 
projects supported through Clean Energy 
Victory Bonds will create jobs and business 
revenues that will increase Federal tax reve-
nues, while simultaneously reducing nation-
wide health and environmental costs in-
curred by the Federal Government. 
(9) Bonds are voluntary measures that 
allow Americans to contribute financially in 
whatever amount is available to them. 
(10) During World War II, over 80 percent of 
American 
households 
purchased 
Victory 
Bonds to support the war effort, raising over 
$185,000,000,000, or over $2,000,000,000,000 in to-
day’s dollars.

the table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place in title I, insert 
the following: 
SEC. 1ll. HEAT EFFICIENCY THROUGH APPLIED 
TECHNOLOGY. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) combined heat and power technology, 
also known as cogeneration, is a technology 
that efficiently produces electricity and 
thermal energy at the point of use of the 
technology; 
(2) by combining the provision of both elec-
tricity and thermal energy in a single step, 
combined heat and power technology makes 
significantly more efficient use of fuel com-
pared to separate generation of heat and 
power, which has significant economic and 
environmental advantages; 
(3) waste heat to power is a technology 
that captures heat discarded by an existing 
industrial process and uses that heat to gen-
erate power with no additional fuel and no 
incremental emissions, reducing the need for 
electricity from other sources and the grid, 
and any associated emissions; 
(4) waste heat or waste heat to power is 
considered renewable energy in 17 States; 
(5)(A) a 2012 joint report by the Depart-
ment of Energy and the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency estimated that by achieving 
the national goal outlined in Executive 
Order 13624 (77 Fed. Reg. 54779) (September 5, 
2012) of deploying 40 gigawatts of new com-
bined heat and power technology by 2020, the 
United States would increase the total com-
bined heat and power capacity of the United 
States by 50 percent in less than a decade; 
and 
(B) additional efficiency would— 
(i) save 1,000,000,000,000,000 BTUs of energy; 
and 
(ii) reduce emissions by 150,000,000 metric 
tons of carbon dioxide annually, a quantity 
equivalent to the emissions from more than 
25,000,000 cars; 
(6) a 2012 report by the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency estimated the amount of 
waste heat available at a temperature high 
enough for power generation from industrial 
and nonindustrial applications represents an 
additional 10 gigawatts of electric gener-
ating capacity on a national basis; 
(7) distributed energy generation, includ-
ing through combined heat and power tech-
nology and waste heat to power technology, 
has ancillary benefits, such as— 
(A) removing load from the electricity dis-
tribution grid; and 
(B) improving the overall reliability of the 
electricity distribution system; and 
(8)(A) a number of regulatory barriers im-
pede broad deployment of combined heat and 
power technology and waste heat to power 
technology; and 
(B) a 2008 study by Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory 
identified 
interconnection 
issues, regulated fees and tariffs, and envi-
ronmental permitting as areas that could be 
streamlined with respect to the provision of 
combined heat and power technology and 
waste heat to power technology.

SEC. ll. CARBON MONOXIDE ALARMS OR DE-
TECTORS IN FEDERALLY ASSISTED 
HOUSING. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) carbon monoxide alarms are not re-
quired by federally assisted housing pro-
grams, when not required by State or local 
codes; 
(2) numerous federally assisted housing 
residents have lost their lives due to carbon 
monoxide poisoning; 
(3) the effects of carbon monoxide poi-
soning occur immediately and can result in 
death in a matter of minutes; 
(4) carbon monoxide exposure can cause 
permanent brain damage, life-threatening 
cardiac complications, fetal death or mis-
carriage, and death, among other harmful 
health conditions; 
(5) carbon monoxide poisoning is especially 
dangerous for unborn babies, children, elder-
ly individuals, and individuals with cardio-
vascular disease, among others with chronic 
health conditions; 
(6) the majority of the 4,600,000 families re-
ceiving Federal housing assistance are fami-
lies with young children, elderly individuals, 
or individuals with disabilities, making 
them especially vulnerable to carbon mon-
oxide poisoning; 
(7) more than 400 people die and 50,000 addi-
tional people visit the emergency room an-
nually as a result of carbon monoxide poi-
soning; 
(8) carbon monoxide poisoning is entirely 
preventable and early detection is possible 
with the use of carbon monoxide alarms; 
(9) the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention warns that carbon monoxide poi-
soning is entirely preventable and rec-
ommends the installation of carbon mon-
oxide alarms; 
(10) the Office of Lead Hazard Control and 
Healthy Homes of the Department of Hous-
ing and Urban Development recommends the 
installation of carbon monoxide alarms as a 
best practice to keep families and individ-
uals safe and to protect health; and 
(11) in order to safeguard the health and 
well-being of tenants in federally assisted 
housing, the Federal Government should 
consider best practices for primary preven-
tion of carbon monoxide-related incidents. 
(b) PUBLIC
HOUSING

TIVE AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS 
CORPORATION. 
(a) FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(A) Rare earth elements are critical for ad-
vanced energy technologies, national de-
fense, and other commercial and industrial 
applications. 
(B) The People’s Republic of China (re-
ferred to in this paragraph as ‘‘China’’) has 
leveraged its monopoly control over the rare 
earth value chain to force corporations from 
the United States, Europe, Japan, and South 
Korea to transfer manufacturing facilities, 
technology, and jobs to China in exchange 
for secure supply contracts. 
(C) The increasingly aggressive mercantile 
behavior of China has led to involuntary 
transfers of technology, manufacturing, and 
jobs, which has resulted in onerous trade im-
balances with the United States and trading 
partners of the United States. 
(D) The Comptroller General of the United 
States has confirmed that the monopoly con-
trol of China over the rare earth value chain 
has resulted in vulnerabilities in the pro-
curement of multiple United States weapons 
systems. 
(E) Direct links exist between rare earth 
mineralogy and thorium. 
(F) Thorium is a radioactive element com-
monly associated with the lanthanide ele-
ments in most rare earth deposits located in 
the United States and elsewhere. 
(G) Regulations regarding thorium rep-
resent a barrier to the development of a rare 
earth industry that is based in the United 
States. 
(H) Meeting the strategic national interest 
objectives of the United States and economic 
and environmental goals are best achieved 
through the creation of a rare earth coopera-
tive. 
(I) A rare earth cooperative could— 
(i) greatly increase the production of rare 
earth elements; 
(ii) ensure environmental safety; and 
(iii) lower the cost of the production and fi-
nancial risks faced by rare earth producers 
in the United States. 
(J) Historically, agricultural and electric 
cooperatives have stood as one of the great-
est success stories of the United States. 
(2) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States to advance domestic re-
fining of rare earth elements and the safe 
storage of thorium in anticipation of the po-
tential future industrial uses of thorium, in-
cluding energy, because— 
(A) thorium has a mineralogical associa-
tion with valuable rare earth elements; 
(B) there is a great need to develop domes-
tic refining capacity to process domestic 
rare earth element deposits; and 
(C) the economy of the United States 
would benefit from the rapid development 
and control of intellectual property relating 
to the commercial development of tech-
nology utilizing thorium.

SECURE FEDERAL LEASES FROM 
ESPIONAGE AND SUSPICIOUS EN-
TANGLEMENTS ACT 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 196, S. 1869. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1869) to require the disclosure of 
ownership of high-security space leased to 
accommodate a Federal agency, and for 
other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate

had been reported from the Committee

mental Affairs, with an amendment to 
strike all after the enacting clause and 
insert in lieu thereof the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as 
the ‘‘Secure Federal Leases from Espionage and 
Suspicious Entanglements Act’’ or the ‘‘Secure 
Federal LEASEs Act’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) the Government Accountability Office has 
reported that the Federal Government often 
leases high-security space from private sector 
landlords; 
(2) the General Services Administration col-
lects highest-level and immediate ownership in-
formation through the System of Award Man-
agement, but it is not currently required to col-
lect beneficial ownership information and lacks 
an adequate system for doing so; 
(3) the General Services Administration and 
Federal agencies with leasing authority may not 
know if foreign owners have a stake in the 
buildings leased by the agencies, either through 
foreign-incorporated legal entities or through 
ownership in United States-incorporated legal 
entities, even when the leased space is used for 
classified operations or to store sensitive data; 
and 
(4) according to a report of the Government 
Accountability Office, dated January 2017, that 
examined the risks of foreign ownership of Gov-
ernment-leased real estate, ‘‘leasing space in 
foreign-owned buildings could present security 
risks such as espionage and unauthorized cyber 
and physical access’’.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1445 
March 3, 2020 
The amendment (No. 1460) was agreed 
to as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the preamble) 
In the second whereas clause of the pre-
amble, strike ‘‘on December 1, 2019’’ and in-
sert ‘‘in early December 2019’’. 
Strike the ninth whereas clause of the pre-
amble and insert the following: 
Whereas the people of China expressed 
their grief and anger on social media after 
the death of Dr. Li with the phrase ‘‘I want 
freedom of speech,’’ which was swiftly 
censored by the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China; 
The 
preamble, 
as 
amended, 
was 
agreed to. 
The resolution, with its preamble, as 
amended, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 497 
Whereas Dr. Li Wenliang was a 34-year-old 
ophthalmologist working in Wuhan, China; 
Whereas research indicates that the first 
patient 
infected 
with 
the 
2019 
novel 
coronavirus (2019–nCoV) exhibited symptoms 
in early December 2019; 
Whereas, in December 2019, Dr. Li notified 
his associates in the medical community in 
China about the outbreak of 2019–nCoV; 
Whereas, after raising concerns about the 
spread of 2019–nCoV, Dr. Li was summoned 
by Chinese officials and forced to sign a 
statement retracting his warnings about the 
virus and confessing that he had spread ille-
gal rumors; 
Whereas Chinese government authorities 
played down dangers to the public for weeks 
as 2019–nCoV continued to spread, with more 
than 42,000 confirmed cases in China alone 
and at least 1,000 deaths reported as of Feb-
ruary 11, 2020; 
Whereas Dr. Li continued to work as an 
ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital 
despite his knowledge of the outbreak, and 
appears to have been infected himself with 
2019–nCoV after coming in contact with a pa-
tient he was treating for glaucoma; 
Whereas, on the morning of February 7, 
2020, in the hospital where he worked, Dr. Li 
Wenliang died after contracting 2019–nCoV; 
Whereas, before he passed away, Dr. Li 
stated, ‘‘If the officials had disclosed infor-
mation about the epidemic earlier, I think it 
would have been a lot better. There should 
be more openness and transparency.’’; 
Whereas the people of China expressed 
their grief and anger on social media after 
the death of Dr. Li with the phrase ‘‘I want 
freedom of speech,’’ which was swiftly 
censored by the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China continues to limit free ex-
pression, and stepped up censorship after on-
line criticism and investigative reports by 
Chinese journalists suggesting that officials 
underestimated and underplayed the threat 
of 2019–nCoV; 
Whereas Freedom House has listed China 
as the ‘‘worst abuser of internet freedom’’ in 
the world for the fourth year in a row, and in 
the aftermath of the outbreak of 2019–nCoV, 
there are numerous and well-documented in-
stances of the ‘‘Great Firewall’’ of China 
suppressing the free flow of critical and 
medically important information about the 
pandemic; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China has endangered the people 
of Taiwan and people around the world by 
using its influence to limit Taiwan’s access 
to the benefits of membership in the World 
Health Organization and the International 
Civil Aviation Organization, particularly 
during the current outbreak; and 
Whereas the World Health Organization 
has declared 2019–nCoV a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the life and contributions of Dr. 
Li Wenliang, and extends heartfelt sympathy 
to his family and to the families of all who 
have passed during this outbreak; 
(2) expresses its support for the people of 
China as they face this unprecedented public 
health challenge; 
(3) expresses gratitude to Dr. Li and all 
Chinese medical personnel and citizens for 
their efforts to spread awareness of 2019– 
nCoV and treat individuals who have con-
tracted the disease; 
(4) calls on the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China and the Communist Party 
of China— 
(A) to be open and transparent in inves-
tigating and responding to 2019–nCoV; 
(B) to ensure that Chinese citizens and the 
international community have free and un-
fettered access, without censorship or social 
media controls, to information about 2019– 
nCoV; 
(C) to cooperate fully with the United 
States Government, including the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, in pro-
viding medical access, sharing information, 
and developing treatment to combat 2019– 
nCoV; 
(D) to cooperate fully with other govern-
ments, especially those in Southeast Asia, 
Africa, Latin America, and other regions 
whose health systems already face high bur-
dens and are operating from a lower base of 
capability, as well as international health 
organizations in combating 2019–nCoV; and 
(E) to cease efforts to exclude Taiwan from 
international organizations, including the 
World Health Organization and the Inter-
national Civil Aviation Organization; 
(5) affirms the vital importance of Dr. Li’s 
belief that ‘‘[t]here should be more openness 
and transparency’’ in China; 
(6) affirms that freedom of expression is a 
social good that enables experts to sound 
public health warnings and helps citizens en-
sure that their government addresses weak-
nesses in crisis response; and 
(7) strongly supports the people of China in 
their demand for freedom of speech.

RECOGNIZING 
STEPHANIE 
BUSIN 
IN HONOR OF WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 3, 2020 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, in 
honor of Women’s History Month, I rise today 
to recognize Stephanie Busin, for her unwav-
ering dedication to her community. She has 
been a steadfast activist supporting children’s 
education initiatives and has left an impressive 
and unforgettable mark on Southern Florida. 
Born in Pahokee, Florida, Stephanie is a 
third generation Hendry County native and has 
spent her life giving back to her community. 
After graduating from Clewiston High School 
in 1996, she enrolled in Santa Fe College in 
Gainesville, Florida. However, her interest in 
journalism brought her home, where she 
joined The Clewiston News staff. It is during 
this time period that she found her passion for 
education, which later led to her becoming an 
integral member of the Hendry County School 
Board in 2014. Presently, she serves as the 
Chairman of Hendry’s District 4 School Board. 
Stephanie has been a passionate advocate 
for raising awareness for Autism Spectrum 
Disorder (ASD) in her community, particularly 
among law enforcement officers. In fact, in 
2017, 
she 
created 
a 
training 
program, 
LAWTISM, which educates officers on how to 
identify and properly respond to people who 
may have ASD. She also championed autism 
awareness in the classroom, by establishing a 
nonprofit that fundraised to create the Edu-
cators Affecting Autism Classroom Grants. 
These grants, which are an award of $250, 
are used to support the sensory and academic 
needs of students who are on the autism 
spectrum. 
Stephanie’s dedication to community service 
is of the highest caliber, and her selfless char-
acter is truly demonstrated in the work she 
has done. It would be remiss to celebrate 
Stephanie without recognizing her loving hus-
band, Tony, and her two greatest treasures, 
her sons Anthony and Baron. The love and 
support Stephanie receives from her family al-
lows her to be a leader and activist in her 
community. 
Madam Speaker, it is truly a privilege to 
honor my good friend, Stephanie Busin, for 
the impressive work she has done for South-
ern Florida. Her commitment, perseverance, 
and drive cannot be matched, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing this re-
markable individual. 
IN CELEBRATION OF BUTLER 
EAGLE’S 150TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MIKE KELLY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 3, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the 150th anniver-
sary of Butler County’s hometown newspaper, 
the Butler Eagle. 
As a life-long resident of Butler, I am proud 
to celebrate a special milestone for our home-
town paper. For 150 years, the Butler Eagle 
has provided residents of Butler County with 
national, state, and local news that we count 
on. 
In the 60s, our family opened the Butler 
Eagle to see how many yards Terry Hanratty 
threw for or how many tackles the Saul broth-
ers had for a loss on a Friday night. The 
Eagle, like many local newspapers across the 
country, is a big part of the community iden-
tity. These publications provide information 
that matters to us that larger, national news 
outlets do not. They tell us stories about 
friends and neighbors and their successes, 
new 
marriages, 
community 
events, 
high 
school sports, and so much more. We can 
count on the Eagle and papers like it across 
our great country to tell us what is happening 
close to home. 
National publications cover what one might 
expect: national politics, Congress, the presi-
dent, and foreign affairs. While it is important 
to know what’s going on in Washington, D.C., 
our system of government was designed to 
give local government a much larger direct im-
pact on the lives of Americans. When local pa-
pers like the Butler Eagle cover mayors, city 
councils, county commissioners, and school 
boards, they perform a vital service that helps 
Americans oversee the elected officials who 
affect their lives far more personally than 
those in our nation’s capital. 
Think about it. Our local zoning commis-
sioners decide what we can build on our own 
land, or what can be built next door to us. City 
councils decide how much to invest in our 
local roads. Reporting on their decisions is 
crucial to functioning municipalities. Without 
local papers like the Butler Eagle, we would 
face difficulty assessing the leadership of our 
locally elected government officials. We would 
also lose a great deal of connectivity with our 
surroundings. Local papers provide a knowl-
edge of and bond with our neighbors. 
So, as we celebrate the Butler Eagle’s 
150th anniversary, I thank the paper for its 
long record of service to the City and County 
of Butler, for informing us about important 
events in our neighborhoods, and holding 
elected officials accountable at all levels of 
government. We appreciate the many past 
and present reporters who take the pulse of 
our communities and convey their findings. In 
doing so, they have helped shape the identity 
of Butler and brought us together as a com-
munity. 
Best wishes for the next 150 years.

RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING 
WORK OF DR. ELISABETH BROWN 
HON. HARLEY ROUDA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 3, 2020 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Dr. Elisabeth Brown for her in-
credible tenure as the President of Laguna 
Greenbelt, Inc. For more than three decades, 
Dr. Brown has led and overseen the creation 
and implementation of new programs that 
positively impact and contribute to our Laguna 
Beach community. 
Dr. Brown has served on the Board of Di-
rectors of Laguna Greenbelt, Inc. since 1980 
and stepped into the role of President just 
seven years later. During her time as Presi-
dent, she has received numerous awards and 
recognitions, including the 2016 Lifetime 
Achievement Award for the League of Con-
servation. 
Dr. Brown has sought to protect the natural 
resources of Orange County while establishing 
educational programs to enhance the public’s 
knowledge on the California Coastal Canyon 
environment. A cornerstone of Dr. Brown’s 
work has been the establishment of a training 
class that taught hundreds of volunteers about 
the native plant habitats and restoration 
projects throughout Orange County. 
I ask all Members to join me in recognizing 
the extraordinary work and contributions of Dr. 
Elisabeth Brown to California’s 48th Congres-
sional District and all of Orange County.

HONORING THE 70TH BIRTHDAY OF 
FRANKLIN DELANO ROZA 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 3, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor my cousin Franklin (Frank) Delano 
Roza on the occasion of his 70th birthday. 
Frank is a beloved husband, grandfather and 
friend to many. 
Franklin (Frank) Delano Roza was born on 
January 30, 1950 to Georgina Cardoso Roza 
and Manuel J. Roza. Frank is the 5th son and 
youngest child in a family of 6 children. As he 
shares a birthday with his parent’s favorite pol-
itician President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he was 
named in his honor. Frank attended American 
Union Elementary School, Hamilton Middle 
School and Fresno High School. After grad-
uating Fresno High School in 1967, he at-
tended classes at Fresno City College and 
served in the United States Army. 
In 1974, Frank began working for Pacifica 
Gas and Electric Company. He was eventually 
assigned to Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power 
Plant in Avila Beach, California and worked 
there until his retirement in 2006. Even after 
his retirement, he continued to go back and 
work outages several times a year. 
In 1983, Frank married the love of his life 
Yvonne, and they have lived on the Central 
California Coast for more than 40 years. 
Through this marriage, Frank has one stepson 
and daughter-in-law Josh and Becky Sexton of 
Coalinga, and is a grandfather to three beau-
tiful granddaughters. 
Frank is the Roza family’s most prolific trav-
eler. As a young man, he backpacked across 
Europe and explored Canada. His travels in-
clude Central America, South America, Eu-
rope, the Azores Islands, and Hawaii. Frank is 
also an avid cyclist who has crossed the 
United States twice, from West to East and 
East to West, while raising money for the Alz-
heimer Association in honor of his mother who 
succumbed to the disease. When Frank is not 
traveling, he is golfing. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Franklin Delano Roza as he 
celebrates his 70th birthday. I ask that you join 
me in wishing Frank continued health and 
happiness.

RECOGNIZING SUSIE V. CASTILLO 
IN HONOR OF WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 3, 2020 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, in 
honor of Women’s History Month, I rise today 
to recognize Susie V. Castillo, whose inspiring 
life journey and determined work ethic has 
had a significant impact on all those around 
her. 
In 1961, her parents and two older brothers 
were forced into exile by the Castro dictator-
ship and had to begin a new life in South Flor-
ida. Very quickly, Susie valued the importance 
of giving back to her community, and as a 
young woman, began working as a secretary 
in the same elementary school where her 
mother taught. This decision started Susie’s 
career of over twenty years dedicated to jobs 
in public service. 
Susie spent time working in Miami-Dade 
County’s Superintendent’s Office and then be-
came a legislative aide for a member of the 
School Board, Mr. Frank Bolanos. This experi-
ence gave her a greater understanding of how 
local policies can help students excel in the 
classroom, parents prepare their children, and 
teachers perform their jobs. It proved bene-
ficial when, in 2004, she served as Chief of 
Staff for the City of Doral’s founding mayor, 
Mr. Juan Carlos Bermudez, for over eight 
years. In this role, she strived to ensure that 
the needs of students were met and devel-
oped city-wide education initiatives, including 
one centered on financial literacy. In 2012, 
she was elected to serve on Miami Dade 
County’s School Board, a position she cur-
rently holds. 
Throughout her eventful life, Susie has prov-
en that she is a strongminded and driven indi-
vidual, even in the most adverse of times. This 
was evident when, her daughter, Andrea, who 
was an aspiring educator, tragically passed 
away at the young age of twenty-one. Susie 
used Andrea’s passing as her compass and 
dedicated herself even more to her commu-
nity. In her daughter’s memory, she created 
the Andrea Castillo Foundation, which gives 
scholarships to students majoring in Education 
at public colleges and universities in Miami- 
Dade. Susie has ensured that her daughter’s 
legacy will not be forgotten; she will live on in 
every student who receives this scholarship. 
Madam Speaker, it has truly been a privi-
lege to work with Susie Castillo over the years 
and I greatly admire her commitment to Miami 
Dade County. Her dedication and unwavering 
spirit, even in the most trying circumstances, 
deserves our respect, and I ask my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing this exceptional indi-
vidual.

HONORING UTAH GOVERNOR GARY 
HERBERT—RECEIVING 
THE 
‘‘GIANT IN OUR CITY’’ AWARD 
HON. BEN McADAMS 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 3, 2020 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Salt Lake Chamber’s 2020 
‘‘Giant in our City’’ Award winner: Utah Gov-
ernor Gary R. Herbert. 
Governor Herbert is currently the nation’s 
longer-serving governor. He has served as 
chair of both the Western Governors Associa-
tion and the National Governors Association. 
During his time in office, he has worked to 
build what is one of the country’s strongest 
economies—as of January, Utah’s unemploy-
ment rate was the lowest ever recorded—at 
2.3 percent. Utah also led the nation for its job 
creation rate in 2019. 
He has defined his mission by ‘‘The Utah 
Way.’’ 
‘‘Our state succeeds because of our people 
and their culture of hard work, innovation, in-
dustry, inclusivity and compassion—that is the 
Utah Way.’’ 
Governor Herbert was born in Utah County, 
where he served as a county commissioner 
for 14 years. He served six years in the Utah 
National Guard and he started a successful 
real estate brokerage and development com-
pany. Governor Herbert served as the past 
president of the Utah Association of Realtors 
and the past president of the Utah Association 
of Counties. 
As governor, he has prioritized public edu-
cation—in a state with large families and many 
children to educate. That’s why his effort to 
build a vibrant economy has been so impor-
tant, since a well-educated work force and 
well-paid jobs go hand-in-hand. 
Governor Herbert has led our state with 
compassion, supporting local efforts to reform 
and improve our homeless services and wel-
coming refugees to Utah. He was recognized 
recently by the Utah Refugee Advisory Board, 
which thanked him for asking the federal gov-
ernment to let Utah take in more refugees. He 
received a letter which said, in part, ‘‘Governor 
Herbert, you have touched the hearts of many 
people in the refugee community by speaking 
out nationally on behalf of—and for standing 
with—Utah refugees.’’ It was signed by 30 
leaders from a variety of Utah refugee groups 
from countries including Somalia, Sudan, Bu-
rundi, Cameroon, Liberia and Congo. 
Governor Herbert’s wife, First Lady Jeanette 
Herbert, has been an equal partner in his 
service. As the owner and operator of a 
childcare center and preschool for 23 years, 
Jeanette focused on an initiative known as 
‘‘Uplift Families’’—with the goal of promoting 
good parenting skills, strengthening families 
and offering resources to parents throughout 
Utah. The Herberts are proud parents of six

HONORING 2019 ‘‘MR. AMIGO’’ 
JULIO CE´ SAR CHA´ VEZ 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 3, 2020 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the Charro Days Fiesta and to 
honor the 2020 ‘‘Mr. Amigo,’’ chosen by the 
Mr. Amigo Association of Brownsville, TX, 
Julio Ce´sar Cha´vez. 
Charro Days dates back to 1937, when the 
citizens of Brownsville organized the event in 
the midst of the Great Depression to celebrate 
the cultural heritage shared between Browns-
ville 
and 
its 
sister 
city,

Tamaulipas, across the border in Mexico. 
Since 1964, the ‘‘Mr. Amigo’’ award has rec-
ognized an outstanding Mexican citizen who 
has made a lasting contribution to the friend-
ship and understanding of the United States 
and Mexico. ‘‘Mr. Amigo’’ acts as an ambas-
sador between the United States and Mexico 
and presides over the annual Charro Days Fi-
esta. 
Julio Ce´sar Cha´vez is a sports legend and 
a champion, both in and out of the ring. Julio 
Ce´sar was born in Ciudad Obrego´n, Sonora, 
but moved with his family at a young age to 
Culiaca´n, Sinaloa. It was there that his fighting 
spirit and drive for personal growth inspired 
him to get into the ring—guided by the dream 
of buying a house for his mother, Don˜a Isabel. 
The ‘‘Sultan of Culiaca´n’’ won six world titles 
in three different divisions in the Super Feath-
erweight, Lightweight, and Light Welterweight 
categories. In the 25 years of his professional 
career he remained undefeated for 13 years, 
he won 31 out of 37 world title bouts, and he 
was able to successfully defend his world 
crowns 27 times. His biggest wins in the ring 
were 
against 
Roger 
Mayweather, 
Juan 
Laporte, Edwin ‘‘Chapo’’ Rosario, Jose´ Luis 
Ramirez, Meldrick Taylor, Hector ‘‘Macho’’ 
Camacho, Greg Haugen and in the rematch 
against Frankie Randall. 
However, Julio Cesar Chavez also faced 
adversity and addiction, but overcame both 
ills. Today, his message is simple, ‘‘if I could 
it, you can too.’’ That phrase served as the 
foundation for his two rehabilitation centers 
Clinica Baja del Sol, one in Tijuana and the 
other in Culiaca´n. In addition to the work he 
performs through his clinics, Julio Ce´sar is 
ambassador of the National Campaign for Pre-
vention and Attention to Addictions. His grand-
daughter Julia, along with his wife Miriam and 
their children Julio, Omar, Cristian and Nicole 
are his inspiration. He is committed to 
helpings others recover from addictions. 
Madam Speaker, I take this opportunity to 
honor the Charro Days Fiesta. Please join me 
in recognizing the importance of this annual 
celebration which continues to strengthen the 
relationship between Brownsville and Mata-
moros, as well as the United States and Mex-
ico.

RECOGNIZING JANET FACE GLASS-
MAN IN HONOR OF WOMEN’S HIS-
TORY MONTH 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 3, 2020 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, in rec-
ognition of Women’s History Month, I rise 
today to honor Janet Face Glassman, whose 
long-term dedication to her community and 
helping other women and girls has had a sig-
nificant impact on Southern Florida. 
Janet was born and raised in Massachu-
setts, where, at a young age, she found a life-
long passion for civic engagement and em-
powering young women. In 1971, she grad-
uated from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, 
with a B.S. in Mathematics. Shortly after, she 
met her husband, Alan, who has been her 
strongest advocate for over forty-four years. 
She spent her professional career working in 
the insurance industry and received her li-
cense to become a Chartered Property Cas-
ualty Underwriter (CPCU) in 1995. 
Janet moved to Naples, Florida in 2010, and 
has been a pillar in her community ever since. 
While she has volunteered with many organi-
zations over the years, some of her most 
impactful work has been with the PACE Cen-
ter for Girls Collier, located in Immokalee. 
PACE is a nationally recognized and highly 
successful program that mentors high-risk 
middle and high school aged girls. Since its 
opening in Immokalee in 1998, PACE has 
helped over 1,200 girls, leaving a lasting im-
pact on their lives. In 2018, she was the spon-
sorship chair for PACE’s annual Love that 
Dress event, which resells gently used 
dresses, shoes, handbags, and other acces-
sories to help PACE continue with their dili-
gent work. Janet passionately believes in 
PACE’s mission and has visited Washington, 
D.C., to meet with Members of Congress to 
further gain support and raise awareness of 
this exceptional organization. In 2019, PACE 
Center for Girls Collier awarded Janet the 
Pacesetter award for her nine years of excep-
tional volunteer and advocacy work. 
Janet’s love for her community knows no 
bounds and is constantly displayed in the 
ways she gives back to others. While she has 
already made a lasting impact on those 
around her, she continues to find ways to be 
a leader and better her community. In March 
of 2018, Janet graduated from the Greater 
Naples Leadership Program, where she and 
other leaders in Collier County learned how to 
best serve and fulfill the needs of their com-
munity. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to have 
such a dedicated community leader in the dis-
trict I serve. Janet Face Glassman’s love for 
service and assisting those around her has 
truly made a difference in Collier County, and 
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
this outstanding individual. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
CAPT. BRIAN F. BOYCE, USN (RET.) 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 3, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Captain Brian F. Boyce, of 
Norfolk, VA, who died peacefully on February 
22, 2020 at the age of 75. 
Brian was born in New York City on Novem-
ber 7, 1944, to Donald Campbell Boyce, from 
Dingwall, Scotland, and Mary Gibbons, from 
New York City. He graduated from Chambers-
burg Area Senior High School in 1962, Cham-
bersburg, PA. 
Upon graduation from the University of 
Notre Dame, Brian entered the U.S. Navy, 
serving 28 years, including hazardous duty in 
several theaters. He commanded Amphibious 
Squadron FIVE, USS DUBUQUE (LPD 8), 
USS MOUNT VERNON (LSD 39), and SWOS 
Coronado. Post-retirement, he worked as a 
trainer in a virtual-reality navigation, seaman-
ship, and ship-handling. He was also an ex-
pert witness in maritime litigation and an acci-
dent reconstruction specialist using computer- 
generated maritime simulations with a soft-
ware application he developed. 
Brian was a loving, supportive, and kind 
husband, father, grandfather, and brother. Re-
spectful of all, he selflessly volunteered his 
time and talents to help others and believed in 
the importance of engaged citizenship. He en-
joyed golf, the outdoors, reading, history, trav-
el, duplicate bridge, and being the family 
handyman. 
He was not the first in his family to serve his 
country. His maternal grandfather, Neil Gib-
bons, an immigrant from Donegal, Ireland, 
served in the U.S. Navy and as a Sergeant in 
the New York City Police Department, where 
he lost his life in the line of duty. In later 
years, Brian, an avid genealogist, revived the 
memory of his grandfather by researching the 
details of his military service and the accident 
that resulted in his tragic death. 
Brian is survived by Pam, his wife of 51 
years, originally from Greensburg, PA; children 
Suzanne, of San Carlos, CA; John, of Alexan-
dria, VA; and Tom, of Pittsburgh, PA; grand-
children Jimmy, Ben, Dava, and Mairin; and 
siblings Neil, of New York City; Bobby, of Wal-
lingford, PA; Mary Jane, of Middle Haddam, 
CT; Margaret Ann, of Tolland, MA; and Barry, 
of Halifax, Nova Scotia. His eldest brother, 
Donald, died in 1994. 
I am very proud of a long-time friend of 
Brian’s brother, Barry. My deepest sympathies 
go out to Barry, his entire family, and to all 
whose lives were touched by Brian.

Fresno, California and attended California 
State University, Fresno. He comes from a 
family of farmers, working in Central California 
for over 100 years. Don’s farming experience 
started in 1982 in Westlands, south of Three 
Rocks, California. He grows almonds, wine 
grapes, and pomegranates alongside his two 
sons and daughter. 
He has been heavily involved in career-re-
lated board positions, including banking, insur-
ance, agriculture and water. He served as a 
director of Westlands since 2008 and was 
elected president in 2011. Don served on the 
Valley Children’s Hospital Foundation Board 
and has been actively involved with the Fres-
no Catholic Diocese. He chaired for the Step 
Forward campaign for San Joaquin Memorial 
High School for their new science wing and li-
brary. 
As president of the largest public irrigation 
district in the United States, Don worked to 
promote more transparency and better deci-
sion-making. He helped develop a steady 
water supply to farms in Fresno and Kings 
counties, integral for farming. Under Don’s 
leadership, the district negotiated revisions to 
the Coordinated Operations Agreement, con-
verting the district’s water service contract to a 
repayment contract, and developed a ground-
water sustainability plan. Don crafted imme-
diate solutions and worked directly with mem-
bers of both the House of Representatives 
and Senate to find pragmatic solutions that 
benefit the state of California. For example, he 
assisted with the 2016 Water Infrastructure 
Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act), 
which helped improve the nation’s drinking 
water infrastructure. 
Without a doubt, Don Peracchi has made a 
big impact on resolving California water 
issues. Tom Birmingham, the general man-
ager of the district, commends Peracchi for 
leading the district through difficult times, in-
cluding the drought and regulatory that se-
verely reduced water supply in Central Cali-
fornia. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing the service of Mr. Don 
Peracchi and wish him the best in his well-de-
served retirement.

who are being honored by Keshet at its an-
nual gala on March 15, 2020 for their commu-
nity leadership. 
Susie has been an early childhood educator 
for 30 years and anchors the kindergarten

Michael’s career began as a prosecutor and

also an Administrative Law Judge and a Spe-

Michael and Susie share a passion for

honor the service of Katherine MacAulay, who 
recently retired from her role as Executive Di-
rector of the Northeast Indiana Chapter of the 
American Red Cross, where she served for 
forty years. 
Katherine’s lifelong desire to help and serve

which our region and state are forever grate-
ful. Her dedication to the lives and struggles of 
others has earned her three Red Cross 
awards, the lasting respect of her peers, and 
the gratitude of countless men and women 
whose lives have been forever changed by 
her selflessness. 
From her beginnings as an administrative 
assistant at the Red Cross, Katherine rose 
through the ranks after years of hard work 
and, above all, a desire for service. For a 
time, she worked with my wife, Amanda, and 
it was then we witnessed firsthand Katherine’s 
commitment to her community. Though she 
will no longer be with the Red Cross, her spirit 
of service there will serve as a proud example 
for others and her life’s work will have an im-

Anthony Eugene ‘‘Gene’’ Roza was born on 
January 24, 1940 to Georgina Cardoso Roza 
and Manuel J. Roza. In 1950, the Roza family 
moved to Fresno, California where Gene at-
tended American Union Elementary School

Navy. He continued to serve for another four 
years until his honorable discharge in 1964. 
Gene began working for Pacific Telephone

retired. After retiring, he began his second ca-
reer in real estate sales. During his time work-
ing for telephone companies, he was a union

CHESAPEAKE BAY GATEWAYS AND 
WATERTRAILS NETWORK REAU-
THORIZATION ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and 
Watertrails Reauthorization Act (H.R. 2427). I 
am an original cosponsor of this legislation. 
This legislation would reauthorize the Chesa-
peake Bay Gateways Program for six years, 
providing continued congressional support to 
the National Park Service (NPS) as it partners 
with state and local governments to promote 
public access to the Chesapeake Bay, which 
is the nation’s largest estuary and spans six 
states and my own district, the District of Co-
lumbia. Nearly 98 percent of the Bay’s vast 
shoreline is privately owned, with only a small 
portion available for public use. The Chesa-
peake Bay Gateways Program helps to maxi-
mize the effectiveness of public access points 
to the Bay by providing resources for infra-
structure improvements, signage, exhibits and 
public education. The Chesapeake Bay Gate-
ways and Watertrails network includes over 
170 gateways, including parks, wildlife ref-
uges, maritime museums, historic sites and 
watertrails, which serve as points of recreation 
and exploration along the Bay. 
The history of the Bay is rich, and gateways 
allow the public to engage with the life of the 
Bay through learning about its history, ecology 
and people. For example, the Captain John 
Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail al-
lows visitors to retrace the journey Captain 
John Smith and fellow colonists took when 
they arrived at the Chesapeake Bay in 1607. 
Through over 3,000 miles spanning Virginia, 
Maryland, Delaware and the District, visitors 
can experience the sights and sounds of the 
trail both by water and land. Another key point 
in the gateway system is the 125-mile Harriet 
Tubman Underground Railroad Scenic Byway. 
Visitors can explore the byway via car and 
learn about Harriet Tubman’s upbringing in 
Maryland’s Eastern Shore and view historic 
sites important to her legacy. Other attractions 
of note include the Pamunkey Indian Reserva-
tion, the George Washington Birthplace Na-
tional Monument and Kingman and Heritage 
Islands Park in the District. 
The preservation of these sites, and the nu-
merous other gateways along the Bay, is crit-
ical to the NPS’s mission of maintaining the 
national park system and preserving the leg-
acies of the communities in which parks and 
monuments are located. I am proud to support 
this legislation and know that it will greatly 
benefit the District, as well as the broader Bay 
region and visitors to these important sites. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MAYOR KEN JOE MA’A˚ N˜ O ADA 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 3, 2020 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a dedicated public servant, a 
beloved husband, a loving father, and a dear 
friend to all who knew him. It is a privilege to 
recognize the life and legacy of Mayor Ken 
Joe Ma’a˚n˜o Ada, the 2nd eldest son of Roland 
and Louisa M. Ada and is survived by his wife 
Estelle Borja Marie Alig and his two children, 
Anchor Sway and Levi Knox Ada. 
A resident of Yon˜a, on the beautiful island 
of Guam, he graduated from the Guam Ad-
ventist Academy and pursued a Bachelor of 
Science in Public Administration from the Uni-
versity of Guam in 2004. He then joined the 
United States Merchant Marines, which en-
abled him to travel to many countries. He also 
lived in Louisiana, Maryland, and Puerto Rico 
while attached to the USNS Bob Hope. 
Ken Joe pursued his master’s degree in 
Public Administration at the University of 
Guam in 2008 and received the Academic Ex-
cellence Award. In 2012, he was elected 
Mayor of his home village, Yon˜a, and served 
from 2013 to 2017. 
After his tenure as Mayor, naturally posi-
tioning himself to influence others positively, 
Ken Joe went on to teach at the University of 
Guam. Aspired to put his vision to greater use, 
he ran for Senator in the 35th Guam Legisla-
ture. 
Ken Joe was more than all of these to 
many, including myself. He was, first and fore-
most, a light in the lives of everyone privileged 
to share in his embrace. 
I extend my deepest condolences to his wife 
Estelle, his two children, Anchor Sway and 
Levi Knox, extended family members, and 
dear friends. 
Ken Joe was genuinely a kind spirit. His im-
pact, vision, and passion for the community 
will forever fill our hearts.
