DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER

The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Loving God, thank You for giving us 
another day. 
We turn to You, much as the Psalm-
ist did of old: 
‘‘Though we walk in the midst of 
dangers, You guard our lives when our 
enemies rage. You stretch out Your 
hand. Your right hand saves us.’’ 
And, again: ‘‘We are surrounded by 
enemies, who are like lions hungry for 
human flesh. . . . Show Your greatness 
in the sky, O God, and Your glory over 
all of the Earth.’’ 
And yet again: ‘‘Look! Your enemies 
are in an uproar, and those who hate 
You have raised their head. Against 
Your people they devise deceptive 
schemes, 
and 
they 
plot 
together 
against the people You treasure.’’ 
We say, ‘‘In God We Trust,’’ and 
claim to be Your special blessing so 
many times. Your people turn to You 
now, as the enemies of coronavirus and 
a brutal economy besiege us. 
Show Your greatness, O God, and 
bless the Members of Congress with the 
wisdom and courage to address with 
authority these dangers. 
With Your grace, give us reason to 
proclaim Your presence and protection 
in our time of need. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

HONORING UTAH FIREFIGHTERS’ 
BATTLE AGAINST KNOLLS FIRE 
(Mr. MCADAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
MCADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Utah’s hot, dry summers bring with 
them risks to lives and property due to 
wildfires. 
Our first and last line of defense 
against this risk is the skill, dedica-
tion, and courage of firefighters from 
across our State. Sometimes we may 
take their efforts for granted until we 
hear about a particular act of valor, as 
in Utah’s firefighters’ recent battle 
against the Knolls fire in Saratoga 
Springs. 
So far this season, Utah communities 
have seen 650 fires, which have forced 
evacuations across the State. The city 
of Saratoga Springs and other sur-
rounding communities faced some of 
the worst of it so far, with 13,000 resi-
dents forced to evacuate their homes 
due to the Knolls fire. 
For 7 days and nights, in extreme 
temperatures and erratic winds, 200 
firefighters worked tirelessly to pro-
tect the community and our residents. 
The fire consumed over 13,000 acres of 
land, but due to their extraordinary ef-
forts, only one home was lost to the 
flames. 
Wildfire season continues, but what 
we have shown with the Knolls fire is 
that local, State, and Federal resources 
in coordination can minimize damage 
and save lives. 
I am grateful to the brave men and 
women who suit up for these dangerous

HIGHLIGHTING OPERATION WARP 
SPEED 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, America is leading the way in 
coronavirus vaccine research. 
Under the direction of President 
Trump, the Department of Health and 
Human Services and the Department of 
Defense formed a historic partnership 
to accelerate the development of a safe 
coronavirus vaccine. 
Around the country, Operation Warp 
Speed is charting a new path and 
breaking barriers to achieve safe and 
effective results for the American peo-
ple. 
Thanks to Americans’ unparalleled 
ingenuity and drive, we are better posi-
tioned to develop therapeutics and a 
vaccine. The world is watching. 
The Chinese Communist Party al-
ready has been caught attempting to 
steal American coronavirus vaccine re-
search. It is key that we protect our 
groundbreaking research and keep our 
country on the road to recovery. 
f 
CALLING FOR BOLD ACTION ON 
STIMULUS PACKAGE 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, this 
week, the Senate Republicans allowed 
expanded Federal unemployment bene-
fits to expire and unveiled a grossly in-
adequate counter to the HEROES Act 
titled the HEALS Act. 
The HEALS Act slashes expanded 
Federal employment benefits by $400 a 
week during a time when families need 
our support the most. 
Even after some States have gradu-
ally reopened, the economy has not 
made a miraculous comeback. Millions 
of workers are still out of work, and 
too many of them do not have a job to 
return to. 
Workers are relying on these unem-
ployment benefits to cover basic life 
necessities while our economy recov-
ers. 
The HEALS Act is a moral failure. It 
puts corporations first instead of help-
ing the people we were elected to serve 
or supporting the local governments 
battling this crisis. 
This is not a time to play politics. 
We have to be bold and act with ur-
gency. 
f 
HONORING GRADUATES OF FIRST 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
OF 
GEORGIA 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the stu-
dents of Georgia’s First Congressional 
District who recently graduated. 
Social 
distancing 
due 
to 
the 
coronavirus led to most graduations 
being canceled, but there have been 
virtual, drive-through, and in-person 
ceremonies throughout the summer. I 
am especially thankful for the hard-
working 
school 
administrators 
and 
teachers across the First District who 
have made sure students receive the 
recognition they so richly deserve. 
For example, Effingham County’s 
school administrators went above and 
beyond in their efforts. They allowed 
for 
380 
high 
school 
seniors 
at 
Effingham County High School and 360 
at 
South 
Effingham 
County 
High 
School to participate in a drive- 
through graduation that gave seniors 
the opportunity to drive through the 
campus and jump out of their cars, to 
have their photos taken, and receive 
their diplomas. 
Although students across the country 
have had to endure the many chal-
lenges which have come with this na-
tional pandemic and have been held 
back from high school and college tra-
ditions like graduation ceremonies, 
their resilience and perseverance will 
promise them success and a bright fu-
ture. 
f 
CELEBRATING LIBERIAN 
INDEPENDENCE DAY 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the Liberian 
community and to bring attention to 
an issue that Liberian refugees are ex-
periencing in my district and across 
the country. 
In December 2019, as part of the 
NDAA, we passed the Liberian Refugee 
Immigration 
Fairness 
Act, 
which 
would provide a pathway to citizenship 
to 10,000 Liberians who have resided in 
this country legally for years, with a 1- 
year window to accomplish this. 
However, 
between 
administrative 
delays in publishing the rules to obtain 
this relief, and pandemic closures, 8 
months have passed without a single 
application being processed. 
The House Judiciary Committee held 
a hearing with USCIS this week to find 
out why, and we did not receive an-
swers. We are a nation of immigrants, 
immigrants who enrich our commu-
nities 
and 
represent 
exactly 
what 
makes our country great. 
I am proud to represent one of the 
largest 
Liberian-American 
commu-
nities in our country and just this 
weekend was honored to celebrate Li-
berian Independence Day with them. 
f 
HONORING VICTIMS OF DAYTON, 
OHIO, MASS SHOOTING 
(Mr. TURNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, last 
year, on August 4, 2019, around 1 a.m., 
a gunman opened fire on a crowded 
street in the Oregon district in Dayton, 
Ohio. 
The police officers at the scene ran 
toward the danger. Within a mere 32 
seconds, because of the courageous acts 
of the police officers, the shooter was 
dead. Hundreds of lives were saved. 
A year later, our community is still 
reeling from this senseless act of evil. 
Even with the police’s quick action, 
nine lives were lost: 
Lois Oglesby 
Megan Betts 
Saeed Saleh 
Derrick Fudge 
Nicholas Cumer 
Thomas McNichols 
Beatrice Warren-Curtis 
Monica Brickhouse 
Logan Turner 
My community remains thankful for 
the quick action of the Dayton police 
officers. 
f 
THANKING ZVERSE 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, during these uncer-
tain times, it is inspiring to see our 
communities come together to help 
one another. 
I am thankful to ZVerse in Columbia 
for their efforts to help our citizens to 
be safe and healthy. ZVerse is cur-
rently using their advanced technology 
to meet the urgent needs to shield 
healthcare heroes fighting the Wuhan 
virus. 
Through 
this 
effort, 
ZVerse 
can 
produce 1 million engineered ZShields 
per week. I am grateful for the success 
of founder and CEO John Carrington, 
with President David Craig; board 
members Hugh Evans, Wei-Chun Tai, 
and Scot Wingo; and adviser Tom 
Kurke in fighting against this dev-
astating disease. 
I look forward to thanking ZVerse 
during the annual bus tour of the Sec-
ond District. I am grateful for the op-
portunity to recognize the important 
work and citizens I represent. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Our sympathy to the family and 
friends of Herman Cain from Atlanta.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4195 
July 31, 2020 
H. RES. 1074 
Resolved, (1) That the House adopt the Re-
port of the Committee on Ethics dated July 
30, 2020, In the Matter of Allegations Relat-
ing to Representative David Schweikert. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Florida is recognized for 1 
hour. 
b 0915 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an equal amount of time to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. MARCH-
ANT), the ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Ethics, for purposes of de-
bate only, and I ask unanimous con-
sent that he be permitted to control 
that time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, as chairman of the 
Committee on Ethics, I rise in support 
of a resolution for Representative 
DAVID
SCHWEIKERT
of Arizona to be 
reprimanded by the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
One of our most basic obligations as 
Members of Congress is to adhere to 
the principle that public office is a 
public trust. To uphold that trust and 
to maintain civic confidence in the in-
tegrity of this body, we, as Members, 
have bound ourselves by certain stand-
ards of official conduct. 
Our Constitution vests the House 
with the responsibility for self-dis-
cipline and self-accountability to those 
ethical standards. The Committee on 
Ethics, whose membership is evenly di-
vided between Republicans and Demo-
crats and whose work is supported by 
nonpartisan staff, is charged with: en-
forcing the laws and rules governing 
our official conduct; investigating alle-
gations that those laws and rules have 
been violated; and, where appropriate, 
making recommendations to the House 
for the disposition of such investiga-
tions. We are here today to fulfill that 
charge. 
Our committee began reviewing alle-
gations 
involving 
Representative 
SCHWEIKERT
after public reports de-
tailed potential misconduct by him and 
his former chief of staff, who is no 
longer employed by the House. 
In 2018, the Office of Congressional 
Ethics sent two separate referrals re-
garding Representative SCHWEIKERT to 
the Ethics Committee for further re-
view. Those referrals included: trou-
bling allegations of systemic campaign 
finance violations and reporting errors 
by Representative SCHWEIKERT’s au-
thorized campaign committees; allega-
tions of misuse of his Members’ Rep-
resentational Allowance, or MRA, for 
unofficial purposes; and evidence that 
he pressured his official staff to per-
form campaign work. 
During the 115th Congress, the com-
mittee impaneled an investigative sub-
committee to lead a bipartisan review 
of these allegations. At the start of the 
116th Congress, the committee reestab-
lished that evenly divided bipartisan 
panel and appointed Representative 
DEAN
PHILLIPS
of Minnesota as its 
chair, along with Representative BILL 
FLORES of Texas, Representative JAMIE 
RASKIN of Maryland, and Representa-
tive JOHN KATKO of New York. 
The subcommittee, which was capa-
bly supported by the committee’s pro-
fessional, 
nonpartisan 
investigative 
staff, took testimony from 18 witnesses 
and reviewed several hundred thousand 
pages of documents. The investigative 
subcommittee also heard from Rep-
resentative SCHWEIKERT
himself and 
considered his views and interpretation 
of the evidence without prejudgment. 
Upon completing its exhaustive in-
vestigation, the subcommittee unani-
mously concluded that there was sub-
stantial reason to believe that Rep-
resentative SCHWEIKERT’s conduct vio-
lated various House rules, the Code of 
Ethics for Government service, Federal 
laws, and other applicable standards. 
On June 30, 2020, the investigative 
subcommittee unanimously adopted a 
Statement of Alleged Violations, or 
SAV, detailing 11 separate violations 
and the facts giving rise to those viola-
tions. 
As set forth in counts 1 through 6 of 
the SAV, between 2010 and 2017, Rep-
resentative 
SCHWEIKERT’s 
campaign 
committees erroneously disclosed or 
failed to disclose hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars in loans that were 
made or obtained for the benefit of his 
congressional campaigns, including a 
fictional $100,000 loan that purported to 
be sourced from personal funds. His 
campaign committees also failed to re-
port or falsely reported hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in campaign dis-
bursements and contributions. 
For those cumulative and sustained 
acts, Representative SCHWEIKERT vio-
lated: Federal Election Commission 
Act reporting requirements; clause 1 of 
the Code of Official Conduct of House 
rule XXIII, which requires Members of 
this House to behave at all times in a 
manner that reflects creditably on this 
House; and the Code of Ethics for Gov-
ernment Service. 
Count 7 addresses conduct by Rep-
resentative SCHWEIKERT’s former chief 
of staff, who made hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars in impermissible out-
lays 
on 
behalf 
of 
Representative 
SCHWEIKERT’s 
campaign 
committees 
over a 7-year period. Even though these 
outlays were eventually reimbursed by 
the campaign, they amounted to im-
permissible 
campaign 
contributions 
under Federal law. 
For knowing of this practice as it 
was ongoing but failing to prevent it, 
Representative 
SCHWEIKERT
violated 
clause 1 of House rule XXIII and the 
Code of Ethics for Government Service. 
As detailed in count 8, between 2011 
and 2018, Representative SCHWEIKERT 
converted campaign funds for personal 
purposes, primarily by accepting per-
sonal items from several staff members 
that were later reimbursed using cam-
paign funds. 
This conduct violated: Federal elec-
tion law and regulations; clause 6 of 
House rule XXIII, which states cam-
paign funds must be kept separate and 
cannot be converted to personal use; 
and the Code of Ethics for Government 
Service. 
Count 9 addresses Representative 
SCHWEIKERT’s misuse of official re-
sources—including official funds, staff 
time, and congressional office space— 
for unofficial and campaign purposes 
between 2011 and 2017. 
By misusing his MRA and failing to 
provide necessary oversight over its 
use, Representative SCHWEIKERT
vio-
lated 31 U.S. Code, section 1301, clause 
1 of House rule XXIII, and the Code of 
Ethics for Government Service. 
As set forth in count 10, Representa-
tive SCHWEIKERT violated clause 1 of 
House rule XXIII by pressuring his 
former chief of staff to fundraise for his 
campaigns and fostering an office envi-
ronment in which congressional staff 
felt pressured to perform campaign 
work. 
Finally, as detailed in count 11, Rep-
resentative SCHWEIKERT violated clause 
1 of House rule XXIII by failing to exer-
cise the proper candor and due dili-
gence necessary in responding to these 
allegations, including a finding by this 
investigative subcommittee that cer-
tain aspects of his testimony lacked 
credibility. 
Under House and committee rules, a 
Member confronted with a Statement 
of Alleged Violations may either chal-
lenge the allegations with a public 
hearing 
of 
an 
adjudicatory 
sub-
committee or, instead, reach a nego-
tiated resolution with the investigative 
subcommittee. 
In 
this 
instance, 
Representative 
SCHWEIKERT, with the assistance of his 
counsel, negotiated a resolution in 
which he admitted to all 11 counts in a 
Statement of Alleged Violations. He 
also agreed to waive his rights to any 
additional process, including his right 
to an adjudicatory hearing. 
For his misconduct, Representative 
SCHWEIKERT agreed to accept a sanc-
tion of reprimand by the House as well 
as a $50,000 fine to be paid to the 
United States Treasury. 
The 
investigative 
subcommittee 
carefully considered whether censure, 
rather than a reprimand, befitted Rep-
resentative 
SCHWEIKERT’s 
egregious 
conduct. Ultimately, the bipartisan 
subcommittee agreed to this nego-
tiated sanction of a monetary fine and 
public reprimand by his colleagues, in 
large part because of Representative 
SCHWEIKERT’s willingness to accept re-
sponsibility for his own misconduct. 
On July 29, our bipartisan Ethics 
Committee 
unanimously 
voted 
to 
adopt 
the 
subcommittee’s 
rec-
ommendations and transmit to the 
House the resolution currently under 
consideration. 
Yesterday 
morning, 
Ranking Member MARCHANT and I filed

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4196 
July 31, 2020 
the report of the investigative sub-
committee, 
accompanying 
exhibits, 
Representative SCHWEIKERT’s respon-
sive views, and the materials provided 
to the committee by the Office of Con-
gressional Ethics in its referrals. I urge 
all of my colleagues, if they have not 
done so already, to carefully read those 
materials. 
As with every investigative report 
our committee issues, the report in 
this matter explains when and why cer-
tain 
conduct 
may 
implicate 
laws, 
House rules, or other ethical standards. 
Some of Representative SCHWEIKERT’s 
gravest violations arose from direct 
misconduct by him. Because of Rep-
resentative SCHWEIKERT’s own delays 
and posture toward this investigation, 
many of the most serious campaign fi-
nance violations are also now beyond 
the statute of limitations for civil en-
forcement, leaving the House as the 
only body to bring accountability to 
bear on his conduct. 
The bipartisan subcommittee unani-
mously recommended, and our full 
committee unanimously agreed, that 
such conduct with respect to our inves-
tigation should itself be sanctioned. 
Other violations arose from Rep-
resentative SCHWEIKERT’s inattention 
to, or poor supervision of, staff under 
his supervision. For example, when 
asked 
by 
the 
investigative 
sub-
committee about one particular loan to 
his campaign and whether he received 
any guidance on how to report it, Rep-
resentative SCHWEIKERT said this: ‘‘And 
this may be my sin, I didn’t ask. I 
just—I assumed. I didn’t even assume. I 
didn’t think about it.’’ 
If Members take just one lesson from 
this case, let it be this: It is unaccept-
able for us, as public officeholders, not 
to think about our ethical obligations. 
As Members of Congress, we all have an 
affirmative duty to ensure that we, and 
all who work under our supervision, 
comply with the laws, regulations, and 
ethical rules governing our official and 
campaign activities. 
The investigative subcommittee’s re-
port included several advisory rec-
ommendations that the committee will 
seek to implement to provide the 
House with more specific and emphatic 
guidance on some of the issues in this 
matter. So I expect that this case will 
serve to better educate all Members on 
their ethical responsibilities. 
Above all, the proposed sanction, 
which was unanimously approved by 
both the investigate subcommittee and 
the full Committee on Ethics, will af-
firm this body’s unified commitment 
to maintaining the highest level of in-
tegrity. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time so that the distin-
guished ranking member of the Ethics 
Committee, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. MARCHANT), may make any com-
ments that he may have. 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DEUTCH), for yielding the time to 
our side. I want to thank the chairman 
for his service to the House. I have ap-
preciated working with him in Con-
gress and look forward to our contin-
ued service in the next few months. 
The Ethics Committee is the only 
evenly divided committee in the House. 
We are a consensus-based committee. 
Through the hard work of many Mem-
bers and professional staff of the Ethics 
Committee, we have brought forward 
this report today by unanimous vote in 
the committee regarding our fellow 
House Member, Representative DAVID 
SCHWEIKERT of Arizona. 
The Ethics Committee has been en-
trusted to fulfill the constitutional ob-
ligation and responsibility for admon-
ishing Members and staff when appro-
priate. This is not a duty that we take 
lightly—far from it—but it is essential 
in maintaining the public’s trust of our 
Chamber. 
I want to thank the four Members 
who served on the investigative sub-
committee. This was no easy burden on 
the investigative subcommittee, led by 
Congressman DEAN PHILLIPS and Mr. 
BILL FLORES as the chairman and rank-
ing member of the panel. They were 
joined by Congressman JAMIE RASKIN 
and Congressman JOHN KATKO. 
Collectively, the investigative sub-
committee met 22 times during this 
116th Congress and four times in the 
previous Congress. They reviewed over 
200,000 pages of evidence and materials 
and conducted 18 witness interviews. 
The members took their charge with 
great care and diligence to ensure a 
thorough and fair process, and I thank 
them for that. They worked through 
some very complex material and have 
produced today’s report. I join the 
chairman in thanking them for their 
service. 
I encourage all Members and staff to 
read the report, as it contains signifi-
cant guidance on proper use of the 
Members’ Representational Allowance, 
also known as the MRA; the reporting 
of campaign funds; the proper use of of-
ficial resources; and financial disclo-
sure. 
The gentleman from Arizona and his 
legal counsel have participated in this 
lengthy process with both the inves-
tigative subcommittee and the full 
Ethics Committee. It now rests with 
the House to accept this report and its 
recommendations, and I support its 
swift and favorable passage this morn-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
PHILLIPS) for any comments he may 
have. The gentleman ably served as the 
chairman of the investigative sub-
committee, and I appreciate his leader-
ship. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member MARCHANT and 
Chairman DEUTCH for their principled 
leadership on the Ethics Committee 
and for their reflections on our solemn 
duties of self-discipline, self-account-
ability, and self-governance. 
There is no joy in reprimanding one 
of our colleagues, for a transgression 
by one of us is a stain on all of us. 
Whether one takes an oath of office as 
a politician, a police officer, or a public 
official, we are duty-bound to hold our-
selves to the highest standards of con-
duct and serve as role models for our 
Nation. 
During a remarkably difficult and di-
visive period of American history, I am 
proud to have chaired a bipartisan in-
vestigative subcommittee comprised of 
two Republicans—Representatives BILL 
FLORES
and JOHN
KATKO—and two 
Democrats—Representative 
JAMIE 
RASKIN and me. 
On most days, an aisle separates us, 
but there was not a moment of dis-
tance between us during our work on 
this subcommittee. From day one, we 
were unified and unwavering in our 
pursuit of truth and commitment to 
objectivity, none of which would have 
been possible without the remarkable, 
nonpartisan Ethics Committee staff, 
who conducted this investigation with 
integrity, professionalism, and extraor-
dinary patience. 
For that, the entire House joins me 
in expressing gratitude to Tom Rust, 
Brittney Pescatore, Janet Foster, Zeke 
Ross, Danielle Appleman, and Caroline 
Taylor for their principled service and 
diligent work. 
In closing, it is my hope that every 
one of our colleagues takes the time to 
read our report, reflect on the lessons 
of this case, and recommit to acting 
creditably on the people’s House and 
the values on which it stands. 
b 0930 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. KATKO). 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today regarding the determination by 
the Committee on Ethics on the matter 
regarding DAVID SCHWEIKERT, our col-
league. 
As I was preparing my remarks 
today, I thought about my second or 
third day in Congress when I was 
standing at the back of the well look-
ing out at this grand room. Speaker 
Boehner came up to me. And Speaker 
Boehner said to me, You are a pros-
ecutor, right? 
And I said, Yes. 
And he said, You have done it for 20 
years in the Federal system? 
And I said, Yes. 
He said, Well, you are going to be one 
of the designated prosecutors in case 
someone has an ethics issue. You are 
going to be one of the ones we are 
going to use. And he walked away. 
And as he walked away, I thought 
about two things: I thought, I hope it 
never happens that they may need my 
services. And an honor it was, but re-
gardless of the honor it was that he 
tapped me. 
And the second thing was about what 
a privilege it is to be in the House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4197 
July 31, 2020 
Whether Republican or Democrat, we 
all have the great privilege of serving 
in the United States House of Rep-
resentatives. And with that privilege 
comes great responsibility to abide by 
the rules of this institution, which are 
in place so that we may best serve our 
constituents and our country. 
While there is no joy in bringing this 
action to the floor today, as my col-
league and friend, Dean, stated, I ap-
preciate the bipartisan work done by 
the members who served on this sub-
committee. Moreover, I applaud the 
diligence of the nonpartisan staff mem-
bers who Dean named, and who worked 
tirelessly throughout this process to 
ensure fairness and to uphold the 
standards imposed upon every Member 
of Congress. 
The 
investigation 
was 
conducted 
thoroughly and without one hint of 
bias. Importantly, I believe the bipar-
tisan manner in which it was con-
ducted demonstrates that the processes 
in place to hold Members of Congress 
accountable do indeed work and are 
taken very seriously by both parties. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I com-
mend everybody who was involved in 
this investigation, and I commend the 
House for having these rules. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, 
the ranking member urges the House 
to vote ‘‘aye’’ on this matter, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
In closing, I again thank each of the 
members who served on the investiga-
tive 
subcommittees 
that 
were 
impaneled in this matter during the 
115th and 116th Congresses. 
The Committee on Ethics contin-
ually strives to enhance the reputation 
of this body and ensure that Members, 
as required by House rules and the 
Code of Official Conduct, always act in 
a manner that reflects creditably on 
the House. 
Representatives 
PHILLIPS, 
FLORES, 
RASKIN, and KATKO, your work on this 
case has been instrumental to that 
broader effort, and we are most grate-
ful for your service. 
Madam Speaker, I am also appre-
ciative and grateful for the ranking 
member, Mr. MARCHANT, and his dedi-
cation to upholding the integrity of 
this House and the principles that he 
brings to bear as he serves in a leader-
ship position on the House Committee 
on Ethics. I am grateful to all of the 
other Ethics Committee members, my 
colleagues, for their work on this mat-
ter, and all of the others that we have 
handled in this Congress. 
I thank my personal staff, Josh 
Rogin and David Arrojo; and Mr. 
MARCHANT’s staff, Scott Cunningham 
and Chris Donesa, for their commit-
ment to ensuring that this work be 
done fairly. I also recognize the board 
and staff of the Office of Congressional 
Ethics for their contributions to this 
investigation. 
Lastly, as Mr. PHILLIPS referenced, 
enormous thanks are due to our non-
partisan professional committee staff 
for their tireless work on this inves-
tigation and their dedicated service 
every day to this House. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, I note that 
while the committee’s investigative 
work may garner more public atten-
tion, the committee’s nonpartisan, ad-
visory staff is always available to an-
swer any ethics-related questions, to 
hold special training sessions for Mem-
bers and employees, in addition to the 
mandated annual ethics trainings, and 
to issue advisory opinions upon re-
quest. 
I encourage all Members of this 
House, all candidates and Congres-
sional staff, to avail themselves of our 
committee’s resources to help them 
satisfy their ethical obligations and to 
avoid the mistakes like those by Rep-
resentative SCHWEIKERT that bring us 
to the floor of the House today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘aye’’ as well, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered. 
There was no objection. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials as well on 
the matter just under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, as the 
Members know and as the country 
knows, we have failed to reach an 
agreement on moving ahead on COVID– 
19 legislation. Therefore, Members are 
advised that no additional votes are ex-
pected in the House this week after we 
complete the next two votes. 
Members are further advised, Madam 
Speaker, that as conversations sur-
rounding additional coronavirus relief 
legislation continues, it is expected 
that the House will meet during the 
month of August. 
I have told my Members, and I have 
told the minority leader and whip, that 
no one should schedule themselves for 
next week or until such time as we 
adopt COVID–19 legislation. 
Members will be given at least 24 
hours’ notice before the House will be 
called back into session. 
We will not start the August district 
work period until we pass appropriate 
COVID–19 relief to meet the current 
health and economic crisis confronting 
our people and our country. 
Further information will be provided 
as soon as it becomes available. 
And, Madam Speaker, at the end of 
the day, I will make further observa-
tions with reference to where we stand, 
but Members are advised that this is 
the schedule. It obviously is designed 
to ensure that we act as quickly as hu-
manly and legislatively possible to 
give the relief the country needs. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
KELLY of Illinois). The previous ques-
tion is ordered on the bill, as amended. 
The question is on engrossment and 
third reading of the bill, as amended. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I 
am in its current form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Aderholt moves to recommit the bill 
H.R. 7617 to the Committee on Appropria-
tions with instructions to report the same 
back to the House forthwith with the fol-
lowing amendment: 
Page 223, line 18, after the dollar amount, 
insert ‘‘(increased by $15,000,000)’’. 
Page 235, line 8, after the dollar amount, 
insert ‘‘(reduced by $15,000,000)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Alabama is recognized for 5 minutes in 
support of his motion. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, 
my motion this morning moves $15 mil-
lion from an unauthorized program 
that provides free legal assistance to il-
legal immigrants at the southern bor-
der to the Byrne Justice Assistance 
Grant program. 
The Byrne Justice Assistance Grant 
program—or Byrne JAG, as it is com-
monly known—is a leading source of 
law enforcement assistance funding to 
State, local, and Tribal jurisdictions 
across the United States. 
Its namesake was Edward Byrne. He 
was a New York City police officer. He 
was known by Eddie to his family and 
his friends. He was outgoing. He was a 
friendly individual who wanted to 
make his city a safer place. 
In 1987, Officer Byrne joined the New 
York City Police Department. He was 
well liked by his fellow officers, and he 
was passionate about his work. 
However, in the early morning hours 
of February 26, 1988, Officer Byrne was 
on detail protecting a witness who had 
testified against local drug dealers. Of-
ficer Byrne was in his patrol car out-
side the witness’ home when armed 
gunmen crept up to his car and shot 
him five times in the head. He died of 
his injuries. 
The NYPD lost one of its finest that 
day, and Eddie’s family lost a cher-
ished son and a brother. He was only 
age 22. 
In honor of Officer Byrne, Congress 
subsequently 
created 
the 
Edward 
Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance 
Grant program. In 2019 alone, Byrne 
JAG assisted nearly 1,000 State, local, 
and Tribal jurisdictions. 
Many Members of this body know 
that Byrne JAG provides critical fund-
ing, but Byrne JAG does a lot more. 
The program that memorializes Eddie 
Byrne also supports indigent defense 
programs, drug treatment programs, 
and mental health programs. 
In our Nation, the fair administra-
tion of justice demands that competent 
and effective public defenders are a 
part of our system. Our annual Byrne 
JAG appropriations help to uphold just 
that. 
As I noted, the Byrne JAG grants 
also support drug treatment programs. 
Research shows that drug treatment is 
more effective than imprisonment at 
reducing drug use and related crime. 
In addition, Byrne JAG supports cri-
sis intervention initiatives. 
Sadly, the lack of mental health 
services across the United States often 
results in police officers serving as the 
first responders in the case of a mental 
health crisis. 
b 1045 
However, crisis intervention teams 
that are supported by Byrne JAG re-
duce arrests of people with mental ill-
ness while improving the likelihood 
that individuals will receive that men-
tal health treatment they need. 
I think Officer Byrne would be 
pleased with this. These are just a few 
of the reasons to support this motion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4199 
July 31, 2020 
If you need more, please consider this: 
Current immigration law affirms an il-
legal immigrant’s right to counsel at 
no expense to taxpayers. 
Moreover, under this bill, even illegal 
immigrants who are ineligible for asy-
lum, such as criminals and those who 
have had their asylum applications de-
nied, could benefit from taxpayer-fund-
ed lawyers. 
And despite what you may hear from 
the other side of the aisle, having a 
lawyer won’t automatically improve 
someone’s likelihood of being granted 
asylum. It doesn’t change the facts. 
Madam Speaker, our immigration 
laws are clear, and they prohibit tax-
payer funds from being used to provide 
lawyers for those who are here ille-
gally. 
Furthermore, this annual appropria-
tions bill is no place to debate or over-
turn immigration law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this motion. It rejects the calls of 
any defunding of any police programs, 
and it increases the support for the 
many vital and compassionate mis-
sions of State and local law enforce-
ment officers who, like Eddie Byrne, 
are dedicating their lives to bettering 
their communities across the United 
States of America. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the mo-
tion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the Republican mo-
tion to recommit turns a deaf ear to 
the vast majority of Americans who be-
lieve the time is now for police reform. 
This summer, we have found our-
selves in a moment of national anguish 
over the lives that we have lost to po-
lice brutality and the injustice that we 
see each and every day because of sys-
temic racism. 
To meet the challenges of this mo-
ment and to live up to our highest 
ideals, we must have the strength and 
the vision to act boldly. 
In the hot summers of the 1960s, this 
House acted on transformative legisla-
tion, which outlawed legal discrimina-
tion and expanded the right to vote. 
Today, we are called to take bold, 
transformative action to fundamen-
tally change law enforcement in Amer-
ica by ending racial profiling, elimi-
nating police brutality, and ensuring 
accountability and transparency and 
accuracy in our policing. 
That is why I was so proud to join my 
colleagues in passing the bipartisan 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act 
just over a month ago. 
Unfortunately, that bill languishes in 
Senator 
MCCONNELL’s 
legislative 
graveyard. But we cannot wait for Re-
publicans to heed the voices of the left 
out and the left behind. If we did, we 
might be stuck waiting until hell 
freezes over. That is why House Demo-
crats are using the appropriations 
process to build safer and stronger 
communities for every American. That 
is every American. 
This bill provides strong Federal sup-
port for State and local law enforce-
ment, but it conditions those funds on 
commonsense reforms such as banning 
choke 
holds 
and 
curbing 
racial 
profiling. 
Unfortunately, in this MTR, the Re-
publicans who oppose those reforms, 
they are really turning to their favor-
ite tactic, and that is scapegoating im-
migrants. 
Let me be clear. Turning away asy-
lum seekers turns our backs on our Na-
tion’s highest ideals. This MTR cuts 
$15 million in the bill that would help 
ensure asylum seekers arriving at our 
borders receive legal assistance. 
This funding will protect the rights 
and the dignity of these vulnerable 
people, and it will help speed up the 
backlog of claims that has led to squal-
id conditions that no human being— 
and I mean no human being—should be 
forced to endure. 
This week, we buried our colleague 
and friend, the Honorable, the Honor-
able Congressman John Lewis. John 
often spoke of the vision he shared 
with Martin Luther King, Jr., of our 
human family living as a beloved com-
munity. And, yes, we have a long way 
to go to live up to that ideal, but the 
thoughtful use of Federal funds in this 
bill brings us closer to that goal. 
This MTR, mind you, yes, it takes us 
back, attacking civil rights reforms, 
which our beloved Congressman John 
Lewis fought all of his life for. It de-
means those who are coming into our 
Nation in search of a better life. 
It is outrageous. I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no’’ on the motion to recom-
mit, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 197, nays 
219, not voting 14, as follows:

July 31, 2020 
MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEM-
BRANCE 
OF 
THE 
OVER 
150,000 
AMERICANS WHO HAVE PASSED 
AWAY 
FROM 
THE 
COVID–19 
VIRUS 
The SPEAKER. The Chair asks all 
Members in the Chamber, as well as 
Members and staff throughout the Cap-
itol, to rise for a moment of silence in 
remembrance of the over 150,000 Ameri-
cans who have passed away from the 
COVID–19 virus. 
f 
AUTHORIZING 
THE 
CLERK 
TO 
MAKE 
CORRECTIONS 
IN 
EN-
GROSSMENT OF H.R. 7617, DE-
PARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPRO-
PRIATIONS ACT, 2021 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that in the engross-
ment of the bill, H.R. 7617, the Clerk be 
authorized to make technical correc-
tions and conforming changes to the 
bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentlewoman from New 
York? 
There was no objection. 
f 
ADDRESSING THE CRISIS OF 
SYSTEMIC RACISM 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, last week, 
I shared with the House that my office 
has launched a website where Ameri-
cans could learn about the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act, weigh in 
with their opinion on the bill, and list 
themselves as citizen cosponsors if 
they support it. 
Thousands of Americans, Mr. Speak-
er, have become citizen cosponsors. 
Many have also shared their own sto-
ries and called for Senate action on 
this bill. 
Sadly, Senate Republicans refuse to 
do anything to address the crisis of 
systemic racism in our country. More 
than a month has passed, and they 
have taken no action—nor on their own 
bills—on the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act. That is an irresponsible 
abdication of its duty to address the 
challenges facing our country. 
Today, Mr. Speaker, I will begin sub-
mitting the names of more than 7,000 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act 
citizen cosponsors in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD. There are so many of 
those, it may take several days. 
As 
more 
add 
their 
names 
at 
justiceinpolicing.us, we will continue 
to submit them into the RECORD, be-
cause the Senate needs to see how im-
portant this issue is to so many of our 
fellow Americans. They need to see 
how many of our people are urging 
them to act. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a list of citizen cosponsors to the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. 
Steve Dwyer, Washington, DC; Annaliese 
Davis, Washington, DC; Henry Snurr, West-
minster, MD; Shaun Brown, Laguna Beach, 
CA; Mariel Saez, Arlington, VA; Marco 
Konopacki, Syracuse, NY; Megan Capiak,

Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I also want 
to urge the Senate to stop ignoring 
this issue and listen to the voices of 
thousands who have taken the time to 
add their names here and share their 
stories. We must take action to make 
it clear that Black lives matter. 
Mr. Speaker, we passed a bill just a 
few days ago to remove the statues of 
Roger Brooke Taney and other people. 
In the opinion, the Dred Scott decision, 
what Roger Brooke Taney of the State 
of Maryland said was Black lives do 
not matter. They are not citizens. 
They are not worthy, he pointed out, to 
be with those of us who are White. 
We need to make sure that those citi-
zens of our country understand that, 
yes, Black lives matter. 
Mr. Speaker, I also have the sad obli-
gation to say that yesterday, Mr. 
Donnald Anderson passed away. He was 
a page at the age of 13 on this floor. We 
don’t have pages anymore, but it was a 
wonderful experience for those young 
people. 
He stayed. He stayed in the Cloak-
room. He became the director of the 
Cloakroom, and then he became the 
Clerk of the House. 
He had a distinguished career serving 
in this institution, which he loved. It 
began as a teenager, as I said. 
When I came to the House, he was 
the assistant manager of the Demo-
cratic Cloakroom. He served as Clerk 
of the House for the 100th through the 
103rd Congresses. 
Donn was also a U.S. Army Reservist. 
His life was filled with service to his 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope all of the Mem-
bers of this House will join me in ex-
pressing gratitude for his life and serv-
ice and condolences to Donn’s family. I 
will be taking time when we return. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to announce our 
schedule. I did it before when not ev-
erybody was on the floor, but hopefully 
most. We are sending it out. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a 
moment to thank the House for their 
hard work and perseverance as we en-
gaged in one of the most productive pe-
riods in the modern history of the 
House. 
In 20 days, 4 weeks—11⁄2 weeks in 
June, 21⁄2 weeks in July—the number of 
major bills we passed in June and July 
is literally staggering. 
We passed the George Floyd Justice 
in Policing Act. We passed the Defense 
authorization bill. We passed D.C. 
statehood. We passed legislation to 
strengthen and expand the Affordable 
Care Act; a bill to protect renters and 
mortgage holders; a No Ban to reverse 
the Muslim ban, which was incon-
sistent with America’s Constitution 
and principles; and we provided for ac-
cess to counsel. 
We passed the Great American Out-
doors Act in a bipartisan fashion; a 
major, major infrastructure bill; Water 
Resources Development Act; a bill to 
remove Confederate statues, which I 
have already talked about; childcare 
bills, two major childcare bills; 10—lis-
ten to me—10 appropriations bills. 
The Senate has not passed a single 
appropriations bill, not one. 
When we came here to the last Con-
gress, to this Congress, the government 
was shut down. Why? Because the ma-
jority party had not passed the funding 
of government. 
None of you, in my view, nor I, have 
served in a 20-day period where so 
much consequential legislation was 
passed. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, much of 
that legislation is now and may well be 
sitting in the Senate for some period of 
time. 
This came, Mr. Speaker, after we 
passed the HEROES Act 80-some days 
ago. 
We now, Mr. Speaker, face a crisis, 
our people face a crisis, our country 
faces a crisis, because for 80 days that 
legislation sat untended in the United 
States Senate, and the relief that the 
American 
people 
needed 
then 
and 
now—and now has become a crisis— 
were not tended to by the United 
States Senate. 
The leader of the United States Sen-
ate said: Let the States go bankrupt. 
Thankfully, the leader of this party 
said: Let’s wait and see what happens. 
Well, we have seen what happened. I 
hope everybody, lamentably, saw the 
front page of The Washington Post: the 
deepest decline in the GDP, even be-
yond the Great Depression—think of 
that—because we twiddled our thumbs. 
On May 15, we passed an act to react 
robustly and effectively in meeting the 
crisis caused by this pandemic. How 
sad that the Senate, if it didn’t agree 
with our bill, didn’t send us another 
bill. But they did nothing, and now we 
see an economy at extraordinary risk 
and individuals and families and chil-
dren and those who are hungry. 
We included food assistance in the 
bill that we passed in the HEROES Act. 
We included legislation to make sure 
that we could go back to school safely 
and the schools would have the re-
sources to make that happen. We in-
cluded additional medical assistance 
for this onslaught that our hospitals 
are confronted with. That is in the HE-
ROES Act. 
But what do our Republican friends 
offer us? 
By the way, I don’t know that our 
Republican friends offered us anything, 
Mr. MCCONNELL, because they can’t 
agree in the Senate. As Senator GRA-
HAM said, they are deeply divided. 
Indeed, Mr. Speaker, they are a deep-
ly divided and dysfunctional party, be-
cause they cannot come up with an al-
ternative. 
Meanwhile, other than the defense 
authorization bill—that is the only bill 
they passed—the Senate did not pass a 
single piece of major legislation during 
that same period, 80 days. 
We have passed major legislation 
over and over and over again, and we 
did it in 20 days. 
So, Mr. Speaker, we are not announc-
ing the August work period. We will be 
ready to act as soon as we can on a 
COVID–19 relief act. We believe the HE-
ROES Act does that. 
The only thing that they propose, or 
come back with, is extending unem-
ployment and cutting it 66 percent so 
that an American family relying on 
that money is going to go cold turkey 
under their plan. 
Now, I have said we can discuss the 
level, but we cannot discuss it so that 
we say, 24 hours from now, they are on 
their own, Mr. and Mrs. America. 
b 1230 
So I have put everybody on notice on 
both sides of the aisle that I will call 
this House back into session. The 
Speaker will technically call it out, 
but I will recommend that the Speaker 
call this House back into session at the

very minute that we have an agree-
ment, that we know we can pass some-
thing through the United States Sen-
ate. We can pass it here. We have 
passed it. 
The people need the assistance we 
give them. The economy needs the as-
sistance. And I would think my Repub-
lican friends who see the economy in 
absolute free fall would be demanding 
that we get to an agreement, not just 
demanding you do this and only this. 
We are a democracy. The American 
people have elected us to be the leader-
ship in this House. And they have 
elected a lot of Democrats in the Sen-
ate and the Republicans to be in charge 
of the Senate. They expect us to come 
to an agreement. 
Do you know who said that, Mr. 
Speaker? Newt Gingrich, Newt Ging-
rich when he made a deal with Bill 
Clinton on the budget. The conserv-
atives in his party said: No, we are not 
going to make any deal. And Newt 
Gingrich’s reply was: Look, we are in a 
democracy, and we have to heed the 
views of both sides of the aisle. 
Newt Gingrich said that, and he was 
savaged by his conservatives who sim-
ply wanted to say no. 
The American people need a yes. The 
American people need help. Families 
need help. People who are not able to 
buy food need help, and hospitals that 
are stretched, and States and local gov-
ernments. 
I urge all of my Republican col-
leagues and Democratic colleagues to 
talk to your local mayor, your local 
county commissioner, your local city 
council person. They will tell you they 
are hemorrhaging revenues. Why? Be-
cause the economy has fallen so swift-
ly. 
They are on the front lines. They 
hire teachers. They hire sanitation 
workers. They hire police. They hire 
fire protection. They hire emergency 
medical response teams. They are on 
the front lines, all of those levels of 
government. 
We must come together, Mr. Speaker, 
and get to an agreement. If we do not, 
we will fail the American people. 
On May 15, we passed a bill, and for 80 
days, the Republican leadership did 
nothing. And now, they say: Take this 
or nothing. 
We are going to be on the side of the 
people, and we are going to get a bill 
that is for the people. At that point in 
time, I will immediately give 24 hours’ 
notice minimum so that people can get 
back here and do their duty. 
Mr. Speaker, last week, I shared with the 
House that my office had launched a website 
where Americans could learn about the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, weigh in 
with their opinion on the bill, and list them-
selves as a ‘‘citizen cosponsor’’ if they support 
it. Thousands of Americans have become ‘‘cit-
izen cosponsors.’’ 
Many have also shared their own stories 
and called for Senate action on this bill. 
Sadly, Senate Republicans refuse to do 
anything to address the crisis of systemic rac-
ism and police brutality. 
More than a month has passed, and they 
have taken no action on the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act. 
That’s an irresponsible abdication of its duty 
to address the challenges facing our country. 
Today, I will begin submitting the names of 
the more than 7,000 ‘‘citizen cosponsors’’ of 
the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act into 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
There are so many, that it may take several 
days to do so. And as more add their names 
at justiceinpolicing.us, we will continue to sub-
mit them into the RECORD. 
Because the Senate needs to see how im-
portant this issue is to so many of our fellow 
Americans. 
They need to see how many of our people 
are urging them to act. 
So, Madam Speaker, include in the RECORD 
this list of ‘‘citizen cosponsors.’’ And I ask that 
the Senate stop ignoring this issue and listen 
to the voices of thousands who have taken the 
time to add their names here and share their 
stories. 
We must take action to make it clear that 
Black Lives Matter. 
In addition, I want to share the sad news 
that former Clerk of the House Donnald An-
derson passed away yesterday. 
He had a distinguished career serving this 
institution, which he loved. 
It began as a teenager, when Donn served 
as a House page. 
When I came to the House, he was the as-
sistant manager of the Democratic cloakroom. 
He then served as the Clerk for the 100th 
through 103rd Congresses. 
Donn was also a U.S. Army reservist. His 
life was filled with service to his country. 
I hope all of the members of this House will 
join me in expressing gratitude for his life and 
service and condolences to Donn’s family. 
I would like to take a moment to thank the 
members of this House for their hard work and 
perseverance as we engaged in one of the 
most productive periods in the modern history 
of the House. 
The number of major bills we passed in 
June and July is staggering: 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act; 
Defense authorization; 
D.C. statehood; 
Legislation to strengthen & expand the Af-
fordable Care Act; 
A bill to protect renters & homeowners from 
eviction; 
No ban & access to counsel; 
Great American Outdoors Act; 
A major infrastructure package; 
Water Resources Development Act; 
A bill to remove Confederate statues and 
other reminders of slavery from the Capitol; 
Child care bills; and 
Ten appropriations bills, funding the vast 
majority of the government ahead of the fiscal 
year. 
These came on the heels of May’s HE-
ROES Act, major relief to the American people 
during this present crisis. 
Meanwhile, other than the Defense author-
ization bill that the House sent over, the Sen-
ate did not pass a single piece of major legis-
lation during that same period. 
So, I want to thank you all for bearing with 
the very busy schedule so that we could make 
sure the people’s house continues to govern 
for the people. 
EL PASO COMMUNITY HEALING 
GARDEN 
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, Monday, 
August 3, will mark 1 year since El 
Paso, Texas, became the target of a 
killer who confessed to driving over 600 
miles in order to stop what he called 
the ‘‘Hispanic invasion’’ with his AK– 
47. 
In a horrific act of domestic ter-
rorism, he killed 23 people, injured 22, 
and devastated all of us. This wasn’t 
only another tragic outcome of Amer-
ica’s gun violence epidemic, but also a 
result of America’s hate epidemic 
fueled by racism and xenophobia as 
well as rhetoric coming from the most 
powerful leaders in the land. 
One year later, we still don’t have 
laws that make us safer from gun vio-
lence, and we still face a reckoning on 
hate. 
My community continues to confront 
hate with love and to honor the vic-
tims and survivors. In that spirit, it is 
my privilege today to introduce legis-
lation that honors the victims of the 
August 3, 2019, attack and designates 
the El Paso Community Healing Gar-
den as a national memorial.

MARKING 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
STRENGTHENING 
CAREER 
AND 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION FOR THE 
21ST CENTURY ACT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, I had the 
pleasure of standing in the Oval Office 
with President Trump as he signed my 
bill, the Strengthening Career and 
Technical Education for the 21st Cen-
tury Act into law. 
I was proud to see this bill become 
law, but I was even more proud to see 
it pass with such overwhelming bipar-
tisan support. Not a single Member of 
Congress in either Chamber voted 
against it. 
The Strengthening Career and Tech-
nical Education for the 21st Century 
Act is the first major overhaul to the 
Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical 
Education Act since 2006. 
COVID–19 has underscored just how 
much the Nation depends on a skilled 
and trained workforce. That is why I 
am pleased to cosponsor the Skills Re-
newal Act. This legislation will support 
individuals who have become unem-
ployed as a result of the pandemic with 
a $4,000 skills training credit and will 
support career and technical education 
opportunities such as apprenticeships 
and certificate programs. 
Career and technical education in-
vests in America’s most valuable re-
source, our people, and provides the 
tools necessary to pursue high-skill, 
high-wage, family-sustaining careers.

July 31, 2020 
PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
AGGRESSION 
(Mr. PALLONE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
condemn action taken by the People’s 
Republic of China, or PRC, in the 
Ladakh region of India that led to 
deadly clashes between the two coun-
tries on June 15. 
Since the truce in 1962, the PRC and 
India have been divided by a 2,100-mile- 
long Line of Actual Control. In the 
months leading up to this clash, the 
PRC 
military 
reportedly 
amassed 
about 5,000 soldiers along this bound-
ary, and that clearly meant to redraw 
longstanding settled borders by force 
and aggression. 
A skirmish, unsurprisingly, broke 
out on June 15 as a direct result of 
these troop movements, leaving at 
least 
20 
Indian 
soldiers 
and 
an 
unconfirmed number of Chinese sol-
diers dead. 
This intentional encroachment and 
escalatory tactics used by the PRC are 
consistent with other provocative ac-
tions its forces have taken throughout 
South and Southeast Asia. To counter 
this aggression, I am glad that the 
House of Representatives passed an 
amendment that I cosponsored with 
Congressman 
KRISHNAMOORTHI
that 
calls on China to cease its military ag-
gression and urges immediate diplo-
matic action to prevent any further es-
calation of conflict. 
I will continue to work with my col-
leagues here in Congress to find ways 
to help bolster our vital relationship 
with India.

THANKING 141ST AIR REFUELING 
WING 
(Mrs. RODGERS of Washington asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to honor Washington 
State’s 141st Air Refueling Wing at 
Fairchild Air Force Base. In countless 
ways, the 141st Air Refueling Wing has 
answered the call of service. 
Because of the COVID–19 crisis, they 
have also taken action to help families 
in need. For example, they have helped 
food banks distribute more than 4.5 
million pounds of food. They have 
partnered with the Washington State 
Department of Health Incident Man-
agement Team on testing sites. At this 
very moment, airmen and -women are 
operating five mobile testing facilities 
in my State. 
On top of all this, the 141st Air Re-
fueling Wing is also fighting fires. As 
the summer wildfire season ends, Team 
Fairchild’s RC–26 Metroliner has flown 
hundreds of hours, detecting 110 new 
fires and mapping more than 325 fires. 
With this critical data, the 141st Air 
Refueling Wing has saved lives, prop-
erty, and businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, the 141st Air Refueling 
Wing and Washington State National 
Guard serve both at home and around 
the world. I thank them for their life-
saving efforts and sacrifices.

SOLVING 
THE

TION’S 
PROBLEMS 
WITH 
CUT-
TING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY 
(Mr. SOTO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the appropriations pack-
age we just passed today. 
Central Florida is space and tech-
nology country. We just launched the 
Perseverance rover yesterday, which 
we could see from my backyard. We are 
the busiest spaceport in the world at 
Cape Canaveral. 
I was honored to help boost funds and 
recognize the important global com-
petition and for America to be a leader 
in low-Earth orbit and commercial 
spaceflight operations. 
We advanced Outer Planet and Ocean 
Worlds, including the Europa Clipper 
mission to advance humankind. We 
also fought for more funding for emerg-
ing technology like solar energy, arti-
ficial 
intelligence, 
to 
improve 
blockchain, and for quantum com-
puting investments. 
Why is this important? We use quan-
tum computing to identify 12 separate 
antiviral drugs, one of which ended up 
being remdesivir, through quantum 
computing and artificial intelligence 
here in the Federal Government. 
We can solve the next generation’s 
problems 
with 
cutting-edge 
tech-
nology. We will continue to do that 
going forward.

CONGRATULATING DR. JOSE ARCE 
(Mr. YOHO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Dr. Jose Arce. He is 
poised to make history for being the 
first person from Puerto Rico to be 
elected to the post of the American 
Veterinary 
Medical 
Association 
as 
president. 
Dr. Arce was born and raised in Puer-
to Rico. He is a 1997 graduate of the 
LSU School of Veterinary Medicine. 
Dr. Arce returned to Puerto Rico and 
now is president and co-owner of 
Miramar Animal Hospital in San Juan, 
where he practices with his wife, Dr. 
Anik Puig, who also is a veterinarian. 
Jose has been an active member in 
the field of veterinary medicine, hold-
ing many positions in its leadership, 
from adviser to the board of directors 
of the American Veterinary Medical 
Foundation. 
The AVMA is fortunate to have such 
a passionate advocate representative of 
the profession. His election to the 
president of the AVMA will inspire peo-
ple from all backgrounds and heritage 
and show that if you are willing to 
dream and dream big, and you are will-
ing to work, those dreams come true. 
That, and he, are the essence of the 
American Dream. 
f 
KLAMATH BASIN 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, lying in 
northern California and southern Or-
egon is the Klamath Lake as well as 
the Klamath Project, which has pro-
vided water for agriculture for almost 
100 years. 
The science involved that informs 
how much water the Klamath Project 
receives each year has been flawed for 
quite some time. For years, farmers 
and ranchers in the Klamath Basin 
have 
competed 
with 
salmon 
and 
suckerfish for the full water allocation 
that they need. This year’s battle was 
the final straw. 
Earlier this month, in July, Sec-
retary Bernhardt and Commissioner 
Burman came to visit the Klamath 
Basin to meet with farmers, ranchers, 
locals, and other stakeholders at the 
invitation of myself and my colleague, 
GREG WALDEN. They got to see just 
how harmful the bad science has been 
to the irrigators in the basin. 
This week, the Secretary and Com-
missioner announced that the Trump 
administration is making a commit-
ment to update the science on the 
Klamath Project, and it will inevitably 
provide relief to the irrigators and the 
dwindling fish populations that have 
suffered nonsensical allocations. 
In a time where it seems that our 
government can’t seem to get much 
right or much production done, this ad-
ministration has provided a potentially 
lifesaving solution to the Klamath 
Basin in just under a month. 
Updating the science is critical and 
will help us make more informed deci-
sions for decades to come.

MOVE QUICKLY TO VOTE ON 
STIMULUS PACKAGE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, for 
14 years, the Texas Department of 
Transportation has been attempting to 
build I–45, which would literally de-
stroy large aspects of my community. 
In this past appropriation, I am de-
lighted to have had amendments that 
have indicated that you cannot use 106 
funds without looking closely at the 
historic preservation impact. 
I provided $1 million extra to help 
impoverished 
communities 
fight 
against such construction that re-
moves buildings like homes, busi-
nesses, 
and 
culturally 
significant 
structures. That is what is happening

churches, buildings, homes, and con-
dominiums are all being lost. 
We have to realize that people con-
trol this Nation and not governmental 
institutions that would do harm when 
people can lose their homes, their 
churches, and their businesses. 
Finally, I am glad that as we move 
into the negotiation of the HEROES 
Act, we will not have the liability 
issue. We cannot have the liability 
issue; block the $600 that people are 
supposed to have; the testing that peo-
ple are supposed to have; hospital com-
pensation. 
We need to move quickly to vote on 
this HEROES Act because our people in 
Houston, Texas, and across the Nation 
are suffering from COVID–19, and I will 
continue to fight so they can continue 
to survive and live. 
Tomorrow, we open another testing 
site in Houston, Texas.

HONORING HOLLY BARSTOW AND 
PATRICIA LONGACRE 
(Mr. BACON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor two dedicated residents 
from 
our 
district 
of 
Omaha 
who 
stepped up to the challenge COVID–19 
has placed on our communities. 
Holly Barstow and Patricia Longacre 
started a mask-making movement that 
accomplished an incredible feat. Since 
March, they and over 2,400 volunteers 
stayed busy as they worked to make 
over 140,000 masks. 
Holly and Patricia’s efforts started 
as a project to make 10,000 masks for 
local hospital personnel and first re-
sponders but quickly grew. In addition 
to the 140,000 masks, they also pro-
duced over 36,000 surgical caps, 200 sur-
gical gowns, 500 face shields, and thou-
sands of ear savers. 
They are now retiring, as commercial 
masks are readily available. 
I admire and thank Holly and Patri-
cia for serving others. They have in-
spired many to be servant leaders. 
They have also demonstrated the inno-
vative and can-do spirit that makes 
America great. We admire them.

STAUNTON KIWANIS CLUB 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
commend the Staunton Kiwanis Club 
for their efforts to donate food and sup-
plies to local families in need. 
Originally, the club had donated sup-
plies for the Little League Baseball 
opener, but when the season was 
abruptly canceled, club member Mi-
chael Roman urged his group to live 
their motto ‘‘to serve the kids’’ in a 
new way. 
Kiwanis members and Martin’s Food 
then arranged for the repurposing of 
donated items from the local store. 
Kiwanis members now pick up items 
and drive to the concession stand in 
Gypsy Hill Park, where supplies are 
sorted and redistributed to social serv-
ice agencies to be used by their clients. 
Since April, 15 loads of food, averaging 
450 pounds each, have been donated, 
providing about 334 meals per load. 
Quick thinking and dedicated action 
by Staunton Kiwanis turned the dis-
appointment of a lost baseball season 
into positive assistance for local fami-
lies to truly serve the kids.

BIRTHDAY OF LIDIA TUBIELLO 
(Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the recent 100th 
birthday of longtime Bucks County, 
Pennsylvania, resident, Lidia Tubiello. 
A resident of Nockamixon, Lidia has 
consistently been a role model, show-
ing all of us that hard work and serving 
others is the calling that we all have. 
A bona fide Rosie the Riveter, Lidia 
answered the call during World War II 
and began work as a welder in western 
Pennsylvania, where she helped assem-
ble transport vessels. The ships that 
Lidia worked on played a critical role 
in the invasion of Normandy. 
Lidia’s husband, Frank, was drafted 
to the United States Army. Once the 
war was over, Lidia and Frank set up 
their permanent residence in Bucks 
County, Pennsylvania. The couple wel-
comed seven loving children: Frank, 
Ralph, Sam, Paul, Laurie, Lisette, and 
Loretta. 
As their children grew and they had 
their own families, the large Italian- 
American family came together for 
traditional Italian meals during fre-
quent Sunday dinners. 
Mr. Speaker, we are all extremely 
fortunate to have Lidia in our commu-
nity. Her hard work and service are 
something that we should honor.

RECOGNIZING DUSTIN NIST OF 
NEW FRANKLIN, OHIO 
(Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, today I rise to recognize the heroic 
efforts of Dustin Nist from New Frank-
lin, Ohio. 
On June 11, 2020, Dustin witnessed a 
car run a stop sign, drive off the road, 
and descend into the Tuscarawas River. 
Without hesitating, Dustin ran to help. 
Seeing the car had been partially 
submerged, Dustin ran to the nearby 
fire station to alert the rescue crew 
and then ran back to the scene of the 
accident. Dustin made his way down a 
hill into the water, swimming to the 
passenger side of the vehicle in order to 
break out the window. Unsure about 
the passenger’s injuries, Dustin was 
hesitant about removing the woman 
from the car but stayed with her until 
the rescue crews arrived. 
Unfortunately, the driver of the vehi-
cle, Franklin D. Roffe, succumbed to 
his injuries; but due to Dustin’s heroic 
efforts and the work of the New Frank-
lin Police and Fire Departments, Clin-
ton Fire Department, Ohio State High-
way Patrol, and the staff of Summa 
Akron City Hospital, the woman’s life 
was saved. 
Today, we honor Kent State Univer-
sity student and New Franklin resident 
Dustin Nist for his heroic actions and 
keep everyone involved in this tragic 
accident in our prayers.

PAY FOR SLAY MUST END 
(Mr. LAMBORN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, in 
March 2016, Taylor Force, a U.S. Army 
veteran, was brutally murdered by a 
Palestinian terrorist while visiting 
Israel. The terrorist’s family now re-
ceives monthly rewards from the so- 
called Palestinian Authority Martyrs 
Fund. Palestinian leadership has spent 
over $350 million rewarding tens of 
thousands of terrorists with pay-for- 
slay payments. 
My bill, the Taylor Force Act, signed 
into law by President Trump in 2018, 
targeted these payments, but we have 
documented evidence that they con-
tinue today. 
The U.S. must sanction Palestinian 
officials, like Qadri Abu Bakr, who are 
incentivizing terror and officially des-
ignate them as sponsors of terror. We 
must let the enemies of peace know 
that the United States will not stand 
by and allow the Palestinian Authority 
to promote and reward the murder of 
innocents through pay for slay. 
Mr. Speaker, in March 2016, Taylor Force, 
an American citizen and U.S. Army veteran 
who served his country in both Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, was brutally and senselessly mur-
dered by a Palestinian terrorist while visiting 
Israel. The murderer was later shot dead by 
police after his stabbing spree wounded an-
other 10 innocent victims. 
For carrying out this evil act, the terrorist’s 
family receives monthly stipends from the so- 
called ‘‘Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund.’’ 
In fact, tens of thousands of terrorists and 
their families have received millions of dollars 
from Palestinian leadership as a reward for 
murdering innocent men, women, and chil-
dren. 
The grotesque incentive is structured so that 
the more people they kill, the greater their 
monetary reward. The most prolific killers can 
receive more than $3,500 a month. This in-
cludes those who were and remain members 
of designated terrorist organizations as de-
scribed in President Trump’s Terrorist Des-
ignation Executive Order #13224. 
Palestinian leadership has since spent over 
$350 million rewarding these heinous acts of 
terror in what has now been universally 
dubbed ‘‘pay-for-slay.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4207 
July 31, 2020 
My bill, the Taylor Force Act, was signed 
into law by President Trump on March 23, 
2018. This law was meant to disincentivize 
these awful payments, end the senseless war 
of terror against Israel, and advance the cause 
of peace by ending the cycle of violence per-
petuated by the Palestinian political leader-
ship. 
Unfortunately, Palestinian Authority leaders 
have publicly rejected the terms of the Taylor 
Force Act. We have seen documented evi-
dence that the ‘‘pay for slay’’ payments are 
now continuing in 2020, something which Pal-
estinian leadership has brazenly praised with-
out fear of consequences from the United 
States. 
The appropriate next step is to personally 
sanction the Palestinian officials involved in 
this incentivizing of terror. 
The Palestinian Commission of Prisoners’ 
Affairs and its Director, Qadri Abu Bakr, must 
be designated as sponsors of terror, as the 
administration committed itself to in Executive 
Order 13224. 
President Trump’s Peace to Prosperity plan 
for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict spe-
cifically addresses the ‘Prisoner and Martyr 
Payments’ and calls for their immediate termi-
nation. This position has received long-stand-
ing bipartisan support at home and abroad. 
It is time we let the enemies of peace know 
in no uncertain terms that the United States 
will not stand idly by and allow the Palestinian 
Authority to promote and pay for the murder of 
innocents through pay-for-slay.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LEVIN
of Michigan). The Chair an-
nounces that the Speaker’s announced 
policy of April 7, 2020, will remain in ef-
fect during the pendency of a covered 
period pursuant to House Resolution 
965. 
f 
AND STILL I RISE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Mr. Speaker. 
It is my honor to stand here in the 
House of Representatives. It is my 
honor to be a Member of this Congress, 
and I am grateful to the many persons 
who made great sacrifices so that I 
would have this opportunity. 
Today I would like to use this oppor-
tunity to make an appeal to my col-
leagues, to my friends, and to people 
who are within the sound of my voice. 
I want to make an appeal to persons to 
please take the coronavirus seriously. I 
ask that you take it seriously because 
it is not a joke. It is not a laughing 
matter. People are dying. We have had 
over 150,000 deaths in this country. It is 
not a laughing matter. We have had 
over 4 million cases in this country. It 
is not a hoax. It is real. 
I am asking my friends, my col-
leagues, and those who are within the 
sound of my voice, please, let’s do what 
we can to protect ourselves and others. 
I beg that we would please wear the 
face mask. Let us wash our hands. Let 
us maintain the distancing. 
I know that it won’t happen all of the 
time. We can have a memory lapse. We 
might just rush out of the house and 
not have our mask on. But let’s not, 
with intentionality, leave home with-
out it. Let’s not, with intentionality, 
mix and mingle with the persons 
around us without a mask on. Let us, 
with intentionality, do all that we can 
to protect ourselves and others. 
This virus is not relenting at this 
time. It is relentless. Hospital ICU beds 
in many places in hot spots around the 
country are at capacity. 
We see evidence that this virus is 
going to continue for a while longer. I 
don’t know how long. I am not sure 
anybody does. But I do know that we 
ought not take it lightly, that we 
ought not allow persons who are within 
our space, our personal space, if you 
will, to catch it from us. I don’t want 
to give it to someone, and I would trust 
that no one would want to give it to 
me. 
So let’s be sensible. Let’s be respon-
sible. Let’s honor the protocols that we 
have set here in the House of Rep-
resentatives. Let’s honor the protocols 
to social distance. 
I know it is difficult. I won’t pretend 
that I keep the social distancing as 
properly as I should. I understand. I 
make mistakes. But I don’t do it inten-
tionally. I am not going to inten-
tionally take off my mask and commu-
nicate with persons. 
I am not going to try in any way to 
demonstrate that somehow I am invul-
nerable, I am invincible, this is a joke, 
this is a hoax, and that we need not try 
to protect ourselves from this virus. I 
am not going to do it, and I am going 
to ask that others would not do it. 
Let’s love each other and protect 
each other. This is a matter of life and 
death. 
Finally, on this topic of the virus, we 
have had some persons who contract 
the virus who are associated with the 
House. I want you to know, Mr. Speak-
er, that I care about them. I pray for 
them. And I want you to know that I 
am asking that we all make sure that 
this doesn’t become a means by which 
we distance ourselves from other peo-
ple simply because they have had the 
virus. 
My hope is that persons who contract 
it will heal and they will be back at 
work and we will treat them with the 
same love and respect that we have al-
ways treated them, show them that 
they are welcome back to the House of 
Representatives. 
This 
is 
something 
that we can do to show each other how 
much we appreciate the persons who 
have survived this virus. 
I hope that every person who con-
tracts it will survive it. I don’t want to 
see anybody lose life or become chron-
ically injured in some way because of 
this virus. It ought not be that way, 
and my hope is that we won’t allow it 
to happen in the sense that people will 
contract it and we will find ourselves 
distancing ourselves from them. 
As I am about to leave now, I want to 
mention one additional item that is 
important. I am still concerned about 
invidious discrimination, and I am con-
cerned that we are reaching a plateau 
now as it relates to the movement that 
had as a part of its genesis the death of 
George Floyd. 
I am concerned that I don’t see the 
movement continuing with the amount 
of momentum that it richly and justly 
deserves. I am concerned that we are 
slowly getting back to bigotry as 
usual, we are slowly getting back to a 
point where we will do more talking 
about bigotry and discrimination than 
acting on the elimination of bigotry 
and discrimination. 
It really is a major issue in the coun-
try, and we should not allow ourselves 
to slip back into making it more about 
what we think ought to happen than 
doing what we can do to prevent this 
sort of discrimination from continuing 
to happen. 
So I am concerned, and because I am 
concerned, when we return, I hope to 
take some measures, some steps, if you 
will, to help us to remember that it 
doesn’t just go away because we don’t 
have a front-page issue. The front-page 
issues heighten our awareness, but it is 
still there after it is no longer on the 
front page, this invidious discrimina-
tion, this homophobia, Islamophobia, 
and xenophobia, all of the various pho-
bias that harm people—that other peo-
ple produce to harm people, I might 
add. So I am concerned, and I refuse to 
allow this issue to simply become an-
other incident and we get back to big-
otry as usual. 
At some point, we do need a depart-
ment of reconciliation in this country 
so that people can depend on our gov-
ernment doing all that it can to elimi-
nate discrimination and hate in the 
country. 
At some point, we need to have this 
department functioning at the highest 
level, with a secretary who reports to 
the President of the United States and 
that is funded properly so that we don’t 
find 
ourselves 
siloing 
each 
cir-
cumstance that involves invidious dis-
crimination and dealing with each one 
individually as opposed to dealing with 
all of this collectively. 
We have come a long way in this 
country, no question about it, but we 
dearly and truly have a long way that 
we have to go. What better way to get 
there than to say to the world that we 
are drawing this line, a bright line, and 
that we are going to have a department 
that is dedicated to the elimination of 
segregation to the extent that it ex-
ists—and it does exist in some places in 
our country—but also to eliminate this 
invidious discrimination wherever it 
exists in our country and against 
whomever it is perpetrated. 
Is it systemic? Yes, it is systemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4208 
July 31, 2020 
Just recently, a very prominent per-
son in our country, the Attorney Gen-
eral, had some problem acknowledging 
that systemic racism exists. It does. I 
have no problems acknowledging it, 
nor should anyone else, because the 
empirical evidence is there to support 
the fact that it exists. 
So my hope is that we won’t get back 
to bigotry as usual, and when we come 
back from this opportunity to work in 
our districts that we will take up 
issues associated with racism and in-
vidious discrimination here in the Con-
gress of the United States of America. 
This is where people expect us to act. 
And if we act, we can lead the Nation 
as opposed to reacting to what the Na-
tion is doing. It is time for us to take 
a lead and get rid of this scourge on 
our society. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

HONORING BUSINESSES AMID 
COVID–19 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. COMER) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the many individ-
uals, businesses, and manufacturers in 
the First Congressional District of 
Kentucky who have dedicated their 
time and efforts to helping our country 
fight COVID–19. 
Just months ago, there was a concern 
that America would face a drastic 
shortage of the medical supplies needed 
to fight the coronavirus. And while we 
may not be completely out of the 
woods, the efforts of so many caring 
citizens have been instrumental in pro-
viding needed supplies. 
I am proud to say that many of the 
citizens and companies who have as-
sisted in this fight call south central 
and western Kentucky home. Garment 
factories, like Stitches Apparel from 
my home county in Gamaliel, Ken-
tucky, WPT Nonwovens in Ohio Coun-
ty, Jomel Seams Reasonable in Cum-
berland and Russell Counties, and 
American Shield Apparel in Metcalfe 
County stepped up to manufacture face 
masks 
and 
gowns 
for 
frontline 
healthcare workers all across America. 
This is in addition to the countless 
citizens who have turned their kitchen 
tables into manufacturing centers for 
the face masks we have all become 
very familiar with. 
I am even more proud to say that 
some of our Nation’s heroes from Fort 
Campbell military base have gone into 
Boston and New York to provide med-
ical support when those areas were in 
desperate need of help. Like others, 
their contributions to our Nation will 
not be forgotten. 
Corn from Kentucky farmers has 
even been used to fight the spread with 
facilities like Commonwealth Agri-En-
ergy in Christian County providing 
base ethanol for distilleries to provide 
hand sanitizer. 
I also honor a young lady from my 
hometown who went above and beyond. 
Carrie Beth Cropper, a native Monroe 
Countian and a registered nurse, volun-
teered to go to New York City at the 
height of the outbreak to care for those 
in need. Her willingness to put her fel-
low Americans first to help fight back 
against the virus speaks volumes about 
her character. 
All of our nurses, hospitals, and other 
frontline workers have been heroic in 
working under extremely challenging 
conditions. Their country has never 
needed them more, and they have cer-
tainly met the moment. 
Unfortunately, 
our 
country 
con-
tinues to suffer from the outbreak of 
this virus. But in many ways, the pan-
demic has brought out the best of 
America: Neighbor helping neighbor 
and communities coming together to 
support one another. 
ORESTUS FLOWERS 100TH BIRTHDAY 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Orestus Flowers of 
the First Congressional District of 
Kentucky, who is turning 100 years old 
on September 7th. 
Mr. Flowers was born in Bow, Ken-
tucky, which is in Cumberland County, 
and continues to reside in the First 
Congressional District. Mr. Flowers 
served in the Army for 31⁄2 years and 
was stationed in the Philippines from 
1942 to 1945. I stand with all Americans 
to congratulate him on years of brav-
ery and sacrifice to preserve our safety 
and freedoms. 
On February 1, 1946, Mr. Flowers 
married Geraldine, and together they 
have three daughters. A true entre-
preneur, he was responsible for bring-
ing Houchens Markets to Burkesville 
in 1952 and served as manager for 32 
years. Upon retiring from Houchens, he 
worked at Norris and New Funeral 
Home for the next 25 years. 
I join with everyone in Burkesville 
and throughout the Commonwealth 
who has had the privilege of knowing 
him and to celebrate his fearless spirit. 
I am honored to represent Mr. Flowers 
and wish him a very happy 100th birth-
day. 
WANDA BLACKWELL RETIREMENT 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
congratulate 
Wanda 
Blackwell on her retirement from the 
Webster County Senior Center, where 
she has served as director for the last 4 
years. She is beloved by the seniors she 
cares for and their families because her 
devotion to serving others is evident in 
every effort she undertakes. 
Just a year ago, Webster County 
opened a new senior center that has al-
ready enriched the lives of so many and 
is evidence of the devotion Wanda and 
her team have for their fellow citizens. 
Whether she was serving or delivering 
meals, decorating and improving the 
center, or raising funds to expand their 
offerings and programming, she did it 
all with a smile on her face. Wanda 
lives by the saying, ‘‘grow where God 
planted you,’’ and has been a shining 
example of giving back to the local 
community. 
I join with Wanda’s family, friends, 
and all those she has served through-
out her time at the center to thank her 
for her outstanding efforts to better 
the lives of others, and I wish her many 
happy years of retirement. 
LAW AND ORDER IN AMERICA 
Mr. COMER. In recent weeks, Amer-
ican cities have been plagued by irre-
sponsible, reckless violence and riot-
ing. The violence in cities from Port-
land to Chicago has been out of con-
trol, requiring a Federal response to 
quell what has turned into full-on mob 
violence. 
This 
behavior 
has 
severe 
con-
sequences for American life. Businesses 
destroyed, chaos and disruption, and 
unacceptable levels of violence. 
And what has the Democratic re-
sponse been to violent outbreaks? 
Turning a blind eye to vandalism and 
destruction, along with a fresh round 
of calls to defund the police. 
At a time of rising violence, busi-
nesses being vandalized, and the lives 
of everyday citizens being disrupted, 
prominent Democratic politicians have 
sought to reduce the presence of Amer-
ican law enforcement. 
In calling efforts to defund the police 
a local decision, Speaker PELOSI has 
given a green light to mayors who have 
eagerly 
implemented 
that 
reckless 
movement. Thankfully, Federal law 
enforcement has stepped in to help out 
in cities where weak-kneed, incom-
petent mayors have failed to protect 
their citizens. 
Even though Federal agents have 
been shamelessly treated as enemies by 
far-left 
mayors, 
Federal 
reinforce-
ments were necessary in the face of 
local failures. 
I am 100 percent in favor of peaceful 
assembly and protest. It is an Amer-
ican tradition for our citizens to speak 
out and to use our sacred First Amend-
ment rights for good. And when there 
is legitimate police misconduct, like 
what we saw in Minneapolis, non-
violent protest is absolutely justified. 
However, the violence in our streets 
has been anything but peaceful. And 
when protestors start vandalizing and 
destroying property, including Federal 
courthouses, a line is crossed. We must 
have law and order and respect for the 
rule of law. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my Democratic 
colleagues will join me in calling for 
just that. Stop pushing to defund the 
police. Stop condoning mob violence. 
Support peaceful protest, not out-of- 
control rioting. We can and we must 
have free expression in this country, 
but we also must have law and order 
when protest turns into rioting and 
threatens the safety of our commu-
nities. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4209 
July 31, 2020 
RECOGNITION OF FORMER LEGISLATIVE 
DIRECTORS 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague and next-door neighbor 
from Kentucky for yielding to me. 
Mr. Speaker, the legislative director, 
together with the legislative staff, ad-
vises congressmen on legislative issues. 
This position assists in the develop-
ment of policy positions and legislative 
initiatives and assists in managing the 
office’s legislative staff. 
Restated in my language, the nuts 
and bolts of everything legislative goes 
through the legislative director. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been blessed with 
seven legislative directors. All of them 
are truly professional. All of them I 
would like to thank today. Many of 
them spent many years with me. A 
couple held the job long enough for a 
cup of coffee. All have moved on to big-
ger and better things. 
Cheryl Crate, originally from Okla-
homa, was my first legislative director. 
She helped set up my office and got it 
running smoothly. 
Dan Blankenburg is from Downers 
Grove, Illinois. He has a starring role 
in ‘‘Mr. SHIMKUS Goes to Washington,’’ 
as we were talking about U.S. military 
involvement in the Balkans. 
Morna Willens is from St. Charles, Il-
linois. She moved up to legislative di-
rector from her telecom legislative as-
sistant position. With that move, she 
was enticed to work downtown, and is 
still a D.C. operative. 
Ray Fitzgerald moved to my office 
from the Science Committee. Ray was 
from Chicago and a rabid White Sox 
fan. Ray was with me for many years, 
which we both considered successful, 
but Ray got married and wanted to go 
back home. Unfortunately, Ray was 
struck with cancer and died at the 
young age of 37. He left behind his wife, 
Kristin, and daughters, Nora, Maggie, 
and Lucy. They will always be part of 
Team Shimkus. 
What could be another one for the 
record books is two legislative direc-
tors who served in the same office get-
ting married. No one would ever guess 
me to be a cupid, but the proof is in the 
pudding. Their friendship and courting 
were never really news to me, but over 
the years, their strong marriage has 
become a sense of pride. 
Mo Zilly-Tracy is from Aurora, Illi-
nois—and how do you say this tact-
fully—was the boss to Ryan, my then 
legislative assistant for Agriculture 
and Energy. Once she left the legisla-
tive director position, Ryan accepted 
it. Then they got married, and moved 
to Ryan’s hometown in Monticello, Illi-
nois, and are raising their two daugh-
ters, Vivian and Alice. 
Greta Joynes is from Sugar Grove, Il-
linois. A tough, no-nonsense legislative 
director. I once called her my kraken 
that I would unleash. How did I ever 
come up with that? Now a D.C. opera-
tive, she is still a tough public policy 
operative. 
All but one of my LDs were from Illi-
nois. What a great credit to the State, 
but I am from southern Illinois, so it 
has been with great pride to have a 
local boy from my neck of the woods as 
my legislative director the last couple 
of years. 
Brian Looser is from an area between 
Staunton and Mount Olive. He came 
from the office of Senator Kirk and 
specializes in healthcare. He has also 
recently taken over the telecom port-
folio. He has decided to go down with 
the ship and stay with me until the 
end. That loyalty should be applauded 
and is emblematic of all my staff in 
D.C. 
Mr. Speaker, in the hustle and bustle 
of D.C. activity, people come and go all 
the time. The individuals who work 
with and for us should be thanked. We 
are only as good as the people around 
us, and I have been blessed with great 
staff. 
Again, I thank my colleague from the 
Commonwealth 
of 
Kentucky, 
my 
neighbor from Paducah, for allowing 
me a chance to speak. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIM-
KUS). I thank him for his service to this 
body, and I thank him for his friend-
ship. He has been an institution here in 
Congress. He has been a good neighbor. 
He has made a difference not just in 
southern Illinois, but in the United 
States of America, and I want him to 
know how much I appreciate his men-
toring, his friendship, the work we 
have done together to help benefit the 
Ohio River-Mississippi River region of 
America. 
Mr. Speaker, I will say that he has 
left big shoes to fill. I congratulate him 
on his upcoming retirement, and I ap-
preciate everything that he has done 
for me, for our colleagues, and for the 
United States of America. 
MYSTERIOUS SEEDS IN THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
been concerned as a farmer and former 
commissioner of agriculture to learn in 
recent days that mysterious seeds have 
been sent from China to people in all 50 
States encouraging them to plant these 
mysterious seeds. 
I say publicly what we are hearing 
from leaders in the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture and from my former col-
leagues in the State ranks, the com-
missioners, and directors of agriculture 
in all 50 States: If you get these seeds, 
do not—and I repeat—do not, plant 
these seeds. We have no idea what 
these seeds are. And these seeds could 
be potentially deadly to our ecosystem. 
b 1315 
We have seen so many shenanigans 
coming out of the China region. We 
don’t know exactly who it is, who they 
are. But we have seen concerns in cy-
bersecurity, and we have seen concerns 
in trade with currency manipulation, 
with stealing our patents, with steal-
ing our intellectual property. This is 
one more concern. 
So, I have written a letter and asked 
the Secretary of Agriculture, who is in-
vestigating this, Sonny Perdue, to give 
me a briefing and give the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform and the Com-
mittee on Agriculture a briefing as to 
what is going on with this. 
We do know that there are some peo-
ple, unknowing of the damages, who 
have planted these seeds. 
Again, I encourage people—and it is 
not just people in the agriculture com-
munity. It is just common citizens, 
random people, in all 50 States who 
have gotten these seeds. 
This is something that I am con-
cerned with as a leader in agriculture, 
someone who has spent my whole life 
involved in the agriculture industry, 
and I hope that I can utilize my posi-
tion in the agriculture community and 
as the ranking Republican on the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform to be 
able to determine the genesis of these 
seeds, who sent these seeds, what their 
purpose was. If we need to hold those 
people accountable for trying to create 
mischief and disruption in our agri-
culture industry, then I hope that we 
can work hard to hold them account-
able. 
I want to conclude my time today, 
Mr. Speaker, thanking my colleagues 
in Congress for their confidence to 
name me as ranking Republican of the 
House Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. I take this position with a great 
amount of honor and humility. 
I understand the role of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. The 
Committee on Oversight and Reform 
was created to provide oversight. It 
was created to ensure the Federal Gov-
ernment is transparent and account-
able to the taxpayers. 
We 
have 
seen 
an 
unprecedented 
amount of deficit spending in this 
body, too much spending. It is immoral 
what Congress has done over the last 
decade, with respect to the deficit and 
the national debt, to our children and 
grandchildren. 
Somebody in Congress needs to get 
the back of the taxpayers, and I pledge 
today that that somebody is going to 
be the House Oversight and Reform 
Committee, at least from the minority 
standpoint. My colleagues, my Repub-
lican colleagues on the committee, we 
are committed to defending the tax-
payer, committed to rooting out waste, 
fraud, and abuse. 
Unfortunately, for the past year-and- 
a-half, the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform has been focused on one thing, 
not oversight, not having the backs of 
the taxpayer. They have been focused 
on one thing, and that has been trying 
to embarrass the President of the 
United States, trying to use that com-
mittee as a political tool, as a sub-
sidiary of the Democratic Congres-
sional Campaign Committee, to try to 
find something, anything, on Donald 
Trump. And I can say with confidence, 
after a year-and-a-half, they have 
failed. 
What we need to do, what I challenge 
my colleague, Chairwoman MALONEY, 
to do is focus on the real purpose of the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4210 
July 31, 2020 
There is no shortage of waste, fraud, 
and abuse in the Federal Government. 
There is no shortage of opportunities 
to find a lack of transparency and ac-
countability in the massive bureauc-
racies that have been created by this 
body in the Federal Government. 
I am looking forward to the chal-
lenges that lie ahead. I couldn’t ask for 
a better committee than what we have, 
a committee roster. We have people on 
our side and the Democrat side who are 
committed to the real purpose of over-
sight and reform. I am looking forward 
to that. 
I, again, thank this body for the 
honor to serve in that capacity. I look 
forward to making a difference and get-
ting the back of the forgotten Ameri-
cans, the Americans who work hard, 
who go to work. 
They never stopped going to work be-
cause of the coronavirus. They go to 
work. They pay their taxes. They abide 
by the law. They don’t destroy prop-
erty. They go to church on Sundays. 
They do everything right, yet they 
are always forgotten in this body. 
Whether it is a government program, 
whether it is tax policy, whether it is 
the use of their hard-earned tax dol-
lars, they are always forgotten. We are 
going to put them on the forefront, and 
we are going to get the backs of the 
taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS) for 30 minutes. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the Speaker’s staff for allocating some 
time at the conclusion of our legisla-
tive session. 
Mr. Speaker, this has been a remark-
able 2 weeks in Washington. The ses-
sion began on a remorseful note with 
the departure of our beloved John 
Lewis. We have been able to come to-
gether to recognize his life’s work, his 
messages, his passion, his dedication to 
this country. 
Many of us, as his colleagues, can 
look back and feel so grateful for the 
time that we had with Mr. Lewis. I am 
looking over at where he used to sit. 
He would make time for every single 
one of us. 
Mr. Speaker, I also asked for this 
time because, as I was walking down 
the steps after our last vote, I felt a 
sense of profound reflection, reflection 
that is coming across our news feeds, 
the headlines. 
Obviously, 
Washington 
is 
always 
making news. They are looking at us, 
and they are wondering if we are going 
to get a deal done. The American peo-
ple are looking at us in the sense of: 
Are we going to get a deal done for 
them? 
My colleague on the other side of the 
aisle, Mr. COMER, I happened to catch 
some of his remarks. I really appre-
ciate what he had to say about our 
work and contribution for the Amer-
ican taxpayer. 
See, I share that belief that we must 
have a return on the taxpayer dollar. I 
have so many constituents, so many 
Michiganders who pay their taxes, and 
they look for that realized return on 
that taxpayer dollar that comes into 
this government. 
They saw us act in a moment of pro-
found need when it was realized that 
this pandemic was going to rage war 
here in America. 
Now, those heavy headlines before us, 
Mr. Speaker, are headlines that 150,000 
Americans have lost their lives to the 
coronavirus scourge. Countless fami-
lies, countless friends, countless work-
places, countless places of worship— 
our communities are changed. 
150,000, Mr. Speaker, is more than the 
largest town in my district. I want to 
absorb that number for a minute be-
cause I know people are counting on 
us. I know they are looking to us. 
I know they saw us act in a moment 
of triage when we had to get that 
CARES Act done to secure the liveli-
hoods for the hardworking people of 
this country, to allow us to success-
fully hibernate, to secure our indus-
trial base, to support our municipali-
ties, and to do so fairly, with a return. 
I don’t seek to act in this body other 
than to deliver for the people who sent 
me here. I certainly don’t look to wage 
felicitous dialogue that doesn’t con-
tribute to an outcome. I take so seri-
ously every time I have the oppor-
tunity to stand on this floor, to sit in 
these chairs—oftentimes now we are up 
in the gallery—and to listen. 
See, I came to Washington with this 
commitment to the people who sent me 
here, that I will listen, I will learn, and 
I will lead, in that order. 
You make a mistake when you start 
off thinking you have all the answers 
right away. We are here because we 
want 
to 
get 
something 
done. 
We 
haven’t finished the deal. 
The House passed the HEROES Act. I 
know my educators back home are lis-
tening, looking, and waiting. $750 per 
pupil cut. How are we going to reopen 
our schools safely, Mr. Speaker, if we 
don’t close the budget gap? 
How are we going to tell our small 
businesses and our municipalities that 
they are able to continue in their func-
tion if we don’t show them we have 
their back? That is what our Com-
mittee on Small Business is doing. 
That was that first amendment I got 
done on this House floor last year. It 
was called the Stevens amendment. It 
was part of the Consumers First Act, 
and it was for the voice of small busi-
ness. 
I went right over there when we were 
in 
different 
times 
of 
nonsocial 
distancing, and I asked my colleagues, 
I said: ‘‘Hey, I am over here asking for 
your vote, and I am asking for it be-
cause it is here to bring the voice of 
small business and the industry advi-
sory board of the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau, the voice of small 
business.’’ 
One man looks up at me, and he says: 
‘‘You know what? Because you are ask-
ing so nicely, I am going to vote for 
it.’’ And another guy said: ‘‘You know 
what? I will change my vote.’’ 
That amendment passed 400–8. I re-
member all eight of my colleagues who 
didn’t vote for the amendment, of 
course. I continue to work on them. 
We find these opportunities where we 
can come together and deliver. It is 
only a small handful of us. 
Our manufacturers are watching as 
they are working. See, they go in every 
single day, producing the goods that 
fuel this country, that put this country 
on 
wheels, 
this 
incredible 
inter-
connected supply chain that we have, 
proudly, in my district, Mr. Speaker. 
We love that supply chain. 
They don’t ask: Are you a Democrat 
or a Republican? They just get to 
work. And at some point, we must im-
plore and ask something better of our-
selves beyond party. 
When we reflect on the scourge of 
this coronavirus and the magnitude of 
the loss, I am not here to play the 
blame game. Yes, I am frustrated that 
we seem so possessed by the elections 
coming that we are not even focused on 
running the government. When my dis-
trict team back home, as we try and 
help constituents—$1.4 million back 
into the taxpayer pocketbook, that is 
what we have been able to do with our 
case management work. 
But today, when we call, it is like 
trying to open the lid of a can that 
can’t open. These agencies need to be 
unleashed. They need to be better con-
nected to those who they are intending 
to serve. 
You go to run for an executive office, 
to run the executive office in the 
branches of the government of which 
the taxpayers are paying for when they 
have a problem. 
We are in a static time, Mr. Speaker. 
We are in a challenging time. The lid 
has ripped off of so many issues: the 
plight toward equality, the plight to-
ward freedom, the plight toward true 
justice, to make sure that every vote 
counts fairly. That is why we did all 
these amazing election security bills, 
one of which I had the privilege of 
chairing a hearing on, on the House 
Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology, which, by the way, is such 
a special committee. 
Right before this pandemic hit, our 
incredible chair, a mentor, someone I 
deeply admire, Chairwoman EDDIE BER-
NICE
JOHNSON
from Texas, with Mr. 
LUCAS from Oklahoma, passed, in full 
committee, a bipartisan energy and 
R&D package. 
How are we going to solve our cli-
mate change problems? We must do so 
together. We must realize that our big-
gest challenges are our greatest oppor-
tunities. 
I am here for the policy, Mr. Speaker. 
I am here for the deliberation, the dia-
logue, and the discourse of this country

that will move us forward and solve 
our problems. I don’t look at the 
coronavirus as a Democrat or a Repub-
lican issue. It is something that we 
face together as Americans. 
I walked into the Treasury Depart-
ment in the very early days of 2009 dur-
ing a financial crisis, the teetering of 
the American economy before us, dif-
ferent than what we are facing today. 
b 1330 
We are stalemated today. We are 
stagnant today. We have unbelievable 
unemployment, which is totally unac-
ceptable. 
Last time I checked, I am in the 
party of jobs. I am in the party of get-
ting people back to work. I am in the 
party that believes that people make 
things for a living, and we value and 
honor that work through a 21st century 
organized labor movement that keeps 
people safe, that allows them to retire 
with dignity. We say that to every 
hardworking American. 
I have the privilege of being able to 
get things done here. When I walked 
into the Treasury Department with my 
colleagues in the Obama administra-
tion, the Bush administration was 
there waiting for us. They hunkered 
down, and they said: We want to work 
alongside you. 
We had a bipartisan team on the U.S. 
Auto Rescue. We said we are going to 
stand up for the industrial economy, 
the Main Street effort of what we need-
ed to do to stabilize our Nation’s econ-
omy, and we did so together. And I feel 
that here, despite the friction, despite 
the frustration. 
I realized earlier this session, as I 
was reflecting on the most benevolent 
man I ever had the privilege to know, 
a walking saint, Mr. John Lewis, he 
said, in my reflection and remarks 
about him, Mr. Speaker, that he was 
the richest man I had ever known, be-
cause richness is defined by how much 
you love. And, boy, did he give out that 
love. 
In reflecting on that, Mr. Speaker, I 
realized the opposite of that is that ar-
rogance and insecurity are the cousins 
of one another, are a poison to our dis-
course. They prevent us from having 
the discussions and committing to the 
work that we need to do, and we need 
to put that down. The perception of ev-
erything. It is the outcome, it is the 
product, it is the result, that is what 
gleans out of all the manufacturers in 
my district. It is not a chimera. It is a 
produced, manufactured result. 
And so I reflect, Mr. Speaker, with 
the energy, the hope, and the opti-
mism. 
If you recall, with our freshman 
class, when we began session and Mr. 
COLIN ALLRED and I became the cere-
monial presidents of the freshman 
class, we said during one of our ori-
entation sessions, we hearkened to the 
words—I found these words of Presi-
dent Truman, who said that America is 
not built on fear. America is built on 
courage, America is built on deter-
mination, and America is built on the 
willingness to do the job at hand. 
My friends, we have a job to do; we 
have legislation to pass; and we shall 
get this done for our schools, for our 
healthcare workers, for every Amer-
ican who is wondering how they are 
going to pay their rent, where their 
next job is going to be, how their kid is 
going to go to school safely. That is 
the job that we are determined to do 
here. 
And if you actually listen to what 
my colleague was saying on the other 
side of the aisle before I got to this po-
dium, it is not that different from one 
another. We are restored, we are re-
newed, and we are committed to the te-
nets of this beautiful, incredible de-
mocracy in this sacred space, this 
House floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to offer this amendment, which speci-
fies that $30 million dollars already provided 
within NASA’s Science Mission Directorate 
should be set aside for NASA to procure dedi-
cated small launch services for its small sat-
ellite missions. 
This amendment builds off report language 
included in the FY21 Commerce, Justice, 
Science bill that directs NASA to work with in-
dustry to procure tailored launch services for 
small satellite science missions. It does not in-
crease spending or transfer money from other 
line items. 
I would like to thank my colleagues, Rep. 
STEVEN PALAZZO and DARREN SOTO, for their 
leadership and support on this amendment. 
Small satellites are playing a big role in our 
country’s space efforts. They are low-cost, 
easy to produce, and capably achieve a range 
of missions—including climate and weather 
monitoring and communications links that con-
nect the world. They support our nation’s sol-
diers in theater, provide hands-on research 
and learning opportunities for students across 
the country, and augment our deep space ex-
ploration. To support these satellite missions, 
a market has developed where companies 
building and operating small rockets to provide 
what is called ‘‘dedicated launch’’—taking 
these satellites where they need to be, when 
they need to be there. 
Long Beach, California, in my district, is 
home to several of these small launch compa-
nies. Together, they employ over a thousand 
individuals in high-skill, high-wage jobs. They 
are the future of our industrial ingenuity, tech-
nological leadership, and inspiration for the 
next generation to pursue STEM and aero-
space careers. 
Dedicated 
small 
launch 
will 
maximize 
NASA’s returns on small satellite science mis-
sions by lowering costs, increasing launch op-
portunities, and taking these satellites exactly 
where they need to be. I am pleased to offer 
and support this amendment, which will build 
off the momentum the Appropriations Com-
mittee has established to enable greater 
science, research, and education using small 
satellites and small launch. 
I urge my colleagues to also support this 
amendment, and our country’s continued lead-
ership in aerospace. 
IN MEMORY OF MR. JOE LENHARD 
HON. CHARLES J. ‘‘CHUCK’’ 
FLEISCHMANN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 31, 2020 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Joe Lenhard of Oak Ridge, 
Tennessee and recognize his lifetime of serv-
ice in his community and to our nation. Mr. 
Lenhard passed away on July 17, 2020. 
Born on June 18, 1929 outside of Detroit, 
Mr. Lenhard graduated from East Detroit High 
School in 1947 and enlisted in the U.S. Navy. 
He came to Oak Ridge in 1957 for summer 
training and stayed in the city for the rest of 
his life. 
Mr. Lenhard served at the U.S. Department 
of Energy for 32-years, from 1957 to 1982 and 
for the last 15-years of his employment, he 
was responsible for all research and develop-
ment activities within Oak Ridge Operations. 
During his career with the DOE, Mr. Lenhard 
received numerous federal awards for his 
work at the Department’s Oak Ridge Oper-
ations. After his retirement in 1989 with 35- 
years of federal service, he was an active 
member of the local community serving as the 
Oak Ridge Chamber of Commerce president 
in 1992 and chair of the East-Tennessee Eco-
nomic Council in 1993 and 1994. He also in 
1994, helped to found CROET which helps to 
find ways to reuse former federal assets such 
as property and equipment. 
Beyond his service to Oak Ridge, Mr. 
Lenhard was a generous benefactor to the 
University of Tennessee and Roane State 
Community College, and often shared his 
memories and history of Oak Ridge with local 
reporters and members of the community. 
Joe Lenhard was a great patriot and a dedi-
cated servant to his nation and community. 
East-Tennessee and the City of Oak Ridge 
have lost a great man, and I am honored to 
join with countless others to remember and 
honor a true American patriot.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. DAVID J. TRONE 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 31, 2020 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, had I been 
present for roll call vote 172 to approve H.R. 
7327, the Child Care for Economic Recovery 
Act, I would have voted YEA. 
HONORING RICK DOYLE 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 31, 2020 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Rick Doyle on 
his retirement. 
In 1979, Mr. Doyle was admitted to the Cali-
fornia State Bar, after receiving his law degree 
from the University of the Pacific, McGeorge 
School of Law. For ten years he specialized in 
municipal finance and business litigation with 
the Law Firm of Jensen and Doyle. In 1989, 
he began working with the City of San Jose as 
a Senior Deputy Attorney and was later pro-
moted to Chief Deputy Attorney in 1992. He 
left for five years to work as City Attorney in 
Concord, but returned to San Jose in 2000, to 
be City Attorney. In his twenty years of service 
since then, he has advised three different 
mayors, 38 councilmembers and six city man-
agers during his tenure. 
Throughout this time, he has dedicated him-
self to helping San Jose move forward no 
matter what challenges arose. As City Attor-
ney, Mr. Doyle, worked on a wide array of 
issues from lawsuits against the city, to bring-
ing initiatives forward, to making sure that the 
process is fair and followed by everyone. With 
each day, he would face new and interesting 
challenges from negotiating with the FAA for a 
new San Jose Airport curfew, to advising the 
city during challenges to pension reductions 
for public employees. While his work was at 
times in the background to the public, his im-
pact was great on our community. 
Mr. Doyle has helped navigate our city 
through many obstacles and through many 
changes. We thank him for his commitment to 
San Jose and for dedicating his life to public 
service. I wish him the very best in his retire-
ment and on this exciting next stage of his life.

from economic activity these contributions 
bring to our state. This funding will help spur 
Connecticut’s economy during these difficult 
times and secure thousands of jobs at larger 
employers like Pratt & Whitney and hundreds 
of smaller suppliers across the First District 
and the state. 
Throughout the years, the Connecticut dele-
gation has worked hand in glove with sup-
pliers, companies, and educators to bring 
Connecticut to the forefront of advanced man-
ufacturing. The Delegation, led by JOE COURT-
NEY and ROSA DELAURO, have worked hard to 
ensure not only the manufacturing base, but 
the supply chain remain on top. This was re-
cently demonstrated in the Hartford Courant, 
which cited a Pew Charitable Trusts Study 
that said: ‘Pentagon contract spending powers 
Connecticut to No. 1 in US.’ This builds on the 
work of the F–35 Joint Strike fighter caucus 
which I’m proud to co-chair. This is good news 
for our supply chain and economy during a 
time when commercial spending is down. 
These military contracts will keep these jobs 
going. 
In addition to the vital funding that directly 
contributes to our state, this package fights 
back against the President’s ill-conceived bor-
der wall, by preventing the use of Defense 
funds being used for the wall. It also ensures 
that the President cannot go to war without 
Congress’s authorization by prohibiting funds 
from being used in contravention of the War 
Powers Resolution. It specifically prohibits 
funds for any use of military force in or against 
Iran and repeals both the 2001 and the 2002 
war authorizations. The power to go to war 
lies with Congress, not the President. These 
are important provisions to ensure the Execu-
tive Branch does not overstep its authority. 
The passage of the FY 2021 Labor-HHS 
Appropriations package is a win for millions of 
Social Security beneficiaries. It blocks a pro-
posed rule that would dramatically increase 
the frequency of continuing disability reviews. 
These reviews can be extremely difficult for in-
dividuals with severe disabilities to navigate 
and can lead to wrongful loss of Social Secu-
rity and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) 
benefits when they are unable to complete the 
complex process. This rule was an attempt to 
throw beneficiaries off the rolls. The bill also 
blocks a Trump Administration proposed rule 
to deny individuals their right to appeal a de-
nial of Social Security or SSI benefits before 
an Administrative Law Judge. 
I am thankful for the leadership of Chair-
women NITA LOWEY and ROSA DELAURO for 
making this happen. Chairwoman DELAURO al-
ways fights for the least among us and she 
continued that with this bill.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of three amendments to H.R. 
7617. 
My amendment, offered with Mr. WITTMAN, 
Ms. LURIA, and Mr. BEYER, reflects the need to 
adequately fund the important work done at 
Jefferson Lab. JLab, in my district in Newport 
News, is home to the Continuous Electron 
Beam Accelerator Facility, also known as 
CEBAF, the primary research tool in the U.S. 
for enabling basic research on the quark and 
gluon structure of protons and neutrons. 
Worldwide, a community of more than 1,700 
scientists from over 275 institutions depend on 
this facility for their research. 
The City of Newport News has agreed to 
transfer ownership of a building to the Lab to 
support its work, but the $2 million included in 
this year’s appropriations bills fall short of the 
$9 million needed to transfer that building and 
move forward with the renovation and expan-
sion of CEBAF, for which the Department of 
Energy has already approved Critical Decision 
0. 
I also rise today in support of the amend-
ment offered with my colleagues, Mr. WITT-
MAN, 
Mr. 
MCEACHIN, 
Ms. 
LURIA, 
Ms. 
SPANBERGER, and Ms. WEXTON, in regard to 
the urgent need for robust funding to the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers for coastal construc-
tion projects. The Army Corps has worked to 
keep America’s waterways and ports open to 
trade, while working with our communities to 
ensure that they can continue to live with the 
water that surrounds Hampton Roads. 
My district is home to the Port of Virginia 
which is one of the largest and busiest ports 
on the eastern seaboard. With 95 percent of 
our nation’s trade moving by water, it is es-
sential that the port is able to maintain oper-
ations. The Port of Virginia is responsible for 
nearly $40 billion in economic activity in the 
Commonwealth of Virginia. It is critical to our 
financial well-being that we ensure that the 
Port is able to handle to the increased number 
and size of containers. The Port and the Army 
Corps of Engineers have undertaken the 
dredging and widening and deepening of the 
Norfolk Harbor to enable safe and efficient 
two-way passage of the new larger container 
ships. The project will require a New Start 
designation to keep the projected time line in-
tact. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting additional funding to support our Na-
tional Labs and the construction at the Norfolk 
Harbor to keep both of these essential 
projects moving forward. 
I also rise in support of Rep. MURPHY’s 
amendment which I was proud to cosponsor, 
as co-chair of the Modeling and Simulation 
Caucus, along with Rep. BERGMAN, an active 
caucus member. This amendment emphasizes 
the importance of funding for the Synthetic 
Training Environment (STE) account. Funding 
for the Synthetic Training Environment pro-
gram is an investment in simulation tech-
nology to help service members train virtually 
for their missions. Advancing modeling and 
simulation technology is a long-term invest-
ment that enables us to remain competitive in 
with innovations in medicine, training, and 
transportation and I urge my colleagues to 
support these investments.

HONORING MRS. EVELYN 
WILLIAMS 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 31, 2020 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with great joy that I rise to rec-
ognize a very special birthday for a beloved 
constituent of Florida’s 23rd Congressional 
District. 
Mrs. Evelyn Williams celebrates her 105th 
birthday on August 2, 2020. 
Mrs. Williams is a resident of Dania Beach 
and has spent a long life as a pioneer and 
community leader. Born in 1915, she has wit-
nessed over a century of development and so-
cietal evolution. Mrs. Williams was born in 
Mosely Town, Georgia and raised in neigh-
boring Vidalia. She and her husband Alonzo 
Williams moved to Coconut Grove, Florida in 
1935. 
Mrs. Williams served as a Sunday School 
teacher, Deaconess, and as a Mission Society 
representative, regularly visiting ailing and el-
derly people in the neighborhood and local 
nursing home. 
Her contributions to her church are matched 
by her quiet but encouraging influence in the 
community. She financially supported many 
young people in the area in pursuing their col-
lege education and professional goals. She 
served in the Broward Civic Improvement As-
sociation—a community service organization 
active in Dania Beach—during the 1950s and 
1960s. 
Mrs. Williams has also been commended for 
serving Broward County as a dedicated poll 
worker for more than 50 years, registering vot-
ers and carrying the message that voting is a 
responsibility and privilege. 
She has been recognized by both the Dania 
Beach Historical Society and Broward County 
Historical Commission as a Broward County 
Pioneer. She remains an active member of the 
New Jerusalem Baptist Church and I am 
grateful to the New Jerusalem family for com-
ing together so we may all celebrate this spe-
cial occasion. 
It is with great pride that I represent Mrs. 
Evelyn Williams and the residents of Dania 
Beach in our nation’s capital. I thank Mayor 
Lori Lewellen, the Members of the City Com-
mission, and the city staff for protecting the 
wellbeing of our residents and for working tire-
lessly to make the City of Dania Beach a won-
derful place to live, work, visit, and raise a 
family.

Thomas ‘‘Tom’’ Pinnell III, who will be pro-
moted to the rank of Major this weekend. 
Capt. Pinnell was commissioned into the Ma-
rine Corps in 2010. A college baseball athlete, 
Capt. Pinnell has earned the Marine Corps Air 
Station Miramar’s ‘‘Athlete of the Year’’ award 
not once, but twice. He may not reach the sta-
tus of a future Hall of Famer like Yadier 
Molina of his cherished St. Louis Cardinals, 
but Capt. Pinnell’s athleticism set him up to 
represent Team USA in the CISM Military 
World Cup. 
Capt. Pinnell has also given back to the Ma-
rine Corps as a top recruiter, selecting the 
best and brightest to lead the next generation 
of Marines. His expertise won him the title of 
‘‘Recruiter of the Year’’ of the Midwestern Re-
gion. 
In the coming months, Capt. Pinnell will 
transition from active duty to the reserves in 
order to begin a promising career in the prac-
tice of law. Capt. Pinnell and his wonderful 
wife, Lisa, just welcomed into the world their 
third child, Weston, little brother to Theo and 
Davis. 
Capt. Pinnell is a loving father who has 
given many years of service to this great na-
tion. Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Capt. Pinnell for his promotion and 
in wishing him all the best on his endeavors.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Soto Amendment, 
Soto number 77 to Division B, the Department 
of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Re-
lated Agencies Appropriations Act of 2021, 
specified that at least $40,000,000 from the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion’s Planetary Science budget to be applied 
to the general budget and applied to the Near 
Earth Object Surveillance Mission (NEOSM). 
Space may be vast, but it’s not empty. Earth 
is bombarded by tiny space rocks called mete-
ors every day, most of which burn up in our 
atmosphere. Larger meteors, like the one that 
exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013, 
can damage buildings and cause minor inju-
ries. And on rare occasions, asteroids and 
comets strike Earth and cause global devasta-
tion—the dinosaurs perished when this hap-
pened 66 million years ago. 
NEOSM is a 50-centimeter-wide telescope. 
Its camera sees things in infrared wave-
lengths—a type of light not visible to human 
eyes. Infrared light reveals heat signatures, 
which is perfect for asteroids because they are 
very dark and hard to see against the black-
ness of space. In infrared light, they glow be-
cause they heat up in the Sun and re-radiate 
that heat back into space. 
This is the impetus behind NEOSM, NASA’s 
Near-Earth 
Object 
Surveillance 
Mission. 
NEOSM would launch as soon as 2025 and 
within 10 years meet Congress’s goal of find-
ing 90 percent of near-Earth objects 140 me-
ters and wider. Finding and studying these ob-
jects will not only help us figure out if any are 
on course to hit Earth, but will also help lay 
the groundwork for survey and deflection mis-
sions if one is found. 
I support ensuring funding for the Near 
Earth Surveillance Mission efforts to identify 
potentially hazard near Earth objects and 
thank my colleagues for their support of my 
amendment.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 7617, the Defense, Com-
merce, Justice, Science, Energy and Water 
Development, Financial Services and General 
Government, Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices, Education, Transportation, Housing, and 
Urban Development Appropriations Act, for fis-
cal year 2021, which has included multiple of 
my priorities critical to the communities I rep-
resent. These provisions fund our nation’s 
most critical programs that support individuals, 
families, and communities throughout their life-
span, from Early Head Start to Social Security. 
We are dedicated to investing in programs 
that provide opportunities so that every person 
has a better chance at a better life—with a 
good education, a good job, and access to af-
fordable healthcare. 
This bill provides modest increases for the 
National Science Foundation and the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology. The 
National Science Foundation is the only agen-
cy to fund research across all fields of science 
and engineering, and the most important 
agency in terms of ensuring a diverse pipeline 
of STEM talent across our nation. The Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology is 
the global leader in measurement science and 
standards, and as such plays a central role in 
U.S. competitiveness across all sectors of our 
economy. However, it is one of most under-
funded agencies in our government for what it 
is asked to do and what it is capable of doing 
for our nation. In addition, our nation’s 
progress in industries of the future such as ar-
tificial intelligence, quantum science, and 5G 
will simply not be possible without increased 
investments in these two agencies. I truly un-
derstand the difficult and sometimes delicate 
trade-offs that my Appropriations colleagues 
had to make in crafting this legislation. How-
ever, I urge my colleagues across Congress to 
find a way to invest in our nation’s future by 
investing more in our nation’s STEM talent. 
Regarding funding for the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration (NASA), I 
am pleased that the bill rejects the proposed 
cuts to high-priority science projects, including 
those that will provide important climate 
change measurements, and science, tech-
nology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) 
programs. We simply cannot afford to cut-off 
our future—the building of our next genera-
tion’s skills and the development of a 21st 
century workforce. Overall, the bill sustains 
NASA’s multi-mission portfolio at the Fiscal 
Year 2020 enacted level of $22.629 billion, 
providing level or near-level funding for 
NASA’s science, exploration, and space tech-
nology accounts, and provides $35 million in-
crease for aeronautics, which contributes im-
portant research and development for our na-
tion’s civil aviation and air transportation sys-
tem. The bill also sustains funding for critical 
exploration capabilities, including the Space 
Launch System and Orion crew vehicle. To-
ward that end, I’m pleased that the bill con-
tinues to fund the development of an explo-
ration upper stage-enabled Space Launch 
System, which will provide greater lift capacity 
to support our deep space exploration activi-
ties. In addition, the bill provides important 
flexibility to the agency in selecting a launch 
vehicle for the high-priority Europa Clipper 
science mission; that flexibility could help re-
duce overall mission cost while also seeking 
to expedite science results. It is also worth 
noting that the bill allows for up to $1 million 
from the Safety, Security, and Mission Serv-
ices account to be available to meet mandated 
payments to the Challenger Center as NASA 
explores alternative means to ensure the on-
going payments. 
With respect to the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration (FAA), the bill supports the Office of 
Commercial Space Transportation (AST)’s im-
portant functions of licensing and monitoring 
the safety of commercial space launches and 
reentries, as well as spaceports, at $27.555 
million, an increase of $1.515 million (6 per-
cent) from the FY 2020 enacted appropriation. 
I am also pleased that the bill sustains 
$192.665 million for the FAA’s research, engi-
neering, and development programs, which 
contribute R&D to improve the safety and effi-
ciency of the national airspace system and re-
duce the environmental impact. 
I am supportive of the $5.45 billion provided 
for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration (NOAA) in this bill, which is $828 
million above the Administration’s short-sight-
ed budget request. This includes robust in-
vestments in intramural and extramural re-
search at NOAA and restoration of funding to 
proposed cuts to, or eliminations of, coastal 
resilience grants, National Centers for Coastal 
Ocean Science, the National Sea Grant Pro-
gram, Tsunami Warning System, the Air Re-
sources Laboratory, and the NOAA Office of 
Education. At a time when Americans face 
compound threats of the COVID–19 pandemic 
on top of climate change-fueled intense heat, 
hurricanes, and other extreme weather events, 
it is imperative that we have accurate and 
timely climate and weather predictions, pre-
paredness, and response. I am pleased to see 
enhanced support for weather research, mod-
eling, and forecasting, as well as National 
Weather Service forecaster staffing levels. As 
our planet continues to warm, sea levels rise, 
ice sheets melt, and other changes occur due 
to anthropogenic climate change, authoritative 
climate research and information remains 
more important than ever to help our commu-
nities address these resulting impacts. I am

also pleased to see restored funding for au-
thoritative reports such as the National Cli-
mate Assessments and the Regional Inte-
grated Sciences and Assessments program to 
help provide regions with decision making 
support services and tools. 
This bill makes much needed investments at 
the Department of Energy, which supports the 
world-class facilities and expertise of our na-
tional laboratories as well as many important 
activities at our universities and in the private 
sector. DOE also serves as one of our most 
valuable tools in the fight against climate 
change. Alone, the $12.5 billion dedicated to 
DOE’s non-defense research, development, 
and demonstration activities in this bill would 
amount to a slight cut of 0.2 percent com-
pared to FY20 enacted levels. However, the 
bill also includes $12.4 billion in additional, 
critical research infrastructure investments. 
Thus DOE’s Office of Science, ARPA-E, and 
other applied energy programs would all re-
ceive significant funding increases under this 
bill, which would significantly enhance the de-
velopment of new clean energy technologies 
and provide valuable support to the U.S. re-
search enterprise when such support is des-
perately needed. 
I also want to speak on important provisions 
within the Health and Human Services funding 
division. In consideration of our current public 
health crisis, this appropriations bill rebuilds 
our nation’s aging public health infrastructure 
by providing $24.425 billion in emergency 
spending to support state and local public 
health departments, public health laboratories, 
and global health activities. This investment is 
essential to developing national resilience 
amid the current pandemic caused by the 
novel coronavirus and from future public 
health threats. We also have included oper-
ational and contingency funding to assist 
states with the unanticipated unemployment 
insurance workloads, as millions of individuals 
have come to rely on such benefits to survive 
the current economic turmoil. 
Among the multiple laudable improvements 
made in this bill, I am specifically encouraged 
by the inclusion of my report language on tele-
health training and education for Medicaid 
beneficiaries. Our nation has recognized the 
potential for telehealth, remote monitoring, and 
digital health technologies to help meet the 
needs of patients and families, especially dur-
ing 
this 
public 
health 
emergency. 
As 
healthcare providers expanding their delivery 
of virtual care, we must have a comprehensive 
understanding of the training and education 
needs of beneficiaries and caregivers on how 
to successfully utilize such telehealth services 
and technologies. My language directs the Ad-
ministration of Community Living to work with 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
and other stakeholders to develop such re-
sources that account for age-related dif-
ferences in our interactions with technology. 
With all that is happening across our nation, 
we must make sure that our communities 
have the mental health services and support 
their need to withstand and recover from these 
months of turmoil. That is why I am proud of 
the $21 million allocated for the National Sui-
cide Prevention Lifeline, which is $2 million 
more than last year. Additionally, this bill in-
cludes $758 million for the Community Mental 
Health Services Block Grant, which will pro-
vide our states and territories the mental 
health resources that are so needed during 
these times. 
This bill also includes critical funding for 
lupus programs, which I supported as co-chair 
of the Congressional Lupus Caucus. the Na-
tional Lupus Patient Registry at the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention is to re-
ceive $8.5 million, and the Office of Minority 
Health and their National Lupus Training, Out-
reach, and Clinical Trial Program is to receive 
$2 million. 
Now, let me turn my attention to the Edu-
cation funding division. As we continue to ad-
dress the needs of Americans during this pan-
demic, I am happy to see that this bill includes 
critical funding necessary to ensure our young 
people have access to quality education, 
whether it be at home, in school, or a hybrid 
model. I am particularly pleased to see the 
subcommittee recommend $28.5 million in 
funding for the Innovative Approaches to Lit-
eracy program. This is an increase of $1.5 mil-
lion over the Fiscal year 2020 funding level. 
The increased funding for this program will en-
sure that schools, libraries, and non-profits 
can continue providing books and other lit-
erary materials to families in high need com-
munities. As we try to address the stark dif-
ferences in educational opportunity during this 
pandemic, programs like IAL are needed more 
than ever to ensure underserved students do 
not fall further behind in the areas of literacy 
and writing. 
This bill also increases funding for Title I 
schools, Head Start, and special education 
programs, ensuring that the most vulnerable 
and needy get the services they need in the 
classroom. 
Regarding Higher Education, this bill in-
creases funding to various HBCU programs 
and raises the maximum Pell Grant amount by 
$150 to $6,495. This funding increase will help 
students keep up with the rising cost of higher 
education. 
Regarding the funding provisions for the De-
partment of Housing and Urban Development, 
I am pleased at the increased investments 
made to affordable housing and homelessness 
programs. We have dedicated $9.1 billion for 
the Office of Community Planning and Devel-
opment, an increase of $1.1 billion above the 
2020 enacted level. There is also $3.5 billion 
for Community Development Block Grants, a 
critical program that the President’s budget re-
quest proposed to eliminate. As co-chair of the 
Congressional Homelessness Caucus, I am 
very supportive of the $3.4 billion for Home-
less Assistance Grants, which is $638 million 
more than what was dedicated in fiscal year 
2020. Multiple other programs have also re-
ceived funding increases, including $103 mil-
lion for the Education for Homeless Children 
and Youth program, $140 million for Runaway 
and Homeless Youth program, and $57.5 mil-
lion for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration 
Program. With the economic upheaval caused 
by this coronavirus, we must be completely 
dedicated to preventing and alleviating home-
lessness, as that is the only way to lessen the 
difficulties currently experienced by our com-
munities. 
As representatives of Americans from all 
corners of our country, we have a responsi-
bility to protect the livelihood and well-being of 
our families and communities, especially dur-
ing this public health emergency. On behalf of 
the constituents of the 30th District of Texas, 
I urge my colleagues to support this funding 
bill for fiscal year 2021. 
RECOGNIZING UTAH TEACHERS 
AND EDUCATORS 
HON. BEN McADAMS 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 31, 2020 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, all of us 
have fond memories of a favorite teacher— 
someone who became a mentor that inspired 
us to reach for our dreams. In ordinary times, 
classrooms are where we discover—with help 
from our teachers—the doors an education will 
open for us as we pursue our passions. 
These are far from ordinary times. Just a 
few short months ago, kids left school on a 
Friday and then started the following Monday 
in an entirely new learning environment. They 
learned lessons from teachers talking to them 
on a computer screen, as teachers quickly 
shifted their lesson plans to online learning. 
Parents got a crash course in what it’s like to 
keep children engaged with assignments and 
learning over a seven-hour day. 
We have always asked a lot of our teachers 
and school principals in Utah. They juggle re-
sources that are stretched thin. They must be 
prepared to teach children with a range of 
learning styles and abilities. They wear many 
hats beside that of teachers—counselor, ref-
eree, nurse, bookkeeper, fundraiser and orga-
nizational expert. This fall, they are being test-
ed by a dramatically more difficult cir-
cumstance—preparing to go back to school in 
the face of a highly-contagious virus, about 
which not much is known, except that some-
times it can be lethal. 
I’m a father of four school-age children and 
the son of a teacher. I like to think that I value 
and appreciate the teaching profession and 
unique ability teachers have, to connect a curi-
ous child’s mind with knowledge, aspiration, 
and discipline. 
As this unprecedented fall 2020 school year 
approaches, as we all struggle to make sense 
of what classrooms this fall will look like, I 
would like to salute all Utah teachers and staff 
and thank them for their extraordinary dedica-
tion to their work and to our children.

gust 1, 2020; at the M.L. King Community 
Park. 
Before the 1955 arrest of Rosa Parks and 
the Montgomery bus boycott that followed, 
there was Sarah Keys Evans. Her refusal to 
give up her seat on an interstate charter bus 
prompted the landmark court case, Sarah 
Keys v. Carolina Coach Company, in which 
the Interstate Commerce Commission out-
lawed the segregation of Black passengers in 
buses traveling across state lines.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E715 
July 31, 2020 
On August 1, 1952, Women’s Army Corps, 
Private Sarah Keys, boarded a bus in Trenton, 
New Jersey for her first home visit to North 
Carolina since joining the military. The bus 
she boarded would take her directly to her 
North Carolina destination without any re-
quired bus changes. 
Once the bus reached Roanoke Rapids, 
North Carolina, a new driver took over the bus 
and as was custom, went through the bus and 
re-checked tickets. When he came to Ms. 
Keys, he told her to give up her seat to a 
white Marine who boarded the bus in Roanoke 
Rapids and move to the back of the bus. Tired 
from her long journey, Sarah refused. 
Frustrated with her persistence, the bus 
driver announced that all passengers would be 
moving to a different bus, but the woman who 
refused to change her seat, referring to Ms. 
Keys, would not be allowed to board the new 
bus and would not be allowed to continue the 
trip. 
Shortly thereafter, two police officers arrived 
at the bus terminal, took Sarah by the arms 
into a patrol car and drove her to the Roanoke 
Rapids police station. Because she refused to 
be subjected to unjust discrimination and prej-
udice, she was forced to stay in jail overnight 
and was fined before her release. Once Sarah 
arrived home and informed her family of the 
injustice she endured, her father encouraged 
her to seek legal action. 
The NAACP referred the family to attorney 
Dovey Johnson Roundtree, who brought her 
case before the Interstate Commerce Com-
mission. After battling initial rejection by an ex-
aminer and various barriers, three years later, 
the case was settled in 1955. In Sarah Keys 
v. Carolina Coach Company, the ICC ruled in 
favor of Keys Evans. In their decision, the 
Commission found the Interstate Commerce 
Act forbids segregation as the practice sub-
jects passengers to ‘‘unjust discrimination, and 
undue and unreasonable prejudice and dis-
advantage, in violation of Section 216(d) of the 
Interstate Commerce Act and is therefore un-
lawful.’’ 
The fight for civil rights in America is a story 
heavy laden with unsung heroes and hidden 
figures who paved the way to progress. I am 
glad to know, that through the creation of the 
Sarah Keys Evans Plaza in Roanoke Rapids, 
the story of Sarah Keys Evans, an Army vet-
eran and civil rights pioneer, will be displayed 
for all to see and learn from. It is my hope that 
her story of courage in the face of adversity 
will inspire others to never be afraid to stand 
up for what is right—even if that means stay-
ing in your seat. 
Madam Speaker, North Carolinian Sarah 
Keys Evans, now 91 years-old, is a living ex-
ample that change is possible if we are willing 
to stand up and fight for what is right. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in celebrating the unveil-
ing of the Sarah Keys Plaza in honor of a true 
civil rights pioneer.

SPEECH OF 
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of my two amendments, Amend-
ment No. 137 and Amendment No. 138, both 
which work to address the incidents of domes-
tic terror that are increasing across the coun-
try. 
According to the Anti-Defamation League, in 
2019, domestic extremists killed at least 42 
people in the United States in 17 separate in-
cidents. This number makes 2019 the sixth 
deadliest year on record for domestic extrem-
ist-related killings. Last year, a Trump Admin-
istration Department of Justice official wrote in 
a New York Times op-ed that ‘‘white suprem-
acy and far-right extremism are among the 
greatest domestic-security threats facing the 
United States.’’ Regrettably, over the past 25 
years, law enforcement, at both the Federal 
and State levels, has been slow to respond. 
It is not enough to just condemn hate; we 
need to equip law enforcement with the tools 
needed to identify threats and prevent violent 
acts of domestic terrorism. 
I am pleased that these two amendments 
are included in H.R. 7617 to help address this 
urgent need to keep Americans safe from 
these heinous acts of discrimination. 
The first, Amendment No. 137 allocates $1 
million to direct the FBI to track and report to 
Congress every year on extremist activity in 
law enforcement agencies. It is critical that our 
law enforcement agencies are held to the 
highest standards. My amendment allocates 
these funds for the FBI to combat white su-
premacist infiltration of the uniformed services 
and federal law enforcement. 
The second, Amendment No. 138, allocates 
$10 million in funds so that the FBI can assign 
a special agent or hate crimes liaison to each 
field office of the FBI to investigate hate crime 
incidents with a nexus to domestic terrorism, 
so that the agency has the resources in place 
to address this national issue. 
I thank the Committee for including both of 
these important amendments in En Bloc 2. 
The time is now to take the grave threat of 
domestic terrorism seriously. That means not 
only speaking out but giving our agencies the 
tools to combat it immediately. I believe these 
amendments are an important first step to ef-
fectively monitoring and putting a stop to ex-
tremist violence in America.

SPEECH OF 
HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
that this legislation includes important funding 
to support individuals, families, workers, small 
businesses and communities. I urge all Mem-
bers to support the following amendments that 
I have offered to H.R. 7617, the Defense, 
Commerce, Justice, Science, Energy and 
Water Development, Financial Services and 
General Government, Homeland Security, 
Labor, Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, Transportation, Housing, and Urban 
Development Appropriations Act, 2021 and I 
urge that they all be retained during further 
consideration of this measure. 
MANAGERS AMENDMENT TO H.R. 7617 
I want to thank Chairwoman LOWEY and 
Chairman QUIGLEY for including the text of the 
Garcia-Waters amendment in the manager’s 
amendment, which was adopted by the Rule. 
The Garcia amendment would direct the Sec-
retary of Treasury to negotiate a two-trillion- 
dollar allocation of Special Drawing Rights by 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Such 
an increase would have an immediate benefit 
to developing countries around the world by 
providing them with additional resources to ad-
dress the pandemic. This amendment comes 
at no cost to the Treasury and would dem-
onstrate our commitment to a global and co-
ordinated 
approach 
to 
addressing 
the 
coronavirus. 
Special Drawing Rights, or SDRs, are a re-
serve asset created by the IMF that are used 
to augment the international reserves of its 
members countries, and a new allocation 
would provide quick and much-needed assist-
ance to developing and emerging-market 
countries as they respond to the health and 
economic impacts of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
I do not share the concerns of some oppo-
nents of a new SDR allocation about the pos-
sible inflationary effect of such an allocation. 
An independent study at Harvard that closely 
examined this question concluded that any 
possible global inflationary impact of some in-
creased import demand by developing coun-
tries following an allocation of SDRs would 
likely be neutralized by the monetary policies 
of the Federal Reserve, the European Central 
Bank, and other inflation-targeting central 
banks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E716 
July 31, 2020 
If SDRs were issued on a regular basis, I 
think this issue would be a concern—but they 
are not. The last general and special SDR al-
location was issued in August 2009, and dur-
ing the six months that followed—which was 
an exceptionally difficult time for the world 
economy—less than 2 percent of the total 
SDR allocation was exchanged for usable cur-
rencies. Thirteen countries sold nearly their 
total allocation; three additional countries 
made partial sales. There was no inflationary 
impact. 
Importantly, the amendment also directs the 
Secretary of the Treasury to begin immediate 
efforts to reach an agreement with the G–20 
group of nations to extend through the end of 
2021 the current moratorium on debt service 
payments owed by the world’s poorest coun-
tries to more advanced economies. This in-
cludes China, which is by far the largest offi-
cial bilateral creditor to developing countries. 
WATERS AMENDMENT NO. 215 TO H.R. 7617 
On July 22, 2020, the SEC dealt a blow to 
investor protection and to the American peo-
ple, when it adopted amendments to proxy 
voting rules which, among other things, in-
creased issuer involvement in the advice that 
proxy advisors give to their clients. Waters 
Amendment No. 215 would prohibit the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 
using funds appropriated under this Act to im-
plement, administer, or enforce this newly- 
adopted final rule because the rule harms 
shareholder voting rights and undermines the 
independence of advice provided to share-
holders. 
Proxy advisory firms play an important role 
in providing research and advice to share-
holders regarding matters facing the compa-
nies they are investing in, and inform investors 
about the best way to vote in annual meet-
ings. Thus, the integrity of that advice man-
dates that it be provided free of company 
management’s conflicted input and unwar-
ranted interference. Also, the regulations on 
proxy advisory firms, as adopted, may drive 
up costs for investors and make it more dif-
ficult for them to cast informed votes. The rule 
will also reduce the already-tight reporting win-
dow for providing reports to investors. And, 
perhaps most importantly, the SEC’s mis-
guided rule may tilt voting advice more favor-
ably towards management. My amendment 
would prohibit the SEC from using funds ap-
propriated under this Act to implement, admin-
ister, or enforce the newly-adopted final rule 
and will prevent the resulting harm. 
This latest attack on shareholder rights is 
only compounded by the SEC’s proposed 
changes to the shareholder proposal rule, that 
would make it more difficult for shareholders 
to offer and resubmit proposals for broad 
shareholder consideration. I appreciate that 
H.R. 7617 includes language to prevent the 
SEC from using funding to implement, admin-
ister, or enforce these proposed changes to 
the shareholder proposal rule. 
WATERS AMENDMENT NO. 216 TO H.R. 7617 
This amendment relates to ensuring that 
$68.4 million of the $273.5 million appro-
priated to the Community Development Finan-
cial Institutions (CDFI) Fund are reserved for 
technical and financial assistance awards to 
minority Community Development Financial In-
stitutions (CDFIs), including minority deposi-
tory institutions (MDIs), and that the Fund re-
port to Congress on the implementation of 
such allocation. This amount represents 40 
percent of the $1 71 million of funding made 
available for financial and technical assistance 
awards for all certified CDFIs. 
We have learned in this pandemic how that 
minority-owned and minority-led financial insti-
tutions are critical to delivering access to cap-
ital to communities of color, the same commu-
nities that have been disproportionately and 
hardest hit. Unfortunately, following passage 
of the CARES Act, I quickly saw the problems 
with the Administration’s efforts to roll out the 
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Not only 
did the program set unreasonable barriers for 
CDFIs 
to 
participate, 
the 
Administration 
seemed to look the other way as the big 
banks turned away truly small businesses and 
minority-owned businesses, and instead pro-
vided concierge services to large companies 
that are publicly traded with ample financial re-
sources. 
When Congress began work on a second 
round of PPP funds, I worked with Speaker 
PELOSI and Small Business Committee Chair-
woman NYDIA VELA´ZQUEZ to ensure CDFIs 
would be able to access funds. We pushed for 
and successfully secured a $60 billion set 
aside in the law for community lenders, includ-
ing CDFIs and MDIs, to ensure they could de-
ploy PPP funds to small businesses and mi-
nority-owned businesses in their communities. 
I also worked with Secretary Mnuchin to elimi-
nate barriers so that more CDFIs could partici-
pate. These actions have produced results— 
CDFIs and MDIs have provided more than 
213,000 PPP loans to small businesses, in-
cluding many minority-owned businesses, to-
taling more than $16.1 billion as of July 24, 
2020. We have also included additional provi-
sions in the Heroes Act—which the Senate 
should pass without further delay—to ensure 
CDFIs have a chance to help truly small busi-
nesses and minority-owned businesses in their 
communities during this pandemic. This in-
cluded an emergency $1 billion appropriation 
to the CDFI Fund. 
I am pleased the underlying appropriations 
bill provides more resources than last year to 
the CDFI Fund, though we should ensure a 
portion of these funds go to minority-owned 
and minority-led CDFIs, including MDIs, to en-
sure these funds reach underserved areas. 
Unfortunately, the CDFI Fund does not track 
the demographics of who owns or runs the fi-
nancial institutions receiving financial and 
technical assistance awards through its pri-
mary program. This amendment encourages 
the CDFI Fund to begin doing so, and to set 
aside funds to ensure MDIs and other minor-
ity-led CDFIs receive funds to support cus-
tomers and small businesses desperate for a 
lifeline during these difficult times. 
WATERS AMENDMENT NO. 339 TO H.R. 7617 
This amendment would extend a deadline 
for housing counselors to meet a new certifi-
cation requirement. In August of 2017, HUD 
began implementation of a new housing coun-
selor certification requirement in which hous-
ing counselors had 36-months to pass a new 
certification examination. However, due in part 
to HUD’s administrative delays that were ex-
acerbated by the closure of certification exam-
ination testing sites as a result of the pan-
demic, we are now less than a week away 
from the certification deadline, and less than 
half of nearly 4,000 housing counselors are 
currently certified. HUD has requested the au-
thority to extend this deadline to ensure that 
the availability of housing counseling services 
is not suddenly and dramatically reduced. 
During the Great Recession, housing coun-
seling services were a lifeline for more than 2 
million homeowners. An evaluation conducted 
by the Urban Institute found that, when com-
pared to homeowners who did not receive 
housing counseling services, counseled home-
owners were three times more likely to secure 
loan modifications, received reduce mortgage 
payments, and were 70 percent more likely to 
remain current on their mortgages. 
The current crisis is no different. Every day 
we are hearing from housing counselors 
across the country that homeowners and rent-
ers continue to lack vital in-language and cul-
turally sensitive information about their rights 
under the CARES Act, do not understand 
what forbearance is or whether it is the right 
option for them, are unaware of local rent and 
mortgage relief funds, and continue to be mis-
led by mortgage servicers about their rights 
under federal law. This signals a potential in-
flux of households who would benefit greatly 
from credit counseling and other housing 
counseling services that are crucial to help 
manage their financial health and mitigate 
long-term harm during the pandemic. 
At a time when millions of families are faced 
with the threat of foreclosure and eviction, 
damaged credit, and depleted savings, my 
amendment ensures homeowners and renters 
are not harmed by a lack of availability of 
housing counseling services during and after 
the COVID–19 pandemic. The ability of these 
families to stay housed and the economic 
health of the nation depend on it. 
WATERS AMENDMENT NO. 150 TO H.R. 7617 
Under this amendment, no funds may be 
used to contravene the duties and responsibil-
ities of United States attorneys. In what was, 
tragically, just the latest example of the Attor-
ney General interfering with the duties of a 
federal prosecutor, the United States Attorney 
for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey 
Berman, was forced out of office on June 20, 
2020. Mr. Berman later revealed that the At-
torney General repeatedly urged him to resign, 
a startling and suspicious revelation consid-
ering that Mr. Berman, in his capacity as U.S. 
Attorney for S.D.N.Y, was investigating a 
plethora of cases related to the Trump Admin-
istration, including charges against associates 
of Rudy Giuliani, investigations of Mr. Giuliani 
himself, and investigations into the finances of 
the Trump inaugural committee. This firing ap-
pears to be another example of the Attorney 
General using Department of Justice funds to 
benefit the president politically or personally. 
My amendment would make clear that such 
use of taxpayer dollars is utterly unacceptable 
and prohibited. 
WATERS-SCHAKOWSKY-DINGELL AMENDMENT NO. 302 TO 
H.R. 7617 
This amendment is designed to protect resi-
dents of nursing homes. The amendment pro-
hibits the use of funds to finalize, implement, 
or enforce the Trump Administration’s July 
2019 proposed nursing home rule, which 
deregulates nursing homes and weakens in-
fection prevention standards in them. This 
amendment is cosponsored by Congress-
woman JAN
SCHAKOWSKY, who introduced 
H.R. 6698, the Quality Care for Nursing Home 
Residents and Workers during COVID–19 Act, 
and Congresswoman DEBBIE DINGELL. Nursing 
home residents have been hit especially se-
verely by the COVID–19 pandemic, and this is 
certainly no time to weaken the infection con-
trol standards that protect these vulnerable 
citizens.

WATERS-WATSON COLEMAN AMENDMENT NO. 303 TO H.R. 
7617 
This amendment prohibits the use of funds 
to require hospitals, hospital laboratories, and 
acute care facilities to report COVID–19 data 
using 
the 
‘‘teletracking.protect.hhs.gov’’ 
website that was announced by the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services in the 
document entitled ‘‘COVID–19 Guidance for 
Hospital Reporting and FAQs for Hospitals, 
Hospital Laboratory, and Acute Care Facility 
Data Reporting Updated July 10, 2020’’. This 
guidance update requires a data reporting 
process that circumvents the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) by order-
ing hospitals, hospital laboratories, and acute 
care facilities to send COVID–19 patient data 
directly to a database managed by Tele-
Tracking, a private health data firm, and built 
by Palantir, the data mining company owned 
and operated by mega-Trump donor Peter 
Thiel. Sending COVID–19 data to a private

WATERS-B. LEE-CHU AMENDMENT NO. 304 TO H.R. 7617 
This amendment increases by $5 million the

Secretary designated for the Minority AIDS Ini-
tiative. It is cosponsored by Congresswoman 
BARBARA LEE, the Co-Chair of the Congres-
sional HIV/AIDS Caucus, and Congress-
woman JUDY CHU. As a long-time leader on 
HIV/AIDS issues, I established the Minority 
AIDS Initiative in 1998, working with the Clin-
ton Administration and the Congressional 
Black Caucus, and I know how important this 
program is for minority communities that con-
tinue to be severely and disproportionately im-
pacted by HIV/AIDS. These additional funds 
will allow the Minority AIDS Initiative to provide 
HIV/AIDS prevention, screening, and treat-
ment services to additional people in affected 
minority communities. 
WATERS-C. SMITH AMENDMENT NO. 305 TO H.R. 7617 
As the Co-Chair of the Congressional Task 
Force on Alzheimer’s Disease, I offered 
Amendment No. 305 to increase by $5 million 
the funds for the BOLD Infrastructure for Alz-
heimer’s Act. This bipartisan amendment is 
cosponsored by Congressman CHRISTOPHER 
H. SMITH, the Republican Co-Chair of the Con-
gressional Task Force on Alzheimer’s Dis-
ease. This amendment increases funds for 
BOLD from $14.5 million to $19.5 million, 
bringing the account close to the authorized 
level of $20 million, in order to jump start the 
development of a public health infrastructure 
for Alzheimer’s patients, their families, and 
their caregivers. 
WATERS-SCHAKOWSKY AMENDMENT NO. 306 TO H.R. 
7617 
This amendment increases by $5 million the 
funds for the Alliance for Innovation on Mater-
nal Health (AIM) within the Maternal and Child 
Health account of the Health Resources and 
Services Administration (HRSA). The amend-
ment is cosponsored by Congresswoman JAN 
SCHAKOWSKY. The AIM program assists state- 
based teams to improve the quality and safety 
of maternity care with the goal of reducing ma-
ternal mortality and improving maternal health. 
According to HRSA, the rate of pregnancy-re-
lated deaths in the U.S. has more than dou-
bled since 1987, and non-Hispanic Black and 
American Indian/Alaskan Native women are 
significantly more likely to die from pregnancy 
related 
causes 
than 
non-Hispanic 
White 
women. An increase in funds for AIM will help 
improve maternal health and enable more 
pregnant women to safely deliver their babies. 
CONCLUSION 
I want to thank the Rules Committee for 
making in order each of these amendments, 
and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘Yes’’ on 
each of these amendments.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO CHIEF ROB-
ERT KNOX ON THE OCCASION OF 
HIS RETIREMENT AS THE CHIEF 
OF ZIONSVILLE POLICE DEPART-
MENT 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 31, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Robert Knox on the occa-
sion of his retirement as the Chief of the 
Zionsville Police Department. Chief Knox has 
spent the last thirty-five years serving and pro-
tecting the people of Zionsville, including the 
last nine as Chief of Police. For the entirety of 
his career, Chief Knox was dedicated to his 
true calling as a public servant, rising through 
the ranks of the police department. The peo-
ple of Zionsville and Indiana’s Fifth Congres-
sional District are forever grateful for Chief 
Knox’s commitment to the law and the protec-
tion of the City of Zionsville. 
Robert Knox grew up on the west side of 
Boone County where he attended Western 
Boone High School. Upon his graduation, 
Robert attended Vincennes University where 
he completed a four-year apprenticeship as a 
pipe fitter. During this time, Robert became a 
reserve officer for the Zionsville Police Depart-
ment following in the footsteps of his father 
Darrel who was a military police officer. This 
is when he says he discovered his true calling 
as a police officer. Following his discovery, in 
1982, Robert was offered a full-time job with 
the Lebanon Police Department. He graduated 
from the Law Enforcement Academy and on 
September 
15, 
1984, 
then 
returned 
to 
Zionsville to begin his career as a Zionsville 
Police Officer. 
Robert fell in love with the community he 
was serving, getting to know the people and 
becoming a well-known community figure. His 
friends and colleagues know how adamant he 
is about getting out of his patrol car and get-
ting to know the people he served and pro-
tected. Through the years, Robert rose 
through the ranks within the department. After 
his start as a patrolman, he advanced to de-
tective, detective sergeant, detective lieutenant 
and captain in charge of the Criminal Inves-
tigations Division. During his time with inves-
tigations, Robert spent time assisting the 
Metro Drug Task Force, the Boone County 
Homicide Task Force and the Hamilton Boone 
County Joint Task Force. In 2011, after spend-
ing years serving and protecting the people of 
Zionsville, Robert was promoted to his role as 
Chief of Police. 
As the chief of police, Robert continued his 
dedication to community engagement through 
programs such as ‘‘Coffee with a Cop,’’ the 
Teen and Citizens academies, the Drug Take 
Back program and more outreach programs all 
aimed at building a strong relationship with the 
community. Chief Knox had many successes 
during his tenure as the chief of ZPD, includ-
ing adjusting to a growing city. As the popu-
lation increased, Chief Knox adjusted to the 
growth by adding officers and reinstating the 
department’s K–9 unit. When Chief Knox was 
sworn in, the department had 25 full time em-
ployees and today the department has 38 full 
time officers, a 50% increase. Chief Knox’s 
tenure also including partnering with Zionsville 
Community Schools to establish the School 
Resource Officer Initiative. 
Chief Knox made a remarkable impact on 
his community and the lives of his friends, 
family and colleagues. He has truly left a leg-
acy of success in the community of Zionsville 
arid in the Fifth District of Indiana that will be 
built upon for years to come. On behalf of the 
City of Zionsville and the Fifth District of Indi-
ana, I congratulate Chief Robert Knox on his 
extraordinary career and I extend my gratitude 
for all the wonderful contributions he made to 
our community. I wish the very best for Chief 
Knox and his entire family in whatever en-
deavor he takes on next.

Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Missouri’s first responders who 
work selflessly to keep our communities safe. 
I am tremendously proud and grateful for the 
Police Officers, Firefighters, and Emergency 
Medical Professionals who leave their own 
families and put themselves in harm’s way to 
take care of others. Emergency Dispatchers 
communicate with terrified victims, frantic wit-
nesses, worried family members and suicidal 
citizens. They are a calming influence for ev-
eryone who calls . . . the reassuring, com-
petent voices in the night that offer peace, as-
sistance, and comfort. 
On any given day, first responders may be 
called to rescue someone from a burning 
building, break-up a vicious assault, settle a 
family dispute, or simply help a grandparent 
who has fallen. No matter what the situation 
demands . . . bravery, diplomacy, initiative, 
versatility or compassion . . . they provide ex-
actly what is needed in that moment. 
Just like during tornados and floods, first re-
sponders are on the frontlines of today’s 
COVID–19 crisis and they are being put in sit-
uations that were unfathomable just a few 
months ago. EMS workers are struggling to 
keep up with a dramatic increase in 9–1–1 
calls while enduring shortages of protective 
equipment and frequent exposure to the virus. 
Police departments are fighting to keep the 
peace when large numbers of their workforce 
are in quarantine and morale is challenged by 
anti-police rhetoric dominating the national dis-
course. Fire departments are often under-
staffed, especially in rural areas, but that 
doesn’t stop them from working tirelessly to 
keep communities safe amid volunteer short-
ages. And, emergency dispatchers don’t have 
the option to work from home . . . they are 
managing an increase in call volume while 
working in close quarters, which prevents so-
cial distancing. 
Missouri’s first responders embody the very 
best of the American spirit. With charity and

compassion, these brave men and women 
regularly put the well-being of others before 
their own. Through their actions they are he-
roes . . . through their example they are role 
models for all of us to emulate. 
Madam Speaker, the current COVID–19 
pandemic has presented Missouri’s first re-
sponders with seemingly impossible chal-
lenges. Despite numerous obstacles, police of-
ficers, firefighters, emergency medical profes-
sionals and 9–1–1 dispatchers are showing up 
every day to care for their friends, neighbors, 
and communities. On behalf of a grateful com-
munity, I express my sincere thanks, and pray 
God blesses them all with peace and safety.

FIREFIGHTER EXCESS PERSONAL 
PROPERTY IN H.R. 6395, THE NA-
TIONAL 
DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT OF 2021 
HON. KIM SCHRIER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 31, 2020 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased that my amendment to assess the 
Firefighter Property Program (FFP) and the 
Federal Excess Personal Property Program 
(FEPP) implementation and best practices 
was included in final passage of H.R. 6395, 
the National Defense Authorization Act of 
2021. 
I would also like to include in the RECORD a 
letter of support for my amendment from the 
National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC). 
The Department of Defense (DOD) Fire-
fighter Property Program (FFP) and the Fed-
eral 
Excess 
Personal 
Property 
Program 
(FEPP) transfer excess equipment like hoses, 
trucks, and aircraft and vehicle parts to the 
U.S. Forest Service to be distributed to states. 
As the National Volunteer Fire Council notes, 
‘‘many of the fire departments that take advan-
tage of FFP and FEPP are located in rural 
areas that have relatively small tax bases and 
therefore lack the resources to afford new 
specialized equipment and vehicles to respond 
to 
wildland 
fires 
and 
other 
unique 
vulnerabilities in the communities that they 
serve.’’ 
The FFP and FEPP programs currently offer 
excess equipment on a first-come, first-served 
basis. As the nation is facing increasing 
threats of extreme fire events, states are not 
acquiring equipment in an equitable manner. 
This is due to a multitude of factors. My 
amendment requests an assessment of FFP 
and FEPP implementation and best practices, 
taking into account community need and risk, 
including whether a community is an at-risk 
community. 
It additionally requires consultation with 
state implementers and program recipients 
which will allow us to understand how these 
programs are operating on-the-ground, and 
more importantly, how we can improve access 
for volunteer and small fire and emergency 
service providers in rural communities. 
I am thankful to have the National Volunteer 
Fire Council’s support for this amendment. I 
want to emphasize their request that the agen-
cies carrying out the assessment required by 
this amendment ‘‘establish a process for vol-
unteer fire departments and state and national 
organizations representing the interests of vol-
unteer fire departments to provide input into 
the assessment as part of consulting with ‘par-
ticipants in the programs.’ ’’ 
As the FY2021 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act moves to conference, I ask that my 
colleagues work to include this important 
amendment in the final bill. 
NATIONAL VOLUNTEER FIRE COUNCIL, 
Greenbelt, MD, July 22, 2020. 
Hon. KIM SCHRIER, MD, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE SCHRIER: On behalf 
of the National Volunteer Fire Council 
(NVFC), which represents the interests of 
the nation’s volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue 
services, I am writing regarding your amend-
ment to the National Defense Authorization 
Act of 2020 directing the Department of De-
fense (DoD), acting through the Director of 
the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), jointly 
with the Secretary of Agriculture, acting 
through the Chief of the Forest Service, to 
assess the Firefighter Property Program 
(FFP) and the Federal Excess Personal Prop-
erty Program (FEPP). 
As you know, the FFP and FEPP programs 
provide critical assistance to thousands of 
volunteer fire departments across the coun-
try each year by allowing them to acquire 
excess DoD property, including equipment 
and vehicles. Many of the fire departments 
that take advantage of FFP and FEPP are 
located in rural areas that have relatively 
small tax bases and therefore lack the re-
sources to afford new specialized equipment 
and vehicles to respond to wildland fires and 
other unique vulnerabilities in the commu-
nities that they serve. These programs are 
extremely important to the volunteer fire 
service and I thank you for your interest in 
developing an assessment to evaluate ways 
that they can be improved. 
One issue that I hope can be examined as 
part of the assessment is the extent to which 
additional resources could increase access to 
and participation in the FEPP and FFP pro-
grams by volunteer fire departments. Based 
on anecdotal evidence from our members I 
believe that more assistance devoted to help-
ing process applications to acquire surplus 
property and transport surplus property 
from where it is stored to the fire depart-
ment requesting it would make it easier for 
some agencies to take full advantage of 
these programs. 
I am pleased that your amendment explic-
itly directs the agencies carrying out the as-
sessment to ‘‘. . . consult with State for-
esters and participants in the programs . . .’’ 
State foresters play an important role in fa-
cilitating the acquisition of surplus property 
by fire departments in their states. Addition-
ally, differences in state statutes authorizing 
fire department participation in the FEPP 
and FFP programs contribute to some of the 
variations we can observe in acquisition 
rates between states. All of these are impor-
tant issues to be examined in the assess-
ment. I would also encourage the Committee 
to direct the agencies carrying out the as-
sessment to establish a process for volunteer 
fire departments and state and national or-
ganizations representing the interests of vol-
unteer fire departments to provide input into 
the assessment as part of consulting with 
‘‘participants in the programs.’’ 
Finally, I question the central role that 
DoD and DLA would play in developing the 
assessment under the amendment language. 
As you know, while DoD/DLA along with the 
General Services Administration are respon-
sible for managing and disposing of a vast 
array of excess federal property, none of 
those agencies has anything to do with the 
management or administration of the FEPP 
or FFP programs, specifically. I encourage 
the Committee to clarify that each agency 
tasked with carrying out the assessment 
focus on aspects of the programs that are ap-
propriate given the scope of their actual role 
in administering the programs. 
Thank you for your support for the FEPP 
and FFP programs, as well as the volunteer 
fire service generally. If you have any ques-
tions please feel free to contact me. 
Sincerely, 
RON ROY,

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT, 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposi-
tion to the appropriations bill before us today. 
The bill we are debating is as partisan a bill 
as I have seen in my years on the appropria-
tions committee. Not only does the package 
spend billions over the current bipartisan 
budget agreement, the bill also contains many 
policy items that have no place in an appro-
priations bill. 
Despite ongoing negotiations for a new 
coronavirus relief package this bill adds an-
other 24 billion dollars in coronavirus relief 
funding . . . this is in addition to the 3 trillion 
in supplemental funds that were passed in 
May and adding more funding beyond what 
was outlined in the Senate’s HEALS Act. 
This may seem like a worthy cause if we 
knew the bills were going to be signed by the 
President in the coming days, but that’s not 
the case. Instead, we are sitting here wasting 
time and energy inserting these provisions that 
guarantee the bill will never be signed into law 
as is. 
This bill contains seriously dangerous provi-
sions that place our men and women in uni-
form in harm’s way by repealing the AUMF’s 
that guide our counterterrorism operations, it 
ties the president’s hands with regard to Iran, 
and undercuts America’s dominance of space 
and our ability to counter nations like China 
who want to gain supremacy there. Further, it 
eliminates several long-standing, bipartisan 
Second Amendment protections while also 
defunding the police and targeting law en-
forcement through overreaching regulations. 
The amendments that have been made in 
order by the rule undercut our military leader-
ship even further by making exemptions to 
policies put in place to preserve good order 
and discipline, turning our military into a social 
experiment instead of maintaining our readi-
ness and capability as the world’s preeminent 
fighting force. 
Despite the inclusion of South Mississippi’s 
priorities in this bill, such as ship and boat 
building in Pascagoula and Gulfport, rocket 
propulsion testing for Stennis Space Center, 
and many other coastal priorities, this bill fails 
to deliver what’s necessary. 
At a time where America is suffering, the 
country is in turmoil, and we are working to re-
gain our footing as the world’s top economy, 
this bill does more harm than good.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF PIH HEALTH DOW-
NEY HOSPITAL 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 31, 2020 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize PIH Health Downey 
Hospital on its upcoming 100th anniversary. 
On September 14, 2020, the hospital will 
proudly celebrate and reflect on the 100 years 
of service and care that its facilities and its 
staff have provided. Through the years, the 
hospital has been a cornerstone of the Dow-
ney community, caring for generations of local 
residents. 
From its beginnings as Virginia Hospital in 
1920, with six beds and two doctors in rooms 
on the second floor of a former hotel on what 
is now Downey Avenue, this hospital’s history 
has been eventful and full of advances. Within 
two years of its opening, an explosion in the 
city made the hospital’s value clear and 
showed the need for larger facilities. Two 
years later, a new 15-bed hospital opened on 
East 5th Street. 
In the 1930s, a group of five physicians pur-
chased the hospital and renamed it Downey 
Community Hospital (DCH). Growth before 
and after World War II added operating rooms, 
modern X-ray equipment, maternity and ob-
stetrics wards, and an emergency department 
with round-the-clock care. By 1956, the same 
year the city of Downey became incorporated, 
DCH reorganized as a nonprofit hospital with 
49 beds. 
In the mid-1960s, construction began on a 
new 152-bed facility at the current location on 
Brookshire Avenue. The day after this facility 
opened in 1969, eight surgeries were per-
formed. Within a week, the hospital was full. 
Over the subsequent decades, DCH contin-
ued to grow its facilities, resources, and serv-
ices to meet the health care needs of the 
growing community. In 1999, Downey Com-
munity Hospital became Downey Regional 
Medical Center (DRMC), a total health care 
system that included a 199-bed hospital and 
DRMC Insurance Services. Downey Regional 
Medical Plaza opened in 2003. 
In 2013, a Management Services Agree-
ment signed between DRMC and PIH Health 
created an opportunity for greater collabora-
tion between the two mission-based nonprofit 
organizations. Downey Regional Medical Cen-
ter, with the approval of the California Attorney 
General’s office, became part of the PIH 
Health family as PIH Health Hospital—Downey 
on October 1, 2013. The hospital was re-
named PIH Health Downey Hospital in 2019. 
This new partnership has been crucial to 
meeting 
Southern 
Californians’ 
expanding 
health care needs. 
Over the last century, PIH Health Downey 
Hospital has changed and evolved, but it has 
always been driven by a mission to provide 
the best care for its patients and our commu-
nities and making enhancements and updates 
to achieve this goal. It is now the second hos-
pital of a vastly growing health system that 
services more than three million people. 
As PIH Health Downey Hospital looks to the 
future, the hospital and its staff remain com-
mitted to honoring a legacy of healing and 
hope. By prioritizing the needs of its patients 
and dedicating itself to meeting their needs 
and expectations for generations to come, the 
hospital will continue to have a positive impact 
in the community for the next 100 years and 
beyond. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
please join me in thanking and congratulating 
PIH Health Downey Hospital, and its more 
than 5,100 compassionate and valued staff, 
on the hospital’s celebration of 100 years pro-
viding high-quality health care, and contrib-
uting to the health and well-being of our com-
munities in an ethical, safe, and fiscally pru-
dent manner.
