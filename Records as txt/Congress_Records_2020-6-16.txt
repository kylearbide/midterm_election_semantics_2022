Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JUNE 16, 2020 
No. 111 
House of Representatives 
The House was not in session today. Its next meeting will be held on Thursday, June 18, 2020, at 10 a.m. 
Senate 
TUESDAY, JUNE 16, 2020 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, have mercy upon this 
land we love. We place our total trust 
in You to do for us what we can’t do for 
ourselves. You have delivered us in the 
past. You have not failed us. Our faith 
is in You. Lord, inspire our Senators to 
know that You are still on your throne, 
working for the good of those who love 
You. Listen to our prayers, and give us 
wisdom, courage, and integrity that 
will enable us to glorify You. 
We pray in Your wonderful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
too often, Americans are cynical about 
our political system when all they see 
is legislative gridlock. Yet Iowans were 
able to set themselves apart by work-
ing together on law enforcement re-
forms in the wake of George Floyd’s 
murder. 
Every step of the way, the Iowa proc-
ess was fueled by input from the grass-
roots, 
including 
those 
who 
dem-
onstrated peacefully. The Republican- 
led statehouse and senate partnered 
with the Democrats to unanimously 
pass reforms in our State—some of 
them historic reforms. Governor Rey-
nolds signed House File 2647 to bring 
additional accountability to Iowa’s law 
enforcement officers. 
These are some of the things that 
they did: created stronger restrictions 
on the use of choke holds by law en-
forcement officers; improved the law 
enforcement decertification process to 
ensure that those who have been fired 
or who resign after serious misconduct 
do not work in our State; strengthened 
the authority of the Iowa attorney gen-
eral to prosecute officers whose actions 
result in the death of another; estab-
lished annual anti-bias and deescala-
tion training requirements for officers. 
We are working on some of these 
very same policies here on the Federal 
level. Washington should follow Iowa’s 
example and pass legislation to help 
correct wrongs and inspire positive 
change in our communities across the 
country. Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM will 
be leading hearings today on this issue 
before the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Hopefully, we can act. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
NOMINATION OF JUSTIN REED 
WALKER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this week, like most weeks for a month 
and a half now, has brought a study in 
contrasts to the U.S. Capitol. Over in 
the 
Democratic-led 
House 
of 
Rep-
resentatives, the lights are off. The 
doors are locked. There is nobody 
home. 
With our country facing a once-in-a- 
century pandemic, a historic economic 
disruption, a major discussion of racial 
justice, and all of the other important 
business we were already set to tackle 
this year before all of this, the Speaker 
of the House has mostly kept her 
Chamber on the longest running spring 
break in human history—lots of talk 
about 
supposed 
priorities 
but 
few 
votes; lots of partisan attacks leveled 
at the Republicans from a distance but 
little action. Over here in the Senate, 
the story has been very different. We 
are holding hearings. We are legis-
lating. We are confirming nominees. 
With precautions, we are manning our 
posts for the country. 
Tomorrow, the Senate will begin con-
sidering the President’s nomination of 
Judge Justin Walker to fill a vacancy 
on the DC Circuit—the second most im-
portant Federal bench in the country. 
As my fellow Kentuckians and I can 
attest, Judge Walker is exactly the 
kind of individual our country deserves

to have in such a role. He graduated 
from Duke summa cum laude and then 
from Harvard Law magna cum laude. 
He clerked on the DC Circuit himself 
for an impressive young judge named 
Brett Kavanaugh and then on the Su-
preme Court. 
He has built a national reputation as 
a leading academic scholar of the law. 
It is no wonder that even the ABA 
rates him ‘‘well qualified.’’ He has 
quickly made a name for himself as a 
district judge. 
A few weeks ago, when the mayor of 
Louisville tried to cancel drive-in 
Easter services with disparate restric-
tions that did not apply equally to 
other parking lots, Judge Walker won 
national attention for his eloquent de-
fense of religious liberty. This subject 
becomes more important by the day. 
The American people deserve to have 
strong respect for their First Amend-
ment rights, including their rights of 
religious exercise and conscience, on 
one of our country’s highest courts. So 
I look forward to continuing to detail 
our Kentucky pride for Judge Walker 
as this week unfolds, and I will take 
great pride in voting to advance his 
nomination and to confirm him. 
f 
GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the Senate will first pass the Great 
American Outdoors Act. It will be a big 
step in the history of our Nation’s pub-
lic lands and great news for their fu-
ture. 
This bill is the product of a lot of 
hard work by many of our colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle. It has two 
clear purposes: It will restore access 
and function to parks and facilities 
that have been neglected, and it will 
secure a stable flow of resources to sup-
port recreation and conservation well 
into the future. 
I have detailed in recent days just 
how many Americans rely on our Na-
tion’s public lands—from the guides 
and outfitters who cater to the boom-
ing outdoor recreation economy; to the 
hotel workers, restaurant owners, and 
gateway communities that welcome 
hundreds of millions of annual visitors; 
to the researchers who study historic 
sites and unique habitats; to the hunt-
ers, anglers, sportsmen, and American 
families who explore millions of acres 
of open space. 
It is clear that a bright economic fu-
ture for America is intertwined with 
this precious resource, so backlogged 
maintenance and delayed upkeep are a 
real problem. Too often, tough budg-
etary choices have left important fa-
cilities worn down and natural treas-
ures inaccessible. I am proud that this 
legislation before us will tackle these 
critical missions, but you certainly 
don’t have to take my word for it; you 
can look to the list of no fewer than 60 
cosponsors on both sides of the aisle or 
to the 80 Senators who voted to ad-
vance consideration of the bill last 
week, or you could sample from the 
ringing endorsements of an impressive 
cross-section of American recreation 
and conservation advocates. 
Take, for example, the letter the 
Democratic leader and I received from 
the last six former Secretaries of the 
Interior. Men and women who served 
under Presidents of both parties came 
together to tell us that ‘‘the Great 
American Outdoors Act will help en-
sure a better, brighter future for na-
ture and for all of us.’’ 
Hundreds of advocacy organizations, 
from the Sierra Club to the American 
Sportfishing Association, also approve. 
They say the bill ‘‘will ensure that our 
parks and other public lands continue 
to preserve our nation’s heritage and 
recreation 
opportunities, 
and 
that 
local communities and economies . . . 
will continue to flourish.’’ 
It is not often that we are presented 
with the opportunity to take over-
whelmingly bipartisan action that will 
affect a monumental part of American 
life for so many years to come, and the 
opportunity in front of us this week 
comes thanks to the dedicated work of 
several of our colleagues. 
In particular, I would like to thank 
Senator DAINES and Senator GARDNER 
once again for their extraordinary 
leadership. I look forward to seeing 
their efforts across the finish line, and 
I urge all Members to join me in sup-
porting this bill and securing our nat-
ural wonders for generations of Ameri-
cans yet to come.

Revenue Code of 1986 to modernize and im-
prove the Internal Revenue Service, and for 
other purposes.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
BOSTOCK V. CLAYTON COUNTY, GEORGIA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled 
that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does, 
in fact, prohibit employment discrimi-
nation on the basis of sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity. It was a land-
mark decision that represents a step 
forward—a big step forward—on the 
long march to full equality for LGBTQ 
Americans. We salute that decision. 
That is what the Supreme Court should 
be doing—moving us in a direction of 
equality and fairness. All too often, it 
doesn’t these days. So this was a re-
freshing breath of fresh air from that 
Court. 
The march, of course, is not over. 
Yesterday’s decision, welcomed as it is, 
reminds us that, even today, even in 
2020, we have so much work left to do 
to advance the cause of justice and 
equality for all Americans. Only a few 
days ago, our laws didn’t clearly estab-
lish that you couldn’t be fired by your 
employer simply because of who you 
are and whom you love. Yesterday’s de-
cision is not the end of the fight. It was 
one step forward. If it is wrong to dis-
criminate against people because of 
whom they love and because of who 
they are and if it is wrong to discrimi-
nate against people on the basis of sex-
ual orientation and gender, isn’t it 
wrong on the job? If it is wrong to dis-
criminate against people on the basis 
of sexual orientation and gender on 
employment, isn’t it wrong on hous-
ing? Isn’t it wrong on so many other 
issues? 
That is why we need the Equality Act 
to pass. The decision is certainly not 
the end of the fight. Disparities and 
discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation and gender identity still 
exist in so many aspects of our lives— 
education, 
housing, 
credit, 
public 
spaces, services, and in many other 
ways. If it is wrong to discriminate 
against people because of their sexual 
orientation and gender on jobs and em-
ployment, it is equally wrong in these 
other areas like housing and education. 
We need to pass the Equality Act, 
which expands the prohibition of dis-
crimination to many other needed 
areas. 
Today, Senate Democrats will send a 
letter from our caucus to Leader 
MCCONNELL urging him to schedule the 
Equality Act for a vote on the floor. 
The House passed it a year ago. It has 
been languishing in MCCONNELL’s legis-
lative graveyard. I would say to my Re-
publican colleagues: If some of the 
most conservative people around, like 
Justice Gorsuch and Justice Roberts, 
can come to the conclusion that we 
should stop discriminating, where are 
you? The Senate Republicans only 
seem 30 years behind the times on this 
issue for sure. 
I urge the leader to put the Equality 
Act on the floor now, and let’s extend 
what the Supreme Court did in terms

of employment to so many needed 
other areas. Wake up, my Republican 
friends. The times, they are changing, 
and 
discrimination 
against 
LGBTQ 
Americans should be over once and for 
all and should be the law of the land in 
every aspect of our lives. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Madam President, now, on another 
issue where the Republican caucus 
seems to be behind, since the killing of 
George Floyd sparked nationwide pro-
tests, we have been pushing our col-
leagues in the Senate to respond to our 
national pain with collective action. 
This is a moment in American history 
where a great mass of our people are 
demanding change in the streets of our 
largest cities and smallest towns. Now 
is the moment to reach for real, last-
ing, strong, comprehensive change. We 
cannot merely make some changes 
around the margins. 
Democrats drafted and proposed com-
prehensive police reform legislation 
last Monday, the Justice in Policing 
Act, led by Senators Booker and Har-
ris. With 4 weeks to go in this current 
session, we have asked Leader MCCON-
NELL to commit to a vote on the Jus-
tice in Policing Act before July 4. We 
didn’t say: ‘‘Do our bill immediately.’’ 
We asked our Republican colleagues to 
commit to a debate on our bill before 
July 4—within the next 4 weeks—but so 
far we haven’t heard any indication 
from the Republican majority that we 
will take up comprehensive police re-
form this month. 
Last night, a member of the Repub-
lican leadership said a bill was un-
likely before July 4. Of course, Leader 
MCCONNELL has also reportedly told his 
caucus that the Senate was unlikely to 
do another COVID relief bill until after 
July 4. When it comes to urgent na-
tional priorities, the Republican ma-
jority is like a broken Magic 8–Ball 
that keeps saying: ‘‘Ask again later.’’ 
Peaceful protests have continued for 
3 weeks, and Republican Senators want 
to wait another month, maybe even 
longer, to consider reform on the floor 
of the Senate? The popular anger over 
long-simmering issues of police bru-
tality and racial justice has reached a 
tipping point. There is no reason to 
wait. There is no reason to delay. By 
delaying action, Senate Republicans 
are playing the same dangerous polit-
ical games that they played after mass 
shootings last summer. 
Why is it that, when it comes to con-
firming rightwing judges who want to 
roll back the clock on healthcare and 
on voting rights, Senate Republicans 
always make time, but when it comes 
to making real changes to police de-
partments, Senate Republicans are al-
ready making excuses? Democrats and 
the American people who overwhelm-
ingly support real meaningful change 
and accountability in our Nation’s po-
lice departments will not rest until we 
achieve comprehensive and bold re-
form. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, of course, we are 
also still waiting for the Republican 
Senate majority to propose anything 
related to COVID–19. Only a few weeks 
ago, Leader MCCONNELL said that an-
other coronavirus relief bill was likely 
during the June work period. Once 
again, in typical fashion of this Repub-
lican 
majority, 
the 
deadline 
has 
slipped, and now we have no time to 
consider another COVID bill before 
July 4, and this will have very real con-
sequences for the American economy. 
Leader MCCONNELL is willing to blow 
through his own deadlines, but some 
deadlines will arrive whether the Re-
publican leader likes it or not. Whether 
he likes it or not, his inaction is cre-
ating some very steep cliffs for our 
economy and for the American worker. 
Funding for the very popular and bi-
partisan Paycheck Protection Program 
will run out on June 30. State and local 
governments need to finalize their 
budgets by July 4, and many of them 
will be forced to cut back on critical 
public services without public support. 
The moratorium on evictions that we 
passed in the CARES Act expires on 
July 24. The emergency unemployment 
insurance we passed in the CARES Act 
expires on July 31, and K–12 schools 
need over $150 billion and as much time 
as possible to safely reopen this fall. 
So, Leader MCCONNELL and Repub-
licans, there are at least five cliffs and 
many more we face if we don’t act 
soon: the cliff of funding small busi-
ness, the cliff of helping State and 
local governments, the cliff on evic-
tions, the cliff on unemployment insur-
ance, and the cliff on the need for 
schools to reopen in September. 
Today, Leader MCCONNELL and I re-
ceived a letter signed by over 100 
economists and scholars, including two 
former Chairs of the Federal Reserve, 
three former Chairs of the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and two Nobel lau-
reates, urging Congress to pass another 
relief package commensurate with the 
$16 trillion hole in our economy caused 
by COVID–19. At a minimum, these dis-
tinguished economists wrote: The bill 
should include ‘‘continued support for 
the unemployed, new assistance to 
states and localities, investments in 
programs that preserve employer-em-
ployee relationships, and additional aid 
to stabilize aggregate demand.’’ 
It sounds a lot like the Heroes Act, 
which passed the House of Representa-
tives, but, once again, it is sitting in 
Leader MCCONNELL’s legislative grave-
yard. Economists from all walks of life 
are telling Senate Republicans to get 
off the mat and do something to help 
the economy before it is too late. Gov-
ernors from both political parties are 
pleading for aid. Even the Chair of the 
Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, appointed 
by President Trump, is sounding the 
alarm about the need for another emer-
gency relief bill. 
When will Senate Republicans finally 
get the message? When will they under-
stand that unless we do these things, 
the economy will decline in the future, 
and that millions who are unemployed, 
millions whose businesses are in jeop-
ardy, and millions who want to see 
schools open will not get what they 
need? We must act now. When will Re-
publicans in the Senate finally get the 
message? We need to act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, our 
economy has taken a huge hit from the 
coronavirus, and we have a lot of work 
to do to recover. There are encouraging 
signs, and one of those has been the 
success of the Paycheck Protection 
Program. 
The pandemic has presented a par-
ticular challenge for small businesses 
that frequently have very limited cash 
reserves to draw on. That is why, 
thanks to the efforts of Senators 
RUBIO, COLLINS, and others, Congress 
established the Paycheck Protection 
Program, which provides forgivable 
loans to small businesses to help them 
keep employees on their payroll during 
this crisis. 
So far, more than 4.5 million small 
businesses nationwide have received re-
lief from this program, and the major-
ity of the loans have gone to the small-
est businesses. Nearly 3 million of the 
4.5 million total loans have been at or 
under $50,000. In my home State of 
South Dakota, more than 21,000 busi-
nesses have benefited, including some 
of the many seasonal businesses that 
have a limited amount of time each 
year to make the money that they 
need to survive. 
I am very grateful to the thousands 
of bank and credit union employees 
around the Nation who processed these 
loans under challenging circumstances 
during the pandemic. All told, millions 
of small business jobs have been saved, 
and a lot of small businesses that 
might have gone under during the pan-
demic are hanging on thanks to this 
program. 
In fact, the Paycheck Protection 
Program is undoubtedly one of the 
main reasons that the May jobs num-
bers were not as bad as expected. In-
stead of net job loss, the economy actu-
ally gained jobs. 
Now, that is not to suggest that the 
May jobs report was rosy. Our unem-
ployment rate is unacceptably high, to 
put it mildly, but the fact that we 
gained jobs is a positive sign. It is defi-
nitely a step in the right direction, and 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
helped us get there. 
So far, Congress has provided $2.5 
trillion to respond to the coronavirus, 
including the almost $700 billion allo-
cated to the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. That is a staggering amount of 
money, equal to roughly half of the en-
tire Federal budget for 2020. These were 
extraordinary circumstances and ex-
traordinary action was required. 
However, Democrats are now pushing 
for Congress to rush another massive 
bill out the door. It is important to re-
member that every dollar Congress has 
provided to fight the coronavirus has 
been borrowed money. Now, as I said, it

is money that we needed to borrow, but 
it is still borrowed money that will 
have to be repaid. 
Will we need to provide more money 
to confront the pandemic and its ef-
fects? Probably. But we need to make 
sure that we are only appropriating 
what is really necessary. Rushing a $3 
trillion 
bill 
through 
Congress, 
as 
Democrats want to do, before the $2.4 
trillion we have already provided has 
even been fully spent is not a respon-
sible way to go about providing addi-
tional relief. What we need to focus on 
right now is monitoring the implemen-
tation of coronavirus funding so we can 
identify where we have spent suffi-
ciently and where we may need to do 
more. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
provides a good example of the strat-
egy that we should be using. Congress 
provided nearly $350 billion for the 
Paycheck Protection Program when it 
was first created. Within a short time, 
after the program’s kickoff, however, it 
became clear that demand was so great 
that we would need to provide addi-
tional funding, and that is what we did. 
We provided an additional $310 billion 
in late April. 
Then, just a couple of weeks ago, we 
passed another update to the pro-
gram—not additional funding but a 
package of fixes to provide additional 
flexibility to small businesses. 
I have proposed a further refinement 
to the program that I hope Congress 
will pass in the near future. 
While the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram is open to self-employed work-
ers—which describes many farmers—in 
practice, the program’s guidelines have 
excluded a lot of agricultural pro-
ducers. 
Low commodity prices and a chal-
lenging planting season meant that 
many farmers and ranchers had a nega-
tive net income in 2019. And right now, 
the program’s guidelines exclude farm-
ers or ranchers without employees with 
a negative net income for last year. 
My legislation would allow more 
farmers to access the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program by allowing them to use 
their 2019 gross income instead of their 
2019 net income when calculating their 
loan award. This is what we should be 
doing when it comes to additional 
coronavirus funding. 
The best way to make sure that we 
are spending taxpayer dollars wisely 
and not burdening our economy with 
more debt is to carefully monitor the 
implementation of the funds we have 
already provided and use that informa-
tion to guide further action. That is 
what we have done with the Paycheck 
Protection Program, and that is what 
we 
should 
do 
with 
the 
other 
coronavirus funding we passed and the 
other coronavirus programs we imple-
mented. 
It is also important to remember 
that sometimes what is required is not 
additional money but other types of so-
lutions, like the fixes we passed that 
add more flexibility to the Paycheck 
Protection Program. 
As we move forward, I will continue 
to work with my colleagues to respond 
to the coronavirus, and I will continue 
to do everything I can to ensure that 
any additional money we spend is care-
fully targeted to the real needs, with 
an eye to minimizing the burden we are 
putting on future generations. We owe 
younger Americans nothing less. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there 
an urgent need for us to help America 
in this time of crisis? I think most peo-
ple would agree there is. As a result, 
the House of Representatives more 
than 6 weeks ago passed legislation to 
continue 
to 
provide 
assistance 
to 
Americans who are in need. Certainly, 
that would include those who are un-
employed. We created an unemploy-
ment Federal benefit of $600 a week 
over and above the State benefit, ex-
panded eligibility and the time the 
benefit would be awarded, and made it 
available across this country right at 
the moment when some 40 million 
Americans were announcing that they 
had lost their jobs, were unemployed. 
It was a helping hand that was long 
overdue and certainly made a dif-
ference in the lives of many families. 
I think it is responsible for the fact 
that we did see welcome news last 
week that some 2 million Americans 
have gone back to work. I hope that 
trend continues, but in the meantime, 
of the 20 million who are unemployed, 
this helping hand of $600 a week from 
the Federal Government is essential. It 
is not exactly a windfall when you cal-
culate it. The Federal benefit, plus 
State benefit really comes up close to 
the average wage of most Americans. It 
is not a major benefit that they can 
live off of for any long period of time— 
that is for sure—but it gets them 
through the crisis, we hope, in paying 
their rent, their mortgage, utility bills, 
and providing food and clothing for 
their family. 
Here is the problem: If you want to 
know if there is some urgency involved 
in unemployment insurance, consider 
the fact that on July 31, the program I 
have just described disappears. Do you 
think unemployment will disappear on 
July 31? We should be so lucky, but we 
know better. It is going to take a while 
for us to get back on our feet as a na-
tion. We have to stand by those who 
are unemployed in the meantime, until 
they can get back to work and provide 
for their families. 
Unfortunately, the program we cre-
ated ends July 31. Is there an urgent 
need to extend it in some form? I be-
lieve that is obvious to virtually every-
one. I can’t understand why Senator 
MCCONNELL, the Republican leader in 
the Senate, doesn’t feel this sense of 
urgency in his home State of Ken-
tucky, as I do in my home State of Illi-
nois, right across the river. We have 
common areas. Downstate Illinois and 
Kentucky are somewhat similar in 
their economies, and I know there are 
people who need a helping hand. 
I hope Senator MCCONNELL will con-
sider giving them that helping hand— 
but not just in this area. There is also 
included in the bill that passed the 
House of Representatives, the Heroes 
Act, an extension of COBRA benefits. 
What is COBRA? If you are working 
for a company that provides health in-
surance, you pay part of the premium, 
and they pay the other part. If you lose 
your job but want to continue that 
health insurance plan, under COBRA 
you can if you pay both sides, employer 
and employee, on the premium. The av-
erage cost is about $1,700 a month. It is 
a pretty hefty sum for anyone who just 
lost their job. 
Under the bill that passed the House 
of Representatives, there would be 100 
percent coverage of the employer’s por-
tion of the COBRA premium during the 
period of your unemployment. That is 
a helping hand, which most workers 
desperately need. I am sure they need 
it in the State of Kentucky, just as we 
do in the State of Illinois and all across 
the Nation. 
There is a sense of urgency if you 
don’t have health insurance, 
isn’t 
there? We are more conscious than ever 
about the need for good health insur-
ance. 
I 
would 
hope 
that 
Senator 
MCCONNELL would consider that when 
he decides whether there is an urgent 
need for us to pass the bill that was en-
acted by the House of Representatives. 
In addition, there is a major portion 
of the House bill that provides assist-
ance to State and local governments. 
We desperately need it across the Na-
tion. Hardly any State—county, major 
city, even cities of modest size—hasn’t 
seen the cost of government go up as 
government revenues from sales tax, 
for example, have diminished and the 
cost of government related to the 
COVID–19 crisis have increased. 
The helping hand to these State and 
local governments is consistent with 
what we did in the first bill, the 
CARES Act, and is desperately needed. 
What is the alternative? I know what it 
is, and most everyone does as well: 
There will be dramatic layoffs of State 
and local employees if we don’t provide 
a helping hand from the Federal Gov-
ernment. These employees include, of 
course, teachers, medical personnel, 
law enforcement, and the like. 
If we want to make certain that we 
maintain the basic protections of gov-
ernment at the State and local level, 
then Senator MCCONNELL should con-
sider supporting the bill that already 
passed the House of Representatives. 
There is one major stumbling block 
when it comes to this issue of Senator 
MCCONNELL taking up any measure to 
help our economy from this point for-
ward. It was 6 weeks ago, in April, 
when Senator MCCONNELL announced 
that he was drawing a redline that he 
wouldn’t budge from, and that redline 
said that we had to provide immunity 
from liability for businesses and others 
before he would even consider addi-
tional benefits for American businesses 
and families. We don’t know exactly

what the Senator had in mind. He an-
nounced on several occasions from the 
floor here that he wanted to put this 
immunity provision into any future 
package, but as of today, we still 
haven’t seen it. We are still waiting. 
One of his colleagues, Senator COR-
NYN from Texas and my colleague on 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, has 
given several speeches on the subject. 
There was one that he gave on May 19, 
which I would like to refer to because 
it is perhaps his longest statement and 
the longest Republican statement on 
just what they have in mind. Senator 
CORNYN said that there has been a wave 
of COVID–19-related lawsuits rolling in. 
He called it an avalanche of lawsuits. 
He went on to use other terms equally 
cataclysmic. He called it a litigation 
epidemic, a tidal wave of lawsuits. He 
went on to talk about those as creating 
a need for us to provide some protec-
tion against lawsuits. 
I decided to take a look at this ava-
lanche, this tidal wave that we heard 
about so much from Senator MCCON-
NELL and Senator CORNYN. You see, 
there is a law firm tracker service that 
takes a look at every lawsuit filed in 
America to see what they are all about. 
They have a category of lawsuits re-
lated to COVID–19, and they give reg-
ular reports on how many lawsuits are 
filed. 
Let’s take a look at the avalanche of 
lawsuits that have been filed as of yes-
terday. Remember, 2 million Ameri-
cans have been diagnosed with the 
COVID–19 infection—2 million. 
Out of 2 million Americans with 
COVID–19 infections and over 115,000 
deaths, as of yesterday, how many 
medical malpractice lawsuits do you 
think have been filed based on COVID– 
19 against healthcare workers, doctors, 
nurses? How many across the whole 
United States of America? Five. Five. 
Some avalanche. 
How many lawsuits have been filed 
by those who say that they are forced 
to work in unsafe working conditions 
because of COVID–19? In this tidal 
wave, there have been 49 of those law-
suits filed—49 across the entire United 
States. 
By way of comparison, how many 
lawsuits have been filed involving 
COVID-related disputes between busi-
nesses and insurance companies? Six 
hundred and thirty-one. 
Five hundred and sixteen lawsuits 
have been filed by prisoners because of 
what they have alleged to be unsafe 
living conditions related to COVID–19 
and 194 lawsuits challenging govern-
ments’ stay-at-home orders across the 
board. 
This doesn’t strike me as an ava-
lanche or a tidal wave or some spate of 
frivolous lawsuits being filed by work-
ers or customers. Part of the reason, 
you learn in your first year of law 
school. In tort law classes, one of the 
first things you are told is, before you 
can recover in a lawsuit, you have to 
prove causation. What was it that 
caused your injury? How is that de-
fendant responsible for your injury? It 
is a difficult thing to prove in many 
lawsuits and very difficult when it 
comes to an invisible virus as to what 
circumstances 
or 
what 
individual 
would be responsible for the fact that 
you became infected and are filing this 
lawsuit. Causation is hard. 
Here is what it really gets down to: I 
believe—and most people do—that if a 
business or an entity is really making 
a reasonable, good-faith effort to pro-
tect employees and customers, that 
should be a defense to any lawsuit. 
What would that consist of? We had a 
hearing in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee 3 weeks ago. The star witness 
on the Republican side was a very im-
pressive individual who represented the 
convenience stores of America. He was 
from the same State as Senator COR-
NYN, the State of Texas. His name is 
Mr. Smartt. He came in and told the 
story about many facilities that he had 
which were providing goods and serv-
ices to the people of Texas and how he 
was making a good-faith effort to pro-
tect those who work for him and those 
who did business in his establishment. 
He talked about plastic shields. He 
talked about hand sanitizers. He talked 
about spacing and distancing. It was 
really clear from the start that this 
CEO of this major Texas corporation 
was doing his best to protect the people 
who came into his business and his 
workplace. 
I thought it was a good statement 
when, on page 7 of his testimony—and 
I will refer you to it if you would like 
to look at the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee testimony—he said that his big-
gest problem was he didn’t know what 
standard he had to live up to, what was 
the proper thing for him to do from a 
public health point of view. He didn’t 
know which way to turn. Was it the 
Centers for Disease Control? Was it the 
Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
ministration? Was it the State of 
Texas? Was it some Federal agency? He 
was really begging us: Give me a stand-
ard to live up to, and I will do my level 
best to live up to it. 
I don’t think that is an unreasonable 
position. I salute him. I would like to 
be, if necessary, in court defending 
him, saying: This is a man who is try-
ing his best in the business environ-
ment to be a responsible citizen, both 
for his workers and for his customers, 
but he doesn’t have a standard to oper-
ate by. 
Why don’t we have this Federal 
standard? Well, you point the finger of 
responsibility to the White House. 
President Trump and his administra-
tion have refused to come forward with 
enforceable and inspectable standards 
that we can use to take a look at those 
who are trying to protect others from 
public health exposures. Without that 
Federal standard, companies like that 
one in Texas really don’t know where 
to turn. If OSHA came up with a stand-
ard and said ‘‘This is what we expect in 
the workplace’’ and you lived up to 
that standard, I would say, as an attor-
ney who spent a lot of time in the 
courtroom, you have a pretty strong 
defense going for you—first, the issue 
of causation, and secondly, whether 
you have done what is reasonable on 
your part to protect people. 
That is what it comes down to. 
Democrats and others argue that we 
should hold businesses to a reasonable 
standard of responsibility. We cer-
tainly don’t encourage or defend frivo-
lous lawsuits. But we don’t want bad 
actors who are ignoring any reasonable 
standards or responsibility to get away 
with murder. They should be held re-
sponsible, and they should be reliable 
in terms of their own activity. That is 
what it comes down to. 
Senator MCCONNELL is holding back 
assistance for State and local govern-
ments, money for hospitals, money for 
the unemployed, because of the so- 
called redline when it comes to immu-
nity. Listen, it is human nature. If you 
say to businesses across the board 
‘‘You are immune from lawsuits,’’ I am 
afraid some people will take advantage 
of that. They will not even try. And 
people get sick as a result of it or 
maybe worse. We don’t want that to 
happen in this country. We want people 
to do the right thing—to protect them-
selves, their families, and to protect 
others, and in business, to make sure 
they are protecting the public at large. 
If they live up to a certain standard, I 
think they have a good defense to any 
lawsuit. 
But the so-called avalanche and tidal 
wave 
of 
lawsuits—5 
medical 
mal-
practice lawsuits after 2 million Amer-
icans have been infected by COVID–19— 
really tells the story. 
I would encourage the Republicans to 
finally produce and present to us the 
standard they want to make part of the 
law of the land. Let’s see what is in it. 
Let’s talk about it. And if you are will-
ing to establish reasonable standards 
based on public health to protect the 
public at large, I want to be at the 
table. We can find common ground. But 
if you are saying ‘‘We want immunity 
for these businesses. We want to let 
them off the hook no matter what they 
do, even if they do nothing,’’ I am 
sorry, that is worth a fight. We have to 
make sure that people across America 
have a reasonable expectation that 
when they enter a business or go to 
work, they are going to be in a safe en-
vironment, and that the people who 
employ them, the ones who want to do 
business with them, have lived up to 
that responsibility. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The

OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

S2986 
June 16, 2020 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, just 
over a week ago, Senator HARRIS and 
myself, with the partnership and sup-
port of many of the Democrats in the 
Senate and our Senate leadership, 
CHUCK SCHUMER, along with colleagues 
in the House, our Congressional Black 
Caucus, and over 250 partners through-
out the two Chambers, introduced the 
Justice in Policing Act, a bill designed 
to take concrete steps to bring long 
overdue, long called for, much needed, 
real accountability and transparency 
and oversight to policing in America. 
We introduced the bill in the wake of 
the killing of George Floyd by law en-
forcement 
officers 
in 
Minneapolis, 
along with what happened to Breonna 
Taylor in her home in Louisville, the 
killings of other Americans, names 
who are now known for the wretched, 
awful way in which they died: Eric 
Garner, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, 
and so many others. So many others 
whose names we do not know are all 
part of a system that does not reflect 
our common values and does not re-
flect the highest ideals of this Nation. 
In fact, it is just the opposite. It re-
flects the darkness of our past and our 
present. It reflects racism and bigotry 
and not equal justice under the law. 
We are at a point in American his-
tory that is at a crossroad, where mil-
lions of Americans in all 50 States are 
engaging in some type of action of pro-
test, whether it is on social media plat-
forms or in the middle of a pandemic 
out in the streets. The question we 
have right now before us in this body is 
this: In the face of Americans of all 
backgrounds, races, religions, and par-
ties who are calling for reform, what 
will this body do? 
A lot of folks want to reduce the ap-
proaches that are coming forward as a 
Republican or Democratic approach. I 
am telling you right now that this is 
not a choice between one side of the 
aisle or another. It is a choice between 
meaningful reforms in this moment or 
making symbolic gestures that will do 
nothing to save people’s lives. It is a 
choice between action and inaction. 
The bill we are proposing is not new. 
These are reforms that have been put 
in place in some cities and in some 
States. This is a real effort to hold po-
licing in America accountable for egre-
gious behavior. It will create trans-
parency, as sunlight is the best dis-
infectant to injustice. It will also bring 
about an end to policies and practices 
that should be ended in our country. 
They have been called for by President 
Bush in his first address to Congress 
for an end to racial and religious 
profiling. 
We see, in fact, as to some of the 
more, so-called, controversial elements 
of this bill, like qualified immunity, 
that conservatives and Democrats on 
both sides of the aisle—folks from the 
Cato Institute, Clarence Thomas, and 
you see conservative organization after 
conservative organization—say the ob-
vious, that no one should be shielded 
from accountability when they are vio-
lating the civil rights of another Amer-
ican. 
We have a bill that calls for change 
that will protect lives and address the 
practices that have killed Americans, 
create accountability and transparency 
in departments, and make sure that no 
one in our country is above the law. 
This is not a time for half steps and 
half measures. It is not a time to nib-
ble around the edges. It is not a time to 
find the lowest common denominator. 
It is not a time—when so many Ameri-
cans feel a metaphorical knee on the 
neck of justice—for us to pull our knee 
halfway off of that neck and call it 
progress. No, this is a time for us to do 
what is right and necessary to end the 
kind of violence and murder and 
unaccountability that we see and that 
is too endemic in our Nation. 
This is the truth. The measures in 
this bill will pass. Congress will one 
day get this right. I am confident that 
one day in this country the provisions 
in the Justice in Policing Act will ban 
religious and racial profiling. I am con-
fident that one day in this country we 
will ban choke holds. I am confident 
that one day in this country we will 
have a national registry of police mis-
conduct, of police use of force. I am 
confident that one day no one who 
murders someone in broad daylight in 
front of cameras will be shielded from 
accountability on the Federal level, in 
our civil courts, or in our criminal 
courts, by impossible standards to 
meet. It is clear that one day we shall 
overcome what is now injustice, that 
this body will do the right thing. 
There will be a time in America when 
mental health issues will be treated 
with healthcare and not police and 
prisons. There will be a time in Amer-
ica that addiction will be treated with 
treatment and not police and prisons. 
There will be a time in America that 
the fragile within our society will not 
be further hurt and harmed by prac-
tices and prisons but will be elevated 
and cared for. I know this time is com-
ing. But I believe that the time is now, 
that justice delayed is justice denied. If 
we do not act and claim this moment, 
this time, then we, as a country, are 
going to find ourselves here again. 
In my short life, I have seen decades 
of this. I was born right after the 
Kerner report calling out these prac-
tices and demanding reforms. In that 
time, I watched Rodney King get beat-
en and officers who did it be held unac-
countable for their actions. This cycle 
is continuing in our country every day. 
There are so many cases that we 
don’t see because we don’t have trans-
parency. They explode into the na-
tional consciousness when someone 
catches on videotape what we know is 
wrong but we have not taken the meas-
ures to stop it. Now is the time that we 
must act and not find ourselves here a 
month from now, a year from now, 3 
years from now, watching this awful 
cycle play over and over. 
Listen to the American people—all 50 
States, all backgrounds—joining to-
gether in a course of conviction to put 
a stop to this nightmare. Now is the 
time—no half measures, no half steps, 
no diluted attempts, no fainting to-
ward what should be done but not hav-
ing the courage to boldly go in the di-
rection that one day this bill will pass. 
But I believe ‘‘one day’’ should be 
today. Congress should act. 
I am so proud that I am not alone in 
this position. I am so proud that there 
are others in this body who are joining 
with me, with the same sense of ur-
gency to get broad-based reforms done. 
I see my colleague from Oregon, one 
of the many champions for justice in 
this body. I am grateful now to yield to 
him. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon is recognized. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
am honored today to join Senator 
BOOKER, Senator HARRIS, and so many 
of my colleagues to work to take this 
moment of national outcry and turn it 
into an opportunity, a moment of na-
tional action. 
For weeks now, in protests across our 
land, millions of fellow Americans have 
been rising up and speaking out to de-
mand justice, accountability, oppor-
tunity, and, above all, the equality 
promised by our Founders 244 years 
ago. 
This latest movement may have been 
sparked by the senseless killing of 
George Floyd, a Black man, at the 
hands of public safety officers. One of-
ficer, sworn to protect and defend him, 
knelt on his neck for 9 minutes, extin-
guishing his life. But this movement is 
about so much more. The pain and 
anger and the anguish that have burst 
forth from the hearts of Black Ameri-
cans everywhere run far deeper than a 
single tragedy. It is a pain born of an 
endless string of tragedies, the sense-
less 
killings 
of 
Breonna 
Taylor, 
Ahmaud Arbery, Eric Garner, Tamir 
Rice, Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray, Mi-
chael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and 
more—so many more Black men and 
women who should be alive today—of 
Rayshard Brooks, shot in the back by a 
police officer, who died this past Fri-
day night. It is a pain borne even be-
fore we were yet a country, when more 
than 400 years ago, traders kidnapped 
Africans from their own lands, brought 
them here to these shores—American 
shores—sold them, locked them into 
generations of brutal slavery, treated 
not as people but as property, chained, 
sold, whipped, raped, treated as some-
thing less than human. 
Our Nation has never come to terms 
with this legacy. There is no memorial 
on the National Mall. There is no 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 
So, 
still 
today, 
America’s 
gaping 
wound of racism bleeds pain and injus-
tice, 
and 
inequality 
continues 
to 
plague every system in our country. 
Too many Black men and women 
have lost their livelihoods, their lives, 
and their dignity to a justice system 
rigged against them: racial profiling, 
mandatory minimums, stop and frisk,

acts of racial profiling, and racially 
driven predatory actions. 
We entrust to our public safety offi-
cers vast power to serve their commu-
nities, but have we ensured that their 
vast power is exercised equally on be-
half of all citizens? We have not. 
Too 
often, 
forces—public 
safety 
forces, police forces—treat White citi-
zens as clients and Black citizens as a 
threat. That is systemic racism, and it 
must change. It is why I am so proud to 
stand here in support of Senator BOOK-
ER’s and Senator HARRIS’s sweeping 
Justice in Policing Act reform bill. We 
need to hold officers accountable for 
their actions. We need to change the 
culture of policing in America, and this 
legislation is the right law at the right 
moment to begin to do that. 
No one should ever be profiled based 
on the color of their skin. Choke holds, 
like the one that killed Eric Garner, 
must be a thing of the past. No-knock 
warrants, like the one that ended with 
Breonna Taylor being shot to death in 
her bed, should no longer exist. Under 
the Justice in Policing Act, these will 
be gone. 
When a public safety officer misuses 
the immense power of his or her badge, 
that misuse must be investigated, must 
be documented, must be penalized, and 
the record of that abuse must be pub-
lic. That is the essence of account-
ability that goes hand in hand with the 
responsibility and the power that goes 
with wearing the badge. 
Never again should an officer who 
has been fired for abusing their power 
be able to go down the road and be 
hired by another department and be 
able to continue abusive practices in a 
new setting. That is why I have advo-
cated for a national database of police 
misconduct, to achieve this outcome. 
And it is why I am so pleased that Sen-
ator BOOKER has included such a data-
base in the Justice in Policing Act. 
In 1968, the Kerner Commission, 
which was examining the source of the 
demonstrations the year before con-
cluded: 
‘‘Bad 
policing 
practices, 
a 
flawed justice system, unscrupulous 
consumer credit practices, poor or in-
adequate housing, high unemployment, 
voter suppression, and other culturally 
embedded forms of racial discrimina-
tion all converged to propel violent up-
heaval on the streets of African-Amer-
ican neighborhoods in Americans cit-
ies, north and south, east and west.’’ 
Doesn’t that sound familiar—all too fa-
miliar—here, 52 years later, half a cen-
tury later? 
One person testifying at the Commis-
sion said: I read the report of the 1919 
riot in Chicago, and it is as if I were 
reading the investigative report on the 
Harlem riot of 1935, the reporting of 
the investigating committee of the riot 
of 1943, the report of the McCone Com-
mission on the Watts riot. I must say 
in candor to members of this Commis-
sion, it is a kind of ‘‘Alice in Wonder-
land,’’ with the same moving picture 
shown over and over again, the same 
analysis, the same recommendations, 
and the same inaction. 
That is why I am standing on the 
floor in support of this act, because in-
action is not acceptable. Let the same 
not be said about this moment years 
from now. 
Today is a moment for a day of ac-
tion, for greater investments in afford-
able housing and decent communities 
and in schools and teachers in minority 
communities, for greater investments 
in Black business owners and early 
education programs like Head Start. It 
is a time to ensure that every Amer-
ican truly has a right to vote and is 
free from voter suppression and voter 
intimidation. 
This Friday, our Nation will, once 
again, 
recognize 
and 
celebrate 
Juneteenth, the day when slavery offi-
cially ended in this country 155 years 
ago. Let this Juneteenth stand as a day 
for all of us to reflect on the calls for 
justice crying out across our land. Now 
is a time to be agents of change—yes, 
to listen to the voices of the people, to 
join with those who have taken to the 
streets, enduring rubber bullets and 
the batons and the tear gas, to stand 
up for what is right. Now is a moment 
to stand shoulder to shoulder with our 
fellow Americans who have had enough 
of the suffering of inequality and of in-
justice, so together we can help our Na-
tion live up to the ideal of a land where 
everyone, no matter the color of their 
skin, is treated with the dignity and 
the respect and the opportunity and 
the equality equal to all others. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia is recognized. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, on 
Saturday, I attended a rally for justice 
sponsored by two young women—one, a 
high-schooler 
and 
one 
a 
middle- 
schooler—in my hometown. The rally 
was one of numerous marches and ral-
lies that have occurred every day, 
sometimes multiple times a day, in 
Richmond in the weeks after the hor-
rific public murder of George Floyd. 
Hundreds of people gathered in the 
Maggie L. Walker Plaza, a plaza named 
after a pioneering African-American 
woman, a business and civil rights 
leader. 
They gathered in the plaza to hear 
from our city’s young people. Many 
raised their hands when they were 
asked if they were graduates of this 
class of 2020, a class whose senior year 
was upended in mid-March and who 
face a future that, frankly, seems very, 
very frightening to many of them. 
I attended to listen. I used to be the 
mayor and Governor—now a Senator— 
but I attended as a neighbor to listen. 
I wasn’t on the program, and I didn’t 
ask to speak. I wanted to hear how our 
young people view this moment in time 
and what they are asking of us. 
What I heard in many different ways, 
from speeches and artistic perform-
ances, was no more politics as usual; 
no more police killings of people of 
color; no more empty promises of re-
form after each new policing outrage; 
no 
more 
education 
system 
that 
downplays the reality of injustice in 
this country since its birth; no more 
educational 
content 
that 
also 
downplays the contributions of African 
Americans, Indians, Latinos, and oth-
ers to our Nation; no more veneration 
of the Confederacy in Richmond, in 
Virginia, or anywhere else in the 
United States. 
This gathering, this rally, had a lot 
of police there. The police were there 
trying to keep the crowd from spilling 
from the plaza onto the busy Broad 
Street, where they would have been en-
dangered by passing vehicles. Some of 
the attendees of the rally advocated to 
defund the police, but others disagreed. 
Some asserted ‘‘all cops are bad,’’ but 
others disagreed. The rally was robust, 
it was raw, it was diverse, and it was 
respectful. It was the epitome—the ab-
solute epitome—of peacefully assem-
bling to petition government for re-
dress of grievances contemplated by 
the First Amendment. 
Just as my young activists urged in 
many different ways to end politics as 
usual, I desperately want to end apathy 
as usual. Apathy of the citizenry is a 
chief guarantor of politics as usual. In 
the tremendous energy demonstrated 
by 
these 
Richmonders 
and 
dem-
onstrated on the streets of commu-
nities all over this country, I am start-
ing to be hopeful about the end of apa-
thy as usual. These young people, they 
want action and results, and they de-
serve it. That is why I am proud to join 
Senators BOOKER, HARRIS, and many 
others in supporting the Justice in Po-
licing Act of 2020. 
We need to ban choke holds. We need 
to ban no-knock warrants. We need to 
ban racial and religious profiling. We 
need to hold police officers and police 
departments accountable for violent, 
reckless behavior. We need to promote 
better training and professional ac-
creditation of police departments. Why 
do we demand that universities main-
tain accreditation to receive Federal 
funds but make no such demand of law 
enforcement agencies? 
We need to do much more within the 
criminal justice system—but also with-
in all of our systems—to dismantle the 
structures of racism that our Federal, 
State, and local governments carefully 
erected and maintained over centuries. 
We know a little bit about this in 
Virginia. The first African Americans 
to the English Colonies came to Point 
Comfort, VA, in 1619. They were slaves. 
They had been captured against their 
will, but they landed in Colonies that 
didn’t have slavery. There were no laws 
about slavery in the Colonies at that 
time. 
The United States didn’t inherit slav-
ery from anybody. We created it. It got 
created by the Virginia General Assem-
bly and the legislatures of other 
States. It got created by the court sys-
tems in Colonial America in the sense 
that it enforced fugitive slave laws. 
We created it. We created it and 
maintained it over centuries. In my 
lifetime, we have finally stopped some 
of those practices, but we have never

gone back to undo it. Stopping racist 
practices at year 350 of 400 years but 
then taking no effort to dismantle 
them is not the same as truly com-
bating racism. 
I am mindful of the challenge laid 
down by our young people: no more 
politics as usual. 
It is one thing to introduce a bill. We 
do that all the time here. So often the 
introduction of the bill is all that oc-
curs—no committee hearing, no com-
mittee markup, no committee vote, no 
floor debate, no floor vote, no signa-
ture by a President—merely words on a 
page and a 1-day story and then, pos-
sibly, a blame game about who was at 
fault for nothing happening. 
That has been my biggest disappoint-
ment in 71⁄2 years in the Senate. Unlike 
my service at the State and local lev-
els, where we took action and then en-
gaged in healthy competition about 
who should get credit, in Congress, it is 
too often a story of inaction and then 
an unproductive competition over who 
should be blamed for nothing getting 
done: politics as usual. 
I pray that the engaged activism of 
our citizens has brought us to a new 
moment that will compel us to act in 
ways, large and small, in accord with 
the equality ideal that we profess to 
believe. 
This bill is a test of our resolve, and 
I urge my colleagues to meet the mo-
ment so that we can look our young 
people in their faces and tell them that 
we truly heard them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, it 
was 2015, shortly after the death of 
Freddie Gray in police custody in Bal-
timore, that I was in Sand Town, the 
community in which Freddie Gray 
grew up, meeting with community 
leaders, many of whom I had known for 
many, many years. 
We had an honest discussion about 
how policing in Baltimore had un-
folded. I was surprised to hear that 
these community leaders who wanted 
safety in their community felt that 
they could not confide with the police 
because they did not want people from 
their communities subjected to the dis-
criminatory policing of the Baltimore 
City police force. 
I had another meeting during that 
time with a group of African-American 
families. Everyone told me the story 
about how they feared particularly 
when their young African-American 
sons went into the community because 
of the fear that they would be discrimi-
nated against and hurt by the police. 
That fear was real. 
As a result of the Freddie Gray trag-
edy, we requested a pattern-and-prac-
tice investigation by the Department 
of Justice, and what was discovered 
during that investigation was that the 
policies of the Baltimore City Police 
Department’s zero tolerance to crack 
down on crime were used to profile the 
African-American community. In many 
cases, the police presence in the com-
munity provoked the violence and 
added to the harm of the people in the 
community. 
I wanted to take this opportunity to 
thank Senator BOOKER
and Senator 
HARRIS for putting together a bill that 
we need to take up on the floor of the 
Senate as quickly as possible: the Jus-
tice in Policing Act. It contains many 
provisions that, quite frankly, should 
have been enacted well before now. 
The tragic deaths of George Floyd 
and Rayshard Brooks just underscore 
the importance for us to act now. We 
need to debate these issues, and we 
need to pass legislation. 
I am grateful for Senator BOOKER in-
cluding two provisions that I had filed 
as legislation in several Congresses. 
One is the End Racial and Religious 
Profiling Act, a bill I filed a while ago. 
I think many of us remember the 
Trayvon Martin tragic loss, profiled be-
cause of the color of his skin. Racial or 
religious profiling targets a class of 
Americans for discriminatory treat-
ment. It is not when you have indi-
vidual information about a specific 
crime and indicators; it is when you 
target a community for special treat-
ment. 
It is wrong. It is wrong because it is 
against the values of America of equal-
ity and justice. It is wrong because it 
wastes resources which are so valuable 
to keep our communities safe. It is 
wrong because it turns communities 
against police. If we are going to have 
effective law enforcement, the commu-
nity and police need to work together, 
not at odds. It is wrong because it be-
comes deadly. Too many innocent peo-
ple have lost their lives because of dis-
criminatory profiling. It is time for 
this practice to end in America. 
I want to applaud the Obama admin-
istration because they took action at 
the Federal law enforcement level to 
make racial profiling illegal, but it 
still takes place in local law enforce-
ment. The legislation included in the 
Justice in Policing Act would make 
that illegal. It would prohibit it, and it 
provides for ways to enforce, to make 
sure that police departments comply 
with it. 
It also provides for training so law 
enforcement understands what racial 
profiling is all about. It also provides 
for us to get the data so we know ex-
actly what is happening at all levels of 
policing, whether State, local, or auxil-
iary. 
The Leadership Conference on Civil 
and Human Rights testified on the 
issue of discriminatory profiling last 
week, and I want to share some of the 
testimony of Vanita Gupta. She testi-
fied: 
The equal treatment of all people, regard-
less of background, class, or characteristic, 
protects and preserves public safety and 
builds legitimacy in police. Discriminatory 
policing, which targets people of color more 
often than others, has serious consequences 
not only for individuals and communities 
but also for law enforcement and society, by 
fostering distrust in law enforcement. . . . 
Through policy, training, and practice, law 
enforcement agencies can work to prevent 
and hold officers accountable for discrimina-
tory policing, and reduce and mitigate its 
disparate impact on marginal communities. 
I want to thank her for her testi-
mony, and I want to thank Senator 
BOOKER for including those provisions 
that would end this practice in the Jus-
tice in Policing Act. 
There is a second bill that I have in-
troduced for several Congresses: the 
Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity 
Act. It provides for performance-based 
standards for police officers. It em-
braces accreditation standards based 
upon President Obama’s Task Force on 
21st Century Policing. It does provide 
for training and oversight and proper 
investigations for those police officers 
who have crossed the line. It enhanced 
the pattern-and-practice discrimina-
tion cases so that consent decrees can 
be effective in ending these wrong 
practices. 
I am pleased that these two provi-
sions are included in the Justice in Po-
licing Act, as well as so many other 
important changes for reform and ac-
countability in law enforcement: the 
no-knock warrants, the standard that 
we hold officers accountable who have 
lost the trust of the American people, 
the registry so that law enforcement 
can 
know 
by 
background 
checks 
whether particular applicants 
have 
been involved in instances in other ju-
risdictions. 
All these are very, very important 
provisions that we need to act on and 
we need to act on now. Let us work to-
gether to guarantee equal justice under 
law and fulfill the promise of our Con-
stitution in order to form a more per-
fect union, establish justice, and en-
sure domestic tranquility. 
Let this Nation finally guarantee 
equal justice under the law. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, be-
fore the good Senator from Illinois 
speaks, I just want to, if I may, express 
my gratitude to the two colleagues 
who just spoke. The Senator from Vir-
ginia, who has been a champion on 
these issues when he was a Governor 
and now as a U.S. Senator, has been in 
the Senate much longer than I have. I 
have a lot of love for the history that 
he knows of his own State and the fact 
that he knows that that history of in-
justice has to be confronted. 
My mom did sit-in events in Char-
lottesville, VA, when she lived in DC, 
where I was born, and she went out to 
help integrate lunch counters in his 
great State. The fact that he is on this 
bill and he is a leader on these issues is 
extraordinary to me at this important 
time—and doing it in such a unifying 
way. I am grateful for that. 
I wanted to just say to the Senator 
from Maryland, I am newer to the Sen-
ate, and he has components of his bill 
that, after challenges in Baltimore 
with Freddie Gray, he helped to lead 
and write. It is not a partisan thing 
that he is calling for. There have been

June 16, 2020 
many Republicans who have come out 
and say this idea that you will profile 
people because of their race or religion 
is anathema to the very ideals of the 
Constitution. It is so obvious on its 
face. 
I have seen polling where upwards of 
90 percent of Republicans agree that we 
should not have people profiled based 
upon their race or religion, and that is 
one of the ideals of this bill, if you look 
at the common views of this; yet he 
has been fighting for this for years. I 
am grateful to have him as a part of it. 
I just want to say, as an introduc-
tion, on the Senate floor and for the 
record, to Senator DURBIN, who has 
been a partner of mine on criminal jus-
tice reform: This whole system of po-
licing and prisons and jails which has 
swept up millions of Americans and 
their families and their children is des-
picable, that we are the land of the free 
and incarcerate so many people. 
His work on crack cocaine/powder co-
caine disparities before I even came to 
the Senate has helped to lead to the 
liberation of so many African Ameri-
cans, so I am grateful that he, too, is 
on this bill. 
With that, I yield to the Senator 
from Illinois. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip is recognized. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
thank the Senator from New Jersey. 
During the course of one of his polit-
ical campaigns, Abraham Lincoln’s op-
ponent said to him: You have switched 
your position. You have reversed your 
position on an issue. You have changed 
on an issue. 
Abraham Lincoln said: It is true. You 
see, I would rather be right some of the 
time than wrong all of the time. 
Well, I learned that lesson, as many 
of us have who have served in Congress, 
when you vote for a measure and, 
many years later, have to reflect on 
whether it was the right vote. I voted 
for something called the War on Drugs. 
It seemed like a sensible thing to do, 
and many joined me: Black and White 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives. It was after the death of Len 
Bias, the Maryland basketball star who 
overdosed. 
In the moment of panic over crack 
cocaine, we did something which was 
going to just make a very clear public 
statement. The penalty for crack co-
caine was going to be 100 times the 
penalty for powder cocaine—100 times. 
We were going to let America know: 
Don’t mess with crack cocaine. 
What a colossal failure it turned out 
to be. The price of crack cocaine on the 
street went down instead of up; the 
number of users on the street went up 
instead of down; and we filled the pris-
ons of America, over the next 10 years, 
to a level we had never seen before, pri-
marily with African Americans who 
had been convicted of possessing and 
selling crack cocaine. 
I realized, as I am sure many others 
did too, that it was a big mistake. It 
was an experiment that failed at the 
expense of many people and their fami-
lies and their lives. So 10 years ago, I 
started out to try to change it. The 100- 
to-1 standard, in my mind, was indefen-
sible. It didn’t work, No. 1. No. 2, there 
was no scientific evidence that crack 
cocaine was that much more dangerous 
than powder cocaine. 
So I set out to make it 1 to 1, where 
it should be. I ran into an adversary by 
the name of Senator Sessions from Ala-
bama. He didn’t like the idea very 
much of my change. After long nego-
tiations, we agreed to drop the stand-
ard to 18 to 1. I can’t tell you the wis-
dom behind the number 18, but it was a 
compromised number. 
It changed a lot of things. Thousands 
of people in prison were able to leave 
early, and many had their sentences re-
duced. But it wasn’t enough. We needed 
to go further. It was clear, when it 
came to mandatory minimums and 
‘‘Three Strikes, You’re Out’’ and all of 
the things that led to imprisonments— 
which were almost impossible to de-
scribe—we needed another bill. 
I joined with Senator MIKE LEE, a 
very conservative Republican in the 
Senate, and we moved forward with the 
legislation. Others joined us as well, 
but we were stopped by one man who 
happened to be the chairman of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, CHUCK 
GRASSLEY. Senator GRASSLEY said: I 
don’t like this bill. 
He came to the floor many times and 
gave speeches against the bill. So it be-
came obvious to me, if anything was 
going to happen, I needed to win over 
CHUCK GRASSLEY. So I sat down with 
him and—literally for 1 whole year— 
negotiated changes in the bill, things 
that I didn’t want to give up but were 
part of the process to move us forward. 
We came up with the FIRST STEP 
Act, and he, proudly, was the lead 
sponsor on it, and I was his cosponsor— 
happy to be. Then we found an ally in 
the White House, Jared Kushner, who 
is open about the fact that his father 
spent time in prison and who believed 
in reform. 
We put together the FIRST STEP 
Act. One of the first people I went to 
was CORY BOOKER, then a new Senator 
from New Jersey, and said: I want you 
to support this bill. Read it, and tell 
me if you can. 
He came back to me with several pro-
posals. One of them was the incarcer-
ation of juveniles that you wanted to 
make sure would be changed in Amer-
ica—and several other worthy sugges-
tions we incorporated in the bill. And 
he became part of the team. The team 
was ultimately successful when, to the 
surprise of everyone in Washington, 
President Trump signed the FIRST 
STEP Act into law. 
So those who are skeptical that what 
we are about here cannot result in leg-
islation have ignored the obvious— 
something that occurred in the last 
year or two with this White House, 
with this President, and with a Repub-
lican majority in the Senate. We did 
something significant, and we can do it 
again, and we should. 
What we are talking about now with 
Justice in Policing is so obvious to the 
world. What has brought us to this 
point of this debate? I think two things 
have brought us here, and maybe we 
didn’t see it coming: videotapes and 
DNA. That is what brought us here. It 
is no longer speculation as to what 
happened in a parking lot. It is no 
longer conjecture as to what happened 
at the side of a curb in Minneapolis. We 
see it. We see it, and we can’t get the 
images out of our mind. 
A knee on the neck for 8 minutes 46 
seconds. Just in case that sounds like a 
short period of time, try kneeling, as 
Senator KAINE did in our moment of si-
lence in the auditorium just a few 
weeks ago. Try imagining someone’s 
knee on your neck for 8 minutes 46 sec-
onds. George Floyd lost his life in that 
period of time. 
I think the image that sticks with 
me is not only that man on the ground 
begging for his life but the image of the 
policeman who was being implored and 
begged by all the people around: Take 
your knee off. Let him breathe. And he 
just looked with those cold, hard eyes 
as he took the life out of that man. 
That image is something I will carry 
for the rest of my service in life, as are 
the images from the Wendy’s parking 
lot in Atlanta, GA. 
All of these things have brought us to 
the moment where we realize some-
thing must be done. 
I listened, Senator KAINE, when he 
talked about the rally he attended in 
Richmond over the weekend. What a 
coincidence that he would talk about 
the young people who organized it. In 
my home State, I have been to several 
rallies in the city of Chicago held by 
leaders in the community, religious 
and otherwise, but the meetings that I 
attended that had the most impact on 
me have been organized by high school 
students. 
In my hometown of Springfield, 
Nykeyla Henderson is a junior in high 
school. She is a tall young woman, 
kind of rangy, and doesn’t look like the 
type of person who would ever speak up 
for anything. But she and her twin sis-
ter, Nykia, decided to put together a 
rally at the State capitol 2 weeks ago 
in Springfield. Fifteen hundred people 
showed up. No windows were broken. 
No curses were thrown around. Nobody 
was throwing anything. They made it 
clear that it was going to be a peaceful 
rally and all about Black Lives Matter. 
I told her later that it is an amazing 
achievement at her stage in life that 
she were able to do this. How unusual 
it was that a young woman—a young 
African-American 
woman—took 
on 
this role of leadership with others. 
This 
last 
Sunday, 
I 
went 
to 
Jerseyville, IL. I was telling Senator 
BOOKER about this. I don’t know if 
there are many, if any, Black families 
in Jersey County. I represented this 
area for a long time, and I don’t re-
member any. They had a rally on the 
lawn next to the courthouse at 4 p.m., 
Sunday afternoon. I went down there

because of another African-American 
high 
school 
young 
woman 
named 
Lay’Lhany Davis. Lay’Lhany goes to 
high school about 20 miles away in 
Alden. She called for a Black Lives 
Matter rally in Jersey and asked if I 
would come. I said I wouldn’t miss it. 
She had done the same thing in 
Edwardsville, 
another 
small 
town. 
They had a rally, and when they start-
ed cruising with banners supporting po-
litical candidates and all the derision 
they were throwing at her, she said to 
these people: We are not going to be 
like that. We are not going to do that. 
This is going to be peaceful. 
I respect her very much for it. 
Here are these two 16-, 17-year-old 
young African-American women who 
are true leaders and inspiring in their 
humility. They are not looking for a 
headline. They wouldn’t know what to 
do with it. They are wide-eyed at the 
number of people who are showing up. 
The people who show up, by and large, 
are young people. White, Black, Brown 
people come there begging for freedom 
and liberty and hoping that we can do 
something in Washington. And why 
shouldn’t we? The reason we ran for 
these offices is to address the issues of 
the day in our time, to take on the 
tough chores of finding compromise 
when it looks like it is impossible. I 
think we can do this, and I know that 
we must. 
I want to recount one other thing be-
fore I yield the floor. I see others arriv-
ing here. It was 10 days ago when I 
asked the African-American members 
of my staff to get on a conference call. 
We spend a lot of time on conference 
calls. There were quite a few on the 
call, and I started talking about their 
experiences. They were a little reluc-
tant to volunteer much. Then the dam 
broke, and one of them said something 
that led another one to say something. 
It turned out to be one of the best con-
versations I have ever had with my 
staff. They told me some things that I 
needed to hear because listening is 
sometimes more important for a Sen-
ator than speaking, although I do a lot 
of speaking. 
I can recall so many of them de-
scribed for me the very first time—and 
they remember it, and they remember 
who said it—they were called the N- 
word. They remember it. Each went 
through that experience on the play-
ground or in a school. I am thinking to 
myself that I never had an experience 
in my life that was that profound that 
I remember it to this moment of some-
one using a word against me. 
Another young woman talked about 
the fact her mother sat her down at a 
young age and said: Listen to me. 
When you go to the store to buy some-
thing, always ask for a receipt. Always 
ask for a receipt. You put that receipt 
in that bag because somebody is going 
to stop you at the door and say you 
stole it, and you can show them you 
paid for it because you have the re-
ceipt. 
I thought, my mother never gave me 
that lesson. She never had to. I will 
never be stopped at the door. I am 
White. This young woman was Black. 
Time and again, the stories they told 
reminded me that the issue of racism is 
one we have faced in this country, as 
you said, for over 400 years—when slav-
ery came to our shores, before we were 
known as the United States of Amer-
ica, to this day. The greed and racism 
behind slavery still challenge us to this 
moment. 
Can we come up with an approach 
that is sensible? I hope we can. When 
you look at the history of Reconstruc-
tion, the Black codes, Jim Crow, the 
Great Migration, and everything that 
followed, you realize that we are still 
in the midst of this debate. We are as 
drawn to it as any moment in Amer-
ican history, and we have to face it and 
face it squarely and honestly. I think 
we can, and I think we must. 
Let me say one word about the anti- 
lynching law. I read about the history 
of the anti-lynching law in the U.S. 
Congress. I am sure Senator BOOKER 
knows it well. A Congressman from 
Missouri, Leonitis Dyer, was not Afri-
can American. He was a White Con-
gressman, a veteran of World War I, an 
attorney from St. Louis, and a former 
prosecutor who was outraged by the 
East St. Louis race riots. East St. 
Louis is my hometown, born and raised 
across the river. He was outraged by 
the race riots there and people killed. 
He introduced the anti-lynching laws. 
He got it through the House, and it 
came over here and died in the Senate. 
That measure has languished in this 
Chamber ever since. 
I thought to myself, lynching is a 
terrible, Southern phenomena. Boy, am 
I wrong. I did a little research and 
studied the history over the weekend. I 
was saddened to learn that in my home 
county, St. Clair County, on the Belle-
ville Square, an African American was 
lynched. Another African American 
was lynched in Decatur, IL, a town in 
Central Illinois I represented for years. 
Sadly, other lynchings took place in 
parts of Illinois that you might not 
have guessed. 
I learned the history of Anna, IL. I 
won’t say it on the floor because I 
don’t want to put it in the RECORD. Un-
fortunately, the name ‘‘Anna’’ has 
some racial connotations to it, which I 
will share privately with others. There 
was a lynching based on a person living 
in Anna who was lynched in Carroll, 
IL. This happened in the land of Lin-
coln. It happened in the North. It hap-
pened in my home State that I love. It 
is a reminder that hatred can be found 
everywhere. 
It is our job here with this bill to 
move forward and say to the good po-
lice: Thank you for serving us. Now 
join us in making sure we don’t have 
bad police. In your ranks, you know 
the people who cannot be trusted with 
their badge and gun to use them re-
sponsibly. You know the people who 
shouldn’t be policemen. Join us in 
making sure your ranks show real 
quality in the recruitment, in the 
training, and in the review of perform-
ance of all those who are serving in law 
enforcement. 
We need to do so much more. I am 
sure there is much more to be said. I 
want to thank my colleagues, Senators 
BOOKER and HARRIS, for bringing us to 
this moment. This is our moment. 
I beg TIM SCOTT, whom I dearly love 
as a colleague and a person, to join us 
in a bipartisan effort to do something 
historic at this moment. 
Don’t believe we can’t do it. Believe 
we can do the right thing that will 
stand the test of time. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to begin where my col-
league, the Senator from Illinois, left 
off, which is thanking Senator BOOKER, 
the Senator from New Jersey, Senator 
HARRIS, CBC, and the people protesting 
around this country for bringing us to 
this floor at this moment to demand 
urgent change. 
I am pleased to be joined by my col-
league from the State of Maryland, 
Senator CARDIN, from across the Poto-
mac River, Senator KAINE, and, of 
course, Senator DURBIN from Illinois. 
We are here because, like those mil-
lions of Americans taking to the 
streets around the country, we under-
stand that this is a moment when we 
must turn the pain into progress. We 
must transform the pain of George 
Floyd’s death and the unjust deaths of 
so many other Black Americans into 
deep and lasting change. We must bring 
the passionate pleas of the protesters 
across the Nation to the floor of the 
Senate to take action to root out sys-
temic racism in all its ugly forms. 
This is a deeply ingrained problem, 
and it is clear that tinkering around 
the edges is not enough. Systems em-
bedded with racism need to be over-
hauled. The State in the form of the 
police cannot be allowed to continue 
unjustly taking the lives and liberty of 
Black men and women. We must 
change the nature of policing. We need 
to change the culture. 
Here in the Senate, we must change 
laws to compel changes in culture. Let 
us remember that the police as an in-
stitution are a reflection of the greater 
society, and we have an obligation to 
change all those institutions where we 
find ingrained racist practices, every-
where we find it, since the Nation 
stood horrified by the video of George 
Floyd gasping for breath, crying out ‘‘I 
can’t breathe’’ as his life was snuffed 
out of him with a knee to his neck. 
Other Black men have senselessly 
died at the hands of police. 
By now, we probably have all seen 
the video of Rayshard Brooks. He fell 
asleep in his car after drinking. He was 
then interviewed by police for over 20 
minutes. If you haven’t watched that 
encounter, I urge you to do so because 
after that 20-minute conversation, he 
ended up dead with two bullets in his 
back. That encounter should never 
have ended that way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2991 
June 16, 2020 
Not far from here, in Woodstock, VA, 
we had another recent encounter that 
did not end in violence but exposed 
some of the racist assumptions that 
are too often wired into police re-
sponses and into societal responses. A 
Black pastor and Air Force veteran 
saw a man and woman disposing of an 
old refrigerator on his property. He 
told them to stop. The two were upset 
that the pastor would not let them 
dump this refrigerator on his property, 
and they grew irate. They went away, 
and they came back with three others. 
Then these five White people sur-
rounded the pastor, began jostling him, 
taunting him, calling him names, and 
saying they didn’t give a darn about 
his life and the Black Lives Matter 
stuff. 
In defense, he drew a gun, which he 
legally carried. He called 9–1-1 to get 
the police to come. The police did 
come. They arrested and handcuffed 
the Black pastor while the five White 
people continued to threaten him and 
wave as the police took him away. 
The sheriff in Woodstock has apolo-
gized, and the proper charges, includ-
ing hate crime charges, have been filed 
against those who trespassed and har-
assed the pastor, but that initial re-
sponse tells you what you need to 
know. 
Those are the kinds of encounters 
that Black men and women face every-
where in this country on a regular 
basis—North, South, East, and West. 
It reflects the same impulse of the 
woman in Central Park, NY, who was 
asked by a Black man and birdwatcher 
enthusiast to obey the law and leash 
her dog. Instead, she called the police 
on him to tell them that an African 
American was threatening her life. She 
was exploiting the fact that she would 
likely be believed. 
It is same ingrained and racist im-
pulses that resulted in five Black 
youth—now known as the exonerated 
five but who were locked up and spent 
years and years in prison after being 
falsely accused of a brutal assault in 
that same Central Park in New York. 
It is the same racist narrative of one 
of the first American films, ‘‘The Birth 
of a Nation,’’ showed by Woodrow Wil-
son in the White House. 
You can draw a straight line from 
slavery to Jim Crow, legal segregation, 
de facto segregation, and institutional-
ized racism to the deaths of George 
Floyd and so many other Black Ameri-
cans. 
Tinkering with the system will not 
be enough. Calling for more data and 
transparency is necessary, but it will 
not be enough. We have to take up and 
pass the Justice in Policing Act. 
I want to thank Senators BOOKER and 
HARRIS and the Congressional Black 
Caucus for leading this legislative ef-
fort. 
The Supreme Court yesterday had an 
opportunity to take up and change the 
doctrine of qualified immunity. They 
chose not to. Qualified immunity has 
allowed police and other State officials 
to act with impunity. There must be 
consequences for unjustly depriving 
citizens of life and liberty. The changes 
called for in the Justice in Policing Act 
are necessary to protect individuals, to 
protect communities, and to protect all 
those police officers who uphold their 
oath to protect the communities they 
serve. 
The police are the agents of the 
State. Holding police accountable and 
requiring justice in policing is just the 
first step. We must also confront the 
other manifestations of systemic rac-
ism and the institutions and societal 
norms that allow them to continue. We 
must dismantle them with the same 
deliberate actions that ingrain them in 
the first place. 
Tinkering with the system will not 
be enough. We need dramatic reforms 
in our criminal justice system. We 
have less than 5 percent of the world’s 
population but 20 percent of its prison 
population—something that the Sen-
ator from New Jersey has spoken about 
often, as have my colleagues. We need 
to change that. That is a stain on our 
country. We need to get rid of the pri-
vate prison system that gives some 
corporations a financial incentive to 
propagate a system that locks so many 
people up, but we need many other 
changes as well. 
We know that COVID–19 has dis-
proportionately killed people of color. 
We must address the underlying health 
disparities that lead to radically dif-
ferent outcomes for the Black commu-
nity from COVID–19 to maternal mor-
tality. 
President Trump celebrated the fact 
that the May unemployment rate was 
15 percent. That is nothing in and of 
itself to celebrate. It means millions 
and millions of Americans are out of 
work through no fault of their own. 
But he neglected to mention that the 
Black unemployment rate went up in 
that May report because we have deep 
inequities from our systems of income 
and wealth. 
We have deep inequalities in our 
school systems. Title I is persistently 
underfunded by over $30 billion every 
year. Think about the $2.1 trillion we 
are spending to help keep the economy 
from going underwater in this short pe-
riod of time. My goodness, we could 
spend $300 billion over 10 years to fully 
fund title I. 
We are seeing continued discrimina-
tion in housing and the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development has to 
make efforts to advance fairness. 
We have a lot of work to do in this 
country. We have a lot of work to do in 
the Senate. 
This is a moment of reckoning for 
this country—another one. This time, 
let’s not allow it to pass and let’s 
start—let’s start—right now by taking 
up and passing the Justice in Policing 
Act. But that is just a start. We have 
so much more work to do to build a 
truly more perfect union and to live up 
to the promise of equal rights and 
equal justice and equal opportunity 
and really ensure that we have equal 
justice under law, which of course is 
ensconced above the Supreme Court of 
the United States. 
Let’s get to work. Let’s do it now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I come to the floor today because it is 
time to end systemic racism with sys-
temic change. So I am calling on my 
colleagues to work with us to imme-
diately bring the Justice in Policing 
Act to the floor. 
I thank Senator BOOKER, who is here 
with us today, and Senator HARRIS for 
their work on this bill, as well as the 
House Members who are leading in the 
other Chamber. We must pass this bill, 
and we should do it immediately with 
bipartisan support. 
George Floyd should be alive today, 
but he isn’t. He was murdered in my 
State. He was murdered in my city. He 
was murdered on videotape so the 
whole world could see it. The whole 
world saw as his life evaporated before 
our eyes. 
Our Nation has been left in pain, 
grieving, marching, and demanding 
justice. His murder has galvanized a 
nationwide movement for justice, both 
for George Floyd and for the Black 
community and communities of color 
across America that have experienced 
injustice for far too long—not just in-
justice at the hands of the police, but 
also economic injustice, educational 
injustice. And, if anything, these last 
few months of this pandemic have shed 
a big magnifying glass and put it on 
top of what has been happening for way 
too long. 
As we grieve this loss, we have work 
to do in our own States, and that is 
justice in this particular case, includ-
ing accountability for the officers in-
volved. Minnesota Attorney General 
Keith Ellison, whom I have known for 
many, many years—I am very sure that 
he will have full faith and has forever 
in his conviction for justice, and he is 
pursuing this case against the officers. 
But as lawmakers, we must also 
make systemic change. We cannot an-
swer our Nation’s calls for justice with 
silence. That would make us complicit. 
We cannot answer with what the Presi-
dent called domination. That would 
make us monsters. We must answer 
with action. That is what makes us 
lawmakers. 
Since I have come to the Senate 13 
years ago, I have watched as change 
has come inch by inch. I see Senator 
DURBIN with us today, who led the ef-
fort on changing the disparity on crack 
cocaine. I was a new member of the Ju-
diciary Committee when he led that 
work. I see Senator BOOKER here. Both 
of them, as well as a number of us, 
worked on the FIRST STEP Act. That 
was really important to reduce sen-
tencing for nonviolent offenders. But, 
again, it is inch by inch. We must move 
by miles. 
There is systemic racism at every 
level of our justice system, and it has

taken far too long to right these 
wrongs. And it is on us in Congress, es-
pecially on those of us who have 
worked in this system—mayors, pros-
ecutors, attorneys general. Those of us 
who have seen what is happening have 
a special obligation to make this 
change. 
We took an oath as Senators. We 
didn’t wave a Bible in the air for a 
photo op. We placed our hand on that 
Bible and swore to support and defend 
the Constitution against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic. That enemy we 
face right now is racism; it is injustice. 
This is not a time for half measures 
and equivocation. It is a time for real 
change and swift action, including 
holding police officers accountable for 
misconduct and violence, changing po-
lice practices, and making our justice 
system more transparent. 
There are a lot of good police officers 
out there—a lot of good police offi-
cers—but they are brought down, just 
as our entire community is, when you 
have someone like Derek Chauvin com-
mit the murder that he did. When they 
watch the videotape, they feel like we 
feel. And that is why this bill is so im-
portant—the Justice in Policing Act. 
This 
comprehensive 
legislation 
changes Federal law so that officers 
can be held accountable for misconduct 
and increases that transparency and 
improves police training. 
First, on accountability, the Justice 
in Policing Act will hold officers ac-
countable for misconduct and violence 
by changing the Federal use-of-force 
standard from reasonable to necessary 
so that force is only used when nec-
essary to prevent death or serious in-
jury, and it requires States to adopt 
similar stands if they want to receive 
certain Federal funding. 
Changing the standard is not just 
some little legalese word that makes a 
change. It will save lives. 
When these changes have been adopt-
ed at the local level, there has been a 
significant drop in the use of force. 
These words can be the difference be-
tween whether a prosecutor can prove 
a case against a police officer or not. 
People 
ask 
what 
has 
happened 
around the country with some of these 
cases—some of these blatant things 
that people recently have seen on vid-
eotape. 
In my State, Philando Castile, who 
was in a neighboring jurisdiction to 
Minneapolis—look at what these stand-
ards are. Lawmakers have control over 
these standards. Even when a case like 
that was prosecuted with excellent 
prosecutors, who did their all, they 
were not able to get a guilty verdict. 
Look at the standards. 
In addition to improving the way 
that individual officers are held ac-
countable for misconduct, the bill 
holds police departments accountable, 
because we know that there are sys-
tematic changes that are needed at po-
lice departments. 
I have called on the Department of 
Justice, along with 26 of my colleagues, 
to conduct a full-scale investigation 
into the patterns and practices of the 
Minneapolis Police Department. We 
have waited weeks for a response. 
Under the Obama administration, 25 
of these pattern and practice investiga-
tions were brought. Under the Trump 
Justice Department, just one unit of 
one department in Springfield, MA, 
was examined. 
Now, just as I headed to the floor 
here, we got a letter from the Justice 
Department, but they did not commit 
to this investigation. They said they 
were going to continue to look at the 
evidence. 
Meanwhile, the Governor of Min-
nesota and the State human rights de-
partment has had to fill in. They are 
conducting their own investigation, 
and I have faith that they will do the 
right thing. But, again, this should be 
coming from the Justice Department. 
We know that Minnesota is not the 
only State whose recent events have 
shown us misconduct from the police 
and that have experienced a pattern 
and practice that need to be examined. 
But, again, we wait that investigation 
from the Department of Justice. 
After what we saw on the video, is it 
not warranted in this case to have such 
an investigation? I would ask the Jus-
tice Department under Donald Trump 
and under William Barr: What facts 
would warrant an investigation if not 
these? 
In addition to improving the tools to 
hold police accountable, we also need 
to ensure that there is transparency so 
we can once again build trust with our 
communities. What does this mean? 
Well, it means that we have officers 
that actually get in trouble in one de-
partment and then they go to another 
department and no one even knows 
what happens. It means that the public 
does not have access to information 
about serious issues of misconduct that 
are held tightly within city depart-
ments and city archives in some place, 
when in fact it is a matter of life and 
death for the people of this country. 
And, of course, we need wholesale 
changes to the way policing happens. I 
worked with Senators SMITH and GILLI-
BRAND to include provisions in the bill 
to require States to ban the use of 
choke holds in policing to receive cer-
tain Federal funding and to ban them 
overall. 
This would be an important change 
that actually would help with prosecu-
tions across the country, if this prac-
tice was actually banned. 
George Floyd’s murder, at the hands 
of police officers, was horrific and in-
humane and, sadly, as we know, not 
the first or last time a Black man was 
taken too soon by those in uniform. We 
must stop this cycle of violence to get 
something done. 
We have an opportunity to make real 
change here, and if Leader MCCONNELL 
refuses to bring this bill to the floor, 
he and his colleagues who support him 
are on the wrong side of history. 
In the words of George Floyd’s fam-
ily, whom I had the honor to speak 
with, ‘‘We will demand and ultimately 
force lasting change by shining a light 
on this and by winning justice.’’ 
I will conclude with this. A few years 
ago, like so many of my colleagues, I 
went to Selma, AL, with Representa-
tive JOHN LEWIS. I stood there on the 
bridge where he had his head beaten in. 
I was in awe of his persistence, his re-
silience, and his faith that this country 
could always do better. 
That weekend, after 48 years, the 
White police chief of Montgomery 
handed his police badge to Congress-
man LEWIS, and he publicly apologized 
on behalf of police for not protecting 
Congressman LEWIS and the Freedom 
Marchers 48 years before. 
I don’t want it to take another 48 
years for my city to heal. I don’t want 
it to take another 48 years for my 
State to heal or for this country to 
heal or for our Nation to fix a justice 
system that has been broken since it 
was built. I want justice now. The 
voices you hear from across the coun-
try—they want justice now. 
It is time we delivered, and not just 
in platitudes. It is time we acted, and 
not just talk about acting. This is our 
moment. This is history. So let’s make 
history. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss the 
Senate plan for justice reform. 
First, it is important to note that 
justice will not come from any commu-
nity with lawlessness. It will not come 
from any community with a disregard 
for law and order. It will not come 
from any community with radical cuts 
in police budgets in cities like New 
York and Los Angeles. It will not come 
from any community that defunds the 
police. 
These are not the solutions that 
Americans are seeking. Yet I see head-
lines from around the country with pic-
tures of those demonstrating and ap-
plauding Democrat politicians who are 
calling for defunding of the police—the 
Democrat politicians who are demand-
ing not just defunding but also disman-
tling the police in their own commu-
nities. 
That will not work. That will not 
work, and the American people see it 
and they know it. In fact, a new ABC 
poll finds that 64 percent of Americans 
oppose these dangerous, liberal ideas 
like defunding the police, and 60 per-
cent oppose police department budget 
cuts. 
Liberal 
leaders, 
meanwhile—look, 
they have let anarchists occupy part of 
Seattle. You turn on the TV, and you 
can see what is happening there. They 
have actually burned down a police 
precinct. 
They called this area CHAZ—C-H-A- 
Z—the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. 
Can you imagine such a thing? Well, 
now they have renamed it to CHOP, 
which stands for the Capitol Hill Occu-
pied Protest. Whatever they want to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2993 
June 16, 2020 
call it, to me and to Americans all 
across the country, it is still criminal 
lawlessness. 
Democrats and Republicans need to 
stand up to these dangerous radicals. 
We must never defund or disband the 
police—never. Defunding police depart-
ments is a dangerous idea. Violent 
crime will spike. Call 911, and no one 
will be there to respond to your emer-
gency. 
I believe that rather than defund, we 
must defend the police as appropriate 
and make sure that we invest more in 
law enforcement, not less. We need to 
improve 
police 
training, 
account-
ability, transparency, recruiting, and 
community engagement, and that is 
what the Republican bill does. 
House Democrats have written a very 
partisan bill, aimed at making over 
and taking over—not just making over 
but also taking over—policing in Amer-
ica. The Democrats’ plan would nation-
alize the police—nationalize it—18,000 
police units and 800,000 police officers— 
nationalize the police and, of course, 
without adequate funding. 
The truth is that the House isn’t 
even in session. Their plan was written 
in secret. House Democrats didn’t con-
sult 
Republicans 
and, 
apparently, 
didn’t even consult a number of their 
own Members. They didn’t plan to de-
bate the bill and don’t plan to debate it 
for a couple of weeks. 
As you know, Republicans, on the 
other hand, have been working and lis-
tening, and we are leading. Our effort, 
of course, is led by Senator TIM SCOTT 
of South Carolina. We have developed 
what I believe is a smart plan and a 
workable solution. The bill is called 
the JUSTICE Act. It is written to gar-
ner bipartisan support, and I hope some 
of our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle will join in this effort. 
This is a sensible measure that will 
make bipartisan justice reform a re-
ality that we need. It is not a political 
exercise. It is practical legislation, and 
it deserves to become law. So I hope 
Democrats will join in the effort. 
The JUSTICE Act includes a number 
of very important reforms. It provides 
for every police officer in the country 
to use body cameras to curb the unnec-
essary use of force. I will tell you that 
I believe that body cameras have made 
a difference in changing the hearts of 
Americans all across the country. 
It requires States that receive Fed-
eral grants to report details of all uses 
of force causing death or serious in-
jury. For the first time, we will have 
real, actionable data. 
It promotes greater access to officer 
employment records to improve hiring 
practices. This prevents bad officers 
from moving from one department to 
another. 
It provides funds to help police de-
partments recruit and hire officer can-
didates that better reflect the diversity 
of the communities in which they 
serve. 
It requires higher standards for po-
lice to obtain and use no-knock search 
warrants. These warrants will allow of-
ficers to enter homes without announc-
ing their presence. 
Our bill creates two commissions to 
report back to Congress. A new com-
mission on civil rights will study and 
report on ways to address issues affect-
ing Black men and boys, and a criminal 
justice commission, modeled on the 
9/11 
Commission, 
will 
recommend 
criminal justice reforms. 
Now, the Senate has already passed 
this commission, and we have done it 
unanimously. We sent it to the House 
and they have failed to act. 
Our bill also requires police training 
on 
deescalation 
tactics 
and 
alter-
natives to the use of force. 
I believe the JUSTICE Act is impor-
tant legislation. I would like to see it 
on the floor in the very near future. 
Still, there are limits to Federal ac-
tion. Law enforcement is governed by 
State laws and is largely managed by 
local officials. State and local leaders 
must step up and do their part. 
With the JUSTICE Act, we have 
taken an essential step forward in what 
we all realize is a necessary process. 
So I urge all my colleagues—on both 
sides of the aisle—to support this plan 
for necessary justice reform. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to complete my re-
marks before the lunch recess. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as the 
Nation discusses the need for police re-
forms, our work in the Senate to de-
liver those reforms is ramping up. This 
afternoon, the Judiciary Committee, 
on which the Presiding Officer and I 
serve, will be holding a hearing to ex-
amine the use of force and community 
relations. 
I am glad that our witnesses include 
two outstanding Texas witnesses—Erin 
Nealy Cox, the U.S. Attorney of the 
Northern District of Texas, and Chief 
Art Acevedo, Chief of the Houston Po-
lice Department and also the chair of 
the Major Cities Chiefs Association. I 
know they will be able to help shed 
some light on the changes that need to 
be made to restore trust between offi-
cers and the communities they serve, 
and I appreciate their willingness to 
share their perspectives with us. 
It is important, I believe, for us to 
hear from a variety of sources as we de-
bate what those potential reforms 
might look like: those who represent 
law 
enforcement, 
community 
and 
faith-based organizations, and the men 
and women who get up every day and 
put on the uniform to protect us by 
serving in law enforcement agencies. 
We need to hear from all of them. 
In recent weeks, African Americans 
across the country have shared their 
experiences with law enforcement—sto-
ries we have heard of being profiled, 
discriminated against, targeted, and 
having a negative perception of law en-
forcement that even in dangerous situ-
ations they are afraid to call the po-
lice. Really, the way it was described 
in a meeting I had on Friday in Dallas 
by Chief Hall and Sheriff Brown is that 
they called it a wedge between law en-
forcement and some minority commu-
nities for lack of trust. John Crusoe, 
the district attorney, said because of 
the number of offenses for which mi-
norities are arrested and prosecuted, it 
seemed to be disproportionate. They 
have the impression that somehow 
they are being targeted unfairly. We 
know that even our friend, TIM SCOTT, 
an African-American Senator, has said 
he knows what it is like to be driving 
while Black and to be stopped, where 
somebody who looks like me would not 
be stopped by the police. 
We need to work our way through 
this. We know that Black parents have 
spoken openly about their concerns for 
their own sons and daughters and that 
lessons that they have given them of 
what they should do if pulled over by 
the police: turning off the car, rolling 
down the windows, placing their hands 
on the dashboard, and explaining what 
they are doing before reaching in their 
pocket for their driver’s license. 
Well, the lack of trust between law 
enforcement and our communities isn’t 
unfounded, but it is unsustainable. In 
order for every American to not only 
be safe but feel safe, we need to enact 
long overdue reforms to our Nation’s 
police departments. Mostly, these are 
not prescriptive in nature. These are in 
the realm of being an assistance to our 
law 
enforcement 
officials 
and 
not 
somehow assuming, as some do, that 
racial 
discrimination 
is 
rampant 
among law enforcement. I don’t believe 
that. I don’t believe that there is sys-
temic racial discrimination in our law 
enforcement officers where they target 
minorities. I just don’t believe that. 
I do believe there are some bad actors 
who abuse their power and violate even 
the status of their own police depart-
ment. And, unfortunately, in the exam-
ple of the officer who had his knee on 
the neck of George Floyd, we know 
that there have been 17 separate com-
plaints made against him in their in-
ternal affairs division there, but, ap-
parently, neither the police depart-
ment nor the city leadership—the 
mayor and city council—did anything 
about it, or if they did, we have not yet 
learned about it. 
Well, we know that Senator SCOTT 
has been leading the effort in our con-
ference to try to come up with a rea-
sonable 
package 
of 
legislative 
re-
sponses, and it is really kind of sur-
prising to me to see the overlap be-
tween the political parties and also our 
colleagues in the House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2994 
June 16, 2020 
Now, there are some things that I 
don’t think we should do. For example, 
there are some who call for reforming 
qualified immunity, a judicial doctrine 
that protects the discretionary acts of 
a government employee or government 
official and holds them financially re-
sponsible only if they violate an estab-
lished standard. Well, the same legal 
doctrine that protects police officers 
protects school teachers as well, and I 
will bet that a number of our col-
leagues who are calling for wholesale 
reform of qualified immunity didn’t 
even know that. 
Well, as I said, it is important that 
we hear from a variety of voices, and 
that is why I appreciate Mayor John-
son in Dallas hosting a roundtable with 
a group of law enforcement leaders and 
faith leaders who are committed to de-
livering real change. I spent a few min-
utes talking about what we are doing 
here in Washington, but I spent most of 
my time listening. I think that is 
something we need to do more of—to 
listen. We are all pretty good at talk-
ing, but we need to do more listening. 
Everyone agrees that there is a prob-
lem—a big one—that will not go away 
if we ignore it. As the mayor acknowl-
edged, the fact that everyone agrees 
that the status quo is not sustainable 
represents progress in and of itself. 
That is the first step toward solving a 
problem—recognizing that you have 
one. But now it is time to turn that 
consensus into collective action. 
We know that many of the changes 
that need to be made will happen at 
the local and State level. At the U.S. 
Congress, we have a Capitol Police, but 
we don’t control what happens in the 
Minneapolis Police Department or the 
Dallas Police Department or San Anto-
nio or any other locally run and con-
trolled law enforcement agency. We 
know that they are not all the same. 
Most major law enforcement agencies, 
like the one in Dallas, have deescala-
tion training. It has been mandatory 
for years. 
So when people talk about doing that 
and mandating it here from Wash-
ington, the fact is that most of our 
major law enforcement agencies are al-
ready doing a lot of these things, like 
banning choke holds, for example. One 
of the participants in our roundtable 
was Frederick Frazier, a longtime law 
enforcement 
officer 
who 
actually 
trains officers in deescalation. 
More recently, the Dallas Police De-
partment banned choke holds, as I 
mentioned, and any use of force in-
tended to restrict a person’s airways. 
They have also embraced a policy re-
quiring officers to intervene in a situa-
tion where use of force is unnecessary 
and inappropriate. For example, if a 
law enforcement officer sees another 
officer use excessive force or dealing 
with that use of force inappropriately, 
the Dallas Police Department requires 
the other officers who witnessed that 
to intervene—something we did not see 
happen in Minneapolis. 
During our discussion, Chief Hall also 
discussed steps they are taking to re-
lease body camera or dash camera foot-
age and overall increased transparency. 
Similar changes are being made in cit-
ies across Texas and across the coun-
try, and I think transparency is an im-
portant area where changes can and 
should occur. A one-size-fits-all Fed-
eral approach to policing would be, I 
think, a mistake. 
But here in Washington, we do have a 
role to play. We have both the oppor-
tunity and the responsibility to ensure 
that America’s police departments are 
helping public safety and are not con-
sidered to be a threat by the commu-
nities they serve. The bill being led by 
Senator SCOTT would take major steps 
in the right direction. While the final 
details are being ironed out, our discus-
sions have included a range of pro-
posals that would address everything 
from training to transparency, to mi-
nority hiring. 
I am not interested in passing a bill 
for the sake of just checking a box and 
saying we have done something signifi-
cant. That route is sure to lead to even 
more problems. I am interested in de-
livering real reforms, as I am confident 
all of my colleagues here in the Senate 
are, and I think our legislative efforts 
can produce a product that will be re-
sponsive to the crisis we are now expe-
riencing—a crisis largely of trust. 
Of course, for those changes to reach 
communities in Texas, they also need 
to be able to pass not only a Repub-
lican-controlled Senate but a Demo-
cratic-controlled House and be signed 
by President Trump, and I believe the 
legislation we will unveil tomorrow 
could deliver in each of those bodies. I 
think each of us has a responsibility to 
take action to repair and address the 
fear, the anger, and the lack of trust 
between law enforcement and our com-
munities, and this bill does an impor-
tant first step. 
I am proud to have worked with Sen-
ator SCOTT and all of our colleagues in 
this effort, and we all will make our 
contribution before we are through. I 
am looking forward to sharing those 
details tomorrow during the press con-
ference. 
With that, I yield the floor.

TAXPAYER FIRST ACT OF 2019— 
Continued 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, 
yesterday, we had a series of successful 
votes to move forward on the Great 
American Outdoors Act. I am excited 
with the votes we have taken last week 
and the votes last night and that we 
will finally move to passage of the leg-
islation, the Great American Outdoors 
Act, tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
We had the opportunity over the last 
several 
weeks—last 
week, 
in 
par-
ticular—to talk about what it means 
for every State in the country, what it 
means for every county in the country, 
and the significant opportunity for 
conservation, which is the crown jewel 
of 
conservation 
programs 
and, 
of 
course, our national parks. It is not 
just national parks, of course. It is our 
forests, and it is our BLM grounds and 
the efforts we have with the Bureau of 
Indian Education. 
I thought I would talk specifically 
about some Colorado projects today 
and what the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund has meant for Colo-
rado. 
This is a photo of Wilson Peak in Col-
orado. It rises over Telluride in south-
west Colorado. Wilson Peak is one of 
the 54 mountains in Colorado that top 
14,000 feet. Climbers and hikers eager 
to summit the 14,500-foot peak, located 
in the Lizard Head Wilderness, have 
been frustrated for years by key land 
access routes being blocked, which 
made it impossible to get to. In addi-
tion, Wilson Peak long remained the 
last ‘‘fourteener’’ in Colorado without 
public access. 
Through 9 years, very complex land 
exchange negotiations, and work to as-
semble suitable exchange properties 
and funding, the Trust for Public Land 
purchased 25 patented mining claims, 
including the summit and key portions 
of the main summit trail from multiple 
private owners. In 2011, the Trust for 
Public Land formally transferred own-
ership of land to the U.S. Forest Serv-
ice, ensuring in perpetuity the public 
access to Wilson Peak summit. 
If you go to the next one, this is a 
photograph of the Big Thompson River. 
In 1976, rains began to pour near Estes 
Park, CO, and caused one of the biggest 
natural disasters in Colorado’s history. 
A remarkable 12 inches of rain fell in 
about 4 hours. As a reminder, there are 
areas of Colorado that only get about 
14 inches of moisture a year. A remark-
able 12 inches of rain fell in about 4 
hours, bringing the Big Thompson 
River to 19 feet above its normal level, 
and sending 31,000 cubic feet per second 
of water racing downstream, down the 
canyon, carrying with it everything 
and anything in its path. The flood 
claimed 145 lives, 418 homes, 52 busi-
nesses, and caused millions and mil-
lions of dollars of damage in 1976. 
In the aftermath of the disaster, 
Larimer County recognized that simply 
rebuilding new homes in harm’s way 
within the floodway didn’t make sense. 
The county turned to the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund as an impor-
tant part of the solution. With just 
over $1 million from Land and Water 
Conservation Fund and some other 
matching resources, the county ac-
quired a number of properties along the 
Big Thompson River, which provided

new outdoor recreation opportunities 
to residents and visitors on 156 acres of 
land along the river, highlighted by 
four new county parks. This has been 
an incredible recreation opportunity, 
but it has certainly led to greater safe-
ty for Coloradans. 
The Blanca Wetlands Area of Critical 
Environmental Concern is another in-
credible area of Colorado. The Bureau 
of Land Management has benefited. 
After decades of water overappropria-
tion caused the lowering of the valley’s 
water table, the rapid disappearance of 
wetlands and plummeting bird popu-
lation, State and Federal agencies ini-
tiated the Wetland Restoration Effort 
in the 1960s, including this wetlands 
area. You can see the work we have 
done with the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund on this. 
Red Mountain Pass is another exam-
ple. It is a multiphased project com-
pleted by the Trust for Public Lands 
and Colorado Partners with funding 
from the LWCF. It is a scenic property 
lying above the town of Ouray that 
forms portions of the panoramic back-
drop used by motorists from Highway 
550’s Red Mountain Pass and on Ouray 
and San Juan Counties’ rugged alpine 
loops. It is an incredible experience. 
You can see the work we have done 
with it here. 
If you go to the Uncompahgre Na-
tional Forest, over the years, LWCF 
has invested nearly $27 million into the 
Uncompahgre[-]San Juan National For-
est of Colorado to protect this valley, 
which is a 10-year-long process that ul-
timately resulted in the conservation 
of thousands of acres surrounding the 
town. It is incredible for recreation and 
preservation—this critical habitat and 
environmental treasure and conserva-
tion accomplishment for all of the 
country. 
I also want to point out some of the 
great news about this bill back in Colo-
rado. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
this article from the Durango Herald, 
which was written on June 13, and an 
article from the Denver Post, dated 
June 9, 2020. 
There being no objection, the mate-

RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Durango Herald, June 13, 2020] 
‘HOLY GRAIL’ CONSERVATION BILL ADVANCES 
IN U.S. SENATE 
(By Jacob Wallace) 
A new bill funding maintenance and im-
provement projects for public lands is gain-
ing steam in the U.S. Senate. 
The Great American Outdoors Act would 
permanently fund the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, a trust set up by the U.S. 
government to pay for park maintenance 
projects, and establish a consistent source of 
revenue for park conservation that would re-
duce years of maintenance backlog through-
out public lands. 
The bill, spearheaded by Sen. Cory Gard-
ner, R–Colo., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D– 
W.Va., passed on an 80–17 vote Monday, al-
lowing it to proceed to floor debate in the 
Senate. 
‘‘This is a historic opportunity for us, in a 
bipartisan fashion, to pass the most signifi-
cant conservation measure in over 50 years,’’ 
Gardner said. 
More than 800 conservation and outdoor 
recreation groups have signed on to a letter 
published in March supporting the bill, argu-
ing that it was a permanent fix to a long-ne-
glected issue. The Outdoor Alliance, one of 
the nonprofit organizations that signed the 
letter, pushed to expand the legislation to 
include the Bureau of Land Management and 
other public agencies in addition to the Na-
tional Park Service. 
‘‘This is definitely the biggest investment 
in parks and public lands that we’ve seen in 
years, in decades,’’ said Tania Lown-Hecht, 
spokeswoman for the Outdoor Alliance. 
‘‘This is not to be underestimated.’’ 
If passed, the bill would mandate $1.9 bil-
lion in money raised from offshore oil and 
gas leases, and other energy projects would 
go toward outdoor maintenance and recre-
ation projects through 2025. It would also 
fully fund the about $900 million budget of 
the LWCF, with the money split between the 
National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, 
Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land 
Management and Bureau of Indian Edu-
cation, with the bulk of the money going to 
national parks. 
Lown-Hecht and others have been making 
the pitch that conservation spending is a 
strong job creator: One study found that 
every $1 million spent on the LWCF could 
support between 16.8 and 30.8 jobs. 
‘‘It will put people to work in public lands, 
and that’s an investment that will bring 
back more than a dollar for every dollar 
spent,’’ Lown-Hecht said. 
The LWCF was created in 1964 and was 
based on the idea that the depletion of one 
natural resource, offshore oil and gas, should 
be offset by the care of other natural re-
sources protected as parks. 
Since that time, however, Congress has 
often failed to appropriate the full amount of 
money that the fund could have received 
each year, creating a logjam of maintenance 
projects in national parks across the country 
that have totaled to more than $30 billion in 
deferred 
maintenance, 
according 
to 
the 
fund’s own account. 
The bill gained momentum after Sens. 
Gardner and Steve Daines, R–Mont., visited 
the White House in March to convince Presi-
dent Donald Trump to support the bill. Since 
then, the bill has earned the attention of 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as 
well as other Republican senators eager to 
support a bipartisan bill during an election 
year. 
Gardner also noted that the timing of the 
bill is especially prescient as rural commu-
nities in Southwest Colorado and elsewhere 
have been hard hit by a drop in tourism and 
job losses during the pandemic. Advocates 
agree, arguing park projects could be part of 
a broader plan for recovery. 
‘‘We see this as a way to not only address 
the maintenance backlog on these lands but 
to put jobs on the ground for people where 
they’ve lost them,’’ said Tom Cors, policy di-
rector for The Nature Conservancy. 
The Senate will continue to debate the bill 
throughout the week. Sen. Michael Bennet, 
D–Colo., has also announced his support of 
the bill. If it passes, the House of Represent-
atives will then have the option to vote on 
an identical companion bill introduced last 
week. 
Cors is cautiously optimistic about the 
bill’s chances, saying it is a conservation win 
55 years in the making. 
‘‘We’ve been working on this for years and 
years and this is the holy grail of the con-
servation community,’’ Cors said. ‘‘We’re ec-
static that this is happening’’ 
[From the Denver Post, June 9, 2020] 
WITH CORY GARDNER LEADING THE CHARGE, 
SENATE TAKES UP GREAT AMERICAN OUT-
DOORS ACT 
(By Bruce Finley) 
Colorado senators are leading a congres-
sional push to pass landmark conservation 
legislation that would deploy $9.5 billion to 
maintain overrun national parks and perma-
nently direct $900 million a year for outdoor 
recreation on public lands. 
President Donald Trump has said he will 
sign this Great American Outdoors Act if 
lawmakers get it to his desk. Senators this 
week took up the issue, aiming for a vote 
next Tuesday, and around 200 House mem-
bers have said they’ll support similar legisla-
tion. 
Conservationists 
for 
decades 
have 
prioritized these measures as crucial steps to 
ensure healthy public lands, increasingly 
seen as essential for a booming recreation in-
dustry that has become an economic main-
stay, especially in Colorado and the West. 
Congress has failed to provide the full $900 
million a year for land acquisition and other 
spending that the 1965 Land and Water Con-
servation Act requires. Lawmakers have ap-
proved spending between $255 million and 
$450 million a year since 2008 and only twice 
in 55 years provided the full $900 million. 
National Park Service officials have esti-
mated deferred maintenance as land and fa-
cilities deteriorate will cost more than $20 
billion. 
‘‘We’ve been trying for decades to get this 
done. Now we have an historic window to ac-
tually achieve it. This is a moment where we 
need to capitalize to get this great achieve-
ment accomplished,’’ Sen. Cory Gardner said 
in an interview Tuesday. 
On March 3, Gardner, of Yuma, went to the 
White House and, in a discussion with 
Trump, showed a photo he’d taken on his 
iPhone of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison 
National Park in Colorado. Trump said it 
was beautiful. Gardner also said he pointed 
to a portrait of President Teddy Roosevelt, a 
leading conservationist, in suggesting that 
Trump support could lead to a major 
achievement. He said Trump gazed up at the 
portrait and said he would sign the legisla-
tion. 
Sen. Michael Bennet of Denver is one of 
some 60 Senate sponsors of the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act but is proposing amending 
it to include the Colorado Outdoor Recre-
ation and Economy (CORE) Act, which would 
protect about 400,000 acres of public land in 
Colorado, establishing new wilderness and 
recreation opportunities. 
‘‘This week, we have an opportunity to se-
cure new protections for public lands in Col-
orado that were left out of the public lands 
bill Congress passed last year,’’ Bennet said, 
urging colleagues to incorporate the CORE 
Act ‘‘or to quickly pass’’ it on its own. 
Gardner said, regarding the amendment, 
that Bennet ‘‘may try to get a vote on that. 
That is his bill. The GAOA certainly will 
help the CORE Act.’’ 
A June 3 letter to congressional leaders 
from six former Department of Interior sec-
retaries, including Ken Salazar (2009–2013) 
and Gale Norton (2001–2006) of Colorado, 
urged swift passage of the GAOA ‘‘without 
any amendments.’’ 
This push to provide permanent full fund-
ing for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund and step up public lands maintenance 
reflects years of wrangling in Congress to 
support outdoors recreation on public land. 
The Land and Water Conservation Act, 
passed in 1965, says money should go to fed-
eral agencies to acquire land and to states 
for acquisition of land and waters and to de-
velop recreation facilities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2996 
June 16, 2020 
The Great American Outdoors Act com-
bines two previous bills that each had strong 
majority bipartisan support. One part would 
provide full and permanent funding of $900 
million each year, the amount the fund is 
authorized to receive, from offshore oil and 
gas revenues—not tax dollars. The other 
aims for parks restoration by investing $1.9 
billion annually for the next five years to 
maintain land managed by the National 
Park Service, Forest Service, Fish and Wild-
life Service, Bureau of Indian Education and 
Bureau of Land Management. 
Conservation groups have welcomed the 
bill. 
‘‘This will be a remarkable gift for the fu-
ture and also is important for the present. 
It’s going to put up to 100,000 people to work 
each year fixing our national parks,’’ said 
Tracy Stone-Manning, associate vice presi-
dent for public lands at the National Wildlife 
Federation, a conservation group with 6 mil-
lion members. 
Beyond national parks and forests, the 
congressional spending each year could help 
cities such as Denver and Missoula, where 
urban voters are pushing leaders to acquire 
more land for parks and other open space. 
‘‘Our parks and open space set-asides need 
to grow with our population. We’ve seen, 
during the pandemic, the importance of the 
ability to be safely outside in parks,’’ Stone- 
Manning said. 
‘‘Denver could identify property that is 
worth acquiring and use Land and Water 
Conservation Fund dollars to help acquire 
it,’’ she said. ‘‘Humans have to have access 
to nature for our health, and we have a long- 
term need to protect our larger landscapes.’’ 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, 
this article is entitled the ‘‘ ‘Holy 
Grail’ conservation bill advances in 
U.S. Senate.’’ If you take a look at the 
article, it quotes conservationists and 
people across the country who are 
working on the legislation, and it ends 
with this: 
‘‘We’ve been working on this for years and 
years and this is the holy grail of conserva-
tion community,’’ Cors said. We’re ecstatic 
that this is happening. 
That is from a member of the Nature 
Conservancy. 
The article from the Denver Post 
talks about the legislation and, again, 
the conservation community that sup-
ports the legislation. 
‘‘This will be a remarkable gift for the fu-
ture and also is important for the present. 
It’s going to put up to 100,000 people to work 
each year fixing our national parks,’’ said 
Tracy-Stone Manning, associate vice presi-
dent for public lands at the National Wildlife 
Federation, a conservation group with 6 mil-
lion members. 
It goes on to point out ‘‘cities such as 
Denver and Missoula, where urban vot-
ers are pushing leaders to acquire more 
land for parks and other open space.’’ 
This is an opportunity for us to 
achieve those goals in our urban areas. 
Finally, Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD a letter from a number of 
Coloradans in support of the Great 
American Outdoors Act sent to Con-
gress a few weeks ago. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
DEAR
SENATORS
&
REPRESENTATIVES: As 
Colorado-based businesses and organizations, 
we urge you to support our state’s great out-
doors through full funding of the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund {LWCF}. We ask 
that you lend your full support to passing 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund Per-
manent Funding Act, so that our nation’s 
most successful conservation program can 
continue its long track record of success. 
LWCF is built on a simple idea: that a por-
tion of offshore drilling fees should be used 
to protect important land and water for all 
Americans. Through its over 50-year history, 
LWCF has invested more than $278 million in 
Colorado’s public lands and outdoor recre-
ation. Funds have gone toward public lands 
including Colorado crown jewels like the 
Black Canyon of the Gunnison and Rocky 
Mountain National Parks, toward healthy 
working forests through the public-private 
partnerships of the Forest Legacy Program, 
and toward local parks and trail projects in 
communities across the state. 
These investments not only benefit the 
public lands and outdoor opportunities that 
are a valued part of our Colorado way of life, 
but also promote tourism and the outdoor 
recreation industry which are among our 
state’s most important economic drivers. 
The Outdoor Industry Association reports 
that active outdoor recreation in Colorado 
generates $28 billion in consumer spending, 
supporting 229,000 Colorado jobs. Our great 
outdoors isn’t just good fun—it’s good busi-

Congress last year passed permanent reau-

and our greatest treasures with the 
combined efforts of the Land and Water

and

Great 
American Outdoors Act in this legisla-
tion. 
As Members prepare for this vote to-
morrow, I hope they will consider the 
impact this will have on generations to 
come. 
Yesterday, we talked about a letter 
written by the great-grandson of Presi-
dent Teddy Roosevelt. The fact that we 
are continuing today that legacy to 
build on the conservation and the envi-
ronmental successes that started well 
over 100 years ago in this country and 
our public lands is an incredible treas-
ure that this country has and that we 
can build on for generations to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to speak about an over-
whelming and urgent need to reform 
the way our country approaches polic-
ing. The death of Eric Garner, Michael 
Brown, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, 
Tony McDade, Andrew Kearse, and 
countless others are deeply disturbing 
and, most unfortunately, nothing new. 
The truth is, for every name we 
know, there are countless more that we 
don’t. This type of oppression and bru-
tality has been part of Black-American 
lives for far too long. It should not hap-
pen, and in the horrific instances when 
it does, it should not take a viral video

June 16, 2020 
and a nationwide protest to get some 
measure of justice. 
We are at a moment of moral reck-
oning in this country, and we must 
take action. Our country needs bold re-
forms to address the systemic and in-
stitutional racism that plagues our 
criminal justice system. The Justice in 
Policing Act of 2020, introduced by my 
colleagues Senators BOOKER and HAR-
RIS, would make crucial and much 
needed changes to address our Nation’s 
policing practices and policies. We 
should pass this bill as soon as pos-
sible. 
We were reminded, sadly, of the ur-
gency of this legislation on Friday, 
when Rayshard Brooks was shot in the 
back by police in Atlanta. It is clear 
that we don’t have time to waste. Lives 
are on the line today. We need reform 
now. We need accountability, and we 
need it to happen now. 
The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 
would ban the no-knock warrant police 
used to enter Breonna Taylor’s apart-
ment before killing her. It would pre-
vent unnecessary deaths like Rayshard 
Brooks by requiring that officers use 
deescalation techniques and resort to 
deadly force only as the last resort. 
It also includes a provision that I 
worked on with Congressman HAKEEM 
JEFFRIES, the Eric Garner Excessive 
Force Prevention Act. It would ban the 
types of choke holds and carotid holds 
that killed George Floyd and Eric Gar-
ner by making the use of these dan-
gerous maneuvers a Federal civil rights 
violation. 
Black Americans are killed by police 
at more than twice the rate of White 
Americans, despite accounting for less 
than 13 percent of our population. This 
legislation would not only end racial 
and religious profiling, but it would 
mandate training on racial bias and on 
an officer’s duty to intervene. 
The bill would also improve account-
ability by requiring Federal uniform 
police officers to wear body cameras 
and require State and local law en-
forcement to use existing Federal fund-
ing to ensure their officers use body 
cameras as well. 
Too often, after these unthinkable 
incidents of brutality, we learn that 
law enforcement officers responsible 
had a history of misconduct. This bill 
would collect better and more accurate 
data on police misconduct and the use 
of force and create a national registry 
that would track officers’ complaint 
records throughout their careers. And 
it would improve the use of pattern and 
practice investigations into unconsti-
tutional and discriminatory policing 
practice at the Federal, State, and 
local levels. 
The fact is that 99 percent of killings 
by police do not result in any charges. 
Convictions on those charges are even 
rarer. This bill would amend the Fed-
eral criminal statute that has made it 
extremely difficult to prosecute law 
enforcement officers. 
Finally, the bill would take the long 
overdue step of making lynching a Fed-
eral crime. After the killing of Ahmaud 
Arbery, it is clear that this problem 
must be addressed. We can never bring 
back those who we have been lost in 
these horrific killings or even begin to 
make these families whole. But we can 
and must take steps toward making 
sure that these tragedies never happen 
again. 
An Executive order that merely re-
states the law that Congress passed in 
1994 is clearly not enough. Establishing 
justice is at the heart of the preamble 
of our Constitution, and we must de-
liver on the promise that we made as a 
nation. We must match the efforts of 
those working to change the system 
from the outside with the efforts of 
those who are changing the system 
from the inside, with efforts to change 
it for good. We have a lot of work 
ahead of us, and this bill will ensure 
that we start on the right foot. 
I would like to read a passage of 
Scripture that informs me on this 
issue. Matthew 25, verse 44: 
They also will answer: Lord, when did we 
see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or 
needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did 
not help you? 
He will reply: Truly, I tell you, whatever 
you did not do for one of the least of these, 
you did not do for me. 
Then, they will go away to eternal punish-
ment but the righteous to eternal life. 
We have a moral obligation. We have 
an obligation given our shared commit-
ment to upholding the Constitution. 
We have a moral responsibility to not 
let this moment pass. 
Who are we? What defines us? What 
kind of people are we? If we refuse to 
act now when the country is raging— 
rightfully so—we decline to do what is 
right. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
REMEMBERING LARRY WALSH, SR. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, 
earlier this month, Illinois lost a local 
legend after a courageous 5-year battle 
against cancer. 
A lifelong Illinoisan and a 50-year 
public servant, Larry Walsh, Sr., was 
known for his booming voice and big 
smile. He was a warm, welcoming pres-
ence in my life and the lives of his fam-
ily, friends, and countless others. 
Larry, much like the communities he 
would come to represent on the local, 
county, and State levels, embodied the 
spirit and ethos of Illinois. He was born 
in Elwood, into a family with deep 
roots in the farming community. Dedi-
cating his early life to the family 
trade, he graduated Joliet Junior Col-
lege, class of 1968, earning his associ-
ate’s degree in agriculture. 
In 1970, at only the age of 21, he made 
his foray into politics, winning an elec-
tion to the local school board. Just 3 
years later, he was elected as Jackson 
Township supervisor—a position he 
took great pride in and continued to 
hold until December of 2004. 
He was first elected to the Will Coun-
ty Board in 1974—a county he would ul-
timately lead as county executive for 
the last 16 years of his life. 
Will County is a great cross-section 
of Illinois. It is where the farmlands of 
Central and Southern Illinois converge 
with the industry of Chicago and Jo-
liet. It is not only home to over 100,000 
acres of farmland, but it is also a 
booming transportation hub anchored 
by North America’s largest inland port, 
the CenterPoint Intermodal Center—a 
project that Larry helped to land. 
Larry was one of the few Illinois politi-
cians who could credibly represent and 
be an advocate for both Illinois’s farm-
ing community and understand the re-
gion’s need for industrial expansion. 
Throughout his career in public serv-
ice, he was steadfastly committed to 
bipartisanship—an absolute must for a 
leader who would help guide Will Coun-
ty’s development into the fastest grow-
ing county in our State. 
Before he returned to the county 
board in 2004, Larry served in the Illi-
nois Senate, representing the 43rd Dis-
trict. In Springfield, he befriended a 
fellow freshman Senator and seatmate 
on the floor, Barack Obama. Their 
friendship would prove critical, as 
Larry helped introduce him to the 
farming community in Will, Kankakee, 
and Iroquois Counties and then became 
the first State senator to endorse him 
in what was then considered a long- 
shot run for the U.S. Senate in 2004. 
Larry’s list of accomplishments is 
quite long and spans a crucial time in 
Will County’s development. During 
Larry’s time in the State senate and 
his return to lead the Will County 
Board, the county experienced a 53-per-
cent growth in size and now is the 
fourth largest county in the State. 
Throughout his 16-year tenure as Will 
County executive—the longest Will 
County executive tenure ever—he re-
doubled his commitment to bipartisan, 
responsible community development. 
In addition to helping land CenterPoint 
Intermodal, he helped establish the 
Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie Re-
serve, championed the construction of 
a new Will County sheriff’s office law 
enforcement center, and broke ground 
on the new Will County Courthouse 
that will open this fall. 
Beyond elected service, he remained 
deeply rooted in and dedicated to his 
community. He was a member of the 
Joliet Exchange Club, the Elwood 
Lions Club, Friends of Hospice, and 
many local chambers of commerce. He 
passionately contributed to local char-
ities, like MorningStar Mission, Make- 
A-Wish Foundation, Boy Scouts of 
America, 
and 
Cornerstone, 
among 
many others. 
He was a lifelong parishioner of St. 
Rose of Lima Catholic Church in Wil-
mington. He attended daily Mass and 
was a Eucharistic minister and a mem-
ber of the Knights of Columbus. 
I can’t begin to do justice to the leg-
acy that Larry leaves behind, but to 
his wife, Irene, of 50 years, his six chil-
dren, and all the rest of his loved ones, 
please know how much we all cared for

and how much we all respected Larry 
and how greatly he will be missed. 
Thank you. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, as I do every week, this past 
weekend, I went back to Tennessee. I 
will tell you, it really did my heart a 
lot of good to see people who are out 
and 
about 
and 
enjoying 
beautiful 
weather and enjoying our beautiful 
State. Nashville is beginning to open 
the doors of our music venues. Our 
church bells are ringing, people are at-
tending services, and our hikers are 
back exploring our beautiful State 
parks and the Smokies. 
Here on Capitol Hill, though, things 
really do look a lot different. When we 
come back into town, we still return to 
empty offices and emptier hallways. I 
will tell you, I have had a lot of people 
ask me: What in the world is happening 
in Washington these days? Well, even 
though the Chamber will look empty to 
those who are watching on TV, I want 
everybody who is watching to know 
that the Senate is here, and the Senate 
is at work. 
Before the pandemic sent everyone 
home, we had made great progress re-
pairing our Nation’s judiciary and fill-
ing empty seats at important Federal 
agencies. The Senate has placed 198 
well-qualified, constitutionalist judges 
on the Federal bench. This week, we 
are going to hit that 200 number. We 
will be considering more of our district 
court nominations in coming weeks. 
We are also preparing to consider the 
nomination of a former member of our 
House Republican Study Committee 
team. Russ Vought has been serving as 
OMB’s Acting Director since January 
of 2019, and soon we will decide whether 
to make that position permanent. I 
will tell you, I think Russ is more than 
worthy of that honor, and I encourage 
my colleagues to support his confirma-
tion when the time comes for that 
vote. 
CHINA 
At this point, we know for a fact that 
the Chinese Government withheld in-
formation about the novel coronavirus 
that could have spared the American 
people a lot of heartache and even pre-
vented the COVID–19 outbreak from es-
calating into a global pandemic. Their 
lies have already had catastrophic ef-
fects on the American economy, on loss 
of life, on people’s livelihoods, and on 
their well-being. But I think it is im-
portant to reiterate that this kind of 
behavior from China is not new. It is 
not new. It is just newly realized. 
For a long time now, corporations, 
educational 
institutions, 
and 
even 
Members of this body have been happy 
to ignore the problem because of prof-
its. I have spoken at length about the 
many ways that Big Tech’s entangle-
ment with Beijing has jeopardized our 
privacy, intellectual property, and our 
Nation’s security. 
Everyone here is familiar with the 
Chinese Communist Party’s shameless 
use of political violence against the 
Uighurs, the Tibetans, and the Hong 
Kong freedom fighters, but what many 
don’t know is that the Chinese Com-
munist Party has been using their Con-
fucius Institute program to fly under 
the radar at American colleges and 
universities and to suppress informa-
tion about the true nature of the Chi-
nese Government’s role. 
These so-called institutes are pitched 
as opportunities to promote cultural 
studies, but in reality they are propa-
ganda mills directly funded by the Chi-
nese Communist Party. By design, they 
threaten academic liberty and free 
speech. But somehow Beijing has man-
aged to place 72 Confucius Institutes on 
American college campuses. It is hard 
to believe, but 72 of our Nation’s col-
leges and universities are hosts to 
these Chinese Communist Party-funded 
Confucius Institutes. They even say 
that this is part of their soft power and 
their propaganda. 
American students deserve to know 
who is really talking to them at these 
institutes. Last week, we took the first 
step toward protecting the integrity of 
our universities by passing the bipar-
tisan CONFUCIUS Act by unanimous 
consent. The bill would grant full man-
agerial authority to the universities 
that host Confucius Institutes and pro-
hibit the application of any foreign law 
on any campus of a host institution. 
This is one piece of a larger effort to 
expose the Chinese Communist Party’s 
efforts to pollute the minds of our 
young people. We thank Senator KEN-
NEDY for his leadership in passing this 
legislation last week. 
Earlier this year, I introduced the 
Transparency for Confucius Institutes 
Act, which would require ‘‘program 
participation 
agreements’’ 
between 
these institutes and their American 
hosts to address the way Chinese offi-
cials influence what can and cannot be 
taught in these programs. 
I also led a group of colleagues in 
urging 
Education 
Secretary 
Betsy 
DeVos to increase agency oversight of 
these programs so that we—the Amer-
ican people, the American taxpayer, 
students, 
and 
their 
families—know 
what is being taught and the programs 
that are being offered in these insti-
tutes and, also, know who is paying for 
this. 
Since March, life in America has 
changed dramatically, but the chal-
lenges and threats this country faces 
have not gone away. Because of that, it 
is important that, yes, we keep our at-
tention on these issues that are still 
out there. Even though our attention 
has been placed on the crisis and the 
matter at hand, we still have a duty to 
govern and to protect the country and 
her institutions from destructive influ-
ences at home and those that come 
from far away. 
I encourage my colleagues to remem-
ber this and to stay focused as we begin 
another 
week 
of 
negotiations 
and 
votes. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
BOSTOCK V. CLAYTON COUNTY, GEORGIA 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I 
rise today to offer a few thoughts 
about the Bostock case handed down 
by the Supreme Court yesterday. I 
have it here. I have now had a chance 
to read the case, the decision by the 
majority of the Court, and the two dis-
senting opinions. 
I have to say I agree with the news 
reports that have said that this is truly 
a seismic decision. It is truly a historic 
decision. It is truly a historic piece of 
legislation. 
This piece of legislation changes the 
scope of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It 
changes the meaning of the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act. It changes the text of the 
1964 Civil Rights Act. In fact, you 
might well argue it is one of the most 
significant and far-reaching updates to 
that historic piece of legislation since 
it was adopted all of those years ago. 
Make no mistake, this decision, this 
piece of legislation will have effects 
that range from employment law to 
sports to churches. 
There is only one problem with this 
piece of legislation. It was issued by a 
court, not by a legislature. It was writ-
ten by judges, not by the elected rep-
resentatives of the people. And it did 
what this Congress has pointedly de-
clined to do for years now, which is to 
change the text and the meaning and 
the application and the scope of a his-
toric piece of legislation. 
I think it is significant for another 
reason as well. This decision, this 
Bostock case and the majority who 
wrote it, represents the end of some-
thing. It represents the end of the con-
servative legal movement or the con-
servative legal project as we know it. 
After Bostock, that effort as we know 
it, as it has existed up to now, is over. 
I say this because if textualism and 
originalism give you this decision, if 
you 
can 
invoke 
textualism 
and 
originalism in order to reach a deci-
sion, an outcome fundamentally that 
changes the scope—meaning and appli-
cation 
of 
statutory 
law—then 
textualism, originalism, and all of 
those phrases don’t mean much at all. 
Those are the things we have been 
fighting for. That is what I thought we 
had been fighting for. Those who call 
ourselves legal conservatives, if we 
have been fighting for legalism and 
textualism and this is the result of 
that, then I have to say that it turns 
out we haven’t been fighting for very 
much, or maybe we have been fighting 
for quite a lot, but it has been exactly 
the opposite of what we thought we 
were fighting for.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2999 
June 16, 2020 
This is a very significant decision. It 
marks a turning point for every con-
servative, and it marks a turning point 
for the legal conservative movement. 
The legal conservative project has al-
ways depended on one group of people 
in particular, in order to carry the 
weight of the votes, to actually support 
this out in public, to get out there and 
make it possible electorally, and those 
are religious conservatives. I am one 
myself. 
Evangelicals, conservative Catholics, 
conservative Jews—they are the ones— 
let’s be honest—they are the ones who 
have been the core of the legal conserv-
ative effort. The reason for that is—it 
dates back decades now, back to the 
1970s. The reason for that is these reli-
gious conservatives are from different 
backgrounds, but what they have con-
sistently sought together was protec-
tion for their right to worship, for 
their right to freely exercise their 
faith, as the First Amendment guaran-
tees, for their right to gather in their 
communities, for their right to pursue 
the way of life that their scriptures 
variously command and that the Con-
stitution absolutely protects. That is 
what they have asked for, that is what 
they have sought all these years. 
Yet, as to those religious conserv-
atives, how do they fare in yesterday’s 
decision? What will this decision mean, 
this rewrite of Title VII? What will it 
mean for churches? What will it mean 
for religious schools? What will it 
mean for religious charities? 
Well, in the many pages of its opin-
ion—33 pages to be exact—the majority 
does finally get around to say some-
thing about religious liberty on one 
page. What does it say? Here is the sub-
stance of the Court’s analysis: How 
‘‘doctrines protecting religious liberty 
interact with Title VII,’’ as reinter-
preted now by the Court, ‘‘are ques-
tions for future cases.’’ Let’s have that 
again. How ‘‘doctrines protecting reli-
gious liberty interact with Title VII 
are questions for future cases.’’ No 
doubt they are huge questions. 
We eagerly await what our super-leg-
islators across the street in the Su-
preme Court building there at One 
First Street will legislate on this ques-
tion. What will become of church-hir-
ing liberty? What will become of the 
policies of religious schools? What will 
become of the fate of religious char-
ities? Who knows? Who is to say? They 
are questions for future cases. 
I will say this in defense of the Court: 
It is difficult to anticipate in one case 
all future possible implications. That 
is why courts are supposed to leave leg-
islating to legislators. That is why ar-
ticle III does not give the U.S. Supreme 
Court or any Federal court the power 
to legislate but only the judicial power 
to decide cases and controversies, not 
to decide policies. 
I will also say this: Everybody 
knows—every 
honest 
person 
knows 
that the laws in this country today are 
made almost entirely by unelected bu-
reaucrats and courts; they are not 
made by this body. Why not? Because 
this body doesn’t want to make law, 
that is why not. In order to make law, 
you have to take a vote. In order to 
vote, you have to be on the record, and 
to be on the record is to be held ac-
countable, and that is what this body 
fears above all else. This body is terri-
fied of being held accountable for any-
thing on any subject. So can we be sur-
prised that where the legislature fears 
to tread, where the article I body—this 
body that is charged by the Constitu-
tion for legislating—refuses to do its 
job, courts rush in and bureaucrats 
too? Are they accountable to the peo-
ple? No, not at all. Do we have any re-
source? Not really. What should we do? 
Now we must wait to see what the 
super-legislators will say about our 
rights in future cases. 
If this case makes anything clear, it 
is that the bargain that has been of-
fered to religious conservatives for 
years now is a bad one. It is time to re-
ject it. The bargain has never been nec-
essarily explicitly articulated, but reli-
gious conservatives know what it is. 
The bargain is that you go along with 
the party establishment, you support 
their policies and priorities—or at least 
keep your mouth shut about it—and in 
return, the establishment will put 
some judges on the bench who sup-
posedly will protect your constitu-
tional right to freedom of worship and 
freedom of exercise. That is what we 
have been told for years now. We were 
told that we are supposed to shut up 
while the party establishment focuses 
more on cutting taxes and handing out 
favors to corporations—multinational 
corporations that don’t share our val-
ues, that will not stand up for Amer-
ican principles, and that are only too 
happy to ship American jobs overseas. 
But we are supposed to say nothing 
about that. 
We are supposed to keep our mouths 
shut because maybe we will get a judge 
out of the deal. That was the implicit 
bargain. We are supposed to keep our 
mouths shut while the party establish-
ment opens borders and while the party 
establishment pursues ruinous trade 
policies. We are supposed to keep our 
mouths shut while those at the upper 
end of the income bracket get all of the 
attention while working families and 
college students and those who don’t 
want to go to college but can’t get a 
good job—they get what attention? 
Workers. Children. What about par-
ents looking for help with the cost of 
raising children; looking for help with 
the culture in which they have to raise 
children; looking for help with the 
communities, rebuilding the commu-
nities in which they must carry out 
their family life? What about college 
students trying to find an education 
that isn’t ruinously expensive and then 
trying to figure out some way to pay 
back that ruinous debt? What about 
those who don’t have a college degree 
and don’t want one but would like to 
get a good job? What about them? 
We are supposed to stay quiet about 
all of that and more because there will 
be pro-constitutional religious liberty 
judges—except that there aren’t; ex-
cept that these judges don’t follow the 
Constitution; except that these judges 
invoke textualism and originalism in 
order to reach their preferred outcome. 
I want to be clear. I am not person-
ally criticizing any Justice who joined 
the majority opinion or wrote it. I be-
lieve 100 percent that the Justice who 
principally 
offered 
this—Justice 
Gorsuch—and those who joined him are 
sincere and were writing to the best of 
their ability, reasoning to the best of 
their ability. Whatever else you might 
say about the opinion, it is not sloppily 
reasoned. I think they were doing what 
they thought was best and using all of 
the skills and gifts they have. 
I question how we got here. I ques-
tion how judges who hold to this phi-
losophy ended up on that bench. I ques-
tion the bargain that people of faith 
have been offered and asked to hold to 
for all of these years. 
The truth is, to those who have ob-
jected to my own questioning of judi-
cial nominees in this body, to those 
who said I was wrong to question 
judges who came before the Judiciary 
Committee, to those who chided me for 
asking tough questions even of nomi-
nees by a Republican President, to 
those who said I was slowing down the 
process and I was out of line, and to the 
supposedly conservative groups who 
threatened to buy television time in 
my own State to punish me for asking 
questions about conservative judges, I 
just have this to say: This is why I ask 
questions. This is why I won’t stop. 
And I wish some more people would ask 
some harder questions because this 
outcome is not acceptable, and the bar-
gain religious conservatives have been 
offered is not tenable. 
I would just say it is not the time for 
religious conservatives to shut up. We 
have done that for too long. It is time 
for religious conservatives to stand up 
and to speak out. It is time for reli-
gious conservatives to bring forward 
the best of our ideas on every policy af-
fecting this Nation. We should be out 
in the forefront leading on economics, 
on trade, on race, on class, on every 
subject that matters for what our 
Founders called the ‘‘general welfare’’ 
because we have a lot to offer, not just 
to protect our own rights but for the 
good of all of our fellow citizens. 
As religious believers, we know that 
serving our fellow citizens—whatever 
their religious faith or whatever their 
commitments may be—we know that 
serving them, aiding them, working for 
them is one of the signature ways we 
show a love of neighbor. It is time for 
religious conservatives to do that. It is 
time for religious conservatives to 
take the lead rather than being pushed 
to the back. It is time for religious 
conservatives to stand up and speak 
out rather than being told to sit down 
and shut up. 
I am confident that people of faith 
and good will all across this country 
are ready to do that and want to do

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.’S LETTER FROM 
BIRMINGHAM JAIL 
Mr. JONES. Madam President, one of 
the greatest indictments I believe ever 
written was written on scraps of paper 
in a lonely jail cell in Birmingham, 
AL, in 1963. The letter from a Bir-
mingham jail written by Dr. Martin 
Luther King is a call to action. 
Last year, for the first time in the 
history of this body, the entire letter 
was read on the Senate floor by three 
Republicans, three Democrats—a bipar-
tisan effort, a bipartisan reading of a 
letter that is so important, the words 
of which still resonate today. 
Today, we do it again. I am pleased 
that we have once again three Repub-
licans and three Democrats to take 
part in this historic reading. At this 
point, as we get to that letter, I would 
like to yield the floor to my friend 
from South Carolina, Senator SCOTT, 
for a special introduction for this im-
portant reading. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
South 
Carolina. 
Madam President, we are at a critical 
time in our Nation’s history. I think 
we can all sense the opportunity that 
is before us. Through the challenges of 
COVID and the death of George Floyd 
and its aftermath, we can affect real, 
lasting change. 
Perhaps the most famous line in Dr. 
King’s letter from Birmingham jail is 
‘‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to jus-
tice everywhere.’’ Let me say that one 
more time. ‘‘Injustice anywhere is a 
threat to justice everywhere.’’ More 
than at any time I can remember, peo-
ple of all ages and races are standing 
up together for the idea that Lady Jus-
tice must be blind. 
Although COVID has delayed this 
now-annual reading of Dr. King’s let-
ter, it has truly never been more im-
portant than it is right now. 
I want to thank all of my colleagues 
from both sides of the aisle for reading 
today and Senator JONES for putting 
this together again. 
Every time we hear them, the words 
of Dr. King teach us something new. I 
hope the Nation hears these words with 
an open mind and an open heart and we 
all come together unified for a bigger 
purpose. 
Senator JONES, let me close by say-
ing that the letter from the Bir-
mingham jail was a letter written to 
the clergy of the time. As Senator 
HAWLEY was speaking about the impor-
tance of standing up for our religious 
liberties, the one thing he said at the 
end was that we should stand up now 
for all the issues facing our Nation— 
the economic issues, the racial issues. 
I thought it important and appro-
priate that following that speech, you 
have the reading of the letter from the 
Birmingham jail to the leaders, the re-
ligious leaders, to become involved and 
engaged in this current struggle. That 
is how change comes to America. 
Thank you for leading this process. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, 
with me today is one of my colleagues 
from my office, Mr. Blain Callas. 
In the words of Dr. King’s letter from 
a Birmingham jail: 
APRIL 16, 1963. 
MY DEAR FELLOW CLERGYMEN: 
While confined here in the Birmingham 
city jail, I came across your recent state-
ment calling my present activities ‘‘unwise 
and untimely.’’ Seldom do I pause to answer 
criticism of my working ideas. If I sought to 
answer all of the criticisms that cross my 
desk, my secretaries would have little time 
for anything other than such correspondence 
in the course of a day, and I would have no 
time for constructive work. But since I feel 
you are men of genuine good will and that 
your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I will 
try to answer your statement in what I hope 
will be patient and reasonable terms. 
I think I should indicate why I am here in 
Birmingham, since you have been influenced 
by the view which argues against ‘‘outsiders 
coming in.’’ I have the honor of serving as 
president of the Southern Christian Leader-
ship Conference, an organization operating 
in every southern state, with headquarters 
in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty 
five 
affiliated 
organizations 
across 
the 
South, and one of them is the Alabama 
Christian Movement for Human Rights. Fre-
quently we share staff, educational and fi-
nancial resources with our affiliates. Several 
months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham 
asked us to be on call to engage in a non-
violent direct action program if such were 
deemed necessary. We readily consented, and 
when the hour came we lived up to our prom-
ise. So I, along with several members of my 
staff, am here because I was invited here. I 
am here because I have organizational ties 
here. 
But more basically, I am in Birmingham 
because injustice is here. Just as the proph-
ets of the eighth century B.C. left their vil-
lages and carried their ‘‘thus saith the Lord’’ 
far beyond the boundaries of their home 
towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his 
village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of 
Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco 
Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the 
gospel of freedom beyond my home town. 
Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the 
Macedonian call for aid. 
Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelat-
edness of all communities and states. I can-
not sit idly by in Atlanta and not be con-
cerned about what happens in Birmingham. 
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice ev-
erywhere. We are caught in an inescapable 
network of mutuality, tied in a single gar-
ment of destiny. Whatever affects one di-
rectly, affects all indirectly. Never again can 
we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 
‘‘outside agitator’’ idea. 
Anyone who lives inside the United States 
can never be considered an outsider any-
where within its bounds. 
Now, you deplore the demonstrations tak-
ing place in Birmingham. But your state-
ment, I am sorry to say, fails to express a 
similar concern for the conditions that 
brought about the demonstrations. I am sure 
that none of you would want to rest content 
with the superficial kind of social analysis 
that deals merely with effects and does not 
grapple with underlying causes. It is unfor-
tunate that demonstrations are taking place 
in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortu-
nate that the city’s white power structure 
left the [African-American] community with 
no alternative. 
In any nonviolent campaign there are four 
basic steps: collection of the facts to deter-
mine whether injustices exist; negotiation; 
self purification; and direct action. We have 
gone through all these steps in Birmingham. 
There can be no gainsaying the fact that ra-
cial injustice engulfs this community. Bir-
mingham is probably the most thoroughly 
segregated city in the United States. Its ugly 
record of brutality is widely known. [African 
Americans] have experienced grossly unjust 
treatment in the courts. There have been 
more unsolved bombings of [African-Amer-
ican] homes and churches in Birmingham 
than in any other city in the nation. These 
are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the 
basis of these conditions, [African-American] 
leaders sought to negotiate with the city fa-
thers. But the latter consistently refused to 
engage in good faith negotiation. 
Then, last September, came the op-
portunity to talk with leaders of Bir-
mingham’s economic community. In 
the course of the negotiations, certain 
promises were made by the mer-
chants—for example, to remove the 
stores’ humiliating racial signs. On the 
basis of these promises, the Reverend 
Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of 
the Alabama Christian Movement for 
Human Rights agreed to a moratorium 
on all demonstrations. As the weeks 
and months went by, we realized that 
we were the victims of a broken prom-
ise. A few signs, briefly removed, re-
turned; the others remained. As in so 
many past experiences, our hopes had 
been blasted, and the shadow of deep 
disappointment settled upon us. We 
had no alternative except to prepare 
for direct action, whereby we would 
present our very bodies as a means of 
laying our case before the conscience 
of the local and the national commu-
nity. Mindful of the difficulties in-
volved, we decided to undertake a proc-
ess of self purification. We began a se-
ries of workshops on nonviolence, and 
we repeatedly asked ourselves: ‘‘Are 
you able to accept the blows without 
retaliating?’’ ‘‘Are you able to endure 
the ordeal of jail?’’ 
We decided to schedule our direct action 
program for the Easter season, realizing that 
except for Christmas, this is the main shop-
ping period of the year. Knowing that a 
strong economic-withdrawal program would 
be the by product of direct action, we felt 
that this would be the best time to bring 
pressure to bear on the merchants for the 
needed change. 
Then it occurred to us that Birmingham’s 
mayoral election was coming up in March, 
and we speedily decided to postpone action 
until after election day. When we discovered 
that the Commissioner of Public Safety, Eu-
gene ‘‘Bull’’ Connor, had piled up enough 
votes to be in the run off, we decided again 
to postpone action until the day after the 
run off so that the demonstrations could not 
be used to cloud the issues. 
Like many others, we waited to see Mr. 
Connor defeated, and to this end, we endured

postponement after postponement. Having 
aided in this community need, we felt our di-
rect action program could be delayed no 
longer. 
The words of Dr. King. A letter from 
a Birmingham jail, April 16, 1963. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. JONES. Madam President, con-
tinuing reading the letter from Bir-
mingham jail: 
You may well ask: ‘‘Why direct action? 
Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn’t ne-
gotiation a better path?’’ You are quite right 
in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the 
very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent di-
rect action seeks to create such a crisis and 
foster such a tension that a community 
which has constantly refused to negotiate is 
forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to 
dramatize the issue that it can no longer be 
ignored. My citing the creation of tension as 
part of the work of the nonviolent resister 
may sound rather shocking. But I must con-
fess that I am not afraid of the word ‘‘ten-
sion.’’ I have earnestly opposed violent ten-
sion, but there is a type of constructive, non-
violent 
tension 
which 
is 
necessary 
for 
growth. Such as Socrates felt that it was 
necessary to create a tension in the mind so 
that individuals could rise from the bondage 
of myths and half truths to the unfettered 
realm of creative analysis and objective ap-
praisal, so must we see the need for non-
violent gadflies to create the kind of tension 
in society that will help men rise from the 
dark depths of prejudice and racism to the 
majestic heights of understanding and broth-
erhood. The purpose of our direct action pro-
gram is to create a situation so crisis packed 
that it will inevitably open the door to nego-
tiation. I therefore concur with you in your 
call for negotiation. Too long has our be-
loved Southland been bogged down in a trag-
ic effort to live in a monologue rather than 
dialogue. 
One of the basic points in your statement 
is that the action that I and my associates 
have taken in Birmingham is untimely. 
Some have asked: ‘‘Why didn’t you give the 
new city administration time to act?’’ The 
only answer that I can give to this query is 
that the new Birmingham administration 
must be prodded about as much as the out-
going one, before it will act. We are sadly 
mistaken if we feel that the election of Al-
bert Boutwell as mayor will bring the mil-
lennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell 
is a much more gentle person than Mr. Con-
nor, they are both segregationists, dedicated 
to the maintenance of the status quo. I have 
hoped that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable 
enough to see the futility of massive resist-
ance to desegregation. But he will not see 
this without pressure from devotees of civil 
rights. My friends, I must say to you that we 
have not made a single gain in civil rights 
without determined legal and nonviolent 
pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact 
that privileged groups seldom give up their 
privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see 
the moral light and voluntarily give up their 
unjust posture; but as Reinhold Niebuhr has 
reminded us, groups tend to be more im-
moral than individuals. 
We know through painful experience that 
freedom is never voluntarily given by the op-
pressor; it must be demanded by the op-
pressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a 
direct action campaign that was ‘‘well 
timed’’ in the view of those who have not 
suffered unduly from the disease of segrega-
tion. For years now I have heard the word 
‘‘Wait!’’ It rings in the ear of every Negro 
with piercing familiarity. This ‘‘Wait’’ has 
almost always meant ‘‘Never.’’ We must 
come to see, with one of our distinguished 
jurists, that ‘‘justice too long delayed is just 
denied.’’ 
We have waited for more than 340 years for 
our constitutional and God given rights. The 
nations of Asia and Africa are moving with 
jetlike speed toward gaining political inde-
pendence, but we still creep at horse and 
buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at 
a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those 
who have never felt the stinging darts of seg-
regation to say, ‘‘Wait.’’ But when you have 
seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and 
fathers at will and drown your sisters and 
brothers at whim; when you have seen hate 
filled policeman curse, kick and even kill 
your black brothers and sisters; when you 
see the vast majority of your twenty million 
Negro brothers smothering in an airtight 
cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent 
society . . . when you take a cross country 
drive and find it necessary to sleep, night 
after night, in the uncomfortable corners of 
your automobile because no motel will ac-
cept you; when you are humiliated day in 
and day out by nagging signs reading 
‘‘white’’ and ‘‘colored’’; when your first 
name becomes [an expletive], your middle 
named becomes ‘‘boy’’ (however old you are) 
and your last name becomes ‘‘John,’’ and 
your wife and mother are never given the re-
spected title ‘‘Mrs.’’; when you are harried 
by day and haunted by night by the fact that 
you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe 
stance, never quite knowing what to expect 
next, and are plagued with inner fears and 
outer resentments; when you are forever 
fighting 
a 
degenerating 
sense 
of 
‘‘nobodiness’’—then you will understand why 
we find it difficult to wait. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. ‘‘There comes a 
time when the cup of endurance runs 
over, and men are no longer willing to 
be plunged into the abyss of despair. I 
hope, sirs, you can understand our le-
gitimate and unavoidable impatience. 
You express a great deal of anxiety 
over our willingness to break laws. 
This is certainly a legitimate concern. 
Since we so diligently urge people to 
obey the Supreme Court’s decision of 
1954 outlawing segregation in the pub-
lic schools, at first glance it may seem 
rather paradoxical for us consciously 
to break laws. One may well ask: ‘How 
can you advocate breaking some laws 
and obeying others?’ The answer lies in 
the fact that there are two types of 
laws: Just and unjust. I would be the 
first to advocate obeying just laws. One 
has not only a legal but a moral re-
sponsibility to obey just laws. Con-
versely, one has a moral responsibility 
to disobey unjust laws. I would agree 
with St. Augustine that ‘an unjust law 
is no law at all.’’’ 
Now, what is the difference between the 
two? How does one determine whether a law 
is just or unjust? A just law is a man made 
code that squares with the moral law or the 
law of God. An unjust law is a code that is 
out of harmony with the moral law. To put 
it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An 
unjust law is a human law that is not rooted 
in eternal law and natural law. Any law that 
uplifts human personality is just. Any law 
that degrades human personality is unjust. 
All segregation statutes are unjust because 
segregation distorts the soul and damages 
the personality. It gives the segregator a 
false sense of superiority and the segregated 
a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to 
use the terminology of the Jewish philoso-
pher Martin Buber, substitutes an ‘‘I it’’ re-
lationship for an ‘‘I though’’ relationship and 
ends up relegating persons to the status of 
things. Hence, segregation is not only politi-
cally, economically and sociologically un-
sound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul 
Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not 
segregation an existential expression of 
man’s tragic separation, his awful estrange-
ment, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that 
I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of 
the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; 
and I can urge them to disobey segregation 
ordinances, for they are morally wrong. 
Let us consider a more concrete example of 
just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code 
that a numerical or a power majority group 
compels a minority group to obey but does 
not make binding on itself. This is difference 
made legal. By the same token, a just law is 
a code that a majority compels a minority to 
follow and that it is willing to follow itself. 
This is sameness made legal. Let me give an-
other explanation. A law is unjust if it is in-
flicted on a minority that, as a result of 
being denied the right to vote, had no part in 
enacting or devising the law. Who can say 
that the legislature of Alabama which set up 
that State’s segregation laws was democrat-
ically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts 
of devious methods are used to prevent Ne-
groes from becoming registered voters, and 
there are some counties in which, even 
though Negroes constitute a majority of the 
population, not a single Negro is registered. 
Can 
any 
law 
enacted 
under 
such 
cir-
cumstances be considered democratically 
structured? 
Sometimes a law is just on its face and un-
just in its application. For instance, I have 
been arrested on a charge of parading with-
out a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in 
having an ordinance which requires a permit 
for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes 
unjust when it is used to maintain segrega-
tion and to deny citizens the First Amend-
ment privilege of peaceful assembly and pro-
test. 
I hope you are able to see the distinction I 
am trying to point out. In no sense do I advo-
cate evading or defying the law, as would the 
rabid segregationist. That would lead to an-
archy. One who breaks an unjust law must 
do so openly, lovingly, and with a willing-
ness to accept the penalty. I submit that an 
individual who breaks a law that conscience 
tells him is unjust, and who willingly ac-
cepts the penalty of imprisonment in order 
to arouse the conscience of the community 
over its injustice, is in reality expressing the 
highest respect for the law. 
Of course, there is nothing new about this 
kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced 
sublimely 
in 
the 
refusal 
of 
Shadrach, 
Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of 
Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher 
moral law was at stake. It was practiced su-
perbly by the early Christians, who were 
willing to face hungry lions and the excru-
ciating pain of chopping blocks rather than 
submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman 
Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a 
reality today because Socrates practiced 
civil disobedience. In our own nation, the 
Boston Tea Party represented a massive act 
of civil disobedience. 
We should never forget that everything 
Adolf Hitler did in Germany was ‘‘legal’’ and 
everything the Hungarian freedom fighters 
did in Hungary was ‘‘illegal.’’ It was ‘‘ille-
gal’’ to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler’s 
Germany. Even so, I am sure that had I lived 
in Germany at the time, I would have aided 
and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today 
I lived in a Communist country where cer-
tain principles dear to the Christian faith

are suppressed, I would openly advocate dis-
obeying that country’s antireligious laws. 
I must make two honest confessions to 
you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. 
First, I must confess that over the past few 
years I have been gravely disappointed with 
the white moderate. 
I have almost reached the regrettable con-
clusion that the Negro’s great stumbling 
block in his stride toward freedom is not the 
White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux 
Klanner, but the white moderate, who is 
more devoted to ‘‘order’’ than to justice; who 
prefers a negative peace which is the absence 
of tension to a positive peace which is the 
presence of justice; who constantly says: ‘‘I 
agree with you in the goal you seek, but I 
cannot agree with your methods of direct ac-
tion’’; who paternalistically believes he can 
set the timetable for another man’s freedom; 
who lives by a mythical concept of time and 
who constantly advises the Negro to wait for 
a ‘‘more convenient season.’’ Shallow under-
standing from people of goodwill is more 
frustrating than absolute misunderstanding 
from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance 
is much more bewildering than outright re-
jection. 
I had hoped that the white moderate would 
understand that law and order exist for the 
purpose of establishing justice and that when 
they fail in this purpose they become the 
dangerously structured dams that block the 
flow of social progress. 
I had hoped that the white moderate would 
understand that the present tension in the 
South is a necessary phase of the transition 
from an obnoxious negative peace, in which 
the Negro passively accepted his unjust 
plight, to a substantive and positive peace, 
in which all men will respect the dignity and 
worth of human personality. Actually, we 
who engage in nonviolent direct action are 
not the creators of tension. We merely bring 
to the surface the hidden tension that is al-
ready alive. We bring it out in the open, 
where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a 
boil that can never be cured so long as it is 
covered up but must be opened with all its 
ugliness for the natural medicines of air and 
light, injustice must be exposed, with all the 
tension its exposure creates, to the light of 
human conscience and the air of national 
opinion before it can be cured. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, a let-
ter from Birmingham jail by Dr. Mar-
tin Luther, Jr.: 
In your statement you assert that our ac-
tions, even though peaceful, must be con-
demned because they precipitate violence. 
But is this a logical assertion? Isn’t this like 
condemning a robbed man because his pos-
session of money precipitated the evil act of 
robbery? Isn’t this like condemning Socrates 
because his unswerving commitment to 
truth and his philosophical inquiries precip-
itated the act by the misguided populace in 
which they made him drink hemlock? Isn’t 
this like condemning Jesus because his 
unique God consciousness and never ceasing 
devotion to God’s will precipitated the evil 
act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, 
as the federal courts have consistently af-
firmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to 
cease his efforts to gain his basic constitu-
tional rights because the quest may precipi-
tate violence. Society must protect the 
robbed and punish the robber. I had also 
hoped that the white moderate would reject 
the myth concerning time in relation to the 
struggle for freedom. I have just received a 
letter from a white brother in Texas. He 
writes: ‘‘All Christians know that the col-
ored people will receive equal rights eventu-
ally, but it is possible that you are in too 
great a religious hurry. It has taken Christi-
anity almost two thousand years to accom-
plish what it has. The teachings of Christ 
take time to come to earth.’’ Such an atti-
tude stems from a tragic misconception of 
time, from the strangely irrational notion 
that there is something in the very flow of 
time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actu-
ally, time itself is neutral; it can be used ei-
ther destructively or constructively. More 
and more I feel that the people of ill will 
have used time much more effectively than 
have the people of good will. We will have to 
repent in this generation not merely for the 
hateful words and actions of the bad people 
but for the appalling silence of the good peo-
ple. Human progress never rolls in on wheels 
of inevitability; it comes through the tire-
less efforts of men willing to be coworkers 
with God, and without this hard work, time 
itself becomes an ally of the forces of social 
stagnation. We must use time creatively, in 
the knowledge that the time is always ripe 
to do right. Now is the time to make real the 
promise of democracy and transform our 
pending national elegy into a creative psalm 
of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our 
national policy from the quicksand of racial 
injustice to the solid rock of human dignity. 
You speak of our activity in Birmingham 
as extreme. At first I was rather dis-
appointed that fellow clergymen would see 
my nonviolent efforts as those of an extrem-
ist. I began thinking about the fact that I 
stand in the middle of two opposing forces in 
the Negro community. One is a force of com-
placency, made up in part of Negroes who, as 
a result of long years of oppression, are so 
drained of self respect in the sense of 
‘‘somebodiness’’ that they have adjusted to 
segregation; and in part of a few middle-class 
Negroes who, because of a degree of aca-
demic and economic security and because in 
some ways they profit by segregation, have 
become insensitive to the problems of the 
masses. The other force is one of bitterness 
and hatred, and it comes perilously close to 
advocating violence. It is expressed in the 
various black nationalist groups that are 
springing up across the nation, the largest 
and best known being Elijah Muhammad’s 
Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro’s 
frustration over the continued existence of 
racial discrimination, this movement is 
made up of people who have lost faith in 
America, who have absolutely repudiated 
Christianity, and who have concluded that 
the white man is an incorrigible ‘‘devil.’’ 
I have tried to stand between these two 
forces, saying that we need emulate neither 
the ‘‘do nothingism’’ of the complacent nor 
the hatred and despair of the black nation-
alist. For there is the more excellent way of 
love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to 
God that, through the influence of the Negro 
church, the way of nonviolence became an 
integral part of our struggle. If this philos-
ophy had not emerged, by now many streets 
of the South would, I am convinced, be flow-
ing with blood. And I am further convinced 
that if our white brothers dismiss as ‘‘rabble 
rousers’’ and ‘‘outside agitators’’ those of us 
who employ nonviolent direct action, and if 
they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, 
millions of Negroes will, out of frustration 
and despair, seek solace and security in 
black nationalist ideologies—a development 
that would inevitably lead to a frightening 
racial nightmare. 
Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed 
forever. The yearning for freedom eventually 
manifests itself, and that is what has hap-
pened to the American Negro. Something 
within has reminded him of his birthright of 
freedom, and something without has re-
minded him that it can be gained. Con-
sciously or unconsciously, he has been 
caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his 
black brothers of Africa and his brown and 
yellow brothers of Asia, South America and 
the Caribbean, the United States Negro is 
moving with a sense of great urgency toward 
the promised land of racial justice. If one 
recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed 
the Negro community, one should readily 
understand why public demonstrations are 
taking place. The Negro has many pent up 
resentments and latent frustrations, and he 
must release them. So let him march; let 
him make prayer pilgrimages to the city 
hall; let him go on freedom rides—and try to 
understand why he must do so. If his re-
pressed emotions are not released in non-
violent ways, they will seek expression 
through violence; this is not a threat but a 
fact of history. 
So I have not said to my people: ‘‘Get rid 
of your discontent.’’ Rather, I have tried to 
say that this normal and healthy discontent 
can be channeled through into the creative 
outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now 
this approach is being termed extremist. But 
though I was initially disappointed at being 
categorized as an extremist, as I continued 
to think about the matter I gradually gained 
a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was 
not Jesus an extremist for love: ‘‘Love your 
enemies, bless them that curse you, do good 
to them that hate you, and pray for them 
which despitefully use you, and persecute 
you.’’ Was not Amos an extremist for justice: 
‘‘Let justice roll down like waters and right-
eousness like an ever flowing stream.’’ Was 
not Paul an extremist for the Christian gos-
pel: ‘‘I bear in my body the marks of the 
Lord Jesus.’’ Was not Martin Luther an ex-
tremist: ‘‘Here I stand; I cannot do other-
wise, so help me God.’’ And John Bunyan: ‘‘I 
will stay in jail to the end of my days before 
I make a butchery of my conscience.’’ And 
Abraham Lincoln: ‘‘This nation cannot sur-
vive half slave and half free.’’ And Thomas 
Jefferson: ‘‘We hold these truths to be self 
evident, that all men are created equal . . .’’ 
So the question is not whether we will be ex-
tremists, but what kind of extremists we will 
be. Will we be extremists for hate or for 
love? Will we be extremists for the preserva-
tion of injustice or for the extension of jus-
tice? In that dramatic scene on Calvary’s hill 
three men were crucified. We must never for-
get that all three were crucified for the same 
crime—the crime of extremism. Two were 
extremists for immorality, and thus fell 
below their environment. The other, Jesus 
Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and 
goodness, and thereby rose above his envi-
ronment. Perhaps the South, the nation and 
the world are in dire need of creative ex-
tremists. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I 
continue reading the letter from the 
Birmingham jail by Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr.: 
I had hoped the white moderate would see 
this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; per-
haps I expected too much. I suppose I should 
have realized that few members of the op-
pressor race can understand the deep groans 
and passionate yearnings of the oppressed 
race, and still fewer have the vision to see 
that injustice must be rooted out by strong, 
persistent and determined action. I am 
thankful, however, that some of our white 
brothers in the South have grasped the 
meaning of this social revolution and com-
mitted themselves to it. They are still all 
too few in quantity, but they are big in qual-
ity. Some—such as Ralph McGill, Lillian

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3003 
June 16, 2020 
Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, 
Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle—have 
written about our struggle in eloquent and 
prophetic terms. Others have marched with 
us down nameless streets of the South. They 
have languished in filthy, roach infested 
jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of po-
licemen 
who 
view 
them 
as 
‘‘dirty 
niggerlovers.’’ Unlike so many of their mod-
erate brothers and sisters, they have recog-
nized the urgency of the moment and sensed 
the need for powerful ‘‘action’’ antidotes to 
combat the disease of segregation. Let me 
take note of my other major disappointment. 
I have been so greatly disappointed with the 
white church and its leadership. Of course, 
there are some notable exceptions. I am not 
unmindful of the fact that each of you has 
taken some significant stands on this issue. 
I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your 
Christian stand on this past Sunday, in wel-
coming Negroes to your worship service on a 
nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic 
leaders of this state for integrating Spring 
Hill College several years ago. 
But despite these notable exceptions, I 
must honestly reiterate that I have been dis-
appointed with the church. I do not say this 
as one of those negative critics who can al-
ways find something wrong with the church. 
I say this as a minister of the gospel, who 
loves the church; who was nurtured in its 
bosom; who has been sustained by its spir-
itual blessings and who will remain true to it 
as long as the cord of life shall lengthen. 
When I was suddenly catapulted into the 
leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, 
Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be 
supported by the white church. I felt that 
the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the 
South would be among our strongest allies. 
Instead, some have been outright opponents, 
refusing to understand the freedom move-
ment and misrepresenting its leaders; all too 
many others have been more cautious than 
courageous and have remained silent behind 
the anesthetizing security of stained glass 
windows. In spite of my shattered dreams, I 
came to Birmingham with the hope that the 
white religious leadership of this community 
would see the justice of our cause and, with 
deep moral concern, would serve as the chan-
nel through which our just grievances could 
reach the power structure. I had hoped that 
each of you would understand. But again I 
have been disappointed. 
I have heard numerous southern religious 
leaders admonish their worshipers to comply 
with a desegregation decision because it is 
the law, but I have longed to hear white min-
isters declare: ‘‘Follow this decree because 
integration is morally right and because the 
Negro is your brother.’’ In the midst of bla-
tant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I 
have watched white churchmen stand on the 
sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and 
sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a 
mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial 
and economic injustice, I have heard many 
ministers say: ‘‘Those are social issues, with 
which the gospel has no real concern.’’ And I 
have watched many churches commit them-
selves to a completely other worldly religion 
which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinc-
tion between body and soul, between the sa-
cred and the secular. 
I have traveled the length and breadth of 
Alabama, Mississippi and all the other 
southern states. On sweltering summer days 
and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at 
the South’s beautiful churches with their 
lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have be-
held the impressive outlines of her massive 
religious education buildings. Over and over 
I have found myself asking: ‘‘What kind of 
people worship here? Who is their God? 
Where were their voices when the lips of 
Governor Barnett dripped with words of 
interposition and nullification? Where were 
they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion 
call for defiance and hatred? Where were 
their voices of support when bruised and 
weary Negro men and women decided to rise 
from the dark dungeons of complacency to 
the bright hills of creative protest?’’ 
Yes, these questions are still in my mind. 
In deep disappointment I have wept over the 
laxity of the church. But be assured that my 
tears have been tears of love. There can be 
no deep disappointment where there is not 
deep love. Yes, I love the church. How could 
I do otherwise? I am in the rather unique po-
sition of being the son, the grandson and the 
great grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the 
church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How 
we have blemished and scarred that body 
through social neglect and through fear of 
being nonconformists. 
There was a time when the church was 
very powerful—in the time when the early 
Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy 
to suffer for what they believed. In those 
days the church was not merely a thermom-
eter that recorded the ideas and principles of 
popular opinion; it was a thermostat that 
transformed the mores of society. Whenever 
the early Christians entered a town, the peo-
ple in power became disturbed and imme-
diately sought to convict the Christians for 
being ‘‘disturbers of the peace’’ and ‘‘outside 
agitators.’’ But the Christians pressed on, in 
the conviction that they were ‘‘a colony of 
heaven,’’ called to obey God rather than 
man. Small in number, they were big in com-
mitment. They were too God-intoxicated to 
be ‘‘astronomically intimidated.’’ By their 
effort and example they brought an end to 
such ancient evils as infanticide and glad-
iatorial contests. Things are different now. 
So often the contemporary church is a weak, 
ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So 
often it is an arch defender of the status quo. 
Far from being disturbed by the presence of 
the church, the power structure of the aver-
age community is consoled by the church’s 
silent—and often even vocal—sanction of 
things as they are. 
But the judgment of God is upon the 
church as never before. If today’s church 
does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of 
the early church, it will lose its authen-
ticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be 
dismissed as an irrelevant social club with 
no meaning for the twentieth century. Every 
day I meet young people whose disappoint-
ment with the church has turned into out-
right disgust. 
Perhaps I have once again been too opti-
mistic. Is organized religion too inextricably 
bound to the status quo to save our nation 
and the world? Perhaps I must turn my faith 
to the inner spiritual church, the church 
within the church, as the true ekklesia and 
the hope of the world. But again I am thank-
ful to God that some noble souls from the 
ranks of organized religion have broken 
loose from the paralyzing chains of con-
formity and joined us as active partners in 
the struggle for freedom. They have left 
their secure congregations and walked the 
streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They 
have gone down the highways of the South 
on tortuous rides for freedom. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, 
I continue with the reading of the let-
ter from Birmingham jail, Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. 
Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some 
have been dismissed from their churches, 
have lost the support of their bishops and 
fellow ministers. But they have acted in the 
faith that right defeated is stronger than 
evil triumphant. Their witness has been the 
spiritual salt that has preserved the true 
meaning of the gospel in these troubled 
times. 
They have carved a tunnel of hope through 
the dark mountain of disappointment. I hope 
the church as a whole will meet the chal-
lenge of this decisive hour. But even if the 
church does not come to the aid of justice, I 
have no despair about the future. I have no 
fear about the outcome of our struggle in 
Birmingham, even if our motives at present 
are misunderstood. We will reach the goal of 
freedom in Birmingham and all over the na-
tion, because the goal of America is freedom. 
Abused and scorned though we may be, our 
destiny is tied up with America’s destiny. 
Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we 
were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched 
the majestic words of the Declaration of 
Independence across the pages of history, we 
were here. For more than two centuries, our 
forebears labored in this country without 
wages; they made cotton king; they built the 
homes of their masters while suffering gross 
injustice and shameful humiliation—and yet 
out of a bottomless vitality they continued 
to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible 
cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the op-
position we now face will surely fail. We will 
win our freedom because the sacred heritage 
of our nation and the eternal will of God are 
embodied in our echoing demands. Before 
closing I feel impelled to mention one other 
point in your statement that has troubled 
me profoundly. You warmly commended the 
Birmingham police force for keeping ‘‘order’’ 
and ‘‘preventing violence.’’ I doubt that you 
would have so warmly commended the police 
force if you had seen its dogs sinking their 
teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I 
doubt that you would so quickly commend 
the policemen if you were to observe their 
ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes 
here in the city jail; if you were to watch 
them push and curse old Negro women and 
young Negro girls; if you were to see them 
slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; 
if you were to observe them, as they did on 
two occasions, refuse to give us food because 
we wanted to sing our grace together. I can-
not join you in your praise of the Bir-
mingham police department. 
It is true that the police have exercised a 
degree of discipline in handling the dem-
onstrators. In this sense they have con-
ducted themselves rather ‘‘nonviolently’’ in 
public. But for what purpose? To preserve 
the evil system of segregation. Over the past 
few years I have consistently preached that 
nonviolence demands that the means we use 
must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have 
tried to make it clear that it is wrong to use 
immoral means to attain moral ends. But 
now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or 
perhaps even more so, to use moral means to 
preserve immoral ends. Perhaps, Mr. Connor 
and his policemen had been rather non-
violent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in 
Albany, Georgia, but they have used the 
moral means of nonviolence to maintain the 
immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. El-
liot has said: ‘‘The last temptation is the 
greatest treason: To do the right deed for the 
wrong reason.’’ 
I wish you had commended the Negro sit 
inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for 
their sublime courage, their willingness to 
suffer, and their amazing discipline in the 
midst of great provocation. One day the 
South will recognize its real heroes. They 
will be the James Merediths, with the noble 
sense of purpose that enables them to face 
jeering and hostile mobs, and with the ago-
nizing loneliness that characterizes the life 
of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed 
battered Negro women symbolized in a sev-
enty two year old woman in Montgomery,

Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity 
and with her people decided not to ride seg-
regated buses, and who responded with 
ungrammatical profundity to one who in-
quired about her weariness: ‘‘My feets is 
tired, but my soul is at rest.’’ They will be 
the young high school and college students, 
the young ministers of the gospel and a host 
of 
their 
elders, 
courageously 
and 
non-
violently sitting in at lunch counters and 
willingly going to jail for conscience’ sake. 
One day the South will know that when 
these disinherited children of God sat down 
at lunch counters, they were in reality 
standing up for what is best in the American 
dream and for the most sacred values in our 
Judeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing 
our nation back to those great wells of de-
mocracy which were dug deep by the found-
ing founders in their formulation of the Con-
stitution and the Declaration of Independ-
ence. 
Never before have I written so long a let-
ter. I’m afraid it is much too long to take 
your precious time. I can assure you that it 
would have been much shorter if I had been 
writing from a comfortable desk, but what 
else can one do when he is alone in a narrow 
jail cell, other than write long letters, think 
long thoughts, and pray long prayers? 
If I have said anything in this letter that 
overstates the truth and indicates an unrea-
sonably impatience, I beg you to forgive me. 
If I have said anything that understates the 
truth and indicates my having a patience 
that allows me to settle for anything less 
than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me. 
I hope this letter finds you strong in the 
faith. I also hope that circumstances will 
soon make it possible for me to meet each of 
you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights 
leader but as a fellow clergymen and a Chris-
tian brother. Let us all hope that the dark 
clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away 
and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be 
lifted from our fear drenched communities, 
and in some not too distant tomorrow, the 
radiant stars of love and brotherhood will 
shine over our great nation with all their 
scintillating beauty. 
Yours for the cause of Peace and Brother-
hood, 
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I want to 
first thank my colleagues who joined 
me today. 
As Senator SCOTT said, we had hoped 
to do this in April on the anniversary 
of the writing of this letter. Unfortu-
nately, the pandemic overtook us. But, 
as Senator SCOTT said, I don’t think 
the timing could be any better than 
today. 
Just as last year when we did this, I 
am sure that each of my colleagues 
today will leave the floor with an even 
greater appreciation of Dr. King’s leg-
acy and I hope a better understanding 
of where America finds itself today. 
When we think of Dr. King, we usu-
ally see him on the steps of the Lincoln 
Memorial eloquently and passionately 
describing his dream for America or be-
hind a pulpit in Memphis urging his au-
dience to press forward, to not be dis-
couraged in their quest for civil and 
equal rights because he had been to the 
mountaintop and he had seen the 
Promise Land. 
It is, frankly, somewhat astounding 
to read his thoughts that were read on 
the floor today and picture him in a 
small, 
dirty 
jail 
cell, 
writing 
in 
longhand on napkins and scraps of 
paper and newspaper to a group of min-
isters who were not hateful as much as 
they were questioning the need for ac-
tion at that particular moment in 1963. 
There are some who would say that, 
to share my thoughts on our situation 
today, I need to move beyond a letter 
written in 1963, beyond a call of action 
so long ago. Certainly, it is true that 
there are more contemporary voices 
and writings that explain how we 
should see our times and what actions 
are needed today, now and in the 
present. After all, although it was un-
certain in the spring of 1963, Dr. King, 
in a movement, would go on to achieve 
historic changes with the signing of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, and so many other 
legislative victories. 
But I believe we are at a similar mo-
ment today, in this time, in this place, 
and that Dr. King’s words are as con-
temporary as they are powerful. You 
see, in 1963, Alabama had become the 
focal point of the racism and division 
and hatred that existed throughout our 
Nation. Bombings and fires in Black 
neighborhoods were commonplace; sus-
pects never apprehended; a Governor 
promising segregation now, segrega-
tion tomorrow, segregation forever; 
Bull Connor shocking the Nation when 
he unleashed vicious police dogs and 
firehoses on innocent children engaged 
in a peaceful protest; and later in that 
year, a church bombing that killed four 
young girls simply because of the color 
of their skin. 
The question on the day Dr. King was 
arrested was, Why now? Why the risk 
of jail and perhaps death to protest 
conditions in a city that Dr. King had 
described as the most segregated in 
America—a city, though, that had just 
elected a new city government that 
had promised change? It is a question 
Dr. King and all Black Americans had 
heard for too long, and it was time for 
an answer. 
I believe the wisdom of this letter is 
perhaps the best frame to view how we 
move forward during this moment, the 
movement of this time, the movement 
of this generation. In passage after pas-
sage, Dr. King warns us how easily peo-
ple can fall back to accepting the sta-
tus quo, how easily people can hear the 
word ‘‘wait’’ when, in fact, the word 
means ‘‘never.’’ 
From a jail cell in Birmingham in 
1963, Dr. King told us that action in 
that moment was critical so that 
issues 
of 
racism 
and 
inequality 
throughout the land would no longer be 
ignored. And here we are, 57 years 
later—57 years later—and his words are 
still just as timely. The action in this 
moment, our moment, is likewise crit-
ical so that issues of systemic racism 
and inequality can finally be erased. 
While so many seem to be heeding 
Dr. King’s call for action—across the 
country, we see it time and again: hun-
dreds, if not thousands, of people heed-
ing Dr. King’s call for action today— 
my greatest fear at this moment, quite 
frankly, is that so many people who 
have felt powerless or unaffected who 
are willing to march and speak out, 
ready to change the fairness of our 
laws and society—my greatest concern 
is that these good people will get dis-
tracted. It is easy to be overwhelmed 
by the magnitude of the problem. It is 
understandable to not know where to 
begin. But it is not enough to simply 
agree any longer, to simply have a con-
versation. 
Remember, Dr. King confesses to the 
ministers to whom he is responding 
that he has been gravely disappointed 
with what he terms, in 1963, the ‘‘White 
model.’’ 
If a conversation is all that comes 
from the moment we are in, then our 
society will have lost the greatest 
chance of our lifetime to remedy 
wrongs that have compounded for cen-
turies. 
It is time for both our institutions 
and our society to meaningfully re-
verse 
the 
degenerating 
sense 
of 
nobodiness. 
In this moment, we have a critical 
mass of society that understands the 
legitimate and unavoidable patience of 
which Dr. King spoke. The last few 
months have made the truths of being 
Black in America clear to all. 
We have watched somewhat help-
lessly as a pandemic killed Black peo-
ple at the rate of almost 21⁄2 times that 
of other Americans, not from a muta-
tion of the virus but from an under-
funded health system that too often de-
prives Black Americans care for diabe-
tes, heart disease, and other health 
issues that are now described as pre-
existing conditions. 
We have watched an economic toll as 
Black-owned businesses failed at twice 
the rate of others, and unemployment 
for Black Americans grows faster and 
will stay higher than those of the rest 
of America. 
Of course, through this pandemic, we 
have also seen the heroes: Black work-
ers delivering packages, stocking gro-
cery stores, and serving on frontlines 
in hospitals and as first responders. 
But the economic reality of being 
Black in America remains a sin of our 
Nation. 
There have certainly been many 
Black Americans who have pushed 
through a system weighted against 
them to prosper, to find the American 
dream. We celebrate those folks but 
must face the fact that discrimination 
and institutional racism push much 
too hard against the health, education, 
job opportunities, and financial secu-
rity of those whom this Government of 
the United States of America once 
counted as only three-fifths of a per-
son. 
Then, while in the course of this pan-
demic, as we were seeing the truths of 
this system and society that have been 
easy to pretend did not really exist, on 
our screens came a video of a Black 
man being killed with the knee of a po-
lice officer on the back of his neck.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3005 
June 16, 2020 
The image of George Floyd on the 
ground—as low as one could possibly, 
physically get in life—with the knee of 
a 
police 
officer—an 
agent 
of 
the 
State—on his neck, keeping him on the 
ground, was far more than just an 
image of the legalities of a violation of 
George Floyd’s civil rights and the 
color of law; it was an image of a soci-
ety and a culture that keep the knee 
on the necks of Black Americans 
through systemic racism and discrimi-
nation. 
George Floyd’s cries of ‘‘I can’t 
breathe’’ were not just the cries of an 
innocent man pleading for his life but 
the cries of so many of our fellow 
Americans 
who 
are 
choked 
by 
healthcare systems that deny them ac-
cess 
to 
quality 
and 
affordable 
healthcare; who are, in Dr. King’s 
words, ‘‘smothering in an airtight cage 
of poverty,’’; who can’t breathe the 
fresh air of affordable housing, edu-
cation, and economic opportunities; or 
who simply have to hold their own 
breath when they or their sons or their 
daughters venture away from their 
home, fearing a police encounter that 
will take their life. 
Perhaps even more than the dogs and 
the firehoses in Birmingham or the 
State trooper beatings on the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL, the video 
of George Floyd’s last moments on 
Earth was a confluence of events that 
gave our Nation an image of itself that 
it could no longer bear. 
I truly—I truly and fully believe that 
the soul of America has come to the 
streets of America looking for a way 
for all of her people to live in a more 
just society; that we are at a time 
when what I have called a crisis 
trifecta of health, economic, and in-
equality has resulted in a careful ex-
amination and introspection of our be-
liefs and our priorities about race and 
about poverty; that we have come to 
understand more than at any time in 
the history of our country that what-
ever affects one directly affects all in-
directly. 
Standing on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate, though, I know that this moment 
requires more than introspection on 
our part. We in this body and in gov-
ernment as a whole have the power to 
effect actual change. To not do so with 
speed would be forever unpardonable. 
As a person, as an individual, as a 
citizen of the United States, I know 
that I must, like everyone in this coun-
try, open my heart and my mind to lis-
ten with concern and empathy and to 
act as an individual. But I also know 
that as a U.S. Senator, I am ready to 
act, freely admitting that I might not 
have the ideal solution or all of the an-
swers but not letting the theoretical 
perfect be the enemy of tangible 
change that we must see, not asking 
our citizens to wait any longer than 
they already have. 
As a body, we have acted before, and 
we should act again. To that end, we 
are seeing proposals for law enforce-
ment reform from the administration, 
from congressional leaders on both 
sides of the political aisle, and in both 
Houses of the U.S. Congress. I am hope-
ful—even optimistic—that we can find 
the 
common 
ground 
necessary 
to 
achieve meaningful reform, but we will 
need to do more for this country. 
As Dr. King reminds us, sometimes a 
law is just on its face and unjust in its 
application. I would add to that that a 
law that seemed to hold such promise 
at one time can be eroded to the point 
where it becomes unjust. 
To that end, I respectfully submit 
that we should review the Voting 
Rights Act to make sure that easy suc-
cess at the ballot box is a reality, espe-
cially in the midst of a healthcare cri-
sis. We should examine existing laws 
and practices in education to make 
sure everyone has equal access to a 
quality education. We should examine 
existing laws to ensure that everyone 
has equal economic opportunities, in-
cluding protections from employment 
discrimination. 
To that extent, I should add that, 
with the historic Supreme Court deci-
sion yesterday—one which I applaud, 
even though some in this body may 
not—we should immediately bring the 
Equality Act to the floor of the Senate 
and affirm our commitment to ending 
discrimination in the workplace in any 
form, against any individual. 
We should examine again existing 
laws that continue to deny quality, af-
fordable healthcare to poor and low-in-
come 
households, 
including 
giving 
States like Alabama the incentives 
necessary to expand Medicaid to get 
those Federal dollars to help lift those 
individuals who not only struggled be-
fore this pandemic but have lost their 
healthcare during this pandemic. 
We need to examine laws like the 
Fair Housing Act, signed only a week 
after Dr. King’s assassination, in order 
to ensure that that act fulfills the 
promise upon which it was enacted. 
We spend billions of dollars each year 
to perpetuate housing that keeps peo-
ple without means, especially Black 
families, trapped in places where it is 
difficult to access education, healthy 
food, and economic opportunities. Un-
fortunately, all signs are pointing to a 
worsening housing crisis because of the 
pandemic. 
As a people and as a Congress, we 
cannot let this moment pass. By saying 
that, I mean more than just passing re-
forms. Surely reforms are needed, but 
the greater need is not just to reform 
but to transform, to make a dramatic 
change in the nature and character of 
our institutions and our culture toward 
a more just government and society. 
To that end, as we focus on heeding 
Dr. King’s call to action written in 
1963, we should also remember his 
words written just 3 years after the 
passage of the Civil Rights Act and 2 
years after the passage of the Voting 
Rights Act. In his 1967 final book 
‘‘Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos Or 
Community?’’ Dr. King wrote: 
[America] has been sincere and even ardent 
in welcoming some change. But too quickly 
apathy and disinterest rise to the surface 
when the next logical steps are to be taken. 
Laws are passed in a crisis mood after a Bir-
mingham or a Selma, but no substantial fer-
vor survives the formal signing of legisla-
tion. The recording of the law in itself is 
treated as the reality of the reform. 
The point is simply, but signifi-
cantly, to those of you who have suf-
fered long for equality and for oppor-
tunity: Keep this moment alive. Keep 
it alive beyond the crisis mood we find 
ourselves in today by continuing to en-
gage those who have more recently 
seen your plight through new eyes. De-
mand that we not just meet this mo-
ment with more division, intolerance, 
and anger at one another that pulls us 
farther apart and deeper into chaos 
where we have failed to heal. That can-
not be America’s future. 
Demand that it not be, as Dr. King’s 
letter warned, simply a moment for an-
other conversation that makes it sound 
like something is changing but it never 
does. 
The path from the first slave ship to 
land on these shores, to the lone, bar-
ren jail cell in Birmingham, AL, where 
Dr. King wrote his letter that we read 
today, to the deaths of George Floyd 
and Breonna Taylor and Rayshard 
Brooks—that path is a long one—too 
long. It is a path of a multigenera-
tional failure to be the America of our 
ideals, where the Civil War is actually 
over and we are truly one Nation, with 
liberty and justice for all. 
I will tell you, as a son of the South— 
the Deep South—that we should not 
lose this moment. We in the South 
have been at the center of this divide 
for too long, and we can be at the cen-
ter of healing it and leading the Nation 
to a more just society. 
Since our country’s inception, we 
have said the words: ‘‘All are created 
equal.’’ We have pledged that we are a 
nation with justice for all—all, not 
some—all. But we know that we have 
never lived up to that ideal. We all 
know it. 
In response to many of the protests 
that are taking place across this coun-
try today, where voices and T-shirts 
and face masks proclaim that ‘‘Black 
lives matter,’’ some insist on saying 
that ‘‘all lives matter.’’ Of course they 
do, but we will not be a country where 
we are all truly equal and where justice 
is for all until we can all say the words 
‘‘Black lives matter’’ and mean it. 
We have to mean it now. All of us 
must reject the voices of hatred and in-
tolerance and division. All of us must 
embrace taking action to root out in-
justice and to seek justice and oppor-
tunity for all. The road to racial jus-
tice in America has taken far too long, 
but it is a path we must walk together 
if we are to reach the mountaintop. 
To my colleagues, I say: Join me and 
others. To the people of Alabama and 
our Nation I say: Join together. 
It is time, America. It is time. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Texas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3006 
June 16, 2020 
I have had the opportunity to join the 
Senator from Alabama, coming to-
gether with a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators to read Dr. King’s letter from the 
Birmingham jail. 
I want to thank the Senator from 
Alabama for his leadership and bring-
ing this group together. I have read 
that letter many times before, but I 
had never read it out loud. I had never 
heard the words spoken, much less 
heard them spoken in this historic 
Chamber. 
I think today is a time when every 
American should listen to those words. 
Today is a time that every American 
should look back at the incredible call 
to justice that Dr. King gave us. 
This is a time where our Nation is 
grieving. This is a time where there is 
anger, division, rage. This is a time 
where our country is divided on racial 
lines in a way it hasn’t been in a long, 
long time. This is a time where we need 
to hear a call to unity—a call to unity 
and a call to justice. Dr. King’s call 
was powerful for both, for unity and for 
justice. 
I would like to just briefly make 
three observations about this historic 
letter. The first is that this was a let-
ter from a pastor written to pastors. 
We refer to Dr. King as ‘‘Dr. King,’’ and 
it is easy to forget that he was also 
Reverend King. He was a Christian 
minister who preached the Gospel. 
The very first words of this letter are 
‘‘My Dear Fellow Clergymen.’’ That is 
to whom this was addressed, the lead-
ers in the church, where he had a mes-
sage of get off your rear ends and stand 
for justice. 
If you are a person of faith, then, jus-
tice, defeating racial discrimination, 
defeating bigotry is not just a matter 
of truth, but it is a matter of morality. 
Here is what Dr. King said about it in 
the opening paragraphs of the letter: ‘‘I 
am in Birmingham because injustice is 
here.’’ 
Understand how much this was a call 
to church leaders. He says: ‘‘Just as the 
prophets of the eighth century B.C. left 
their villages and carried’’. . . . their 
message. . . . ‘‘just as the Apostle Paul 
left his village of Tarsus and carried 
the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far 
corners of the Greco Roman world, so 
am I compelled to carry the gospel of 
freedom beyond my own home town.’’ 
At a time when our Nation is griev-
ing, is in anguish, is in anger, is in di-
vision, Dr. King’s—Reverend King’s— 
message to church leaders to stand up 
for justice, to stand up for truth reso-
nates clear as a bell today. 
As a second observation, Dr. King, in 
this letter and throughout his min-
istry, throughout his public leadership, 
called over and over and over to resist 
violence. Against the voices of those 
who agreed with him about the injus-
tices, he was calling out where he said 
violence is not the way. 
As we have seen rioting in our cities, 
as we have seen small businesses 
burned to the ground, as we have seen 
police officers assaulted and wounded 
and murdered in violent and angry pro-
tests and riots and looting, the words 
of Dr. King calling out to resist vio-
lence and to speak for justice—those 
words—should be heard by all of us. 
A third observation, in calling for 
justice, Dr. King appealed to our found-
ing principles. There are some, particu-
larly young people, today, who are 
angry, who are being peddled, I think, 
what is a bill of goods—a lie—that 
America is fundamentally unjust, that 
it is an evil society built upon racism. 
That is simply not true. Is there evil 
in the world? Yes. Is there racism in 
the world? Yes. Is there oppression in 
the world? Yes. Is all of that present in 
the United States? Absolutely. 
But Dr. King, in this letter, didn’t en-
deavor to tear down the foundations of 
our Nation. Instead, he made an ex-
plicit appeal that the promises this Na-
tion was founded upon—the promises of 
freedom, the promises of equality—we 
have not yet fully achieved that, but 
we can. 
That is the beauty of this American 
experiment. We are a nation founded 
on the proposition that all men are cre-
ated equal, even though our history 
has been troubled in achieving that ob-
jective. 
So I thank my colleagues, both Re-
publicans and Democrats, who came 
today to reread this letter. We need to 
hear these words. We need to hear this 
message. We need to stand for justice 
and stand for unity. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 
there is a reason why 800 conservation 
organizations, every U.S. Secretary of 
Interior from Babbitt to Zinke, and the 
President of the United States, Presi-
dent Trump, support the legislation we 
are going to be voting on at about noon 
tomorrow, and that is because, in my 
view and in the view of many others, it 
is the most important piece of con-
servation legislation this country will 
have passed in at least half a century. 
And why is that? It is because it takes 
nearly $14 billion—up to $14 billion— 
over the next 5 years from energy ex-
ploration on our public lands and 
spends it to cut in half the deferred 
maintenance backlog in our national 
parks, our national forests, and our na-
tional refuges, and also to rebuild In-
dian schools. 
In addition to that, it does something 
that Congress has been trying to do for 
60 years, since the midsixties. It per-
manently funds the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, which supplies to 
both the Federal Government and 
States money to create national parks 
and routes to fishing access and to 
other places in the country that we all 
treasure. 
In the middle of the Great Depression 
in the 1930s, the people of eastern Ten-
nessee and western North Carolina 
looked around and said: Why are all 
the national parks out West? Well, it 
was because the Federal Government 
owned a lot of the land out West and 
carved a bunch of it up to make na-
tional parks—Yellowstone, Yosemite, 
Grand Canyon, and other places that 
we know. So they looked around the 
United States in the east and said: 
Where can we have a national park? 
And they settled on the Great Smoky 
Mountains. So they created a park that 
is half in Tennessee and half in North 
Carolina. It wasn’t easy to do in the 
midst of the Great Depression. 
Governor Austin Peay of Tennessee 
brought the legislature—mostly Demo-
crats—to Republican East Tennessee 
twice by train to see this 500,000 acres 
of 
land. 
The 
State 
of 
Tennessee 
couldn’t come up with enough money 
to buy it, and neither could North 
Carolina. Then John D. Rockefeller, 
Jr., offered $5 million in honor of his 
mother, Laura Spelman Rockefeller, if 
anybody would match it. So the State 
legislatures in both States—Tennessee 
and North Carolina—appropriated $2 
million each, and then the remaining 
million was raised by public subscrip-
tion—schoolchildren, teachers. People 
all over the region raised the money, 
and that $10 million bought 500,000 
acres that today is visited by 12 million 
Americans every year. It is by far the 
most visited national park, attracting 
two, three—four times as many visitors 
as many of our most popular western 
parks because it is located in the east 
and because it has the highest moun-
tains in the east. 
But here is the problem with the 
Great 
Smoky 
Mountains 
National 
Park: The 12 million visitors a year are 
about to use it up. Too many of the 800- 
plus miles of trails are worn, so when 
you walk on them, you stumble. Too 
many of the roads are potholed. Too 
many of the roofs leak. 
There is one campground that I can 
see 
from 
my 
house 
almost 
on 
Chilhowee Mountain at the edge of the 
park called the Look Rock Camp-
ground that has been closed for 5 or 6 
years because the sewage system won’t 
work—5,000 families want to go up 
there and can’t, and the sewage system 
won’t work. Obviously these aren’t just 
Tennessee families; they are from all 
over the country. We have 6 or 7 mil-
lion people living in Tennessee. We 
have 14 million visitors a year. 
So what this bill does is it says to the 
Great Smoky Mountains: All right. 
You have $224 million of deferred main-
tenance—of potholes, of worn trails, of 
sewage systems, of leaky roofs—$224 
million. Your operating budget is only 
$20 million a year. This deferred main-
tenance is 10 to 12 times the amount of 
your operating budget. It will never get 
done. It will never get done without a 
bill like this or this bill, which will say 
to the Smokies and to the National 
Mall and to the Pearl Harbor Visitor 
Center and to the Grand Canyon and to 
all 419 of our national parks: We are 
going to cut half of the $12 billion de-
ferred maintenance bill—we are going 
to cut half of that out over the next 5 
years, and we are going to take money

from energy exploration on public 
lands and use some of it for that. 
Not just our national parks, Presi-
dent Trump agreed—in fact, I talked to 
him about it on his trip to Tennessee 
when he came to visit after the torna-
does. 
I said: Mr. President, the sponsors of 
our bill, Democrats and Republicans, 
would like to add to the bill our other 
public lands. We would like to add the 
national forests. 
The Cherokee National Forest, for 
example, is in Tennessee and North 
Carolina. It is even bigger than the 
Smokies. It has 3 million visitors a 
year. It also has about $27 million of 
deferred maintenance. It will never be 
able to do that without this bill or 
something like it. 
I said: How about our wildlife ref-
uges, Mr. President? We have the Ten-
nessee Wildlife Refuge. It has $8 mil-
lion in deferred maintenance. It won’t 
be able to get the boat ramps right so 
people can go fishing over by Kentucky 
Lake. 
The President said: I will support it. 
Put it in if the Democrats and Repub-
licans cosponsoring the bill want it in 
there. 
Because he did, it is in there. 
It is in there just like the House of 
Representatives brought the bill out of 
its committee—it had those public 
lands in there. We didn’t when it came 
out of our committee. It had the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund in the 
House, just as we did when it came out. 
Let’s talk about the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund for a minute. That 
was supposed to be $900 million a year 
from oil and gas revenues that are 
spent by the Federal Government and 
by State governments to buy treasured 
lands. 
The Senator from Montana, Senator 
DAINES, says that in his State, 80 per-
cent of the fishing accesses have been 
purchased by the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. 
In my State, the Governor opened a 
new park, Rocky Fork, a magnificent 
place in Upper East Tennessee, much of 
it purchased by Land and Water Con-
servation Fund money—$221 million 
into Tennessee since 1964. 
But that is not as much as it was 
supposed to be because when this was 
enacted by Congress in 1964, at the rec-
ommendation of the Rockefeller Com-
mission—the first outdoor recreation 
review commission—it was supposed to 
be $900 million a year. Environmental 
burden—that is the oil and gas drilling; 
environmental benefit—that is the pur-
chase of conservation land. The money 
gets credited over in the Treasury De-
partment, but it doesn’t get spent 
every year. This changes that. 
This is not just an idea of the Law-
rence Rockefeller Commission in the 
sixties. In 1985 and 1986, President 
Reagan appointed the President’s Com-
mission on Americans Outdoors. I 
chaired that Commission, and the No. 1 
recommendation of the Commission 
was permanent funding for the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. 
So since the midsixties, good people 
in this body and good people outside of 
this body have been working to make 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
permanent and haven’t been able to do 
that, but now we can. 
Now let’s talk about the money for a 
minute. 
Senator PORTMAN, a former director 
of the budget office, points out that we 
are spending real money to reduce an 
unpaid debt. This isn’t like just adding 
to the budget, which we do sometimes 
without paying for it. This is real 
money. If we don’t produce enough oil 
this year—and last year we produced 
about 11.6 billion by selling energy pro-
duced on our public lands—if we don’t 
produce the money, we don’t spend it. 
Some have objected that it is manda-
tory and not paid for. That is a dif-
ference of opinion. The Office of Man-
agement and Budget has approved it, 
and the President’s budget has ap-
proved it. I think it is paid for because 
it is real money to reduce unpaid debt. 
For example, we take some of the 
money from energy exploration, and if 
you live in Wyoming, you get 50 per-
cent of it right off the top. If you live 
in Alaska, you get 90 percent right off 
the top. If you live in Louisiana, you 
get 271⁄2 percent, or in any other coast-
al State, or you might get 371⁄2 percent 
from another area. All that money is 
mandatory in the sense that it has to 
be paid to those States every year. We 
are just taking some of that kind of 
money out of that pot, after the others 
have been paid, and spending it for this 
purpose. 
This would not have happened if it 
weren’t for an unusual group of Sen-
ators who worked on this for a long 
time: Senators BURR and CANTWELL; 
Senators 
GARDNER, 
MANCHIN, 
and 
DAINES on the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund; and then on the parks, 
Senator 
WARNER
and 
Senator 
PORTMAN, who went to work early. 
Secretary Zinke came to see me in 
Tennessee 3 years ago and asked me to 
work on the parks bill, and I was de-
lighted to find, when Senators KING 
and HEINRICH and I began working on 
it, that there were a number of us with 
the same idea. 
As I mentioned, President Trump has 
been behind it from the beginning and 
behind the expansion of it, and he is 
the first President that has allowed us 
to use money from energy exploration 
for this purpose, and he should deserve 
credit for that. 
Senator MCCONNELL deserves credit. 
He has a lot that he could put on the 
floor, and he put this bill on the floor 
for 2 weeks. Only the majority leader 
can do that, and he did it. 
I am grateful to Senator SCHUMER 
and the Democratic leadership for cre-
ating an environment in which we 
could pass this bill in a bipartisan way. 
It is said that if you want to pass a 
big piece of legislation in the U.S. Sen-
ate, you need three things. One is that 
it is an important objective that is 
good for the country. One is good rela-
tionships among the sponsoring Sen-
ators. And one is a superior staff. We 
have had all three of those, and I would 
like to place into the RECORD—or I 
think I will read them—the names of 
some of the staff members who have 
been so helpful to us: Curtis Swager 
and Jennifer Loraine of Senator GARD-
NER’s office; Jason Thielman, Joshua 
Sizemore, and Holly Hinojosa of Sen-
ator DAINES’ office; Lance West, David 
Brooks, and Renae Black of Senator 
MANCHIN’s office; Pam Thiessen and 
Sarah Peery of Senator PORTMAN’s of-
fice; Elizabeth Falcone and Micah 
Barbour of Senator WARNER’s office; 
David Cleary, Lindsay Garcia, Allison 
Martin, and Anna Newton of my staff; 
Chad Metzler, Morgan Cashwell, and 
Kate Durost of Senator KING’s office; 
Amit Ronen of Senator CANTWELL’s of-
fice; 
Maya 
Hermann 
and 
Virgilio 
Barrera of Senator HEINRICH’s office. 
We thank them for their work. 
And then there are the advocates. 
Not many bills have more than 800 
groups in its support. It is quite a coa-
lition when you get President Trump 
and virtually all of the conservation, 
sportsmen, angler, and environmental 
groups behind the same bill. We owe all 
of them thanks for that. Sally Jewell, 
the former Secretary of the Interior, 
has been at the forefront of much of 
that. We hope that once this passes the 
Senate tomorrow with a big vote, they 
will carry it across the finish line in 
the House of Representatives. 
The Federal Government is not al-
ways the most popular entity in the 
United States, but sometimes we are. 
When our military keeps our country 
safe, we are grateful for that. When the 
National Institutes of Health creates 
medical miracles, we are grateful for 
that. We are grateful when the Federal 
Government creates 419 properties— 
from the National Mall to Pearl Har-
bor, to the Grand Canyon, to the Great 
Smokies—for us to enjoy and preserve. 
England has its history, Italy has its 
art, and Egypt has its pyramids. But 
the United States of America has the 
great American outdoors. It is an es-
sential part of the American character, 
and the Great American Outdoors Act 
is an essential part of being good stew-
ards of what Ken Burns has called our 
best idea, so that the next generation 
can enjoy the outdoors as this genera-
tion has been privileged to do. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). The Senator from Lou-
isiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
rise to speak about the Great American 
Outdoors Act or, more particularly, 
about the absence of a coastal resil-
iency amendment that I wish to have 
included. 
Let me begin by congratulating Sen-
ators 
CORY
GARDNER
and 
STEVE 
DAINES, from Colorado and Montana, 
respectively, of their pending success 
in passing the Great American Out-
doors Act. It takes lots of work to 
build enough support to get legislation

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

June 16, 2020 
to this floor for a vote, and even more 
to see that it passes. The people of 
Montana and Colorado should be proud 
of how their Senators fought and deliv-
ered billions to restore their national 
parks. I commend my colleagues. 
Those who have followed the debate 
know that I have opposed the bill as 
written. National parks are national 
treasures, but what led to my opposi-
tion is, I believe, that the Senate had 
the opportunity to help the more than 
135 million Americans who live in a 
coastal parish or county by concomi-
tantly funding flood mitigation and 
coastal resiliency projects. I fought 
hard to include a provision that would 
have invested in the coast to fortify 
against hurricanes and other cata-
strophic 
flooding 
events. 
Funding 
coastal resiliency would have passed as 
part of this legislation. It is an oppor-
tunity lost, but I have been reassured 
that enough Senators care about the 
issue, and perhaps they care about the 
issue because of the arguments that I 
have made. 
I will review these arguments first 
for the Nation and then for the area of 
the Nation most affected by coastal 
erosion, which is Louisiana, and then 
speak about possible solutions. 
First, over 272 million Americans live 
in coastal States, and 134 million 
Americans live in a parish or county 
directly on the coast, and they know 
sea levels are rising. Because sea levels 
are rising, they are increasingly ex-
posed to flooding. Now, if Congress 
does not act on coastal resiliency, 
these Americans, their lives, their 
communities, and livelihood will be in-
creasingly in danger. 
By the way, the American taxpayer 
will spend billions in disaster recovery 
because the Federal Government de-
clined to invest in prevention on the 
front end. Just to make this point, I 
will show my first poster. 
These are major coastal flood events 
since 2003, and these are only the 
named storms. It does not include the 
flood events that were not named, and 
some everybody remembers. Ivan was 
$20.5 billion. Katrina was $125 billion. 
Ike was $30 billion. Sandy was $65 bil-
lion. Isaac was $10 billion. Harvey was 
$125 billion. Irma was $50 billion. And 
Maria was $90 billion. If you are in one 
of the States affected by one of these 
storms, to say that name brings to 
mind friends that were lost, commu-
nities that were devastated, and lives 
that were overturned. This is merely 
the accounting, which totals, since 
2003, that the Federal Government has 
spent $617.9 billion in recovery after 
these storms, and that does not include 
unnamed flood events. 
Just as examples, people along the 
coast, wherever you are on the coast in 
the United States, including the Great 
Lakes, are at increased risk for large 
scale devastation, in part, because of 
sea levels rising, and natural barriers 
to absorb storm surge are eroding 
away. 
Let’s just go around the Nation. Let’s 
first look at the Alaskan village of 
Kivalina, located on an island that is 
literally vanishing because of sea level 
rise. There you see kind of a rock jetty 
around it, but the rock jetty is kind of 
missing over here. But you can imag-
ine, as sea levels rise, and waves, which 
in this picture are not there but you 
know in that area of the world are high 
at times, this will fulfill the Army 
Corps of Engineers’ prediction that in 
10 years, this island will be uninhabit-
able. 
Alaska’s Senator, LISA MURKOWSKI, 
recognizes the threat to her State 
should barrier islands disappear. I 
thank her for her support during the 
debate on the Great American Out-
doors Act for increased funds for coast-
al resiliency. 
That is our northern part. Let’s go to 
the Virgin Islands. 
Erosion has eliminated many trees 
and water vegetation that are vital to 
absorbing storm surge. These problems 
were compounded by Hurricane Irma, 
meaning that the next major hurricane 
could be worse. Could it be worse than 
that? Look at the American Virgin Is-
lands after Hurricane Irma. If it is 
worse than that, then this may be as 
the island is in Alaska—threatening to 
be uninhabitable. 
Rising sea levels are threatening 
beaches up and down the coast of Cali-
fornia, eliminating barrier islands in 
North Carolina and Georgia, and caus-
ing property values to fall and insur-
ance rates to rise where cases are at 
their worst. 
But let me speak of the worst-case 
scenario of sea level rising and land re-
ceding. Unfortunately, from my per-
spective, the worst area is in Lou-
isiana. By the time I am through with 
this speech, Louisiana will have lost 
about half a football field of land from 
the coast; it is washing away that fast. 
To date, we have lost land equal to the 
size of Delaware. At the current rate, 
Louisiana will lose about 640,000 more 
acres by 2050. That is like cutting 
Rhode Island out of the eastern coast. 
I mention Rhode Island and will take 
that opportunity to thank SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE from Rhode Island for rec-
ognizing the challenges coasts face and 
working with me to provide more sup-
port for more resiliency. He actually 
came down and looked at our plan. 
Wherever you see red, in a very rea-
sonable scenario, that land will be gone 
by year 50. And you can see that New 
Orleans effectively becomes an island. 
Can you imagine what the Federal 
Government would have to pay if a big 
storm came through without any wet-
lands to decrease the intensity? That 
would damage not just New Orleans 
but all the ports that inland United 
States depend on to get their goods to 
the rest of the world. I will have more 
on the importance of that port system 
later. 
As the marshes sink into the gulf, 
Louisiana is losing more than our 
treasured wetlands and the wildlife 
that call them home; we are losing nat-
ural barriers that save populated areas 
from the full brunt of hurricane forces. 
According to NOAA, peak floods can 
be reduced by up to 60 percent in wa-
tersheds that contain 15 percent wet-
lands. These wetlands act as natural 
sponges for floodwaters and buffer 
storm surges. The wetland vegetation 
holds sediment in place with their 
roots, and this preserves the land and 
further helps to absorb waves. 
What I just described is a dire fore-
cast, but it is also a reality that is 
playing out. We had a storm a week 
ago. Tropical Storm Cristobal struck 
Louisiana. Here we see images of a 
damaged levee system in Grand Isle, 
where storm surge completely washed 
away 2,000 feet of protection. 
Yes, those are buildings. Yes, that is 
a street. Yes, that is water in the mid-
dle of the street between the buildings. 
I will add that Grand Isle has lost 
about 9 feet of elevation over the past 
decades. 
When this washed away, it exposed 
what is called a burrito levee under-
neath, and that was damaged as well. 
Mayor David Camardelle recently 
told the Times-Picayune—the news-
paper in New Orleans—that the damage 
Grand Isle suffers ‘‘is a crisis situation. 
I’m worried this island will be cut in 
half.’’ 
Cristobal 
also 
flooded 
the 
old 
Mandeville 
neighborhood. 
This 
is 
Mandeville, and this is Cristobal. This 
shows how Lake Pontchartrain, which 
is the lake north of New Orleans, and 
the streets ashore basically merged for 
this storm event. 
This is just from a tropical storm. 
Imagine if a bigger hurricane had land-
ed instead—except we don’t have to 
imagine. We can look at what hap-
pened. And unfortunately it will hap-
pen again. 
What is at stake in Louisiana with-
out more investment in resiliency? 
Let’s 
start 
with 
lives. 
Hurricane 
Katrina killed 1,833 people and dam-
aged or destroyed 800,000 homes. That 
was in Louisiana, in Mississippi, in 
Alabama, and in Florida. That is just 
one storm. We have actually seen loss 
of life worse since then in Puerto Rico, 
where Hurricane Maria claimed 3,057 
lives. As I mentioned earlier, the dollar 
amount was greater in Sandy, which 
hit New York and New Jersey, and the 
most recent flooding events—Hurricane 
Harvey, for example, in the Houston 
area flooded so many homes. It is not 
just my home State; it is across the 
Nation. 
By the way, impacting my home 
State impacts the rest of the Nation. 
This is a picture from Hurricane 
Katrina. This Congress was very help-
ful in the aftermath. But let me speak 
about what will happen if we don’t ad-
dress these issues. 
The Nation’s energy infrastructure is 
threatened. The Gulf of Mexico gen-
erates about 90 percent of the funds 
used to pay for the Great American 
Outdoors Act. Oil and gas development, 
particularly in the Outer Continental 
Shelf, is that which funds this bill. 
Failing to secure the energy infrastruc-
ture can result in devastating damage

S3009 
June 16, 2020 
to the heart of America’s energy pro-
duction center should a major storm 
destroy the roads, ports, wells, and 
pipelines that keep America running. 
There is a certain irony that this 
bill, which chose not to fund coastal re-
siliency, relies upon funding from an 
infrastructure that is endangered by 
the lack of coastal resiliency. But this, 
in turn, threatens America’s heartland. 
Trade from America’s heartland to 
the rest of the world flows. Agricul-
tural products are shipped down the 
Mississippi River to the Louisiana 
ports and then internationally—that 
is, so long as the ports keep func-
tioning. 
Again, let’s look at the results of the 
damage to those ports—just the Port of 
New Orleans—after Hurricane Katrina. 
Damage to the Port of New Orleans 
after Hurricane Katrina resulted in 
corn exports falling 23 percent from the 
heartland—not 
from 
Louisiana 
but 
from Iowa, from the heartland, from 
Missouri, et cetera. Barley exports fell 
100 percent. Wheat exports fell 54 per-
cent. Soybean exports were down 25 
percent. Total grain exports were down 
24 percent. 
It is clear that the United States 
benefits as a whole when Louisiana’s 
coastline is fully functional and secure, 
both its energy supply—its funding for 
the Great American Outdoors Act—as 
well as the ability of farmers in the 
heartland to ship their goods inter-
nationally. But now the coastline is 
not secure. Aggressive action is needed 
to save the coastline—not just in my 
State but all around—to protect it 
from erosion and to protect it from 
flooding. 
In Louisiana, the money generated 
from revenue sharing of offshore en-
ergy production by an amendment in 
the Louisiana State Constitution is in-
vested into coastal resiliency. I am try-
ing to make sure that we have the re-
sources to continue to do so. 
That brings us to revenue sharing. As 
I have said before, oil and gas develop-
ment in the Gulf of Mexico generates 90 
percent of the funding for the Great 
American Outdoors Act, and the gulf 
coast contributes billions of revenue to 
the Treasury annually, but the amount 
of money that is shared with our coast-
line is quite small relative to what in-
land States receive. 
I bring this up because someone said: 
Well, Louisiana does get money from 
the coast. 
Let me just kind of explain this slide. 
In this slide, this is the total amount 
of revenue for the Federal for fiscal 
year 2018 from oil and gas development 
in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see 
there is close to $5 billion generated. 
These 
States 
here—Alabama, 
Lou-
isiana, Mississippi, and Texas—share 
$375 million of that money. 
Let’s look at the inland States. Here 
is all of the revenue from the inland 
States. The best I can tell, in that 
same year, New Mexico got about $1.25 
billion. Wyoming got $1.15 billion. Col-
orado did pretty well; it looks like they 
got about $400 million or $500 million. 
So the Gulf Coast States split between 
them $375 million from a total of about 
$4.8 billion. New Mexico gets 50 percent 
of the money generated in their inland 
areas, and so they get close to $1.25 bil-
lion. Louisiana could do so much with 
$1.25 billion to protect and to rebuild 
its wetlands, the infrastructure for en-
ergy, the infrastructure for ports, and I 
could go on. 
So folks are right. We do currently 
participate in revenue sharing. It is a 
shadow of what other States get with 
far less of a total amount. 
By the way, our amendment, which I 
have written with Senator WHITE-
HOUSE, is based upon what is called 
GOMESA, the Gulf of Mexico Energy 
Security Act. In that, Gulf States keep 
37.5 percent of the revenues, up until a 
cap of $375 million. I have mentioned 
that cap already. Additionally, there is 
$125 million put into the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, that which 
is now going to receive an additional 
$900 million annually from the Great 
American Outdoors Act. My coastal 
amendment would remove that cap, 
meaning that Gulf States would have a 
more equitable share of the revenue we 
produce. 
The LWCF would continue to get the 
$125 million it would receive, but there 
would be another amount of money 
that would go into the LWCF portion 
of this that would, under our amend-
ment, go into a coastal resiliency fund. 
That coastal resiliency fund would be 
used all around the Nation. It could be 
used in Florida, in Georgia, in Maine, 
in Alaska, in Washington State, in Ha-
waii—you name it. Where we have 
beach 
communities 
threatened 
and 
coastal parishes and counties regularly 
flooding, this money would be avail-
able. 
What I am asking for is fair treat-
ment for the States that put in the 
work and contribute so mightily to the 
rest of the country. Hopefully with 
this, we can turn the tide of land loss. 
By the way, the amendment we have 
is also combined with revenue sharing 
for offshore wind. This is SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE’s idea. So in the imme-
diate and intermediate, there would be 
revenue sharing from oil and gas devel-
opment, and in the long term, there 
would be revenue sharing from offshore 
wind as our Nation transitions to more 
of that as an energy source. 
I have talked a lot about gloom and 
doom in this speech. Let’s end on a 
hopeful note. Not all is lost. With 
smart strategies in funding, we can 
turn the tide on erosion, rebuild land, 
and strengthen the coastline. 
There are examples of what is work-
ing. Terrebonne Parish is in South 
Louisiana. It is right on the Gulf of 
Mexico. It has a new flood wall, which 
recently saved 10,000 households from 
flooding. We invested in flood protec-
tion, and we saved 10,000 families from 
flooding. We saved money for the Na-
tional Flood Insurance Program. A 
community is intact. Kids still go off 
on Saturday and play ball, and people 
still go to their jobs on Monday. In-
vesting on the front end saved a heck 
of a lot on the back end—lives, commu-
nities, and money for the Federal tax-
payer. 
Let’s look at a coastal rebuilding 
project we have. Davis Pond is an area 
along the Mississippi that has eroded. 
This is Google pictures. Here, you can 
see that in February of 1998, erosion 
had occurred such that all of this, 
which is along the coast, had eroded. 
You can see kind of a big lake right 
there, and you can see kind of a break-
up of the land. You have a sense of an 
unhealthy nature. Even though this is 
a black-and-white photo, nonetheless 
you have that sense. 
A diversion was built so that Mis-
sissippi River water could flood this 
area. In the 20 years since, you can see 
that the lake has filled in, that it is 
still wetland, it is still marsh, but here 
you have vegetation growing. Back 
here, if you stepped out of the boat, 
you sank into water. Now, you step out 
of the boat, and the vegetation is so 
thick that it supports you as you walk 
along. This is what can happen with 
wise management. 
Look at this community. This com-
munity is now protected because we 
now have a barrier of wetlands. So re-
building wetlands saves communities. 
It allows nature to do its work. It saves 
the taxpayer dollars in the long run. 
I am going to show another exam-
ple—Mardi Gras Pass, a naturally 
forming distributary of the Mississippi 
River that is building new land. Mardi 
Gras Pass has grown by 13 acres since 
2012. 
Let’s see if I have my pictures 
straight here. Here is the Mississippi 
River, and here is where the river kind 
of spontaneously broke through right 
in this area right here. 
Since then, as it continues to flow 
through, we have something which 
doesn’t look very healthy here, which 
increasingly has vegetation. Here is a 
bayou, which increasingly is building 
up vegetation. I am not sure these pic-
ture do it justice, but now you actually 
have trees growing, and you have such 
a density of land being built that you 
now again have oak trees, which Lou-
isiana is famous for. 
We can rebuild our coastline. The 
Mardi Gras Pass delivers fresh water, 
nutrients, and sediments to 15,000 acres 
of coastal marsh. 
These projects take time, but they 
never get started without the type of 
funding I advocated to be included in 
the Great American Outdoors Act—the 
amount we could spend on the front 
end and save lives and dollars for the 
Federal taxpayer compared to the ex-
penses required for storm recovery. 
Let me conclude. I end the day by 
once again commending my colleagues, 
Senator GARDNER and DAINES, for get-
ting their bill passed, but I also end by 
saying that we must continue to fight 
for dollars for coastal resiliency. The

need is far too great around the coun-
try. Lives and our economy depend on 
finding that solution. 
I hope the Senators who said they 
recognize coastal needs will join the bi-
partisan coalition of Senators who now 
are asking that we invest in the coast-
al parishes and counties where 82 per-
cent of Americans live in the States 
and 42 percent of Americans live in a

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, sec-

Act requires that Congress receive 
prior notification of certain proposed 
arms sales as defined by that statute. 
Upon such notification, the Congress 
has 30 calendar days during which the 
sale may be reviewed. The provision 
stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent 
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

Government and contractor engineering, 
technical, and logistics support services; and 
other related elements of logistical and pro-
gram support. The total estimated program 
cost is $862.3 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by helping to improve the 
military capability of Canada, a NATO ally 
that is an important force for ensuring polit-
ical stability and economic progress and a 
contributor to military, peacekeeping and 
humanitarian operations around the world. 
This sale will provide Canada a 2-squadron 
bridge of enhanced F/A–18A aircraft to con-
tinue meeting NORAD and NATO commit-
ments while it gradually introduces new ad-
vanced aircraft via the Future Fighter Capa-
bility Program between 2025 and 2035. 
The proposed sale of the capabilities, as 
listed, will improve Canada’s capability to 
meet current and future warfare threats and 
provide greater security for its critical infra-
structure. This sale will provide Canada the 
ability to maximize the systems’ employ-
ment and sustainment, significantly enhanc-
ing the warfighting capability of the Royal 
Canadian Air Force’s F/A–18 aircraft. Canada 
will have no difficulty absorbing this equip-
ment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractors will be Raytheon 
Corporation, El Segundo, CA; General Dy-
namics Mission Systems, Marion, VA; The 
Boeing Company, St. Louis, MO; and Collins 
Aerospace, Cedar Rapids, IA. The purchaser 
typically requests offsets. Any offset agree-
ment will be defined in negotiations between 
the purchaser and the contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of contractor rep-
resentatives to Canada on an intermittent 
basis over the life of the case to support de-
livery and integration of items onto the ex-
isting F/A–18A aircraft and to provide supply 
support management, inventory control and 
equipment familiarization. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

9M and replaces the AIM–9X Block I Missile 
configuration. The missile includes a high 
off-boresight 
seeker, 
enhanced 
counter-
measure rejection capability, low drag/high 
angle of attack airframe and the ability to 
integrate the Helmet Mounted Cueing Sys-
tem. The software algorithms are the most 
sensitive portion of the AIM–9X missile. The 
software continues to be modified via a 
preplanned product improvement (P3I) pro-
gram in order to improve its counter-coun-
termeasure capabilities. No software source 
code or algorithms will be released. The mis-
sile is classified as CONFIDENTIAL. The 
AIM–9X will result in the transfer of sen-
sitive 
technology 
and 
information. 
The 
equipment, hardware, and documentation 
are classified CONFIDENTIAL. The software 
and operational performance are classified 
SECRET. The seeker/guidance control sec-
tion and the target detector are CONFIDEN-
TIAL and contain sensitive state-of-the-art 
technology. Manuals and technical docu-
mentation that are necessary or support 
operational use and organizational manage-
ment are classified up to SECRET. Perform-
ance and operating logic of the counter- 
countermeasures circuits are classified SE-
CRET. The hardware, software, and data 
identified 
are 
classified 
to 
protect 
vulnerabilities, design and performance pa-
rameters and similar critical information. 
b. The AN/APG–79 Active Electronically 
Scanned Array (AESA) Radar System is clas-
sified SECRET. The radar provides the F/A– 
18A Hornet aircraft with all-weather, multi-
mission capability for performing Air-to-Air 
and Air-to-Ground targeting and attack. Air- 
to-Air modes provide the capability for all- 
aspect target detection, long-range search 
and track, automatic target acquisition, and 
tracking of multiple targets. Air-to-Surface 
attack modes provide high-resolution ground 
mapping navigation, weapon delivery, and 
sensor cueing. The system component hard-
ware (Antenna, Transmitter, Radar Data 
Processor, and Power Supply) is UNCLASSI-
FIED. The Receiver-Exciter hardware is 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
The 
radar 
Operational 
Flight Program (OFP) is classified SECRET. 
Documentation provided with the AN/APG– 
79 radar set is classified SECRET. 
c. The AGM–154 Joint Standoff Weapon 
(JSOW) is used by Navy, Marine Corps, and 
Air Force, and allows aircraft to attack well- 
defended targets in day, night, and adverse 
weather conditions. AGM–154C carries a 
BROACH warhead. The BROACH warhead in-
corporates an advanced multi-stage warhead. 
JSOW–C uses the GPS Precise Positioning 
System (PPS), which provides for a more ac-
curate 
capability 
than 
the 
commercial 
version of GPS. The JSOW–C incorporates 
components, software, and technical design 
information that are considered sensitive. 
The following JSOW–C components being 
conveyed by the proposed sale that are con-
sidered sensitive and are classified CON-
FIDENTIAL include the GPS/INS, IIR seek-
er, OFP software and missile operational 
characteristics and performance data. These 
elements are essential to the ability of the 
JSOW–C missile to selectively engage hostile 
targets under a wide range of operational, 
tactical, and environmental conditions. 
d. The Wide Band RADOME (WBR) is a 
high performance nose radome designed for 
use with the Active Electronically Scanned 
Array (AESA) Radar. The WBR is required to 
leverage the full capability of the AESA 
Radar. The Radome will provide superior RF 
performance over broader AESA Radar oper-
ational bands which will give the user an ad-
vantage in operational scenarios. Specifi-
cally, the WBR will provide improved target 
detection with less interference and reduce 
jamming 
vulnerability. 
Purchasing 
the 
AESA without the WBR would significantly 
reduce the capability of the AESA and the 
user would gain very little advantage with 
the AESA. 
e. The Upgrades to the Advanced Distrib-
uted Combat Training System (ADCTS), pro-
vides an aggressive program upgrade the 
warfighting capability of the F/A–18. The 
program will introduce new systems and 
weapons to the aircraft. In order to have pi-
lots ready to utilize the new technologies, it 
is imperative that the user’s Pilot Trainer 
(ADCTS) undergoes a parallel upgrade effort. 
The ADCTS is an integral part of the user’s 
Pilot Training Syllabus and this procure-
ment will address this requirement. It will 
provide pilots the ability to train with the 
new systems that will be resident in the air-
craft in a simulated environment. This pro-
curement will provide pilots the ability to 
maximize use of the new capabilities that 
will eventually translate to the operational 
environment and make the users Air Force a 
significant contributor to international coa-
lition initiatives. 
f. Software Development. The challenge 
facing the user nation is that in order to add 
all the new capabilities and weapons to the 
platform there is a parallel software effort 
required to ensure all the new capabilities 
have a software model that will support 
their integration and use. The success of the 
aggressive procurement of the systems and 
capabilities for the program will be depend-
ent on the ability to develop and test the 
requisite software. This is a significant ef-
fort that will rely on Naval Air Weapons Sta-
tion China Lake to develop the required 
products. This will entail development of the 
product, lab testing and eventually flight 
testing of the software loads. There will be 
some mutual software development, but the 
end result will depend on U.S. Government 
engineers to provide final check and ap-
proval of all software profiles. This FMS 
case funds this effort. Additionally, the soft-
ware effort will support Automatic Ground 
Collision Avoidance System (A–GCAS). This 
system is also referred to as Automatic Ter-
rain Avoidance Warning System (A–TAWS). 
This is flight control software that uses a 
terrain elevation database to calculate the 
aircraft’s relative position above the ground. 
If it senses that the aircraft is on a collision 
course with the ground that is outside of 
normal parameters, it automatically com-
mands the aircraft to roll wings level and re-
cover away from a ground collision 
g. The ADM–141C Improved Tactical Air- 
Launched Decoy (ITALD) is unclassified. The 
ITALD vehicle is intended to be delivered by 
sea- and land-based tactical aircraft, to 
cause an increase in the number of apparent 
targets to enemy defenses prior to or during 
air strikes. The ITALD system consists of 
the flight vehicle, launch rack (Improved 
Triple 
Ejector 
Rack 
(ITER)), 
Improved 
Decoy Tester/Programmer (IDTP), Radio 
Frequency Payload System Tester (PSST), 
and shipping/storage container. The ITALD 
is capable of functioning in the vehicle test 
mode, mission programming mode (using 
JMPS with ITALD UPC), GPS almanac 
uploading mode, captive carriage mode, 
launch mode, jettison mode, and free-flight 
mode. 
h. The Joint Mission Planning System 
(JMPS) is classified SECRET. JMPS will 
provide mission planning capability for sup-
port of military aviation operations. It will 
also provide support for unit-level mission 
planning for all phases of military flight op-
erations and have the capability to provide 
necessary mission data for the aircrew. 
JMPS will support the downloading of data 
to electronics data transfer devices for trans-
fer to aircraft and weapon systems. A JMPS 
for a specific aircraft type will consist of 
basic planning tools called the Joint Mission 
Planning Environment (JMPE) mated with a 
Unique Planning Component (UPC) provided 
by the aircraft program. In addition, UPCs 
will be required for specific weapons, com-
munication devices, and moving map dis-
plays. The JMPS will be tailored to the spe-
cific releasable configuration for the F/A– 
18A, with maximum commonality with the 
most advanced United States Marine Corps 
configuration of these aircraft. 
i. The AN/ARC–210 RT–2036 (Gen 6) Radio’s 
Line-of-sight data transfer rates up to 80 
kb/s in a 25 kHz channel creating high-speed 
communication of critical situational aware-
ness information for increased mission effec-
tiveness. Software that is reprogrammable in 
the field via Memory Loader/Verifier Soft-
ware making flexible use for multiple mis-
sions. The AN/ARC–210 has embedded soft-
ware with programmable cryptography for 
secure communications. Relative to the 5th 
Generation AN/ARC–210 radios, the 6th gen-
eration AN/ARC–210 RT–2036 adds, in addi-
tion to newer hardware, the Mobile User Ob-
jective System (MUOS) capability. Access to 
the MUOS satellite constellation can be ef-
fectively controlled by withholding the rel-
evant order wire keys from RT–2036 users. 
2. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware or software in this proposed sale, 
the information could be used to develop 
countermeasures which might reduce weapon 
system effectiveness or be used in the devel-
opment of a system with similar or advance 
capabilities. 
3. A determination has been made that the 
recipient country, the Government of Can-
ada can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the classified and sen-
sitive technology being released as the 
United States Government. This sale is nec-
essary in furtherance if the United States 
Foreign Policy and National Security objec-
tives outlined in the Policy Justification. 
4. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Can-
ada.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING BEST MEMORIES 
ACADEMY 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize a small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit at the heart of our 
country. It is my privilege to recognize 
a woman-owned small business that 
provides an enriching environment for 
children and serves a diverse commu-
nity. This week, it is my pleasure to 
honor Best Memories Academy of Or-
lando, FL, as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week. 
For 20 years, Best Memories Acad-
emy has provided quality childcare for 
families in Orlando, FL. When her son 
was 2 years old, Lyana Vazquez, origi-
nally from Puerto Rico, began search-
ing for a daycare program that would 
provide instruction in English and 
Spanish, but options were limited in 
the Orlando area. Undeterred, Lyana 
founded Best Memories Academy, to 
provide daycare and preschool pro-
grams with an emphasis on bilingual 
education.

June 16, 2020 
Over the years, Best Memories Acad-
emy has expanded its services. Lyana 
developed a bilingual curriculum and 
built 
strong 
relationships 
with 
Orlando’s growing Latino community. 
She hired educators who spoke English 
and Spanish, incorporating the LENA 
Grow Program into their training. This 
research-based program enabled staff 
to 
begin 
conversational 
language 
teaching during critical stages of lan-
guage learning. In 2019, Best Memories 
Academy began offering kindergarten 
and first grade instruction in addition 
to 
voluntary 
prekindergarten 
and 
after-school care. They partnered with 
the Early Learning Coalition of Orange 
County, ELCOC, to host educational 
workshops and community outreach 
events, becoming one of the premier 
daycare centers in the area. 
Like many other small businesses, 
Best Memories Academy experienced a 
sharp decline in revenue due to the 
coronavirus pandemic. As student en-
rollment dropped, Lyana modified her 
business operations to comply with the 
latest best practices from the Center 
for Disease Control, Florida Depart-
ment of Health, and Florida Depart-
ment of Children and Families. To-
gether, she and her team assembled 
and dropped remote-learning packets 
for students, taking special care with 
the materials for children whose fami-
lies lacked internet access. Despite the 
challenges, Lyana was determined to 
stay open to care for the children of es-
sential workers and keep her employ-
ees paid. 
When the U.S. Small Business Ad-
ministration launched the Paycheck 
Protection Program PPP, Lyana im-
mediately applied. The PPP provides 
forgivable loans to impacted small 
businesses and nonprofits who main-
tain their payroll during the COVID–19 
pandemic. Nine days after she sub-
mitted an application, Best Memories 
Academy received funding for a PPP 
loan in early April. As a result, Lyana 
was able to keep her 12 employees paid 
and keep her business open until Flor-
ida began to reopen and students re-
turned. For Lyana and her team, the 
Paycheck Protection Program didn’t 
just provide a salary—it provided hope. 
Best Memories Academy is a notable 
example of the role of relationship- 
driven small businesses in building 
community. I commend their work to 
provide 
high-quality 
bilingual 
edu-
cation to children ranging from in-
fancy to elementary school. Congratu-
lations to Lyana and the entire team 
at Best Memories Academy. I look for-
ward 
to 
watching 
your 
continued 
growth and success in the Orlando 
area.∑

mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 623 
Whereas Otto Frederick Warmbier was 
born on December 12, 1994, in Cincinnati, 
Ohio, to parents Fred and Cindy Warmbier; 
Whereas, upon his graduation as Salutato-
rian from Wyoming High School in 2013, Otto 
attended the University of Virginia; 
Whereas, on December 29, 2015, Otto flew to 
North Korea as part of a guided tour; 
Whereas, on January 2, 2016, the Govern-
ment of the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea arrested Otto Warmbier on false 
charges of ‘‘subversion’’ and committing a 
‘‘hostile act’’; 
Whereas, on March 16, 2016, Otto Warmbier 
was convicted and sentenced to 15 years of 
hard labor; 
Whereas, as a result of his mistreatment at 
the hands of North Korean authorities, Otto 
Warmbier suffered a serious medical emer-
gency which placed him into a comatose 
state, and the North Korean authorities 
failed to report the deterioration of Otto 
Warmbier’s physical condition to United 
States authorities; 
Whereas, on June 13, 2017, after 17 months 
in captivity, the United States Department 
of State announced that it had secured the 
release of Otto Warmbier, whereupon he was 
medically evacuated from North Korea in a 
comatose state to the University of Cin-
cinnati Medical Center; 
Whereas, on June 19, 2017, Otto Warmbier 
died in the hospital as a result of his mis-
treatment at the hands of the Government of 
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea; 
Whereas, on December 24, 2018, the United 
States District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia concluded that the Government of 
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea 
was responsible for the ‘‘torture, hostage 
taking, and extrajudicial killing’’ of Otto 
Warmbier; 
Whereas, on December 18, 2019, in an an-
nual resolution, the United Nations General 
Assembly condemned ‘‘the long-standing and 
ongoing systematic, widespread and gross 
violations of human rights in and by’’ North

Whereas, on December 20, 2019, the Otto 
Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions 
and Enforcement Act of 2019 (title LXXI of 
Public Law 116–92), was enacted: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That, in recognition of the 3rd 
anniversary of Otto Warmbier’s passing on 
June 19, 2020, the Senate— 
(1) remembers and celebrates the life of 
Otto Frederick Warmbier, a young man with 
great potential; 
(2) condemns the Government of the Demo-
cratic People’s Republic of Korea, which is 
responsible for the unjustified arrest, mis-
treatment, and death of Otto Warmbier; 
(3) calls for the United States Government 
to continue to use its voice and vote in the 
United 
Nations 
to 
condemn 
systematic 
human rights violations in North Korea; and 
(4) calls for the sanctions enacted in the 
Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanc-
tions and Enforcement Act of 2019 (title 
LXXI of Public Law 116–92) to remain fully 
implemented until such time that the Gov-
ernment of the Democratic People’s Repub-
lic of Korea commits to the verifiable sus-
pension of its proliferation and testing of 
weapons of mass destruction, and has agreed 
to multilateral talks, including the United 
States Government, with the goal of perma-
nently and verifiably limiting North Korea’s 
weapons of mass destruction and ballistic 
missile programs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3014 
June 16, 2020 
Whereas the Wagner Group was involved in 
the Russian Federation’s military takeover 
and illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea 
region in February and March 2014, and in 
the subsequent insurgencies in the eastern 
Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk; 
Whereas the Wagner Group has been pro-
viding military support to the regime of 
Bashar al-Assad in Syria since 2015, fighting 
alongside its forces and helping it recapture 
significant parts of the country; 
Whereas, on February 7, 2018, the Wagner 
Group led an armed assault on United States 
troops near the city of Deir al-Zour in east-
ern Syria, prompting a United States coun-
terattack, in what the Washington Post has 
described as ‘‘the deadliest United States- 
Russia clash since the Cold War’’; 
Whereas the Wagner Group has supported 
Khalifa Haftar and his ‘‘Libyan National 
Army’’ by providing mercenaries, artillery, 
tanks, drones, and ammunition in violation 
of a United Nations arms embargo, with 
Yevgeniy Prigozhin personally attending a 
meeting between Haftar and Russian Defense 
Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow on No-
vember 7, 2018; 
Whereas a United Nations report made 
public on May 6, 2020, concluded that the 
Wagner Group has operated up to 1,200 mili-
tary contractors in Libya, including snipers 
and specialized military teams, serving ‘‘as 
an effective force multiplier’’ for Haftar’s 
army; 
Whereas Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his affili-
ated entities have been tied to influence op-
erations on behalf of the Government of the 
Russian Federation in Africa, with entities 
associated with Prigozhin reportedly oper-
ating in at least 20 countries, including the 
Central African Republic, Madagascar, Mo-
zambique, and Sudan; 
Whereas about 235 Russian military and 
private security personnel have deployed to 
the Central African Republic since 2017, some 
of whom are reportedly employed by the 
Wagner Group, and some of whom provide 
personal security for President Faustin- 
Archange Touade´ra; 
Whereas Russian national Valery Zak-
harov, who is reportedly a former intel-
ligence official, has served as a top national 
security advisor to Central African Republic 
President Faustin-Archange Touade´ra since 
at least 2018; 
Whereas, in July 2018, Russian journalists 
Orkhan Dzhemal, Kirill Radchenko, and 
Alexander Rastorguyev were murdered in the 
Central African Republic while working on a 
documentary about the activities of the 
Wagner Group in that country; 
Whereas neither the Government of the 
Central African Republic nor the Govern-
ment of the Russian Federation are con-
ducting credible and thorough investigations 
into the murder of these 3 journalists; 
Whereas, according to an investigation by 
the London-based Dossier Center, the jour-
nalists had been tracked by officers of the 
Central African Republic gendarmerie who 
were in close communication with Russian 
nationals with ties to Prigozhin, including 
Alexander Sotov, who in turn was reportedly 
in contact with Zakharov; 
Whereas companies owned by Yevgeniy 
Prigozhin reportedly had made regular pay-
ments to senior Central African Republic of-
ficials, including the Police Chief and the 
Minister of National Security; 
Whereas, on December 20, 2016, the Depart-
ment of the Treasury designated Yevgeniy 
Prigozhin 
under 
Executive 
Order 
13661, 
‘‘Blocking Property of Additional Persons 
Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine,’’ 
‘‘for having materially assisted, sponsored, 
or provided financial, material, or techno-
logical support for, or goods or services in 
support of, senior officials of the Russian 
Federation’’; 
Whereas, on June 20, 2017, the Department 
of the Treasury designated the Wagner 
Group under Executive Order 13660, ‘‘Block-
ing Property of Certain Persons Contrib-
uting to the Situation in Ukraine,’’ ‘‘for 
being responsible for or complicit in, or hav-
ing engaged in, directly or indirectly, ac-
tions or policies that threaten the peace, se-
curity, stability, sovereignty, or territorial 
integrity of Ukraine’’; 
Whereas, on March 15, 2018, the Depart-
ment of the Treasury designated Yevgeniy 
Prigozhin, his affiliated entities, including 
the Internet Research Agency, and his subor-
dinates under Executive Order 13694, ‘‘Block-
ing the Property of Certain Persons Engag-
ing in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled 
Activities,’’ for being ‘‘involved in inter-
fering with [United States] election proc-
esses or institutions’’; 
Whereas, on February 16, 2018, the Depart-
ment of Justice announced the indictment of 
Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his affiliated enti-
ties, including the Internet Research Agen-
cy, for engaging in ‘‘operations to interfere 
with the United States political system, in-
cluding the 2016 United States presidential 
election’’ and conducting ‘‘information war-
fare’’ against the United States; 
Whereas, on September 20, 2018, the De-
partment of State added Prigozhin, his affili-
ated entities, including the Internet Re-
search Agency, and the Wagner Group to the 
list of persons identified as part of, or oper-
ating for or on behalf of, the defense or intel-
ligence sectors of the Government of the 
Russian Federation under section 231 of the 
Countering America’s Adversaries Through 
Sanctions Act (22 U.S.C. 9525); 
Whereas, on September 30, 2019, under Ex-
ecutive Order 13848, the Department of the 
Treasury took additional steps to increase 
pressure on Prigozhin by designating phys-
ical assets—3 aircraft and a yacht—and 3 as-
sociated front companies of his; 
Whereas, on February 15, 2019, Gavin 
Williamson, then-United Kingdom Defense 
Secretary, said that the ‘‘clandestine use of 
proxies, mercenary armies like the infamous 
and unaccountable Wagner Group, allows the 
Kremlin to get away with murder while de-
nying the blood on their hands’’; 
Whereas, on December 13, 2018, John 
Bolton, then-Assistant to the President for 
National Security Affairs, affirmed that ‘‘the 
predatory practices pursued by China and 
Russia. . . in Africa. . . pose a significant 
threat to United States national security in-
terests’’; and 
Whereas General Stephen J. Townsend, 
Commander of the United States Africa 
Command, on April 2, 2019, expressed great 
‘‘concern’’ about the Wagner group, and, on 
January 30, 2020, noted that private military 
contractors such as Wagner, are ‘‘leading the 
fight in Libya against the UN-backed and 
U.S.-recognized Government of National Ac-
cord’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the activities of Russian national 
Yevgeniy Prigozhin, his affiliated entities, 
and the Wagner Group pose a threat to the 
national interests and national security of 
the United States; and 
(2) the President, in addition to maintain-
ing sanctions on Yevgeniy Prigozhin, his af-
filiated entities, and the Wagner Group, 
should work with Congress to develop and 
execute a strategy drawing on the multiple 
instruments of United States national power 
available to the President, to counter the 
malign influence and activities of Prigozhin, 
the entities linked to him, and the Wagner 
Group.

THE VACCINE ALLIANCE 
Mr. GARDNER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of Calendar No. 469, S. 
Res. 511. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 511) supporting the 
role of the United States in helping save the 
lives of children and protecting the health of 
people in developing countries with vaccines 
and immunization through GAVI, the Vac-
cine Alliance. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic, and with an amend-
ment to strike the preamble and insert 
the part printed in italic, as follows: 
Whereas access to vaccines and routine immu-
nizations can protect children from deadly but 
preventable diseases, reduce poverty, and con-
tribute to economic growth by enabling people to 
live longer, healthier, and more productive lives; 
Whereas investments in the development and 
deployment of vaccines and immunizations can 
also help enhance global health security by re-
ducing the incidence of deadly and debilitating 
diseases and containing the spread of infectious 
diseases before they become pandemic health 
threats; 
Whereas, prior to 2000, resources for and ac-
cess to vaccines for children in the developing 
world were declining, immunization rates were 
stagnant or decreasing, and nearly 10,000,000 
children were dying each year before reaching 
their 5th birthday; 
Whereas, prior to 2000, it was common for new 
life-saving vaccines to take up to 15 years to be 
introduced in the world’s least developed coun-
tries; 
Whereas, in 2000, the United States Govern-
ment joined forces with the Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation, the United Nations Chil-
dren’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Orga-
nization, the World Bank, other donor govern-
ments, and representatives of developing coun-
tries, faith-based organizations, civil society, 
and the private sector, including the vaccine in-
dustry, to create the Global Alliance for Vac-
cines and Immunization (now known as GAVI 
or GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance), a public-private 
partnership to expand access to new and 
underused vaccines, reduce the incidence of 
deadly 
and 
debilitating 
diseases, 
prevent 
epidemics, and save lives; 
Whereas GAVI has since supported country- 
led vaccine initiatives in 73 countries, enabled 
immunizations for more than 760,000,000 of the 
world’s most vulnerable children, helped avert 
an estimated 13,000,000 deaths, and contributed 
to a 70-percent reduction in the number of 
deaths due to vaccine-preventable diseases; 
Whereas country ownership and sustain-
ability are at the core of the GAVI model, which 
requires each eligible country to commit their 
own domestic resources to vaccination and im-
munization programs; 
Whereas 15 countries have transitioned from 
GAVI support and are now self-financing their 
own vaccination and immunization programs, 3 
more are expected to transition by the end of 
2020, and an additional 10 countries are ex-
pected to transition by 2025 (in total, 40 percent 
of the original set of GAVI-eligible countries); 
Whereas GAVI has transformed the market for 
vaccines by pooling demand from developing 
countries, securing predictable financing, ex-
panding the global supplier base, enhancing the 
competitiveness and security of supply chains, 
and creating efficiencies that are expected to 
generate an estimated $900,000,000 in savings be-
tween 2021 and 2025; 
Whereas, in addition to its current portfolio of 
vaccines, GAVI is working to support the roll- 
out and scale-up of newly approved vaccines for 
diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) boost-
ers, 
hepatitis 
B 
birth 
dose, 
multivalent 
meningococcal, respiratory syncytia (RSV), rou-
tine oral cholera, and rabies; 
Whereas GAVI also collaborates with the 
Global Polio Eradication Initiative to bring 
polio vaccines into routine immunization pro-
grams, strengthen health systems, and imple-
ment additional polio protections; 
Whereas GAVI has made significant progress 
in supporting the development and stockpiling 
of an effective vaccine to combat Ebola; 
Whereas GAVI is participating in efforts to 
test and implement an effective vaccine to pre-
vent malaria, a disease that kills more than 
270,000 children a year; 
Whereas GAVI is already helping countries 
maintain life-saving immunization programs in 
the midst of the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic to 
prevent multiple outbreaks and further loss of 
life from vaccine-preventable diseases; 
Whereas GAVI also is working to help coun-
tries meet the threat of COVID–19 by providing 
vital resources, training, and supplies to help 
protect health workers and expand access to di-
agnostic testing; 
Whereas GAVI will play a critical role in 
helping to rebuild immunization systems so that 
once the immediate crisis is over, catch-up im-
munization campaigns can begin and COVID–19 
vaccines can be introduced; 
Whereas, in April 2020, GAVI joined the Ac-
cess to COVID–19 Tools Accelerator, a collabo-
ration of global health organizations aimed at 
accelerating development, production, and equi-
table access to new COVID–19 technologies, 
serving as the co-lead of the vaccines work 
stream within the initiative; 
Whereas, on June 4, 2020, the United Kingdom 
will host an online virtual Global Vaccine Sum-
mit, GAVI’s third replenishment conference, 
with an ambitious goal to raise $7,400,000,000 in 
new donor commitments; 
Whereas, with these additional resources, 
GAVI plans to support the immunization of 
300,000,000 children against potentially fatal 
diseases and save an additional 7,000,000 to 
8,000,000 lives between 2021 and 2025; and 
Whereas the United States has been a leading 
supporter of GAVI since its inception, and its 
continued commitment will be essential to the 
achievement of the alliance’s goals for 2021 
through 2025: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commends the work of GAVI and its part-
ners for their efforts to expand access to vac-
cines and immunizations for the most vulnerable 
men, women, and children in developing coun-
tries; 
(2) affirms the continued support of the 
United States Government for GAVI as an effi-
cient and effective mechanism to advance global 
health security and save lives by— 
(A) reducing the incidence of deadly and de-
bilitating diseases; 
(B) leveraging donor, partner country, and 
private sector investments in health systems ca-
pable of sustainably delivering vaccines and im-
munizations; and 
(C) reducing the cost of vaccines while pro-
moting supply chain security and sustainability; 
(3) affirms the support of the United States 
Government for the goal of securing at least 
$7,400,000,000 in donor commitments for GAVI’s 
third replenishment conference, to be held on 
June 4, 2020, hosted by the United Kingdom; 
(4) urges donor countries and private sector 
partners to step up the fight against vaccine- 
preventable deaths and increase their pledges 
for the third replenishment conference; 
(5) urges GAVI partner countries to continue 
to make and meet ambitious co-financing com-
mitments to sustain progress in ending vaccine- 
preventable deaths; and 
(6) encourages the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID) and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 
cooperation with GAVI, to continue their work 
to strengthen public health capacity to intro-
duce and sustain the use of new and underused 
vaccines in routine immunization programs. 
Mr. GARDNER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the committee-reported sub-
stitute amendment to the resolution be

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment,

The bill clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 525) expressing the 
sense of the Senate that the United States 
should continue to support the people of 
Nicaragua in their peaceful efforts to pro-
mote the restoration of democracy and the 
defense of human rights, and use the tools

S. RES. 525 
Whereas the government of Daniel Ortega 
has concentrated power and brought about 
the progressive deterioration of democratic 
conditions in Nicaragua; 
Whereas recent elections in Nicaragua, in-
cluding the 2016 presidential election, have 
been marred by irregularities and character-
ized by significant restrictions on the par-
ticipation of opposition political parties and 
the absence of credible international and 
local electoral observers; 
Whereas Nicaraguan security forces, para-
military, police, and other actors working 
under the direction of the Ortega regime 
committed gross violations of human rights 
and acts of repression, resulting in more 
than 325 deaths, over 2,000 injuries, and at 
least 800 arbitrary detentions during the 
peaceful protests that took place in 2018, ac-
cording to the Organization of American 
States; 
Whereas a report by the Interdisciplinary 
Group of Independent Experts, appointed by 
the Organization of American States Inter- 
American Commission on Human Rights, de-
termined that the Ortega regime used delib-
erate, lethal force against protesters and 
committed acts of torture that meet the 
international 
legal 
standard 
of 
crimes 
against humanity;

ber 2019, according to the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees; 
Whereas the Government and people of 
Costa Rica have graciously accepted nearly 
70,000 Nicaraguans, including enrolling chil-
dren in public primary schools, allowing ac-
cess to legal employment, and making ef-
forts to strengthen the capacity of Costa 
Rica’s asylum system; 
Whereas the Ortega government failed to 
comply with its commitment to release all 
political prisoners, releasing just 392 people, 
of which 286 were released to house arrest 
with charges still pending; 
Whereas Nicaragua’s Civic Alliance for 
Justice and Democracy alleges that there re-
main over 150 political prisoners held in Nic-
araguan prisons as of November 29, 2019; 
Whereas a United States citizen and Navy 
veteran, 57-year-old Eddy Montes, was shot 
and killed while in the custody of the Nica-
raguan police at La Modelo Prison on May 
16, 2019; 
Whereas the Government of Nicaragua has 
failed in its national response to prevent the 
spread and transmission of COVID–19, includ-
ing through its refusal to implement COVID–19 
precautions or allow widespread testing for local 
transmission; 
Whereas, on May 8, 2020, according to Am-
nesty International, over a dozen people who re-
main in detention after being arrested for par-
ticipating in the 2018 protests have now dem-
onstrated symptoms consistent with COVID–19; 
Whereas the government of Daniel Ortega 
has severely restricted freedom of the press 
by closing five local television stations, at-
tacking independent radio stations, arbi-
trarily detaining journalists, and arbitrarily 
restricting print supplies from entering the 
country; 
Whereas, beginning on November 14, 2019, 
Nicaraguan police conducted attacks on 
churches throughout the country, cut water 
to hunger strikers barricaded inside a church 
in Masaya, and arrested 13 people attempting 
to bring them water; 
Whereas doctors, lawyers, academics, and 
other professionals in Nicaragua face perse-
cution and, in some cases torture, based on 
suspicion of aiding or sympathizing with 
protestors; 
Whereas the Ortega regime has violated 
the economic and political rights of indige-
nous communities, Afro-descendent popu-
lations, rural campesinos, land rights defend-
ers, and individuals living in the Caribbean 
Autonomous Regions of Nicaragua; 
Whereas, on November 27, 2018, Executive

the President to sanction non-United States 
persons 
implicated 
in 
egregious 
human 
rights abuses and corruption in Nicaragua; 
Whereas the NICA Act expresses the sup-
port of Congress for a negotiated solution to 
the Nicaraguan crisis and includes an annual 
certification to waive sanctions if the Ortega 
government takes steps to restore demo-
cratic governance and uphold human rights; 
Whereas, in the absence of such steps, the 
Department of State and the Department of 
the Treasury have imposed targeted sanc-

Mr. GARDNER. I ask unanimous con-
sent 
that 
the 
committee-reported 
amendments 
to 
the 
resolution 
be 
agreed to; that the resolution, as 
amended, be agreed to; that the pre-
amble, as amended, be agreed to; and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendments 
were agreed to. 
The resolution (S. Res. 525), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
The committee-reported amendment 
to the preamble was agreed to. 
The 
preamble, 
as 
amended, 
was 
agreed to. 
The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, as amended, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 525 
Whereas the government of Daniel Ortega 
has concentrated power and brought about 
the progressive deterioration of democratic 
conditions in Nicaragua; 
Whereas recent elections in Nicaragua, in-
cluding the 2016 presidential election, have 
been marred by irregularities and character-
ized by significant restrictions on the par-
ticipation of opposition political parties and 
the absence of credible international and 
local electoral observers; 
Whereas Nicaraguan security forces, para-
military, police, and other actors working 
under the direction of the Ortega regime 
committed gross violations of human rights 
and acts of repression, resulting in more 
than 325 deaths, over 2,000 injuries, and at 
least 800 arbitrary detentions during the 
peaceful protests that took place in 2018, ac-
cording to the Organization of American 
States; 
Whereas a report by the Interdisciplinary 
Group of Independent Experts, appointed by 
the Organization of American States Inter- 
American Commission on Human Rights, de-
termined that the Ortega regime used delib-
erate, lethal force against protesters and 
committed acts of torture that meet the 
international 
legal 
standard 
of 
crimes 
against humanity; 
Whereas an estimated 82,000 Nicaraguans 
fled the country between April 2018 and Octo-
ber 2019, according to the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees; 
Whereas the Government and people of 
Costa Rica have graciously accepted nearly 
70,000 Nicaraguans, including enrolling chil-
dren in public primary schools, allowing ac-
cess to legal employment, and making ef-
forts to strengthen the capacity of Costa 
Rica’s asylum system; 
Whereas the Ortega government failed to 
comply with its commitment to release all 
political prisoners, releasing just 392 people, 
of which 286 were released to house arrest 
with charges still pending; 
Whereas Nicaragua’s Civic Alliance for 
Justice and Democracy alleges that there re-
main over 150 political prisoners held in Nic-
araguan prisons as of November 29, 2019; 
Whereas a United States citizen and Navy 
veteran, 57-year-old Eddy Montes, was shot 
and killed while in the custody of the Nica-
raguan police at La Modelo Prison on May 
16, 2019; 
Whereas the Government of Nicaragua has 
failed in its national response to prevent the 
spread and transmission of COVID–19, includ-
ing through its refusal to implement COVID– 
19 precautions or allow widespread testing 
for local transmission; 
Whereas, on May 8, 2020, according to Am-
nesty International, over a dozen people who 
remain in detention after being arrested for 
participating in the 2018 protests have now 
demonstrated 
symptoms 
consistent 
with 
COVID–19; 
Whereas the government of Daniel Ortega 
has severely restricted freedom of the press 
by closing five local television stations, at-
tacking independent radio stations, arbi-
trarily detaining journalists, and arbitrarily 
restricting print supplies from entering the 
country; 
Whereas, beginning on November 14, 2019, 
Nicaraguan police conducted attacks on 
churches throughout the country, cut water 
to hunger strikers barricaded inside a church 
in Masaya, and arrested 13 people attempting 
to bring them water; 
Whereas doctors, lawyers, academics, and 
other professionals in Nicaragua face perse-
cution and, in some cases torture, based on 
suspicion of aiding or sympathizing with 
protestors;

Whereas the Ortega regime has violated 
the economic and political rights of indige-
nous communities, Afro-descendent popu-
lations, rural campesinos, land rights defend-
ers, and individuals living in the Caribbean 
Autonomous Regions of Nicaragua; 
Whereas, on November 27, 2018, Executive 
Order 13851 was issued, which blocks the 
property of certain persons involved in the 
Nicaraguan crisis, and its application was 
expanded by the Office of Foreign Asset Con-
trol of the Department of the Treasury on 
September 4, 2019; 
Whereas the bipartisan Nicaragua Human 
Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018 (Pub-
lic Law 115–335; commonly referred to as the 
‘‘NICA Act’’) was signed into law on Decem-
ber 20, 2018, imposing restrictions on lending 
to the Nicaraguan government by inter-
national financial institutions and requiring 
the President to sanction non-United States 
persons 
implicated 
in 
egregious 
human 
rights abuses and corruption in Nicaragua; 
Whereas the NICA Act expresses the sup-
port of Congress for a negotiated solution to 
the Nicaraguan crisis and includes an annual 
certification to waive sanctions if the Ortega 
government takes steps to restore demo-
cratic governance and uphold human rights; 
Whereas, in the absence of such steps, the 
Department of State and the Department of 
the Treasury have imposed targeted sanc-
tions on Nicaraguan officials and entities, 
including First Lady and Vice President 
Rosario Murillo, Daniel Ortega’s sons, Rafael 
Ortega Murillo and Laureano Ortega Murillo, 
and 
Nicaragua’s 
Banco 
Corporativo 
(Bancorp); 
Whereas, in June 2019, the Government of 
Canada imposed sanctions on 12 members of 
the Government of Nicaragua engaged in 
gross and systemic human rights violations; 
and 
Whereas, in advance of any future election, 
the Government of Nicaragua urgently needs 
to undertake electoral reforms, including 
the appointment of independent new mag-
istrates to the Supreme Electoral Council, 
the restoration of a 50 percent plus one 
threshold for the presidential election, the 
establishment of a second round of voting if 
the electoral threshold is not reached, the 
establishment of a detailed electoral cal-
endar, and stronger observation by political 
parties: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) calls on the Government of Nicaragua 
to immediately release all political prisoners 
without conditions and cease all acts of vio-
lence, repression, and intimidation against 
dissenting voices in Nicaragua; 
(2) urges the Ortega government to respect 
Nicaraguans’ constitutional rights and im-
plement the electoral reforms mentioned 
above in order to permit the holding of free, 
fair, and transparent elections; 
(3) encourages the United States Govern-
ment to align United States sanctions with 
diplomatic efforts to advance electoral re-
forms that could lead to free, fair, and trans-
parent elections in Nicaragua; 
(4) expresses full support for the people of 
Nicaragua, Nicaraguan independent media, 
and Nicaraguan civil society organizations 
that are working for a peaceful return to

(5) supports the efforts of the United 
States Government to apply pressure on the

f 
SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 472, S. Res. 533. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 533) supporting the 
goals of International Women’s Day. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
being no objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic, and with an amend-
ment to strike the preamble and insert 
the part printed in italic, as follows: 
S. RES. 533 
Whereas, as of March 2020, there are approxi-
mately 3,764,000,000 women and girls in the 
world; 
Whereas women and girls around the world— 
(1) have fundamental human rights; 
(2) play a critical role in providing and caring 
for their families and driving positive change in 
their communities; 
(3) contribute substantially to food security, 
economic growth, the prevention and resolution 
of conflict, and the sustainability of peace and 
stability; and 
(4) must have meaningful opportunities to 
more fully participate in and lead the political, 
social, and economic lives of their communities; 
Whereas the advancement and empowerment 
of women and girls around the world is a for-
eign policy priority for the United States and is 
critical to the achievement of global peace and 
prosperity; 
Whereas 2020 marks the anniversary of sig-
nificant 
milestones 
toward 
advancing 
the 
human rights and equality of women and girls, 
including— 
(1) the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage 
in the United States; and 
(2) the 20th anniversary of the Women, Peace, 
and Security Agenda, which was established 
through the unanimous adoption of United Na-
tions Security Council Resolution 1325 in Octo-
ber 2000; 
Whereas the National Security Strategy of the 
United States, published in December 2017— 
(1) declares that ‘‘[s]ocieties that empower 
women to participate fully in civic and economic 
life are more prosperous and peaceful’’; 
(2) supports ‘‘efforts to advance women’s 
equality, protect the rights of women and girls, 
and promote women and youth empowerment 
programs’’; and 
(3) recognizes that ‘‘governments that fail to 
treat women equally do not allow their societies 
to reach their potential’’; 
Whereas, on October 6, 2017, the Women, 
Peace, and Security Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 2152j 
et seq.) was enacted into law, which includes re-
quirements for a government-wide ‘‘Women, 
Peace, and Security Strategy’’ to promote and 
strengthen the participation of women in peace 
negotiations and conflict prevention overseas, 
enhanced training for relevant United States 
Government personnel, and follow-up evalua-
tions of the effectiveness of the strategy; 
Whereas the United States Strategy on 
Women, Peace, and Security, dated June 2019, 
recognizes that— 
(1) the ‘‘[s]ocial and political marginalization 
of women strongly correlates with the likelihood 
that a country will experience conflict’’; 
(2) there is a ‘‘tremendous amount of un-
tapped potential among the world’s women and 
girls to identify, recommend, and implement ef-
fective solutions to conflict’’, and there are 
‘‘benefits derived from creating opportunities for 
women and girls to serve as agents of peace via 
political, economic, and social empowerment’’; 
and 
(3) barriers to the meaningful participation of 
women and girls in conflict prevention and reso-
lution efforts ‘‘include under-representation in 
political leadership, pervasive violence against 
women and girls, and persistent inequality in 
many societies’’; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations En-
tity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment 
of Women (commonly referred to as ‘‘UN 
Women’’), peace negotiations are more likely to 
end in a peace agreement when women and 
women’s groups play a meaningful role in the 
negotiation process; 
Whereas, according to a study by the Inter-
national Peace Institute, a peace agreement is 
35 percent more likely to last at least 15 years if 
women participate in the development of the 
peace agreement; 
Whereas there are 83 national action plans re-
lating to the empowerment of women around the 
world, 11 regional action plans, and at least 9 
additional national action plans in develop-
ment; 
Whereas the joint strategy of the Department 
of State and the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) entitled ‘‘De-
partment of State & USAID Joint Strategy on 
Countering Violent Extremism’’ and dated May 
2016— 
(1) notes that women can play a critical role 
in identifying and addressing drivers of violent 
extremism in their families, communities, and 
broader society; and 
(2) commits to supporting programs that en-
gage women ‘‘as key stakeholders in preventing 
and countering violent extremism in their com-
munities’’; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of Inter-
national Narcotics and Law Enforcement Af-
fairs of the Department of State, the full and 
meaningful participation of women in criminal 
justice professions and security forces vastly en-
hances the effectiveness of the security forces; 
Whereas, despite the contributions of women 
to society, hundreds of millions of women and 
girls around the world continue to be denied the 
right to participate freely in civic and economic 
life, lack fundamental legal protections, and re-
main vulnerable to exploitation and abuse; 
Whereas, every year, approximately 12,000,000 
girls are married before they reach the age of 18, 
which means that— 
(1) nearly 33,000 girls are married every day; 
or 
(2) nearly 23 girls are married every minute; 
Whereas, despite global progress, it is pre-
dicted that by 2030 more than 150,000,000 more 
girls will marry before reaching the age of 18, 
and approximately 2,400,000 girls who are mar-
ried before reaching the age of 18 are under the 
age of 15; 
Whereas girls living in countries affected by 
conflict or other humanitarian crises are often 
the most vulnerable to child marriage, and 9 of 
the 10 countries with the highest rates of child 
marriage are considered fragile or extremely 
fragile;

Whereas, according to the International 
Labour Organization, 71 percent of the esti-
mated 40,300,000 victims of modern slavery in 
2016 were women or girls; 
Whereas, according to the United Nation’s 
Children’s Fund (commonly referred to as 
‘‘UNICEF’’)— 
(1) approximately 1⁄4 of girls between the ages 
of 15 and 19 have been victims of some form of 
physical violence; 
(2) approximately 120,000,000 girls worldwide, 
slightly more than 1 in 10, have experienced 
forced sexual acts; and 
(3) an estimated 1 in 3 women around the 
world has experienced some form of physical or 
sexual violence; 
Whereas, according to the 2018 report of the 
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime enti-
tled ‘‘Global Report on Trafficking in Persons’’, 
from 2003 to 2018, 72 percent of all detected traf-
ficking victims were women or girls; 
Whereas, on August 10, 2012, the United 
States Government launched a strategy entitled 
‘‘United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond 
to Gender-Based Violence Globally’’, which is 
the first interagency strategy that— 
(1) addresses gender-based violence around 
the world; 
(2) advances the rights and status of women 
and girls; 
(3) promotes gender equality in United States 
foreign policy; and 
(4) works to bring about a world in which all 
individuals can pursue their aspirations without 
the threat of violence; 
Whereas, in June 2016, the Department of 
State released an update to that strategy, un-
derscoring that ‘‘[p]reventing and responding to 
gender-based violence is a cornerstone of the 
U.S. Government’s commitment to advancing 
human rights and promoting gender equality 
and the empowerment of women and girls’’; 
Whereas, despite the achievements of indi-
vidual female leaders and evidence that democ-
racy and equality under the law form a mutu-
ally reinforcing relationship in which higher 
levels of equality are strongly correlated with 
the relative state of peace of a country, a 
healthier domestic security environment, and 
lower levels of aggression toward other coun-
tries— 
(1) women around the world remain vastly 
underrepresented in— 
(A) national and local legislatures and gov-
ernments; and 
(B) other high-level positions; and 
(2) according to the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union, women account for only 25 percent of 
national parliamentarians and 21 percent of 
government ministers; 
Whereas the ability of women and girls to re-
alize their full potential is critical to the ability 
of a country to achieve strong and lasting eco-
nomic growth, self-reliance, and political and 
social stability; 
Whereas the overall level of violence against 
women is a better predictor of the peacefulness 
of a country, the compliance of a country with 
international treaty obligations, and the rela-
tions of a country with neighboring countries 
than indicators measuring the level of democ-
racy, level of wealth, or level of institutionaliza-
tion of the country; 
Whereas, although the United Nations Millen-
nium Project reached the goal of achieving gen-
der parity in primary education in most coun-
tries in 2015, more work remains to be done to 
achieve gender equality in primary and sec-
ondary education, and particularly in sec-
ondary education worldwide as gender gaps per-
sist and widen, by addressing— 
(1) discriminatory practices; 
(2) harmful cultural and social norms; 
(3) inadequate sanitation facilities, including 
facilities to manage menstruation; 
(4) child, early, and forced marriage; 
(5) poverty; 
(6) early pregnancy and motherhood; 
(7) conflict and insecurity; and 
(8) other factors that favor boys or devalue 
girls’ education; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organiza-
tion— 
(1) approximately 132,000,000 girls between the 
ages of 6 and 17 remain out of school; 
(2) girls living in countries affected by conflict 
are 2.5 times more likely to be out of primary 
school than boys; 
(3) girls are twice as likely as boys to never set 
foot in a classroom; and 
(4) up to 30 percent of girls who drop out of 
school do so because of adolescent pregnancy or 
child marriage; 
Whereas women around the world face a vari-
ety of constraints that severely limit their eco-
nomic participation and productivity and re-
main underrepresented in the labor force; 
Whereas the economic empowerment of women 
is inextricably linked to a myriad of other 
human rights that are essential to the ability of 
women to thrive as economic actors, including— 
(1) living lives free of violence and exploi-
tation; 
(2) achieving the highest possible standard of 
health and well-being; 
(3) enjoying full legal and human rights, such 
as access to registration, identification, and citi-
zenship documents, and freedom of movement; 
(4) access to formal and informal education; 
(5) access to, and equal protection under, land 
and property rights; 
(6) access to fundamental labor rights; 
(7) the implementation of policies to address 
disproportionate care burdens; and 
(8) receiving business and management skills 
and leadership opportunities; 
Whereas closing the global gender gap in 
labor markets could increase worldwide gross 
domestic 
product 
by 
as 
much 
as 
$28,000,000,000,000 by 2025; 
Whereas, pursuant to section 3(b) of the Wom-
en’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empower-
ment Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 2151–2(b)), it is the 
international development cooperation policy of 
the United States— 
(1) to reduce gender disparities with respect to 
economic, social, political, educational, and cul-
tural resources, as well as wealth, opportunities, 
and services; 
(2) to strive to eliminate gender-based violence 
and mitigate its harmful effects on individuals 
and communities, including through efforts to 
develop standards and capacity to reduce gen-
der-based violence in the workplace and other 
places where women work; 
(3) to support activities that secure private 
property rights and land tenure for women in 
developing countries, including— 
(A) supporting legal frameworks that give 
women equal rights to own, register, use, prof-
it from, and inherit land and property; 
(B) improving legal literacy to enable 
women to exercise the rights described in sub-
paragraph (A); and 
(C) improving the capacity of law enforce-
ment and community leaders to enforce such 
rights; 
(4) to increase the capability of women and 
girls to fully exercise their rights, determine 
their life outcomes, assume leadership roles, and 
influence decision making in households, com-
munities, and societies; and 
(5) to improve the access of women and girls to 
education, particularly higher education oppor-
tunities in business, finance, and management, 
in order to enhance financial literacy and busi-
ness development, management, and strategy 
skills; 
Whereas, pursuant to National Security Presi-
dential Memorandum 16, entitled ‘‘Promoting 
Women’s Global Development and Prosperity’’, 
‘‘It is the policy of the United States to enhance 
the opportunity for women to meaningfully par-
ticipate in, contribute to, and benefit from eco-
nomic opportunities as individuals, workers, 
consumers, innovators, entrepreneurs, and in-
vestors, so that they enjoy the same access, 
rights, and opportunities as men to participate 
in, contribute to, control, and benefit from eco-
nomic activity.’’; 
Whereas, according to the World Health Orga-
nization, global maternal mortality decreased by 
approximately 44 percent between 1990 and 2015, 
yet approximately 830 women and girls continue 
to die from preventable causes relating to preg-
nancy or childbirth each day, and 99 percent of 
all maternal deaths occur in developing coun-
tries; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations, of 
the 830 women and adolescent girls who die 
every day from preventable causes relating to 
pregnancy and childbirth, 507 die each day in 
countries that are considered fragile because of 
conflict or disaster, accounting for approxi-
mately 3⁄5 of all maternal deaths worldwide; 
Whereas the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees reports that 
women and girls comprise approximately 1⁄2 of 
the 67,200,000 refugees and internally displaced 
or stateless individuals in the world; 
Whereas women and girls in humanitarian 
emergencies, including those subject to forced 
displacement, face increased and exacerbated 
vulnerabilities to— 
(1) gender-based violence, including, rape, 
child marriage, domestic violence, human traf-
ficking, and sexual exploitation and assault; 
(2) disruptions in education and livelihood; 
(3) lack of access to health services; and 
(4) food insecurity and malnutrition; 
Whereas malnutrition poses a variety of 
threats to women and girls specifically, as mal-
nutrition can weaken their immune systems, 
making them more susceptible to infections, and 
affects their capacity to survive childbirth, and 
children born of malnourished women and girls 
are more likely to have cognitive impairments 
and higher risk of disease throughout their 
lives; 
Whereas it is imperative— 
(1) to alleviate violence and discrimination 
against women and girls; and 
(2) to afford women and girls every oppor-
tunity to be full and productive members of their 
communities; and 
Whereas March 8, 2020, is recognized as Inter-
national Women’s Day, a global day— 
(1) to celebrate the economic, political, and so-
cial achievements of women in the past, present, 
and future; and 
(2) to recognize the obstacles that women face 
in the struggle for equal rights and opportuni-
ties: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of International Wom-
en’s Day; 
(2) recognizes that the fundamental human 
rights of women and girls have intrinsic value 
that affect the quality of life of women and 
girls; 
(3) recognizes that the empowerment of women 
and girls is inextricably linked to the potential 
of a country to generate— 
(A) economic growth and self-reliance; 
(B) sustainable peace and democracy; and 
(C) inclusive security; 
(4) recognizes and honors individuals in the 
United States and around the world, including 
women human rights defenders, activists, and 
civil society leaders, who have worked through-
out history to ensure that women and girls are 
guaranteed equality and fundamental human 
rights; 
(5) recognizes the unique cultural, historical, 
and religious differences throughout the world 
and urges the United States Government to act 
with respect and understanding toward legiti-
mate differences when promoting any policies; 
(6) reaffirms the commitment— 
(A) to end discrimination and violence against 
women and girls; 
(B) to ensure the safety, health, and welfare 
of women and girls;

Mr. GARDNER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the committee-reported sub-
stitute amendment to the resolution be 
agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment 
in the nature of a substitute was 
agreed to. 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I 
know of no further debate on the reso-
lution, as amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
Hearing none, the question is on 
adoption of the resolution, as amended. 
The resolution (S. Res. 533), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
Mr. GARDNER. I ask unanimous con-
sent 
that 
the 
committee-reported 
amendment to the preamble be agreed 
to; that the preamble, as amended, be 
agreed to; and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment 
to the preamble in the nature of a sub-
stitute was agreed to. 
The 
preamble, 
as 
amended, 
was 
agreed to. 
The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, as amended, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 533 
Whereas, as of March 2020, there are ap-
proximately 3,764,000,000 women and girls in 
the world; 
Whereas women and girls around the 
world— 
(1) have fundamental human rights; 
(2) play a critical role in providing and car-
ing for their families and driving positive 
change in their communities; 
(3) contribute substantially to food secu-
rity, economic growth, the prevention and 
resolution of conflict, and the sustainability 
of peace and stability; and 
(4) must have meaningful opportunities to 
more fully participate in and lead the polit-
ical, social, and economic lives of their com-
munities; 
Whereas the advancement and empower-
ment of women and girls around the world is 
a foreign policy priority for the United 
States and is critical to the achievement of 
global peace and prosperity; 
Whereas 2020 marks the anniversary of sig-
nificant milestones toward advancing the 
human rights and equality of women and 
girls, including— 
(1) the 100th anniversary of women’s suf-
frage in the United States; and 
(2) the 20th anniversary of the Women, 
Peace, and Security Agenda, which was es-
tablished through the unanimous adoption of 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1325 in October 2000; 
Whereas the National Security Strategy of 
the United States, published in December 
2017— 
(1) declares that ‘‘[s]ocieties that empower 
women to participate fully in civic and eco-
nomic life are more prosperous and peace-
ful’’; 
(2) supports ‘‘efforts to advance women’s 
equality, protect the rights of women and 
girls, and promote women and youth em-
powerment programs’’; and 
(3) recognizes that ‘‘governments that fail 
to treat women equally do not allow their 
societies to reach their potential’’; 
Whereas, on October 6, 2017, the Women, 
Peace, and Security Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 
2152j et seq.) was enacted into law, which in-
cludes requirements for a government-wide 
‘‘Women, Peace, and Security Strategy’’ to 
promote and strengthen the participation of 
women in peace negotiations and conflict 
prevention overseas, enhanced training for 
relevant United States Government per-
sonnel, and follow-up evaluations of the ef-
fectiveness of the strategy; 
Whereas the United States Strategy on 
Women, Peace, and Security, dated June 
2019, recognizes that— 
(1) 
the 
‘‘[s]ocial 
and 
political 
marginalization of women strongly cor-
relates with the likelihood that a country 
will experience conflict’’; 
(2) there is a ‘‘tremendous amount of un-
tapped potential among the world’s women 
and girls to identify, recommend, and imple-
ment effective solutions to conflict’’, and 
there are ‘‘benefits derived from creating op-
portunities for women and girls to serve as 
agents of peace via political, economic, and 
social empowerment’’; and 
(3) barriers to the meaningful participation 
of women and girls in conflict prevention 
and resolution efforts ‘‘include under-rep-
resentation in political leadership, pervasive 
violence against women and girls, and per-
sistent inequality in many societies’’; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Entity for Gender Equality and the Em-
powerment of Women (commonly referred to 
as ‘‘UN Women’’), peace negotiations are 
more likely to end in a peace agreement 
when women and women’s groups play a 
meaningful role in the negotiation process; 
Whereas, according to a study by the Inter-
national Peace Institute, a peace agreement 
is 35 percent more likely to last at least 15 
years if women participate in the develop-
ment of the peace agreement; 
Whereas there are 83 national action plans 
relating to the empowerment of women 
around the world, 11 regional action plans, 
and at least 9 additional national action 
plans in development; 
Whereas the joint strategy of the Depart-
ment of State and the United States Agency 
for International Development (USAID) enti-
tled ‘‘Department of State & USAID Joint 
Strategy on Countering Violent Extremism’’ 
and dated May 2016— 
(1) notes that women can play a critical 
role in identifying and addressing drivers of 
violent extremism in their families, commu-
nities, and broader society; and 
(2) commits to supporting programs that 
engage women ‘‘as key stakeholders in pre-
venting and countering violent extremism in 
their communities’’; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of Inter-
national Narcotics and Law Enforcement Af-
fairs of the Department of State, the full and 
meaningful participation of women in crimi-
nal justice professions and security forces 
vastly enhances the effectiveness of the secu-
rity forces; 
Whereas, 
despite 
the 
contributions 
of 
women to society, hundreds of millions of 
women and girls around the world continue 
to be denied the right to participate freely in 
civic and economic life, lack fundamental 
legal protections, and remain vulnerable to 
exploitation and abuse; 
Whereas, 
every 
year, 
approximately 
12,000,000 girls are married before they reach 
the age of 18, which means that— 
(1) nearly 33,000 girls are married every 
day; or 
(2) nearly 23 girls are married every 
minute; 
Whereas, despite global progress, it is pre-
dicted that by 2030 more than 150,000,000 
more girls will marry before reaching the 
age of 18, and approximately 2,400,000 girls 
who are married before reaching the age of 18 
are under the age of 15; 
Whereas girls living in countries affected 
by conflict or other humanitarian crises are 
often the most vulnerable to child marriage, 
and 9 of the 10 countries with the highest 
rates of child marriage are considered fragile 
or extremely fragile; 
Whereas, according to the International 
Labour Organization, 71 percent of the esti-
mated 40,300,000 victims of modern slavery in 
2016 were women or girls; 
Whereas, according to the United Nation’s 
Children’s Fund (commonly referred to as 
‘‘UNICEF’’)— 
(1) approximately 1⁄4 of girls between the 
ages of 15 and 19 have been victims of some 
form of physical violence; 
(2) approximately 120,000,000 girls world-
wide, slightly more than 1 in 10, have experi-
enced forced sexual acts; and 
(3) an estimated 1 in 3 women around the 
world has experienced some form of physical 
or sexual violence; 
Whereas, according to the 2018 report of 
the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime entitled ‘‘Global Report on Traf-
ficking in Persons’’, from 2003 to 2018, 72 per-
cent of all detected trafficking victims were 
women or girls; 
Whereas, on August 10, 2012, the United 
States Government launched a strategy enti-
tled ‘‘United States Strategy to Prevent and 
Respond to Gender-Based Violence Glob-
ally’’, which is the first interagency strategy 
that— 
(1) addresses gender-based violence around 
the world; 
(2) advances the rights and status of 
women and girls; 
(3) promotes gender equality in United 
States foreign policy; and 
(4) works to bring about a world in which 
all individuals can pursue their aspirations 
without the threat of violence; 
Whereas, in June 2016, the Department of 
State released an update to that strategy, 
underscoring that ‘‘[p]reventing and respond-
ing to gender-based violence is a cornerstone 
of the U.S. Government’s commitment to ad-
vancing human rights and promoting gender 
equality and the empowerment of women 
and girls’’; 
Whereas, despite the achievements of indi-
vidual female leaders and evidence that de-
mocracy and equality under the law form a 
mutually reinforcing relationship in which 
higher levels of equality are strongly cor-
related with the relative state of peace of a 
country, a healthier domestic security envi-
ronment, and lower levels of aggression to-
ward other countries— 
(1) women around the world remain vastly 
underrepresented in— 
(A) national and local legislatures and 
governments; and 
(B) other high-level positions; and 
(2) according to the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union, women account for only 25 percent of 
national parliamentarians and 21 percent of 
government ministers; 
Whereas the ability of women and girls to 
realize their full potential is critical to the 
ability of a country to achieve strong and

lasting economic growth, self-reliance, and 
political and social stability; 
Whereas the overall level of violence 
against women is a better predictor of the 
peacefulness of a country, the compliance of 
a country with international treaty obliga-
tions, and the relations of a country with 
neighboring countries than indicators meas-
uring the level of democracy, level of wealth, 
or level of institutionalization of the coun-
try; 
Whereas, although the United Nations Mil-
lennium Project reached the goal of achiev-
ing gender parity in primary education in 
most countries in 2015, more work remains 
to be done to achieve gender equality in pri-
mary and secondary education, and particu-
larly in secondary education worldwide as 
gender gaps persist and widen, by address-
ing— 
(1) discriminatory practices; 
(2) harmful cultural and social norms; 
(3) inadequate sanitation facilities, includ-
ing facilities to manage menstruation; 
(4) child, early, and forced marriage; 
(5) poverty; 
(6) early pregnancy and motherhood; 
(7) conflict and insecurity; and 
(8) other factors that favor boys or devalue 
girls’ education; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organi-
zation— 
(1) approximately 132,000,000 girls between 
the ages of 6 and 17 remain out of school; 
(2) girls living in countries affected by con-
flict are 2.5 times more likely to be out of 
primary school than boys; 
(3) girls are twice as likely as boys to never 
set foot in a classroom; and 
(4) up to 30 percent of girls who drop out of 
school do so because of adolescent pregnancy 
or child marriage; 
Whereas women around the world face a 
variety of constraints that severely limit 
their economic participation and produc-
tivity and remain underrepresented in the 
labor force; 
Whereas the economic empowerment of 
women is inextricably linked to a myriad of 
other human rights that are essential to the 
ability of women to thrive as economic ac-
tors, including— 
(1) living lives free of violence and exploi-
tation; 
(2) achieving the highest possible standard 
of health and well-being; 
(3) enjoying full legal and human rights, 
such as access to registration, identification, 
and citizenship documents, and freedom of 
movement; 
(4) access to formal and informal edu-
cation; 
(5) access to, and equal protection under, 
land and property rights; 
(6) access to fundamental labor rights; 
(7) the implementation of policies to ad-
dress disproportionate care burdens; and 
(8) receiving business and management 
skills and leadership opportunities; 
Whereas closing the global gender gap in 
labor markets could increase worldwide 
gross domestic product by as much as 
$28,000,000,000,000 by 2025; 
Whereas, pursuant to section 3(b) of the 
Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic 
Empowerment Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 2151– 
2(b)), it is the international development co-
operation policy of the United States— 
(1) to reduce gender disparities with re-
spect to economic, social, political, edu-
cational, and cultural resources, as well as 
wealth, opportunities, and services; 
(2) to strive to eliminate gender-based vio-
lence and mitigate its harmful effects on in-
dividuals 
and 
communities, 
including 
through efforts to develop standards and ca-
pacity to reduce gender-based violence in the 
workplace and other places where women 
work; 
(3) to support activities that secure private 
property rights and land tenure for women in 
developing countries, including— 
(A) supporting legal frameworks that 
give women equal rights to own, register, 
use, profit from, and inherit land and prop-
erty; 
(B) improving legal literacy to enable 
women to exercise the rights described in 
subparagraph (A); and 
(C) improving the capacity of law en-
forcement and community leaders to en-
force such rights; 
(4) to increase the capability of women and 
girls to fully exercise their rights, determine 
their life outcomes, assume leadership roles, 
and influence decision making in households, 
communities, and societies; and 
(5) to improve the access of women and 
girls to education, particularly higher edu-
cation opportunities in business, finance, 
and management, in order to enhance finan-
cial literacy and business development, man-
agement, and strategy skills; 
Whereas, pursuant to National Security 
Presidential Memorandum 16, entitled ‘‘Pro-
moting Women’s Global Development and 
Prosperity’’, ‘‘It is the policy of the United 
States to enhance the opportunity for 
women to meaningfully participate in, con-
tribute to, and benefit from economic oppor-
tunities as individuals, workers, consumers, 
innovators, entrepreneurs, and investors, so 
that they enjoy the same access, rights, and 
opportunities as men to participate in, con-
tribute to, control, and benefit from eco-
nomic activity.’’; 
Whereas, according to the World Health 
Organization, global maternal mortality de-
creased by approximately 44 percent between 
1990 and 2015, yet approximately 830 women 
and girls continue to die from preventable 
causes relating to pregnancy or childbirth 
each day, and 99 percent of all maternal 
deaths occur in developing countries; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations, 
of the 830 women and adolescent girls who 
die every day from preventable causes relat-
ing to pregnancy and childbirth, 507 die each 
day in countries that are considered fragile 
because of conflict or disaster, accounting 
for approximately 3⁄5 of all maternal deaths 
worldwide; 
Whereas the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees reports that 
women and girls comprise approximately 1⁄2 
of the 67,200,000 refugees and internally dis-
placed or stateless individuals in the world; 
Whereas women and girls in humanitarian 
emergencies, including those subject to 
forced displacement, face increased and exac-
erbated vulnerabilities to— 
(1) gender-based violence, including, rape, 
child marriage, domestic violence, human 
trafficking, and sexual exploitation and as-
sault; 
(2) disruptions in education and livelihood; 
(3) lack of access to health services; and 
(4) food insecurity and malnutrition; 
Whereas malnutrition poses a variety of 
threats to women and girls specifically, as 
malnutrition can weaken their immune sys-
tems, making them more susceptible to in-
fections, and affects their capacity to sur-
vive childbirth, and children born of mal-
nourished women and girls are more likely 
to have cognitive impairments and higher 
risk of disease throughout their lives; 
Whereas it is imperative— 
(1) to alleviate violence and discrimination 
against women and girls; and 
(2) to afford women and girls every oppor-
tunity to be full and productive members of 
their communities; and 
Whereas March 8, 2020, is recognized as 
International Women’s Day, a global day— 
(1) to celebrate the economic, political, 
and social achievements of women in the 
past, present, and future; and 
(2) to recognize the obstacles that women 
face in the struggle for equal rights and op-
portunities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of International 
Women’s Day; 
(2) recognizes that the fundamental human 
rights of women and girls have intrinsic 
value that affect the quality of life of women 
and girls; 
(3) recognizes that the empowerment of 
women and girls is inextricably linked to the 
potential of a country to generate— 
(A) economic growth and self-reliance; 
(B) sustainable peace and democracy; and 
(C) inclusive security; 
(4) recognizes and honors individuals in the 
United States and around the world, includ-
ing women human rights defenders, activ-
ists, and civil society leaders, who have 
worked throughout history to ensure that 
women and girls are guaranteed equality and 
fundamental human rights; 
(5) recognizes the unique cultural, histor-
ical, and religious differences throughout the 
world and urges the United States Govern-
ment to act with respect and understanding 
toward legitimate differences when pro-
moting any policies; 
(6) reaffirms the commitment— 
(A) to end discrimination and violence 
against women and girls; 
(B) to ensure the safety, health, and wel-
fare of women and girls; 
(C) to pursue policies that guarantee the 
fundamental human rights of women and 
girls worldwide; and 
(D) to promote meaningful and significant 
participation of women in every aspect of so-
ciety and community, including conflict pre-
vention, 
protection, 
peacemaking, 
and 
peacebuilding; 
(7) supports sustainable, measurable, and 
global development that seeks to achieve 
gender equality and the empowerment of 
women and girls; and 
(8) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe International Women’s 
Day with appropriate programs and activi-
ties.

(1) was the first concentration camp estab-
lished by the German National Socialist, or 
‘‘Nazi’’, government; 
(2) served as a model for all subsequent Nazi 
concentration camps; 
(3) was a training center for the notoriously 
brutal SS concentration camp guards; and 
(4) operated continuously until the end of 
World War II in 1945; 
Whereas the Dachau concentration camp 
housed Germans who were deemed political, ra-
cial, or social threats by the Nazi regime, includ-
ing Communists, Social Democrats, Jews, Roma, 
members of the clergy, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and 
other religious and cultural minorities; 
Whereas, in addition to Germans, prisoners at 
the Dachau concentration camp included Poles, 
Hungarians, Austrians, Italians, Lithuanians, 
Czechs, Slovenes, Belgians, and other foreign 
nationals from countries occupied or invaded by 
Germany; 
Whereas the Nazis imprisoned more than 
200,000 civilians in the Dachau concentration 
camp and the more than 100 subcamps of the 
Dachau concentration camp; 
Whereas the Nazis murdered tens of thou-
sands of innocent civilians, and allowed count-
less others to die from disease, starvation, mal-
nutrition, and exhaustion, at the Dachau con-
centration camp, one of many camps where the 
Nazis brutally killed millions of people, includ-
ing 6,000,000 Jews during the Holocaust; 
Whereas the Nazis tortured, and conducted 
medical experiments that led to the death or per-
manent disabling of, hundreds of civilian pris-
oners at the Dachau concentration camp, in-
cluding by— 
(1) subjecting the prisoners to pressure ex-
tremes; 
(2) submersing the prisoners in freezing water; 
(3) forcing the prisoners to drink salt water; 
and 
(4) infecting the prisoners with malaria; 
Whereas the Nazis subjected civilian prisoners 
at the Dachau concentration camp to forced 
labor— 
(1) first for the initial construction and expan-
sion of the camp; and 
(2) later primarily for armaments production 
to supply the German military; 
Whereas, following the advance of Allied 
Forces, the Nazi regime began the systematic 
transfer of prisoners from evacuated concentra-
tion camps to the Dachau concentration camp 
for continued imprisonment, resulting in the 
deaths of thousands of weakened and malnour-
ished prisoners and leading to the discovery of 
the infamous ‘‘Dachau death train’’, consisting 
of nearly 40 railroad cars containing the bodies 
of approximately 2,310 prisoners; 
Whereas, in December 1943, Dwight D. Eisen-
hower was appointed as Supreme Commander of 
the Allied Expeditionary Forces and led the for-
mal coordination of the Allied Forces, with the 
mission to liberate Europe; 
Whereas the main Dachau concentration 
camp was liberated on April 29, 1945; 
Whereas that liberation was led by— 
(1) the 45th Infantry ‘‘Thunderbird’’ Division 
of the Seventh Army of the United States (re-
ferred to in this preamble as the ‘‘45th Infantry 
Division’’), under the leadership of Lieutenant 
Colonel Felix Sparks, member of the Colorado 
Army National Guard and Commander of the 
Third Battalion of the 157th Infantry Regiment 
of the 45th Infantry Division; 
(2) the 42nd Infantry ‘‘Rainbow’’ Division of 
the Seventh Army of the United States (referred 
to in this preamble as the ‘‘42nd Infantry Divi-
sion’’), under the leadership of Brigadier Gen-
eral Henning Linden; and 
(3) the 20th Armored Division of the Seventh 
Army of the United States (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘20th Armored Division’’); 
Whereas the 45th Infantry Division— 
(1) was composed of National Guard units 
from Colorado, Oklahoma, Arizona, and New 
Mexico; and 
(2) deployed in June 1943 in support of the Al-
lied Forces during World War II; 
Whereas the 42nd Infantry Division— 
(1) was composed of personnel from every 
State of the United States; and 
(2) deployed in December 1944 in support of 
the Allied Forces during World War II; 
Whereas the 20th Armored Division— 
(1) was activated at Fort Campbell and, until 
October of 1944, trained soldiers and qualified 
those soldiers for overseas shipment as replace-
ment soldiers for armored units; and 
(2) deployed in February 1945 in support of 
the Allied Forces during World War II; 
Whereas, in the European theater of oper-
ation, the 45th Infantry Division suffered— 
(1) 1,831 deaths in battle; and 
(2) 7,791 battle casualties; 
Whereas, in the European theater of oper-
ation, the 42nd Infantry Division suffered— 
(1) 655 deaths in battle; and 
(2) 3,971 battle casualties; 
Whereas, in the European theater of oper-
ation, the 20th Armored Division suffered— 
(1) 59 deaths in battle; and 
(2) 186 battle casualties; 
Whereas, in 1985, the United States Army Cen-
ter of Military History and the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum honored the 45th 
Infantry Division, the 42nd Infantry Division, 
and the 20th Armored Division with recognition 
as ‘‘liberating units’’; and 
Whereas commemoration of the liberation of 
the Dachau concentration camp will instill in 
all people of the United States a greater aware-
ness of the unspeakable tragedies of the Holo-
caust: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates April 29, 2020, as the 75th 
anniversary of the liberation of the Dachau 
concentration camp during World War II; 
(2) calls on all people of the United States to 
remember the tens of thousands of innocent vic-
tims murdered at the Dachau concentration 
camp as part of the Holocaust, the 6,000,000 
Jews killed throughout the Holocaust, and all of 
the victims of the Nazi reign of terror; and 
(3) recognizes the valorous efforts of the 45th 
Infantry Division, the 42nd Infantry Division, 
and the 20th Armored Division of the Seventh 
Army of the United States in the liberation of 
the thousands of individuals imprisoned at the 
Dachau concentration camp. 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the com-
mittee-reported substitute amendment 
to the resolution be agreed to; that the 
resolution, as amended, be agreed to; 
that the committee-reported amend-
ment to the preamble be agreed to; 
that the preamble, as amended, be 
agreed to; and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment 
in the nature of a substitute was 
agreed to. 
The resolution (S. Res. 542), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
The committee-reported amendment 
to the preamble was agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, as amended, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 542 
Whereas the Dachau concentration camp, 
established in March 1933— 
(1) was the first concentration camp estab-
lished by the German National Socialist, or 
‘‘Nazi’’, government; 
(2) served as a model for all subsequent 
Nazi concentration camps; 
(3) was a training center for the notori-
ously brutal SS concentration camp guards; 
and 
(4) operated continuously until the end of 
World War II in 1945; 
Whereas the Dachau concentration camp 
housed Germans who were deemed political, 
racial, or social threats by the Nazi regime, 
including Communists, Social Democrats, 
Jews, Roma, members of the clergy, Jeho-
vah’s Witnesses, and other religious and cul-
tural minorities; 
Whereas, in addition to Germans, prisoners 
at the Dachau concentration camp included 
Poles, Hungarians, Austrians, Italians, Lith-
uanians, Czechs, Slovenes, Belgians, and 
other foreign nationals from countries occu-
pied or invaded by Germany; 
Whereas the Nazis imprisoned more than 
200,000 civilians in the Dachau concentration

40 railroad cars containing the bodies of ap-
proximately 2,310 prisoners;

Center of Military History and the United
