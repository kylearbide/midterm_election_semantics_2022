DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE

fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Create in us pure hearts, O God, and 
recreate within us this day new and 
steadfast spirits. 
Be our judge. When we find ourselves 
caught up in the love of triumph, 
transform us. Redeem our appetite for 
fighting and winning. Beat the swords 
we wield against others into tools that, 
instead, carve out safe places for dia-
logue and collaboration. 
Be our arbitrator. Disrupt our incli-
nation to fight and win. Redeem our 
deep desire to conquer our adversaries 
and recast our spears into instruments 
that serve to reveal our best selves. 
Be our guide. Teach us something 
other than conflict. Redeem our pre-
disposition to demonize or demean the 
other and form in us habits of decency 
and civility, honor, and respect. 
We surrender ourselves to this rad-
ical transformation and yield ourselves 
to the redemption that Your love offers 
us. 
Restore to us the joy of Your salva-
tion and grant within us a willing spir-
it that we would be sustained in our 
service to You in this time. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

Ms. NORTON led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the

DEMOCRATS CREATING NEW 
ECONOMY WITH RECORD JOBS 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, this 
month’s job report gives Americans 
something to cheer about. Unemploy-
ment is down a full 2 percentage points 
under Democratic congressional and 
Presidential leadership since President 
Biden took office. The corollary to this 
impressive unemployment figure is the 
record 6 million jobs created, a record 
for a new President. 
With the signing of the new transpor-
tation and infrastructure bill, more 
jobs, for example, in my own district, 
the District of Columbia, are on the 
way—$1.1 billion for roads and bridges. 
Build Back Better promises even 
more economic dividends. Analysts say 
Build Back Better is the biggest cost- 
cutting bill for the middle class in 
modern American history. With costs 
down, job growth will be spurred. 
Democrats are creating a new econ-
omy featuring record jobs for the 
American people. 
f 
HONORING THE PASSING OF 
CAROL JENKINS BARNETT 
(Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor 
of 
the 
passing 
of 
Carol 
Jenkins 
Barnett. 
Carol was the daughter of Publix 
Super Markets founder George Jen-
kins. She carried the mantle of gen-
erosity and philanthropy on behalf of 
the Jenkins family and Publix Super 
Market Charities, benefiting the resi-
dents of Lakeland, Polk County, the 
State of Florida, and beyond. 
Carol had a remarkable love for her 
family and for the families of our com-
munity, advocating especially for chil-
dren and early childhood education 
with her time and talent as well as her 
treasure. 
She impacted so many people and so 
many communities in ways both seen 
and unseen. Quite simply, I have never 
known a more generous person than 
Carol Jenkins Barnett. 
We will be praying for Carol’s hus-
band, Barney; their sons, Wesley and 
Nicholas; and their families as they 
mourn the loss of this exceptional 
woman. 
Carol will be missed, but her legacy 
endures in the generations she has 
touched.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7560 
December 9, 2021 
ATTACKS ON ELECTIONS MUST BE 
STOPPED 
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I have 
been to every nook and cranny of the 
region I represent. I have never spoken 
to anyone anywhere who thought elect-
ed officials should be able to use their 
public office for personal profit. 
I have never spoken to anyone any-
where who believes that elected offi-
cials should be able to interfere in 
independent investigations or to pun-
ish whistleblowers. 
I have never spoken to anyone any-
where in my district who thinks we 
should allow foreign countries to inter-
fere in our elections. 
Addressing these issues is what the 
Protecting Our Democracy Act is all 
about. 
Importantly, this bill includes the 
Honest Ads Act, a bill that I led to in-
crease accountability for online polit-
ical ads. There are disclaimer require-
ments for print, broadcast, and radio 
ads, and our bipartisan bill would set 
those same requirements for online ads 
so that the American people can know 
who is paying for the ads they are see-
ing online and so we can keep foreign 
money out. 
We know that foreign adversaries 
have attacked our elections in the 
past, and we have to stop it. That is 
why I am proud to cosponsor this legis-
lation, and I encourage my colleagues 
to pass this bill today. 
f 
HONORING VICTOR GARZA ON HIS 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. CLOUD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Victor Garza and to 
wish him a happy 100th birthday. 
Victor Garza is a World War II vet-
eran who is devoted to his family, his 
faith, and service to this country. He 
joined the United States Navy at the 
age of 22 and served in the Pacific the-
ater during World War II. 
During his service, he worked as a 
heavy equipment operator in the Sea-
bee construction battalion and was sta-
tioned in Japan where he assisted with 
efforts to free prisoners of war. 
After his service to his country, he 
devoted himself to his community, 
building homes and businesses across 
Victoria, Texas, and being an active 
member of the VFW and the CWV. He 
also devoted himself to his family, 
raising seven children with Amalia, his 
wife of 74 years. 
Victor is a true hero and an example 
to all of us of what it means to be an 
American. I am proud to honor him 
today and hope he has a wonderful 
100th birthday. 
CREATING A STRONG ECONOMY 
FOR ALL AMERICANS 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, as 
the pandemic put pressure on the pock-
ets of Americans, House Democrats 
worked to not only bolster our econ-
omy but to get people back to work. 
The November jobs report shows that 
our economy is on the right track to 
doing just that. In fact, 6 million jobs 
have been created in the first 10 
months of the Biden administration. 
No other administration has created 
more jobs in its first year. But during 
the 
Trump 
administration’s 
mis-
management of the pandemic, we lost 
over 9 million jobs. So we still have 
work to do. 
The 
recently 
House-passed 
Build 
Back Better Act will include specific 
and urgent measures to uplift working 
families, lower everyday costs, fight 
inflation, and generate millions of 
good-paying jobs. 
House Democrats remain committed 
to creating a strong economy and an 
economy that works for all Americans. 
f 
BENEFITS OF VITAMIN D 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, as 
the Congress prepares to break for 
Christmas, it is important to review 
one more time what we can do to deal 
with the coronavirus. 
While vaccines unquestionably have 
a role here, I am a little bit appalled at 
the lack of information coming from 
the public health establishment regard-
ing vitamin D. Tests show that ade-
quate levels of vitamin D can reduce 
the amount of COVID cases by up to 75 
percent, which is good, including for 
people who have taken the vaccine. 
Right now, Madam Speaker, experts 
feel you should have at least 30 
nanograms per milliliter to have ade-
quate amounts of vitamin D. Right 
now, 65 percent of our White popu-
lation, 87 percent of our Hispanic popu-
lation, and 96 percent of our Black pop-
ulation do not have adequate vitamin 
D levels. 
The public health establishment has 
to be asked: Why is this not publicized? 
Why do we not give routine vitamin D 
tests to people coming in for their an-
nual checkups? And why, if you show 
up at the hospital with COVID, are not 
vitamin D tests automatic? 
I ask public health establishments to 
please familiarize themselves with the 
benefits of vitamin D and the role it 
plays. 
f 
EFFECTS OF CORONAVIRUS ON 
ECONOMY 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, the 
President has done an excellent job on 
trying to address our economic prob-
lems, and one of the main reasons we 
have economic problems is because of 
the coronavirus. 
The President has an excellent vac-
cination program that the Republicans, 
unfortunately, are fighting. As people 
have experienced the pandemic, they 
have been less willing to go out and en-
gage in commerce and travel and had 
to reduce some of their business activi-
ties. This has hurt the supply chain 
and hurt our economy. So the Presi-
dent’s vaccine plan is also an economic 
plan. 
Republicans in the Senate led an ef-
fort to cancel all the vaccination pro-
grams that the President has to pro-
tect us, to keep us healthy, and to 
move our economy forward. That is un-
fortunate. We need to support these 
vaccination plans, and we need to sup-
port the President in these efforts. 
Inflation has been a problem. The 
President has released some oil from 
the reserve to help deal with gas prices. 
Gas prices are going down, and they 
will go down naturally. 
One of the great reasons why infla-
tion has increased is because of used 
car prices. You have to think about 
when used car prices go up, Madam 
Speaker, somebody is selling that used 
car, and they are getting more money 
to put in their pocket. Things are get-
ting better. 
God bless New Mexico. 
f 
HONORING NEWSCHANNEL 9 
ANCHOR DAN CUMMINGS 
(Mr. KATKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the renowned 37-year 
career of NewsChannel 9 anchor Dan 
Cummings. 
For nearly four decades, Dan Cum-
mings has been one of the most trusted 
names in local news and has earned a 
well-deserved reputation for his integ-
rity and investigative prowess. 
A native of Cayuga County, Dan 
Cummings grew up in central New 
York and got his start in journalism 
working at local radio stations. In 1984, 
Dan 
Cummings 
joined 
the 
NewsChannel 9 team and, in 2008, began 
anchoring the morning news. Notably, 
Dan was the driving force behind 
‘‘Newsmakers,’’ a weekly public affairs 
program. 
In these prominent roles, Dan Cum-
mings has been celebrated for his abil-
ity to conduct smart, original report-
ing and communicate even the most 
difficult stories in a calm and straight-
forward manner. 
I have known Dan Cummings for 
many years. I can unequivocally say he 
is one of the most fair and genuine 
news professionals and is an extremely 
generous man who is actively involved 
in multiple charities. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues in the House join me in hon-
oring Dan Cummings for an incredible

wishing him the best in his retirement. 
f 
CHILD TAX CREDIT 
(Ms. ROSS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss an important lifeline 
to so many North Carolina families, 
the child tax credit. 
In North Carolina alone, millions of 
families have benefited from the child 
tax credit. The first monthly payment 
lifted 3 million children out of poverty 
and significantly reduced childhood 
hunger. No family should have to 
worry about whether they can afford 
their next meal. 
The child tax credit also helps pay 
for childcare, helps pay for school sup-
plies, helps when the car breaks down, 
and helps families living paycheck to 
paycheck. 
Recently, I heard from a mother in 
North Carolina who told me that the 
child tax credit takes away a layer of 
stress that is inherent in trying to re-
turn to the workforce and financially 
plan for a new setting. 
In just a few weeks, these monthly 
payments are set to expire unless Build 
Back Better is passed. We cannot fail 
the next generation. We must pass this 
transformative legislation in the Sen-
ate and have the President sign it.

BIDEN ENERGY CRISIS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, incredibly, President 
Biden said Tuesday: ‘‘We’re making 
progress.’’ And ‘‘American people are 
paying their fair share for gas.’’ 
However, the reality is Americans 
are paying 61 percent more for gas, and 
home heating oil costs will jump 54 
percent. 
The disastrous Biden agenda has put 
America in an energy crisis. He killed 
the Keystone pipeline with 11,000 jobs 
lost. And executive orders have paused 
new oil and gas leasing, costing over 1 
million jobs. Annual Biden inflation is 
the highest in 40 years, destroying jobs. 
The Democrat elite think they are 
better than everyone, and they believe 
Democrat voters and Democrat media 
are ignorant to accept $4.5 trillion 
‘‘costs zero dollars.’’ 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who have successfully protected Amer-
ica for 20 years, as the global war on 
terrorism now is moving from the Af-
ghanistan safe haven to America. 
Congratulations, Norma and John 
Jett and Roxanne Wilson on their new 
grandson born yesterday, Hunter Tay-
lor Wilson, Jr., of West Columbia, 
South Carolina. 
HONORING FRED ANDES 
(Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
my good friend, Fred Andes, of Chi-
cago, on receiving J Street’s highest 
honor, the Tzedek v’Shalom Award. 
This is the Justice and Peace Award. 
No one is more deserving than Fred. 
I am honored to call him a good friend 
and be close with his family, including 
his lovely wife, Melanie. 
He is empathetic, Fred is generous, 
and he is a leader in the community. 
Fred practices the ancient expression 
‘‘tikkun olam’’ every day in repairing 
the world. 
He serves as a co-chair of the U.S. 
International Advisory Committee for 
EcoPeace Middle East. He is also a lay 
co-chair of the Joint Israel Committee 
for the Reconstructing Judaism move-
ment. And he has served as a critical 
member of J Street’s Chicago Execu-
tive Committee. 
Fred is one of those people whose ac-
tions speak louder than words. We are 
so honored by his presence in the com-
munity. 
Congratulations to Fred, again, in re-
ceiving the Tzedek v’Shalom Award. 
f 
TRANSPARENT BIPARTISAN 
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, the 
American people deserve a transparent 
and bipartisan legislative process, but 
that is apparently not what the Demo-
crat majority wants. 
Unfortunately, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle continually man-
ufacture crisis after crisis by waiting 
until deadlines are immediately upon 
us before addressing the issues at hand. 
And when we are up against a deadline, 
it gives the majority leverage to limit 
opposition and allows them to ram 
harmful 
bills 
through 
this 
House, 
claiming they are necessities. 
They have done it with multiple con-
tinuing resolutions. They did it with 
the Surface Transportation Reauthor-
ization Act. And now, after having al-
ready punted responsibility once on the 
issue, they are doing it again on rais-
ing the debt ceiling, as a default looms 
less than a week away. 
We must stop fanning the flames of 
fires where the tools exist to extin-
guish them. Democrats legislating in 
this manner creates uncertainty and 
spooks the market, which contributes 
to the twin economic crisis and energy 
crisis, both of which this administra-
tion has done nothing to address. 
For our economy to truly recover, we 
must ensure the government is work-
ing efficiently and effectively on behalf 
of the American people. 
SUPPORT AMERICAN FAMILIES 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to support American fami-
lies. And as I do that, I am sad to say 
that the Texas workforce sent almost a 
two-page, small-type letter to Texans 
around the State to tell them that 
they could ignore the President’s man-
date on vaccines, as the omicron vari-
ant rises, and as hospitals are begin-
ning to teem over with the delta vari-
ant. 
Isn’t that sad? 
To my fellow Texans, do what is 
right for your family. Get your chil-
dren vaccinated. Get your booster, or 
your first or second shot. Let us save 
lives. 
I am saddened by government tax 
dollars being used to counter and dis-
tort the President’s mandates and the 
President’s desire to impact the lives 
of Americans. 
To also impact the lives of Ameri-
cans, I intend to introduce the Kim-
berly Vaughan storage bill. In light of 
what happened in Oakland County and 
the tragedy of a family leaving a gun— 
as they gave it to a child for a birth-
day—but leaving it accessible to that 
child, four precious lives are lost. 
I think this is certainly bipartisan 
legislation to create the opportunity 
for you to buy a gun, but to have the 
message, storage is important. This 
bill will provide a variety of best prac-
tices and penalties for those that do 
not store their guns. 
Support me in the Kimberly Vaughan 
storage bill to make sure that we do 
what is right for our children. Store 
your guns and make them safe.

LEGACY OF DAVID PANKO 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize an ordinary citizen of Patton 
Township in Centre County, David 
Panko. 
For the past 22 years, David served as 
president of the Patton Township Busi-
ness Association. In his role as presi-

tween the association, the community, 
and the Patton Township Police. 
In 2002, David worked to establish the 
Patton 
Township 
Children’s 
Safety 
Fair, a community event focused on 
building trust between residents and 
their police officers, firefighters, and 
EMS responders in Centre County. 
David will be remembered as a leader 
who worked to make his community a 
better place. He rebuilt the organiza-
tion into a group full of gracious and 
welcoming members.

ton Township Business Association has

f 
UNDENIABLE CRISIS AT OUR 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
VALADAO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
what we are seeing at our southern bor-
der is an undeniable crisis. An unthink-
able amount of fentanyl and fentanyl- 
related substances are coming across 
our border. There is enough fentanyl 
coming across our border to kill every 
American seven times over. Think 
about that. 
This only exacerbates our existing 
drug problem in the United States, like 
the rising use of meth in the Central 
Valley of California. 
In October, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection apprehended over 160,000 il-
legal immigrants attempting to cross 
our southern border, the highest num-
ber of apprehensions for October on 
record. 
I have always been supportive of im-
migration. After all, I am the son of 
immigrants. But we have to respect 
and enforce our laws. By refusing to 
enforce immigration laws, this admin-
istration is sending a dangerous mes-
sage that our border is open for busi-
ness to cartels and encourages people 
to put themselves in harm’s way to 
cross our border. 
f 
FENTANYL CRISIS 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to address the un-
imaginable 
amount 
of 
dangerous 
fentanyl and related substances that 
are 
crossing 
our 
southern 
border, 
enough to kill every American seven 
times over. 
Criminal drug cartels are capital-
izing on the lack of security due to 
Biden’s 
open-border 
policies. 
Since 
these large amounts of fentanyl are 
flooding in, the DEA issued its first 
public safety alert in 6 years, warning 
the public about fake pills laced with 
lethal doses of fentanyl, and we are 
seeing the devastating effects. 
Synthetic 
opioids, 
primarily 
fentanyl, account for nearly two-thirds 
of 
the 
overdose 
deaths, 
including 
American 
teenagers. 
Many 
parents 
across our country, and including my 
home State of Oklahoma, have trag-
ically lost their children to accidental 
fentanyl overdoses. No one should ever 
have to experience that sort of pain. 
In February, we have the chance to 
respond. 
The 
emergency 
class-wide 
scheduling order for fentanyl-related 
substances is set to expire. Democrats 
want to enact only temporary exten-
sions, while Republicans are fighting to 
make it permanent. 
Madam Speaker, there are deadly 
consequences to the lack of security at 
the border. We must ensure law en-
forcement has the resources to protect 
our country and keep those drugs out 
of American hands. 
f 
CRISIS ON THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is 
no surprise to anyone here or through-
out the United States that we have a 
serious crisis at our southern border. 
All anyone has to do is go visit the 
southern border to see the devastation, 
to see the death, to see the despera-
tion, to see the drugs coming across, 
Madam Speaker. 
Since President Biden has come into 
office, a record number, over 2 million 
illegal immigrants, have been appre-
hended: a 128 percent increase in appre-
hensions from the previous year. 
And 1.7 million migrants were appre-
hended illegally just this year, while 
400,000 illegally crossed the border and 
got away. 
But the President and his adminis-
tration halted the Trump administra-
tion’s successful remain in Mexico pol-
icy, has reinstated catch-and-release, 
has refused to enforce title 42, and is 
providing incentives for illegals to 
come into our country through mass 
amnesty proposals, work visas, and 
driver’s licenses. Okay? 
This is a serious matter for every 
State, for my constituents, for my dis-
trict. We have the highest level of over-
dose fatalities ever, and it is a direct 
result of the Biden administration pol-
icy. This needs to stop. This is a ter-
rible situation caused by the Biden ad-
ministration. I wish it would stop. We 
could stop it here.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF RALPH OWENS 
(Mr. CLYDE asked and was given per-

Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of an 
honorable public servant, Mr. Ralph 
Owens, of Lavonia, Georgia. 
As a lifetime member of the Franklin 
County community, Ralph humbly an-
swered the call to public service and 
played a critical role in the city of 
Lavonia’s success. In 1987, Mr. Owens 
was first elected to the Lavonia City 
Council. Just two short years later, he 
became the mayor of Lavonia, where 
he dutifully served his local commu-
nity for over three decades. 
During his lifetime as a public offi-
cial, Mayor Owens’ leadership ushered 
in impressive industrial and economic 
growth to the city. From dramatically 
improving the city’s police depart-
ment, to bringing new businesses to 
the community, Ralph was a dedicated 
servant to the great people of Lavonia. 
I am deeply saddened by the loss of 
such an accomplished individual that 
led with his servant’s heart to truly 
make a positive difference in his com-
munity. Georgia’s Ninth District will 
always remember Mayor Ralph Owens 
and his profound impact on the city of 
Lavonia and both Franklin and Hart 
Counties in northeast Georgia.

CONGRATULATING ELIZABETH 
RAFF 
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to rise today to congratulate 
Mrs. Elizabeth Raff of Lancaster Coun-
ty, who was recently named Pennsylva-
nia’s Teacher of the Year for 2022. 
Elizabeth teaches sixth grade at 
Pequea Elementary School, in the 
Penn Manor School District in Lan-
caster County, where she has taught 
since 2014. Penn Manor School District 
Superintendent, Dr. Mike Leichliter, 
described Elizabeth as a ‘‘dynamic and 
creative teacher who is always looking 
to find new ways to reach her stu-
dents’’ and noted that ‘‘she creates a 
space where students are encouraged to 
explore ideas in a supportive and re-
spectful environment.’’ 
There is no question that teachers 
and students have been impacted; they 
have had challenges presented by the 
COVID–19 pandemic over the last 2 
years, and we thank our teachers for 
all they have done to make sure that 
our students are receiving the best edu-
cation possible. 
That is certainly true of Mrs. Raff, 
whose classroom is well-decorated and 
offers students access to a large library 
of books to pique their interest, and a 
raised stage to provide students the op-
portunity to present to their class-
mates. 
Thank you to Mrs. Raff for all you 
have done to educate students in our 
community. We all appreciate your ef-
forts and wish to congratulate you on 
being 
named 
Pennsylvania’s 
2022 
Teacher of the Year.

affirmed, including in its July 9, 2020 holding 
in Trump v. Mazars, Congress’s ‘‘power of in-
quiry—with process to enforce it—is an es-
sential and appropriate auxiliary to the leg-
islative function’’. Congress’s power to ob-
tain information, including through the 
issuance of subpoenas and the enforcement 
of such subpoenas, is ‘‘broad and indispen-
sable’’. 
(2) Congress ‘‘suffers a concrete and par-
ticularized injury when denied the oppor-
tunity to obtain information necessary’’ to 
the exercise of its constitutional functions, 
as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District 
of Columbia Circuit correctly recognized in 
its August 7, 2020 en banc decision in Com-
mittee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of 
Representatives v. McGahn. 
(3) Accordingly, the Constitution secures 
to each House of Congress an inherent right 
to enforce its subpoenas in court. Explicit 
statutory authorization is not required to se-
cure such a right of action, and the contrary 
holding by a divided panel of the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Cir-
cuit in McGahn, entered on August 31, 2020, 
was in error. 
SEC. 403. ENFORCEMENT OF CONGRESSIONAL 
SUBPOENAS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 85 of title 28, 
United States Code, is amended by inserting 
after section 1365 the following:

poena recipients 
‘‘(a) CAUSE OF ACTION.—The United States 
House of Representatives, the United States 
Senate, or a committee or subcommittee 
thereof, may bring a civil action against the 
recipient of a subpoena issued by a congres-
sional committee or subcommittee to en-
force compliance with the subpoena. 
‘‘(b) SPECIAL RULES.—In any civil action 
described in subsection (a), the following 
rules shall apply: 
‘‘(1) The action may be filed in a United 
States district court of competent jurisdic-
tion. 
‘‘(2) Notwithstanding section 1657(a), it 
shall be the duty of every court of the United 
States to expedite to the greatest possible 
extent the disposition of any such action and 
appeal. Upon a showing by the plaintiff of 
undue delay, other irreparable harm, or good 
cause, a court to which an appeal of the ac-
tion may be taken shall issue any necessary 
and appropriate writs and orders to ensure 
compliance with this paragraph. 
‘‘(3) If a three-judge court is expressly re-
quested by the plaintiff in the initial plead-
ing, the action shall be heard by a three- 
judge court convened pursuant to section 
2284, and shall be reviewable only by appeal 
directly to the Supreme Court of the United 
States. Such appeal shall be taken by the fil-
ing of a notice of appeal within 10 days, and 
the filing of a jurisdictional statement with-
in 30 days, of the entry of the final decision. 
‘‘(4) The initial pleading must be accom-
panied by certification that the party bring-
ing the action has in good faith conferred or 
attempted to confer with the recipient of the 
subpoena to secure compliance with the sub-
poena without court action. 
‘‘(c) PENALTIES.—

‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The court may impose 
monetary penalties directly against each 
head of a Government agency and the head 
of each component thereof held to have 
knowingly failed to comply with any part of 
a congressional subpoena, unless— 
‘‘(i) the President instructed the official 
not to comply; and 
‘‘(ii) the President, or the head of the agen-
cy or component thereof, submits to the

and the basis for such instruction. 
‘‘(B) PROHIBITION

USE
OF
GOVERNMENT 
FUNDS.—No appropriated funds, funds pro-
vided from any accounts in the Treasury, 
funds derived from the collection of fees, or 
other Government funds shall be used to pay 
any monetary penalty imposed by the court 
pursuant to this paragraph. 
‘‘(2) LEGAL FEES.—In addition to any other 
penalties or sanctions, the court shall re-
quire that any defendant, other than a Gov-
ernment agency, held to have willfully failed 
to comply with any part of a congressional 
subpoena, pay a penalty in an amount equal 
to that party’s legal fees, including attor-
ney’s fees, litigation expenses, and other 
costs. If such defendant is an officer or em-
ployee of a Government agency, such fees 
may be paid from funds appropriated to pay 
the salary of the defendant. 
‘‘(d) WAIVER.—Any ground for noncompli-
ance asserted by the recipient of a congres-
sional subpoena shall be deemed to have been 
waived as to any particular information 
withheld from production if the court finds 
that the recipient failed in a timely manner 
to comply with the applicable requirements 
of section 105(b) of the Revised Statutes of 
the United States with respect to such infor-
mation. 
‘‘(e) RULES OF PROCEDURE.—The Supreme 
Court and the Judicial Conference of the 
United States shall prescribe rules of proce-
dure to ensure the expeditious treatment of 
actions described in subsection (a). Such 
rules shall be prescribed and submitted to 
the Congress pursuant to sections 2072, 2073, 
and 2074. This shall include procedures for 
expeditiously considering any assertion of 
constitutional or Federal statutory privilege 
made in connection with testimony by any 
recipient of a subpoena from a congressional 
committee or subcommittee. The Supreme 
Court shall transmit such rules to Congress 
within 6 months after the effective date of 
this section and then pursuant to section 
2074 thereafter. 
‘‘(f) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this sec-
tion, the term ‘Government agency’ means 
any office or entity described in section 105 
and 106 of title 3, an executive department 
listed in section 101 of title 5, an independent

eral Government, including wholly or partly

(ii) properly classified, including all proce-
dural and marking requirements, pursuant

the information was obtained; 
(E) the President, in his or her sole and

identifiable harm to an interest protected by 
an exception or the disclosure is prohibited 
by law; or 
(F) information in the opinion includes 
personnel and medical files and similar files 
the disclosure of which would constitute a 
clearly unwarranted invasion of personal pri-
vacy.

termination under this subsection to with-
hold information contained in a final OLC

the essence of the opinion, including any in-
terpretations of a statute, the Constitution, 
or other legal authority. A notation shall be 
included in any published list of final OLC 
opinions 
regarding 
the 
extent 
of 
the

is made, shall be indicated at the place in

a provision of this Act or an amendment 
made by this Act to any person or cir-
cumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, 
the remainder of this Act, and the applica-
tion of the provisions to any person or cir-
cumstance, shall not be affected by the hold-
ing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, is debatable for one hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form, or their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) and the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) 
each will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on H.R. 
5314, the Protecting Our Democracy 
Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 5314, the Pro-
tecting 
Our 
Democracy 
Act. 
This 
sweeping package of reforms would re-
store integrity, accountability, and 
transparency to our government. 
The landmark reforms in this bill 
would protect against future abuses, no 
matter who is President. This includes 
preventing abuses of the President’s 
pardon power and requiring the Presi-
dent and Vice President to disclose 
their tax returns. 
This bill includes many provisions 
that have bipartisan support. For ex-
ample, the bill includes a provision 
based on a bill previously introduced 
by Representative DARRELL
ISSA
to 
make it easier for Congress to enforce 
subpoenas. 
The bill would strengthen protec-
tions for inspectors general by only al-
lowing an IG to be removed for specific 
documented causes. This reform passed 
the House with a bipartisan vote in 
June as part of a bill I introduced to 
increase the independence of inspectors 
general, and it passed the House with 
overwhelming bipartisan support in 
2007. 
This bill also includes the bipartisan 
Whistleblower 
Protection 
Improve-
ment Act, which I was proud to intro-
duce. These provisions would strength-
en protections for whistleblowers who 
are retaliated against for reporting 
waste, fraud, and abuse. 
These reforms would provide whistle-
blowers the long overdue right to chal-
lenge retaliation in court. It would also 
prohibit agencies from launching retal-
iatory investigations and disclosing a 
whistleblower’s identity; and it would 
make clear that no Federal employee, 
including the President or Vice Presi-
dent of the United States, may inter-
fere with or retaliate against a whistle-
blower for sharing information with 
Congress. 
The Protecting Our Democracy Act 
would also protect the government 
from political interference by strength-
ening the Hatch Act. 
Just last month, the independent Of-
fice of Special Counsel found that 13 
senior Trump administration officials, 
including top White House aides and 
Cabinet members, broke the law by 
using their official government posi-
tion to campaign for President Trump. 
This legislation would also limit who 
can be named an acting official and for 
how 
long. 
I 
thank 
Representative 
KATIE PORTER for her leadership on 
these reforms which are included in her 
bill, the Accountability for Acting Offi-
cials Act. 
The reforms in this bill have broad 
support from over 150 groups, including 
the Brennan Center For Justice and 
the Project On Government Oversight. 
My colleagues from across the aisle 
continue to claim that this bill is 
about 
punishing 
former 
President 
Trump, but this is simply not true. 
While this bill addresses issues that 
were highlighted by past abuses, it is 
not about the past. It is about the fu-
ture of our democracy, and it will 
strengthen our democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge all 
of my colleagues, both Democrats and 
Republicans, to vote for the Protecting 
Our Democracy Act, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the bill the major-
ity has titled the Protecting Our De-
mocracy Act does nothing to protect 
anything but the swamp. 
Right now, the American people are 
trying to prepare for the holidays with 
the highest inflation rate in 30 years. 
They are struggling to keep their gas 
tanks full, put food on the table, and 
heat their homes. They are worried 
about rising crime in their commu-
nities. They are concerned their chil-
dren have suffered while their class-
rooms were closed but the borders are 
wide open to illegal immigrants and 
deadly drugs. 
Democrats are ignoring these real 
issues facing Americans today. Instead, 
Democrats want to talk about former 
President Trump, even though a Demo-
crat has occupied the White House for 
nearly a year. This is not what the 
American people want for Christmas. 
The Democrats’ playbook is about as 
predictable as a Hallmark Christmas 
special. We have all seen this movie. 
The bill before us today is based on 
political fiction, and it is the latest at-
tempt to resurrect Democrats’ sham 
investigations of the past. 
This bill unconstitutionally disrupts 
the separation of powers among the 
branches of government by diminishing 
the executive branch and ignoring the 
judicial branch. 
For example, the legislation inter-
feres 
with 
the 
President’s 
pardon 
power, a power completely vested with 
the President. But this bill gives Con-
gress access to sensitive White House 
deliberations 
and 
communications 
about pardons. What legislative pur-
pose does that serve? 
Congress has no authority to evalu-
ate the President’s pardon power. This 
bill also overrides the judicial branch 
by attaching partisan definitions to 
constitutional language that the Su-
preme Court has already spoken to. It 
would change the definition of an 
emolument to fit failed Democrat legal 
theories and indulge certain Members’ 
false 
conspiracy 
theories—Members 
like, I don’t know, Madam Speaker, 
ADAM SCHIFF. 
Rewriting this technical constitu-
tional term would keep any business-
person who has conducted business out-
side the U.S. from running for Presi-
dent. That would mean no Hunter 
Biden at the top of the ticket in 2024. 
Democrats appear to think the skill 
set for running a business would not be 
helpful to the Federal Government. 
Maybe that is why Democrats’ only so-
lution to any problem is to throw 
American taxpayer dollars at it and 
not to engage in serious government 
reform efforts. 
Democrats only want career politi-
cians—or even better, career bureau-
crats—to be able to serve as elected of-
ficials. Similarly, Democrats are deter-
mined to make the Federal Govern-
ment run as inefficiently as possible by 
allowing 
incompetent 
or 
dishonest 
Federal employees to keep their jobs. 
The so-called whistleblower protec-
tions in the bill are so expansive that if 
a Federal employee, even a bad or inef-
fective one, claims they are a whistle-
blower, they are almost immune from 
scrutiny. 
The Committee on Oversight and Re-
form has great respect for whistle-
blowers. We need them to conduct true 
oversight. They serve an essential role 
in evaluating waste, fraud, and abuse 
in the Federal Government. But some-
times Federal employees attempt to 
claim they are whistleblowers to shield 
themselves from scrutiny for poor per-
formance. We should not make it im-
possible to vet whistleblowers’ claims 
and their work. 
Further, the policy in the Democrats’ 
bill to entrench inspectors general is 
another policy that reduces the effi-
ciency of the Federal Government and 
another example of the legislative 
branch intruding on the operations of 
the executive branch. 
Madam Speaker, it is Christmastime. 
Instead of fixing the many problems 
created by President Biden, like the 
supply chain, energy, border, and eco-
nomic crises, Democrats have decided 
to take up a sham bill and deliver a 
lump of coal to the American people. 
Instead of spending time on Demo-
crats’ favorite obsession, 
President 
Trump, we should instead take on the 
issues facing Americans today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7583 
December 9, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), the distin-
guished chair of the Committee on Ap-
propriations. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship, alongside Chairman SCHIFF, on 
this very important legislation. 
Madam Speaker, the previous admin-
istration played fast and loose with the 
American people’s hard-earned tax dol-
lars. And just as seriously, it exposed 
dangerous faults in our democratic in-
stitutions that, if left unaddressed, will 
erode the American people’s trust in 
our democracy. 
That is why I am proud to be a co-
sponsor of the Protecting Our Democ-
racy Act, which restrains Presidents 
from abusing the public trust. 
Of particular importance to me as 
chair of the Appropriations Committee, 
this bill will ensure that every Presi-
dent, regardless of party, will be sub-
ject to the Congress’ constitutional 
power of the purse. 
It will strengthen congressional con-
trol and review over funding to ensure 
that Federal dollars are being used as 
directed by the Congress. 
It will require the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget to publish how it ap-
portions the appropriations provided 
by the Congress to executive agencies. 
Finally, the Protecting Our Democ-
racy Act will increase reporting to 
Congress on the executive branch’s 
compliance 
with 
the 
Impoundment 
Control Act and the Antideficiency 
Act, two bedrock laws that were en-
acted to protect Congress’ appropria-
tions power. 
The American people deserve a voice 
in how their money is spent. Through 
their duly elected Representatives in 
the Congress, the Protecting Our De-
mocracy Act gives the American peo-
ple that voice. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge sup-
port for this important piece of legisla-
tion. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. CRAWFORD). 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to op-
pose this insane piece of legislation 
House Democrats are proposing. 
This bill is yet another further at-
tempt by the chairman of the House 
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence, ADAM SCHIFF, to retroactively 
attack President Trump, even after the 
Democrats’ Russian collusion allega-
tions have been repeatedly debunked. 
I want to specifically bring attention 
to Title XIII of this ridiculous bill. 
This provision requires employees, offi-
cials, and agents of a Presidential cam-
paign to report foreign national con-
tact and/or contributions to the FEC 
and to the FBI. The FBI is then re-
quired to provide notice to the cam-
paign and to the House Permanent Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence, or 
HPSCI, as we call it. 
Sound familiar? The FBI would be re-
quired to work with HPSCI on counter-
intelligence investigations into polit-
ical candidates. What could possibly go 
wrong? 
This provision is designed to further 
the Democrat-led FBI scheme against 
Republican 
Presidential 
candidates, 
just as they did with President Trump. 
Here’s how it would work: First, if a 
foreign government contacts a Repub-
lican campaign, the Republican cam-
paign, in compliance with the proposed 
law, reports the contact to the FBI. 
Then the FBI notifies HPSCI Demo-
crats, and somehow the media miracu-
lously finds out about it and runs story 
after story about the Republican cam-
paign colluding with the foreign gov-
ernment. 
b 1245 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Lather, rinse, re-
peat. I am not sure if anyone has told 
Chairman SCHIFF and House Democrats 
yet, but Donald Trump is, unfortu-
nately, no longer President. Time to 
stop living in the past. 
The clear intent of this bill is to 
weaponize the Federal Government bu-
reaucracy 
against 
Republican 
can-
didates. If this legislation becomes law, 
Madam Speaker, don’t be surprised if 
we see Russian hoaxes every 2 years. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the gentleman from the great 
State of Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), the dis-
tinguished chair of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, this 
bill does not look back. 
Yes, we saw the abuses of Donald 
Trump over using the 1976 National 
Emergency Act in ways that it had 
never ever been used before to move 
money around to things because he 
couldn’t get it appropriated through a 
Republican Senate and a Republican 
House. He couldn’t get it done, so he 
moved the money around. 
Anybody who works in the House of 
Representatives or the Senate should 
be insulted that you want to empower 
a President—what about if Joe Biden 
starts doing that? Don’t you want to 
have these tools? Or any other future 
President of either party? 
This isn’t about Donald Trump. It is 
about the Trump era, which exposed 
things that need to be fixed, and this 
law does that. 
Subpoena 
power—our 
subpoenas 
should be enforceable, whether they 
are from a Democratic Congress or a 
Republican Congress. They are not. 
The Department of Justice needs to 
have a firewall between the White 
House and the Department of Justice. 
You can’t have the President calling up 
the Department of Justice, telling 
them to prosecute people or make stuff 
up. 
Any 
President 
of 
any 
party 
shouldn’t be able to do that. 
Then 
the 
President 
embargoed, 
stopped money that Congress, a Repub-
lican Congress, had sent for Ukraine. 
Just stopped it. But apparently, on the 
other side of the aisle, they feel like 
their job is to be handmaidens in case 
Trump comes back. 
They don’t want to put in the protec-
tions now when Joe Biden is there, who 
they carry on about as abusive all the 
time. Why not put in the protections 
now? Because you want Donald Trump 
to be able to come back and continue 
these sorts of abuses. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. STEWART). 
Mr. 
STEWART. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there is so much in this bill to be con-
cerned about. 
For the last 5 years, as a member of 
the House Intelligence Committee, I 
lived through the Russian hoax, I lived 
through 
impeachment 
1, 
I 
lived 
through impeachment 2, all of which 
are great examples of provisions in this 
bill that harm our democracy. Let me 
talk about just one of them. 
Tucked into this bill’s provisions are 
elements which will rewrite the very 
nature of our democracy, whittling 
down the meaning of government for 
the people and by the people. 
The President of the United States is 
elected by the people to run the execu-
tive branch. The President, by design, 
is accountable to the people. But 
among the many failures in this bill 
before us today are new sections which 
would severely restrict the ability of 
the President to remove senior govern-
ment employees. This will have the ef-
fect of empowering these senior offi-
cials with the ability to paralyze a 
President whose policies they may not 
agree with, which we saw again and 
again during the Russian hoax, during 
impeachment 1, and during impeach-
ment 2. This sets a dangerous prece-
dent that will create a permanent bu-
reaucratic resistance to the duly elect-
ed President. 
The danger of these provisions will 
also set in motion a precedent to 
weaponize the entire intelligence com-
munity bureaucracy by allowing anon-
ymous individuals to paralyze a Presi-
dent without any accountability. If 
you don’t think it is going to happen, I 
refer you back to the Russian inves-
tigation hoax, to impeachment 1, and 
to impeachment 2. This guarantees 
more of this collusion. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from the 
great State of California (Ms. LOF-
GREN), the distinguished chairwoman of 
the Committee on House Administra-
tion. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to highlight an important ele-
ment of reform that came out of work

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7584 
December 9, 2021 
a while ago from the House Adminis-
tration Committee. 
Most Americans believe that if a for-
eign adversary reaches out to interfere 
in our elections, the campaign ought to 
report that to law enforcement. In-
stead, as we saw in the previous admin-
istration, campaign officials welcomed 
and, in some cases, even solicited for-
eign assistance for political activities. 
This bill creates a duty to report illicit 
offers of campaign assistance from for-
eign governments to law enforcement. 
It also clarifies what is a thing of 
value. It includes information sought 
or obtained for political advantage, 
like opposition research. 
It ensures that individuals engaging 
in misconduct with foreign actors to 
influence our elections would be held 
accountable. It also ensures that for-
eign money cannot influence our poli-
tics through State and local ballot ini-
tiatives and referenda, closing a loop-
hole that recently was created by the 
FEC. 
Now, it is astounding to hear criti-
cism of the idea that the FBI should be 
notified when a foreign adversary is 
trying to corrupt our elections. We all 
know that that should happen. 
To distrust our law enforcement 
agencies when it comes to protecting 
our country from this kind of attack— 
which is what it is—from a foreign ad-
versary is shocking. Support this bill. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
H.R. 5314. 
Bringing H.R. 5314 to the House floor 
this week shows that the Democrats’ 
priority is partisan politics, not poli-
cies that will directly benefit the 
American people. 
If Democrats were serious about bi-
partisan reforms, they wouldn’t be 
pushing a bill like H.R. 5314. This bill is 
nothing but a continuation of the 
Democrats’ obsession with President 
Trump. He lives rent free in their 
heads. 
This bill incorporates several unnec-
essary ‘‘reforms’’ that are nothing but 
an attempt to validate House Demo-
crats’ baseless investigation of the 
Trump administration. 
It is a huge red flag that H.R. 5314 
was referred to nine committees and 
not one Democrat-led committee has 
held a hearing or a markup on the leg-
islation. 
This 
legislation 
is 
being 
pushed through without proper order, 
and I oppose it. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from the great 
State of California (Mr. SCHIFF), the 
distinguished chair of the Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Protecting Our De-
mocracy Act. I am very proud to spon-
sor this legislation, and I am grateful 
for the partnership of many chairs and 
Members who contributed to the effort, 
as well as the leadership of Speaker 
PELOSI. 
Our system was founded upon a re-
spect for the rule of law and a carefully 
constructed balance of power among 
the three branches. That system has, 
throughout history, been tested. Just 
as, after Watergate, Congress worked 
to pass reforms like campaign finance 
laws and new ethics rules, so we must 
now examine the cracks in the demo-
cratic foundation and address them. 
That is precisely what this bill does. 
It will prevent Presidential abuses of 
power, ensure the independence of our 
justice system, and reinforce the sys-
tem of checks and balances. 
Specifically, among other things, it 
would prevent corruption or misuse of 
the pardon power. It would ensure that 
Congress may exercise its constitu-
tionally mandated oversight respon-
sibilities and enforce subpoenas in a 
timely manner. It protects whistle-
blowers and expands the independence 
of inspectors general. It reestablishes 
Congress’ power of the purse. 
This bill has garnered support from 
groups across the political spectrum 
because it is not about politics; it is 
about the survival of our democratic 
system of government. Many of the re-
forms included in this package are 
sponsored and supported by Repub-
licans as well as Democrats. 
I urge all of my colleagues in Con-
gress to support the Protecting Our De-
mocracy Act. The day that we were 
sworn into office, we made a sacred 
pledge of allegiance and loyalty to the 
United States. This bill places our oath 
to democracy and the Constitution 
above party politics. This is a moment 
and a vote when we have the oppor-
tunity to fulfill that oath. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I was 
hoping the chairman of the Intel-
ligence 
Committee 
was 
going 
to 
present the evidence of Russian collu-
sion during his time, but apparently 
not. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZGERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5314. 
The bill is simply another political at-
tack by the Democrats on President 
Trump. It also destroys the separation 
of powers between the President and 
Congress. 
I introduced an amendment to the 
bill to require Congress to be notified 
when the AG terminates a special 
counsel, but unfortunately, the Rules 
Committee failed to adopt it. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle spent the last several years 
peddling bogus allegations that Presi-
dent Trump colluded with Russia. Now 
the Durham investigation has proved 
these allegations were a sham that 
wasted years of time and resources, 
and now we know the Clinton cam-
paign paid Fusion GPS to draft the 
dossier as opposition research. 
Fusion GPS relied on information 
from Igor Danchenko, a Russian who 
worked at the Brookings Institution. 
Mr. Danchenko based his information 
on tales from Chuck Dolan, a public re-
lations executive who worked for the 
Hillary Clinton campaign in the past. 
The whole scheme was a vicious circle 
that began and ended with the Clinton 
campaign. 
We cannot have a bill that works to 
prevent overreach by one branch of 
government. I urge my colleagues to 
oppose the bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the gentleman from the great 
Commonwealth of Kentucky (Mr. YAR-
MUTH), the distinguished chairman of 
the Committee on the Budget. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, de-
mocracy is not static. It is not self-ef-
fectuating. It requires a concerted ef-
fort to keep and a willingness to stand 
up against those who would seek to un-
dermine it. 
The bill before us reaffirms our com-
mitment to democracy, transparency, 
accountability, and a strong system of 
checks and balances. 
Our Founders knew that the power of 
the purse would be fundamental to the 
separation of powers and to our demo-
cratic government itself, and they ex-
plicitly gave that power to Congress, 
the branch most responsive to the will 
of the people. 
However, over the past few decades, 
the executive branch has encroached 
on our constitutional spending author-
ity, and dangerous precedents have 
been set. Presidents and agencies of 
both parties have pushed the bound-
aries, seeking more control of spending 
powers. The previous administration’s 
disregard for the rule of law and con-
tempt for institutional norms made 
even more clear the need for laws that 
can withstand a lawless executive. 
The commonsense reforms in this 
landmark legislation will restore Con-
gress’ central role in funding decisions, 
increase executive transparency, and 
add teeth to our budget laws. None of 
these provisions or the many others in 
this legislation is partisan. After all, 
this bill was introduced during the 
Trump administration, and it is being 
advanced during the Biden administra-
tion. It is solely about shoring up the 
separation of powers and maintaining 
the rule of law. 
Therefore, I encourage my colleagues 
on both sides to uphold our sworn duty 
to defend the Constitution and vote 
‘‘yes’’ on the Protecting Our Democ-
racy Act. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
setting aside the Democrats’ neurotic 
obsession 
with 
all 
things 
Donald 
Trump, this measure has many provi-
sions that would receive bipartisan 
support if the bill’s author were so in-
clined. 
But when we speak of protecting de-
mocracy, we need to remember what 
democracy is. It is the process by 
which the sovereign people, through

elections, decide who will control and 
direct the powers that we entrust to 
our government. 
‘‘The executive power shall be vested 
in a President of the United States of 
America.’’ If the executive branch be-
gins to operate independently of the 
President, the will of the people is 
thwarted and democracy is diminished. 
For example, the Tenure of Office 
Act limited the President’s authority 
to remove Cabinet officers, a dangerous 
concept ultimately repealed by the 
Congress and repudiated by the Su-
preme Court. Provisions in this bill, 
such as those that interfere with Presi-
dential appointments, cross that very 
bright constitutional line. 
b 1300 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. NADLER), the distinguished chair-
man of the Committee on the Judici-
ary. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the Protecting Our 
Democracy Act. 
Transparency and accountability are 
the bedrock of our democratic system. 
They are the essential guardrails that 
protect against unchecked executive 
power. Unfortunately, the Trump ad-
ministration exposed certain vulnera-
bilities in the fabric of our democracy 
by engaging in conduct that was once 
unthinkable, and like the reforms en-
acted post-Watergate, we must now act 
to prevent similar abuses from a future 
President. 
Although many of these provisions 
were informed by our experience with 
the prior administration, they are 
pointedly not anti-Trump measures. 
Rather, they are forward looking, and 
they protect against the abuses by fu-
ture Presidents of any party. Impor-
tantly, many of them are also based on 
proposals that have bipartisan support. 
I am especially proud of the provi-
sions in this bill that fall within the 
Judiciary Committee’s jurisdiction. 
These include requiring an expedited, 
streamlined process for enforcing Con-
gressional subpoenas in court. This 
would prevent an administration from 
stonewalling Congressional oversight 
and then evading accountability for 
years while the courts resolve the 
issue. 
To address abuses of the clemency 
power, the bill requires additional 
transparency, and it reaffirms that 
abuses of the clemency power can form 
the basis of a bribery scheme and that 
self-pardons are prohibited. 
It pauses the statute of limitations 
on Federal offenses during a President 
and Vice President’s term in office to 
ensure that they can be held account-
able for criminal conduct just like any 
other American. 
And it addresses improper commu-
nications between the White House and 
the Department of Justice, an all too 
common occurrence under the last ad-
ministration. 
Madam Speaker, when the Nation’s 
Founders wrote the Constitution, after 
having just fought a war against a ty-
rant, they stood fast to a key principle, 
that the executive must not be a king 
and must instead be accountable to 
Congress, to the people, and ulti-
mately, to the rule of law. It is vital 
that we reassert this important prin-
ciple. 
The Protecting Our Democracy Act 
would restore these and other checks 
and balances that are so fundamental 
to our democracy. 
I urge all Members to support this 
vital legislation. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), the ranking 
member of the House Administration 
Committee. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my good 
friend, the gentleman from Kentucky, 
for yielding. The bill we are debating 
here today, the so-called Protecting 
Our Democracy Act, is another at-
tempt by the outgoing majority to re-
litigate many of the Democrats’ sham 
investigations. Many of the bill’s provi-
sions are unnecessary and recycled at-
tempts to take away individual States’ 
sovereignty. If we were really here to 
talk about protecting our democracy, 
then we would focus on the importance 
of voter rolls list maintenance to en-
sure only eligible citizens are able to 
vote in Federal elections. 
Congress passed the bipartisan Na-
tional Voter Registration Act in 1993. 
That is almost 30 years ago. This law 
requires States to conduct regular list 
maintenance to ensure their voter rolls 
are kept up to date. This simple, com-
monsense requirement is incredibly 
important for voter confidence in our 
entire election process and its out-
comes. 
However, the Biden DOJ refuses to 
enforce it. Instead, Progressives focus 
on defunding the police and embracing 
lawlessness, keeping our economy and 
Capitol shut down while ignoring the 
science, labeling concerned parents as 
extremist threats, and weaponizing the 
DOJ to go after them, and pursuing 
reckless, unnecessary spending that is 
driving 
the 
inflation 
every 
single 
American feels in their pocketbook. 
If Democrats were really focused on 
protecting our democracy, the Biden 
Justice Department would investigate 
States like California where the num-
ber of registered voters far exceeds the 
number of adults in the State. Senator 
ALEX PADILLA, a newly appointed Sen-
ator from the State of California, knew 
about the problem and refused to ad-
dress it when he was Secretary of State 
in California during the last election 
cycle. 
Republicans care about election in-
tegrity because our constitutional re-
public means nothing if our citizens 
don’t have faith in our elections. 
When everyday Americans hear more 
and more reports of individuals on ac-
tive voter rolls who have moved to an-
other State, died, or are noncitizens, it 
frustrates them because it calls into 
question whether their valid vote actu-
ally counts. One eligible person, one 
whole non-diluted vote. 
It is so frustrating because the fix is 
so simple, but Democrats refuse time 
and time again to address this problem. 
It is common sense and has been Fed-
eral law for decades that only eligible 
Americans should be on our voter rolls. 
Republicans 
want 
every 
eligible 
voter who wants to vote to exercise 
that right. Democrats dilute your vote, 
but Republicans restore it. 
I am here today to talk about pro-
tecting our democracy, and I think the 
only way to do that is to make sure 
Americans know our elections have in-
tegrity. 
So today, I am calling on the radical 
Biden Justice Department to do the 
right thing and enforce Federal law 
across the board. Stop investigating 
parents that want to be involved in 
their children’s education. Stop sup-
porting efforts to defund our men and 
women in blue resulting in the lawless-
ness that we see ravaging our great 
country. 
Focus on what really matters. Pro-
tect our democracy, protect our vote, 
and ensure States like California con-
duct voter roll list maintenance so 
that voters know only eligible Amer-
ican citizens are able to vote. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a report from the Department 
of Justice IG detailing the DOJ’s offi-
cial policy not to enforce Federal voter 
list maintenance requirements.

of the Inspector General, March 2013] 
A REVIEW OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE VOTING 
SECTION OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION 
V. ENFORCEMENT OF THE NATIONAL VOTER 
REGISTRATION ACT (NVRA) 
In this section we review the Voting Sec-
tion’s history of enforcing the National 
Voter Registration Act, the so-called motor- 
voter law. Enacted in 1993, the NVRA has. 
two primary purposes: to increase the num-
ber of eligible citizens who register to vote 
in federal elections and to protect the integ-
rity of the electoral process. 42 U.S.C. 
1973gg(b). Critics have alleged that CRT lead-
ership during the prior administration fa-
vored enforcement of the list-maintenance 
(electoral integrity) provisions because those 
provisions purportedly are more strongly 
supported by Republicans and remove more 
potential Democratic voters from the rolls. 
Conversely, critics of the current CRT lead-
ership allege that it has neglected the elec-
toral integrity provisions of the NVRA in 
favor of enforcing the voter access provi-
sions, because these provisions purportedly 
are supported by Democratic constituencies 
and lead to the registration of more voters 
who are likely to support Democrats. With-
out opining on the underlying political as-
sumptions, we examine both of these allega-
tions in this section. 
A. DATA REGARDING ENFORCEMENT TRENDS IN 
NVRA CASES 
Figure 3. 7 below displays the number of 
NVRA enforcement actions initiated by the 
Voting Section on an annual basis since Jan-
uary 1995, when the statute became effective 
in most states. Figure 3. 7 is broken down by 
actions that enforced the statute’s list-main-
tenance provision (Section 8(a)(4)), actions

that enforced the voter registration provi-
sions (Sections 5, 6, 7, and the improper purg-
ing paragraphs of Section 8), and actions 
that brought both types of claims. 
The most noteworthy trend in the Depart-
ment’s enforcement of the NVRA relates to 
the statute’s voter list-maintenance provi-
sion, Section 8(a)(4). In the 17 years since the 
statute became effective, the Department 
has asserted list-maintenance claims on 7 oc-
casions, 6 of which occurred in a 3-year span 
between 2004 and 2007. According to Hans von 
Spakovsky, CRT leadership initiated an ef-
fort to enforce Section 8’s list-maintenance 
provision in late 2004. Von Spakovsky told 
the OIG that he recommended to Division 
leadership exploring those cases because he 
believed that the Department had never con-
ducted a systematic review of states’ list- 
maintenance compliance in the 10 years 
since the NVRA became effective. This effort 
ultimately resulted in the filing of a com-
plaint alleging list-maintenance claims in 
2005 and 2006. According to witnesses in-
volved in the four other matters involving 
list-maintenance claims brought between 
2004 and 2007, those claims arose when the 
Section obtained evidence suggesting a fail-
ure to comply with the list-maintenance pro-
vision during the course of ongoing inves-
tigations into other voting-related matters. 
B. ENFORCEMENT OF THE NVRA DURING 2001–2008 
We received allegations that the only 
NVRA cases that Division leadership wanted 
to pursue during this period were Section 
8(a)(4) list-maintenance claims, at the ex-
pense of cases to protect or increase voter 
registration under other provisions of the 
NVRA. Critics further alleged that the Divi-
sion’s leadership was particularly focused on 
bringing such list-purging cases in political 
swing states and large Democratic jurisdic-
tions. The Division’s leadership denied any 
such focus and identified several cases ap-
proved by Division leadership to controvert 
the suggestion that NVRA enforcement deci-
sions were driven by a partisan agenda. We 
examined the entire range of NVRA cases 
pursued during January 2001 to January 2009 
in order to address this issue. 
From January 2001 through January 2009, 
the Department was involved in 12 NVRA en-
forcement matters, summarized in Table 3.2. 
As reflected in Table 3.2, the Voting Sec-
tion began filing list-maintenance cases in 
2004. As noted above, von Spakovsky con-
firmed that Division leadership initiated an 
effort in 2004 to enforce Section 8’s list-main-
tenance provision on a systemic basis. Von 
Spakovsky told the OIG that he rec-
ommended exploring those cases because he 
believed the Department had never con-
ducted a systematic review of states’ list- 
maintenance compliance in the 10 years 
since the NVRA’s enactment. 
Division leadership directed the Voting 
Section to conduct the research effort, to re-
view the census data and voter registration 
data for all 50 states to determine which 
states had more people registered to vote 
than the voting-age population, as reflected 
in the census data. Based on the results of 
this research, the Section sent letters to 12 
states, stating that the Section’s review of 
relevant data indicated that the state may 
not be complying with Section 8’s list-main-
tenance provision and requesting informa-
tion on their efforts to remove ineligible vot-
ers from their registration lists. 
Von Spakovsky told the OIG that some of 
the targeted states responded to the Depart-
ment’s letter, explained why there was a dis-
crepancy in the data, and established that 
they were complying with the NVRA’s list- 
maintenance requirements. He also stated 
that a number of states failed to show that 
they were in compliance with Section 8(a)(4) 
and that the Section proceeded toward en-
forcement actions against those non-compli-
ant states. 
Division leadership approved the filing of 
two complaints as a result of this enforce-
ment initiative. In November 2005, the Sec-
tion filed a lawsuit against the state of Mis-
souri alleging both improper purging and 
failure-to-purge violations. In June 2006, the 
Section filed a complaint against Indiana al-
leging that the state failed to conduct list 
purging as required by Section 8(a)(4). The 
Indiana case was resolved by a settlement 
agreement, but the Missouri case continued 
until early 2009, when the Division volun-
tarily dismissed the case. 
In 2006 and 2007, Division leadership ap-
proved three additional complaints con-
taining 
Section 
8(a)(4) 
list-maintenance 
claims, against the States of Maine and New 
Jersey and the City of Philadelphia. Accord-
ing to the Voting Section attorney super-
vising those efforts, these complaints did not 
arise out of the enforcement initiative de-
scribed above. Instead, the complaints were 
brought as a result of investigations under 
the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) that un-
covered evidence of both HAVA and NVRA 
violations. The Section ultimately settled 
the lawsuits with Maine, New Jersey, and 
Philadelphia. In each settlement agreement, 
the jurisdiction agreed to implement specific 
steps to satisfy its list-maintenance obliga-
tions. 
In August 2007, Voting Section Chief John 
Tanner initiated a program to enforce Sec-
tion 7 of the NVRA, requiring states to pro-
vide voter registration opportunities in pub-
lic assistance and disability offices. Section 
attorneys reviewed federal Election Assist-
ance Commission (EAC) data to identify 
states that were not meeting Section 7’s re-
quirements and discovered 18 states that re-
ported registering 0 voters in offices pro-
viding public assistance over the previous 2- 
year period. Following further investigation, 
the Section entered into settlement agree-
ments with Arizona and Illinois to resolve 
Section 7 violations. 
In 2007 and 2008, Voting Section teams re-
viewed EAC data and census information to 
identify states that might not be in compli-
ance with the NVRA’sSection 8(a)(4) list- 
maintenance requirements. The teams iden-
tified states in which a significant percent-
age of the counties or electoral jurisdictions 
had more registered voters than voting-age 
population. The teams recommended to Divi-
sion leadership that the Voting Section ini-
tiate investigations into the states that 
failed to meet the relevant criterion. The 
states that were the subject of these rec-
ommendations included some states that his-
torically have consistently favored one party 
in presidential elections as well as political 
‘‘swing states.’’ The 2007 recommendation 
was approved and the Section later issued re-
quests for information to the relevant states. 
Ultimately, however, no further enforcement 
action was taken arising out of this effort. 
The investigations that were proposed in 
late November 2008 were never approved by 
either the outgoing or the incoming adminis-
trations. 
C. ENFORCEMENT OF THE NVRA DURING 2009–2012 
1. Division Leadership Declines To Act on 
Voting Section Proposal for Section 8 In-
vestigation 
In February 2009, shortly after the new ad-
ministration took office, the Voting Section 
submitted a memorandum to Division lead-
ership requesting approval to initiate inves-
tigations into the list-maintenance proce-
dures of a State (‘‘State E’’). According to 
the State E memorandum, voter-registration 
data indicated that roughly 22 percent of 
State E’s counties had more registered vot-
ers than either the voting-age population or 
the 
citizen 
voting-age 
population. 
The 
memorandum stated that the Section had 
been alerted to State E’s potential list-main-
tenance failures in connection with an unre-
lated Section 5 investigation. We were told 
that the Section never received a response 
from Division leadership to the proposal 
memorandum. 
2. Drafting of NVRA Guidance 
In the spring of 2009, a few months after 
the inauguration of the new administration, 
the Department commenced an effort to 
draft public guidance concerning the require-
ments of NVRA Section 7. Samuel Hirsch, 
who joined the Department in March 2009 as 
a Deputy Associate Attorney General and led 
the NVRA guidance effort, described the 
project as rewriting the NVRA in plain 
terms and posting it on the CRT website to 
assist those running state governmental of-
fices in complying with the NVRA’s require-
ments. Hirsch told the OIG the original 
scope of the NVRA guidance project was lim-
ited to Section 7 because the administration 
believed that Section 7 had been somewhat 
ignored by state government officials. Ac-
cording to Hirsch, there was a sense in the 
administration that NVRA Section 8 and 
other provisions were working fairly well, 
but that Section 7 ‘‘was slipping through the 
cracks.’’ 
DAAG Julie Fernandes and AAG Thomas 
Perez became involved in the NVRA guid-
ance project after they joined the Depart-
ment in July and October 2009, respectively. 
According to Fernandes, she expressed con-
cern to Hirsch that the project was limited 
to Section 7 and proposed broadening the 
guidance to include other NVRA provisions, 
such as Sections 5 and 8. Perez also told the 
OIG that in early 2010 he instructed that the 
guidance include a discussion of all NVRA 
provisions, including the list-maintenance 
provisions. Hirsch told the OIG that he did 
not oppose expanding the guidance to in-
clude Section 8, but stated that he may have 
been opposed to holding up the release of the 
Section 7 guidance while preparing the Sec-
tion 8 segment. The Division ultimately 
posted guidance concerning NVRA Sections 
5, 6, 7, and 8 on its website in June 2010. 
3. Comments by DAAG Julie Fernandes Re-
garding NVRA Enforcement at a Novem-
ber 2009 Section Meeting 
DAAG Julie Fernandes told the OIG that 
she urged Voting Section Chief Christopher 
Coates to hold section-wide meetings shortly 
after she joined the Department in July 2009. 
As a result, the Voting Section held several 
brown-bag lunches. In addition to the Sep-
tember meeting at which Section 2 enforce-
ment was discussed as outlined above, an-
other session devoted to NVRA matters was 
held on November 10, 2009. 
At some point during the November meet-
ing, the discussion turned to the enforce-
ment of the NVRA’s voter list-maintenance 
provision in Section 8. Witnesses who re-
called Fernandes’s statements uniformly re-
membered that she said something to the ef-
fect that she was more interested in pur-
suing cases under NVRA Section 7 than Sec-
tion 8 because Section 8 does not expand 
voter access. Witnesses’ recollections of the 
context of Fernandes’s statements, her pre-
cise wording, and the meaning of her com-
ments, however, varied widely. 
Thirteen witnesses told the OIG that 
Fernandes stated that she ‘‘did not care 
about’’ or ‘‘was not interested’’ in pursuing 
Section 8 cases, or similar formulations. For 
instance, Chris Herren, who was later pro-
moted by current Division leadership to Sec-
tion Chief, told the OIG that Fernandes 
made a controversial and ‘‘very provocative’’ 
statement at this brown bag lunch. In par-
ticular, Herren stated that Fernandes stated

something to the effect of ‘‘[Section 8] does 
nothing to help voters. We have no interest 
in that.’’ Herren told the OIG that he winced 
when he heard Fernandes’s response because 
he believed it would raise a controversy. Two 
other Section attorneys took handwritten 
notes at the meeting, both of which quoted 
Fernandes saying that she did not ‘‘care’’ 
about Section 8. 
Ten attorneys who attended the meeting 
told 
the 
OIG 
that 
they 
interpreted 
Fernandes’s comments to be a clear directive 
that Division leadership would not approve 
Section 8 list-maintenance cases in the fu-
ture. One Section attorney told the OIG that 
he understood Fernandes’s statements to 
mean that proposing a Section 8 case would 
be futile and that he believed proposing Sec-
tion 8 could be detrimental for the attor-
neys. 
Seven Voting Section attorneys told the 
OIG, however, that they did not believe 
Fernandes said that the Division would not 
enforce Section 8 of the NVRA. Among these 
were three Deputy Chiefs who told the OIG 
that they believed Fernandes meant that 
Section 7 cases would be prioritized over 
Section 8 matters, but that they did not con-
strue her statement to mean that Section 8 
cases would not be approved. Those attor-
neys who were generally identified as being 
more conservative tended to recall that 
Fernandes took the more extreme position, 
while those generally identified as being 
more liberal tended to recall her statements 
as being more limited. 
Fernandes told the OIG that she did not re-
call exactly what she said at the November 
brown bag lunch regarding enforcement of 
Section 8 of the NVRA. She said that she and 
the Section staff discussed the NVRA and 
what their approach, goals, and strategy 
should be. She said that she talked about 
how Division leadership is interested in cre-
ating equal opportunity for minority voters. 
Fernandes further told the OIG that she 
talked about wanting the Section to focus on 
voter access, which would involve NVRA 
Sections 5, 7, and 8, all of which are in the 
vein of ensuring that jurisdictions have a 
fair and accessible process for all voters. She 
stated that she recalled being asked about 
Section 8 and that her response included 
something to the effect that Division leader-
ship’s focus is on the provisions of the NVRA 
pertaining to voter access. 
With respect to the comments attributed 
to her that she did not care about enforcing 
Section 8, Fernandes told the OIG that she 
did not think she said the words ‘‘don’t care’’ 
about enforcing Section 8 because that is not 
her position. Fernandes denied saying that 
she or Division leadership had no interest in 
pursuing Section 8 cases. Fernandes said 
that she believed her comment about not 
caring was in the context of how to deter-
mine what jurisdictions they should target 
for enforcement, given that she believed 
there is widespread noncompliance with the 
NVRA. 
Fernandes noted that the list-maintenance 
provision of Section 8 requires jurisdictions 
to employ reasonable, non-discriminatory 
measures to ensure that people who are eligi-
ble can vote and those who are ineligible 
cannot. Therefore, Fernandes stated, she 
does not care whether a jurisdiction’s voter 
list is big, but rather whether it has a list- 
maintenance program that does not work. 
She explained that the fact that a jurisdic-
tion’s voter list is too big means that the 
Section may want to inquire about the juris-
diction’s list-maintenance program, but that 
alone would not justify bringing a lawsuit. 
Roughly one year later, in September 2010, 
allegations 
concerning 
Fernandes’s 
com-
ments at the brown bag lunch regarding 
NVRA enforcement surfaced in news media. 
Fernandes and other Division leadership per-
sonnel assisted other Department officials in 
preparing talking points to address the alle-
gations and Fernandes stated in one of the 
relevant e-mails: ‘‘If we are o.k. with having 
priorities, we should say that we have a pri-
ority on the enforcement of the NVRA, with 
a focus on the parts of the statute that re-
quire states to provide voter registration op-
portunities in a variety of settings.’’ 
4. Approval of List-Maintenance Investiga-
tions 
In September 2009, the Section submitted a 
memorandum to DAAG Fernandes request-
ing authority to initiate formal investiga-
tions into the list-maintenance procedures of 
eight states. The recommendation was based 
on the Section’s review of an EAC report 
that contained voting-related data from each 
of the 50 states covering the period from No-
vember 2006 to November 2008. A Deputy Sec-
tion Chief supervised a team of Section at-
torneys that reviewed the EAC report for 
anomalous entries, particularly states that 
reported that throughout the 2–year period 
they did not remove any voters from their 
rolls due to death or that they had not issued 
any voter-removal notices related to citizens 
who were believed to have moved out of the 
state. The team identified eight states that 
met one of those criteria, four of which re-
ported removing zero ineligible voters from 
their rolls over the 2–year period for any rea-
son, including death, change of address, dis-
qualifying criminal conviction, or mental in-
capacity. 
The team presented the relevant data in 
its memorandum to DAAG Fernandes and 
stated that the information suggested that 
the eight states in question were not ful-
filling their list-maintenance obligations 
under Section 8. As a result, the team rec-
ommended initiating formal investigations 
of the states in question and directing in-
quiries to relevant state officials. 
Fernandes told the OIG that, after receiv-
ing the proposal for the Section 8 investiga-
tions, she told Section Chief Coates that he 
needed to ‘‘hold off’ because she was not 
ready to decide whether this was the proper 
approach for NVRA enforcement. Fernandes 
told the OIG that she believed the Section’s 
NVRA work when she became DAAG in July 
2009 was disorganized and that its process for 
evaluating NVRA matters was ‘‘random, 
unstrategic, [and] not very well thought- 
out.’’ She said that Division leadership and 
Voting Section management were therefore 
engaged in a process of identifying what 
their NVRA enforcement strategy should be 
by reviewing where the Section had focused 
its enforcement efforts in the past, deter-
mining which areas had been neglected, and 
developing an analytical model to bring 
NVRA cases. 
According to Fernandes, she and Division 
leadership believed that the NVRA enforce-
ment efforts from January 2001 through Jan-
uary 2009 had focused on Section 8’s list- 
maintenance cases, largely to the exclusion 
of the voter-registration provisions in Sec-
tion 7, which she believed had been under-
enforced and neglected. While we found no 
evidence that she examined any data to sup-
port this belief, it was consistent with what 
we found to be the prevailing belief about 
the prior administration’s efforts in this 
area. Fernandes stated further that she be-
lieved the way to ‘‘rectify this imbalance 
was to determine what Section 7 efforts were 
in process, whether they were being per-
formed correctly, and whether the Section 
should expand its Section 7 enforcement fur-
ther. Fernandes stated that her supervisors 
were pressuring her to move forward on Sec-
tion 7 enforcement and that she received a 
clear message that they viewed enforcing 
Section 7 as a higher priority than Section 8. 
She told the OIG that she believed she had to 
‘‘scratch the Section 7 itch before turning to 
Section 8 matters and that her supervisors 
would have criticized her if she had approved 
Section 8 efforts first. She also noted that 
there was significant criticism of the Depart-
ment from civil rights groups that their Sec-
tion 7 enforcement efforts had been inad-
equate, saying they had gotten—and contin-
ued to get—‘‘beat up all the time by [their] 
lefty friends not doing enough on Section 7.’’ 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. This 
is a report from the DOJ’s IG. It takes 
this many pages to tell the American 
voter that they are not going to en-
force Federal law in ensuring that 
States actually provide and exercise 
the required voter list maintenance. 
This is an affront to election integrity 
in our great country, and it needs to 
end today. 
Let’s protect our democracy, and 
let’s work together to make that hap-
pen.

OCTOBER 6, 2021. 
OVER 150 ORGANIZATIONS SEND JOINT LETTER 
URGING CONGRESS TO PASS THE PROTECTING 
OUR DEMOCRACY ACT 
DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: The under-
signed organizations, on behalf of the mil-
lions of Americans our groups collectively 
represent, write to urge you to support and 
pass the Protecting Our Democracy Act. 
For decades, congressional authority has 
been undermined by the executive branch, 
diminishing the ability of Congress to fulfill 
its constitutional duties, to protect the rule 
of law, and to hold all presidents accountable 
for overreaches and abuses of power. The last 
time Congress passed significant reform to 
protect our democracy from abuses of execu-
tive power was after the Watergate scandal. 
The time has come for new guardrails to re-
assert Congress’ role as a coequal branch of 
government. 
Today, lawmakers on both sides of the 
aisle and in both chambers have an interest 
in restoring the checks and balances en-
trusted to them in our Constitution. The 
Protecting Our Democracy Act would do just 
that by restoring the powers the Founders 
vested in the legislative branch to serve as a 
check on the executive without infringing 
upon the president’s constitutional powers. 
Among other reforms, this historic bill 
would: 
Strengthen Congress’s ability to oversee 
the executive branch by fortifying congres-
sional subpoena power by providing expe-
dited consideration of subpoena enforcement 
by courts, so the executive branch cannot 
run out the clock on congressional oversight; 
Ensure inspectors general are qualified and 
empowered to hold federal agencies account-
able without fear of reprisal by requiring the

president to have ‘‘good cause’’ for removing 
an inspector general and enhancing report-
ing requirements when there is a vacancy; 
Ensure whistleblowers can continue shin-
ing light on corruption and abuses of power 
that betray the public trust by enhancing 
protections against retaliation, providing 
legal defenses for whistleblowers against 
civil and criminal liability, and allowing 
whistleblowers to have their day in court; 
Reinforce Congress’s constitutional powers 
over spending and the power of the purse by 
requiring the Office of Management and 
Budget to make public basic information 
about the management of federal funds, and 
reporting to Congress to ensure those funds 
are spent in accordance with the law; 
Prevent political interference with the 
U.S. Department of Justice by putting a per-
manent, statutory requirement in place that 
will ensure transparency and accountability 
related to their communications with the 
White House; 
Strengthen the Hatch Act to protect fed-
eral agencies from being used for political 
purposes and ensure senior political ap-
pointees are held accountable under the law 
the same way other federal employees are. 
Prevent abuse of the president’s pardon 
power by increasing transparency of the par-
don process, prohibiting self-pardons by the 
president, and clarifying that pardons are 
‘‘official acts’’ for the purposes of federal 
bribery statute; 
Provide for enforcement of the domestic 
and foreign Emoluments Clauses of the Con-
stitution, to prevent a president from prof-
iting from payments by foreign or domestic 
governments; and 
Secure our elections from foreign inter-
ference, by ensuring political campaigns are 
informed of the laws banning foreign inter-
ference and are prepared to comply and re-
port any attempts of foreign interference. 
In this perilous moment for our republic, 
we believe it should be a top priority for this 
Congress to repair our democracy, including 
ensuring that no future president is per-
mitted to abuse the power of their office. 
If enacted, the Protecting Our Democracy 
Act would protect against future presi-
dential abuses of power, restore the integrity 
of our democratic institutions, and ensure 
transparency from the chief executive. 
Given the urgency of this crisis and for 
these reasons, we call on you to swiftly pass 
this critical legislation.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from the great State 
of Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), the 
distinguished chair of the Committee 
on Ways and Means Subcommittee on 
Worker and Family Support. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair for 
yielding me time. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 5314, 
Protecting Our Democracy Act. 
Democracy generates the notion and 
the idea that people will get and be en-
gaged, involved, heard, and have their 
wishes met. 
I agree with my colleague from Illi-
nois when he said voters all over the 
country vote for us and they send us 
here. They vote for our colleagues in 
the Senate and send them there. We 
make laws. Then they expect those 
laws to be adhered to. No one is above 
them. No President. 
And we are not obsessed with the 
former President, but we are obsessed 
with the idea and the hope that we will 
never have another administration like 
that one. And that is what this legisla-
tion is designed to do. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. DONALDS). 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ex-
press my firm opposition to the Pro-
tecting Our Democracy Act, otherwise 
known as PODA. 
I don’t have much time to get into a 
bunch of the provisions, but there are 
many troubling provisions that the 
American people should be fully aware 
of. 
First, PODA empowers the GSA to 
provide highly sensitive information 
intended only for the President-elect to 
the nonvictor if the GSA administrator 
doesn’t certify election results within 5 
days. This would result in an explicit 
conflict of interest, and there is no rea-
son for this political-based decision. It 
just simply doesn’t make any sense, 
Madam Speaker. 
Secondarily, PODA directly targets 
President Trump—and I know our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
say it doesn’t expressly go after Presi-
dent Trump, but it does—over his re-
fusal not to disclose his tax records by 
requiring a Presidential candidate to 
submit their income tax returns for the 
prior 10 years within 15 days of their 
nomination. 
Now, Madam Speaker, the whole pur-
pose of looking at tax returns, quite 
frankly, is to see if you are in violation 
of tax law. There is a certain thing 
called a tax lien, and so if the IRS 
wants to yield a tax lien against an in-
dividual, that is clear proof to the 
American people that there is an issue 
with a nominee for the highest office in 
the land not abiding by tax law in the 
United States. 
This is completely politically moti-
vated, specifically against President 
Trump.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7589 
December 9, 2021 
Last but not least, Madam Speaker, 
PODA massively expands FEC’s juris-
diction, thereby continuing the Demo-
crats’ ongoing trend of heavy-handed 
Federal involvement and intrusion into 
State rights. 
I have heard on this floor, being down 
here for a few minutes, about the de-
sire for Congress to want to be able to 
have more leverage to hold the execu-
tive accountable. One thing Congress 
should be doing is stop actually yield-
ing so much rulemaking and regu-
latory authority to the alphabet soup 
of agencies and Congress actually 
doing that work here, as opposed to 
creating a bill which is obviously tar-
geted with one President in mind and 
trying to create a new rubric here in 
Congress. 
Secondarily, and I think if we can 
look at some of the metrics associated 
with where the United States is right 
now versus where the United States 
was at the same time 4 years ago, it is 
without question what a successful ad-
ministration looks like, one that actu-
ally always followed the law, was in 
constant standing with the law, as op-
posed to an administration who issues 
mandates that are unconstitutional 
that the Federal courts, as we speak, 
are undermining every single day. 
This is a bad bill. I urge Members to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Florida. 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, if 
you want to hold the executive ac-
countable, if we want to increase Con-
gress’ role in parity with the executive 
there are far more things that we 
should be doing instead of this bill. We 
should be voting ‘‘no.’’ 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. CONNOLLY), the chair of the Sub-
committee on Government Operations 
of the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the distinguished 
chairwoman of the Oversight and Re-
form Committee for yielding. 
We just heard obfuscation on the 
floor of the House hoping that people 
watching will be distracted from the 
purpose of this bill, which is to counter 
the systematic voter suppression that 
is occurring in Republican-controlled 
States all over America. 
Instead of enshrining the right to 
vote and enabling it, Republicans want 
to suppress it, they want to narrow it, 
they want to make it harder for you to 
vote. Because that is how they win 
elections, apparently. 
This bill, the Protecting Our Democ-
racy Act, led by Mr. SCHIFF
would 
counter that, would enshrine and pro-
tect that sacred franchise, which is 
what America was founded to be. 
I also want to highlight an amend-
ment to the bill I provided. On October 
21, President Trump signed Executive 
Order No. 13957 to undermine the merit 
system protection of our Federal work-
force by requiring agency heads to re-
classify 
policy-determining, 
policy-
making, 
or 
policy-advocating 
posi-
tions. 
At OMB, the Office of Management 
and Budget, this meant 80 percent of 
its workforce could suddenly be fired or 
eligible to be fired by the executive. 
The Preventing a Patronage System 
Act preserves congressional preroga-
tive by freezing that executive branch 
ability to unilaterally remove classes 
of Federal employees and restore the 
civil service as a nonpartisan entity. 
I’m proud to support and cosponsor 
this bill. I urge its passage. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
It is disappointing that my friend 
from 
Virginia 
would 
spew 
disinformation about what States are 
doing. Every State is making it easier 
to vote but harder to cheat, and he 
knows that. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE), the distinguished 
chair of the Committee on the Judici-
ary Subcommittee on Crime, Ter-
rorism, and Homeland Security. 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairwoman for her leader-
ship. 
Madam Speaker, it is not about 
President Trump but it is about his be-
havior. But it is overall about the sanc-
tity of democracy and the recognition 
that behaviors result in the final des-
tination that challenges the very core 
of democracy. January 6, 2021, when 
Members duly sworn to take an oath to 
defend this Nation and to uphold the 
Constitution were cowering on the 
floor. 
I stand with enormous support for 
the Protecting Our Democracy Act. 
Why? Because the Nation needs it and 
the world is watching. I stand to avoid 
the abuse of the pardon powers that ex-
isted clearly in the last administra-
tion. Need I give a long list of exam-
ples? Generals and best friends; or then 
enforcement of the foreign and domes-
tic emolument clauses; the horrors of a 
hotel where many went to pay money 
into the coffers of a President of the 
United States or enforcement of Con-
gressional subpoenas, the very author-
ity that can protect democracy, re-
asserting Congressional power of the 
purse when dollars were manipulated 
and friends got a lot of dollars. 
So I am believing that this is impera-
tive, security from political inter-
ference injustice. I might think a noose 
hanging in the front to insist that Vice 
President Pence be arrested or hung 
might be an interference. I do want to 
acknowledge the amendment that I of-
fered, very quickly. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield an addi-
tional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. The amendment 
indicates that violation by office-
holders be treated as a violation of 
oath of office for purposes of ineligi-
bility to hold public office under the 
14th Amendment. 
And so the collective actions, not a 
person, but if your actions suggest that 
you 
are 
violating 
democracy, 
you 
should not ever run again. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
this amendment becoming law, and I 
look forward to this bill becoming law 
because we must protect democracy. 
The Constitution says that we have 
been created to create a more perfect 
union. I insist that we create a more 
perfect union. Support this great legis-
lation. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
QUIGLEY). 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding. 
The reforms in this bill have been 
needed for a long time. It is just that 
the 
previous 
administration 
only 
brought out those needs in sharp relief. 
This legislation will bolster account-
ability, ensure that elected officials 
use their offices to serve the American 
people, not for personal gain. 
James Madison wrote, ‘‘If angels 
were to govern men, neither external 
nor internal controls on government 
would be necessary.’’ If we haven’t no-
ticed, we are down a few angels. 
‘‘You must first enable the govern-
ment to control the governed,’’ he 
wrote, ‘‘and in the next place oblige it 
to control itself.’’ How he knew. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is not 
about looking back, it is about learn-
ing from our mistakes of the past to 
prevent future abuses of power. I urge 
support for this bill. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER
FERNANDEZ), the distin-
guished chair of the Committee on Nat-
ural Resources and Subcommittee on 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
of 
the 
United 
States. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, our democracy is precious and 
it must be protected. The last adminis-
tration did test and attack it. We know 
we must take action against tyranny. 
Tyranny battered our doors on January 
6, and on this floor today, we are going 
to fight back and strengthen our de-
mocracy. This act restores account-
ability, ensures no one—no one, not 
even, and more importantly, never the 
President—is above the law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7590 
December 9, 2021 
Foreign governments are interfering 
in our elections. The last President 
welcomed 
and 
clamored 
for 
inter-
ference in his bid for reelection. This 
bill 
in 
contrast 
protects 
whistle-
blowers, it roots out corruption, it pre-
vents Presidential abuses of power to 
keep our system of checks and balances 
sound. 
These principles are not partisan, 
they are simply American. There is 
nothing more American than voting for 
a bill to protect our democracy and the 
future of our Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I stand and I ask all 
my colleagues to stand with our Con-
stitution. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from Kentucky for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, our most basic duty 
of the Federal Government should be 
protecting the right for our citizens to 
vote, but we are not doing everything 
we can to protect that. A disturbing 
trend across the country is that more 
and more States and localities are al-
lowing noncitizens to vote. Further-
more, many States are conducting 
elections that rely on wildly outdated 
voter lists, many of which include 
these noncitizens. 
In some States, such as California, 
the voter rolls are so outdated that 
they have more registered voters than 
people who reside in the State. This 
creates a potential for our citizens’ 
votes to be diluted. LA County had 
over 1.5 million ineligible people on 
their voter rolls. A suit filed by a non-
partisan watch dog alleged that LA 
County had 112 percent of its adult citi-
zens registered to vote. 
Under pressure, California and LA 
County finally agreed to clean up their 
voter rolls in 2019. Unfortunately, when 
then-California 
Secretary 
of 
State 
ALEX PADILLA appeared before my com-
mittee in 2020, he could not confirm 
that many of those ineligible people 
had actually been removed from Cali-
fornia’s unmaintained voter rolls. I do 
not have a lot of faith that California 
is doing everything it can to protect 
the integrity of our elections. 
And then there is New York City, 
which just decided to allow nearly a 
million noncitizens to vote in city elec-
tions. New York can make its own bad 
decisions, but it is our job to ensure 
that we protect Federal elections. 
Common sense will tell you that com-
bining noncitizens and eligible Amer-
ican voters on the same voter rolls is 
ripe for abuse. 
I will also use a final example from 
my home State of Illinois. In Illinois, 
noncitizens cannot vote, and if they do, 
they face major legal consequences and 
could be deported. But in 2016, Illinois’ 
automatic voter registration program 
mistakenly registered to vote more 
than 500 noncitizens who had done the 
right thing by checking the box stating 
that they are not citizens on their driv-
er’s license application. However, sev-
eral of these noncitizens voted in the 
2018 and 2019 elections. 
This does nothing to bolster voter 
confidence in our elections; in fact, it 
does the opposite. 
Not only does this undermine the in-
tegrity of our elections, the mistake by 
Illinois could have had dire con-
sequences for these individuals, and it 
could be prevented if States were being 
forced to maintain accurate voter rolls. 
Whether intentional or not, we know 
this is happening. It is undermining 
the integrity of our elections. 
This amendment would simply en-
sure those who are noncitizens who do 
not have the right to vote in Federal 
elections are removed from States’ 
voter rolls. As someone who has at-
tended many citizenship ceremonies as 
a Member of Congress, it is unthink-
able that we have States undermining 
what it means to be a citizen of this 
great country. 
My office has helped many immi-
grants go through the legal process to 
become American citizens, and there is 
nothing better than seeing them raise 
their right hand and swear to support 
and defend our Constitution; to swear 
to bear arms in defense of this Nation; 
to swear allegiance to this great coun-
try. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, there is nothing bet-
ter than to think that their vote, 
something they worked hard to get, 
the right to vote on something that 
they worked hard to get the right to do 
is being undermined. That is unthink-
able. 
Let’s pass this amendment to ensure 
only citizens are voting in our elec-
tions and prevent States from putting 
noncitizens at risk of intentionally or 
unintentionally breaking the law and 
illegally voting in our elections. 
We will offer this solution as a mo-
tion to recommit. If we adopt the mo-
tion to recommit, we will instruct the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform to 
consider an amendment to ensure 
States remove noncitizens from their 
voter rolls as part of a regular com-
prehensive list maintenance program. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Rhode Island 
(Mr. CICILLINE), the distinguished chair 
of the Committee on the Judiciary, 
Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commer-
cial and Administrative Law. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, the 
blatant and corrupt actions that we 
saw during the Trump administration 
demand that Congress take action to 
prevent any future President or admin-
istration officials from committing 
these same abuses of power. 
Our laws have to be equipped to pro-
tect the Office of the Presidency and 
hold anyone privileged enough to hold 
that office accountable for their ac-
tions. 
The Protecting Our Democracy Act 
will prevent Presidential abuse, restore 
our system of checks and balances, 
strengthen accountability, and protect 
our elections. 
I am proud that this package in-
cludes one of my pieces of legislation, 
the White House Open Data Act, which 
will make White House visitor logs and 
salary information easily accessible 
and available to the public. The Presi-
dency demands integrity and trans-
parency. The Protecting Our Democ-
racy Act gives us the tools to defend 
and protect our democracy; our most 
sacred responsibility. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
SCHIFF for his leadership, and I thank 
Chairwoman MALONEY. Let’s all stand 
up today, vote for democracy, protect 
the right to vote so that the world, 
when they watch this, knows that 
America remains committed and re-
news today its commitment to a great 
democracy. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky has 91⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Kentucky for yielding. 
I was just sitting on the floor and it 
occurred to me, as I listened to the de-
bate, that the point just has to be 
made that the majority is so obsessed 
with Donald Trump that they will run 
roughshod over the Constitution to 
continue to try to persecute him. 
Do they not see that they twice-im-
peached him and the court of impeach-
ment twice acquitted him? 
Do they defer to the decision of our 
constitutional process in terms of what 
was just characterized that the Presi-
dent did? Or do they stubbornly over-
ride that and continue to pursue him 
endlessly, despite what our processes 
and constitutional provisions require 
and provide for? 
What about the provision requiring 
Presidents, who the Constitution speci-
fies the qualifications for office, that 
they be required to submit private tax 
returns in order to pursue that office? 
Perhaps, if you’d like it, if it is a tradi-
tion to do so, for you to impose it by 
law means you disregard the Constitu-
tion of the United States. 
To what end will you go? To what 
end will you go to prevail? 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. DEAN).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7591 
December 9, 2021 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, speaking of running 
roughshod, no President—Republican 
or Democrat—is above the law, but 
some have tried to be. The previous 
President and his sad followers ignored 
subpoenas, 
punished 
whistleblowers, 
and invited foreign interference in our 
elections. Congress—Republicans and 
Democrats—must act to protect our 
democracy from any future reckless 
Presidents, which is why the Pro-
tecting Our Democracy Act is crucial. 
This bill will strengthen our institu-
tions against future Presidents who 
seek to abuse their power. 
January 6 showed us that Presi-
dential abuse can find its way to a 
joint session of Congress in a deadly 
way—140 police officers injured; several 
police officers dead; desecration; trau-
ma. That is why the work of the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Cap-
itol is so critical. Their subpoenas can-
not be ignored. 
My Congressional Subpoena Compli-
ance and Enforcement Act, which is in-
cluded in this bill, will standardize and 
streamline the process so that no one 
can ignore a subpoena with impunity. 
The previous President’s abuses re-
veal the dangerous fault line. 
b 1330 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New

(Ms. PORTER), the distinguished chair 
of the Committee on Natural Resources 
Subcommittee on Oversight and Inves-
tigation. 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I in-
troduced the Stop Foreign Interference 
in Ballot Measures Act to ban foreign 
contributions to State and local ballot 
initiatives and referenda. I am proud 
that my bill is part of the Protecting 
Our Democracy Act. 
Foreign interference in our politics 
ranges 
from 
social 
media 
disinformation paid for by our adver-
saries to dictators bankrolling lob-
bying on Capitol Hill. Current law per-
mits billions of dollars of foreign influ-
ence in ballot initiatives. Last year, 
over $750 million was spent in Cali-
fornia alone. 
We prohibit foreign contributions to 
candidates because it protects our na-
tional security. That same rationale 
should apply to foreign contributions 
to ballot initiatives and referenda. 
That is why we must pass my bill. 
Money and politics distort the will of 
the American people. It advantages 
special interests and limits the power 
of 
regular 
Americans. 
When 
that 
money is supplied by foreign countries 
and adversaries, it puts our democracy 
and our national security at risk. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina (Ms. ROSS), the distinguished vice 
chair of the Committee on the Judici-
ary Subcommittee on the Constitution, 
Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today as a proud cosponsor of the Pro-
tecting Our Democracy Act, which en-
sures that our government remains of, 
by, and for the people. 
I also rise in support of my amend-
ment, which would establish a task 
force within the Department of Justice 
to investigate and prosecute, in col-
laboration with State and local govern-
ments, threats to election officials. 
Poll workers in my home State of 
North Carolina and their families have 
been subjected to harassment, violent 
threats, and intimidation, all exacer-
bated by baseless conspiracies like stop 
the steal. 
We suffered critical shortages of poll 
workers during the 2020 elections, and 
over one-quarter of counties in North 
Carolina had understaffed polling sites. 
Threats to election officials are threats 
to our democracy and must be stopped. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support poll workers, the 
democratic process, my amendment, 
and the bill. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. ESHOO), the distinguished chair of 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce Subcommittee on Health. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Congresswoman MALONEY for her spe-
cial leadership. I am so proud of my 
classmate. 
Madam Speaker, as we gather here 
on the floor, it really is a somber day 
here at the Capitol with the remains of 
the former majority leader of the Sen-
ate, Senator Robert Dole. He was a 
man who fought for our democracy, 
paid for it in terms of the injuries that 
he sustained during the war, and came 
to Congress to defend our democracy. 
That is what we are doing here on the 
floor of the House. We are working to 
protect our democracy. I am proud 
that my legislation is included in this. 
Let me say a few words about it. 
Since Watergate, Presidential can-
didates and Vice Presidential can-
didates voluntarily put their tax re-
turns out to the public. In 2016, there 
were two that were running, one on 
each side, that did not do that. I ob-
served it. I was upset about it. I wrote 
legislation on it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield such 
time as she may consume to the gen-
tlewoman from California. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, what 
this legislation does is make it a re-
quirement for those who seek the Pres-
idency and the Vice Presidency to put 
out to the public their tax returns. 
Why? Tax returns contain vital infor-
mation: whether a candidate has paid 
any taxes, what assets they own, how 
much they have borrowed, who they 
borrowed it from, have they taken ad-
vantage of tax loopholes of offshore tax 
shelters, whether they have foreign 
bank accounts, and if they have made 
charitable contributions. 
Truth and transparency need to be a 
part of the democratic process. I am 
very proud and grateful that my legis-
lation is contained in a bill that over-
all is called the Protecting Our Democ-
racy Act. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
all 
colleagues 
should vote for this because we raised 
our hands and pledged to protect our 
democracy and defend it against all en-
emies, foreign and domestic. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league. We came to Congress together, 
and I thank her for her outstanding 
leadership in this body and her beau-
tiful statement today. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 31⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I have no fur-
ther speakers. I am prepared to close, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, wow, I heard Donald 
Trump’s name mentioned at least a 
dozen times by my colleagues across 
the aisle. I am sincerely glad that the 
Democrats spent so much time inves-
tigating the President for wrongdoing. 
I am glad that they issued subpoenas 
investigating the President for wrong-
doing. I am very happy that, in all the 
investigations conducted by the Intel-
ligence Committee and Oversight and 
Reform Committee, they did not find 
one ounce of wrongdoing committed by 
President Trump. 
I am also happy that they inves-
tigated President Trump’s children. I 
think that is fair game. I can promise 
the American people that very soon 
there will be that type of oversight for 
the 
Biden 
administration 
and 
the 
President’s son, Hunter, who is in the 
news almost on a daily basis for things 
that just don’t add up. They just don’t 
look good. That oversight is coming. 
The American people can count on 
that. 
Madam Speaker, after nearly a year 
in power, it is time for Democrats to 
actually start governing and abandon 
their obsession with Donald Trump. 
H.R. 5314 is full of bad policy that di-
minishes the power of the executive 
branch and entrenches Washington bu-
reaucrats making law based on false 
conspiracy theories of the bill’s spon-
sor. 
The bill has not proceeded through 
regular order and is a Frankenstein’s 
monster stitched together from various 
committees’ jurisdictions, while other 
whole portions have never undergone 
committee review at all. 
There has been no attempt to seri-
ously vet these substantial changes,

minimal cooperation with the minor-
ity, and no apparent path for the bill in 
the Senate. 
In other words, Madam Speaker, H.R. 
5314 is a messaging bill to bolster the 
fundraising efforts of Democrat Mem-
bers in preparation for the 2022 mid-
terms. The Democratic Party should 
try governing instead. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill and oppose 
this reckless legislation. I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
point out to my very good friend and 
colleague, Mr. COMER, that President 
Trump is no longer President. This bill 
is not about President Trump. If any-
one, it is about President Biden and 
our future Presidents and having more 
oversight, accountability, and trans-
parency. 
Now, addressed in this bill are past 
abuses that have occurred. This is not 
about the past; it is about the future. 
It is about the future of our democracy 
and the strength of our democracy. 
Democrats are not standing alone. 
The reforms in this bill have broad sup-
port from over 150 outstanding groups, 
including the Brennan Center for Jus-
tice, the Project On Government Over-
sight, and many others. I have included 
that list in the RECORD. 
Madam Speaker, the Protecting Our 
Democracy Act is a historic package of 
prodemocracy reforms to create or 
strengthen guardrails and prevent the 
abuse of executive power. Many of the 
provisions in our bill have broad bipar-
tisan support and have literally been 
authored by Republicans. 
You yourself at the Rules Committee 
said that the President should release 
his taxes. You said that. 
These are issues that both sides of 
the aisle should be supporting. It is 
time for Congress to restore our au-
thorities as a coequal branch of power. 
Madam Speaker, this is about the fu-
ture, the strengthening of our democ-
racy, and I urge strong support from 
all of my colleagues. I urge my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
join us in strengthening democracy and 
urge them to vote with Republicans for 
this very important reform bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, our gov-
ernment is not a piggy bank to be pilfered and 
pillaged by public servants. Trump appointees 
abused their public office to line their pockets 
and corruptly retain power. The crime spree 
by Trump and his stooges is the worst corrup-
tion ever in our government. 
According to a recent Office of Special 
Counsel report, they made a mockery of the 
law. They exploited Hatch Act gaps or ignored 
it altogether. 
My amendment in the en bloc is based on 
the 
Political 
CRIMES 
Act. 
I 
thank 
Congressmam MIKE
QUIGLEY
and Senator 
ELIZABETH WARREN for their leadership. The 
amendment enhances the underlying provi-
sions and gives the Hatch Act sharper teeth. 
The 
amendment 
ensures 
political 
ap-
pointees cannot get away with crimes. It re-
quires disclosure of investigations. It cracks 
down on subpoena evaders. It allows the Spe-
cial Counsel to continue investigations after 
government service concludes. Offenders like 
Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller, and 
those masquerading as public servants like 
Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, violated the 
Hatch Act without major consequence. No 
longer. 
The amendment also expands the fines for 
violations. For the first time, repeat violators 
can be held criminally liable. This is real ac-
countability. 
Most important, it extends the law to the 
President and Vice President when conducting 
official duties on federal property. 
You fix a leaky roof in the sun. Not in a 
storm. With dark clouds ahead, we must pro-
tect our democracy. 
I am glad my amendment was included, and 
for the Presidential tax return transparency 
provisions in the bill. Trump and his enablers 
refused to follow the law. For 981 days— 
longer than the siege of Leningrad—our tax 
return request was illegally blocked by a tag- 
team of the Trump Department of Justice and 
a Trump-appointed judge. 
Now that the Biden administration will com-
ply with the law, the returns should be sent to 
Congress. 
I urge passage of my amendment and pas-
sage of the underlying bill. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5314, the 
‘‘Protecting Our Democracy Act,’’ spearheaded 
by my friend and colleague on the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 6th At-
tack on the United States Capitol, Adam 
Schiff. 
This bill bolsters congressional oversight au-
thority and the important powers vested in 
Congress by Article I of the Constitution. It 
also includes a host of other good-government 
measures to make our entire government 
more ethical and more accountable to the 
people we serve. 
As chairman of both the Committee on 
Homeland Security and the Select Committee 
to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the 
United States Capitol, I know firsthand how 
important congressional oversight is to our 
legislative process. And I have seen how dedi-
cated the forces aligned against representative 
democracy are. 
Protecting our democracy is protecting our 
homeland, 
and 
protecting 
our 
homeland 
means protecting our democracy. 
I am particularly supportive of title IV of this 
bill, which amends the United States Code to 
reaffirm the House’s right to enforce its sub-
poenas through civil suits in Federal court. 
The title would also expedite consideration of 
those suits in the courts and enhance pen-
alties for noncompliance with congressional 
subpoenas. 
While I firmly believe the House already 
possesses the ability to seek civil enforcement 
of its subpoenas, some recent court decisions 
have questioned it. This bill leaves no room 
for such doubt. 
Almost a century ago, the U.S. Supreme 
Court said that Congress needs information to 
govern wisely and effectively, and it must 
often seek out others—often by compulsion— 
to obtain it. To effectively exercise our legisla-
tive duties, the Constitution implicitly grants 
enforcing processes. 
Madam Speaker, this bill furthers our ability 
as legislators to do our job wisely and effec-
tively. I encourage my colleagues to join me in 
voting for the ‘‘Protecting Our Democracy 
Act.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, thank 
you for this opportunity to discuss briefly the 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 17 to Rules 
Committee Print 117–20, the Protecting Our 
Democracy Act (H.R. 5314), introduced by 
Congressman SCHIFF of California, the Chair 
of the House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence. 
This Jackson Lee amendment improves the 
bill and strengthens an important guardrail in 
the pillars upholding and protecting our de-
mocracy by providing that any person who, 
having previously taken an oath as an officer 
of the United States, as a member of a State 
legislature, or as an executive or judicial offi-
cer of any State, is finally convicted of vio-
lating laws prohibiting foreign interference in 
American elections, specifically section 304(j) 
of the Federal Election Campaign. 
The Protecting Our Democracy Act is a 
sweeping package of reforms to prevent presi-
dential abuses and to restore the Constitu-
tional system of checks and balances. 
Madam Speaker, the actions of the past Ad-
ministration revealed serious vulnerabilities in 
our democratic systems—vulnerabilities that 
can and will be exploited again if we do not 
act urgently to address them. 
The Protecting Our Democracy Act will take 
immediate steps to safeguard and strengthen 
our democracy so no future president—re-
gardless of political party—can act as if they 
are above the law. 
And it will restore the accountability and 
transparency of our institutions so that the 
American people can have confidence in our 
government’s ability to address the challenges 
we face. 
Let me briefly highlight some of the impor-
tant provisions of this vitally important legisla-
tion that should be enthusiastically supported 
by all Members. 
TITLE I—ABUSE OF THE PARDON POWER PREVENTION 
The Abuse of the Pardon Prevention Act is 
designed to deter abuses of the pardon 
power, first, by requiring transparency in cir-
cumstances where the President uses that 
power for potentially self-serving purposes or 
in a manner that could undermine the func-
tions of Congress. 
And second, by amending the federal brib-
ery statute to make explicit that offering or 
granting a pardon or commutation may serve 
as the basis for finding criminal culpability 
under the statute. 
Finally, the Abuse of the Pardon Prevention 
Act makes explicit that a president may not 
issue a self-pardon. 
TITLE II—ENSURING NO PRESIDENT IS ABOVE THE LAW 
The No President is Above the Law Act 
would suspend the statute of limitations for 
any federal offense committed by a sitting 
president or vice president, whether it was 
committed before or during their terms in of-
fice and thus ensure that presidents and vice 
presidents can be held accountable for crimi-
nal conduct just like every other American and 
not use their offices as a shield to avoid legal 
consequences.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7593 
December 9, 2021 
TITLE III—ENFORCEMENT EMOLUMENTS CLAUSES OF THE 
FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC EMOLUMENTS CLAUSES 
Madam Speaker, the Foreign Emoluments 
Clause of the Constitution prohibits federal of-
ficers from receiving ‘‘presents’’ or ‘‘emolu-
ments’’ from foreign nations unless Congress 
first provides its consent, while the Domestic 
Emoluments Clause bars the President from 
receiving any emoluments from the United 
States government or from any state govern-
ment. 
The Foreign and Domestic Emoluments En-
forcement Act codifies these foundational anti- 
corruption provisions and provides enhanced 
enforcement mechanisms for Congress and 
for entities within the Executive Branch. 
TITLE IV—ENFORCEMENT OF CONGRESSIONAL 
SUBPOENAS 
The Congressional Subpoena Compliance 
and Enforcement Act reinforces Congress’s 
Article I powers by strengthening its tools to 
enforce lawfully issued subpoenas. 
First, the bill affirms the House’s and Sen-
ate’s authority to enforce their subpoenas 
through civil suits and provides expedited 
processes for these actions, as well as en-
hanced penalties for noncompliance. 
Second, it specifies the manner in which 
subpoena recipients must comply, including by 
creating an express requirement to testify and 
produce subpoenaed information and, to the 
extent any information is withheld, to produce 
a detailed log describing the basis for non- 
compliance. 
TITLE V—REASSERTING CONGRESSIONAL POWER OF THE 
PURSE 
Madam Speaker, in drafting the Constitu-
tion, the Framers built checks and balances 
into the foundation of our democracy to pro-
tect against monarchy. 
Vesting Congress with the power to make 
funding decisions—the ‘‘power of the purse’’— 
is a critical component of that founding prin-
ciple. 
Congress 
has 
crafted 
longstanding, 
foundational laws to protect its authority like 
the Antideficiency Act (ADA) and the Impound-
ment Control Act (ICA) to prevent federal 
agencies from misusing federal funds. 
But over time, Presidents and Executive 
Branch agencies have pushed the boundaries 
of these and other laws designed to prevent 
executive overreach, exploiting secrecy and 
limitations on enforcement to push their own 
agenda. 
That is why as a member of the Budget 
Committee, I am very pleased that the reforms 
embodied in the Congressional Power of the 
Purse Act are incorporated in the legislation 
before us and will help Congress reclaim its 
Constitutional spending authority and safe-
guard our nation’s separation of powers. 
Specifically, the Act would restore Congress’ 
central role in funding decisions by preventing 
the President from effectively rescinding funds 
without congressional approval; requiring the 
Office of Management and Budget (0MB) to 
release funding at least 90 days before it ex-
pires, whether or not the funding is part of a 
Presidential rescission or deferral request; and 
closing a budget law loophole that essentially 
lets the President unilaterally block the spend-
ing of enacted appropriations designated as 
emergency. 
The Act would put an expiration date on 
Presidential declarations of national emer-
gencies and any special executive authorities 
triggered by those declarations; declarations 
would expire unless Congress extends them. 
The Act would increase transparency in the 
Executive Branch by requiring OMB to make 
apportionments (legally binding documents 
that make funding available to agencies to 
spend) publicly available and to publish the 
positions of officials with delegated apportion-
ment authority; requiring the DOJ Office of 
Legal Counsel (OLC) to publish opinions in-
structing agencies on budget and appropria-
tions law; requiring the Executive Branch to 
make public amounts and explanations of can-
celled or expired fund balances, and amounts 
and legal justifications of obligations incurred 
by agencies during a lapse in their appropria-
tions; and requiring the Executive Branch to 
report violations of the ICA and ADA identified 
by the Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) to Congress. 
The Act would also add enforcement mech-
anisms to budget law and deter lawbreaking 
by strengthening and expediting GAO’s ability 
to obtain information from agencies to assess 
compliance with budget or appropriations law; 
expediting GAO’s ability to sue agencies to re-
lease funds being impounded in violation of 
the ICA; authorizing administrative discipline 
for officials found to have violated the ICA, in-
cluding suspension without pay or termination 
of employment; and requiring the DOJ to re-
view reports of ADA violations and investigate 
whether a violation occurred knowingly and 
willfully. 
TITLE VI—SECURITY FROM POLITICAL INTERFERENCE IN 
JUSTICE 
Since Watergate, every Administration has 
issued guidance limiting contact between the 
White House and DOJ in order to limit political 
interference in criminal and civil enforcement 
matters. 
Unfortunately, in recent years we have seen 
numerous instances where that norm was ig-
nored. 
The Security from Political Interference in 
Justice Act seeks to help ensure that these 
norms are followed in the future, by requiring 
that the Attorney General (AG) maintain a log 
of certain designated contacts between the 
White House and DOJ that is to be shared 
with the DOJ Inspector General (IG) on a 
semi-annual basis, with an additional require-
ment that the IG share any inappropriate or 
improper contacts with the House and Senate 
Judiciary Committees. 
TITLE VII—PROTECTING INSPECTOR GENERAL 
INDEPENDENCE 
The Inspector General Independence Act 
would protect Inspectors General (IGs) from 
being removed by the President based on po-
litical retaliation. 
President Trump removed or replaced nu-
merous IGs in what appeared to be retaliation 
for investigating misconduct of his own Admin-
istration. 
The Inspector General Independence Act 
would only allow an IG to be removed for a 
limited number of causes and would require 
that the President, before removing the IG, 
provide Congress with documentation of the 
cause. 
TITLE VIII—PROTECTING WHISTLEBLOWERS 
The Whistleblower Protection Improvement 
Act would strengthen the law to ensure that 
federal employees who blow the whistle on 
waste, fraud, and abuse are protected from re-
taliation. 
The Whistleblower Protection Improvement 
Act would clarify that no federal official may 
interfere with a federal employee’s ability to 
share information with Congress. 
This measure would also limit disclosure of 
a whistleblower’s identity, prohibit retaliatory 
investigations, expand whistleblower protec-
tions to all noncareer appointees in the Senior 
Executive Service, and provide access to jury 
trials for whistleblowers. 
TITLE XII—PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL TAX 
TRANSPARENCY 
Title XII requires sitting presidents and vice 
presidents and major party candidates for the 
presidency and vice-presidency to publicly dis-
close their 10 most recent federal income tax 
returns. 
TITLE XIII—FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN ELECTIONS 
Title XIII of the Act requires political cam-
paigns, parties, and political committees like 
political action committees (PACs) and Super 
PACs to report attempts by foreign govern-
ments, foreign political parties, and their 
agents to influence our elections to the Fed-
eral Election Commission (FEC) and Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 
It requires the FBI to report on these notifi-
cations annually to the congressional intel-
ligence committees. 
It also requires campaigns to establish com-
pliance mechanisms. 
It ensures violations of these foreign contact 
reporting requirements can incur criminal or 
civil liability. 
Title XIV of the Act works to eliminate for-
eign interference in U.S. elections by making 
clear that the Federal Election Campaign Act 
prohibits the acceptance of opposition re-
search, polling, and other non-public informa-
tion relating to a candidate for federal, state, 
or local office by foreign governments and po-
litical parties for the purpose of influencing an 
election. 
It provides for enhanced criminal penalties 
for violations of this prohibition. 
It ensures that members and employees of 
political campaigns will be on notice of this 
prohibition by requiring the FEC to provide a 
written explanation of the prohibition to polit-
ical campaigns, and for campaigns to certify 
their receipt and understanding of the expla-
nation. 
Last, the legislation extends the ban on for-
eign national contributions to federal, state, 
and local elections to include ballot initiatives 
and referendums. 
Madam Speaker, I believe this excellent leg-
islation would be even stronger had Jackson 
Lee Amendment No. 17 been made in order. 
This Jackson Lee amendment would im-
prove the bill and strengthen an important 
guardrail in the pillars upholding and pro-
tecting our democracy by providing that any 
person who, having previously taken an oath 
as an officer of the United States, as a mem-
ber of a State legislature, or as an executive 
or judicial officer of any State, is finally con-
victed of violating laws prohibiting foreign in-
terference in American elections, specifically 
section 304(j) of the Federal Election Cam-
paign Act of 1971 (as added by section 
1301(a)), section 304(b)(9) of such Act (as 
added by section 1301(b)), or section 302(j) of 
such Act (as added by section 1302), shall be 
deemed to have given aid and comfort to the 
enemies of the United States for purposes of 
ineligibility to hold public office under section 
of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States. 
This concern is particularly salient when 
there is clear, convincing, and overwhelming 
evidence of interference by a hostile foreign

power to secure victory for its preferred can-
didate. 
Madam Speaker, there is compelling reason 
for the Congress to pass the Protecting Our 
Democracy Act by overwhelming margins in 
the House and Senate to send a clear mes-
sage to the world that unlike the immediately 
previous Administration, the current President 
and his Administration is determined and reso-
lute in taking effective action to deter and pre-
vent interference by foreign powers in Amer-
ican elections. 
Let us remember that the Intelligence Com-
munity Assessment (‘‘ICA’’) of January 2017 
assessed that Russian President Vladimir 
Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 
aimed at the US presidential election in which 
Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith 
in the US democratic process, denigrate 
Democratic presidential candidate and implac-
able foe of Vladimir Putin, former Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton, facilitate the election of 
Vladimir Putin’s preferred candidate, Donald J. 
Trump. 
Russia’s interference in the election proc-
esses of democratic countries was not new 
but a continuation of the ‘‘Translator Project,’’ 
an ongoing information warfare effort launched 
by Vladimir Putin in 2014 to use social media 
to manipulate public opinion and voters in 
western democracies. 
But instead of supporting the unanimous as-
sessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, 
the 45th President attacked and sought to dis-
credit and undermine the agencies and offi-
cials responsible for detecting and assessing 
Russian interference in the 2016 presidential 
election as well as those responsible for inves-
tigating and bringing to justice the conspirators 
who committed crimes against the United 
States our law enforcement. 
And to add shame to insult and injury, at a 
meeting in Helsinki, Finland, rather than em-
bracing the conclusions of the U.S. Intel-
ligence Community, the 45th President of the 
United States sided with Russian President 
Vladimir Putin in heaping scorn on the IC’s as-
sessment regarding Russian interference and 
called the U.S. Justice Department investiga-
tion into Russia’s interference led by Special 
Counsel Robert Mueller ‘‘the greatest political 
witch hunt in history.’’ 
As the Mueller Report concluded, ‘‘The Rus-
sian government interfered in the 2016 presi-
dential election in sweeping and systematic 
fashion.’’ 
In his only public remarks made since he 
was appointed at his farewell press con-
ference held at the Department of Justice on 
May 29, 2017, Special Counsel, Robert 
Mueller reiterated the ‘‘central allegation of our 
indictments—that there were multiple, system-
atic efforts to interfere in our election’’ and that 
‘‘allegation deserves the attention of every 
American.’’ 
Madam Speaker, American elections are to

ingful action to ensure that laws and regula-
tions provide the accountability and trans-
parency that is fundamental to our democ-
racy; 
(2) free and fair elections require both 
transparency and accountability which give 
the public a right to know the true sources 
of funding for political advertisements in 
order to make informed political choices and 
hold elected officials accountable; and

vertisements is essential to enforce other 
campaign finance laws, including the prohi-
bition on campaign spending by foreign na-
tionals.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Title III of the Federal 
Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 
30101 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new section: 
‘‘SEC. 325. PROHIBITION ON DISTRIBUTION OF 
MATERIALLY 
DECEPTIVE 
MEDIA 
PRIOR TO ELECTION. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
subsections (b) and (c), a person, political 
committee, or other entity shall not, within 
60 days of a election for Federal office at 
which a candidate for elective office will ap-
pear on the ballot, distribute, with actual 
malice, materially deceptive audio or visual 
media of the candidate with the intent to in-
jure the candidate’s reputation or to deceive 
a voter into voting for or against the can-
didate. 
‘‘(b) EXCEPTION.— 
‘‘(1) REQUIRED LANGUAGE.—The prohibition 
in subsection (a) does not apply if the audio 
or visual media includes— 
‘‘(A) a disclosure stating: ‘‘This lllll 
has been manipulated.’’; and 
‘‘(B) filled in the blank in the disclosure 
under subparagraph (A), the term ‘image’, 
‘video’, or ‘audio’, as most accurately de-
scribes the media. 
‘‘(2) VISUAL MEDIA.—For visual media, the 
text of the disclosure shall appear in a size 
that is easily readable by the average viewer 
and no smaller than the largest font size of 
other text appearing in the visual media. If 
the visual media does not include any other 
text, the disclosure shall appear in a size 
that is easily readable by the average viewer. 
For visual media that is video, the disclosure 
shall appear for the duration of the video. 
‘‘(3) AUDIO-ONLY MEDIA.—If the media con-
sists of audio only, the disclosure shall be 
read in a clearly spoken manner and in a 
pitch that can be easily heard by the average 
listener, at the beginning of the audio, at the 
end of the audio, and, if the audio is greater 
than 2 minutes in length, interspersed within 
the audio at intervals of not greater than 2 
minutes each. 
‘‘(c) INAPPLICABILITY
TO
CERTAIN
ENTI-
TIES.—This section does not apply to the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(1) A radio or television broadcasting sta-
tion, including a cable or satellite television 
operator, programmer, or producer, that 
broadcasts materially deceptive audio or vis-
ual media prohibited by this section as part 
of a bona fide newscast, news interview, news 
documentary, or on-the-spot coverage of 
bona fide news events, if the broadcast clear-
ly acknowledges through content or a disclo-
sure, in a manner that can be easily heard or 
read by the average listener or viewer, that 
there are questions about the authenticity of 
the materially deceptive audio or visual 
media. 
‘‘(2) A radio or television broadcasting sta-
tion, including a cable or satellite television 
operator, programmer, or producer, when it 
is paid to broadcast materially deceptive 
audio or visual media. 
‘‘(3) An internet website, or a regularly 
published newspaper, magazine, or other pe-
riodical of general circulation, including an 
internet or electronic publication, that rou-
tinely carries news and commentary of gen-
eral interest, and that publishes materially 
deceptive audio or visual media prohibited 
by this section, if the publication clearly 
states that the materially deceptive audio or 
visual media does not accurately represent 
the speech or conduct of the candidate. 
‘‘(4) Materially deceptive audio or visual 
media that constitutes satire or parody. 
‘‘(d) CIVIL ACTION.— 
‘‘(1) INJUNCTIVE
OR
OTHER
EQUITABLE
RE-
LIEF.—A candidate for elective office whose 
voice or likeness appears in a materially de-
ceptive audio or visual media distributed in 
violation of this section may seek injunctive 
or other equitable relief prohibiting the dis-
tribution of audio or visual media in viola-
tion of this section. An action under this 
paragraph shall be entitled to precedence in 
accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. 
‘‘(2) DAMAGES.—A candidate for elective of-
fice whose voice or likeness appears in a ma-
terially deceptive audio or visual media dis-
tributed in violation of this section may 
bring an action for general or special dam-
ages against the person, committee, or other 
entity that distributed the materially decep-
tive audio or visual media. The court may 
also award a prevailing party reasonable at-
torney’s fees and costs. This paragraph shall 
not be construed to limit or preclude a plain-
tiff from securing or recovering any other 
available remedy. 
‘‘(3) BURDEN OF PROOF.—In any civil action 
alleging a violation of this section, the 
plaintiff shall bear the burden of establishing 
the violation through clear and convincing 
evidence. 
‘‘(e) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—This section 
shall not be construed to alter or negate any 
rights, obligations, or immunities of an 
interactive service provider under section 230 
of title 47, United States Code. 
‘‘(f) MATERIALLY DECEPTIVE AUDIO OR VIS-
UAL MEDIA DEFINED.—In this section, the 
term ‘materially deceptive audio or visual 
media’ means an image or an audio or video 
recording 
of 
a 
candidate’s 
appearance, 
speech, or conduct that has been inten-
tionally manipulated in a manner such that 
both of the following conditions are met: 
‘‘(1) The image or audio or video recording 
would falsely appear to a reasonable person 
to be authentic. 
‘‘(2) The image or audio or video recording 
would cause a reasonable person to have a 
fundamentally different understanding or 
impression of the expressive content of the 
image or audio or video recording than that 
person would have if the person were hearing 
or seeing the unaltered, original version of 
the image or audio or video recording.’’. 
(b) CRIMINAL PENALTIES.—Section 309(d)(1) 
of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971

‘‘(G) Any person who knowingly and will-
fully commits a violation of section 325 shall 
be fined not more than $100,000, imprisoned 
not more than 5 years, or both.’’. 
(c) EFFECT
ON DEFAMATION ACTION.—For 
purposes of an action for defamation, a viola-
tion of section 325 of the Federal Election 
Campaign Act of 1971, as added by subsection 
(a), shall constitute defamation per se.

Every appointee in every executive agency 
appointed on or after January 20, 2021, shall 
sign, and upon signing shall be contractually 
committed to, the following pledge upon be-
coming an appointee: 
‘‘I recognize that this pledge is part of a 
broader ethics in government plan designed 
to restore and maintain public trust in gov-
ernment, and I commit myself to conduct 
consistent with that plan. I commit to deci-
sion-making on the merits and exclusively in 
the public interest, without regard to private 
gain or personal benefit. I commit to con-
duct that upholds the independence of law 
enforcement and precludes improper inter-
ference with investigative or prosecutorial 
decisions of the Department of Justice. I 
commit to ethical choices of post-Govern-
ment employment that do not raise the ap-
pearance that I have used my Government 
service for private gain, including by using 
confidential information acquired and rela-
tionships established for the benefit of future 
clients. 
‘‘Accordingly, as a condition, and in con-
sideration, of my employment in the United 
States Government in a position invested 
with the public trust, I commit myself to the 
following obligations, which I understand are 
binding on me and are enforceable under law: 
‘‘(1) Lobbyist Gift Ban.—I will not accept 
gifts from registered lobbyists or lobbying 
organizations for the duration of my service 
as an appointee. 
‘‘(2) Revolving Door Ban; All Appointees 
Entering Government.—I will not for a pe-
riod of 2 years from the date of my appoint-
ment participate in any particular matter 
involving specific parties that is directly and 
substantially related to my former employer 
or former clients, including regulations and 
contracts. 
‘‘(3) Revolving Door Ban; Lobbyists and 
Registered Agents Entering Government.—If 
I was registered under the Lobbying Disclo-
sure Act, 2 U.S.C. 1601 et seq., or the Foreign 
Agents Registration Act (FARA), 22 U.S.C. 
611 et seq., within the 2 years before the date 
of my appointment, in addition to abiding by 
the limitations of paragraph 2, I will not for 
a period of 2 years after the date of my ap-
pointment: 
‘‘(A) participate in any particular matter 
on which I lobbied, or engaged in registrable 
activity under FARA, within the 2 years be-
fore the date of my appointment; 
‘‘(B) participate in the specific issue area 
in which that particular matter falls; or 
‘‘(C) seek or accept employment with any 
executive agency with respect to which I lob-
bied, or engaged in registrable activity under 
FARA, within the 2 years before the date of 
my appointment. 
‘‘(4) Revolving Door Ban; Appointees Leav-
ing Government.—If, upon my departure 
from the Government, I am covered by the 
post-employment restrictions on commu-
nicating with employees of my former execu-
tive agency set forth in section 207(c) of title 
18, United States Code, and its implementing 
regulations, I agree that I will abide by those 
restrictions for a period of 2 years following 
the end of my appointment. I will abide by 
these same restrictions with respect to com-
municating with the senior White House 
staff. 
‘‘(5) Revolving Door Ban; Senior and Very 
Senior Appointees Leaving Government.— If, 
upon my departure from the Government, I 
am covered by the post-employment restric-
tions set forth in sections 207(c) or 207(d) of 
title 18, United States Code, and those sec-
tions’ implementing regulations, I agree 
that, in addition, for a period of 1 year fol-
lowing the end of my appointment, I will not 
materially assist others in making commu-
nications or appearances that I am prohib-
ited from undertaking myself by— 
‘‘(A) holding myself out as being available 
to engage in lobbying activities in support of 
any such communications or appearances; or 
‘‘(B) engaging in any such lobbying activi-
ties. 
‘‘(6) Revolving Door Ban; Appointees Leav-
ing Government to Lobby.—In addition to 
abiding by the limitations of paragraph 4, I 
also agree, upon leaving Government service, 
not to lobby any covered executive branch 
official or non-career Senior Executive Serv-
ice appointee, or engage in any activity on 
behalf of any foreign government or foreign 
political party which, were it undertaken on 
January 20, 2021, would require that I reg-
ister under FARA, for the remainder of the 
Administration or 2 years following the end 
of my appointment, whichever is later. 
‘‘(7) Golden Parachute Ban.—I have not ac-
cepted and will not accept, including after 
entering Government, any salary or other 
cash payment from my former employer the 
eligibility for and payment of which is lim-
ited to individuals accepting a position in 
the United States Government. I also have 
not accepted and will not accept any non- 
cash benefit from my former employer that 
is provided in lieu of such a prohibited cash 
payment. 
‘‘(8) Employment Qualification Commit-
ment.—I agree that any hiring or other em-
ployment decisions I make will be based on 
the candidate’s qualifications, competence, 
and experience.

SEC. 1013. WAIVER. 
(a) The Director of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget (OMB), in consultation 
with the Counsel to the President, may 
grant to any current or former appointee a 
written waiver of any restrictions contained 
in the pledge signed by such appointee if, and 
to the extent that, the Director of OMB cer-
tifies in writing:— 
(1) that the literal application of the re-
striction is inconsistent with the purposes of 
the restriction; or 
(2) that it is in the public interest to grant 
the waiver. Any such written waiver should 
reflect the basis for the waiver and, in the 
case of a waiver of the restrictions set forth 
in paragraphs (3)(B) and (C) of the pledge, a 
discussion of the findings with respect to the 
factors set forth in subsection (b) of this sec-
tion. 
(b) A waiver shall take effect when the cer-
tification is signed by the Director of OMB 
and shall be made public within 10 days 
thereafter. 
(c) The public interest shall include, but 
not be limited to, exigent circumstances re-
lating to national security, the economy, 
public health, or the environment. In deter-
mining whether it is in the public interest to 
grant a waiver of the restrictions contained 
in paragraphs (3)(B) and (C) of the pledge, the 
responsible official may consider the fol-
lowing factors— 
(1) the government’s need for the individ-
ual’s services, including the existence of spe-
cial circumstances related to national secu-
rity, the economy, public health, or the envi-
ronment; 
(2) the uniqueness of the individual’s quali-
fications to meet the government’s needs; 
(3) the scope and nature of the individual’s 
prior lobbying activities, including whether 
such activities were de minimis or rendered 
on behalf of a nonprofit organization; and 
(4) the extent to which the purposes of the 
restriction may be satisfied through other 
limitations on the individual’s services, such 
as those required by paragraph (3)(A) of the 
pledge. 
SEC. 1014. ADMINISTRATION. 
(a) The head of every executive agency 
shall, in consultation with the Director of 
the Office of Government Ethics, establish 
such rules or procedures (conforming as 
nearly as practicable to the agency’s general 
ethics rules and procedures, including those 
relating to designated agency ethics officers) 
as are necessary or appropriate to ensure— 
(1) that every appointee in the agency 
signs the pledge upon assuming the ap-
pointed office or otherwise becoming an ap-
pointee; 
(2) that compliance with paragraph (3) of 
the pledge is addressed in a written ethics

diction to consider the matter. 
(d) In any such civil action, the Attorney 
General is authorized to request any and all

signed by the former employee.

woman from New York. 
b 1345 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, several amend-
ments offered would increase trans-
parency of White House operations and 
personnel. 
The amendment offered by Congress-
man MIKE QUIGLEY would require the 
President to publicly release White 
House visitor logs with certain excep-
tions. 
The amendment offered by Congress-
man DAVID CICILLINE would require the 
White House to publicly release salary 
information and financial disclosure 
statements for White House employees. 
The amendment offered by Congress-
man BILL
PASCRELL
would further 
strengthen the Hatch Act by increasing 
penalties for employees who knowingly 
break the law and use their position for 
partisan 
political 
activity. 
This 
amendment would also allow the Office 
of Special Counsel to continue inves-
tigations into former political employ-
ees after they leave Federal office. 
The amendment offered by Congress-
woman 
ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO-CORTEZ 
would direct the Office of Government 
Ethics to establish ethics requirements 
on the establishment or use of legal ex-
pense funds for the President, Vice 
President, or any political appointee. 
The amendment offered by Congress-
man GERRY CONNOLLY would protect 
the civil service by preventing any po-
sition in the Federal competitive serv-
ice from being reclassified outside of 
merit system principles. Employment 
in the Federal workforce should be 
based on an individual’s knowledge, 
skills, and abilities, not political con-
nections. 
This package of amendments will 
bring accountability and transparency 
to our government. These reforms are 
critical for preserving and strength-
ening our democratic institutions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this package of amend-
ments, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the amendments en bloc. 
This protecting the swamp act is full 
of bad policy and disregards regular 
order. H.R. 5314 is designed purely for 
Democrats to talk about all of their 
failed conspiracy theories about the 
former President. In fact, this bill 
looks more like a fundraising cam-
paign than an effort to provide legisla-
tive solutions. 
My Democratic colleagues should be 
working with Republicans to address 
and solve the problems President Biden 
and his administration have created for 
the American people, not pushing 
through hyperpartisan legislation. 
While this en bloc package of amend-
ments has several legitimate, good 
ideas, there are too many that make 
this bad bill worse. While common-
sense proposals such as strengthening 
minority rights for Oversight and Re-
form Committee members, Freedom of 
Information Act reform, and an inspec-
tor general for the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget are perfectly reason-
able solutions for the House to con-
sider, most of the amendments in this 
bloc make a very bad bill much worse. 
Overall, these amendments entrench 
and slow down the Federal bureauc-
racy, intrude on the executive branch’s 
powers, and strip a duly elected Presi-
dent of the ability to effectively man-
age the executive branch. 
I am not sure if Democrats’ distrust 
of the executive branch is because of 
their hatred for the former President 
or their lack of faith in the current 
President. Either way, Republicans 
should not support attempts to degrade 
the Office of the President. 
The few good amendments in this 
bloc proposed by Republicans are sim-
ply drowned out by bad policy. If 
Democrats were serious about engaging 
with Republicans, then they should 
have worked with us through the nor-
mal legislative process during which 
we could have effectively vetted these 
measures in the committees of juris-
diction. 
Americans are struggling with the 
highest inflation in 30 years, worried 
about the safety of their communities, 
and eager to get their children back to 
school. The majority is flatly ignoring 
the American people to instead talk 
about former President Trump. These 
amendments offered by Democrats in 
this package only move this bill fur-
ther away from addressing the imme-
diate concerns of Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the gentleman from the great 
State of California (Mr. CORREA), who 
is the distinguished chairman of the 
Committee on Homeland Security Sub-
committee on Oversight, Management, 
and Accountability. 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman MALONEY
for 
yielding me time. 
My first amendment, No. 9, will 
strengthen the ability of Congress to 
do our job of oversight of the executive 
branch. It closes a loophole in the 
Freedom of Information Act that effec-
tively lets Federal agencies ignore con-
gressional requests for information. 
Amendment No. 10 will require all 
congressionally mandated reports to be 
transmitted to Congress in a machine- 
readable format. It is a commonsense 
way to search and find information 
within thousands of pages of reports. 
These two amendments are about the 
government, and they are about trans-
parency. Our government should not 
have anything to hide. Both of these 
are supported by the Project On Gov-
ernment Oversight. 
Madam Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote on en bloc No. 1 and to support 
amendments No. 9 and No. 10. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), who is the 
ranking member of the Education and 
Labor Committee. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for yielding time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
my two amendments in this en bloc 
package. 
The alleged purpose of this bill is to

abuses of Presidential power, restoring 
checks and balances and account-
ability and transparency in govern-
ment.’’ 
My amendments, in fact, do exactly 
that and would create an office of in-
spector general, IG, at the Office of 
Management and Budget, OMB. 
Pursuant to the Inspector General 
Act of 1978, this independent, non-
partisan inspector general would pre-
vent and detect waste, fraud, and abuse 
at OMB. 
The underlying bill is a Democrat at-
tempt to relitigate yesterday’s issues. 
But today, Americans are being as-
sailed from all sides. They are facing a 
Democrat President on a spending 
binge that is tearing this country 
apart. Inflation sits at a 30-year high. 
Gas prices are skyrocketing out of con-
trol, and now an even more reckless so-
cialist and amnesty agenda is in the 
works. 
My two amendments will truly bring 
accountability and transparency to the 
executive branch and protect the statu-
tory authorities of Congress. 
Last week, news broke that 40 per-
cent or more of the $700 billion spent 
on unemployment benefits for COVID– 
19 relief went to fraud. That is nearly 
the size of the defense budget. An IG at 
OMB would be able to root out this 
kind of fraud, waste, and abuse and 
save taxpayers’ dollars. The Biden ad-
ministration should welcome having an 
OMB inspector general with the same 
enthusiasm they talk about trans-
parency and accountability. 
My second amendment will help pro-
tect the rights of the minority and 
allow the Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee to easily acquire documents 
from the executive branch so that we 
can uphold true oversight. 
I look forward to working with the 
majority to obtain the information re-
quired by law from the administration 
pursuant to these Rule of 7 requests. I 
appreciate that Democrats agree on 
some level that we need rigorous over-
sight of the executive branch. 
My only question is: Where have they 
been for the last 11 months? 
I am also profoundly disappointed 
that Democrats chose to load up this 
en bloc package with amendments that 
entrench bureaucracy, hamstring Pres-
idential 
appointments, 
and 
micro-
manage Presidential powers. This bill 
is supposed to restore transparency and 
accountability, 
but 
many 
of 
the 
amendments in this package move it in 
the opposite direction. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the gentleman from the great 
State of Tennessee (Mr. COHEN), who is 
the distinguished chair of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary Subcommittee 
on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and 
Civil Liberties. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding me the 
time. 
Madam Speaker, my subcommittee 
works on issues concerning civil rights 
and civil liberties, and we have had 
hearings on the pardon power. The par-
don power is something I have been in-
terested in since the 1970s when a 
Democratic 
Governor 
of 
Tennessee 
abused the pardon power, and I stood 
up against him. I have stood up against 
this previous President, Trump, who 
abused the pardon power even more. He 
gave pardons to his family, to people 
who were administration officials, to 
people who worked on his campaign, 
and to people who lied to the Justice 
Department and to the FBI because 
they were protecting the President 
from the impeachment articles that 
were lodged against him and which 
would have shown his contravention of 
the Constitution. 
I have listened to the debate here 
some. It is astonishing to me. There is 
nothing more important in this govern-
ment and this Congress than pro-
tecting democracy, and democracy was 
threatened by Donald Trump. This bill, 
which ADAM SCHIFF has sponsored with 
many cosponsors, protects democracy. 
It puts checks and balances on the 
President. 
No person should have unfettered 
power, and the President tried to use 
the pardon power to take care of people 
who took care of him, to shut them up 
so they wouldn’t testify against him: 
Roger Stone, Mike Flynn, you name it, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
down 
to 
Paul 
Manafort. 
He pardoned people who lied, who 
grifted, who dealt with the Russians 
and who were part of the conspiracy to 
take over the election by commu-
nicating with Kilimnik and getting in-
formation out there in the social media 
to beat Hillary Clinton and elect Don-
ald Trump, the most disgusting Presi-
dency in the history of this country. 
That is why this bill is so important, 
to protect our democracy and save us 
from abuses by a future President who 
doesn’t have limitations on him. 
Madam Speaker, I pledge allegiance 
to the flag and hope all of us do. I sup-
port this bill. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, they say 
this bill is not about President Trump, 
but every speaker mentioned President 
Trump multiple times. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. C. 
SCOTT FRANKLIN). 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
COMER for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to this legislation and the en bloc 
package, particularly amendment No. 
29. This amendment would continue 
Democratic attempts to federalize elec-
tions. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle like to call us Republicans 
seditionists, yet here they are again at-
tempting to violate the Constitution 
and our democratic republic by inject-
ing the Federal Government into State 
elections. 
I would like to remind the Democrats 
that Article I, Section 4 of the Con-
stitution reads: ‘‘The times, places, and 
manner of holding elections for Sen-
ators and Representatives shall be pre-
scribed in each State by the legislature 
thereof’’—not by Congress. 
Our country is struggling with out- 
of-control 
inflation, 
supply 
chain 
shortages, rampant crime, and a crisis 
on our southern border. Yet, Demo-
crats are focused on violating the Con-
stitution for their own political gain. 
When H.R. 1 was passed earlier this 
Congress, we had assumed that the 
Democrats were done trying to take 
election powers away from the States. 
As it turns out, they were just getting 
started. 
Mr. Speaker, at what point are we 
going to start focusing on the real 
issues facing this country? At what 
point are the Democrats going to real-
ize that America doesn’t want out-of- 
control spending, open borders, and 
rampant crime? 
The Founding Fathers were clear 
that the States are the primary man-
agers of elections. We must address the 
real problems facing the American peo-
ple and stop stripping States of their 
constitutional authorities. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from the great 
State of North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS). 
Dr. ALMA ADAMS is the distinguished 
chairwoman of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor Subcommittee on 
Workforce Protections. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my amendment to ensure trans-
parency in our elections. 
The American people have a right to 
know whether a candidate for Presi-
dent or Vice President has unethical 
foreign 
entanglements 
or 
compro-
mising debts that can be leveraged 
against their administration—or worse. 
My amendment requires the Federal 
Election Commission, FEC, to make an 
income tax return publicly available 
within 48 hours after receipt of return. 
In cases where a return requires exten-
sive redactions, the Federal Election 
Commission may make the return 
available after 48 hours but no later 
than 30 days after receipt of return. 
Only a full release of tax returns can 
ensure that our President and Vice 
President are working for us, the 
American people, not anybody else. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment and 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 5314. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
balance of my time to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN), who is the 
ranking member of the House Judici-
ary Committee. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, Americans want safer 
streets, affordable gas, and freedom. In-
stead, Democrats give us record crime 
levels, record inflation, and another

bill attacking President Trump spon-
sored by the guy who spent years mis-
leading the Congress and, more impor-
tantly, the country on the Trump-Rus-
sia investigation, on the Mueller inves-
tigation, and on impeachments. 
b 1400 
Remember when the sponsor of the 
bill said that his office didn’t meet 
with the whistleblower? Found out 
that wasn’t true. 
Remember when the sponsor of the 
bill told us that we would hear from 
the 
whistleblower 
during 
impeach-
ment; we would actually have real 
process instead of having hearings and 
depositions in the basement in the 
bunker of the Capitol? 
Remember when the sponsor told us 
this: There was more than circumstan-
tial evidence that President Trump 
colluded with Russia? That turned out 
to be false. Bob Mueller said it was 
false. Everyone knew it was false. 
In fact, it was such baloney, even The 
Washington Post has had to retract 
and change things from stories because 
they said, oh, yeah, yeah, there was a 
lot of false information in that dossier 
that they used to go spy on President 
Trump’s campaign. 
And I think this is important to un-
derstand. The sponsor of this legisla-
tion wasn’t just any Member of Con-
gress, Mr. Speaker. He wasn’t just any 
chairman of a committee in Congress. 
He was the chairman of the Intel-
ligence 
Committee, 
the 
committee 
that gets additional information from 
anyone else in the country, making 
those claims that were not accurate. 
So maybe, instead of having another 
bill that attacks President Trump be-
cause Democrats are afraid he is going 
to run and he is going to win in 2024, so 
they want to do everything they can to 
attack him—maybe instead of another 
bill attacking President Trump, we 
should actually focus on things that 
the American people care about. 
You know, you can attack President 
Trump all you want. I know one thing: 
A year ago, the border was secure. It 
sure was. A year ago, cities were safe, 
safer than they are today. A year ago, 
we didn’t have a 31-year high inflation. 
We actually had wages going up, real 
wages. A year ago, we didn’t have a De-
partment of Justice, attacking moms 
and dads, putting a label, a designa-
tion, a threat tag on parents who sim-
ply go to school board meetings and 
speak out against a racist, hate-Amer-
ica curriculum. No, we didn’t have that 
a year ago. 
But you guys can keep attacking the 
President all you want; not addressing 
the issues that the American people 
care about. We are going to speak 
about the issues they care about. We 
are going to try to do everything we 
can to slow down your crazy agenda 
that is driving up the price of every-
thing. And we are going to speak out 
against and do everything we can to 
make sure the Department of Justice 
quits attacking parents. 
God bless the whistleblower that 
came forward and gave us the informa-
tion sent from the Counterterrorism 
Division of the FBI. We could be deal-
ing with that issue today. We could be 
holding the Attorney General account-
able, the Justice Department account-
able for what they are doing. 
No, no, no. We are going to attack 
President Trump again. Democrats, 
that is the only thing they can do be-
cause they can’t talk about anything 
else. 
I hope we defeat this bill. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from the great 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON), the distinguished vice chair 
of the Committee on House Adminis-
tration. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, if the 
last few years have taught us anything, 
it is that we cannot take our demo-
cratic institutions for granted. And to 
protect them in the future, we must 
codify many of the rules of the road for 
good government which have been 
trampled in recent years by those more 
interested in personal power than the 
public good. 
That is why I rise in support of the 
Protecting Our Democracy Act, which 
would limit future abuses of Presi-
dential powers, strengthen our system 
of checks and balances, and protect 
against foreign interference in our 
elections. 
I am proud to offer my amendment to 
this important piece of legislation 
which would increase the frequency 
with which the inspector general of the 
Department of Justice must report to 
Congress any improper communica-
tions between the Department of Jus-
tice and the White House. 
We all should be concerned about the 
threat it poses to our country when the 
occupant of the White House, whether 
it is Nixon, whether it is Trump, or 
whether it is anyone else, when they 
treat the Department of Justice as 
their own personal law firm, using tax-
payer dollars to advance personal or 
political ambitions, or to block the in-
vestigation of corruption. 
We are learning more every day 
about the heroic public servants in the 
Department of Justice and elsewhere 
who raised their voices to push back 
against 
misconduct 
in 
the 
White 
House. My amendment would make it 
easier for these individuals to alert 
Congress to misconduct and allow us to 
better protect our democracy. 
I urge my colleagues to do their pa-
triotic duty to protect our Constitu-
tion, and to support both my amend-
ment and the underlying bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from the great State 
of California (Ms. PELOSI), the distin-
guished and effective Speaker of the 
House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding, and I 
congratulate her on her great leader-
ship chairing an important committee 
of the House, and thank her for bring-
ing this legislation to the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. ADAM 
SCHIFF for his leadership in putting 
this legislation together, and I will get 
to that in a moment. 
But first, I just want to say how 
proud we are today. Every day that we 
serve in this House, a House of the peo-
ple, is a privilege. No matter what hon-
ors others may bestow on us in this 
House, whether we are Speaker, or 
leader, or whip, or whatever, nothing, 
no honor is greater than to be able to 
step on the floor and say that we speak 
for the people of our district; that they 
have chosen us to come here, as was in-
tended by our Founders. 
Mr. Speaker, 245 years ago, in an act 
of daring that would redefine the 
world, 
our 
Founders—imagine 
the 
courage they had—declared their inde-
pendence from an oppressive monarch. 
They said: ‘‘We hold these truths to be 
self-evident, that all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their 
Creator 
with 
certain 
unalienable 
rights, that among these are life, lib-
erty and the pursuit of happiness.’’ The 
pursuit of happiness was written into 
the founding document. 
And they continued: 
Whenever any form of government be-
comes destructive of these ends, it is the 
people’s duty to throw off such government, 
to provide new guards for their future secu-
rity. 
They were speaking about England. 
Our Founders would then forge those 
guards for our own government, the 
democratic institutions enshrined in 
the Constitution which, for nearly 2-1/ 
2 centuries, have safeguarded the secu-
rity and well-being of the American 
people. 
But, disturbingly, the last adminis-
tration saw our democracy in crisis, 
with a rogue President who trampled 
over the guardrails protecting our Re-
public. 
Now, Congress has the solemn re-
sponsibility and opportunity to safe-
guard our democracy, ensuring that 
past abuses can never be perpetrated 
by any President, of any party. 
The Protecting Our Democracy Act 
ensures the strength and survival of a 
democracy of, by, and for the people, 
defending the rule of law, revitalizing 
our system of checks and balances, and 
restoring our democratic institutions. 
Thank you to Chairman ADAM SCHIFF 
and the chairs of the committees of ju-
risdiction, 
Judiciary 
being 
one 
of 
those, the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform, another, and many cosponsors 
for their leadership on this trans-
formative package of democracy re-
forms which will put in place essential 
safeguards to prevent any President 
from abusing the public trust, no mat-
ter what his or her party is. 
This legislative package is sweeping 
and future-focused, looking to the fu-
ture, designed to restate the rule of law 
now and for generations to come.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7608 
December 9, 2021 
Our chairs have crafted a robust re-
forms package that can stand up to and 
prevent attempts to undermine our de-
mocracy including: The abuse of par-
don power, abuse of office for personal 
enrichment, the solicitation of foreign 
assistance in our elections, retaliatory 
attacks on whistleblowers and inspec-
tors general, politicization of the tools 
of justice, and contempt of Congress’ 
oversight powers on behalf of the 
American people, including our lawful 
subpoena power and the power of the 
purse. 
These steps ensure that no one, not 
even a President, is above the law. 
During the Constitutional Conven-
tion, one of our Founders, George 
Mason, asked: ‘‘Shall any man be above 
justice? Above all shall that man be 
above it, who can commit the most ex-
tensive injustice?’’ 
In his great wisdom, George Mason 
knew that the injustice committed by 
the President erodes the rule of law, 
the very notion, the idea of fair justice, 
which is the bedrock of our democracy. 
And if we allow a President to be above 
the law, we surely do so to the peril of 
our Republic. 
Addressing Presidential abuse, there-
fore, goes to the very heart, the very 
survival of our democracy. We are a de-
mocracy; three coequal branches gov-
ernment, each a check and balance on 
the other that cannot be undermined. 
Otherwise, we are a monarchy, and 
that is what we chose not to be. 
Let me close by recalling another 
scene from that Constitutional Conven-
tion. On its final day, as our Constitu-
tion was adopted, Benjamin Franklin 
was greeted by folks as he descended 
the steps from Independence Hall. Peo-
ple know this story. Children in school 
learn it. 
The people asked, what do we have, a 
republic or a monarchy? Benjamin 
Franklin responded, ‘‘A republic, if you 
can keep it.’’ 
This was the vision of our Founders, 
and we are grateful to them for it. This 
is what our men and women in uniform 
defend, freedom, our democracy, and 
we are grateful to them for it. 
This is what we owe our children as 
we go forward, to meet their aspira-
tions to live in the United States of 
America, with liberty and justice for 
all. And we are responsible it. 
May we be worthy of the vision of our 
Founders, the sacrifice of our men and 
women in uniform, and the aspirations 
of our children. 
The Congress—as Article I, the first 
branch of government—will uphold our 
solemn duty to keep our Republic by 
passing the bill, for the people. 
I say this with great appreciation to 
all who worked so hard to put this to-
gether. 
I 
support 
this 
bipartisan 
amendment that is on the floor right 
now, and I thank those who worked to-
gether in a bipartisan way to put that 
forward, and I hope that we can have a 
successful day for the people, again, 
honoring our Founders, our men and 
women in uniform, and for the chil-
dren. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, the amendments 
contained in this package will help en-
sure that the executive branch is ac-
countable to the American people. This 
package includes amendments that 
were offered by both Democrats and 
Republicans. 
These amendments bolster the many 
reforms in the Protecting Our Democ-
racy Act that will protect against fu-
ture abuses by the executive branch. I 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this package of 
amendments, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

TONKO). Pursuant to House Resolution

position that requires a formal nomination

EFFECTIVE

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 838, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. CARO-
LYN B. MALONEY) and the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) each will 
control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
b 1415 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to these amendments. 
Together, these amendments would 
gut the bill and strike everything in 
this important package of reforms. 
The Protecting Our Democracy Act 
would make the government more 
transparent and accountable to the 
American people. 
Provisions in this bill have been sup-
ported by both Democrats and Repub-
licans. For example, my Whistleblower 
Protection Improvement Act in Title 
VII is a bipartisan bill. Many of the re-
forms in this bill stem from efforts by 
prior administrations of both parties to 
enhance executive power. 
Democrats and Republicans in Con-
gress should unite in reasserting con-
gressional authority. 
Representative BURGESS’ amendment 
would strike important reforms in the 
bill which would ensure that Presi-
dents and Vice Presidents can be held 
accountable for criminal conduct just 
like every other American. 
Representative COMER’s amendment 
would strike every section of the bill, 
including reforms to strengthen whis-
tleblower laws that encourage Federal 
employees to report government waste, 
fraud, and abuse. 
The amendment would strike protec-
tions against Federal agencies’ misuse 
of government funds. The amendment 
would strike the provision in the bill 
that would require the President and 
Vice President to disclose their tax re-
turns. 
The sponsor of this amendment, Rep-
resentative COMER, said at the Rules 
Committee recently, just 2 days ago, 
that he supports that very reform. Yet, 
his amendment would remove it from 
the bill. 
These amendments are not a serious 
attempt at addressing the protections 
in this bill. They are simply a mes-
saging tool that will gut the Pro-
tecting Our Democracy Act. 
My colleagues from across the aisle 
continue to claim that this bill is 
about 
punishing 
former 
President 
Trump. But Joe Biden is our President 
now, and these bold, good-government 
reforms will impact his administration 
as well as future Presidents of both 
parties. 
It is not about the past. It is about 
the future and the strengthening of our 
democracy. I strongly urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this package of amendments, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the 
amendments en bloc. 
In this package is my amendment, 
the IG Stability Act, which clearly 
shows where we should be able to come 
together and pass bipartisan inspector 
general reforms. 
Inspectors general play a critical role 
in rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse 
in the Federal Government. They help 
Congress, and especially the House 
Committee on Oversight and Reform, 
in conducting oversight of executive 
branch offices and Federal agencies. 
Yet, just like in every profession, oc-
casionally there have been either poor 
performers or those who have acted 
outside their mandates. With respect 
to poor performers, we had, in my opin-
ion, a very poor performing Election 
Assistance Commission IG, and she re-
signed after we started calling for her 
to do her job. In those situations, the 
President should have the flexibility to 
remove an inspector general. 
The Democrats’ proposal would dra-
matically limit the President’s author-
ity to remove an inspector general for 
dereliction of duty or undermining the 
policies of a duly elected President. 
My amendment mirrors bipartisan 
language in the Senate which requires 
a detailed rationale to be provided to 
Congress prior to the removal of an IG. 
This ensures Congress has adequate 
oversight of the removal of an IG with-
out preventing a President from re-
moving an IG who is undermining 
them. 
Further, my amendment would help 
remedy the ongoing concern about IG 
vacancies, which has been a recurring 
problem in Republican and Democrat 
administrations. My amendment re-
quires the President to notify Congress 
if they fail to fill a vacancy and pro-
vide a written explanation with a tar-
get date for nomination. 
This amendment ensures that the IG 
community is adequately staffed to 
conduct nonpartisan oversight over 
Federal agencies. 
This provision has already passed the 
House this year as part of the bipar-
tisan 
Inspector 
General 
Protection 
Act, H.R. 23. Yet, the Democrats are 
now putting this commonsense, bipar-
tisan amendment in an en bloc de-
signed to fail. Why? They are not inter-
ested in real reform; they are just in-
terested in messaging, messaging cam-
paigns for the 2022 midterm elections, 
which by all accounts aren’t looking 
very bright for my friends across the 
aisle. 
This amendment and Mr. BURGESS’ 
amendment should be accepted, not 
shoved aside. I encourage support of

this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER), the distinguished chair of the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to this en bloc 
amendment, and particularly to the 
Burgess amendment. 
The Burgess amendment would strike 
one of the most important provisions 
in the bill, one that ensures that a sit-
ting President or Vice President can be 
held accountable for their actions, just 
like every other American. 
This provision is necessary in order 
to close a dangerous loophole in the 
law created by DOJ policy, most re-
cently embodied in the legal opinion by 
the Office of Legal Counsel, which 
holds that a President cannot be crimi-
nally prosecuted during his or her term 
in office. 
Under current law, throughout the 
entire period that a President is pre-
sumed by some to be immune from 
prosecution, the statute of limitations 
continues to run on any offenses he or 
she may have committed. Since most 
Federal criminal offenses carry a 5- 
year statute of limitations, a President 
who is not prosecuted while in office 
for a crime he or she may have com-
mitted could end up evading justice al-
together if the statute of limitations 
runs out before their term is over, par-
ticularly if they are elected to a second 
term. 
Allowing complete immunity from 
criminal prosecution merely because of 
the office a person holds would make a 
mockery of the rule of law. It is a 
maxim of our system of justice that no 
man is immune from the law, that no 
man can be a judge in his own case. 
Statutes of limitations are an impor-
tant element of criminal law. As a gen-
eral matter, they provide a necessary 
balance between protecting defendants 
from delay and allowing prosecutors 
adequate 
time 
to 
investigate 
and 
charge cases. But the law has also long 
recognized that certain limited excep-
tions to this general rule are nec-
essary. The case of a sitting President, 
whose prosecution is barred under Jus-
tice 
Department 
policy, 
fits 
com-
fortably among such exceptions. 
It is necessary, therefore, to simply 
pause the statute of limitations to en-
sure that the Presidency is not a get- 
out-of-jail-free 
card. 
We 
must 
not 
strike this essential provision, because 
every person, no matter his or her title 
or office, must be held accountable 
under our laws. 
I urge strong opposition to this 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to mention one 
other thing. We have heard our friends 
across the aisle talk about Donald 
Trump, and they say that former Presi-
dent Trump did nothing wrong. Demo-
crats, by and large, say he did a lot of 
things wrong. But that is irrelevant to 
this debate. 
This bill has nothing to do with 
President Trump any more than the 
post-Watergate reforms had to do with 
Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon’s con-
duct taught us certain lessons, and 
Donald Trump’s conduct taught us cer-
tain lessons. The legislation before us 
is the result of those lessons. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. I yield as much time as he may 
consume to the gentleman. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, those les-
sons are for us to use to protect the fu-
ture. That is what this legislation is 
about, to protect the future from a 
President, of any party, who may vio-
late the law, who may aggrandize 
power. That is what this is about: the 
future, not the past. 
So when I hear our Republican 
friends talk about Donald Trump and 
talk about how he wasn’t convicted, et 
cetera, it is irrelevant. We are talking 
about the future, not the past. For the 
future, it is necessary to pass this bill, 
and for the future, it is necessary to 
defeat this en bloc amendment. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, again, 
they say it is not about Donald Trump, 
but every speaker on that side of the 
aisle spent a significant percentage of 
their 
time 
talking 
about 
Donald 
Trump. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I do in-
tend to speak on my amendment to 
H.R. 5314, but I do have to reference the 
remarks recently made by the Demo-
cratic Speaker of the House on her tes-
timony. 
Look, it is no news flash that Demo-
crats dislike the former President. 
Democrats dislike President Trump. 
The news flash is they really fear the 
former President, and that is what this 
legislation is all about, because their 
fear is so intense and so overreaching 
and so preoccupying in their lives, they 
can think of nothing else. 
I do want to thank my friend from 
Kentucky for including me in this en 
bloc discussion. I think the amend-
ments that Mr. COMER and I are offer-
ing are an important addition to this 
bill, the so-called Protecting Our De-
mocracy Act. 
Title II of this bill extends the stat-
ute of limitations for offenses allegedly 
committed by a sitting President or a 
Vice President for the duration of their 
tenure and any period of time pre-
ceding their tenure in office. While we 
can agree with the title of the section, 
‘‘No President is Above the Law,’’ this 
section further sets our President and 
Vice President apart. 
Under current law, elected officials, 
President and Vice President, may be 
investigated for alleged commissions of 
crimes, and any information can then 
be brought before Congress where Con-
gress can then choose to remove that 
official from office via impeachment. 
We know how facile our Democratic 
majority has been with the tool of im-
peachment in the past 2 years. If im-
peached and removed from office, that 
individual, the President or Vice Presi-
dent, would then be open to prosecu-
tion to the fullest extent of the law, 
well within the statute of limitations, 
just like every other American. 
Additionally, Title II is very likely 
unconstitutional, as the Sixth Amend-
ment’s speedy trial clause protects the 
accused against unreasonable delays 
between an indictment and a trial. Ex-
tending the statute of limitations in 
Title II of this bill would only further 
politicize the Presidency and Vice 
Presidency, further politicize the im-
peachment process, which the Demo-
crats have elevated to a high art, and 
make holders of those offices the tar-
gets of politically motivated investiga-
tions during and after their terms. 
For those reasons, I urge support of 
this amendment and support of Mr. 
COMER’s amendment. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume for closing. 
The underlying bill is about the fu-
ture, the future of our democracy. It is 
about strengthening our democracy. 
These amendments would gut the un-
derlying bill, the Protecting Our De-
mocracy Act. 
I support the bill, because it includes 
reforms, such as curbing the abuse of 
the pardon power, increasing penalties 
for political appointees who violate the 
Hatch 
Act, 
strengthening 
whistle-
blower protections and IG protections, 
and it would require the President and 
Vice President to reveal their taxes, 
among other reforms. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this package of amend-
ments, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 838, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the

the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

ther proceedings on this question are

H7612 
December 9, 2021 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title VIII add 
the following: 
SEC. 814. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OF-
FICE AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. 
(a) AMENDMENT.—Title V of the National 
Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3091 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following 
new section: 
‘‘SEC. 513. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OF-
FICE ANALYSES, EVALUATIONS, AND 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—The Director of National 
Intelligence shall, to the extent consistent 
with due regard for the protection from un-
authorized disclosure of classified informa-
tion 
relating 
to 
sensitive 
intelligence 
sources and methods, ensure that personnel 
of the Government Accountability Office 
designated by the Comptroller General are 
provided with access to all information in 
the possession of an element of the intel-
ligence community that the Comptroller 
General determines is necessary for such per-
sonnel to conduct an analysis, evaluation, or 
investigation of a program or activity of an 
element of the intelligence community that 
is requested by a committee of Congress with 
jurisdiction over such program or activity. 
‘‘(b) 
CONFIDENTIALITY.—(1) 
The 
Comp-
troller General shall maintain the same level 
of confidentiality for information made 
available for an analysis, evaluation, or in-
vestigation referred to in subsection (a) as is 
required of the head of the element of the in-
telligence community from which such infor-
mation is obtained. Officers and employees 
of the Government Accountability Office are 
subject to the same statutory penalties for 
unauthorized disclosure or use of such infor-
mation as officers or employees of the ele-
ment of the intelligence community that 
provided the Comptroller General or officers 
and employees of the Government Account-
ability Office with access to such informa-
tion. 
‘‘(2) The Comptroller General shall estab-
lish procedures to protect from unauthorized 
disclosure all classified and other sensitive 
information furnished to the Comptroller 
General or any representative of the Comp-
troller General for conducting an analysis, 
evaluation, or investigation referred to in 
subsection (a). Such procedures shall be es-
tablished in consultation with the Director 
of National Intelligence and the congres-
sional intelligence committees. 
‘‘(3) Before initiating an analysis, evalua-
tion, or investigation referred to in sub-
section (a), the Comptroller General shall 
provide the Director of National Intelligence 
and the head of each relevant element of the 
intelligence community with the name of 
each officer and employee of the Government 
Accountability Office who has obtained ap-
propriate security clearance and to whom, 
upon proper identification, records and infor-
mation of the element of the intelligence 
community shall be made available in con-
ducting such analysis, evaluation, or inves-
tigation. 
‘‘(4) Any analysis, evaluation, or report 
prepared pursuant to this provision shall be 
unclassified but may include a classified 
annex, which shall be submitted to the con-
gressional intelligence committees and, con-
sistent with the protection of intelligence 
sources and methods, to the requesting com-
mittee with jurisdiction over the program or 
activity that is the subject of the report.’’. 
(b) CLERICAL
AMENDMENT.—The table of 
sections at the beginning of the National Se-
curity Act of 1947 is amended by inserting 
after the item relating to section 512 the fol-
lowing new item: 
‘‘Sec. 513. Government Accountability Office 
analyses, evaluations, and in-
vestigations.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 838, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, 
since its creation in 1921, the Govern-
ment Accountability Office has had the 
purview to conduct oversight of all 
Federal agencies with the goal of re-
ducing waste, fraud, and abuse and 
holding accountable bad actors. 
However, and unfortunately, most of 
our intelligence agencies today are not 
fully cooperative with the GAO, point-
ing to an outdated and vague 1988 De-
partment of Justice opinion. 
My amendment would allow the GAO 
to act as a check on this behavior—not 
creating new powers, but restoring the 
power Congress always intended the 
GAO to have. 
This amendment is welcomed by 
many in the intelligence community 
who want to protect their important 
work and resources from abuse, par-
ticularly after the last Presidency we 
just endured. 
This amendment was drafted in part-
nership with the community, and I am 
proud to have the support of Rep-
resentative ADAM SCHIFF, who serves as 
the chairman of the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence. In 
fact, many of my colleagues have al-
ready taken a stand in support of this 
legislation because, in 2010, the House 
passed a virtually identical amend-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I must say 
that the GAO plays an important role 
in the legislative branch, but with mat-
ters of national security, we must en-
sure protocols are followed to prevent 
unauthorized disclosures of national 
security information. With this amend-
ment, it is unclear whether those pro-
tocols are being met, creating a poten-
tial national security risk. 
Further, the House Intelligence Com-
mittee already has the authority to 
task GAO, when necessary and appro-
priate, to conduct reviews of the intel-
ligence community and to ensure GAO 
receives appropriate information from 
the intelligence community. The House 
Intelligence Committee has done this 
several times in the past, making this 
amendment moot. 
Again, this is why we needed to go 
through regular order on the various 
bills stitched together in the under-
lying bill. The committees need to 
have an opportunity to vet bills, in-
cluding amendments such as these, be-
fore they come to the floor of the 
House. That is how we ensure good 
bills are passed. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY), the chairwoman of the 
House Oversight Committee. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
this amendment and thank the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ) for her leadership in offering 
it. This amendment would clarify the 
Government 
Accountability 
Office’s 
authority to investigate the intel-
ligence community. 
As Congress’ watchdog, GAO helps to 
improve Federal Government perform-
ance and ensure accountability for the 
American people. GAO has the tools 
and expertise to ensure that classified 
information is treated with appropriate 
care and confidentiality. They have 
been doing that for decades. 
For example, as part of its audit 
work, GAO is authorized to examine 
highly sensitive tax return informa-
tion. Strict protocols are followed to 
protect that information while still en-
abling GAO to carry out its important 
legislative and oversight responsibil-
ities. 
This amendment includes important 
safeguards to balance the protection of 
sensitive information with the need for 
oversight of the intelligence commu-
nity. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on this amendment. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SCHIFF), the chairman 
of the House Intelligence Committee. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of Representative OCASIO-COR-
TEZ’s amendment. 
The GAO’s expertise and technical 
capacity are critical to Congress’ over-
sight. This amendment by the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ) gives GAO access to important 
information in the IC’s possession that 
is necessary for the conduct of GAO’s 
responsibilities while also ensuring the 
protection of sensitive sources and 
methods. It strikes the right balance 
between security, transparency, and 
needed oversight. 
It also imposes confidentiality re-
strictions; clarifies that GAO officers 
and employees, like their IC col-
leagues, are subject to penalties for un-
authorized disclosure; and requires the 
Comptroller General to consult with 
the Director of National Intelligence to 
establish protections against such un-
authorized disclosures. 
In sum, the amendment will enhance 
congressional oversight of the IC in a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7613 
December 9, 2021 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, every time 
Chairman SCHIFF rises to speak on a 
bill about intelligence and security and 
holding the President accountable, I 
get excited, hoping that we are going 
to hear about that evidence of collu-
sion and all the other investigations 
that were conducted in this House over 
the past year. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. COMER. I yield to the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Let me ask the gen-
tleman, are you aware, just by way of 
illustration, that the President’s cam-
paign chairman, Paul Manafort, se-
cretly met with an agent of Russian in-
telligence and provided Russian intel-
ligence with internal campaign polling 
data as well as strategic insights about 
their strategy in key battleground 
States? Are you aware of that? 
Mr. COMER. I think everyone is 
aware of every bit of information that 
you all have tried to peddle over the 
past 4 years. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Let me ask you, are you 
aware, while the Trump campaign 
chairman was providing internal poll-
ing data, that Kremlin intelligence was 
leading a clandestine social media 
campaign to elect Donald Trump? Are 
you aware of that? 
Mr. COMER. I think we see every 
day. Facebook just announced that 
Russia was trying to do a Facebook 
campaign in Ukraine, if I remember 
reading that correctly. 
Mr. SCHIFF, would you yield to a 
question from me? 
Mr. SCHIFF. Would you like me to 
go on? 
Mr. COMER. Would you yield to a 
question? 
Mr. SCHIFF. Well, I am asking you. 
You asked me to present you with 
some of the information. 
Mr. COMER. I think it is great. Are 
you aware of President Biden’s son 
Hunter’s art dealings? 
Mr. SCHIFF. If you would like me to 
continue. 
Mr. COMER. Are you aware of the 
President’s son’s dealings in Congo 
with the cobalt mine? Are you aware of 
the dealings in Ukraine? 
Mr. SCHIFF. To get to the gentle-
man’s question, I am aware of Presi-
dent Trump’s son meeting secretly in 
Trump Tower in New York with the 
Russian delegation with the purpose of 
receiving 
dirt 
on 
Hillary 
Clinton, 
which the Russian delegation rep-
resented was part of the Russian Gov-
ernment’s effort to help elect Donald 
Trump in 2016. 
I am aware that Donald Trump, Jr., 
said in response to that Russian offer 
of dirt on Donald Trump’s opponent 
that he would ‘‘love it,’’ suggested the 
best time would be in late summer, and 
had a secret meeting in Trump Tower. 
When asked about that secret meeting, 
both the President and his son lied 
about it. Are you aware of those facts? 
Mr. COMER. I think that everyone 
has seen all the information, again, 
that you all have peddled. I am curious 
if you would like to take a wager on 
which President’s child, which Presi-
dent’s son, at the end of the day, once 
we have the gavel, will be the greatest 
security risk to our Nation, Hunter 
Biden or— 
Mr. SCHIFF. I am happy to continue 
to outline the contacts between the 
Trump campaign and Russia, their so-
licitation of Russian help in the elec-
tion, the former President’s effort to 
coerce Ukraine into helping him cheat 
in the election. I would be happy to go 
chapter and verse if you would like me 
to use your time that way. 
Right now, though, the subject of 
this amendment is to allow the General 
Accountability Office, the GAO, to help 
Congress oversee aspects of the intel-
ligence community, but if you are 
more interested— 
Mr. COMER. I reclaim my time. They 
spent a lot of time, a lot of time, a lot 
of effort, a lot of tax dollars on trying 
to peddle a lot of wrongdoing in the 
previous administration. 
This bill is all about the previous ad-
ministration. Every speaker on their 
side of the aisle has mentioned Donald 
Trump’s name numerous times, every 
speaker. It is time for the majority 
party to focus on governing and get 
over 
their 
obsession 
with 
Donald 
Trump. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, 
overall, the Protecting Our Democracy 
Act will do much to address the weak-
nesses that were exposed in light of the 
last administration and exploited dur-
ing President Trump’s Presidency. 
I am proud to have four other amend-
ments being included today that ad-
dress nepotism, codify the Biden ethics 
pledge, and regulate defense funds as 
well as inaugural committees. I hope 
my colleagues will also see the value in 
protecting our Intelligence Commit-
tees from abuse and vote to include 
this amendment in the POD Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 838, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

ceedings will resume on questions re-
lated to H.R. 5314 previously postponed.

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN HONOR 
OF THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF 
BARBARA-ROSE COLLINS 
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, 
today, my Michigan colleagues and 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus rise in honor of the life and 
service of Congresswoman Barbara- 
Rose Collins. She dedicated her life to 
community and broke countless bar-
riers. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that everyone 
rise for a moment of silence in honor of 
Congresswoman Barbara-Rose Collins.

THE 
CLERK 
TO 
MAKE 
CORRECTIONS 
IN 
EN-
GROSSMENT OF H.R. 5314, PRO-
TECTING OUR DEMOCRACY ACT 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that, in the en-
grossment of H.R. 5314, the Clerk be au-
thorized to correct section numbers, 
punctuation, spelling, and cross-ref-
erences, and to make such other tech-
nical and conforming changes as may 
be necessary to reflect the actions of 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
KAPTUR). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection.

GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, another 
week, another week of gun deaths. 
No matter where you live—Oxford, 
Michigan; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 
or, most recently, in my district, 
Pottstown—no matter where you are— 
a school, a place of worship, or your 
parked car—gun violence hunts down 
far too many innocent Americans and, 
quite frankly, can find any one of us. 
Our inaction on gun safety, ghost 
guns, and gun violence has created a 
tragic version of Groundhog Day. Too 
often we and our children wake up to 
another headline about senseless, need-
less gun violence; one slaughter bleed-
ing into the next.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7618 
December 9, 2021 
Last week, Oxford High School be-
came the 30th school shooting in 2021, 
with four dead and seven injured. Thir-
ty times this year alone. 
These are not isolated incidents. 
They join a long history of our Na-
tion’s failure to have an honest discus-
sion about guns and gun violence. 
Lawmakers have the responsibility 
to legislate and to protect our children 
and our neighbors from gun violence. 
When will we wake up to a new day?

DEMOCRATS’ 
DRUG 
PRICING 
SCHEME JEOPARDIZES FUTURE 
CURES 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, the Fed-
eral Government cannot be given the 
ability to police innovators who create 
lifesaving products. Top-down, govern-
ment-imposed 
drug 
pricing 
would 
eliminate consumer choices, jeopardize 
future cures, and ultimately lead to so-
cialized medicine. 
The United States invents approxi-
mately two-thirds of the world’s new 
medicines. Our system encourages pri-
vate investments which spur innova-
tion. This is something we should be 
proud of and encourage, not curtail. 
But under the Democrats’ radical 
Build Back Better Act, new drugs and 
cures for diseases like cancer and dia-
betes would be reduced. Price controls 
will lead to reduced access for patients 
and will set a dangerous precedent. 
If the Federal Government has the 
authority to dictate the cost of pre-
scription drugs, what else will it decide 
to set prices for? 
f 
COVID–19 VACCINATIONS ARE 
IMPORTANT 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today regarding the ongoing threat 
posed by COVID–19. 
After 22 months of this pandemic, we 
cannot be complacent. In order to pre-
vent further spread of the virus, either 
someone has to die, which I don’t con-
sider a very good alternative, or every-
body else who isn’t vaccinated ought to 
get their vaccines. By doing so, you 
prevent more suffering and death. 
In Ohio, COVID–19 is ripping across 
the State. Our emergency rooms are 
full of patients, and our ICU staffs are 
overworked. 
Ninety-five 
percent 
of 
COVID 
hospitalizations 
are 
among 
unvaccinated individuals—95 percent. 
This is costing our healthcare system 
billions of dollars and wear and tear on 
all of our medical professionals. 
However, only 61 percent of Ohio resi-
dents have received their first dose. 
That means the majority aren’t pulling 
with the crew. 
I urge all of us to think about the 
safety of our family, our friends, and 
our neighbors and do what we must to 
assist the well-being of those who are 
working overtime now for almost 2 
years in our healthcare facilities. They 
are serving on the front lines. 
We all have a duty to be patriotic, 
and that means saving lives, not tak-
ing them, and making sure that you 
get your vaccine. 
f 
HOLIDAY SHOPPING IN LIBERAL 
CITIES 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
this holiday season, most Americans 
are using the conventional shopping 
method. They choose their item in the 
store and pay for it at the checkout. 
However, this year, others are going 
with a different approach: smash and 
grab robberies. Thugs are ambushing 
stores, breaking windows, and destroy-
ing store property, then walking out 
with all the merchandise they can 
carry. Robberies at pharmacies and re-
tail stores are on the rise this year, 
mostly in liberal cities like San Fran-
cisco, Chicago, and New York City. 
There is a clear pattern here. 
Store robberies are up in Democrat- 
run cities that push defund the police 
agendas and refrain from punishing 
criminals in the name of equity. Crimi-
nals in these cities figured out there is 
no consequence for busting up a Gucci 
store and walking out with thousands 
of dollars of merchandise. 
For example, in California, people 
can steal up to $950 worth of merchan-
dise without being charged with a fel-
ony. Many looters in California cities 
who get arrested are quickly released 
because they don’t even have to pay 
bail. 
Unfortunately, many Democrats are 
willingly ignorant of this trend. They 
even attribute the rise in smash-and- 
grab robberies to the coronavirus or 
deny the problem exists at all. They 
keep 
pushing 
their 
antipolice, 
procriminal policies, and it is hard-
working businessowners and employees 
who end up paying the price. 
Madam Speaker, I always remember 
what my parents told me: Let’s not 
close the barn door after the cows have 
already left. 
f 
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES BY CHINA 
(Mr. BOWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, we 
know that about 1.5 million Uyghur 
and Kazakh Muslims have been de-
tained in reeducation camps and that 
products made in the Xinjiang region 
have been made with forced labor—in 
other words, slavery. 
The House considered the Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act, led by 
Chairman MCGOVERN, that would ban 
the import of goods made with forced 
labor and sanction people responsible 
for modern-day slavery. 
This is ethnic cleansing happening 
here. The world cannot look away from 
one of the most egregious and deadly 
incidents 
of 
ongoing 
Islamophobia, 
genocide, and slavery. 
I was proud to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this leg-
islation and hope to ensure that we 
hold China accountable for this egre-
gious human rights abuse. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO MIKE 
SCHERNECK 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
Michael Scherneck’s selfless 18-year 
career with the Southeast Georgia 
Health System. 
After nearly two decades of dedicated 
service to residents of Georgia’s First 
District, Mike will retire early next 
year as CEO of the Southeast Georgia 
Health System. 
In 2003, Mike began his tenure as the 
executive vice president and CFO. In 
2015, he was named president and CEO 
due to his dedication and hard work 
ethic. 
Without Mike’s tireless advocacy, 
the Southeast Georgia Health System 
would not be the top-tier facility it is 
today. 
In a tenure wrought with trials, in-
cluding three hurricanes and a global 
pandemic, Mike’s extraordinary leader-
ship allowed the health system not just 
to survive but to thrive. 
While we know that Mike is looking 
forward to retired life, we are certainly 
sad to see him go. 
Mike is leaving the Southeast Geor-
gia Health System better than he 
found it and decades of future CEOs 
will surely be inspired by his lasting 
legacy.

NICOLE MONTNA VAN VLECK HON-
ORED AS RICE FARMER OF THE 
YEAR 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
am here today to recognize the great 
work of a fellow rice farmer, Nicole 
Montna Van Vleck. She was just 
named the USA Rice Federation’s 2021 
Rice Farmer of the Year. 
She is a third-generation rice farmer 
in northern California and serves as 
president and CEO of her Montna 
Farms in Sutter County. 
At Montna Farms, conservation is a 
priority. America’s rice farmers have a 
longstanding commitment to protect 
and preserve natural resources. 
Not only is she involved with her 
family’s California rice operation, but 
she also makes time for her passion of 
promoting the U.S. rice industry.

She previously served as the chair of 
the USA Rice Farmers board of direc-
tors, where she collaborated with grow-
ers across the country to solve difficult 
policy issues and strengthen the indus-
try. 
Today, U.S. rice farmers produce 
more rice using less land, energy, and 
water than they did just 20 years ago 
while providing critical habitats for 
many, many species. 
With leaders such as Nicole, Amer-
ica’s rice farmers continue to serve as 
leaders in farming by producing a very 
healthy, 
conservation-friendly 
food 
that generates jobs and economic op-
portunity in rural areas. 
Congrats, Nicole, on this great honor. 
f 
SOCIAL SECURITY 2100: A SACRED 
TRUST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
KAPTUR). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LAR-
SON) is recognized for 60 minutes as the 
designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I rise this afternoon to use 
this hour to discuss ‘‘Social Security 
2100: A Sacred Trust,’’ or, as Martin 
Luther King would remind us, the 
fierce urgency of now and Congress’ 
need to act on Social Security. 
Let me start with the fact that So-
cial Security is the Nation’s number 
one insurance program, the number 
one insurance program that some on 
the other side call an entitlement. 
There is nothing further from the 
truth, and this is easily verifiable. All 
you have to do is look at your pay 
stub. It says FICA. FICA stands for 
Federal Insurance Contributions Act. 
Whose contribution? Every citizen in 
the United States who pays into the 
program. 
It is an earned benefit, and one that 
has never missed a payment. It is a 
guarantee, and that is why it is so vi-
tally important to every American cit-
izen. 
Congress has been negligent. It has 
been 50 years since there has been an 
enhancement to the program. It has 
been more than 38 years since there 
was an attempt at solvency. Yet, 38 
years ago, Congress enacted a cut that 
will take place this January. 
The time to act is now. No more pro-
crastination. For all of our C–SPAN 
listeners, make sure that you contact 
your Member of Congress in both 
Houses. 
We are pleased that 200-plus people 
are original cosponsors of the bill. You 
will hear from some of them today. 
We have taken the liberty of pointing 
out to every Member of Congress how 
many people in their district receive 
Social Security benefits and what that 
brings into their district on a monthly 
basis. I assure you, there is no more 
greater economic development plan for 
Members’ districts than what happens 
on a monthly basis to those who need 
it most. 
Let me reiterate again: Social Secu-
rity is the number one antipoverty pro-
gram for the elderly and the number 
one antipoverty program for children 
as well. 
I have here, Madam Speaker, some-
thing we have done for every Member 
of Congress. In this case, we are illus-
trating our great leader, Representa-
tive JIM CLYBURN, who is a proud co-
sponsor of this bill. 
In his district, in South Carolina’s 
Sixth, there are 149,433 Social Security 
recipients who receive $189 million in 
monthly benefits. That is monthly ben-
efits. There are 1.2 million Social Secu-
rity recipients in South Carolina who 
receive $1.7 billion in monthly benefits 
as well. 
For about half of senior beneficiaries, 
Social Security provides a majority of 
their income. Now imagine that, for 
half the seniors in the country, Social 
Security provides a majority of their 
benefits, yet there hasn’t been an en-
hancement or an increase in over 50 
years in a COLA. That doesn’t even 
come remotely close to what people 
need. 
For more than a quarter of our sen-
iors, it provides 90 percent or more of 
their income, 90 percent for a quarter 
of our seniors. At a time when the 
wealth disparity is the greatest it has 
ever been in our country, the wealthi-
est nation in the world, there are 5 mil-
lion of our fellow Americans, mostly 
women, who receive a below-poverty 
level check from their government. 
b 1630 
Why? Because Congress hasn’t acted. 
This isn’t something the President can 
do through executive order, nor is this 
something that the Supreme Court is 
going to adjudicate. This is the respon-
sibility of the United States Congress. 
I am proud that we had a hearing the 
other day in the Ways and Means Com-
mittee that we are going to bring to a 
markup and ultimately to the floor of 
this House: Social Security 2100. I am 
proud of the fact that we have a Presi-
dent of the United States who refers to 
Social Security as a sacred trust, a sa-
cred trust between the government and 
their people. And Social Security has 
never failed. It has never missed a pay-
ment. 
It used to be—and Mr. CARTWRIGHT 
from Pennsylvania knows this—that 
we could go back to 1935 to explain why 
Roosevelt back then, in the midst of 
the Great Depression, put forward So-
cial Security because of the devasta-
tion that had taken place in 1929 dur-
ing the great crash. 
But Members on this floor, Members 
in this Congress understand all too 
well that we only have to go back to 
2008, 2009 during the Great Recession 
when people saw their 401(k) become a 
101(k) where people lost their benefits. 
And that coupled with the great pan-
demic, this roller coaster of a pan-
demic that we are living through now 
has only further underscored the need 
for us to enhance the Nation’s number 
one insurance program. 
And during that same time, during 
that recession that they witnessed 
their funds depleted and devastated or 
lost altogether or during layoffs that 
have occurred through no fault of their 
own, Social Security has never missed 
a payment. Not a pension payment, not 
a spousal payment, not dependent cov-
erage, nor disability. 
Madam Speaker, it might surprise 
some of our viewers and listeners that 
more veterans depend on Social Secu-
rity disability than they do on the VA. 
And it is because Social Security pro-
vides these benefits and especially for 
our veterans. People in this Chamber 
and in the Senate take great pride in 
talking about our veterans on Memo-
rial Day and Veterans Day, and right-
fully so, and saluting them and saying 
what a grateful Nation we are. 
Well, if we are truly a grateful Na-
tion, then it is time we end the more 
than 50 years of neglect and make sure 
that our veterans are able to get the 
benefits that they richly deserve with-
out 5-month delays, in making sure 
that they have disability that they 
know they can rely on, that works for 
the times that we are living through 
currently. 
Children continue to rely on Social 
Security, and it is the number one 
antipoverty program for children. And 
you know what, 10,000 baby boomers a 
day become eligible for Social Secu-
rity, and millennials will need the ben-
efit 
more 
than 
baby 
boomers. 
Millennials have been put in the posi-
tion where they have less money to be 
able to afford private pensions, where 
they have been burdened with college 
loan debt, where they are unable to get 
the kind of mortgages their parents en-
joyed, and, in fact, have incomes that 
are below that level, and so, Social Se-
curity becomes their salvation. But it 
can’t be their salvation if they are 
locked at the bottom, and we are not 
making the benefit increases that will 
provide that opportunity for all gen-
erations to enjoy. 
Madam Speaker, we are pleased also 
that Social Security 2100 will not only 
lift benefits across the board, but it 
will make sure that no one can work 
all their lives, pay into a system and 
retire into poverty. More than 5 mil-
lion Americans get a below-poverty- 
level check from the government after 
having paid in all their lives. That is 
unfair. That is unjust. That is flat out 
wrong. We are a body that can pass out 
trillions of dollars of tax cuts to the 
Nation’s wealthiest 1 percent and yet 
we can’t take care of people who have 
paid into the system because Congress 
has not fulfilled its obligation and re-
sponsibility. 
Now is the time to act, and under 
Democratic leadership, that will take 
place. People say to me often, ‘‘Well, 
what is different?’’ 
What is different is: we have a Demo-
cratic House, a Democratic Senate, and 
most importantly, a President who be-
lieves that this is a sacred trust. A 
President, as MATT CARTWRIGHT also

knows, who has said we are going to 
end WEP and GPO. 
And for you listeners, for you view-
ers, that means for all you school-
teachers, for you firefighters, for you 
police officers, for you municipal em-
ployees that were penalized under a 
system who have worked hard and 
played by the rules, the President has 
called for its repeal, and that means 
benefits flowing to people who right-
fully deserve them and should right-
fully get them. 
I would add that that has had bipar-
tisan support in the Congress, and we 
do have bipartisan support for this bill 
across the Nation. No one yet on the 
other side has signed up, but yet, all 
across the Nation in large numbers 
more than 80 percent of Democrats, 
more than 68 percent of Republicans 
and more than 74 percent of Independ-
ents all favor increasing benefits be-
cause they know of the security and 
the promise and the necessity of Social 
Security. 
I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT) who is an 
original cosponsor, Madam Speaker, of 
this Social Security 2100, as are you, 
who understands how critical this is to 
Pennsylvanians and everyone across 
the Nation. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
thank the gentleman particularly not 
only for authoring and helping out all 
the rest of us cosponsor this important 
legislation, but in particular for men-
tioning the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania here late this afternoon. 
It was Pennsylvania that was instru-
mental in actually passing the Social 
Security Act back in the thirties. It 
was a huge fight. It was a time when 
Republicans called the concept of So-
cial Security, Madam Speaker, com-
munism. They called it that. They said 
it would lead to horrible things. They 
said it would be the ruination of the 
American economy and the American 
democracy, and it was communism. 
That is what the Republicans called 
the whole idea of Social Security when 
the Roosevelt administration came up 
with it. 
And the Roosevelt administration 
was having a huge fight with the Re-
publican-dominated Supreme Court of 
the United States. They were against 
it. And they kept ruling that Roo-
sevelt’s programs, the National Labor 
Relations Act, all of these programs 
that Roosevelt came up with, the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission, all of 
these programs that Roosevelt came up 
with to try to work our way out of the 
Great Depression, the Supreme Court 
was invalidating as unconstitutional 
under the Commerce Clause. 
And it was actually a member of the 
United States Supreme Court, a Repub-
lican member named Owen J. Roberts 
who saved the day, Congressman LAR-
SON. He saved the day because he 
changed his mind about the commerce 
clause and how it applied to the Social 
Security Act. 
Owen J. Roberts was a terrific trial 
lawyer from Philadelphia. He was a 
prosecutor. He was in the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office. And he personally handled 
the Teapot Dome scandal. He pros-
ecuted the criminals who perpetrated 
the Teapot Dome scandal back in the 
twenties. 
And his career flourished. He started 
a law firm where I actually practiced 
for 2 years as a young lawyer myself in 
Philadelphia. And Owen J. Roberts 
went on to join the Supreme Court of 
the United States as an associate jus-
tice, he was one of the Republican 
members. 
There was great controversy about 
whether Social Security would be ruled 
constitutional. Roberts thought about 
it, and to his great and everlasting 
credit and to the credit of the Com-
monwealth 
of 
Pennsylvania, 
he 
changed his mind. He changed his 
mind, and he validated the Social Se-
curity Act. And as a result, it was 
signed into law and it was held con-
stitutional. 
The Social Security Administration 
took off, and all of a sudden, American 
life included this promise, as the gen-
tleman stated, a sacred trust. This 
promise that if you work your whole 
life, you pay into the system, you pay 
your FICA taxes all the way through, 
you continue to pay every quarter all 
the way through your career, that is 
the promise, that when you retire you 
will not be left destitute. You will not 
be relegated to poverty and to priva-
tion, that you will have food on your 
table and a roof over your head because 
you will have money coming in that is 
your money. It is your money. You 
paid into it. It is not the government, 
it is an insurance program, as the gen-
tleman 
from 
Connecticut 
astutely 
noted. And it is a promise that has 
been kept every day, every week, every 
month since the 1930s. We are talking 
about 80 years of keeping a promise for 
Social Security. 
In my district it makes a very big 
difference. The gentleman from Con-
necticut is right. There is an awful lot 
of people who are over the age of re-
tirement who are depending entirely on 
Social Security checks to survive. Yes, 
in some places it is around 25 percent, 
that might be the average. But I can 
tell you that there are places that are 
hurting in this country where the peo-
ple surviving on Social Security checks 
and nothing else coming in approaches 
40 or 50 percent. 
You can see who it is, and you feel 
for them, and you know that every 
year they see what they call the COLA 
increases, the cost-of-living adjust-
ment increases. It is all worked out by 
a mathematical formula. It is called 
CPI, and it is the Consumer Price 
Index, and it rises in accordance with 
what formula is used. 
Over the years, Social Security has 
been attacked by Republicans. It was 
attacked savagely at the outset as 
communism. In the first decade of this 
millennium, the Republicans wanted to 
privatize Social Security, make it so 
that the money went into the stock 
market. 
Now, imagine that, into the stock 
market. 
And then when we had this enormous 
stock market crash in 2008, the retire-
ment savings of all of these people who 
paid into this wonderful insurance pro-
gram for retirement would have been 
wiped out. But it was Democrats who 
fought day in and day out in that time. 
You were there, Mr. LARSON. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. During 
that time, our current Speaker led the 
fight when George Bush said he was 
going to use his political capital that 
they had just gained and were in con-
trol of the House, the Senate, and the 
Presidency, they were going to pri-
vatize Social Security. And it was 
NANCY PELOSI and people like MARCY 
KAPTUR that led the charge in the fight 
that prevented the privatization of So-
cial Security. 
To your point, had that gone into ef-
fect, people’s total savings and every-
thing that is a guarantee under Social 
Security would have been lost in 2008. 
We are beyond 2008 now, but we are 
still dealing with all of those things 
that people can’t necessarily prepare 
for, whether it is a pandemic or wheth-
er it is the Great Recession or whether 
it is the vicissitudes of the stock mar-
ket, as Roosevelt would have said. 
These are the things that people who 
work hard and play by the rules are 
subject to, and that is why this is a sa-
cred trust. Because in the United 
States we will not let that happen to 
our citizens because nobody deserves to 
work all their lives and retire into pov-
erty. 
I thank the gentleman for his leader-
ship in this area. 
b 1645 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. The gentleman is 
exactly correct. It was an attempt to 
privatize Social Security in those 
years. And it was only by the stalwart, 
staunch defense of the Social Security 
system by the Democrats—Democrats 
present here in this Chamber today— 
who did that and fought it off. And 
thank God they did. 
Because it is true, the stock market 
crash of 2000 would have thrown mil-
lions and millions of seniors right into 
poverty if the Republicans had got 
away with it, had privatized Social Se-
curity. 
And it did not stop there. I was not in 
Congress in those years, but I came 
into Congress. I was elected in 2012. 
And in 2013, I was sworn in for the first 
time. And here I am, a freshman Demo-
crat, and about 4 months into my very 
first term, something happened. The 
Republicans were pushing this scheme 
called chained CPI. And chained CPI 
was a $50 expression that means lower 
cost of living adjustment increases, 
lower increases year after year. 
The idea was, well, we have to make 
ends meet at Social Security so let’s 
cut increases for seniors. That was

their 
plan. 
And 
they 
called 
that 
chained CPI. 
Now, there was a big fight over that, 
of course. And at least at that point, 
the Republicans weren’t calling Social 
Security communism, but they were 
still trying to cut it for seniors, and 
that is no good. And the Democrats 
fought back hard against that. 
Well, along comes 2013, and in the 
springtime, the President comes out 
with a budget. And President Obama at 
the time, he wanted to extend an olive 
branch to the Republicans, it might be 
recalled. And President Obama incor-
porated this chained CPI notion in his 
budget. He put that in his budget. 
I wasn’t having it. I joined a bunch of 
people—I think the congressman from 
Connecticut was with me—and we went 
out on the lawn of the Capitol to pro-
test against the President of the 
United States, a Democratic President 
of the United States extending this 
olive branch to the Republicans by put-
ting chained CPI in his budget. We 
were protesting. We Democrats were 
protesting against a Democratic Presi-
dent going along with that notion just 
to try to get along with the Repub-
licans. 
In the end, to his everlasting credit, 
President Obama withdrew that offer 
and never brought it up again. And 
now, under Social Security 2100, there 
is a real cost of living adjustment for-
mula in there, something that actually 
takes into account the things that sen-
iors has to buy; the things that seniors 
can’t afford unless they get the in-
crease; the things that seniors need to 
live in any kind of reasonable style of 
living. There is a reasonable cost of liv-
ing adjustment in Social Security 2100, 
and I am proud to be on that bill. 
Look, workers paid into this fund all 
their careers; it is their money. And 
the promise is not that you will get 
some money, the promise is that you 
are going to get enough money to 
make it out of poverty in your retire-
ment. And if you have other things 
coming in, fine, but there are people 
who rely entirely—that is their sole 
source of support—the Social Security 
checks that they get. 
Madam Speaker, in my district, 
140,000 people, relying on those Social 
Security checks coming in. And my 
suggestion this evening, as we talk 
about Social Security 2100, let’s pass it 
and keep the promise. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania for joining us this after-
noon. 
Madam Speaker, I would point out a 
couple of things, something the gen-
tleman 
knows—and 
we 
have 
been 
joined by the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois, who will address us shortly—but 
the number of groups that are endors-
ing Social Security 2100: 
The National Committee to Preserve 
Social Security and Medicare, Social 
Security Works, the Alliance for Re-
tired Americans, the Paralyzed Vet-
erans of America, the NAACP, the Na-
tional 
Organization 
for 
Women, 
Latinos for Secure Retirement, the Na-
tional Education Association, AFGE, 
the American Federation of Teachers, 
The Arc of the United States, National 
Retiree Legislative Network, the Gray 
Panthers, American Family Voices, 
The Senior Citizens League. And the 
list goes on and on and on, because ev-
erybody understands the importance 
and significance of this. 
Madam Speaker, I recognize the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Illinois, 
who 
has 
worked tirelessly on behalf of seniors 
across this country, and has headed a 
task force for more than a decade now 
that was instrumental in providing us 
with all the detailed information with 
the over 17 proposals that are included 
in Social Security 2100, a sacred trust. 
Madam Speaker, we make this point 
often, and I want to make it here to-
night, because you are well-aware of 
this as well. That in legislative par-
lance, the bill is called H.R. 5723. But 
what I want our viewers, our listeners, 
and most importantly, our colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle to under-
stand, this is about your parents. This 
is about your brothers and sisters, your 
aunts and uncles. This is about your 
next-door neighbor, your coworker, the 
people that you worship with. 
This is not legislative parlance, this 
is the reality that they are living; and 
the disparity that exists today, the gap 
that exists, can be closed if Congress 
does a job that it has neglected for 
more than 50 years in terms of enhanc-
ing a program that is a necessity for 
your parents, for your brothers and sis-
ters, for your aunts and uncles. All you 
have to do is ask them. It confounds 
me that anyone can look their con-
stituents in the eye and say that we 
are doing enough for you, or that you 
are okay. 
We all know, and I have heard Jan 
say this many times—I know my moth-
er said it—she says, Oh, I just care that 
my children are okay, and I just don’t 
want to be a burden. Of course people 
feel that way. It is their humility and 
their kind of generation and people 
that we know. Nobody wants to be a 
burden. But I assured my mother she 
was no burden. She was an inspiration. 
And for us to stand by in the midst of 
this, the wealthiest Nation in the 
world, and not do our responsibility as 
a Congress and vote. 
The President can’t do it by execu-
tive order, nor will the Supreme Court 
adjudicate it. It is only Congress. And 
thanks to the efforts of JAN
SCHA-
KOWSKY, we are getting there. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my brother for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, JOHN LARSON and I 
came into the Congress together, elect-
ed in 1998 to be here. But I want you to 
know, JOHN, that I have been working 
on issues of Social Security since the 
1970s—well before I was eligible for So-
cial Security. 
When I was an organizer in Chicago, 
one of my first organizing efforts was 
to help establish Metro Seniors in Ac-
tion, an organization in the city of Chi-
cago of older Americans. I will tell you 
what, JOHN, I learned a lot from them. 
One of them was courage to stand up to 
power, to not be afraid of the old 
Mayor Daley in Chicago, not to be 
afraid of anyone, to stand up for rights. 
One of those priorities then, as well, 
was making sure that Social Security 
was solid. 
Now that you have talked about the 
Alliance for Retired Americans, I was 
the executive director of the chapter of 
that in the State of Illinois throughout 
most of the 1980s until I ran for the leg-
islature in 1990. And again, we were 
fighting—I remember well—to protect 
Social Security. 
Well, guess what? Now, we are not 
just talking about protecting Social 
Security, but we did have a battle 
when George W. Bush decided that he 
thought privatizing Social Security 
was a good idea. Well, all over the 
country we organized, seniors orga-
nized, the Democrats organized, to 
make sure that privatizing Social Se-
curity, which would have jeopardized 
the security of that benefit—and actu-
ally, let me correct that for a minute. 
You know, many people call Social 
Security an entitlement. This is some-
thing that people in every paycheck 
that they have had is paid for. This is 
a program that is paid for out of the 
pocket of workers and has to be there 
when they retire. This is not some sort 
of a gift from the American people. 
This is something that has been earned 
by the American people. 
But we won that battle with George 
W. Bush because that was not the di-
rection that the majority of Ameri-
cans—Democrats, Republicans, rural, 
urban—wanted. They wanted to make 
sure that Social Security was reliably 
there. But it was always to protect So-
cial Security. And now, thank you, 
JOHN LARSON, because now we are talk-
ing about improving Social Security 
benefits. And isn’t it about time? 
Right now, the majority of Ameri-
cans get more than half of their income 
from Social Security. When Franklin 
D. Roosevelt first talked about Social 
Security, it was thought of as a three- 
legged stool. 
Did you talk about that already? 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. No. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Okay. So the 
first was people’s savings. You know 
what? There is hardly any savings any-
more for the elderly. And actually, for 
most Americans, hardly have any 
money, unfortunately, that has been 
put away, because average wages, com-
pared to the wealthiest people, have 
gone down. 
The second was pensions. Remember 
that? There were pensions. People 
would have that guaranteed retirement 
benefit from the work. Those are large-
ly gone. And then, Social Security to 
help along. Well, now it is mostly 
about Social Security. More than half

of Americans rely on Social Security 
for more than half of their income. And 
a quarter of seniors now rely on Social 
Security for 90 percent or more of their 
income. You need Social Security to 
survive. 
But let’s talk about what survival is. 
The average monthly Social Security 
check is $1,543 per month. Who can live 
on that? I mean, it is really a struggle, 
at the very best, to be able to even 
make it. That is it—$1,543 a month. 
So the gentleman’s legislation is so 
incredibly important. And you talked 
about grandparents. Well, you know, 
plenty of us in the Congress now are 
also Social Security-eligible. And those 
who are not, are thinking about their 
parents and loved ones. But I also want 
to point out that two of my grand-
children benefited from Social Security 
because, sadly, their mother had died. 
And so they were eligible for benefits 
that helped them to be able to continue 
with their education. 
So it is a family plan. Social Secu-
rity is a necessity. And for a long time 
we 
have 
also 
been 
talking 
about 
women, particularly women, people 
who have left the workforce to become 
caregivers. But there has been no help 
for them, even though they haven’t 
been able to pay into Social Security. 
b 1700 
I now understand that there will be a 
provision for a caregiver credit? 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Cor-
rect. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank so much; 
for people who have taken time out of 
the workplace. Many of us have heard 
from 
public 
employees, 
including 
school teachers, who have lost Social 
Security benefits due to the so-called 
windfall elimination provision that has 
meant unfairly that they have lost So-
cial Security benefits. 
Finally, after years and years and 
years of fighting, that unfairness will 
be gone because of your legislation. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, this has been bipartisan. 
Chairman NEAL, a Social Security re-
cipient himself lost his father, lost his 
mother, his grandmother was then 
raising him, and then he lost his grand-
mother. 
TOM REED, the ranking member on 
the Social Security Subcommittee, and 
TOM RICE, they both lost parents and 
were raised on Social Security as well. 
Mr. DAVIS has put a bill in and has 
sponsored a bill for a number of years 
to eliminate the windfall elimination 
provision. 
Finally, President Biden said we are 
going to repeal this in its entirety. It 
shows that there is an ability, a bridge 
to come together in so many of these 
things, including caregiver opportuni-
ties, that are bipartisanly-sponsored 
within this bill and included as part of 
the bill. 
We have yet to have anyone endorse 
and support the bill, but that is a mat-
ter, I think, of voting and getting be-
yond what happens in this Chamber 
and in discussions between here and 
the Senate is that there is an awful lot 
of talk about helping veterans, but no-
body actually votes one way or the 
other. There is an awful lot of talk 
about understanding what we have to 
do, but then nobody votes. 
The time for reckoning, this is a 
point President Biden makes all the 
time, and I know, Madam Speaker, you 
understand this as well. Our very de-
mocracy and our Republic is at stake 
here because government, in an entre-
preneurial 
capitalistic 
system 
like 
ours, where there has to be, by the na-
ture of the system, risk that is taken. 
Well, that is important and good, but 
by the same token, Roosevelt and sub-
sequent Presidents, including Eisen-
hower, including Nixon, and including 
Reagan, recognized this. We need that 
safety net there for people who work 
hard and play by the rules. 
President Biden has said, yes, this is 
a sacred trust. Martin Luther King 
came to Washington, D.C. in 1963 dur-
ing the famous march, and gave us the 
phrase, ‘‘the fierce urgency of now.’’ He 
was talking at the time about segrega-
tion and about the need for voting 
rights. 
But the fierce urgency of now applies 
to all of our citizens that have been ad-
dressed in the remarks, who need this 
and who are suffering and receiving 
below poverty level payments from 
their own government after they have 
paid in. This is at a time when we gave 
the Nation’s wealthiest 1 percent an 83 
percent tax cut. God bless them. 
It hasn’t trickled down to everybody 
else. That is why we have the system 
that we do to take care of. It is the 
government’s responsibility. And if a 
democracy is going to work, if we are 
not listening to what, as all the polls 
say, and we have accompanied more 
than six different polls talking about 
where the America people are, this is 
not partisan. This is totally bipartisan 
in terms of people’s understanding of 
what their needs, their belief in a sys-
tem they know that has never failed 
for them. 
Dr. Martin Luther King said: Now is 
the time to make real the promise of 
democracy. Now is the time to make 
good on the promise of the Federal 
Government. That is what Joe Biden 
has said and what he so eloquently has 
called a sacred trust. Now is the time 
for us. 
This is beyond urgent, though it is 
the fierce urgency of now. It is shame-
ful that this body, the world looks in 
on this great Nation, this great democ-
racy that we have, it looks how we 
treat our people; how we treat our vet-
erans; how we treat our children. The 
statistics that you rallied off about 
what is going on in this country and 
how they are depending on it, and then 
realizing that Congress hasn’t done a 
thing in 50 years? 
This is not anything that can be 
done—and I repeat this again—by exec-
utive order or by adjudication from the 
Supreme Court. This is the responsi-
bility of every man and woman in this 
Chamber, of 535 of us overall, but it is 
our responsibility and the time to vote 
is long overdue. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
let me just close with this. We are 
going to hear, oh, well, you know, too 
much money. We can’t afford to in-
crease the benefits. I think it is impor-
tant to remind people that Social Secu-
rity was born during the greatest de-
pression that this country had ever 
seen. 
It was from the understanding of the 
President at that time, President Roo-
sevelt, who understood that we cannot 
have poorhouses for older Americans. 
That this country, if we can’t afford to 
do that, then we cannot call ourselves 
a real democracy, a country that really 
cares for people. 
At this point we are the richest coun-
try in the world; the richest country 
ever on the planet. Now is the time 
when we need to do this. There is abso-
lutely no excuse. You have said about 
the urgency of now. This is a moment 
of opportunity, and we should not 
make the mistake of overlooking it. 
We have got everything in place. We 
have got your bill. We have got a Presi-
dent. It is time now to engage everyone 
in this country to say yes. Let’s make 
improvements to one of the greatest 
things that ever happened in the 
United States, the greatest treasures 
that we have, and that is Social Secu-
rity. 
Let’s make it even better. God bless 
you for leading the way on this. I am so 
proud to be helpful in any way that I 
can to be a partner with you. We can 
do this. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, we can do this. I think Martin 
Luther King coined a phrase as well, 
and I am paraphrasing here: This is not 
the time for the tranquilizing drug of 
gradualism. This is not the time in the 
face of so much inequality and in-
equity. That is when problems happen 
in society, when the people see that 
their government has not lived up to 
its responsibility. 
As noted, they pay into the system 
weekly, biweekly, or monthly. Our 
good colleague and friend, John Lewis, 
said: This is not only an important 
issue in terms of our people, this is a 
civil rights issue. He said and believed 
that with every fiber in his being be-
cause what he saw is the people that 
were discriminated against were the 
low wage earners. 
Unfortunately, as you know and have 
spoken eloquently on, most of them are 
women, and specifically, women of 
color. So whether you had a job as a 
waitress or a seamstress or whether 
you were one of those caregivers that 
everybody relies on, or whether you 
had to go home to provide care for your 
family and you didn’t pay into a sys-
tem, or your wage level, long before 
pay equity, was far lower than your 
male counterpart, this is not a reason

you should live out your remaining 
days in poverty. This happens for 5 mil-
lion Americans. 
In a blink of an eye we can do a tax 
cut. In a blink of an eye we can pass a 
defense bill. I support both. But I fer-
vently support the fact that we have to 
take care of our citizens. It is this 
body’s responsibility, Congress’ respon-
sibility. We cannot walk away. 
Every citizen in this country ought 
to make sure that they are holding 
their congressional delegations respon-
sible for doing their job. This is noth-
ing that should be kicked down the 
road again or put off to some gradual 
dealing with the subject matter, or yet, 
another study that we are going to try 
to look into this on. 
We don’t need to study this. We know 
what the issue is here. We have looked 
in the mirror, and the problem is the 
United States Congress, it is the body 
that votes and changes the policy and 
the direction. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for joining us. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the subject of our Special 
Order today, Social Security 2100, a 
Special Trust. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank as well Presi-
dent Biden for having the temerity to 
not only on the campaign trail, but to 
speak directly to the American people 
and let them, and ensure them, that we 
understand that this is a sacred trust, 
a bond that will not be broken. Not on 
our watch. That we will fulfill that 
promise and make sure that they are 
receiving the kind of benefits that they 
have paid into a system for and are, 
yes, entitled to receive because there is 
no greater Nation in the world than the 
United States of America. 
When this body sets its mind to it, as 
witnessed how bipartisan the public 
feels about this on the outside and a 
number of the great inclusions that 
both Democrats and Republicans feel 
about, now is the time for us to act on 
behalf of the citizens we are sworn to 
serve. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

REFLECTING ON AND HONORING 
THE ACTIONS AND ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS 
OF 
THE 
HONORABLE 
ROBERT J. DOLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Kan-
sas (Mr. ESTES) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent for all Members to 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include any ex-
traneous material on the subject of 
this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kansas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, tonight 
lying in state in the rotunda of this 
Capitol Building is Robert Joseph Dole. 
Bob Dole was an American statesman, 
a former Member of this House of Rep-
resentatives, a former U.S. Senator, a 
World War II veteran, a tireless fighter 
for what is right, and, last but not 
least, a Kansan. 
Tonight, we want to reflect on and 
honor the actions and accomplish-
ments of this great American hero. 
Today, I am here with my colleagues 
from the Sunflower State and other 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives to honor Robert Joseph Dole, one 
of the finest Americans to ever serve in 
this institution. 
Bob Dole has a record of devotion and 
service to this country—a World War II 
hero, the majority leader of the Sen-
ate, and a Republican nominee for 
President. But to truly understand the 
man Bob was, Madam Speaker, you 
have to know a bit about where he was 
from because out of all the things Bob 
did and accomplished through his long 
life, I know that Bob always epito-
mized what it meant to be a son of 
Kansas. 
Our State is situated in the very 
heart of our great Nation, more than 
1,000 miles west of Washington. It is 
imbibed with a strong sense of freedom 
and with great compassion for our fel-
low man. The vivid sunsets of amber 
waves of grain are a constant reminder 
of the beauty and grace that only come 
from a loving God. And our climate, 
which can include some of the harshest 
winters or cloudless summers, produces 
hardy 
people 
who 
are 
resolute, 
undeterred, and quick to adapt to any 
challenges they may face. 
It is from Kansas where Bob Dole 
first entered the world in the summer 
of 1923. 
A natural athlete, he was recruited 
by famed basketball coach Phog Allen 
and was a Jayhawk basketball player 
and football player, and he ran track at 
the University of Kansas. But the 
grave threats against our freedom and 
our Nation called Bob away from his 
studies at KU and placed him in battle 
overseas during World War II. 
His enlistment in the United States 
Army would take him far from the flat 
plains of Kansas to another continent, 
and he returned to the shores of Amer-
ica with two Purple Hearts, a Bronze 
Star, and scars of war. 
Permanent damage would restrict 
him to a hospital for more than a year 
and limit the mobility in his right arm 
for the rest of his life. Bob Dole’s serv-
ice to our country during World War II 
is more than most of us will ever give 
back to the country in our entire life-
time. 
But Bob wasn’t done yet. After re-
turning 
to 
school, 
this 
time 
at 
Washburn University in Topeka, he 
served in the Kansas House of Rep-
resentatives and then as Russell Coun-
ty attorney. 
In 1961, Bob Dole brought his grit, op-
timism, and wit to the Chamber we are 
standing in today, having been elected 
by Kansans of the Sixth District, and 
then again by the First District after 
redistricting. He represented Kansas in 
the people’s House for 8 years before 
the entire Sunflower State sent him 
across the Capitol to the Senate. His 
passion for the United States, ability 
to bring colleagues together, and sense 
of humor elevated him to lead the Re-
publican Party. 
But Dole would also seek to serve the 
American people from 1600 Pennsyl-
vania Avenue. He was the running 
mate to President Gerald Ford and 
eventually earned the respect of voters 
across the country to be the Repub-
lican nominee for President. It was at 
that time that he left the Senate, not-
ing that the next chapter of his life 
would either be in the White House or 
a return to his beloved home State of 
Kansas. As votes were tallied on No-
vember 5, 1996, it became clear that 
Russell, Kansas, would welcome their 
son home. 
But I can tell you with certainty, 
Madam Speaker, that his commitment 
to the United States did not end with 
electoral defeat, as he continued to 
stay active in the causes he fought for 
as a public servant and remained a 
critical activist in Kansas politics. 
Madam Speaker, most of the Rep-
resentatives in this Chamber are famil-
iar with Bob Dole as a war hero, a 
statesman, and a Presidential nominee. 
But I had the privilege of traveling 
throughout Kansas with him. While the 
country has gotten to know Bob on the 
Senate floor or the campaign trail, I 
saw Bob in small towns and coffee 
shops with small business owners and 
farmers. 
My wife, Susan, and I were blessed to 
have known Bob and his wife, Eliza-
beth—another dedicated public serv-
ant—and 
to 
witness 
his 
genuine 
warmth and devotion firsthand. 
In his farewell address to the Senate 
on June 11, 1996, Senator Dole quoted 
the opening verse to Ecclesiastes chap-
ter 3, saying: ‘‘To everything there is a 
season.’’ He went on to say that his 
season in the Senate was about to end. 
Today, we recognize that another sea-
son for Bob Dole has come to a close. 
The Scripture that Bob started to 
read from continues, saying, ‘‘a time to 
be born and a time to die.’’ And later, 
it says, ‘‘a time to weep and a time to 
laugh; a time to mourn and a time to 
dance.’’ 
This week is a time for mourning. We 
grieve the loss of our friend, and we 
pray for his beloved wife, Elizabeth, 
and daughter, Robin.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7624 
December 9, 2021 
This is also a time to honor, which is 
why my colleagues and I were humbled 
to introduce the resolution that for-
mally allowed for Bob Dole to lie in 
state at the United States Capitol ro-
tunda. During his nearly four decades 
of service in the House and Senate, I 
know Bob Dole walked through the ro-
tunda with Kansans and colleagues, 
working to protect our liberties and 
make our country better for all Ameri-
cans. 
It is fitting that he be honored in 
that space today. I can think of no 
other person right now who deserves to 
lie in state more than my friend and 
fellow Kansan, Senator Bob Dole, and I 
believe it will be a long time before we 
see someone of his stature again. 
In the meantime, it is up to the rest 
of us to carry on his legacy, advance 
freedom, and maybe even provide some 
humor to our Nation and our world. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. MANN), who is 
my friend, colleague, and the current 
Representative of Senator Dole’s home-
town of Russell, Kansas. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I want 
to 
thank 
my 
friend, 
Congressman 
ESTES, for hosting this tonight and for 
really doing this to further the mem-
ory and legacy of Bob Dole. 
Bob Dole’s passing leaves a void for 
America. I think maybe it hits those of 
us in Kansas especially hard, so I 
thank my friend for doing this. 
Madam Speaker, America has lost a 
statesman, a noble war hero, and a 
service-minded Kansan who never for-
got where he came from. 
Senator Bob Dole died peacefully at 
the age of 98, leaving his district, 
State, and country better off for his 
many contributions over 79 years of 
public life. 
My prayers and gratitude for Senator 
Dole go out to his family. 
In World War II, Bob Dole was struck 
in the back and nearly killed by a Ger-
man shell just months before the war 
ended. He described his experience 
later in a 1987 speech as ‘‘a sting in the 
shoulder,’’ and he said the first thing 
he thought about was his home, Rus-
sell, Kansas. 
He was expected to die in the hos-
pital, but he lived. He was told that he 
would never recover from his injuries, 
which included paralysis from the neck 
down, but his unquenchable spirit car-
ried him through. 
He simply refused to take no for an 
answer and chose to fight for his life 
and recovery, the scars of which he car-
ried with him for the rest of his life. He 
was awarded two Purple Hearts and a 
Bronze Star for his military service. 
Before he became a United States 
Senator, Bob Dole was the Congress-
man representing the Big First District 
of Kansas. After serving in the House 
of Representatives for 8 years, Kansans 
sent him to the United States Senate 
where he served for 27 years, acted as 
the majority leader twice, and became 
his party’s nominee for the highest of-
fice in the land in 1996. It is inspiring 
and humbling to stand on the shoulders 
of such greatness. 
A few weeks ago, I was blessed to 
spend some time with Senator Dole. 
His love for Kansas and her people were 
on full display in his excited curiosity 
about our plans for the Big First. On 
that day, he was a thoughtful, com-
mitted, and energetic champion for our 
Nation and our way of life in rural 
Kansas. 
He always treated others with re-
spect and kindness, especially his fel-
low veterans, as he attended nearly 
every Honor Flight that came to D.C. 
to the World War II Memorial. 
He was a fierce advocate for his polit-
ical views, but he was equally com-
mitted to cross-aisle friendship and ca-
maraderie. In our meeting, he spoke 
about his idea of the Kansas approach, 
the markers of which he identified as 
honesty, hard work, respect for your 
roots, common sense, service, sim-
plicity, and genuine, thoughtful care 
for people. 
I left our time together inspired and 
commissioned, as Senator Dole made it 
clear we must never forget where we 
come from. He knew deep down that 
the heartbeat of our Nation lies in 
places like his hometown of Russell, 
Kansas. 
I know we all are working actively 
for ways to honor Bob Dole’s legacy. 
One way is by supporting the McGov-
ern-Dole International Food for Edu-
cation and Child Nutrition Program, 
which aims to address childhood hun-
ger, improve literacy, train teachers, 
and make the world a better place for 
young people across the globe. The pro-
gram is named in part after Senator 
Dole to honor his work toward elimi-
nating childhood hunger. Earlier this 
year, I was proud to offer an appropria-
tions request for the McGovern-Dole 
program, and I look forward to its con-
tinued success. 
Yesterday, in another effort to honor 
his legacy, I introduced a resolution to 
name the post office in Russell, Kan-
sas, the Robert J. Dole Memorial Post 
Office. I was quickly joined by my 
other colleagues from Kansas. 
Senator Dole stayed true to his roots 
in rural Kansas and embodied its core 
values of faith, family, and freedom. 
Naming a post office after one of Kan-
sas’ favorite sons in the town that he 
grew up in is a small but meaningful 
way to pay tribute to this Kansas giant 
and American hero. I look forward to 
this resolution’s swift passage com-
memorating the life of Senator Dole. 
A few nights ago, I talked to my 8- 
year-old son, Austin, about Senator 
Dole. After I finished sharing some sto-
ries about his life and work, Austin 
said: Dad, I think God had a special 
plan for Bob Dole. 
That is so true, and God had a special 
plan for all of us when he gave Senator 
Dole the faith, values, longevity, and 
leadership platform that he stewarded 
so well. 
Madam Speaker, I want to close by 
quoting Senator Dole, who often said: 
‘‘I offer a willingness to work hard, to 
hang tough, to go the distance. I offer 
the strength and determination—mold-
ed in America’s small town heartland 
and tempered during a career of public 
service—to 
bring 
commonsense 
an-
swers to the complex problems facing 
America.’’ 
Senator Dole’s legacy will echo into 
the future, and his patriotic spirit 
serves as a benchmark for anyone who 
believes that our brightest days are yet 
to come. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Senator 
Dole for working tirelessly to make the 
world a better place. May he rest in 
peace. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, it is 
great and commendable that the cur-
rent Representative for his hometown 
is here to be able to speak as a fellow 
Kansan and representative for Bob. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. LATURNER). 
The gentleman is one of my other fel-
low colleagues from the State of Kan-
sas who represents the Second Congres-
sional District and was a former State 
treasurer as I was before I came to 
Congress. 
Mr. LATURNER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor, remember, and cel-
ebrate the life of a true American hero 
who was the very personification of 
service. 
I am proud and humbled to stand in 
for the over 700,000 Kansans in my dis-
trict who wish they could be in the 
Capitol today to pay tribute to Senator 
Bob Dole. 
Senator Dole grew up in a small town 
called Russell, Kansas, at a time when 
many hardworking families were being 
burdened by the Great Depression and 
the Dust Bowl. The Doles were not im-
mune to these hardships, living in their 
basement so they could rent out the 
top of their house to make ends meet. 
Bob Dole attended the University of 
Kansas where he was a star athlete 
playing under the famous Phog Allen 
on the Jayhawks basketball team and 
began his service when he enlisted in 
the Army. 
Like many of the Greatest Genera-
tion, Bob Dole dropped everything at 
the age of 21 when he was called to Ac-
tive Duty and shipped off to Italy to 
fight for freedom across the world. 
Toward the end of the war, Senator 
Dole was struck in the upper back and 
right arm by shrapnel from a German 
shell while fighting in the mountains 
of northern Italy and was paralyzed 
from the neck down. He was sent to the 
Percy Jones Army Hospital in Battle 
Creek, Michigan, where he met some 
fellow soldiers who would have an im-
pact on the rest of his life. 
They ended up calling themselves the 
Percy Jones Alumni Caucus, which 
consisted of Senator Dole; the ward’s 
ranking officer Colonel Philip Hart, 
who later became Senator Phil Hart; 
and a longtime friend of Bob Dole, Dan-
iel Inouye, who represented Hawaii in 
the United States Senate.

Chicago, 
and

thought Senator Dole wouldn’t survive 
his injuries, and if he did, they thought 
he would never walk again. But he 
proved them wrong. 
The hospital was turned into a Fed-
eral building and renamed the Hart- 
Dole-Inouye Federal Center in 2003. 
Senator Dole spent the rest of his life 
fighting for veterans and those who 
served our Nation and was instru-
mental in making the World War II 
Memorial in Washington, D.C., a re-
ality. 
After 
being 
awarded two Purple 
Hearts and a Bronze Star for his self-
less service in World War II, Senator 
Dole served in the Kansas statehouse 
and as county attorney before being 
elected to the House of Representatives 
where he served for 8 years. He then 
moved across the Capitol to represent 
all Kansans in the United States Sen-
ate for almost three decades, serving as 
Republican majority leader twice and 
then becoming the Republican nominee 
for President in 1996. 
Senator Dole was a giant in Con-
gress. He fought to preserve freedom 
and democracy while also working 
across the aisle to champion legisla-
tion that has impacted millions of 
Americans from all walks of life. 
b 1730 
Many Americans know and recognize 
his 
major 
legislative 
achievements 
such as the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act and the McGovern-Dole Inter-
national Food for Education Program, 
but many do not realize the impact he 
had on passing legislation that his 
name was not on at all, and how good 
he was at getting things done and mov-
ing the ball down the field for Kansas 
and for our Nation. Bob Dole truly em-
bodied what it means to be a statesman 
and never wavered from his passion for 
a better and stronger America. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
praying for his wife, Elizabeth, his 
daughter, Robin, and the entire Dole 
family as they mourn the loss of not 
just one of our Nation’s greatest public 
servants, but also a devoted husband 
and father. 
I want to close on something that 
Senator Dole once said. He said: It’s 
not who you were, it’s whether you 
made a difference. May we all remem-
ber that every single day in this build-
ing and across this country. 
Senator Dole will be dearly missed. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend, Congressman LATURNER, for 
being here to be able to talk about our 
fellow Kansan and such a great Amer-
ican hero. 
At this time, Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his recogni-
tion, and I thank him for hosting us 
this evening with this Special Order to 
honor a real hero in our country, Bob 
Dole. 
I also thank the gentleman for what 
he did for the bereavement resolution, 
enabling us to have the use of the ro-
tunda, which takes an act of Congress 
to use the rotunda, and to have the cat-
afalque that was constructed for Abra-
ham Lincoln to lie on so that Bob Dole 
could lie on that, a true hero for our 
country. 
I take great pride, Mr. ESTES, in the 
fact that Senator Dole served in the 
House of Representatives as his first 
step in the Congress of the United 
States. I was teased by some of the 
Senators saying, you are laying claim 
to him. He was only there 4 years. He 
was in the Senate over 24 years. And 
yet we do because, again, his service 
here is a source of pride to us. 
But not only that, when he turned 90, 
we had his birthday party in Statuary 
Hall on the House side of the Capitol, 
and so many of his friends and col-
leagues that served with him and 
friends and staff who had served with 
him came, and I was happy to be in-
vited by him to participate in the cere-
mony. It was his 90th birthday, fully 
pledging to be there to honor him for 
his 100th birthday. Well, we made it to 
98 and nearly a half. 
A great life, beautifully lived, one 
that is justified by his lying in state 
and, as I said today at our ceremony, 
wrapped in the American flag. It is 
hard to think of anyone who deserves 
that honor more than Bob Dole, super 
patriot. 
As a young, young person, he fought 
for our freedom in World War II. He has 
been a champion for our men and 
women in uniform ever since, along 
with Elizabeth Dole, Senator Dole also. 
Senator Elizabeth Dole took up the 
cause of hidden heroes, those who care 
for our men and women in uniform 
when they come home and need care. 
The beautiful love between the two of 
them is a joy to all who knew and love 
them—know and love them, still in the 
present. And they are prayerful, patri-
otic, lovely Americans. 
Indeed, it was just 4 years, almost 4 
years ago and we gathered under the 
very dome where we were in the ro-
tunda to present him with a Congres-
sional Gold Medal, the highest honor 
that Congress can bestow. We knew 
then, as we do today, that Bob Dole be-
longs among the pantheons of patriots 
memorialized in the rotunda. 
And I couldn’t help but thinking, 
watching him lying in state there, he 
felt very comfortable under the dome 
of the Capitol, where he spent so much 
time, but time beautifully spent in 
leadership, making a difference. As his 
casket lies in this temple of democracy 
right now, draped in the American flag, 
we are so proud. 
From his heroism in World War II to 
his leadership in the House and the 
Senate, he served our Nation with leg-
endary courage, dignity and integrity. 
Duty was a word that sort of guided his 
actions, his duty to our country and its 
military and the elective office and as 
an elder statesman in this country. 
He was greatly admired on both sides 
of the aisle, on both sides of the Cap-
itol, and across the country because he 
was a person of integrity, a person of 
his word. He worked in a bipartisan 
way, whether it was addressing hunger 
in America, respect for people with dis-
abilities, and advocates for troops, vet-
erans and our hidden heroes and, of 
course, he took great pride in his work 
on Social Security. 
He continued his powerful legacy be-
yond his retirement from Congress, 
alongside, again, his loving wife and 
prayerful partner, Senator Elizabeth 
Dole. His life and legacy will forever 
challenge us to act worthy of him. As 
he said, we shouldn’t try to change the 
ideals of our country. We should try to 
be worthy of them. 
May it be a comfort to his beloved 
wife, Elizabeth, his dear, dear daugh-
ter, Robin, his longtime colleagues and 
friends, and the people of Kansas that a 
grateful Nation joins them and prays 
for them at this sad time as we mourn 
with him. 
May he rest in a very much-deserved 
peace. 
Thank you, Senator Dole, for your 
leadership to our country, for being a 
leader, exemplary leader, one that ev-
eryone would want to be like. We are 
going to miss him, his humor. He was 
very funny and very serious and very 
patriotic. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. ESTES 
for bringing us together to say some 
more words about Senator Robert Dole. 
It is such an honor to have him lie in 
state under the rotunda, an honor 
shared by very few people, but one very 
much deserved by Senator Dole. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentlewoman saying those 
kind words about a son of Kansas and a 
fellow American hero that we appre-
ciate so much. 
We have spent a lot of time tonight 
talking about all of the great things 
about Bob Dole and his relationship 
with Kansas, but he had a bigger im-
pact on people across the country, in-
cluding his relationship with his wife, 
Elizabeth, and all the relationships 
there. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
ROUZER), a former policy adviser for 
Senator Elizabeth Dole. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Senator Bob Dole, one of America’s 
greatest. I have so many different 
memories from over the years, it is 
hard to know where to start or where 
to finish. 
Though I first came to Capitol Hill 
when Senator Dole was still in the U.S. 
Senate, my first extended interaction 
with him was when his wife, Elizabeth, 
was running for the U.S. Senate to suc-
ceed my current boss at the time, U.S. 
Senator Jesse Helms, who was retiring. 
There was one day I remember so 
well. I had taken time off from my 
work to help with Elizabeth’s cam-
paign. And of course, Bob Dole, no 
stranger to North Carolina, came to 
town several times to campaign for 
her.

December 9, 2021 
On this particular occasion, we had 
lined up a number of visits for Bob 
Dole that included a stop at a tobacco 
receiving station in Smithfield, and 
then on to several other stops in Golds-
boro. 
As is the case with any campaign, 
there was little down time, which is 
just how Bob Dole liked it. He had a 
real knack for retail campaigning. He 
was never at a loss for words, always 
had a quip, and always left everyone 
laughing. 
As I recall, it was about 11:30 a.m. 
that day, and we had just finished up 
the stop at the tobacco receiving sta-
tion where we had met with a number 
of tobacco farmers. Now we were on 
our way to Goldsboro. I wasn’t that 
hungry, but I could tell the campaign 
staffer driving Bob Dole was ready to 
find some lunch somewhere. 
Well, Bob Dole was hungry too, but 
had a little bit different of an idea 
about it. So once we leave the tobacco 
receiving station, he directs the young 
man to stop at a local convenience 
store. Bob Dole goes in, talks it up 
with the lady running the cash reg-
ister, buys a Krispy Kreme doughnut, 
and comes back out. 
Sensing this was the only lunch stop 
Bob Dole wanted to make, the young 
staffer turned to him and said: ‘‘Sen-
ator, don’t you want to stop and get a 
real lunch somewhere?’’ 
The 
Senator 
replied: 
‘‘Bob 
Dole 
doesn’t eat lunch until after the elec-
tion; as only Bob Dole can say it. And 
of course, he often talked in third per-
son. 
I would see Bob Dole from time to 
time after that election, but I didn’t 
get to really know him until I came to 
Washington as a new Member of this 
House of Representatives. He would 
call from time to time to talk about 
my campaign; to see if I had an oppo-
nent; to talk about what was going on 
in the House and the Senate; or just to 
talk life and politics in general. I will 
always cherish those conversations. 
A great Kansan from humble roots, 
Senator Bob Dole answered the call to 
serve his country, fighting for liberty 
for 79 years. It wasn’t long ago that I 
got to visit the site where he was so 
badly injured in Italy. 
As I looked around the landscape of 
that, that spot where he was wounded, 
so far from home in a foreign land, here 
was this very young man and so many 
others like him facing evil head-on. 
Several years previous to that trip, I 
had gotten the opportunity to travel 
abroad to take a look at implementa-
tion of our country’s food aid pro-
grams. I will never forget being in a 
very remote area of Ethiopia, looking 
at thousands of children who were eat-
ing porridge during lunch at school, 
and only because of the McGovern-Dole 
International Food for Education and 
Child Nutrition Program. It was the 
only real meal those children received 
during the day. 
Through his final years, months, and 
even until his final days, Senator Dole 
remained so involved and passionate 
for the principles that made this coun-
try great, while caring for our most 
vulnerable. The number of veterans 
and their families he greeted at the 
World War II Memorial during his final 
years would be far too many to count. 
And that is just a tiny glimpse of what 
he did to support, lift up, and encour-
age others. 
There is no way to properly measure 
his impact, not just in America, but 
around the world. He was the embodi-
ment of the American spirit and what 
it means to be a true patriot and 
statesman. His lifetime of commit-
ment, dedication, and perseverance for 
this country was and is unmatched. His 
legacy of service and statesmanship 
will only grow greater through the 
prism of history. 
Madam Speaker, there are those spe-
cial individuals you get to know in life 
who help you keep it all in perspective. 
I will always be so appreciative of Bob 
Dole, the man, and what a giant of a 
man he was. 
May God’s peace and grace embrace 
his 
wife, 
Elizabeth, 
and 
daughter, 
Robin, as well as the rest of his family 
in the hours, days, and months to 
come. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, it is 
great to be able to have broader reflec-
tions of Bob Dole and all of the things 
and the people that he has touched. He 
served, obviously, a long time in the 
Senate, including as majority and mi-
nority leader, and with his wife, Eliza-
beth as well. 
Madam Speaker, I actually have a 
couple of quotes from our current Sen-
ators from Kansas, and I wanted to just 
mention those as part of this Special 
Order hour tonight. 
The senior Senator from Kansas, 
JERRY MORAN, said: Whether it was on 
the battlefields, in the Halls of Con-
gress, or in his everyday life, Senator 
Dole’s passion and dedication to his fel-
low Kansans and to his country was a 
steady reminder that a single person 
can make a difference and change the 
world. 
He held an unmatched patriotism 
born out of wartime sacrifice that 
marked every day of his existence. Yet 
rather than ask for help, he offered it. 
Senator Dole used his horrific wartime 
experience to be a champion every day 
for those with disabilities and for vet-
erans, and I thank him for his service 
to Kansas and to this country. 
b 1745 
Senator ROGER
MARSHALL
shared: 
‘‘As one the heroes from our Greatest 
Generation, you would be hard-pressed 
to find somebody with a bigger heart 
and more resilience than Senator Dole. 
He was an American hero, a statesman 
of the highest order, and one of the 
greatest legislators of all time. While 
he had incredible negotiating skills 
and was tough as nails, it was his huge 
heart and ability to work across the 
aisle that constantly led the way and 
delivered results for all Americans.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
MEIJER), a U.S. Army veteran and a 
friend of mine. 
Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, this 
week, we bid farewell to Senator Bob 
Dole, a great leader with not only an 
incredible political mind, but more im-
portantly, an unwavering dedication to 
public service. He was not only a dedi-
cated war hero who exemplified the 
very best of what it means to be an 
American, but also someone who set an 
example for others with a commitment 
to pragmatism, bipartisanship, and 
governing in the best interest of the 
American people. 
After being wounded in combat, Bob 
Dole recuperated in my district, in 
west Michigan, at the former Battle 
Creek Sanitarium, pressed into war-
time service as the Percy Jones Army 
Hospital. That facility no longer exists 
in that form, and I am proud to say 
today, it is the Hart-Dole-Inouye Fed-
eral Center, a long-lasting testament 
to not only his wartime service but 
also his connection to west Michigan, 
where, as my colleague, Mr. LATURNER, 
mentioned, his survival was questioned 
and his recuperation was long and 
lengthy, but also where he built friend-
ships and ties, especially with Mr. 
Inouye, that would go on to last for 
over a half century. 
During those nearly three decades 
that he spent in the United States Sen-
ate, Senator Dole was a voice for the 
veteran community. His career-long ef-
forts to help the men and women who 
served in uniform culminated in office 
with the Veterans’ Benefit Improve-
ment Act of 1996. 
He also did not forget, even after he 
left office, that he had attended college 
on the GI Bill in the post-World War II 
period. He helped a young upstart orga-
nization that I volunteered with called 
Student Veterans of America, and 
many others, who campaigned for and 
passed the post-9/11 GI Bill so that our 
generation of veterans could receive 
the same educational benefits that he 
had. 
He made tangible improvements to 
the lives of our veterans through focus-
ing on substance. Throughout his ca-
reer, he never lost sight of the job that 
he was sent here to do. His service is an 
example of how government can truly 
function and serve when we are com-
mitted to prioritizing results over poli-
tics. 
Tonight, my wife, Gabrielle, and I ex-
tend our heartfelt condolences to his 
wife, Senator Elizabeth Dole, and all of 
those who grieve Senator Dole’s pass-
ing. His memory and legacy will live on 
in the contributions he made to our 
Republic. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate Mr. MEIJER bringing that up. As 
we talk about different stories about 
Bob Dole, his time in the hospital, 
when he spent 39 months going through 
and recovering from his injuries, obvi-
ously there are some in-depth stories of 
his time there as well as others.

December 9, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CAR-
TER.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for doing this tonight. 
This is very, very special. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to re-
member the life of a political giant, an 
American icon, and a World War II 
hero, Senator Bob Dole. 
Senator Dole was a remarkable man 
and a driven public servant who I per-
sonally 
strive 
to 
emulate. 
Why 
wouldn’t we? What a great example he 
set for all of us. 
I had the pleasure of spending some 
time with Senator Dole, who even in 
his old age would brave the cold D.C. 
winters to sit out front of the World 
War II Memorial and thank those there 
to pay tribute to fallen soldiers. 
I remember being over there. It was 
cold, and they would set up a stool for 
Senator Dole to sit on. He would sit 
there, draped in blankets, and he would 
not leave until every veteran came by 
and he spoke to them and he thanked 
them and he shook their hand. That 
had to be so special to them. 
There are not many people, let alone 
those as accomplished as Senator Dole, 
who can set aside their ego to thank 
perfect strangers, but he did just that. 
He left an unforgettable impression, 
not only on those that knew him or 
those he served, but on this entire 
country. 
Senator Dole was a generational 
leader and voice that was heard by all, 
even those across the aisle. His zest for 
life and making our country better was 
infectious. Not everyone can curry 
favor with those of a different political 
ideology, but Senator Dole was not like 
every other Member of Congress. 
When describing his time in the Sen-
ate, he quipped: If you are hanging 
around with nothing to do and the zoo 
is closed, come over to the Senate. You 
will get the same kind of feeling and 
you won’t have to pay. 
Didn’t we love his humor? 
I imagine he felt the same about his 
8 years in the House of Representa-
tives, and I can almost attest to that 
myself. 
Senator Dole set an example of con-
servatism and of bravery. There is no 
one more deserving of the honor of 
lying in state at the U.S. Capitol than 
Senator Bob Dole. 
An outstanding example of what a 
public servant should be, his loss dev-
astates us all. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
wife, 
Senator 
Elizabeth 
Dole, 
his 
daughter, 
Robin, 
his 
family 
and 
friends, as well as this country, as we 
all come together to mourn this tre-
mendous loss. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, as a fel-
low Kansan, Bob Dole was able to reach 
out and have such an impact on so 
many people’s lives across the country 
and, in some cases, across the world. 
I do want to make one comment 
about just one of the other people that 
Bob Dole actually touched in his life. 
There 
are 
countless 
Kansans 
that 
worked for Bob Dole and people from 
Kansas that were involved in the work 
that he did in the House and the Sen-
ate during his time there. It is amazing 
the number of people around D.C. or 
back in Kansas or elsewhere in the 
country. 
One particular staff member, David 
Spears, served for 3 years in Senator 
Dole’s D.C. office as an agriculture leg-
islative assistant and 4 years as state 
director in Kansas. He wrote me say-
ing: ‘‘It was an honor and privilege of a 
lifetime to serve on Senator Dole’s 
staff and to serve the constituents of 
Kansas. I learned many leadership les-
sons from him that carried over into 
my additional years of public service 
as well as my career in the private sec-
tor. Senator Dole provided great exam-
ples of strong leadership that included 
listening to all sides and an ability to 
build a consensus on very difficult and 
divisive issues. He was a statesman and 
great American. He made a huge dif-
ference in my life and will be missed.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
TENNEY). 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. ESTES for holding this Spe-
cial Order. We really appreciate his re-
membrances and so many Members re-
membering Senator Robert Dole as his 
body lies in state at our Nation’s Cap-
itol. This is an honor we reserve for 
only the most deserving Americans 
who have rendered such great service 
to our country. Senator Dole has right-
fully earned this honor. 
Bob Dole’s life displayed courage of 
the highest order. As a young man, he 
fought in World War II and was wound-
ed in northern Italy. He carried his 
wounds for the rest of his life with 
grace, dignity, and great compassion. 
Bob Dole became a champion for vet-
erans and those living with disabilities. 
The shadow of Senator Dole’s polit-
ical career looms large. His tremen-
dous influence on American political 
life over the last half century does not 
need to be restated. For now, I will say 
this: That from Presidential campaigns 
to the Senate floor, Bob Dole was an 
unyielding opponent, a steadfast ally, a 
fearless leader, and also a person with 
a tremendous sense of humor. 
Even in that generation we call the 
Greatest Generation, Bob Dole stood 
above the rest. He was a paragon of 
courage, class, and patriotism. As a 
stalwart conservative, he was able to 
work with both Democrats and Repub-
licans to enact positive legislation that 
improved life for all Americans. 
Senator Dole’s compass was never 
swayed by popular opinion or political 
expedience. He stayed the course and 
kept his focus on the eternal principles 
our Founders set forth, principles of 
liberty, integrity, and dignity. His un-
wavering commitment to these prin-
ciples propelled him to great heights 
on the national and world stages, but 
this humble Kansan never allowed him-
self to grow haughty or self-absorbed. 
If anything, his historic career only 
made him even more modest. 
This week, we lost Senator Dole at 
the age of 98. His body lies in the Cap-
itol rotunda, and it is fitting for us to 
honor him in this way. His death is a 
reminder that each of us in this body 
must do what we can to carry on his 
work of protecting and defending the 
United States with integrity, compas-
sion, courage, and honor. 
Bob Dole was a patriot, a public serv-
ant, and a gentleman, and this Nation 
will always be grateful for the incred-
ible life he led. 
World War II veterans are also spe-
cial in my heart, particularly in my 
community where I had the privilege of 
being involved with bringing veterans 
to the World War II Memorial in many 
trips that we had in the 2000s when 
President Bush was in office. 
We took them to the World War II 
Memorial, where I know that Bob Dole 
greeted them. We also took them on a 
nice dinner cruise on the Potomac, 
which they enjoyed, and also visits to 
the White House. Like all of these won-
derful World War II veterans, they were 
much like Senator Dole, really, truly 
of the Greatest Generation. 
I just want to say to Senator Dole: 
We salute you. May God rest your soul. 
May God bless your family and this 
great Nation. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Ms. TENNEY, and I appreciate that trib-
ute to our great Senator from Kansas. 
Bob Dole touched so many people’s 
lives around the country and around 
the world. I do want to just mention 
some of those folks that we have some 
comments from. So I will refer to some 
of those. 
Kansas is an agriculture State. Sen-
ator Dole served as the ranking mem-
ber on the Senate Agriculture Com-
mittee from 1975 to 1978. The Kansas 
Association of Wheat Growers presi-
dent, Justin Knopf, said, in part: 
‘‘Wheat farmers across Kansas are 
pausing to reflect and honor the life 
and legacy of Senator Bob Dole, a life-
time friend to Kansas wheat growers. 
Wheat fields planted to the variety 
bearing his name will carry extra sig-
nificance this season as I and other 
farmers tend to them along their jour-
ney in producing grain to feed and 
nourish people. Senator Dole was an 
endless champion for farmers and also 
for those who were food insecure, and 
saw the potential in connecting grain 
from Kansas wheat fields to those here 
at home and around the world who 
were in need.’’ 
Another thing, as we talk about Sen-
ator Dole, obviously we talk a lot 
about his involvement during World 
War II. As a World War II veteran, Bob 
Dole spent a great deal of time working 
to thank and assist the men and 
women who sacrificed for our country. 
Paralyzed Veterans of America Na-
tional President Charles Brown re-
leased a statement saying, in part:

passing of Senator Bob Dole and ex-
tends our heartfelt prayers to Senator 
Elizabeth Dole and the entire Dole 
family. Prior to becoming one of Amer-
ica’s longest-serving U.S. Senators, 
Dole served in the U.S. Army and later 
became a decorated World War II vet-
eran and two-time Purple Heart recipi-
ent. A champion of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, he devoted his entire 
life to advancing the cause of people 
with disabilities as well as advocating 
for servicemen and women who sac-
rificed their lives for this Nation. Fol-
lowing his tenure in Congress, Dole 
worked tirelessly on seeking U.S. rati-
fication of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities.’’ 
The effects of war left Senator Dole 
with lasting challenges in his life, 
something that strengthened his re-
solve to help Americans with disabil-
ities. 
Maria Town, president and CEO of 
the American Association of People 
with Disabilities, said in a statement: 
‘‘The world as we know it today is 
more accessible and inclusive for peo-
ple with disabilities because of Senator 
Bob Dole. Senator Dole worked to ele-
vate the voices and perspective of peo-
ple 
with 
disabilities, 
encouraging 
greater leadership opportunities for 
disabled people, and sharing his experi-
ence of disability with his colleagues 
to build bipartisan consensus for dis-
ability policy issues. His passing rep-
resents an enormous loss for AAPD, 
the disability community at large, and 
the Nation.’’ 
Senator Dole, through all of his work 
and his life activities, has earned the 
respect of countless leaders, including 
our former Presidents from both sides 
of the aisle. 
Former President Donald Trump re-
leased a statement saying: ‘‘Bob Dole 
was an American war hero and true pa-
triot for our Nation. He served the 
great State of Kansas with honor, and 
the Republican Party was made strong-
er by his service. Our Nation mourns 
his passing, and our prayers are with 
Elizabeth and his wonderful family.’’ 
Former President Barack Obama said 
in part: ‘‘His sharp wit was matched 
only by his integrity, and he lived his 
life in a way that made it clear just 
how proud he was to be an American 
and how committed he was to making 
this country everything he knew it 
could be.’’ 
b 1800 
Many of us recall the moving mo-
ment when former President George H. 
W. Bush was lying in State and Sen-
ator Dole stood and saluted his friend. 
It was a moment that reminded us of 
patriotism, camaraderie, and devotion. 
His son and former President George 
W. Bush said: ‘‘Laura and I are sad-
dened by the passing of a great patriot, 
Senator Bob Dole. This good man rep-
resented the finest of American values. 
He defended them in uniform during 
World War II. He advanced them in the 
United States Senate, and he lived 
them out as a father, husband, and 
friend. Our entire family benefited 
from that friendship, including my fa-
ther. I will always remember Bob’s sa-
lute to my late dad at the Capitol, and 
now we Bushes salute Bob and give 
thanks for his life of principled service. 
Laura and I send our heartfelt condo-
lences to Elizabeth and join our fellow 
citizens in prayer for her comfort.’’ 
Former President Bill Clinton, his 
political rival, who would later honor 
the late Senator with a Presidential 
Medal of Freedom said: ‘‘Bob Dole dedi-
cated his entire life to serving the 
American people, from his heroism in 
World War II to the 35 years he spent in 
Congress. After all he gave in the war, 
he didn’t have to give more. But he did. 
His example should inspire people 
today and for generations to come.’’ 
Tonight, I and a lot of the speakers 
here have talked a lot about the life of 
Bob Dole, and we have talked about 
different things regarding his life in 
Russell, Kansas, the small town that he 
was born in and grew up in, and his 
early outlook as a football, basketball, 
and track star before the war cut that 
plan short for him. 
We talked a lot about his war service, 
talked a lot about how he was injured 
in the line of duty trying to rescue 
somebody 
else 
and 
suffered 
con-
sequences of war, and the time it took 
for him to recover in the field, the hos-
pitalization. 
His small town of Russell, Kansas, 
started a crowdfunding process to help 
him with his recovery, and there was 
actually a cigar box where friends and 
family members made donations to 
help with the 39 months that it took 
for Bob to go through his hospitaliza-
tions and his recovery. 
We have talked tonight about his 
years of service in the House and the 
Senate. We have talked some about his 
involvement with the World War II Me-
morial and how he was a big driving 
force on making sure that that memo-
rial got implemented and was available 
for us as a country to see and recognize 
the work that the Greatest Generation 
did in keeping and providing the free-
doms for us. 
We have talked some about the 
Honor Flights and the effort that Bob 
took. Even when the weather wasn’t 
good, even when he may not have been 
feeling well himself, he would come out 
and greet all these World War II vet-
erans and veterans from other wars 
who were coming to the memorial that 
he had helped implement. 
My father, before he passed away, 
was one of those veterans who was able 
to come and attend an Honor Flight 
and participate in that process. It 
meant so much to watch those vet-
erans as they come through that proc-
ess. They are actually like little kids 
again when they get off the bus and 
tour through the monuments. In some 
cases, they relive some past life, but in 
other cases, they just reconnect with 
their brothers in arms. 
We have talked some about Kansas, 
and we talked about the friends and 
family of Bob Dole. One of his favorite 
sayings was: ‘‘Remember where you are 
from.’’ That is important for us, par-
ticularly as Kansans, to remember 
where we are from and what we should 
do and what we should stand up for and 
be responsible for. 
I had the honor as State treasurer to 
participate in a lot of the stops 
through the counties that Bob Dole 
participated in, and it was a time for 
him to reconnect with old friends. It 
was amazing to see the respect and ad-
miration that came from his fellow 
Kansans as they sat down and talked 
with their friend Bob. 
The funny thing about that, or the 
inspiring thing maybe is a better word 
for me to use, was just to watch his 
interaction with fellow Kansans, people 
who he may not have seen for years or 
in some cases decades, but he could 
talk about the same issues with them. 
He could talk about their family mem-
bers, be able to connect with the sto-
ries that they had and be able to ask 
questions about: Now, do you still have 
that big rock on the hill that was in 
the way when you were trying to work 
through with the cropland? 
It was an interesting life to be able 
to watch and watch him lead. 
He has had an impact on not just 
Kansas but Americans and internation-
ally. The influence on people who he 
has been able to touch throughout his 
life will never be known by all of us, 
but his engagement, his ability to win 
friends, his ability to help lead and 
solve problems will be forever admired. 
There is maybe a small army, if you 
want to call it that, of people who have 
worked with Senator Dole throughout 
his life and were engaged with him ei-
ther as an intern or a staffer in his of-
fice or connected with one of his cam-
paigns or connected with one of his 
causes that he got engaged in. It is im-
portant that all of us recognize the 
value that he has created for the world 
today. 
Last but not least, let’s not forget his 
humor and wit. I mean, we talk about 
all the commentary, and several of the 
stories that were told tonight talked 
about the way he approached life and 
the comments that he made that were 
just reflective of what type of man he 
was. 
Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say, 
may God bless Bob Dole and care for 
his 
wife, 
Elizabeth, 
and 
daughter, 
Robin. Kansans, Americans, and people 
throughout the world will miss him, 
but we are better off for having known 
him and for his years of service that he 
provided to us. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

December 9, 2021 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, for-
give me for taking a moment to sort of 
get organized. That is the hazard when 
you use far too many boards. 
I want to do a couple of things this 
evening. First, I am going to offer a so-
lution because I believe particularly 
my brothers and sisters on the left and 
the administration are in a very bad 
place on one issue, and I think there is 
a genuine solution coming maybe with-
in the next couple of weeks. 
Then we are going to spend some 
time talking about something that is 
often uncomfortable around here, and 
that is the debt ceiling and the reality 
of the math and why it is a sin that we 
are not going to actually engage in the 
stressor and use that stressor, which is 
the debt ceiling, to make a couple steps 
toward reality on what the math looks 
like. 
First off, a little of this is going to 
come across as a bit sarcastic because 
I mean it to. But what happened? A 
year and a half ago, 2 years ago, when 
COVID came to our shores, came to the 
world, we had discussions here, often 
on Zoom. We were going to do the 
science. We were going to follow the 
facts and also accept that what we 
know today will be different tomorrow. 
We were going to slow down the spread 
not because we thought we could avoid 
the virus but because we were worried 
about emergency rooms and others 
being overflowed with our brothers and 
sisters who were sick. 
Here we are, approaching almost 2 
years later. We have multiple vaccines. 
We have antibodies. You saw the data, 
particularly on the Pfizer antiviral 
therapeutic pill. There is a pill com-
ing—if the data is real, if what we read 
is real—that is about 89 percent effec-
tive. Now, it is a lot of pills you have 
to take over 5 days, but there is a 
therapeutic coming that you can take 
at home. And we have home test kits. 
If you will go back to our own rhet-
oric and the conversations with the sci-
entists and experts, it was always: We 
don’t have a therapeutic. 
If it is true, in about 3 weeks, we are 
going to have a protease inhibitor. If 
you read the science on it, it is really 
neat how it snips the protein, keeps it 
from attaching to the cell. It is re-
markable science. It is also going to 
help us on all sorts of other future vi-
ruses. But the ultimate antiviral is al-
most here. 
If this is almost here, why isn’t it 
time to have a simple policy discussion 
saying: Wasn’t this the standard that 
we were all hoping and waiting for, the 
technology, the belief in science that 
would allow us to declare the pandemic 
over? 
By doing that, the dystopian sort of 
fight that is going on in our society, 
where the Senate yesterday said no 
vaccine mandates—what is it now? 
Five different Federal courts have said 
it is unconstitutional. Brother after 
brother, sister after sister, neighbor 
after neighbor, Republican v. Demo-
crat, where now we have turned it into 
an article of faith. 
The left lives in a ball of fear over 
the disease, and the right lives in frus-
tration and anger that they believe 
freedoms are being stripped away in 
the country. 
How about we embrace science? The 
fact of the matter is, go back a year 
and a half ago. This was the miracle we 
were waiting for. It is almost here. 
Why wouldn’t we pass a simple piece of 
legislation that functionally says: Hey, 
when the FDA says that we have a suc-
cessful therapeutic, an antiviral that is 
really effective, let’s declare the pan-
demic over. Let’s get ourselves away 
from this dystopian polarization that 
is not based on science anymore. 
We have turned it into a religion. 
I think we are better than this. The 
fact of the matter is, we dropped a 
piece of legislation weeks ago that ba-
sically said that. It basically said, 
when science is victorious, we will em-
brace the science, declare the pandemic 
over. 
Now, it doesn’t mean the virus goes 
away. It doesn’t mean some of our 
brothers and sisters aren’t going to get 
sick. But the fact of the matter is, the 
math is the math. We have had more of 
our brothers and sisters die this year 
than we did last year. 
Do you remember the political rhet-
oric? Maybe I shouldn’t go there. But 
maybe it really is the moment to con-
sider this, to my brothers and sisters 
on the left. I am extending you a life-
line. I am giving you a chance to back 
away from a society of fear and hate to 
a society that says we conquered. 
Please, for anyone who is listening, 
for my brothers and sisters here in 
Congress, Mr. Speaker, yourself, give it 
consideration. Has science won? And if 
it has, let’s embrace it. Let’s declare 
this pandemic over because it stops the 
cascade effect of removing troops that 
want to serve to the chaos around here 
of, you know, we play this fake virtue- 
signaling game where there are hun-
dreds and hundreds and hundreds of us 
sitting here for hours. We are wearing 
our little masks, but we are all sitting 
right next to each other talking, and 
then pulling our masks down to have a 
drink of water. Come on, it is theater. 
Let’s get back to science. 
b 1815 
A few years ago, I remember being 
here on the floor, and the then Demo-
crat leader got behind the microphone 
and basically called those of us, who 
made it very clear we would not vote 
for a clean debt ceiling, arsonists. And 
that has bothered me ever since. Be-
cause I think actually, in many ways, 
those of us who did not believe in a 
clean debt ceiling, raising the debt 
ceiling once again without some at-
tempt to slow the chaos, slow the 
spending down, I actually think those 
of us who wanted to bend the debt 
curve, we weren’t the arsonists. We 
were actually in some ways the fire 
prevention crew. We were trying to 
save the country, save the society. 
So first off, does everyone understand 
how bad the math is? We are function-
ally borrowing $47,000 every second. We 
borrow $2,841,000 a minute. Okay. I am 
going to speak for, what, a half an 
hour. $2,800,000 is $84 million in the half 
an hour I am going to speak will be 
borrowed. $84 million will be borrowed 
during the half an hour that I speak. 
But we are functionally borrowing over 
$4 billion every single day. And we are 
not heading towards ever paying this 
off. 
And the perverse thing is: Do you un-
derstand in a decade that number al-
most doubles? It almost doubles. 
And back to the rhetoric of arson, 
let’s go back over our history over the 
last 50 years. The only times—well, ex-
cept for one where, God bless them, in 
the eighties, they actually took on the 
shortfalls in Social Security—but you 
look at the different deals that have 
been made to bend the debt curve, al-
most every single one was associated 
with a debt ceiling. It was that one 
stressor. 
We have all heard over and over, Con-
gress will not do something unless they 
feel the pressure, unless they feel there 
is a crisis, unless they are up against 
the wall. And the game that was played 
here saying, oh, let’s just change the 
rules for the Senate. Let’s make it so 
they can do it with 50 votes and that 
way we can just pass this. We won’t 
have to deal with the reality of burying 
people’s future retirements and de-
stroying my little girl’s future in debt. 
We can just avoid it and go home and 
have a nice Christmas. 
But the fact of the matter is, almost 
every agreement we have had has been 
associated with the stressor that was 
brought on by a debt ceiling. 
Gramm-Rudman, 1985 and function-
ally again in 1987. Debt limit increase 
associated with it. Deficit reduction 
and automatic spending and budget 
triggers. 
Paygo. I can’t tell you how many 
times the Democrats here preach paygo 
to me, except for the fraud that paygo 
really is, where on the fifth year we 
will just pretend it no longer costs any-
thing, therefore, it doesn’t fall under 
the paygo rules. But the paygo rules 
functionally every time—four times 
was associated with changing the bor-
rowing limits of the country, the debt 
ceiling. It was supposed to create def-
icit reduction, and it did create some. 
Spending increases must be offset, and 
that is the ultimate cultural change 
that paygo produced. But remember, it 
came about because of a debt ceiling 
fight, multiple debt ceiling fights. 
Budget Control Act. Do you remem-
ber how controversial this one was? We 
actually had a government shutdown 
and other things associated with this. 
But the Budget Control Act, the se-
questration that came with that, if you 
look at it, it was the most successful in 
modern times of bending the spending 
curve. The problem is it is all on dis-
cretionary. And we all know the fraud 
around here is discretionary is now 
down to, what? 10 percent or so. Actu-
ally, no. Fifteen percent of what we ac-
tually spend, if you strip military out.

Military is now 10 percent. The rest of 
discretionary is 15 percent. The other 
70-plus percent is functionally on auto-
pilot. 
But this is the truth. Democrats have 
control of this place. They control the 
White House. They control the Senate. 
They control the House. Okay. Bless 
their precious hearts. But we could 
have used this as a stressor, and there 
have been lots of, oh, my hair is on 
fire. The world is coming to an end. I 
am worried about the stock market, 
oh, wink, wink, nod, nod. And the 
stock market just goes on because they 
know we will fix something. But used 
it as an excuse, even if we have to tell 
our constituents why we are trying to 
do something tough. Because remem-
ber, the lobbyists here in this town 
aren’t here to help us reduce spending. 
They are here with their hands out 
wanting more spending. 
This place is functionally, struc-
turally designed to get everything you 
can, and hell be damned one day when 
we hit that failed bond auction. And 
you all saw today, it wasn’t a big deal, 
but today’s bond auction was slightly 
undersubscribed when U.S. sovereign 
debt was being sold. I am not saying it 
is a canary in a coal mine, but the ca-
nary did have a little cough. 
And so here is what we are going to 
do today. I think the Senate may be 
voting at this moment. We are just 
functionally going to do a debt in-
crease, probably we come back on 
Tuesday, we still don’t know what the 
number is going to be or maybe we do 
the fraud of just do it to a date. Will 
there be any deficit reduction? Any at-
tempt, any anything to force some ra-
tional math of what is going on? 
No. Because it is uncomfortable be-
cause we have to tell the truth about 
the drivers of our debt. 
And what are the drivers of our debt? 
Okay. I have said this over and over, 
but we need to be honest. The left will 
say, oh, it is military, it is rich people 
not paying enough taxes. The right, we 
have our sins, too. We will say, oh, it is 
foreign aid, oh, it is waste and fraud. 
No, it is not. 
The primary driver of U.S. sovereign 
debt is, we are getting old. It is demo-
graphics. And demographics aren’t Re-
publican or Democrat, it is math. And 
you have got to understand how sharp 
this curve is. 
We are functionally right here. So 
here is 2022. Functionally 17 percent of 
our population is over 65 today. You do 
see how fast we start getting up to 
close to 22 percent of our population 
being over 65. This is the driver of our 
debt. 
Remember the math. And I am going 
to do it a couple of times here. And I 
am sorry this upsets people because 
they don’t want us to tell the truth. 
The primary driver of U.S. sovereign 
debt is Medicare. Simply Medicare. 
And then Social Security. And the rest 
of the budget actually is in balance. So 
the next 30 years the rest of the budget 
is actually in balance. It is demo-
graphics. 
If you made a pledge when you ran 
for office around here that you were 
going to protect people’s retirement, 
you were going to protect Social Secu-
rity, you were going to protect Medi-
care, letting it be buried in debt, how is 
that protecting it? Tell the truth. 
And there are solutions. I have come 
behind this mike so many times and 
said: There is technology out there. 
There are things we can do to crash the 
price of healthcare. There are policies 
we can do to grow the economy. Every-
thing should be fixated on what maxi-
mizes economic growth. 
And then the left moves something, 
Build Back Better, their social entitle-
ment spending that the data says it 
slows down the economy. We will be 
poorer and smaller, and the working 
poor will be poorer at the end of the 
decade because of the way they de-
signed their social entitlement spend-
ing legislation. 
We are doing everything half-assed 
backwards. If you lay out, sort of the 
holistic theory, sort of the integrated 
model, yes, you have to fix immigra-
tion, but you focus on immigration 
being about maximizing economic ex-
pansion, not importing poverty; adop-
tion of technology that maximizes peo-
ple being healthy, and cures. 
Remember last week, we came here 
and talked about the miracle from last 
week that we have cured someone of 
type 1 diabetes? Because remember, 31 
percent of all our spending in Medicare 
is just on type 2 diabetes. What hap-
pens if you do cures and end people’s 
misery? Oh, by the way, you get amaz-
ing benefits on our debt. 
The immediate reaction you will get 
from people on the left is, well, 
SCHWEIKERT got behind the mike and 
wanted to cut entitlements. No, I am 
trying to find a way to save them. But 
you save them by changing the cost 
curve. You save them by having a mo-
ment. 
Pretend you are at a 12-step group. 
Isn’t the first step to admit you have a 
problem? This place can’t make it to 
step one. 
So let’s do a little math. 
And I am sorry, I do this over and 
over, but I continue to be just shocked 
at the number of staff around here who 
will grab me in the elevator and say, Is 
that number real? Is this real? And you 
say this is the single biggest issue 
policywise facing Washington, facing 
this country? And we will chase shiny 
objects because shiny objects don’t 
make your brain hurt. We will have 
asinine discussions about, oh, there is a 
vaccine database, there is this, there is 
that, and you realize it is a con. That 
is part of the scam this place does is 
look at the shiny object. We chase that 
because this hurts. 
Reality. And this number is worse 
today. This is based on last year’s 
math. $112 trillion inflation-adjusted 
public borrowing in 29 years. $112 tril-
lion of borrowing will be our publicly 
held debt in 29 years, 77.7 of that is just 
Medicare, 34.8 is Social Security, the 
rest of the Federal budget is in bal-
ance. 
This is just demographics. The cure 
is economic growth and crashing the 
price of healthcare. This will drive 
every bit of public policy, and it is 
coming very fast. 
If you look at our borrowing curve, 
in a decade we go from what is pro-
jected these days where we are going to 
be borrowing a trillion dollars a year 
to a couple trillion dollars a year. The 
debt will and the borrowing will and 
the interest will drive all policy. And 
this place right now the policy is wor-
rying about how to get reelected than 
saving the country and the future. 
Do you understand, a 2-point increase 
in interest rates from nominal interest 
rates that have been projected, if we go 
up just 2 percent—and that is getting 
us actually closer to what the historic 
mean is—in 2051, 100 percent of reve-
nues go just to pay interest. How come 
this isn’t the number one discussion 
here? 
Now the left may have different ways 
to approach it than those of us on the 
right, but you would think this would 
be all we could talk about. And it is 
avoided around here like a virus, ex-
cept we haven’t figured out how to put 
a mask on it and give it social 
distancing, have we? 
And for my brothers and sisters on 
the left, the number of times I will try 
to sit down in working groups with my 
Democratic colleagues—and I believe 
their heart may be in the right place, 
they don’t own a calculator, their 
math isn’t there, but we make public 
policy by our feelings in this place. We 
make public policy because it feels 
good, it has a great title. We get judged 
by our intentions, not by our out-
comes. And that is incredibly dan-
gerous. 
So think about some of the rhetoric. 
And I have done presentations here 
where I walk through every single rev-
enue, the proper term is receipts gener-
ating proposal from the left. And if you 
did all of them and pretended they had 
no economic effects, no secondary ef-
fects—all of them—you still can’t come 
close to raising enough revenues. Even 
a 100 percent tax rate on small busi-
nesses and upper-income families could 
not come close to balancing the long- 
term budget. You can take all the rich 
people’s money and all the revenues 
from those small businesses that they 
own. You can take every dime. 
This is a percentage of the GDP num-
ber. When you get into these sorts of 
numbers, you start doing the percent-
age to GDP. We are heading towards 15 
percent of GDP functionally being bor-
rowing. And if you take every dime, 
you only get about 5 percent to GDP. 
We are screwed. And I am sorry, I 
know that is crass, but I just don’t 
know how to get folks to want to pay 
attention to it. This is the single-most 
important thing going on here. If you 
care about education, if you care about 
health, if you care about science, if you 
care about space, if you care about

equality, if you care about these 
things, when there is no more money, 
when every dime of resources goes, so 
we survive and do our best to avoid 
that failed bond auction—which God 
forbid, if it does and interest rates 
spike, do you have any idea how fragile 
we have made our society? 
b 1830 
And this isn’t often the future. This 
is today. We will kiss up close to, what 
is it, $30 trillion in borrowing, probably 
in the next few months. These are un-
thinkable numbers, and it is here. 
And you have got to understand, 
these projections are based on this con-
cept, a really simple one: There is 
going to be no more wars. There is not 
going to be another pandemic. There is 
not going to be an economic collapse. 
There is not going to be a mortgage 
collapse. 
We have done this to ourselves. And 
then the left comes here and we do 
things like the Build Back Better, the 
social 
spending 
bill, 
which 
ulti-
mately—and we have different numbers 
because God knows what the Senate is 
going to do—but the simple scoring 
from CBO basically said at year 5 it has 
borrowed another $800 billion. 
Oh, by the way, wink wink, nod nod, 
after year 5, we will actually stop all 
these programs and we will start to 
raise revenues to pay it off. We are 
functionally going to add another $4 
trillion-plus from borrowing. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arizona has 6 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, the 
social spending bill, at the end of the 
decade, you realize the economy will 
have missed tremendous amounts of 
economic growth, some of the best 
models coming from the Tax Founda-
tion. We are actually making ourselves 
poorer because of the design of the 
spending. When you tell people, I am 
going to send you a check but you 
don’t have to work. When I am putting 
money into things that don’t actually 
create productivity. 
Remember, what are the two ways 
you pay people more money? Inflation. 
Well, that doesn’t get you anywhere. 
Or productivity. That was one of the 
miracles at the end of the 2017 tax re-
form, is the resources that went for 
companies to buy equipment to be 
more productive so they could pay 
their workers more. And you saw it. 
You saw a miracle of employment and 
wage growth. 
And then the cynicism that when 
two-thirds of millionaires get tax cuts 
under the Democrat’s build back better 
plan. So you tell us the rich need to 
pay their fair share and then you de-
sign pieces of legislation that give hun-
dreds of billions of dollars to rich peo-
ple. And then you tell us, oh, by the 
way, we should put State and local 
back into it, but most of it goes to 
really rich people. 
You want revenues. We did a whole 
presentation here a few months ago 
that said we can show you over 10 years 
$1.4 trillion you can get. Stop sub-
sidizing really really rich people. In-
stead, the left does a piece of legisla-
tion to subsidize them more. I guess 
my intense frustration is we are head-
ing—it may not be the bubble where 
the economy blows up—but we are 
heading to a type of rot because so 
much of this Nation’s resources will be 
used to survive the amount of debt we 
have piled up. And then we are adopt-
ing policies that don’t create any type 
of escape philosophy of, we are curing 
diseases that drive the debt because 
most 
of 
the 
debt 
is 
driven 
by 
healthcare. We are doing investments 
in things that grow the economy. We 
are getting immigration codes and reg-
ulatory codes and other things. We are 
modernizing them so they maximize 
economic opportunity because we actu-
ally give a darn about poor people. We 
give a darn about the working poor. We 
give a darn about people who are head-
ing toward retirement. We give a darn 
about young people having a future. 
And not one of those things is actually 
in the math; it is in the rhetoric. Peo-
ple spin some great stories here but it 
is not in the math. It is just not in the 
math. It is not in the economic anal-
ysis. 
The universities that have looked at 
what is going on right now tell us that 
at the end of the decade, the poor are 
going to be poorer. Come on. What type 
of economic violence is this place will-
ing to subject the working poor, the 
middle class to? We are better than 
this. And there is a path. 
Mr. Speaker, you are not going to 
pay off the debt, but we could adopt 
enough policies to flatten the curve 
that my 6-year-old daughter actually 
has a future. And doesn’t she deserve 
one. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
THE DANGERS FACING OUR 
COUNTRY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Arizona for being willing to 
stand on the floor of the United States 
House of Representatives, when unfor-
tunately so many of my colleagues are 
not, this evening to talk about the dan-
ger facing our country. And the gen-
tleman outlines, I believe if I am cor-
rect, that we will be facing $112 trillion 
of debt come 2050, if we do not change 
course. If we do not take the steps nec-
essary to make changes with respect to 
our healthcare spending and make wise 
policy choices—like any family, any 
budget that you have to maintain, if 
you are running a business, nonprofit, 
a university, virtually everybody in 
the world, or at least everybody in the 
country—except this body right here— 
that has to maintain and balance a 
budget and make determinations and 
make tough choices. 
If the gentleman would indulge me 
for a minute or two, for a couple more 
minutes on the floor. When was the 
last time the gentleman recalls we 
have had the ability to amend a piece 
of legislation on the floor of this body? 
Truly amend it? 
Does the gentleman remember? 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Would the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. ROY. I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Brilliant ques-
tion. And I cannot actually think of 
something that was substantive, where 
there was a collective idea from my 
brothers and sisters on the left or the 
right that there was actual intellectual 
battle here where we made something 
better. 
This place is functionally an intellec-
tual dictatorship. 
Mr. ROY. Would it surprise the gen-
tleman that it was May of 2016, the last 
time that an amendment was offered 
on the floor of this body in open de-
bate? 
Now, to be clear, that is an assess-
ment of leadership in both parties. But 
how on earth can we actually solve the 
problems, I would ask the Speaker, if 
we don’t come down and sit at this 
table, stop looking up at the C–SPAN 
cameras and just sit around this table 
and start with a budget—like any fam-
ily or any business—and say, Here is 
how much money we have. Here is how 
we can responsibly spend for the bet-
terment of the people. Have disagree-
ments about what those priorities are 
and make choices. 
When was the last time that we have 
done that? It is a rhetorical question, 
but I know one data point is that May 
of 2016 was the last time that any 
Member of this body was able to walk 
on to this floor and offer an amend-
ment that wasn’t precooked up in the 
Committee on Rules previously and al-
ready set up by the leadership struc-
ture of either party. 
Would the gentleman agree that that 
is no way for the people’s House to op-
erate? 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Would the gen-
tleman yield to allow me just a quick 
colloquy with him? 
Mr. ROY. I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. The process is 
broken. It is why I come here almost 
every week—and you do, too—and we 
try to just focus on what is ahead of us. 
I just spent a half an hour sort of focus-
ing on debt and deficit. That is not Re-
publican or Democrat, it is what is 
ahead of us. 
You have been here a few years. How 
many actual real discussions—other 
than theater of, We should do a study 
commission. We should write a strong-
ly worded memo; the theater of this 
place—instead of doing what is really 
hard, and understand, you can’t just do 
one thing. That is the great fraud now. 
We have gotten ourselves in such a dif-
ficult position, it has got to be every-
thing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7632 
December 9, 2021 
A couple years ago I came here, and 
we brought in 19 attributes that you 
had to do almost at the exact same 
time to maximize enough economic 
growth, enough technology disruption, 
all the things to make it work. You ac-
tually helped me on some of that. But 
my fear, those are really uncomfort-
able, and you will have an army of lob-
byists really unhappy with you when 
you tell the truth about the math. 
Mr. ROY. Well, the gentleman is 
completely correct, and there is no de-
bate about that. You want to have a 
conversation about solving the Medi-
care crisis driving $112 trillion, then 
you have to have a conversation about 
solving the healthcare crisis. And to 
solve the healthcare crisis, you need to 
actually be willing, both sides of the 
aisle, to take on the army of lobbyists 
representing the insurance companies, 
the hospitals, pharmaceutical compa-
nies—all minting money right now, by 
the way, literally minting money—and 
you have got to be willing to have a 
conversation about that to actually 
figure out how we can transform our 
healthcare system to be patient-cen-
tered, doctor-centered, and not have to 
go to an insurance bureaucrat or a gov-
ernment bureaucrat to figure out what 
your healthcare looks like and then get 
competition, transparency, and drive 
down prices. Because if you drive down 
prices, we can actually solve the Medi-
care crisis. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. The gentleman 
knows in many quarters I am a bit of a 
heretic on this. I actually believe we 
are on the cusp of miracles, if it is true 
that we just found a cure for Type 1 di-
abetes. If the math is true, about one- 
third of all U.S. healthcare spending is 
just Type 2 diabetes—for my Native 
American populations, for my urban 
poor, for my rural Anglo poor—the 
amount of diabetes, the misery, the 
suffering, wouldn’t it be one of the 
most elegant, noble things we can do is 
say, screw this noise we are doing, we 
are going to do our Operation Warp 
Speed. 
Now we see there is a stem cell to the 
islet-producing insulin. There is a path, 
but it requires intellectual discipline, 
telling the truth, and saying no to a lot 
of people who are going to be upset be-
cause a cure ends the misery. It also 
ends the manipulation. 
Mr. ROY. Well, I would agree with 
the gentleman. And to your point, you 
asked me a question about how many 
times we have had a real substantive 
debate. The closest I can remember was 
I made this point about amendments 
on the floor of the House. And the gen-
tleman from Maryland, the leader, said 
in an agreement, Yeah, I wish we had 
more debate on the floor. And I would 
say to the leader, let’s do it. Right? 
Let’s start. 
Let’s drop a bill on the floor, instead 
of a 2000-page monstrosity that costs 
X-trillions of dollars that was passed 
by the Committee on Rules, was 
brought to the floor, that we then offer 
an MTR, and then we go and give press 
conferences about why we can’t sup-
port it. That is no way to actually do 
the work of the people. 
The NDAA bill last week, let’s put a 
bill here on the table and then let’s 
offer amendments. Right? We had a 
whole fight about, draft our daughters, 
about vaccine mandates, all these 
things. Well just start with the NDAA 
and then offer some amendments. Let 
the votes work. Let the people speak. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. CHIP, you are a 
heretic. 
Mr. ROY. I am, I am. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Before I leave 
you, I am still hopeful. I think there is 
a path that saves us, but the window 
for that escape is getting very narrow. 
Mr. ROY. It’s shrinking. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. The speed of debt 
accumulation, the unwillingness to 
deal with complex problems with com-
plex solutions—because that is re-
ality—is closing fast on us. And the 
number of Members who are like you, 
who are willing to come to the floor 
and say very difficult things that are 
truthful, they are becoming rare. I 
thank the gentleman for the colloquy. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the gentleman. I appreciate your stead-
fast commitment to try and speak the 
truth and come down to the floor and 
speak to the American people, and un-
fortunately all too often, an empty 
Chamber. 
I appreciate that my colleagues, 
many of whom were able to get a flight 
and go home—and God bless them—but 
we have problems to solve. And we 
ought to be here debating in this 
Chamber rather than posturing. 
Mr. Speaker, I would note that pre-
viously my colleagues were eulogizing 
and remembering Senator Bob Dole. As 
we all know, he was a World War II vet-
eran who was injured in combat; a man 
of great distinction who served in pub-
lic life pretty much since his service in 
World War II. And he is a reminder, as 
we all know, of losing that generation. 
There are precious few remaining. 
Both of my grandfathers have passed 
who served in World War II. We lost 
Senator Dole this week. I was on a 
flight to Austin, Texas, earlier this 
week, on Monday, with an honor flight, 
with eight veterans of World War II 
who came up for Pearl Harbor Day on 
December 7. None of those eight had 
been present at Pearl. Two of them 
were over 100 years old. One of the 
men, I sat next to him on the plane fly-
ing up to D.C., had served and been in 
combat in Iwo Jima. There is only a 
few of these folks left. 
And what I want to spend a minute 
focusing on, as we are heading out, and 
I know we will be back next week for a 
day, but we are getting close to wind-
ing down and heading home for Christ-
mas. I want to remember what that 
generation did. 
b 1845 
Joe Crute and Jim Swartz remember viv-
idly the merciless, frigid cold they survived 
during the Battle of the Bulge: ice, wind, 
snow, frozen ground, frostbite, amputations, 
pneumonia, Americans dying from hypo-
thermia in a land far away from their homes. 
Approximately 1 million Allied forces en-
dured the inhospitable conditions during the 
fight that lasted from December 16, 1944, 
until January 25, 1945, a span which, of 
course, surrounded Christmas. 
This was the Germans making their last 
major offensive strike on the Western Front 
during World War II. Almost 90,000 of them 
ended up wounded, missing, captured, or 
dead from battle injuries. 
Seventy-seven years later—this was writ-
ten 2 years ago—when recalling the bitter 
conditions of the Battle of the Bulge, Swartz 
stared at his large hands, rubbing them to-
gether as if to warm them. I have something 
to show for it, he said when sharing his expe-
riences. I have the results of that cold. My 
hands are almost to the place where they are 
useless from the frostbite. 
You couldn’t drink the water from the 
lakes due to the fact of dead animals and 
dead bodies in the water, so we had to purify 
that. Some of the boys couldn’t get to the 
water. Some of them, the water was frozen in 
their canteens. So what did they do? They 
ate the snow to keep their body liquefied. 
We attempted to make shelter in the 
ground, but to no avail. You tried to dig lit-
tle holes in the ground to sleep. The ground 
was so hard you couldn’t dig a hole. So what 
you did is you got pine branches off of the 
pine trees, laid them down on the ground and 
laid there and covered yourself up with half 
of your pup tent. That is how you tried to 
keep warm. 
One day, a fellow soldier was mortally 
wounded. He was a little bit bigger than I 
was, Crute said. He was shot in the back. I 
ran and got his mackinaw off. It fit him per-
fect, but when I put it on it was an overcoat. 
It felt good. I pitied the poor guy, but it was 
so cold. 
At that time in 1944, there is the fa-
mous exchange that happened when the 
German commander wrote our com-
mander, General McAuliffe, basically 
saying battalions are ready to annihi-
late the United States troops in and 
near Bastogne. The order for firing will 
be given immediately after this 2 hours 
term. General McAuliffe replied, fa-
mously, ‘‘nuts,’’ and they fought on. 
They battled on. 
Many of the soldiers spent Christmas 
1944 celebrating the best they could. 
The American soldiers were within 
Bastogne. Christmas services were held 
by the Army chaplain. Some in the 
country went and visited with others. 
One story: 
We were out in the outskirts of Bastogne 
and we found this farmhouse. Inside was a 
man and a woman and a little boy and a lit-
tle girl. The wife, she gave us some soup and 
some black bread. We stayed there all night 
in this farmhouse. The war was going on 
fiercely outside, and for some reason the 
farmhouse never got hit. 
We were there Christmas Eve. We 
sang Christmas songs that night with 
this Belgian family. We sang Jingle 
Bells and Silent Night. The words were 
different, but the music was the same. 
The thing that strikes me as we 
think about that generation and think 
about what they did in World War II in 
response to Pearl Harbor, signing up 
and enlisting and going out into the 
Pacific and going into Europe to stand 
up against tyranny around the globe

December 9, 2021 
and defend our country, but also others 
around the world, for an idea and for 
something bigger than they. 
They signed up without a question. 
Churchill famously observed that once 
we were bombed by the Japanese on 
that December day in 1941 that caused 
then-President Roosevelt to come into 
this room and give that famous speech 
about that day that will live in in-
famy—Churchill observed that the war 
would be won. 
The sleeping giant had been awak-
ened because the world knew who we 
were. The world knew what America 
stood for. It knew that that sleeping 
giant had been awakened. Nothing 
could be assumed. It took a massive 
ramp-up, massive sacrifice, rationing, 
women enlisting, Rosie the Riveter, 
men enlisting, going across, 400,000 
dead, represented on those stars at 
that memorial here on The Mall. 
The world knew what we would do. 
The question I would ask my col-
leagues today: Does the world know 
what we would do today? Does the 
world know who we are? Does the world 
know what we will do as we watch 
China on the rise, Russia rattling 
against Ukraine, Iran rattling about 
nuclear capability in an unstable Mid-
dle East, threatening our friend and 
ally Israel? 
The cartels in violence and unrest on 
our southern border—does the world 
know whether we have the resolve to 
stand up in defense of the rule of law 
and in defense of freedom and against 
tyranny around the globe but with the 
resolve necessary to win it? 
When 
President 
Reagan 
stood 
athwart the Soviet Union and talked 
about peace through strength and told 
Mr. Gorbachev to tear down these 
walls, the world knew our resolve. Do 
they today? Can we accomplish the ob-
jectives of defending this country and 
standing up in the world when we 
refuse to do the basic job of managing 
our own affairs and our own country 
responsibly? 
We amassed a mountain of debt in 
World War II: 125 percent of GDP by 
1946 coming out of the Depression. We 
got back and got busy growing our 
economy. We grew out of it and got 
that down. We are sitting here today in 
relative peacetime with $30 trillion in 
debt, barreling toward $112 trillion in 
debt as my colleague just articulately 
illustrated on the floor of the House to 
an empty Chamber, minus myself and 
the Speaker. We are doing nothing 
about it. Nothing. Literally. 
Just last night, there was wailing 
and gnashing of teeth among my col-
leagues because we dared force votes on 
30 suspension votes. Oh, no, we might 
miss a Christmas dinner or a Christmas 
party. Oh, no, we might not catch our 
flight home early enough. 
Madam Speaker, $2.7 billion was au-
thorized last night in suspension votes, 
all bills that often just sound good in 
the 
headlines. 
Three 
of 
us 
voted 
against a bill that would provide $500 
million over 5 years to support re-
search and funding for therapies for 
ALS. I was one of those three ‘‘no’’ 
votes. 
Do you think I want to go back and 
talk to people and families that are af-
flicted by ALS? Where are the rest of 
my colleagues in explaining where that 
$500 million is going to come from? 
When we are faced with a conflict like 
our forefathers were facing, when Pearl 
Harbor was bombed, when Hitler was 
on the march, and we resolved to fight, 
we could because our economy was 
strong enough, and we were disciplined 
enough to try to do the right thing. 
Are we able to do that today when we 
are not even disciplined enough to sit 
here and figure out how to manage the 
budget and the spending of the United 
States so we don’t drive our country 
into complete and total bankruptcy 
and destroy it for our kids and our 
grandkids? 
Literally, everybody, both sides of 
the aisle, say, well, it is just some 
votes. Some people today were giving 
me trouble because one of those sus-
pension votes might be used as a polit-
ical weapon by one of my Democratic 
opponents or one of our Democratic 
colleagues because they managed to 
pass some bill with a 375–40 bipartisan 
vote. 
Oh, no, don’t give somebody a polit-
ical weapon so they can go run an ad. 
Nowhere was there concern about an-
other $2 billion or $3 billion just passed 
through on suspension bills that we 
hardly debated. 
When we talk about and venerate 
men like Bob Dole and men serving in 
World War II, and we look at our 
grandfathers 
and 
our 
great-grand-
fathers who sat there in the frigid cold 
or stormed Iwo Jima or stormed the 
cliffs at Normandy, can we fight those 
fights tomorrow? Are we capable of it? 
Do we have the resources to do it, 
much less the resolve, if we can’t even 
resolve in this body to preserve and 
protect the actual foundation of this 
country to be economically and finan-
cially firm and stable? 
If we don’t resolve, the 435 Members 
of this body, to do the hard work, as 
my colleague from Arizona was point-
ing out, of making tough decisions 
about Medicare and Social Security 
and mandatory spending, but also the 
discretionary spending that I talked 
about last night, but also the National 
Defense Authorization Act that we just 
threw $25 billion at the Defense Depart-
ment with no real reforms or changes 
to how they spend money, how are we 
ever going to save this Republic? 
I said last week in a speech that this 
is the United States House of free stuff 
because that is what it has become. It 
has become an entity that doles out 
money to whatever cause because it 
sounds good and feels good. 
There was $500 million for ALS re-
search. God bless them. I am glad that 
research is going to occur. But some-
one has to sit on the floor of the House, 
and say: Where are we going to get the 
money? Not just print it. 
I can’t go next door to my neighbor 
and knock on the door, and say: Hey, it 
is time for you to give me your check. 
What check? Well, the check for ALS. 
Well, what do you mean? Well, it is a 
good cause. The check for cancer, I am 
a cancer survivor. The check for polio, 
my dad is a polio survivor—whatever it 
might be. 
Not one of us in this Chamber has the 
right to knock on our neighbor’s door, 
and say: Give me a check to go give to 
another thing. You wouldn’t do that. 
But through the power of this body as 
a 
whole 
we 
print 
money, 
borrow 
money, and then dole it out for polit-
ical benefit and nothing more. It is 
cowardly. It is embarrassing. It is de-
stroying the Republic. 
Thread by thread, the flag is getting 
tattered because we refuse to do the 
hard work, as my friend from Arizona 
said, of making tough decisions to en-
sure that we can sustain this Republic. 
We will come back in next week and 
the debt ceiling will get raised. That is 
as true as the Sun coming up in the 
east. Not a thing will be done to right 
the ship of the massive amount of debt 
piling up around the ears of our kids 
and our grandkids. Nothing will be 
done next week to solve that problem. 
Republicans will blame Democrats 
using a crazy procedural ploy in the 
Senate, passing a bill to blow up the 
filibuster to allow the debt ceiling on a 
supposed one-time basis to be raised 
with a 51-vote threshold so that they 
can go back to the American people, 
and say: I didn’t vote to raise the debt 
ceiling, but you did. 
Don’t let them hide. They did. They 
concocted the scheme. They voted to 
make sure that that happened, and the 
debt ceiling will be raised. Not a thing 
will change about how we carry out our 
work. Nothing will be done to make 
this country fiscally sound again. 
Madam Speaker, may I ask how 
much time I have left. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MANNING). The gentleman has 5 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, let me 
take a minute to thank the staff, the 
floor staff. We come down here and 
speak into late hours. We have votes 
like last night that go until 9 p.m. or 10 
p.m. because some of us forced some 
votes. I appreciate all of your hard 
work. As a former staffer, I know it is 
not easy. 
b 1900 
The American people are a great peo-
ple. The American people want this 
body, the Senate, and their leadership 
in Washington to actually represent 
them again. I am going to keep giving 
this speech over and over again, and I 
am going to keep calling for this body 
to do the hard work of representation. 
We don’t govern; we represent. 
Those men who sat in the freezing 
cold—frostbite, 
amputations, 
pneu-
monia, death, and picking up jackets 
off of their fallen compatriot to stay 
warm to defeat Hitler’s Germany—

those men who responded to Pearl Har-
bor 80 years ago this week, and Presi-
dent 
Washington 
overlooking 
this 
Chamber here in that portrait crossing 
the Delaware Christmas Eve night 1776, 
what will we do to honor their memo-
ries? 
What will we do to carry forward this 
Republic for which they fought, died, 
bled, and lost limbs? Senator Dole car-
rying a pen in his crippled hand, what 
will we do to honor that sacrifice? 
That is our calling as we embark on 
the second half of this Congress. I don’t 
accept that just because my party is 
not in control of this Chamber for the 
next year that we can’t find a way to 
actually do the hard work of represen-
tation. 
My ask of the Speaker, the leader, 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, and my colleagues on this side of 
the aisle: restore regular order on this 
floor. Bring bills to the floor and allow 
us to vote, debate, amend, and do the 
work the American people expect us to 
do. 
It is the least that we can do to 
honor the memory of those World War 
II veterans whom we are losing by the 
day, all of those who have sacrificed to 
defend this country, and all of those 
who sat there on that Christmas Eve 
day in Bastogne singing Christmas car-
ols hoping to get back to this great 
country. 
Let’s fight to save that great coun-
try. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING ROBERT J. DOLE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, ear-
lier this morning, it was my honor to 
join with President Biden, the Vice 
President, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL, 
the 
Speaker, and other congressional lead-
ers in paying a final tribute to our 
former colleague, Senator Bob Dole of 
Kansas. 
From defending our country in World 
War II, where he fought the Nazis on 
the hillsides of Italy, to dedicating his 
final years advocating with disabled 
Americans and veterans, Senator Dole 
redefined and elevated what it means 
to serve our country. By 21, he had 
given more of himself than most of us 
give in a lifetime, and then he kept 
going for 70 years after that. 
Leader Dole, rest in peace. Thank 
you for all you did to make our coun-
try better. And I extend my condo-
lences and prayers to his wife, Senator 
Elizabeth Dole, their family, and all 
who mourn the loss of the gentleman 
from Kansas. 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. President, now on the debt ceil-
ing. 
Later today, the Senate is going to 
hold a crucial vote that will enable us 
to address the debt ceiling on a fast- 
track basis, avoiding the prospect of a 
catastrophic, calamitous default on our 
sovereign debt. 
The proposal I worked on with Lead-
er MCCONNELL will allow Democrats to 
do precisely what we have been seeking 
to do for months, what I have been 
coming down to the floor advocating 
since the fall: provide a simple major-
ity vote to fix the debt ceiling without 
having to resort to a convoluted, 
lengthy, and ultimately risky process. 
The Nation’s debt has been incurred 
on a bipartisan basis, so I am pleased 
that this responsible action will be 
taken today to facilitate a process that 
avoids a default. 
I want to thank Leader MCCONNELL 
for working with us on this agreement. 
Our multiple conversations were fruit-
ful, candid, productive. 
This is the responsible path forward: 
no brinksmanship, no default on the 
debt, no risk of another recession.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9054 
December 9, 2021 
We still have a few more steps to 
take before we completely resolve this 
matter, but I am optimistic that after 
today’s vote we will be on a glide path 
to avoid a catastrophic default. 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. President, now on Build Back 
Better. In the first 9 days of December, 
Democrats 
have 
made 
very 
good 
progress on some of our largest prior-
ities for the month. We successfully 
avoided a needless government shut-
down. We cleared the path to address 
the debt ceiling and avoid a default. 
And now we are close to passing an an-
nual Defense bill on a bipartisan basis, 
as we have done for decades. 
Last night, I filed cloture on NDAA 
and, for the information of my col-
leagues, we will vote early next week 
to move forward on this bill. 
Soon we will be able to turn to an-
other crucial item on our December to- 
do list: passing Build Back Better in 
time for Christmas. We remain on 
schedule to bring this bill to the floor 
of the Senate before December 25. Yes-
terday, four Senate committees re-
leased their titles of the Build Back 
Better Act, and the Congressional 
Budget Office released scores for those 
titles. More titles and scores are sched-
uled to be released this week. 
For the knowledge of all Senators, 
the text and scores can be found online 
at the Senate Democrats’ and CBO 
websites. So it is available to every-
body. 
Senate Democrats have also wrapped 
up all of our final meetings with the 
Parliamentarian’s office. Those are the 
meetings where just Democrats talked 
to the Parliamentarian. Republicans 
also get their chance alone. And now 
we anticipate that the bipartisan Byrd 
bath—where both sides are together to 
make their case to the Parliamen-
tarian and argue back and forth—we 
expect those to start next week. 
I want to thank the Parliamentar-
ian’s office and all of our committee’s 
staff for working so hard this week to 
bring us to this point. 
For all the reasons we should pass 
Build Back Better, I want to talk 
about one in some detail this morning: 
extending the child tax credit. 
During the holiday season, American 
families are looking for every option to 
lower costs, make ends meet. So the 
best thing we can do is pass Build Back 
Better before some critical tax breaks 
from the American Rescue Plan—above 
all, the child tax credit checks—come 
to a premature end. That is one thing 
no American should want. 
COVID isn’t over, and so these 
checks shouldn’t lapse either. On the 
contrary, they should keep going. 
Roughly 35 million families will get 
their next $300-per-child check in the 
mail on December 15, and we need to 
assure that they will get their checks 
in January, too, without any glitch. As 
a number of outlets have reported, 
families are at risk of seeing these 
checks end after December, if we don’t 
take action. 
So let’s get this done. Let’s pass and 
enact Build Back Better into law be-
fore Christmas so families won’t see 
their checks come to a halt in the com-
ing months, and families, as they are 
doing their Christmas shopping, can be 
assured that new checks will be coming 
over the next year. 
For the tens of millions of families 
that have taken it on the chin during 
COVID, an extra $300 per month, per 
child could be what helps the parents 
stand on their own two feet. That is 
extra money for groceries, fill up the 
tank at the gas station, pay for dia-
pers. 
These are not luxuries. These are not 
handouts. They are daily essentials 
that nobody should have to worry 
about in today’s day and age. In an af-
fluent society, no one should have to 
worry about these things, and that is 
what these checks do: they bring a lit-
tle more fairness into our economy. 
They say to poorer people: You can 
have a chance and, more importantly, 
your children can have a chance. That 
is part of the American dream. 
Of course, Build Back Better will do 
more than that. It will, for example, 
provide the largest investments to date 
to fight climate change. 
I have been working with my col-
leagues for months to make sure our 
climate investments will be robust, ef-
fective, and will lay a foundation for us 
to keep taking action to fight the cli-
mate crisis here in Congress in the fu-
ture. 
Climate change costs our country 
tens of billions of dollars every time 
that storms we used to label ‘‘once in a 
century’’ slam us. Build Back Better 
will help us address the climate crisis 
by lowering emissions, making our 
communities more resistant to disas-
ters, and protect our planet for the 
next generation. 
Our work on Build Back Better will 
keep going until we get the job done. 
STUDENT LOANS 
Finally, on student loans, Mr. Presi-
dent, as the year comes to an end, tens 
of millions—tens of millions—of Amer-
icans face another looming deadline 
they cannot afford. Soon, the Federal 
Government’s moratorium on student 
loan payments will expire, and pay-
ments are set to resume in February of 
next year. 
Yesterday, I joined with my col-
leagues Senator WARREN
and Rep-
resentative PRESSLEY to call on the 
Biden administration to extend the 
pause on student loan payments. The 
pause expires in January, and it has 
been paused because of COVID. It 
ought to be extended. COVID is not 
over, and students still have these huge 
burdens. They are just readjusting to 
life, where they may have missed 
school or missed jobs or not gotten 
fully paid. So we need to certainly 
pause these payments. But we also 
urge the administration to take the 
next important step in granting bor-
rowers relief by canceling student loan 
debt. 
As we keep recovering from COVID, 
as Americans are looking to cut costs 
and make ends meet, now is precisely 
the wrong time for us to allow this 
commonsense moratorium to end. Ac-
cording to one study, it could strip 
away more than $85 billion—$85 bil-
lion—from American families over the 
coming year. At a time like this, that 
just makes no sense. We should give 
student loan payers a break and keep 
the moratorium going. 
Should the moratorium be allowed to 
expire, the burden will fall the heaviest 
on those who are least prepared to 
shoulder it—on low-income borrowers 
and borrowers of color, who typically 
take out more loans than White Ameri-
cans and end up paying them back over 
a much longer time horizon. 
On the flip side, the President’s deci-
sion to extend the moratorium over the 
course of the year was precisely—pre-
cisely—the right thing to do. It has al-
lowed borrowers to focus on saving up 
for these hard times, to save up for 
emergencies, and to pay down other 
forms of debt. We should keep it going. 
This is about taking one common-
sense, easy step to save people costs. It 
is about racial equality. It is about giv-
ing people more opportunities to build 
wealth 
and 
achieve 
the 
American 
dream. The administration can do it on 
its own. They don’t need any kind of 
congressional approval. We know how 
arduous those things are around here. 
Should the moratorium be extended, 
the administration should take further 
action to cancel up to $50,000 in student 
loan debt per borrower. Imagine the 
economic activity we can see if tens of 
millions of Americans are suddenly 
freed from crushing student loan debt. 
They can buy homes, start a business, 
buy a car, or help send their own kids 
to college. What a boom that would be 
for our country, especially at a time 
now when it is needed. 
For decades, higher education was 
considered a ladder up for tens of mil-
lions of people—for immigrants, people 
of color, and working-class families— 
but, today, it is an anchor weighing too 
many down. These Americans deserve 
relief. They deserve help. They deserve 
to have the moratorium extended and 
their student debt canceled. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

late friend and colleague, Leader Rob-
ert J. Dole, one final time. This most 
distinguished 
soldier-statesman 
now 
lies in state at the epicenter of our de-
mocracy. Our Nation has bestowed this 
honor only 33 times in its history—to 
Presidents, to Senators and Represent-
atives, to heroes of war. 
With today’s ceremony, Bob’s path 
aligned one last time with his Army 
hospital buddy’s, turned longtime fel-
low Senator, Danny Inouye. It was 
amazing 
enough 
that 
Bob’s 
and 
Danny’s paths converged all the way 
from bedside bridge games in the 1940s 
to votes on this floor into the 1990s, but 
now they have both rested on the exact 
same catafalque that has held up our 
great statesmen, dating back to Presi-
dent Lincoln. 
Bob Dole earned these honors many, 
many times over—through a heroic 
fight that began on Hill 913 and left 
lifelong scars, through accomplished 
service at both ends of this building, 
and in a bid for even higher office, con-
ducted with integrity and grace. 
Bob Dole left this Chamber a quarter 
of a century ago, but service to his be-
loved Kansas and his fellow Americans 
remained the focus of his life until the 
moment he was called home on Sun-
day. 
The sting of losing our friend is still 
fresh, but we are proud to celebrate 
this 
extraordinary 
American—now 
draped in the colors to which his entire 
life was dedicated and already at home 
in eternal rest. 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Now, Mr. President, on an entirely 
different matter, on Tuesday, I shined 
a spotlight on Washington Democrats’ 
proposed toddler takeover. They want 
to spend hundreds of billions of dollars 
in order to upend families’ arrange-
ments, create massive inflation in 
daycare costs, and attack faith-based 
providers. 
Now, Democrats say their plan would 
not hurt faith-based providers because 
it wouldn’t explicitly block them up 
front. Ah, but that is only a small part 
of the story. The reckless taxing-and- 
spending spree might not ban faith- 
based providers on day 1, but their 
scheme of mandates and subsidies 
would slowly and quietly push them 
out. 
The Democrats’ bill would deny reli-
gious 
providers 
an 
extra 
funding 
stream for upgrading their facilities, 
which their secular competitors would 
actually get, and their proposal would 
let woke bureaucrats persecute faith- 
based groups unless they leave their 
values at the door. If a Jewish daycare 
wants to prioritize Jewish families, 
they could get thrown out of the Demo-
crats’ scheme for engaging in discrimi-
nation. A Catholic facility could be 
kicked out if families who are reg-
istered parishioners get first dibs. If a 
faith-based provider decides not to hire 
somebody who fundamentally rejects 
their teachings, leftwing bureaucrats 
and lawyers would come after them as 
well. The woke mob that stalks cake 
bakers and florists is now coming for 
church daycare. 
Twenty-one 
organizations, 
rep-
resenting hundreds of thousands of 
faith-based daycares and preschools, 
signed an open letter to the Senate. 
Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Mus-
lims all wrote to Chairwoman MURRAY 
and Senator BURR. 
Here is what they said: 
The Build Back Better Act will suppress, if 
not exclude, the participation of many faith- 
based providers. . . . [P]rovisions in the bill 
text make it virtually impossible for many 
religious providers to participate. 
Let me say that again: 
[P]rovisions in the bill text make it vir-
tually impossible for many religious pro-
viders to participate. 
Now, the far left says that if you 
don’t support the toddler takeover, you 
are somehow out of touch, but they are 
projecting, as it is their Big Govern-
ment scheme that is out of touch with 
the diverse aspirations of different 
families. 
Last year, a nonpartisan survey 
asked families what childcare arrange-
ments they would ideally like. Apart 
from the pandemic, if finances were no 
obstacle, what would American parents 
want? The share who said ‘‘center- 
based childcare’’ was 27 percent. This is 
the only route that Democrats want to 
subsidize—center-based childcare. Just 
27 percent of parents say that is their 
ideal world, and of that 27 percent, a 
majority prefer the faith-based options 
that Democrats would push out. 
Now, a larger group, nearly 40 per-
cent, said their ideal arrangement 
would involve full-time parenting in 
some form, either one parent stays 
home or the two trade off. Another 9 
percent said they would ideally like an 
extended relative like a grandparent to 
be the caregiver. Other families would 
ideally want a nanny share or a neigh-
borhood co-op. 
The 
Democrats’ 
daycare 
scheme 
would give all these people nothing— 
nothing. A family that has sacrificed 
so much so that a mom or dad can stay 
home will not get one penny for books 
or supplies or make up for lost wages. 
A grandparent who leaves a part-time 
job to spend weekdays with their 
grandkids will not get a dime under the 
Democrats’ 
plan. 
A 
neighborhood 
nanny share gets zero help. 
Forget about diversity. Forget about 
choice and fairness. Families would ei-
ther enroll in a specific pathway that 
Big Labor and Big Government like 
best or they get nothing. Meanwhile, 
even in the centers that Democrats do 
want to subsidize, parents would get a 
very mixed bag. 
Analysts agree the new regulations 
would send costs skyrocketing. The 
District of Columbia’s local govern-
ment estimates that these sorts of poli-
cies would increase the cost of daycare 
by roughly $12,000 per child per year. 
Their plan would supposedly use gov-
ernment subsidies to make up this new 
inflation, but that assistance would be 
confusing and uneven. 
So this bill manages to be wildly in-
flationary and wildly unfair at the 
same time. That is pretty hard to pull 
off—wildly unfair and wildly infla-
tionary at the same time. It insults the 
diversity of American families and 
their aspirations. It simply 
hands 
money and power to the same woke bu-
reaucrats who are letting far-left prop-
aganda into K–12 schools and then 
sending the Department of Justice 
after parents who speak up. 
This bill would give HHS Secretary 
Becerra, a hard-core culture warrior, a 
giant slush fund to start shaping the 
care of babies and toddlers. And facili-
ties and families who make different 
choices would be left facing a mas-
sively inflated market with zero help. 
This would be an awful—awful—pro-
posal for American families, even if it 
were free. But, of course, it isn’t. 
Washington Democrats don’t just 
have to explain to parents why they 
want to make childcare more expen-
sive, more inflexible, and more unfair; 
they also get to explain why they want 
to print and borrow hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars to do it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GREEN RIBBON CAMPAIGN 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I am glad 
to be on the floor today, joined by my 
colleague 
Senator 
RICHARD 
BLUMENTHAL
and 
Senator 
LINDSEY 
GRAHAM. 
We all saw and remember the horrific 
images from this past summer when 
Afghanistan fell into the hands of a 
brutal Taliban regime. It was a dif-
ficult time for many of us, especially 
our veterans, our Gold Star families, 
and the families of the 13 servicemem-
bers we lost during that disastrous 
exit, including the family of Marine 
Cpl Daegan William-Tyeler Page of Red 
Oak, IA, my hometown. 
These heroes must never be forgot-
ten. While the tragic exit from Afghan-
istan may have moved off of the front 
pages, and while it may not be top of 
mind for many Americans here at 
home, the devastating situation in Af-
ghanistan is all too real for the hun-
dreds of American citizens and allies 
who were left behind. 
The reality is, right now, U.S. citi-
zens, green card holders, and SIV-eligi-
ble Afghans are still stranded behind 
enemy lines in Afghanistan. 
I am furious over the mishandling of 
this administration’s exit from Afghan-
istan. It was a disaster from start to 
finish. Now, America has a duty and an 
obligation to get these people home or 
brought to safety, plain and simple. 
To those who are stranded in Afghan-
istan today, my message to you is 
clear: I have not forgotten you. Amer-
ica has not forgotten you.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9056 
December 9, 2021 
As my colleagues pointed out al-
ready, we are trying to find ways to re-
mind Congress, the administration, and 
the public of those Americans who are 
still stranded in the country and the 
importance of taking action to get 
them home. 
As a way to remind those around 
that our fellow Americans are still 
stranded and that we need to get them 
home, I am encouraging Iowans and all 
Americans to join me, to join Senators 
Graham and Blumenthal in wearing a 
green ribbon this holiday season. 
We must ensure that America does 
not forget those who this administra-
tion has left behind. 
I am proud to join my colleagues 
today, Democrats and Republicans, to 
ensure we keep the pressure on and to 
get these people, including our fellow 
Americans, home at last. We cannot 
and we will not let them be forgotten. 
I 
yield 
the 
floor 
to 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am honored today to join Senator 
ERNST and Senator GRAHAM in this call 
on America to honor our commitment. 
This effort is completely bipartisan, 
and it is about values and ideals that 
we share and that we should reempha-
size at this time of year, at this mo-
ment in our history, at this chal-
lenging moment in world history. 
We are here to support a grassroots 
initiative called Honor Our Commit-
ment. Our goal is very simply to keep 
this cause present and real for Ameri-
cans, even as we complete the wars in 
Afghanistan and Iraq, so that we keep 
faith with the Afghan allies and their 
families to bring them to safety, to 
evacuate them, to enable them to es-
cape the danger, death, and torture 
that threatens them now. 
For 20 years, these men and women 
helped to protect our troops and our 
diplomats. They are the translators, 
civil servants, humanitarian workers, 
members of the judiciary, and others 
who supported the U.S. mission in Af-
ghanistan. They were at our side, at 
significant risk to them, sometimes in 
combat. I know because one of my sons 
was a Marine Corps infantry officer in 
Helmand Province, and he felt so deep-
ly that he had an obligation to bring to 
safety his translator, which he was 
able to do after years of effort. There 
are many other translators like him 
still in danger there who went into 
combat with our troops and helped to 
protect them. My other son is a Navy 
SEAL—was. He is out now. But he 
knows as well the importance of these 
people on the ground to protect them. 
I fear for other parents in the future 
who will know their sons and daughters 
are in harms’ way and who need those 
folks on the ground, the people who 
speak the language, who know the cul-
ture, who have friends in the commu-
nity. How can we ask them to serve us 
when we are engaged in the same kind 
of conflict, if we fail to honor our 
promises to these men and women in 
Afghanistan who now have targets on 
their backs only because they helped 
us in moments of danger and crisis? 
Most of my colleagues, I think, share 
these feelings of apprehension and anx-
iety on behalf of those men and women 
who now are in hiding, many of them 
with their families, trying to get out. 
I strongly believe that honoring our 
past commitments, keeping our prom-
ises, as every great nation does, means 
establishing a clear, consistent, com-
passionate strategy for the evacuation 
and settlement of all of these individ-
uals and their families. That is why I 
have called repeatedly for an evacu-
ation czar, with clear Presidential di-
rection and authority to implement 
such a strategy and coordinate all of 
the numerous Federal Agencies, with 
all of their individual responsibilities 
and authority, to evacuate and resettle 
our at-risk Afghan allies and their fam-
ilies. 
Our at-risk Afghan allies deserve no 
less. That is what I have said to the 
President of the United States in a let-
ter that I have written to him person-
ally. That is the reason that I offered 
an amendment with Senator GRAHAM 
and Senator ERNST, which, unfortu-
nately, was not included in the final 
version of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act. And that is why I en-
listed colleagues to support it. And, in-
deed, it has broad bipartisan, broad bi-
cameral support to establish a strat-
egy—very simply a strategy—to sup-
port the mission of evacuating those 
at-risk Afghan allies. 
I am saddened that the Congress has 
failed to require this basic plan and ful-
fill our moral obligation. That legisla-
tion directed the administration to de-
velop a plan that would provide for an 
initial, expedited security screening 
and vetting, conducted remotely, if 
necessary, to get our allies out of Af-
ghanistan as quickly as possible. 
We need to encourage rapid departure 
by air charter and land passage because 
the United States has no presence dip-
lomatically or militarily. Those char-
ter flights, the on-land passage, are the 
only means of escape right now, and 
the situation of these at-risk Afghan 
allies and their families is increasingly 
dire and dangerous. 
There are numerous humanitarian 
flights, independently organized and 
funded by nonprofit organizations, to 
expedite the evacuation process in par-
allel to U.S. Government efforts. We 
ought to encourage that assistance, 
not create bureaucratic hurdles to hob-
ble these efforts. 
We need a strategy to have our gov-
ernment engaged with relevant coun-
tries to facilitate transport to third 
countries—or lily pads, as they are 
called—where more rigorous and thor-
ough security screening and vetting 
can be completed before onward move-
ment to the United States or other lo-
cations for resettlement. 
So I am disappointed—in fact, I am 
angry—that this amendment was not 
included in the National Defense Au-
thorization Act, but I am committed 
that we will honor this commitment to 
these at-risk Afghan allies and fami-
lies, and I am heartened by this green 
ribbon initiative. 
And that is why I am wearing a green 
ribbon today and why my colleagues, I 
hope, will do so as well and why I 
thank my friend Sid Goodfriend of 
Greenwich, CT, for initiating this ef-
fort—and all of his support network. 
I want to close by thanking our vet-
erans. I have been inspired over these 
last weeks and months by their deter-
mination to enable those Afghan allies 
who served them to escape the danger 
in Afghanistan. Their steadfast com-
mitment is a part of the reason why I 
feel we need to honor our commitment. 
Those veterans and NGOs, the net-
work of people, the coalition of groups 
that has worked so hard to evacuate al-
lies against all the odds—and my office 
has been proud to work with them— 
have inspired me. 
I call on my colleagues in both par-
ties and in both Chambers of Congress 
and the executive branch to continue 
this work until we enable every at-risk 
Afghan ally to leave Afghanistan. To 
do any less is an immense tragedy, and 
it will forever stain the honor of this 
country if we fail to complete this mis-
sion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want 
to—before Senator BLUMENTHAL
de-
parts—thank him so much for bringing 
this to my attention. And it came from 
his 
constituent—the 
idea—Sid 
Goodfriend, who has truly been a good 
friend to this cause. 
And Senator BLUMENTHAL I find to be 
always willing to work with you where 
he can. And the fact that he has a son 
who served as a Marine infantry officer 
and a son who is a Navy SEAL speaks 
volumes to his family. And to those 
two young men, who served at the 
highest level in the military, thank 
you very much. 
Mr. Goodfriend came to us with the 
idea of what can we do to not let Amer-
ica forget. Afghanistan is hell on Earth 
right now. Twenty-three million people 
are virtually starving to death. ISIS is 
at war with the Taliban. Al-Qaida is 
growing in influence. And people inside 
of Afghanistan are living a miserable 
life. Those who helped us are being 
hunted down. Special operations com-
mandos are now having to choose be-
tween joining ISIS or dying. 
And the point here is not to focus on 
how we got here. I have got my views; 
Senator BLUMENTHAL has his. We have 
agreed, when it comes to going for-
ward, we have to be together. And 
there is plenty of blame to go around, 
so we don’t need to beat on one group 
versus the other right now. What we 
need to focus on is what is next. 
And Senator BLUMENTHAL’s legisla-
tion that I joined with to create a plan, 
an evacuation czar, is the bare min-
imum we need to be doing. Out of

sight, out of mind does not work in this 
environment. 
‘‘Honor our commitment’’ is a phrase 
we use to describe what we are trying 
to achieve. You can’t fight these wars 
by yourself. If America has to go it 
alone in the war on terror, it is going 
to be a very dark period for the United 
States. 
The goal is to get people in the faith, 
in the region, to fight back against the 
radical Islamic movement that would 
take the whole world into darkness. 
And the good news is, for 20-something 
years, people fought. The Afghans died 
in large numbers in the last 5 years. I 
don’t think we lost a soldier in 18 
months. God bless the fallen and God 
bless the injured, but to say that the 
Afghans weren’t fighting is just a dis-
honor to those who fell. 
And now we are out, and we have left 
behind people who had a choice be-
tween standing up to the Taliban and 
ISIS and al-Qaida and siding with us. 
They chose us, and now we are gone. 
We cannot forget them. 
I promise you, how we handle the 
next year or two in Afghanistan will 
determine what kind of a national se-
curity future America has. People are 
testing us all over the world right now. 
I would like to work with Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and others when it comes 
to Ukraine. I want to introduce sanc-
tions with a national security waiver 
that would allow President Biden to 
sanction the hell out of Russia based 
on the military buildup that threatens 
Ukraine, not the actual invasion; to 
give him tools where he can go to 
Putin and say: This is what Congress, 
in a bipartisan fashion, thinks about 
what you are doing. You go forward at 
your own peril. 
I would like to create legislation that 
would make sure this administration 
and other administrations have the di-
rection and the tools they need to end 
this Afghan engagement with a sense 
of honor. 
Honorourcommitment.org—you 
can 
go to that site and get information 
about the status of people in Afghani-
stan. We have gotten some out, but we 
have got a lot left behind. And this 
green ribbon is an effort to remind our-
selves and the Nation writ large what 
is at stake if we abandon those who 
fought along our side. 
I did my Reserve duty in Afghanistan 
on several occasions. My commitment 
was small in comparison to most, but I 
got to know the translators. I got to 
know the people who worked with the 
judges and the law enforcement offi-
cials to bring a rule of law to being in 
Afghanistan. 
I am sure all those who served relied 
upon their translators for their very 
life—not only ‘‘What did the guy say?’’ 
but ‘‘Are we safe?’’ And the bravery of 
Afghans to side with us should be re-
spected and honored. 
And I am going to join with Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and ERNST and others to 
introduce freestanding legislation. We 
will try to do it before the holidays. 
And the one thing I like about Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL: He is the most tena-
cious guy I have ever met without 
being mean about it. He has a deter-
mination for his causes that is unparal-
leled. 
I can understand why your sons went 
in the Marine Corps and the Navy. I 
think they probably get those qualities 
from you and your wife. 
So we are going to take that quiet 
determination. We are not going to let 
this go. We are going to insist that this 
body vote to create a system to make 
sure that those who were with us get 
treated fairly. 
To the American people: You aban-
don those who helped us in Afghanistan 
at our own peril. 
This is a time of reckoning for the 
American people. It is a time of choos-
ing. And I choose honor over abandon-
ment. I choose to be a good ally, some-
one you can count on when the going 
gets tough. And I think that spirit 
really does describe our country. 
So the green ribbon campaign—I 
would like more of our colleagues to 
wear the ribbon during the holiday sea-
son to get people who are looking to 
America for hope see a demonstration 
of our will. 
If you travel abroad, you are shocked 
at how people view our country. We 
sort of fight with each other all the 
time that sometimes we lose sight of 
how important we are. When you travel 
throughout the world—I know the Pre-
siding Officer does this—the people 
care what we think, and they watch 
what we do. 
We still, in spite of all our dif-
ferences, represent the best hope of 
mankind. I really believe that. I think 
our military represents the best spirit 
of mankind. 
I think the men and women who 
fought on our behalf in Afghanistan 
wearing the American flag feel a sense 
of obligation to those who stood by 
them. That is why we wear the green 
ribbon. 
Go to honorourcommitment.org. 
To Mr. Goodfriend, thank you. The 
private sector is going to get involved. 
We are going to get major corporations 
advancing this cause. 
And what can we do beyond wear the 
ribbon and say a prayer? 
We can pass legislation that will 
make honoring our commitment real, 
not just a talking point. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The company claims that three doses 
should provide some protection against 
the variant. It also showed that those 
who had previously had COVID and re-
covered demonstrated stronger immu-
nity to the Omicron variant. 
While natural immunity comes at a 
cost, studies have shown throughout 
the pandemic that it works. Those who 
have recovered from COVID have sig-
nificant protection from both catching 
the virus again and from the most se-
vere symptomatic infections. While 
this is not always the case, and vac-
cination may improve immunity fur-
ther, natural immunity is real. There 
are data to prove that. 
A study conducted in Italy showed 
that natural immunity is more effec-
tive than vaccines at reducing risk of 
future infection. Another study of half 
a million people in Denmark showed 
that natural immunity provides sig-
nificant, lasting protection against in-
fection. 
Finally, a study from three separate 
hospitals in Israel found that natural 
immunity from a previous COVID in-
fection was ‘‘twenty-seven times more 
effective than vaccinated immunity in 
preventing symptomatic infections.’’ 
This, of course, is good news, espe-
cially considering that natural immu-
nity is combining with vaccinated im-
munity in the general population. Re-
cent data from the Nationwide Blood 
Donor Seroprevalence Survey shows 
that almost 92 percent of Americans 
over the age of 16 have COVID anti-
bodies from vaccination or infection. 
The vast majority of Americans have 
at 
least 
some 
protection 
against 
COVID–19—92 percent. 
I believe the vaccines are generally 
safe and effective. I have been vac-
cinated, as has my family. I see these 
vaccines as a miracle, one that is help-
ing protect many millions of Ameri-
cans from the dangers associated with 
COVID–19. 
But I also recognize that millions of 
Americans are separately protected, 
separate and apart from anything else 
that might be there, as a result of im-
munity built up through their natural 
defenses because they have previously 
contracted and then recovered from 
COVID. 
Now, the science shows that this im-
munity is strong, that it is effective, 
and that it is really widespread in 
America. Astoundingly, that informa-
tion is not frequently shared in the 
media and never mentioned by the 
Biden administration. In fact, the ad-
ministration makes no effort to recog-
nize natural immunity in its mandates 
or in its formal guidelines. 
I have asked the Biden administra-
tion to provide clarity on its research 
on natural immunity as well as mean-
ingfully address the research being 
conducted by other countries that 
show natural immunity is strong and 
effective and valid. However, the Biden 
administration has yet to respond to 
my inquiries, inquiries that I asked, 
reasonably, to be answered no later 
than the beginning of this week. 
Tragically, tens of millions of Ameri-
cans have superior protection against 
the virus, even from new variants, and 
yet this administration would still fire 
them if they don’t comply with the ad-
ministration’s mandates regarding vac-
cination. It is as irrational as it is 
cruel. 
I have heard from hundreds of Utahns 
who are worried about losing their jobs 
due to the mandate. They are just a 
few of the half a million workers who 
are at risk of losing their jobs in my 
State. There are 45 million Americans 
altogether who could lose their jobs 
due to this unconstitutional, illegal, 
and immoral overstep. 
The Senate, thankfully, recognized 
that these jobs were worth saving last 
night. Fifty-two Senators, including 
Democrats and Republicans, stood with 
American workers. Now, that resolu-
tion could, of course, fail in the House, 
but it could, of course, be vetoed by the 
President. Nevertheless, regardless of 
that outcome, the Senate’s statement 
last night rings loud and clear. 
Moreover, I hold out hope that the 
American people are being heard—they 
are being heard in the Senate, as evi-
denced by last night’s vote; they are 
being heard in the House of Represent-
atives, which will take up this measure 
in the coming days. 
I hold out hope that the House, too, 
will pass this measure, and I implore 
the President to consider allowing it to 
become law. 
But regardless of what else happens, 
these workers need immediate, real, 
lasting protection from the threat of 
the mandates. One way to have a sig-
nificant portion of these jobs protected 
is to recognize the benefits of natural 
immunity. 
So today I am offering a bill that 
would require that Federal Agencies 
recognize, accept, truthfully present, 
and include natural immunity in any 
regulation. This bill does not say that 
vaccines are bad or unhelpful; it mere-
ly asks the Federal Government to re-
spect widely available science. 
I am glad to be joined in this effort 
by Senators BRAUN, TUBERVILLE, and 
SULLIVAN, who are with me as cospon-
sors. 
This bill would keep Americans em-
ployed and help us beat the pandemic 
in a smart way. I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
To that end, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 2846 and that the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration. I further 
ask that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, unfortu-
nately, even though the Senate has had 
multiple exposures to nonsense ideas 
like this bill, they keep coming back. 
Agencies like the CDC and NIH are 
already looking closely at the data on 
COVID–19 infection and natural immu-
nity; they have been since the earliest 
days of this pandemic. 
In an August ‘‘Morbidity and Mor-
tality Weekly Report,’’ CDC actually 
assessed data from Kentucky and found 
that out of a group of people who had 
been infected with COVID before, those 
who were unvaccinated were twice as 
likely to get COVID again than people 
who were vaccinated. 
And a CDC report from October 
looked at multiple studies and con-
cluded that vaccinating people who 
were previously infected significantly 
strengthened their immune response 
and reduced their risk from COVID. 
In other words, being unvaccinated 
puts you at higher risk of being rein-
fected, period. Getting vaccinated is a 
necessary step to protect you and to 
protect those around you. 
And now our Agencies are focused on 
a new variant, as we know, that ap-
pears to be spreading quickly through-
out the world—Omicron. 
We are in the middle of the deadliest 
pandemic in American history. It has 
killed 785,000 people and counting. If we 
are going to end this, if we are going to 
reopen our economy, if we are going to 
save lives, we need to get everyone vac-
cinated when they are eligible. 
We certainly don’t need politicians 
suggesting they know more than the 
experts and ignoring the data. We don’t 
need bills meant to weaken one of our 
strongest tools to get this thing behind 
us, like the one that the Republicans 
have repeatedly been pressing for. 
Workplace safety standards are noth-
ing new in this country. Immunization 
requirements are nothing new in this 
country. 
And let’s be clear. The emergency 
temporary standard OSHA has put for-
ward specifically provides employers 
the flexibility to offer testing as an al-
ternative to vaccination. 
People are dying every day. Families 
are scared and they are tired and they 
are angry that, even as they try so 
hard to do the right thing so we can 
end this crisis, even after all the 
progress we have made to rebuild our 
economy and get students safely back 
in our classes, get people safely back to 
work, and get unemployment back to 
the lowest level since before this pan-
demic started—all that progress, all of 
our hard work is at risk of being under-
mined by bills like this. 
Can Republicans please stop wasting 
our time trying to take us backward 
and pretending they know more than 
the experts about this disease? Is that 
too much to ask? I think not. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is impor-
tant to remember that the fact that 
someone holds a government post and 
is an expert in a field does not make 
that person capable of making laws.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9059 
December 9, 2021 
Yes, there are lots of experts in our 
government; some of them hold high 
bureaucratic or other executive posts. 
It doesn’t mean that they may make 
laws. 
By operation of the Constitution, we 
are the experts for purposes relevant to 
making law. We are the only organ of 
the Federal Government that may 
make law. 
And so anytime someone starts to 
say they are the experts, therefore, 
they get to make the law, that is a 
problem. 
To call this a ‘‘nonsense idea,’’ to 
refer to this as an idea that wastes the 
time of the American people, ignores 
the plight of almost 45 million Ameri-
cans whose jobs are being threatened 
right now. 
My friend and distinguished col-
league, the Senator from Washington, 
has made an argument against this 
that doesn’t match her conclusion. 
What she is stating is not that natural 
immunity makes no difference—al-
though her conclusion would seem to 
suggest that—what she is saying in-
stead is that someone who has had 
COVID and recovered and therefore de-
veloped natural immunity could de-
velop additional resistance to future 
infections by also being vaccinated. 
I understand this argument. In fact, 
it is an argument that I myself have 
used. I had COVID, I recovered from 
COVID, and I have been fully vac-
cinated. But the question is not wheth-
er you can gain additional protection 
from that; it is whether or not you can 
look at an original COVID infection 
from which someone has recovered and 
accept the fact that it offers at least a 
comparable degree of protection as one 
can obtain from a vaccine. 
So let’s be honest about what we are 
and are not talking about here. We are 
talking about 45 million Americans 
whose jobs are being threatened as 
they head into the holidays at a time 
when economic conditions make that 
unusually intolerable—intolerable as a 
result of many conditions that the Fed-
eral Government itself put in place. 
In all events, this is really a bare 
minimum of what we can do for the 
American people. The burden should 
not be on them to prove why they 
should not be fired—fired by a company 
being threatened by the President of 
the United States with crippling fines. 
This is cruel. It is barbaric. It is not 
authorized by statute or the Constitu-
tion. And in this circumstance, they 
are ignoring science. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise 
this afternoon to request unanimous 
consent 
to 
move 
qualified, 
uncontroversial nominees from the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
I ask unanimous consent that not-
withstanding rule XXII, the Senate 
proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following nominations: Exec-
utive Calendar Nos. 300, 348, 349, 415, 
416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 
425, 426, 427, 484, 485, 569, 570, 571, 589, 
590, 591, 592, 593, 594; that the nomina-
tions be confirmed and the motions to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate; that no further motions 
be in order to the nominations; that 
any related statements be printed in 
the RECORD; and that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action and the Senate resume legisla-
tive session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am 
sorry that we had an objection because 
right now, the HELP Committee has 
more than 30 nominees who are waiting 
on us to confirm them. These are quali-
fied nominees, and they should be on 
the job and working, overseeing crit-
ical parts of the Department of Labor 
and the Department of Education, lead-
ing independent Agencies, and serving 
in very important roles. We need to 
confirm them so they can get to work 
on behalf of the American people, espe-
cially as we continue our economic re-
covery. If we are going to rebuild from 
this pandemic, we need all hands on 
deck. 
Many of the nominees whom I just 
tried to move by unanimous consent 
were voted out of the HELP Committee 
unanimously, and they have bipartisan 
support. But now my Republican col-
leagues are holding up all these nomi-
nations for manufactured reasons and 
in some cases, for absolutely no reason 
at all. 
That was, by the way, not our prac-
tice during President Trump’s adminis-
tration or any other administration, 
and it should not be the practice now. 
Obstructionism is not helping any-
one. All this does is make it harder for 
Departments and Agencies to do their 
work and harder for our families and 
our communities to get the help they 
need. 
It should not be this difficult for the 
Senate to perform its constitutional 
duty and confirm nominees who are 
qualified and supported by both Demo-
crats and Republicans. Republicans are 
blocking or have delayed nominees who 
received support from every Repub-
lican on the HELP Committee, nomi-
nees who received support from bipar-
tisan groups and who will serve in non-
partisan roles, and privileged nominees 
who are supposed to be fast-tracked 
through the Senate as part of a long-
standing bipartisan practice, and that, 
by the way, includes a former colleague 
of ours, Dennis DeConcini. Every one of 
these nominees has gone through the 
full process and cleared the HELP 
Committee. 
I am extremely frustrated that Re-
publicans have blocked nominations 
despite their clear qualifications, the 
history of fast-tracking nominations 
like this in a bipartisan way, and most 
importantly, the critical challenge we 
are facing and the work that families 
are counting on all of us to get done. 
They have been blocking several other 
critical, noncontroversial nominees my 
colleagues have been pushing to con-
firm as well. 
We have heard plenty of excuses from 
across the aisle, but all we know is 
that there is no good reason for this. 
We know these are qualified nominees. 
We know the work they are being 
blocked from doing is important if we 
are going to rebuild our Nation strong-
er and better. I want my colleagues 
across the aisle to know that we are 
not going to give up on this side. We 
are going to keep pushing to get these 
nominees confirmed so they can do 
their jobs and get to work for the peo-
ple and the communities of this Na-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, shortly, 
I am going to be making a unanimous 
consent request in regard to the con-
firmations of several nominations that 
are currently pending before the U.S. 
Senate. 
My colleagues have been pointing out 
that these are unprecedented times 
with the number of Presidential nomi-
nations that have cleared our com-
mittee and cleared committees with 
overwhelming votes—in some cases, 
near unanimous votes—of people who 
are well qualified for the positions to 
which they have been nominated, but 
they cannot take their responsibilities, 
their oaths, until after we have con-
firmed them before the U.S. Senate. 
So, for reasons unrelated to their 
qualifications or the need to have con-
firmed nominees in positions, we have 
seen individual objections to allowing 
these nominations to go forward—ob-
jections from Republican Members of 
the U.S. Senate. I say that because 
these are unprecedented. We have 
never seen mass numbers like we have 
seen in this Congress. 
We have a responsibility. We have a 
responsibility to confirm Presidential 
nominations so that they can carry out 
the missions that we want them to 
carry out and the responsibilities that 
go with the reasons why we think it is 
important enough for the Senate to 
confirm those nominations. We then 
have a responsibility to take these 
nominations up in a timely way and 
act on them. 
Secondly, when we have a confirmed 
person in position, we get greater ac-
countability on the responsibilities of

that Agency. We have a person whom 
we can hold accountable because of the 
actions that we have taken in con-
firming that individual. Both are miss-
ing in regard to not having these con-
firmed positions. 
I chair the subcommittee of the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee that 
deals with the management of the 
State Department, and I am going to 
be asking unanimous consent in regard 
to seven nominees who passed out of 
our committees a long time ago and 
have been pending in the Senate for 
months. There is no question as to the 
qualifications of the individuals, but 
they are not able to take on the re-
sponsibilities for why we decided it was 
important enough to have nominations 
with the confirmations of the Senate. 
That is just not right, and I think we 
need to point that out. 
First, I want to just talk about the 
individuals, and then I will make my 
consent. 
One is Adam Scheinman, as the Spe-
cial Representative of the President for 
Nuclear 
Nonproliferation, 
with 
the 
rank of Ambassador. The nomination 
has been pending before the full Senate 
since October 19—for over 50 days. 
Adam Scheinman is the Special Rep-
resentative of the President for the Nu-
clear Nonproliferation, a position that 
is essential to national security as a 
U.S. Special Representative on the nu-
clear nonproliferation treaties and the 
support of activities to strengthen 
global 
nuclear 
nonproliferation 
re-
gimes. Can you think of a more impor-
tant position? 
Mr. Scheinman is eminently quali-
fied for the position to which he has 
been nominated, and there is no stated 
reason not to confirm his nomination. 
The second is Jack Markell, to be 
Representative of the United States to 
the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development, with the 
rank of Ambassador. Jack Markell is 
the nominee to be the Ambassador of 
the OECD, known as the heavy-weight 
multilateral organization in the area of 
anti-corruption 
and 
keeper 
of 
the 
OECD’s anti-bribery convention, which 
is one of the most important inter-
national anti-corruption treaties. We 
all talk about our commitment to fight 
corruption, and yet we are holding 
back a confirmed ambassador to that 
position. 
Jack Markell is a former Governor 
and is eminently qualified for the posi-
tion to which he has been nominated. 
There is no reason why we should not 
confirm his nomination. 
Marcela Escobari was appointed to be 
the Assistant Administrator of the 
U.S. Agency for International Develop-
ment, USAID. The Assistant Adminis-
trator for Latin America and the Car-
ibbean oversees all USAID activities in 
the region, including the 13 field offices 
for regional programs and 3 Wash-
ington, 
DC-based 
programs. 
Ms. 
Escobari served in the same position 
for which this nomination is being 
made under the Obama-Biden adminis-
tration. 
I must tell you, I was on a call with 
Senator BLUNT yesterday with regard 
to Colombia, the need to up our game 
in regard to USAID activities in that 
one country and so many more. 
Ms. Escobari is eminently qualified 
for the position to which she has been 
nominated. Indeed, she served in this 
position under the Obama-Biden ad-
ministration, and she should be con-
firmed today. 
Atul Gawande has been nominated as 
the Assistant Administrator of the 
United States Agency for International 
Development, another USAID appoint-
ment. He would lead the U.S. inter-
national health, development, and hu-
manitarian efforts worldwide. 
Now, more than ever, we know we 
need a confirmed person in the USAID 
to deal with the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Our leadership is desperately needed. 
We are asking lots of international 
questions today from the Biden admin-
istration. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a 
confirmed ambassador who is respon-
sible for this? 
The nomination has been pending be-
fore the full Senate since September 29, 
for over 70 days. 
Dr. Gawande is eminently qualified 
for the position to which he has been 
nominated. There is no good reason not 
to confirm him today. 
Next will be Marcia Bernicat, as the 
Director General of the Foreign Serv-
ice and Chair of the Board of the For-
eign Service, Department of State. 
The Director General of Foreign 
Service, who serves concurrently as the 
Director of Global Talent Management, 
is responsible for leading the GTM Bu-
reau’s mission of recruiting, retaining, 
and sustaining a diverse, talented, and 
inclusive Foreign Service and Civil 
Service workforce at the Department 
of State. 
The position is critical in the mod-
ernization of the State Department and 
making sure the Department is at-
tracting and training the necessary 
talent needed to tackle the challenges 
of the 21st century. 
This nomination has been pending 
before the full Senate since September 
13, over 86 days. 
I recently held a hearing in the sub-
committee on the retention and train-
ing of our State Department personnel. 
We had lots of questions, lots of good 
things we need to do. We need a con-
firmed administrator in order to have a 
person responsible to carry out the 
changes that we need in regard to the 
personnel at the State Department. 
There is no reason why she should not 
be 
confirmed 
without 
any 
further 
delay. 
My next unanimous consent will be 
in regard to Julieta Valls Noyes to be 
Assistant Secretary of State for Popu-
lation, Refugees, and Migration. 
Now, more than ever, with the ad-
ministration dealing with a backlog 
that has been heightened by COVID 
and with the withdrawal from Afghani-
stan, the Bureau of Population, Refu-
gees, and Migration needs to have a 
Senate-confirmed 
representative 
in 
place. 
This nomination has been pending for 
over 50 days. 
My colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle are questioning the State Depart-
ment and asking what they are doing 
to get people out of Afghanistan. We 
are asking valid questions. There is no 
reason to hold up this nomination from 
the point of view of her qualifications. 
We need this position filled in order 
to carry out our responsibility to those 
Afghans who are at risk today and mi-
grants who are at risk around the 
world. 
Lastly, I will be asking consent with 
regard to Anne Witkowsky, the nomi-
nee for Assistant Secretary for Conflict 
and Stabilization Operations and Coor-
dinator for Reconstruction and Sta-
bilization. 
The Conflict and Stabilization Oper-
ation Bureau is responsible to antici-
pate, prevent, and respond to conflicts 
that undermine U.S. national interests. 
We are putting our national security at 
risk without leadership in the Conflict 
and Stabilization Bureau to assess how 
the United States will engage in 
emerging conflicts. 
We were trying to stop conflicts from 
happening. We all recognize that. The 
risk factors couldn’t be greater around 
the world for conflict. We need to have 
a confirmed Assistant Secretary re-
sponsible for this portfolio in place im-
mediately. 
This nomination was reported out of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee on August 4. Her nomination 
has been awaiting confirmation for 126 
days. 
Dr. Witkowsky is fully qualified and 
should be confirmed without further 
delay. 
So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwithstanding 
rule 
XXII, the Senate proceed to executive 
session to consider the following nomi-
nations: Executive Calendar Nos. 323, 
327, 328, 461, 462, and 528; that the nomi-
nations be confirmed, the motions to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate; that no further motions 
be in order to the nominations; that 
any related statements be printed in 
the Record; that the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tions; and the Senate resume legisla-
tive session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). Is there objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, approximately 
24 hours after the attack at Abbey Gate 
in Kabul, I had the privilege to speak 
with the father of one of the marines 
who lost his life there, a young marine 
from the State of Missouri, St. Charles 
County, named Jared Schmitz. 
His father, whose name is Mark, told 
me of the devastation of losing his son. 
He later spoke in public about his son 
in this way. He said:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9061 
December 9, 2021 
I am very honored— 
This is Mark talking about his boy 
Jared. 
I’m very honored that I could call him my 
son. His life meant so much more. I’m so in-
credibly devastated that I won’t be able to 
see the man that he was very quickly grow-
ing into becoming. 
Thirteen servicemembers lost their 
lives on that day and hundreds of civil-
ians. As a result of the botched evacu-
ation operation, hundreds, if not thou-
sands, of American civilians were left 
behind to the enemy, where hundreds 
still remain. 
Now, I am not going to reveal the 
contents of my conversation with Mr. 
Schmitz, except to say something that 
he asked me, something that he told 
me. He told me, ‘‘Go fight like hell,’’ 
and that is exactly what I am going to 
do until there is accountability for the 
worst foreign policy crisis this country 
has suffered since the Vietnam war. 
We hear from our friends on the 
other side of the aisle that our insist-
ence that we actually vote on nominees 
is unprecedented. I would humbly sug-
gest that the crisis into which this 
President has led this country is un-
precedented. In my lifetime, it is un-
precedented. 
It is unprecedented for an American 
President to watch 13 servicemembers 
lose their lives in an evacuation for 
which he is responsible and then to cel-
ebrate that operation as ‘‘an unquali-
fied success,’’ ‘‘an extraordinary suc-
cess,’’ I believe were President Biden’s 
words. 
Really, an extraordinary success? 
Thirteen servicemembers dead, hun-
dreds of civilians dead, hundreds of 
Americans left behind to the enemy— 
that is success? No, that is a failure. 
That is unacceptable. 
And who has been held accountable 
for this disaster? No one. Who has the 
President fired? Who has offered their 
resignation? Which of the planners at 
the Department of State or the Depart-
ment of Defense or the National Secu-
rity Council has been relieved of duty? 
No one. 
We have seen this movie before. Back 
to Vietnam. In Vietnam, we watched as 
the experts in Washington sent thou-
sands and thousands of Americans to 
die, concealing the true state of the 
war, lying to the American people. 
And what happened to the people who 
planned that disastrous war over all 
those years? Nothing. They went on to 
their board seats. They went on to col-
lect their fat pension checks. They 
went on to be celebrated. And who was 
left to pick up the pieces? It was the 
families of the fallen. It was those who 
lost their lives. 
Well, I, for one, am not willing to 
stand by and participate in that kind 
of theater again. I am not going to go 
back to the families of the fallen in my 
State and say that I didn’t do anything 
while people in this body looked the 
other way. It is time that there was ac-
countability. 
So is this a protest that I am launch-
ing by asking the Senate to actually 
vote on these nominees? You bet it is. 
You bet it is because we don’t need 
more leadership of the same kind in 
the State Department. We don’t need 
more leadership of the same kind in 
the Department of Defense. We need a 
different kind of leadership. We need a 
different direction for this country. 
Until there is accountability, I am 
going to ask that the Senate do the 
simple task of its job, which is to actu-
ally vote on these nominees. The least 
we could do is observe regular order 
and vote on these leadership positions 
at the Department of State and at the 
Department of Defense. 
My colleague from Maryland says— 
and I think he is right—that we have 
got to put national security first. I 
agree with him about that. That begins 
at the top, with the President of the 
United States and the leadership of the 
Department of Defense and the Depart-
ment of State. But I, for one, am not 
going to stand by and look the other 
way while this administration system-
atically endangers our national secu-
rity, imperils the American people, and 
watches the sacrifice of our soldiers go 
by without any accountability, with-
out any change in direction. 
I am not willing to look the other 
way and just pretend it didn’t happen, 
which seems to be the posture that 
many in this body have adopted. I am 
not willing to do that. Frankly, I can’t 
do that because I promised the parents 
of the fallen that I wouldn’t do that. 
So I am going to discharge my re-
sponsibility. And as long as it takes, I 
will continue to draw attention to 
what happened at Abbey Gate and to 
demand accountability for it. 
If I am still here on the floor doing 
this in 2023, so be it; 2024, so be it, until 
somebody is held accountable. I don’t 
care who the President is. I don’t care 
what administration it is. I want to see 
accountability for what has happened 
in Afghanistan, what happened to 
those servicemembers, and what hap-
pened to those hundreds of civilians 
who are even now left behind enemy 
lines to the enemy. 
I would just note one other thing 
about the situation we are in, vis-a-vis 
these nominees. While I can ask that 
there be a vote on the floor of the Sen-
ate, I certainly can’t prevent that vote. 
So you might ask yourself: Why in the 
world, if these nominations are so im-
portant—and, by the way, I agree that 
these are leadership positions. That is, 
in fact, why I am asking for a vote. 
These are leadership positions to the 
Department of State, in this case, the 
Department of Defense in other cases. 
But why in the world we haven’t voted? 
I can’t prevent a vote. None of my col-
leagues can prevent a vote. 
The answer is, ask Senator SCHUMER. 
My friends control the floor. Senator 
SCHUMER is the majority leader of the 
U.S. Senate, and what has he had the 
Senate doing? Well, not much. 
Last week, over a 3-day period—3 
days—how many votes did the U.S. 
Senate take? One. For 2 full days, we 
were in session. How many votes did 
the U.S. Senate take on any subject? 
Zero. If these were such pressing prior-
ities, why isn’t the Senate majority 
leader putting them on the floor for a 
vote? I have no earthly idea other 
than, apparently, he just can’t get his 
act together to do it. 
Here we are. It is 2:15 in the after-
noon on a Thursday. 
Are we voting? 
No. 
How many votes have we taken 
today? 
One. 
Will we be voting tomorrow? 
I doubt it. 
Will we be voting next week? 
Who knows. Apparently it is not that 
much of a priority. 
So Senator SCHUMER has a lot to an-
swer for in many regards, not the least 
of which is his defense of the indefen-
sible Afghanistan debacle and the loss 
of life there. But he also should take a 
look in the mirror. And I humbly sug-
gest that my colleagues across the 
aisle might want to question him as to 
why these nominations that they insist 
are so important aren’t being put on 
the floor to be voted on. 
I would be happy to vote on them 
anytime, but I am not going to consent 
to waving them through and waiving 
regular order until there is some ac-
countability for the disaster that this 
administration has pushed upon this 
country and upon the people of my 
State. 
Now, I have one other—before I ob-
ject—and I am going to object, Mr. 
President. Before I do, I want to pick 
up one piece of bookkeeping item, 
bookkeeping issue with my colleague, 
the Senator from Maryland. Let me 
just say this while I am on that sub-
ject. The Senator from Maryland is 
across the aisle. I want to be clear 
about this with my colleague, the Sen-
ator from Maryland, whom I have 
worked with many times before. 
I don’t doubt for a moment his sin-
cerity or his earnestness on this issue. 
And I know that he thinks that these 
nominations are pressing and that they 
are important, and I agree with him. 
And I am sure that he is frustrated by 
the fact that we disagree on the right 
way to get accountability in Afghani-
stan. I acknowledge that. It is an hon-
est disagreement. 
So I don’t want my remarks in any 
way to suggest in any fashion that I 
question the integrity or the upright-
ness or the sincerity of my colleague 
from Maryland, and I just wanted to 
say to him that two of the nominations 
that he read out I don’t have any objec-
tion to: Adam Scheinman and Jack 
Markell. So if the Senator were willing 
to reoffer those separately, I think he 
certainly would encounter no objection 
from me. 
But with all of that, Mr. President, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Maryland.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9062 
December 9, 2021 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would 
be willing to modify to get those two 
nominations approved. I want to be 
clear. I have been told that there may 
be other objections on the other side of 
the aisle. I would like to get them done 
right now, if possible. I would modify 
my request to get these two nomina-
tions done. 
I have been told that there is a Re-
publican objection to the other two 
nominations. 
Let me just conclude this part of the 
discussion by saying I understand that 
you have a right to demand a vote, but 
you are requiring us to file cloture, 
which means basically it is a filibuster. 
And under the Senate rules, that re-
quires an intervening day; it requires a 
vote and debate on the cloture motion; 
then debate time. And there are only a 
certain number you can get done with-
in a period of time while other ones are 
pending. 
So the fact that we are not able to 
have a process to conclude these nomi-
nations is not the majority leader’s 
fault. It is the fault of the massive ob-
jections that are being made en bloc to 
qualified individuals in regards to 
these appointments. 
And I understand the gentleman’s 
concerns, but the American people 
have a right to demand that there is an 
accountable person to deal with non-
proliferation, that there is a confirmed 
nominee to deal with the remaining in-
dividuals that are in Afghanistan that 
we are trying to get out of Afghani-
stan. And by denying the confirma-
tions of these appointments, we are de-
nying the rights of Americans to have 
accountable people confirmed by the 
Senate in regards to all of these impor-
tant subjects. 
So, for all those reasons, I am dis-
appointed. I will take back to my col-
leagues the offer in regards to the two 
individuals that the gentleman men-
tioned. And if we can clear those two, 
we will try to bring them back to the 
floor and get them cleared. So I appre-
ciate that offer, and we will see what 
we can do about getting those two con-
firmed. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 426 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, after 
Watergate, Congress passed the Inspec-
tor General Act, creating independent 
watchdogs who would ensure integrity, 
transparency, and accountability for 
executive branch Agencies and offi-
cials. 
Since then, inspectors general have 
played a vital role in exposing mis-
conduct by administrations of both po-
litical parties. Over the years, IGs have 
proven indispensable—so much so that 
Congress has repeatedly expanded their 
ranks—originally 12 after the 1978 In-
spector General Act, to now 74 sepa-
rate, independent inspectors general in 
the Federal Government. 
In 1988, Congress created several new 
inspectors general, including an inspec-
tor general for the Department of Jus-
tice. The IG oversees Justice Depart-
ment components ranging from the 
FBI to the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
and the Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion. 
But there is a problem. There is a 
loophole. There is one clear omission 
when it comes to the authority of the 
inspector general. Listen. The Justice 
Department inspector general cannot 
investigate professional misconduct by 
Justice Department lawyers. Let me 
repeat that. The Justice Department 
inspector general cannot investigate 
misconduct 
by 
Justice 
Department 
lawyers. 
This means the Department’s inde-
pendent inspector general cannot in-
vestigate allegations of misconduct by 
lawyers in the Department’s National 
Security Division, Criminal Division, 
93 offices of U.S. attorneys, or even the 
Attorney General himself. 
Well, what does this result in? 
All too often, Justice Department of-
ficials from the administrations of 
both political parties have escaped 
independent scrutiny by the inspector 
general. 
The IG was unable to investigate, for 
example, discovery violations during 
the prosecution of our former colleague 
Ted Stevens. The inspector general was 
unable to investigate the unethical 
non-prosecution agreement with sex of-
fender Jeffrey Epstein. And absent ap-
proval by the Attorney General or his 
deputy, the inspector general cannot 
investigate professional misconduct by 
high-ranking Department of Justice 
political appointees. 
This lawyer loophole, of all places, is 
unique to the Justice Department. The 
Department of Justice—I want this 
clear for the record—is the only, only, 
Agency in the Federal Government 
whose inspector general cannot inves-
tigate 
professional 
misconduct 
by 
Agency lawyers. I hope that is clear. 
Inspectors general investigate the ac-
tivity and conduct of lawyers in every 
other Federal Agency other than the 
Department of Justice. Instead, DOJ 
lawyers get special treatment. They 
aren’t subject to the inspector general 
like every other Federal agency. In-
stead, they are under the supervision of 
the Department’s Office of Professional 
Responsibility, known as OPR. 
Now, I don’t dispute the skill or dedi-
cation of OPR. The problem is not 
their qualifications; it is their inde-
pendence. 
Listen to this. Unlike the inspector 
general, OPR reports to the Attorney 
General, who can control and even ter-
minate investigations. This doesn’t 
happen in any other Federal Agency. 
This creates an unfair double standard 
where every other DOJ employee is 
subject to inspector general scrutiny. 
So if you are an FBI agent, the in-
spector general is going to be watching 
your conduct to make sure it is proper. 
Drug enforcement agents in the De-
partment of Justice, subject to the in-
spector general; U.S. marshals, subject 
to the inspector general; Federal prison 
guards, inspector general. They can all 
be investigated by the independent in-
spector general, except for the lawyers. 
And it enables the appearance, if not 
the reality, of politicization in cases 
where the alleged misconduct involves 
high-ranking Department attorneys. 
For years, literally decades across 
administrations, other Senators before 
us and Senator LEE and myself now 
have worked to close the lawyer loop-
hole with our Inspector General Access 
Act. He advocated for this bill when 
Bill Barr was the Attorney General of 
President Trump. I am advocating for 
this bill when Merrick Garland is the 
Attorney General of President Biden. 
You would be hard pressed to find a 
bill with broader-based bipartisan sup-
port. Our original cosponsors include— 
and he is here today on the floor—my 
colleague Senator GRASSLEY, the rank-
ing member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee; Senators LEAHY, FEINSTEIN, 
RUBIO, 
KLOBUCHAR, 
CRUZ, 
COONS, 
BLACKBURN, BLUMENTHAL, and HIRONO, 
to name a few. 
Last year, we considered this bill in 
the Judiciary Committee and we re-
ported it out of the committee after a 
debate, and the vote was 21 to 1 to 
bring this bill to the floor. Unfortu-
nately, it didn’t pass last year. It 
passed the House. It passed again this 
year in the House. 
This broad support reflects a basic 
principle: No Attorney General from ei-
ther political party should be insulated 
from independent scrutiny by the in-
spector general; and no Attorney Gen-
eral should have veto power over the 
inspector general’s authority to inves-
tigate Department of Justice attor-
neys, whether that Attorney General is 
a Democrat or a Republican. 
Mr. President, I would like at this 
point to yield to my colleague Senator 
LEE. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is impor-
tant to remember every Agency within 
the Federal Government has an inspec-
tor general. Inspectors general play an 
important role in every Agency, and 
they are there for the purpose of inde-
pendently reviewing the actions of 
those who operate that Agency. 
Everywhere you look, these inspec-
tors general serve with independence, 
and what we see from them is work 
product that is publicly released and 
can be digested by the public. It is a 
helpful resource not only for the Amer-
ican people but also to us personally as 
Members of the U.S. Senate, who, in 
our capacity as Senators, have the 
ability and, in fact, the duty of exer-
cising oversight over Federal Agencies. 
With respect to the U.S. Department 
of Justice, a body that really is all 
about law and has a lot of lawyers, to 
put it very mildly, you end up with a 
dichotomy—a dichotomy that can’t be 
found anywhere else. 
In every other Federal Agency, the 
inspector general is able to do his or

her job, to conduct research, to do 
evaluations, issue public reports. And 
those reports allow us to exercise our 
oversight responsibilities. They also 
allow the American people to know 
what is going on in the Agency in ques-
tion. 
We have got a difference within the 
Department of Justice. If you are a 
lawyer within the Department of Jus-
tice, you are covered by the Office of 
Professional Responsibility. 
Now, I want to point out a couple of 
differences within the Office of Profes-
sional Responsibility—between OPR, as 
it is called, and the Office of Inspector 
General. These don’t reflect any idea 
that one is bad and the other one isn’t. 
They are just different. 
The Office of Professional Responsi-
bility does operate on a confidential 
basis. It operates in secret. And I don’t 
use that term denigratingly. It is there 
to perform a specific, highly special-
ized role. 
See, lawyers have a separate set of 
ethical rules and standards they are ex-
pected to abide by. The Department of 
Justice, employing a lot of lawyers, 
wants to make sure that there is some 
degree of consistency and discipline 
within the practice of law. They want 
to make sure that the relative inter-
ests, the privacy, and the profes-
sionalism of the attorney can be bal-
anced with their other investigative 
demands. 
But the inspector general has a dif-
ferent function. The inspector general 
isn’t there to evaluate whether or to 
what extent and in what way any of 
the highly specialized, sometimes com-
plex, nuanced rules of professional re-
sponsibility affecting lawyers in the 
practice of law are concerned. No. The 
inspector general has a much different 
role. 
So that is one difference, is that one 
has a public-facing role; the other one 
has a private-facing role affecting the 
individual attorney or attorneys under 
investigation. 
Secondly—and this one is perhaps 
even more significant in its impact— 
the inspector general operates inde-
pendently of the Attorney General. The 
head of the Office of Professional Re-
sponsibility, by contrast, reports di-
rectly to the Attorney General of the 
United States and can be fired by the 
Attorney General of the United States. 
This is a big difference, and it is a 
difference we don’t see replicated in 
any other Federal Agency—not with 
lawyers, not with any other regulated 
professional class that I am aware of— 
nor should we, because, if we were to 
do that, we would end up creating prob-
lems. 
So this is not about a perceived inad-
equacy or a perceived culture of cor-
ruption within the Department of Jus-
tice created by the Office of Profes-
sional Responsibility. 
That is not at all what I am saying. 
In fact, I believe the people who oper-
ate the Department of Justice, the law-
yers of the Department of Justice, in-
cluding those who operate the Office of 
Professional Responsibility, by and 
large do their job and do their job well 
and faithfully. But insofar as we allow 
them to do their job in such a way that 
it precludes any ability by the inspec-
tor general of the Department of Jus-
tice to penetrate section 8E of the In-
spector General Act insofar as it insu-
lates the operations of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice from investigation of 
the sort that we have come to expect 
and rely on from the Office of Inspector 
General, it is going to be a problem. 
Within the Department of Justice in 
particular, it is a big problem. I think 
it would be unwise in any Federal 
Agency for us to say: OK, the IG can do 
anything that the IG needs to do unless 
there is a lawyer involved. I think that 
would be dangerous anywhere because 
you do have lawyers involved, but it is 
especially dangerous at the Depart-
ment of Justice because so much of 
what they do is law, is necessarily per-
formed by people who are lawyers. 
What happens is that we see count-
less dead ends where, because the Of-
fice of Professional Responsibility has 
jurisdiction, the inspector general may 
not tread. They hit dead end after dead 
end. In the absence of evidence of ac-
tual criminal misconduct, they can’t 
proceed, and nobody else can penetrate 
it. It ought not take evidence of crimi-
nal accountability—of criminal liabil-
ity to enable the inspector general to 
do his or her job. 
There 
are 
myriad 
circumstances 
where someone might engage in un-
seemly, unethical, unwise behavior 
within the Department. Whether they 
are lawyers or whether they are not 
and separate and apart from whether 
those deviate from the professional 
standards imposed by the State bar of 
any State, by the rules of any court, or 
the professional standards for lawyers 
operating within the U.S. Department 
of Justice, there is an adequate, inde-
pendent, freestanding interest that the 
American people have in being able to 
gain access to that information. But, 
alas, since 1988, section 8E of the In-
spector General Act has precluded his 
visibility. This needs to stop. 
As my friend and colleague the Sen-
ator from Illinois stated so well mo-
ments ago, this bill is not either Re-
publican or Democratic; it is not lib-
eral or conservative. I have been a 
proud supporter of this bill and spon-
sored this bill during a Republican ad-
ministration because I believe that re-
gardless of who is in power, we need 
visibility into the Department of Jus-
tice—visibility that we have in every 
other Federal Agency, every one. We 
lack it here. We lack it here with re-
spect to a whole lot of what the De-
partment of Justice does because of 
this loophole in section 8E. What ben-
efit does this bring to the American 
people? To the extent there are bene-
fits there, I respectfully submit, they 
don’t even come close to offsetting 
what we lose in terms of visibility. 
We need this. We need it now as 
much as ever. I implore my colleagues 
to support it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois is recognized. 
Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator 
from Utah for his cosponsorship of this 
bipartisan measure. 
I want to yield at this point to the 
ranking Republican member of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee. I can’t 
think of a single Member on either side 
of the aisle who has been as outspoken 
as Senator GRASSLEY of Iowa on the 
role and the importance of inspectors 
general. 
I yield the floor to Senator GRASS-
LEY. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Senator 
DURBIN, and thank you, Senators DUR-
BIN and LEE, for bringing some com-
mon sense to the principles of checks 
and balances of government. 
In this particular case, it is not 
checks and balances between the legis-
lative branch and the executive branch 
so much as it is injecting another level 
of checks on abusive authority within 
the executive branch. 
So I strongly support this act and the 
bipartisan work of you two Senators to 
bring greater accountability to the at-
torneys at the Department of Justice. 
Congress created the inspectors gen-
eral to be independent. They don’t just 
investigate whatever their Agency or 
Congress might want them to; the law 
says that inspectors general shine a 
light on waste, fraud, and abuse in Fed-
eral Agencies. Sometimes transparency 
is very uncomfortable, but it is ex-
tremely necessary. 
You are not going to get real ac-
countability if you have an Agency’s 
employees policing themselves. Right 
now, the only folks who can inves-
tigate the Justice Department attor-
neys are other Justice Department at-
torneys. This system erodes public 
trust and creates clear conflict of in-
terest. 
For example, the Justice Department 
attorneys reviewed the plea agreement 
given to serial child sex offender Jef-
frey Epstein. I note that many of my 
colleagues here found that internal re-
view 
‘‘substantively 
inadequate.’’ 
Those are words from my colleagues. 
Had the inspector general conducted 
the review, he might have gotten some-
where with it, just like he did with the 
behavior of FBI agents in the Larry 
Nassar case. What if we had left that 
investigation to the FBI to police 
itself? 
This is why the Justice Department 
inspector general has identified as the 
Agency’s No. 1 top management chal-
lenge ‘‘strengthening public trust’’ in 
the Justice Department. One way to fix 
that is to make sure the independent 
inspector general has the same author-
ity over all Department employees. 
Why do FBI analysts and DEA agents 
require 
more 
independent 
scrutiny 
than Department attorneys? This is so 
simple that even a lawyer could get 
this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9064 
December 9, 2021 
I heard rumors that my friend Sen-
ator COTTON may be objecting to this— 
a person I agree with 90 percent of the 
time. 
It 
seems 
to 
be 
very 
uncharacteristic. He and I believe alike 
that there are two ways of doing busi-
ness in the United States: life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness or let the 
bureaucrats run everything. And I 
know Senator COTTON is a person who 
doesn’t think bureaucrats should run 
everything. In this case, nothing is re-
viewable by people who make a deci-
sion not to produce this. That is the 
height of irresponsibility. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator from Iowa for his spirited 
support of this effort. I am glad he used 
that classic example. Of all the hear-
ings—and we have had many good ones 
and many important ones—in the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee this year. 
The one we all remember is when the 
gymnasts came, the Olympic gymnasts 
came. These wonderful, young women 
came before us and summoned the 
courage to tell us about the abuse that 
took place by a man who purported to 
be a doctor, Larry Nassar. 
Sitting next to them during the en-
tire presentation was the head of the 
FBI, taking the medicine he should 
have taken, because the inspector gen-
eral gave us a graphic report of how 
the agents at the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation let those young women 
down. When they summoned the cour-
age to come forward and tell the world 
what had happened to them, it was vir-
tually ignored by the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation. Thank goodness the 
inspector general was there to be crit-
ical, to produce the evidence, and to 
make it clear to the American people 
that this conduct was disgusting and 
deplorable and unacceptable. 
The inspector general was critical for 
the administration of justice. Why is it 
any different if, instead of an attorney 
who works for the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, we are talking about an 
attorney who works in a U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office somewhere in the United 
States or in the Department of Justice 
itself? It shouldn’t make a difference. 
As Senator GRASSLEY and Senator 
LEE have made clear, all we are asking 
for is the same level of accountability 
for attorneys in the Department of 
Justice that applies to every other 
Federal Agency. Why are we treating 
these attorneys any differently? 
Senator GRASSLEY makes the point— 
we are succumbing to bureaucratic def-
erence at a time when we ought to 
have our eyes wide open, and wide 
open, we would see that this bill, which 
was extensively debated and discussed 
last year and reported out of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee under the 
chairmanship of Senator GRAHAM by a 
vote of 21 to 1, wasn’t called on the cal-
endar. We are bringing it back this 
year in the same manner. The bill has 
not changed. We are bringing it back 
this year, and I believe now is the time 
for us to do what is right for the cause 
of justice. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on the Judici-
ary be discharged from further consid-
eration of S. 426 and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration; 
further, that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Arkansas is recog-
nized. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I oppose 
passage of the Inspector General Act. 
This bill or similar versions of it have 
been around for at least a decade now. 
To my knowledge, the Judiciary Com-
mittee hasn’t had a hearing on this 
specific issue—certainly hasn’t had one 
this year. 
As my colleagues have said, this bill 
has bipartisan support, and they have a 
principled position on the bill. The 
Senator from Illinois pointed out that 
he supports the bill now that Merrick 
Garland is the Attorney General, just 
like the Senator from Utah supported 
it when Bill Barr was the Attorney 
General, just like the Senator from 
Iowa supported it when Bill Barr was 
the Attorney General. So it is true it 
has bipartisan support. Bipartisanship 
can cut another way as well. 
To my knowledge, every Attorney 
General, both Democratic and Repub-
lican, has opposed this bill since the 
very beginning of the inspector general 
for the Department of Justice. 
Both the Senator from Illinois and 
the Senator from Utah used the word 
‘‘loophole’’—a loophole that an inspec-
tor general can’t investigate attorneys 
in the Department of Justice. That im-
plies 
it 
was 
an 
unintended 
con-
sequence. That simply is not the case. 
In 1988, when Congress created the in-
spector general for the Department of 
Justice, Congress had detailed negotia-
tions with the Department of Justice 
under the leadership of Attorney Gen-
eral Thornburgh, and they reached a 
compromise to keep investigations of 
allegations of attorney professional 
misconduct within the responsibility of 
the Office of Professional Responsi-
bility. 
In 2007, Eric Holder—not someone 
whom I usually cite as an authority— 
after he had been the Deputy Attorney 
General, called an earlier version of 
this bill ‘‘deleterious and unneces-
sary,’’ and he said he ‘‘believe[s] 
strongly’’ that it ‘‘would create addi-
tional opportunities for improper polit-
ical concerns to influence law enforce-
ment decisions.’’ In other words, Eric 
Holder thought the bill would com-
pound the problem it purported to ad-
dress. 
In 2017, the Department of Justice 
once again articulated similar con-
cerns with the bill. 
Just yesterday, I can relay, the es-
teemed Judge Michael Mukasey—also a 
former Attorney General—said that he 
opposed the expansion of inspector gen-
eral authority into allegations of at-
torney professional misconduct, which 
has always been handled competently 
by the Office of Professional Responsi-
bility. Judge Mukasey also relayed 
that he would be happy to testify at a 
hearing at a later date on such legisla-
tion. 
I share some of those same concerns 
raised about this bill, and I think at 
the very least we should have a hearing 
on what would be a significant change 
in the way the Department polices alle-
gations of attorney misconduct to 
study its relevance and its impact. 
I want to note that the Office of Pro-
fessional 
Responsibility 
historically 
has conducted its investigations with 
integrity and competence. I did not 
hear any allegations to the contrary 
today either. That is in part because it 
is composed of attorneys—both former 
prosecutors and former defense attor-
neys—who have decades—decades—of 
experience and a special expertise in 
legal ethics rules and the many com-
plicated decisions any Department at-
torney makes in the process of charg-
ing grand jury proceedings or jury 
trials. The inspector general and his in-
vestigators simply do not have that ex-
pertise. 
The 
inspector 
general 
is 
charged 
with 
investigating 
waste, 
fraud, and abuse. 
We also heard some today about inde-
pendence and alleged conflicts of inter-
est. I have to say I am also concerned 
that this bill would create a serious 
conflict of interest itself if the inspec-
tor general is given broad authority to 
investigate allegations of attorney pro-
fessional misconduct. 
The inspector general can and does 
refer criminal matters to Department 
prosecutors. Let’s say a prosecutor de-
clines to prosecute one of these refer-
rals. An inspector general could then 
come up with any reason to investigate 
that prosecutor. 
I think we all agree that the deter-
mination of who will be prosecuted or 
not be prosecuted lies with and must 
constitutionally lie with the Attorney 
General and that the inspector general 
should not be able to influence who is 
prosecuted or not prosecuted with the 
looming threat of potential investiga-
tion. 
I, of course, as the Senator from Iowa 
said, do not want to see a government 
of the bureaucrats. But I would point 
out that the inspector general is a bu-
reaucrat. The Attorney General is a po-
litically accountable officer of the 
United States. 
I also have concerns that this bill 
could empower criminals. 
Criminals can additionally use the 
inspector general to try to harass Fed-
eral prosecutors by making unfounded 
targets of Federal investigations. With 
the wrong inspector general and with 
the wrong political climate, a career 
prosecutor could be under pressure by 
leftwing jailbreak advocates into drop-
ping cases against violent criminals,

pursuing cases against police officers 
who have broken our laws. It is not 
surprising that this bill is supported by 
leftwing groups such as the ACLU, De-
mand Progress, and the Brennan Cen-
ter. 
The inspector general could easily 
weaponize professional misconduct in-
vestigations also to defeat anti-crime 
policies the executive branch chooses 
to pursue. Imagine, for instance, an in-
spector general who refused to dismiss 
allegations of racism when the U.S. At-
torneys’ 
Office 
simply 
chooses 
to 
prioritize gun prosecutions in high- 
crime areas. Such investigations have 
a chilling factor, of course, on other of-
fices for prioritizing similar prosecu-
tions. 
We also heard some about trans-
parency. But I would note this bill does 
not necessarily provide more trans-
parency, because, just like the Office of 
Professional Responsibility, the inspec-
tor general is governed by the Privacy 
Act, rules pertaining to grand jury ma-
terials and court orders sealing docu-
ments. This bill would not change that. 
If it is punishment and sanctions 
that the bill is concerned about, I 
would also note that the Office of Pro-
fessional Responsibility is not respon-
sible for the legal level of discipline 
imposed. That falls, instead, to the 
Professional Misconduct Review Unit, 
the unit created by then-Attorney Gen-
eral Eric Holder in 2014. Expansion of 
inspector general jurisdiction would 
not change where that responsibility 
falls. 
I, of course, share concerns with my 
colleagues about politically motivated 
prosecutions or prosecutions pursued 
by so-called glory seekers. But I do not 
want to proceed down a path where we 
unintentionally exacerbate the very 
problem we are trying to solve. There-
fore, Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. I am disappointed by 
the objection by the Senator from Ar-
kansas. 
This has overwhelmingly bipartisan 
support in the House and in the Senate, 
and we had an opportunity to make 
history today and we missed that op-
portunity for the moment. 
The suggestion that inspectors gen-
eral are not up to the job of inspecting 
attorneys, I am afraid if you look at 
the fact that every other Federal Agen-
cy’s lawyers are subject to review and 
scrutiny by the inspector general of 
their departments, it certainly says 
that particular observation is not accu-
rate. 
The argument that the Attorney 
General, because he is approved by the 
President directly and by Congress, 
should be the person to make this deci-
sion overlooks the obvious. Each in-
spector general goes through the ap-
proval process, the nomination process, 
and advise and consent of the Senate. 
So they are subject to the same level of 
scrutiny. 
I might also add that what we are 
suggesting has been an evolution that I 
think really calls for this change that 
we have asked for in this measure. In 
the course of that evolution, in the 
year 2002, the inspector general’s re-
sponsibilities were extended within the 
Department of Justice to apply to both 
the FBI and DEA agents who are in-
volved, obviously, in significant law 
enforcement operations within the De-
partment. The inspector general has 
handled that responsibility without 
jeopardizing any prosecutions. So I 
think that argument is certainly a 
weak argument when you look at the 
facts since 2002. 
We will return with this. I am glad to 
have bipartisan support of Senators 
LEE and GRASSLEY, who will have more 
to say on the subject. 
I believe if we are going to apply this 
standard of IG responsibility for law-
yers’ activity across Federal Govern-
ment, there is no reason to make an 
exception for the Department of Jus-
tice. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I agree with 
and echo the observations made by my 
friend and distinguished colleague, the 
Senator from Illinois. I would like to 
add a couple of things in response to 
the observations and remarks pre-
sented by the Senator from Arkansas. 
One of the points that he made that 
I feel compelled to respond to is he ex-
pressed concern about what he de-
scribes as potential weaponization of— 
I feel compelled to respond, in par-
ticular, to his argument that the In-
spector General Access Act could re-
sult in the weaponization of allegations 
of attorney misconduct within the De-
partment of Justice and that this could 
be used in circumstances to intimidate, 
threaten, and harass Department of 
Justice attorneys, including prosecu-
tors, for either taking or not taking ac-
tions in retaliation to the same. 
This is always a concern. It is a con-
cern that follows government, gen-
erally. It is, in particular, a concern 
that follows Federal prosecutors. It is 
also not a concern that is unique to the 
Inspector General Access Act. 
With or without passage of this, 
there is always a risk of that hap-
pening. Nothing about that risk that 
we immunize ourselves from by leaving 
intact the loophole—and it is a loop-
hole. It is a deliberate carve-out in 
Section 8E of the Inspector General 
Act. It is a loophole. And my friend 
from Arkansas is right, it is not unin-
tended. It is intentionally created. It 
was there for a reason. I don’t mean to 
suggest any nefarious motive on the 
part of those who created it, but it 
might have been a shortsighted move 
at the time. It has, at least, in time, 
exposed a vulnerability in Democratic 
and Republican administrations alike. 
If the risk is weaponizing allegations 
of professional misconduct against De-
partment of Justice lawyers, that is 
not something that we are immune 
from today. It is something that I am 
certain the Office of Professional Re-
sponsibility deals with all the time. It 
doesn’t mean we make ourselves more 
vulnerable to it. It is simply by allow-
ing the inspector general of the Depart-
ment of Justice to do his or her job 
without regard to who is a lawyer and 
who is not, and without regard to this 
special carve-out for this one Federal 
Agency that makes it different from 
every other Federal Agency, including 
what makes Department of Justice 
lawyers different from attorneys in 
every Federal Agency. 
If the risk is that you might have 
people who, for bad reasons, might 
make up allegations of misconduct, 
there is no more risk of that with an 
inspector general than there is with 
the Office of Professional Responsi-
bility. 
Here, again, they perform different 
functions. One of them is there specifi-
cally to deal with the rules of profes-
sional responsibility within the prac-
tice of law by Department of Justice 
lawyers. That is their focus. Their 
focus is not a broad one. Their focus 
does not include or extend to issuing a 
public report to inform the public 
about abuses of power. 
My friend from Arkansas is right. 
They can go in—if there are allegations 
of criminal misconduct and if they 
have evidence of the same that they 
have to pursue—yes, they can do that. 
That doesn’t mean we don’t need an in-
spector general capable of doing the 
job of the inspector general. 
He also made the argument that 
there is no expertise among and be-
tween inspectors general with regard 
to handling allegations of attorney 
misconduct. If that is true, the same 
can be said of all other attorneys and 
all other departments. 
My friend from Arkansas does cor-
rectly point out that attorneys within 
the Department of Justice—at least 
some of them do—perform different 
functions than what we see from attor-
neys in other Federal Agencies. That 
part is true. But that doesn’t mean in-
spectors general assigned to the De-
partment of Justice don’t have the ex-
pertise necessary to investigate the 
types of allegations that they typically 
investigate. 
My friend from Arkansas also points 
out inspectors general tend to focus on 
allegations of waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Yes, this is absolutely true, and this is 
absolutely why we should not limit the 
access that inspectors general in the 
Department of Justice have to attor-
neys. Remember, this is a department 
that is all about law. It is focused on 
law. It is, therefore, not surprising that 
they have an unusual abundance of 
lawyers. 
You know what the Office of Profes-
sional Responsibility is not focused 
on—is not really their role; they are 
not involved in; they are not trained 
in—their focus is not on issuing public 
reports and informing the American

people of allegations of things like 
waste, fraud, and abuse, generally. 
They have a much narrower function 
and perform that function especially 
well. They perform it laudably, and 
they do a great job of doing it. 
It is not the same thing as an IG. We 
need IGs with access to visibility into 
the Department of Justice. We don’t 
have it now. We haven’t since 1988. 
Thirty-three years is long enough. 
Let’s close the 8E loophole and give the 
Department of Justice inspector gen-
eral the access needed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, do you 
hear what I hear? 
Before the prancing and pawing of 
each little hoof of Santa’s eight tiny 
reindeer will be heard on the roof, 
there is a joyful sound that denotes the 
coming of the yuletide season in just a 
few instantly recognizable notes. 
Of course, I am talking about Mariah 
Carey’s ‘‘All I Want for Christmas Is 
You.’’ While it has become a holiday 
classic, the song is taking on a whole 
new meaning this season. 
If, like Mariah, you don’t want a lot 
for Christmas and don’t care about the 
presents 
underneath 
the 
Christmas 
tree, this may be your year. That is be-
cause Bidenomics is causing every-
thing to be back-ordered, delayed, un-
available, or just plain unaffordable. 
Even Christmas trees are in short sup-
ply. So don’t be surprised if your only 
option to deck the halls this year looks 
like Charlie Brown’s sad little twig of a 
fir tree branch. 
Whether shopping at a store or on-
line, we are all experiencing it. With 
the cost of gifts up 20 percent and con-
sumer prices surging to the highest 
level in over 30 years, you are paying a 
ho ho whole lot more for a ho ho whole 
lot less; that is if you can even find 
what you are looking for. 
Perhaps the most telling sign of the 
times, the Dollar Tree—which had to 
discontinue selling some of its popular 
products due to cost constraints—is 
raising prices to $1.25. 
President Biden’s contribution to 
this year’s season of giving could best 
be summed up by an elf on an empty 
shelf. After all, the Biden administra-
tion has ignored, dismissed, and even 
contributed to the conditions causing 
these economic hardships. 
Speaking at the White House just 
last 
week, 
the 
President 
actually 
claimed his efforts have resulted in 
‘‘shelves across the country being well- 
stocked.’’ That may be true at his 
White House gift shop, but not in the 
stores in Iowa and across the country. 
The supply chain problem is such a 
mess, not even Rudolph with his nose 
so bright can guide all of the barges 
stuck at sea into port by Christmas 
night. 
The Democrats’ out-of-control spend-
ing spree and misguided economic poli-
cies, like paying people not to work for 
most of the year, have decreased both 
the availability of goods, as well as the 
value of the money in your wallet. 
For folks in Iowa and the rest of the 
Nation who are working longer hours 
due to labor shortages or just to keep 
up with the skyrocketing prices, this 
has created a real-life ‘‘Nightmare Be-
fore Christmas.’’ 
As a result, a record number of 
Americans say they won’t be buying 
gifts this year. But rather than ad-
dressing these concerns, ‘‘Bare Shelves 
Biden’’ is pushing his so-called Build 
Back Better Act, which itself is a 
Christmas tree bill adorned with some-
thing for every leftwing special inter-
est group and topped off with a massive 
$300 billion tax break for coastal elites. 
For those millionaires on their wish 
list who literally have everything, DC 
Democrats are wrapping up a generous 
tax cut worth nearly $17,000. To no 
one’s surprise, those benefitting the 
most from this tax giveaway live in or 
around the San Francisco Congres-
sional District represented by Speaker 
NANCY PELOSI; and the State of New 
York, home of the Senate majority 
leader. It is a lot like a plot twist to 
Charles Dickens’ classic, ‘‘A Christmas 
Carol.’’ 
But instead of learning to embrace 
the giving spirit of Christmas, Scrooge 
receives a tax handout paid for out of 
the pockets of essential workers strug-
gling to provide for their own families. 
What a bunch of humbug. 
Santa Claus, I don’t know if you are 
listening, but if you are, when you’re 
making your list and checking it twice, 
remember that President Biden prom-
ised taxpayers that his Build Back Bet-
ter plan costs zero dollars, doesn’t 
waste any money on tax breaks for the 
wealthy, and adds—you guessed it— 
zero dollars to the national debt. 
To no one’s surprise, that promise 
ended up being a fa-la-la-la-lot of ma-
larkey. The truth is the Biden bill 
costs $1.7 trillion, adds $376 billion to 
our debt and gives a huge tax cut to 
millionaires. 
While the President certainly de-
serves a stocking full of coal for break-
ing his promises to taxpayers, even 
coal is in short supply at the moment, 
and the price has soared to the highest 
level in more than 12 years. 
Other energy prices, whether to 
warm your home or fill up the gas tank 
of your car, are also up sharply. The 
President has done his part to limit 
fuel supplies by signing Executive or-
ders to further restrict access to oil 
and gas. 
After enduring nearly 2 years of mak-
ing sacrifices, folks should not have to 
now choose between heating their 
house, buying food for their families, 
or putting gifts under the tree. 
So rather than passing another one 
of President Biden’s budget busting 
bills, the best gift that Washington can 
give taxpayers is to keep this from 
being a blue Christmas and simply stop 
making matters worse. 
Folks who have worked hard all year 
desperately deserve a break from the 
economic pressures being caused by 
Bidenomics so they can enjoy some 
time with their families. And unlike 
last Christmas, we can once again re-
discover the true meaning of this holi-
day season by spending time with those 
we love the most, just like Mariah 
sings about, ‘‘Make my wish come true, 
all I want for Christmas is you.’’ 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, following on 
the Christmas season message that we 
just heard, this season is around the 
corner, and Democrats are scrambling 
very, very hard to deliver on their lib-
eral wish list before the end of the 
year. And that’s not a Christmas list 
that people—or an agenda that people 
are going to accept very well, from 
what I’ve heard about the opposition to 
the trillions of dollars that they are 
trying to spend. 
This grab bag of long-sought, new 
government programs is a top priority 
for Washington Democrats. Meanwhile, 
the bigger concern that I hear around 
Iowa is rising prices on everything 
from gas, to food, to home goods. 
Americans doing their holiday shop-
ping this year are finding items out of 
stock and, when in stock, paying far 
more for less. Even the Christmas tree 
is no exception. Christmas tree prices 
are up 30 percent. 
Overall, consumer prices were up 6.2 
percent on an annual basis in the 
month of October—a 31-year high. 
Economists polled by the Wall Street 
Journal expect November inflation to 
shoot up to 6.7 percent. Even some ana-
lysts are saying that it could be closer 
to 7 percent. 
Americans are experiencing the high-
est inflation in a generation. The last 
thing they need for Christmas is an-
other Democrat spending boondoggle 
further fanning the flames of inflation. 
They ought to listen to their own 
Democrat economists. Larry Summers, 
former Secretary of Treasury in the 
Clinton 
administration, 
Council 
of 
Economic Advisers in the Obama ad-
ministration, warning us in January, 
again in April, again in August, again 
in October, I saw on television. They’re 
pouring fires on the—gasoline on the 
fires of inflation. 
Unfortunately, unless our voices of 
reason within the Democratic Party 
prevail, that’s exactly what they are 
going to get, more inflation. Demo-
crats say there is nothing to worry 
about because—to quote Treasury Sec-
retary Yellen—their bill is, ‘‘fully paid 
for.’’ 
We know that’s not true. But even 
the 
Washington 
Post 
isn’t 
buying 
Yellen’s statement, and they said that 
by 
awarding 
the 
Secretary 
two 
Pinocchios for her comment. The re-
ality is Democrats pull every budget 
trick in the book in an attempt to 
cloak the reckless tax-and-spending 
spree with the illusion of fiscal respon-
sibility. 
However, even their budget sleight of 
hands fail to mask the upfront infla-
tionary pressures embedded in that

very bill. According to the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office—CBO, as 
we call it around here—their bill con-
tains hundreds of billions of dollars in 
deficit spending in each of the first 5 
years. 
That means that, regardless of what 
Democrats say, their bill will add to in-
flation pressures now when it matters 
most. Under honest assumptions, the 
deficit spending never stops. 
According 
to 
the 
Penn 
Wharton 
Budget Model, their analysis, if their 
spending proposals are permanent, as 
they intend, their plan would increase 
debt and deficits by more than $2 tril-
lion over 10 years. As a result, by 2050, 
government debt would be 24 percent 
higher, economic growth will be 3 per-
cent higher, and wages of the middle 
class would be 1.7 percent less than 
they would otherwise be. 
Now, they go by the bill, building 
back better. Sounds to me like all of 
this is building back worse. So I urge 
my Democratic colleagues to pursue 
and rethink the approach. Securing a 
near-term ideological win is not worth 
the risk of spurring unchecked infla-
tion, sapping the value of America’s 
hard-earned dollars. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mi-
nority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, one 
thing you can say for the Democrats 
so-called Build Back Better plan is 
that it provides a never-ending supply 
of bad proposals to talk about. And the 
bad Build Back Better measure I want 
to discuss today is Democrats’ plan to 
double the size of the IRS—yes, double 
the size of the IRS. 
The IRS is not exactly the most pop-
ular government Agency, and with 
good reason. The Agency has gained for 
itself a reputation for poor taxpayer 
service and, most seriously, for mis-
handling 
the 
confidential 
informa-
tion—taxpayer information it has ac-
cess to. 
In fact, the IRS was subject to a mas-
sive leak or hack of private taxpayer 
information mere months ago—infor-
mation that somehow ended up in the 
hands of advocates at ProPublica. And 
neither Treasury nor the IRS has pro-
vided meaningful followup about the 
data breach, much less any account-
ability. 
For months, Republicans on the Sen-
ate Finance Committee have pressed 
the administration for details about 
the breach of private taxpayer informa-
tion. I would have hoped by now that 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle would have shown similar concern 
for the privacy of the American tax-
payer. 
And who could forget the IRS scandal 
during 
the 
Obama 
administration, 
when the IRS targeted a number of or-
ganizations based on their political be-
liefs? 
Those are two notorious examples of 
IRS misconduct, but there are plenty 
of others. 
The Treasury Inspector General for 
Tax 
Administration 
has 
repeatedly 
found instances of IRS agents violating 
taxpayer rights. And then there is the 
Agency’s record of irresponsibility or 
incompetence, or both—losing track of 
laptops that may have contained sen-
sitive taxpayer information, rehiring 
employees who’d been fired for bad be-
havior, work delays due to a lack of 
simple printer maintenance, hanging 
up on taxpayers who call the IRS for 
information. 
Customer service departments, in 
general, can be frustrating, but at least 
at many companies you can reach an 
actual person in a fairly reasonable 
amount of time. If you call the IRS, 
you have a 1-in-50 chance of reaching a 
human being—1 in 50. 
I could go on, but suffice it to say 
that there are good reasons why Amer-
icans tend not to be big fans of the IRS 
and why they think this Agency al-
ready has too much power. 
But Democrats would like to double 
the size of the Agency. The Democrats’ 
bill would add 87,000 new IRS employ-
ees—87,000. That’s enough employees to 
fill an entire football stadium with 
some left over; 87,000 is more than the 
population of Rapid City, SD, the sec-
ond largest city in my home State. 
The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that increasing the size of the 
Agency in this way would result in sig-
nificantly higher audit rates of Amer-
ican taxpayers. Many of those audits 
would hit middle-income taxpayers and 
small businesses; in other words, indi-
viduals without easy access to an army 
of accountants to help them navigate 
the process and ensure that their 
rights are protected. 
Democrats’ primary reason for the 
IRS expansion is to raise revenue, to 
help pay for their partisan tax-and- 
spending spree. They claim that hiring 
all these new IRS agents and employ-
ees will allow them to close or reduce 
the tax gap—the difference between 
taxes owed and taxes paid. 
But there are a couple of problems 
with that. In the first place, it is ex-
tremely doubtful that they will be able 
to raise the money they claim they 
will be able to raise. In fact, the Con-
gressional Budget Office doesn’t even 
score hoped-for revenue from enforce-
ment since it considers the acquisition 
of that revenue to be so uncertain. 
And even if Democrats are able to 
raise a meaningful sum from increased 
enforcement, what exactly is it going 
to cost Americans for Democrats to re-
capture this money? 
Increased scrutiny and costly audits 
of law-abiding taxpayers. IRS intimi-
dation and harassment. 
And just in case anyone thinks I am 
exaggerating about that intimidation, 
I would note that a provision in the 
House version of the Democrats’ reck-
less tax-and-spending spree would re-
peal a measure requiring written ap-
proval of a supervisor before an IRS 
agent can access—or I should say, can 
assess any penalties. 
The provision was intended to pre-
vent overreaching IRS agents from 
threatening Americans with unjusti-
fied penalties. And it is hard to imag-
ine why Democrats are trying to repeal 
this measure if they are not trying to 
pave the way for much more aggressive 
IRS pressure and enforcement. 
And I haven’t even mentioned the 
provision that was in Democrats’ pro-
posal for a long time and which some 
Democrats, including the President’s 
Treasury Secretary and other adminis-
tration officials, would still—still—like 
to see included, and that’s a provision 
that would empower the IRS to snoop 
on the details of Americans’ bank ac-
counts. 
Under one version of this provision, 
the IRS would be able to sift through 
the bank records of any American with 
just $600 in annual transactions. In 
other words, the IRS would be able to 
look through the bank records of just 
about every American and find out just 
how much you spent on Starbucks or 
your last doctor’s bill or that new win-
ter coat. 
It is staggering that the Democrats 
could even contemplate giving that 
much power to an Agency that has a 
track record of mishandling sensitive 
taxpayer information. But that is the 
kind of power the President’s Treasury 
Secretary, for one, would like this 
Agency to have. 
With their so-called Build Back Bet-
ter plan, Democrats are proposing a 
massive expansion of government, and 
we are apparently just supposed to 
take it on faith that the government 
will be able to handle all these new re-
sponsibilities. 
Well, I have to say, I—and I would 
say many other Americans—have my 
doubts. And the IRS provides a perfect 
example of why. 
The IRS can’t even properly handle 
the staff and responsibilities it already 
has, and yet Democrats think it is a 
good idea to double the size of this 
Agency and give it new enforcement 
powers and, if some have their way, ex-
panded access to Americans’ personal 
information. 
Doubling the size of the IRS is a ter-
rible idea, and it is one more reason 
why Build Back Better is a bad deal for 
the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, when the 
Grinch stole Christmas, it was a rel-
atively simple operation, one that re-
quired a relatively simple solution. 
Unfortunately, cold, unfeeling regu-
lations and entrenched bureaucracies 
do not have undersized hearts; hearts 
that can somehow grow three sizes. 
Protectionist laws and labor support 
shortages do not warm to holiday 
cheer. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has caused 
our already deeply troubled economy 
problems, and it has caused our already 
deeply troubled supply chain to become 
mired with challenges of all sorts, in-
cluding truckdriver shortages, out-
dated port technology, lack of con-
tainer storage capacity, port labor dif-
ficulties, and scarce freight equipment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9068 
December 9, 2021 
In fact, as situations become more 
dire with the supply chain crisis, with 
inflation, and with shortages all over 
the country, our own regulations do a 
whole lot to delay and disrupt solu-
tions that we need the most at the 
time we most need them. 
Americans are feeling the pain of 
skyrocketing prices, of shipping delays, 
and empty shelves as our laws and bu-
reaucracies fail to respond to shipping 
backlogs and labor shortages. The sys-
tem just is not working. And President 
Biden’s press release policies have not 
fixed it. In fact, they have made it 
much, much worse. 
Like so many problems during his 
Presidency, President Biden is not 
touching them with a 391⁄2-foot pole. 
As the holidays are here, we see the 
problems continuing to mount. And 
these problems needed solutions many, 
many months ago, but there is still 
hope. My STOP the GRINCH Act can 
help us fix the supply chain crisis and 
save Christmas. 
This is a bill that focuses on the 
problems that are actually slowing 
down our supply chain, and it is a bill 
that, if enacted, would get products off 
of ships, onto trucks, and into stores so 
that people in Utah and across the Na-
tion could get the things they need for 
everyday life and especially for Christ-
mas. 
By suspending a number of Federal 
restrictions on ports, on ships, and on 
trucks, we can help clear the backlog 
at our ports, get products onto shelves, 
and get the presents under the trees. 
The bill will help solve our truck-
driver shortage by temporarily low-
ering the commercial driver license age 
to 18 for interstate travel, and it would 
waive for 1 year the hours-of-service re-
quirements, specifically, for those in-
volved in transporting containers into 
and out of ports. 
The bill would allow for more ships 
to move more freely and to move cargo 
between American ports by waiving the 
Jones Act, and it would also allow for 
Federal land that has been designated 
as appropriate for multiple use to be 
used to temporarily store cargo con-
tainers. That would do a lot in and of 
itself to help us break our port log-
jams. A combination of these things 
would do so masterfully. 
And, finally, my bill would help ease 
the lack of freight equipment by allow-
ing 
excess 
Department 
of 
Defense 
equipment to be used to help move 
cargo. A lot of our problems can be 
traced to a lack of available truck 
chassis, and if we open up those that 
are deemed excess, we can do a lot to 
move freight. 
While this bill doesn’t address every 
challenge with our supply chain, it 
does provide tangible solutions that, if 
enacted into law, would solve real 
problems right now. 
Look, we can end this nightmare be-
fore 
Christmas. 
We 
can 
stop 
the 
Grinch, save our holidays, and secure 
our economy. 
My STOP the GRINCH Act is the 
start to a merry Christmas and a happy 
new year. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida is recognized. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, we are less than 3 weeks away 
from Christmas, and Joe Biden has run 
this country into the ground. 
I know President Biden thinks that 
Santa can solve his problems, but our 
supply chain is such a mess not even 
Santa Claus, with all of his Christmas 
magic, can fix it. 
There are nearly 100 ships waiting to 
dock in California ports. About 40 of 
them are a few miles off the coast, but 
more than 50 are holding back farther 
in the Pacific. It looks to me like the 
Biden administration didn’t like the 
visual. 
I recently received a letter from a 
grandmother in New Smyrna Beach, 
FL. She is retired now but was a small 
business owner who has spent her life 
working hard to support her kids and 
grandkids. 
I have the letter with me. In her let-
ter she writes: 
I am worried about inflation. I see prices of 
fuel, groceries, and staples going through the 
roof. I see the American standard of life de-
clining. It is getting harder and harder for 
families to make ends meet, buy a home, af-
ford medical care and higher education for 
their children. 
She also tells me that Joe Biden’s 
unconstitutional vaccine mandate is 
putting her husband at risk of losing 
his job, despite the fact that he worked 
throughout the pandemic as an essen-
tial worker. 
She is not alone. She shares the 
exact same concerns as millions of 
Americans and businesses right now 
that are reeling from the impacts of 
Biden’s socialism. 
The Pantry of Broward County, FL, 
usually supplies meals to 500 families 
each month, but they weren’t able to 
donate as many Thanksgiving turkeys 
this year because of skyrocketing 
prices. 
And there are other terrible stories 
in the news across my State every day. 
I heard about a single father of three 
in Clearwater, FL, who lost his job due 
to COVID, and at his new job he is hav-
ing to stretch each dollar as far as it 
can possibly go as prices for meat, 
food, rent, everything goes up and up 
and up. 
I heard about a woman who delivers 
groceries in South Miami. She is seeing 
prices going up and having to send pic-
tures of empty shelves to her online 
customers to show grocery stores are 
out of so many products. She can hard-
ly ever find any juice boxes for her own 
children. 
These are the stories of real Florid-
ians, and I could keep going because 
Florida families and families all across 
our great country are struggling as 
Biden’s inflation and supply chain cri-
sis rages on. 
Now, most people, when they are in 
charge, they want to do something 
positive when a problem arises. When 
the families are struggling, leaders 
should want to solve a problem. 
What is shocking is that even as 
ships wait in docks, in ports—wait to 
dock in ports and families are forced to 
count their pennies and sometimes 
even go without certain products, the 
Biden administration is doing abso-
lutely nothing. 
Secretary Raimondo and Secretary 
Buttigieg would rather play TV com-
mentator than actually travel to Cali-
fornia and solve some of these prob-
lems facing our distributors. Instead of 
coming to the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee to testify about what actions 
they are actually taking, they would 
rather stay silent. If they don’t want to 
show up and do the job they signed up 
for, I have heard there is an opening at 
CNN. 
Energy prices are up, and families 
who are simply trying to stay warm 
during the winter season are going to 
face higher bills, just as gas prices and 
food prices continue to climb. 
The American people are fed up with 
President Biden’s utter lack of leader-
ship. Time and time again, I have come 
to the floor to try to get some informa-
tion about this crisis, but Senate 
Democrats have stood in the way. 
When I came down to demand notes 
from internal meetings the Biden ad-
ministration held about the signs of in-
flation they were seeing, Democrats 
blocked—blocked—it. When I walked 
down here to request a report about 
the factors causing the energy prices to 
rise, Senate Democrats blocked it. 
When I came down here to pass bi-
cameral, commonsense legislation that 
would alleviate the supply chain crisis 
facing our ports, Senate Democrats 
blocked it. 
This isn’t how Washington should be 
working. I came here to make Wash-
ington work for Florida families, but 
Democrats in this body are joining 
hands with the White House to insti-
tute policies that make life more dif-
ficult and more expensive. 
This isn’t government for the people; 
this is Big Government that hurts the 
people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, in 
case anyone was wondering, there are 
16 days left before Christmas—16 shop-
ping days. 
Now, I know I still have some shop-
ping to do, and I look forward to that, 
but it seems as though some of my col-
leagues have a jump on me. Seems as 
though President Biden has a jump on 
me, and that is good thinking because 
this year you can’t start too early, 
with the supply chain as bad as it is 
and the price of presents rising. 
So why don’t we gather around the 
Christmas tree to see what gifts na-
tional Democrats are prepared to pass 
out on Christmas morning, thanks to 
their reckless tax-and-spending spree. 
To the leftwing labor unions, what do 
they offer? Democrats are gifting bil-
lions 
of 
dollars 
in 
handouts 
to 
strengthen this core constituency of

theirs. While they are letting chari-
table deductions expire in Build Back 
Better, they have gift wrapped an 
above-the-line tax deduction for union 
dues. 
Let’s see what we have here. 
Well, that is a car. That is a car. And 
this is the labor union present. Hmm. 
As a special Christmas surprise, it 
seems that the Democrats have put 
under the tree a shiny new tax credit 
for electric vehicles but only if those 
vehicles are made in a union shop— 
only a union shop. 
You see, if you are naughty, and you 
buy an electric vehicle from a non-
union shop, like those that are made in 
my State of Indiana, you will miss out 
on the Democrats’ $4,500 holiday give-
away in this bill. Apparently, during 
the Christmas season, the impact of 
electric vehicles on climate change 
only matters if the workers’ contracts 
are collectively bargained. 
Which brings us to another gift we 
have, and that is China. China has a 
gift under the tree. Why don’t we just 
open this China gift. Well, that is a lot 
of money. The tax hikes on businesses 
large and small in this bill will give 
China an unfair competitive advantage. 
Increasing taxes on American employ-
ers by more than $800 billion, when 
they are already struggling with sup-
ply chain issues and worker short-
ages—this is going to do very little to 
bring jobs back home, jobs of the fu-
ture here in the United States of Amer-
ica, which is exactly why the Chinese 
Communist Party and all of its leaders 
will love this very expensive gift. 
And the largest gift under the Wash-
ington Democrats’ tree goes to—is 
that—could that be? It says ‘‘the rich.’’ 
I am going to see what is in there. 
Well, this must mean—it says SALT. 
By dramatically increasing the cap on 
the State and local tax deduction, or 
what is known around here as SALT 
for short, the once-proud party of the 
working class is giving a tax cut to 
two-thirds of people earning more than 
$1 million a year. Now, the average size 
of that tax cut is almost $17,000 a year 
for millionaires. This is the new Demo-
cratic Party. 
Merry Christmas. This is the single 
most expensive tax expenditure in the 
Build Back Better Act, and it is the 
second biggest component of the entire 
bill. 
So, evidently, the national Demo-
crats believe it is better to give than to 
receive from millionaires so they pro-
posed a tax cut for the wealthiest 
Americans from the wealthiest cities 
in the wealthiest States, gift wrapped 
from the Democratic Party. 
So after the handouts and giveaways 
and entitlements and earmarks, what 
is left for regular, middle-class work-
ing stiffs? 
Well, we know that really big gifts 
come in smaller packages. So I see this 
stocking here that says ‘‘taxpayers’’ on 
it. Let me see what is in here. 
Oh, my word. That looks like coal— 
a lump of coal. That lump of coal must 
represent the massive $367 billion that 
will be added to the debt by the Demo-
crats’ reckless tax-and-spending bill, 
according to the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office, not to mention 
the 10 years of tax increases included 
in the bill to pay for only a few years 
of policy changes. 
Of course, we all know that figure is 
going to be much higher in reality. If 
all the temporary provisions in this 
bill are made permanent, it will in-
crease our budget deficit by nearly $3 
trillion in this decade. It seems the 
Democrats 
want 
our 
children 
and 
grandchildren to pay for this bundle of 
goodies through the layaway plan. 
GDP is expected to fall because of 
Build Back Better. The cost of living is 
expected to rise even more because of 
Build Back Better. And despite the 
promises of President Biden and my 
Senate Democratic colleagues, despite 
their votes right here on this floor, if 
Build Back Better were to become law, 
taxes would be raised on lower and 
middle-class Americans who are just 
trying to get by this Christmas season. 
Ho, Ho, Ho. Ladies and gentlemen, 
boys and girls, this Christmas season 
Democrats are not offering holiday 
jobs or good cheer. Instead, this feels 
more like the nightmare before Christ-
mas. 
Colleagues, the best present that all 
of us can give the American people is 
to do whatever is in our power to stop 
the Build Back Better Act. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio is recognized. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
appreciate the comments of my col-
league from Indiana. What he didn’t 
have under that Christmas tree or in 
the stocking was a lump of coal be-
cause I guess a lump of coal is not 
something we would find in Build Back 
Better. Even though there is a lot of 
stuff in there that is really bad for our 
economy right now, bad for our fami-
lies, bad for our workers. And when you 
think about it, right now, we are in a 
time of high inflation, supply chain dif-
ficulties, record levels of debt and def-
icit, and an uncertain economy due 
largely to the uncertainty regarding 
COVID and particularly this variant, 
the Omicron. 
So this is not a time for us to be put-
ting forward a massive new spending 
bill and a massive new tax increase on 
the American economy. In fact, it is 
the time for us to retrench a little bit 
and try to help to get back to where we 
were before COVID–19. 
Remember, that was the time when 
after the 2017 tax reforms, we had a 
great economy, by any measure. And it 
was an opportunity time. It was the 
lowest poverty rate in the history of 
our country since we started keeping 
track in the 1950s. 
As of February, just before going into 
the COVID–19 period, February 2020, we 
had 19 straight months of wage gain of 
over 3 percent. By the way, that was 
over inflation because inflation was so 
low. So people were feeling it. They 
were actually getting a wage increase. 
In my State of Ohio, that was the first 
time in probably a decade and a half. 
Now, it is just the opposite. Wages 
are actually down when you take infla-
tion into account. And inflation is 
high, as everyone feared because we 
have dumped so much on the demand 
side of the economy, and the supply 
side is restricted, in part, because of 
what has happened with COVID, and it 
creates this inflation. This was warned 
by not just Republicans like myself, 
but back in March, when President 
Biden and the Democrats put $1.9 tril-
lion into this economy—the most ever, 
the biggest bill ever—it was Larry 
Summers, former Secretary of the 
Treasury under President Clinton, and 
NEC, 
National 
Economic 
Council, 
Chair under President Obama, who 
said: You know, this is going to stoke 
inflation. It is going to overheat the 
economy. 
And that is exactly what it did. 
So we have this high inflation. We 
have these record levels of debt and 
deficit. We are talking about extending 
the debt limit right now, and people 
think the number is going to be—just 
to extend it for about a year—over $2 
trillion; meaning that we are spending 
so much more than we are taking in. 
And yet there is this discussion that 
somehow before Christmas we are 
going to put forward this Build Back 
Better legislation that we just talked 
about. 
It is not building back America bet-
ter. Unfortunately, it is building us 
worse off than we were and adding to 
inflation, adding to the supply chain 
difficulties, adding to the debt and 
deficits at record levels, and certainly 
doing nothing with regard to COVID– 
19. 
So why would we do this? And cer-
tainly why would we do this now? It 
makes no sense. Well, because I guess 
there was a promise made that we are 
going to have this massive new spend-
ing and these massive new tax in-
creases. 
What is in there? Well, on the spend-
ing side, when you look at it, it is the 
largest spending bill ever put forward 
by the U.S. Congress, unless you be-
lieve that it is really only $1.7 trillion 
instead of two or three times that. In 
that case, it is the second biggest ever. 
But the analyses I have seen from the 
Penn Wharton study, from the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Budget, and 
from others said: You know, there are 
a lot of sunsets in there. 
As an example, the child tax credit 
lasts for 1 year. Does anybody believe 
it only lasts for 1 year? That wouldn’t 
be the history of this place. So it will 
continue. 
So these sunsets are not going to be 
effective so the spending will continue 
to increase. The tax increases don’t 
cover them so there will be a big gap 
accrued to the deficit, and the projec-
tions are it is more like $41⁄2 trillion in 
spending. So it is the largest increase 
in the history of our country by far.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9070 
December 9, 2021 
We are talking about doing this, 
again, at a time when already we have 
record levels of debt and deficit and 
high inflation and driven by COVID, a 
lot of uncertainty in our economy. 
On the tax side, I could argue it is 
even worse because the tax increases 
are going to be hard on workers be-
cause they are taxes on businesses. 
What the Joint Committee on Taxation 
says—which is the nonpartisan group 
here in Congress that advises us—what 
CBO says, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice says, what other outside groups 
say is the same thing, which is when 
you tax these businesses, who gets 
taxed? 
Well, 
it 
is 
workers—lower 
wages, lower benefits. 
Seventy percent of the benefit of our 
tax cuts in 2017 went to workers, and 70 
percent of this increase in taxes will be 
coming out of workers’ pockets. So it 
is a bad idea. But let’s look a little 
deeper at what these taxes actually 
are. There is a 15-percent minimum 
tax—a new alternative minimum tax, 
which is always complicated for every-
body to figure out what that is. But in 
this case, it is called the book tax. 
Now, I don’t know if this was on pur-
pose or not. I assume it wasn’t. But the 
book tax, as you apply it to our econ-
omy, will result in real damage to 
things that most people think are im-
portant like defined benefit plans, pen-
sion plans. Democrats and Republicans 
alike have supported defined benefit 
plans. I support them. Unfortunately, 
there aren’t as many as there used to 
be. But there will be even fewer if this 
passes. Why? Because when you cal-
culate your taxes under the book tax, 
you now have to take into account 
whatever your asset increase is in your 
pension. And if you are one of these 
companies caught up in this, you could 
well find yourself in a situation where, 
for the first time ever, you get no de-
duction for your contribution to your 
pension. Why would we do that? And 
then you are taxed on the asset in-
crease, which may be caused by higher 
interest rates, may be caused by the 
market going up, but you get no ben-
efit in your company, and your profits 
in your company may not be enough to 
pay those taxes. 
Here is an example of this. There are 
some companies that have figured out 
this problem. By the way, there are 
some unions figuring it out, too, be-
cause a lot of union workers are caught 
up in this as well because they have de-
fined benefit plans, typically. The com-
pany is saying: OK. If I make $100 mil-
lion in profit and if I have a $2 billion 
or $1 billion increase in my pension as-
sets and you apply a 15-percent tax to 
that, I am not going to have enough 
money to pay my taxes. 
So what are they going to do? Well, 
they could declare bankruptcy. They 
could get a loan, which again hurts 
workers. So that, I hope, is an inad-
vertent part of this, but that is in this 
legislation. 
Why do we want to hurt defined ben-
efit plans? 
I think it was an effort to say: OK. 
We are going to raise taxes, but we are 
going to do it in a sort of convoluted 
way so that it doesn’t look like we are 
really raising taxes. But it is real 
taxes, and it is going to hurt, again, 
workers in America. 
Another thing it would disqualify 
companies from doing is taking what is 
called bonus depreciation. All of us, I 
thought, were kind of supportive of 
that. 
In 2017, that tax bill, this put in place 
where you can immediately write off 
expansion of plant equipment. Retail-
ers love it, restaurants love it, and so 
do manufacturers. And they use it a 
lot. And those manufacturers are tell-
ing me: OK. Now, under the book tax, 
you have to go back to the regular de-
preciation so you are not writing 
things off that first year as you can 
now under bonus depreciation. Why 
would you want to do that right now, 
again, with all the economic uncer-
tainty out there, with COVID, with in-
flation fears? We want to encourage 
people to expand plant equipment, and 
there are a lot of people hesitating. 
That is in this legislation. 
Now let’s talk quickly about the 
SALT provisions. We already know 
what that is because it has gotten a lot 
of play. But the State and local tax de-
duction means that in States like 
mine, Ohio, we are subsidizing high-tax 
States. So if you are from Missouri— 
Senator BLUNT is here on the floor—or 
if you are from Ohio, by having a de-
duction for your State and local taxes 
at the Federal level, you are not only 
encouraging those States to continue 
to have high taxes and even have fur-
ther taxes if you are being subsidized 
by Federal taxpayers, but it is unfair 
to those States that have done the re-
sponsible thing to try to keep taxes 
under control. 
But in this legislation, Democrats 
say: No, we are going to increase this 
cap from 10,000 to 80,000 bucks a year; 
in other words, provide more help to 
the SALT beneficiaries. Guess what. 
There is an analysis out this week that 
says almost none of that benefit goes 
to Americans who are not in the top 10 
percent of wage earners. Almost none 
of that benefit that is in this bill goes 
to people not in the top 10 percent. 
There is $285 billion devoted to this— 
$100 billion more than is devoted to the 
cornerstone social safety net program, 
the childcare credit in this bill. Over 
$100 billion more for this. 
So how does this all shake out in 
terms of whom it is helping and whom 
it is hurting? 
Well, here are what the numbers are. 
This is, again, the Joint Tax Com-
mittee, folks who are nonpartisan, 
looking at this. Almost 70 percent—al-
most 70 percent—of people who make $1 
million or more a year are going to get 
a significant tax cut because of this 
legislation. 
Think about that. It is about 68 per-
cent-plus are going to get a significant 
tax cut if you make a million bucks a 
year. If you are a millionaire, you are 
going to do very well. 
If you make between $500,000 and a 
million bucks a year, 90 percent will 
get a tax cut under this legislation. 
But if you make $30,000 a year—only 
30,000—only 30 percent of people who 
make $30,000 a year are going to get tax 
relief under this legislation, and that is 
just in the first year. 
In the second year, it goes down 
below 30 percent to 12 percent; in the 
third year, 10 percent; and then it goes 
down to single digits. So the benefit is 
heavily skewed toward higher income 
Americans. Why would we do that? It 
just makes no sense. Are we worried 
about millionaires? But that is in this 
legislation. 
So, again, I would say, Build Back 
Better? I don’t think so. We were build-
ing pretty well when we had the lowest 
poverty rate in the history of our coun-
try, when we had the lowest unemploy-
ment rate ever for Blacks, Hispanics, 
the disabled, when we had 50-year lows 
in unemployment overall in our econ-
omy, when we had a situation where 
wages were going up—again, 19 straight 
months of 3 percent or more wage 
gains. It was real wage gains above in-
flation. 
Let’s get back to that. That is how 
you grow the opportunity economy. 
That is how you give people a chance. 
That is how you help everybody. 
But let’s not do this massive new 
spending bill that will cause more in-
flation, massive tax increases that are 
going to hurt the economy and hurt 
workers, especially coming into the 
holiday season. Let’s instead do some-
thing that gives the American people 
the gifts they deserve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri is recognized. 
Mr. BLUNT. I think we are a little 
beyond our time on this side, but I am 
grateful for my friend from Rhode Is-
land who is willing to let me have a 
chance to make the points I wanted to 
make. And I think, as is often the case 
here, many of them have already been 
made and were just made pretty well 
by Senator PORTMAN, certainly, in the 
spending bill he was talking about and 
the tax bill that he was talking about. 
We keep hearing that a majority of 
all Americans like these programs; 
that if they could just know what was 
in the bill, they would like the bill. We 
are going to have some time now over 
the next few weeks, I am confident, to 
talk about what is in the bill. These 
are programs that are supposed to 
make life better for everyday Ameri-
cans. Things like paid family leave, I 
am sure would be helpful in many, 
many cases. 
But what the Senator from Ohio was 
just talking about, you know, four 
times what this bill would spend on 
paid family leave it pays on tax cuts 
for the wealthiest families. 
When people begin to look at that, 
they are going to have to wonder, how 
is that priority established to where

the second biggest spending item in the 
entire bill would be tax cuts for the 
wealthiest families in America—$230 
billion of that $1.7 trillion is tax cuts 
for those families. The deductibility of 
State and local taxes goes from $10,000 
as a cap to $80,000 as a cap. 
Let me just repeat what I think I 
just heard, which was that 70 percent of 
this tax break—70 percent of that en-
tire $230 billion—goes to the top 5 per-
cent of all taxpayers; 94 percent goes to 
the top 20 percent; and 85 percent goes 
to the top 10 percent. 
Those are pretty big numbers in a 
bill that is supposed to make life easier 
for everyday American challenges. 
Now, I am sure the top 5 percent of 
all taxpayers have their own chal-
lenges. I am also sure they are dif-
ferent than my challenges, but they 
are not the challenges that everyday 
Americans face. It is pretty amazing, I 
think, in all the discussion of what this 
bill is designed to do, that that is what 
would happen. 
VACCINE MANDATE 
Madam President, let me talk about 
one other topic as I make way here for 
the Senator from Rhode Island. I want 
to talk a little bit about the vaccine 
mandate and what I am hearing about 
that. 
Yesterday, in a vote in the Senate on 
the Congressional Review Act, which is 
when we have an opportunity to look 
at regulations proposed by the admin-
istration, 52 Senators from both par-
ties—Senators from both parties made 
up that 52—voted not to go forward 
with this mandate. 
It is very possible to be pro-vaccine 
and not pro-mandate. I am pro-vaccine. 
Over and over again, I have rec-
ommended to my friends and my fam-
ily that you get the first shot and, now, 
if you are available for the booster shot 
after you have had either one or two of 
the other shots, to get that one too. 
The vaccines have made a big dif-
ference. Frankly, my advice would be, 
unless your doctor tells you you 
shouldn’t do this, I think you ought to 
do it. 
The mandate just appears not to be 
working. I am not even going to as-
sume it was designed in a way that the 
administration thought it would have 
the impact it appears to be having, but 
it is clear and it is out there. You know 
it, and I know it. 
I have visited with Missouri hospital 
administrators, and they may have 
been at a place where, just a few days 
ago, if that mandate had gone into ef-
fect, you couldn’t have gotten Medi-
care or Medicaid patients paid for at 
your hospital if you weren’t 100-percent 
vaccinated. 
Now, fortunately, a Federal court 
said: No, we are not sure the President 
has the authority to do that, so we are 
going to postpone that. 
But as we approached that deadline, I 
kept hearing more and more hospital 
administrators say: We think we can 
get almost all of our professional staff 
vaccinated, but we are not even sure 
about that. We are absolutely sure we 
can’t get 100 percent of the people— 
those who work in the cafeteria, who 
mop the floors, and who provide secu-
rity for the building—vaccinated. So 
we wouldn’t be able to participate in 
those programs, and that would create 
a serious problem, particularly in 
small, rural hospitals. 
There is the next mandate, the one 
for every group that has more than 100 
employees in it. All kinds of police offi-
cers, for whatever reason, either don’t 
want to get vaccinated or don’t want 
to be told they have to be vaccinated. 
You know, we have enough problems 
right now in finding police officers and 
firemen and first responders that, if 
you delete those forces, our current 
problems will be even bigger. That is 
what will happen. 
If you have got that 100-person force 
but you still want to be a police officer, 
in all likelihood, within driving dis-
tance, there is a 20-person police force 
or a 5-person police force. It may be a 
little easier, safer job anyway, and you 
will not have to be told by the govern-
ment what you have to do. 
I am hearing that from schools. We 
have schools where the National Guard 
is driving school buses. By the way, a 
lot of the people in the National Guard 
are thinking about leaving the Na-
tional Guard if they have to do some-
thing like this. 
You know, what people really, I 
think, resent is when government tells 
them: You have to do this, and you 
have to do it for your own good. 
If it is for your own good, that is 
probably a decision that you should be 
allowed to make. 
Whether you are allowed to make it 
or not, this is the response to all of 
these mandates, whether it is the 
Health and Human Services mandate 
on hospitals; the mandate on Federal 
contractors—and, by the way, we need 
those 
Federal 
contractors 
or 
we 
wouldn’t have contracted with them— 
or the mandate on policemen and fire-
men and grocery store workers. 
I saw a number the other day of 50- 
some percent—I think it was 56 per-
cent—of the people who work in a gro-
cery store would rather work some-
where else after what they have gone 
through in the last year: shorthanded; 
more people getting food at the grocery 
store than ever before. They are look-
ing for a reason to say: OK. I am done 
with this. 
We need our grocery store workers. 
We need our healthcare providers. We 
need our policemen. We need our fire-
men. We need our school bus drivers. 
We need our schoolteachers. 
This is not working. Fortunately, up 
to now, Federal judge after Federal 
judge has said: We don’t think you 
have the authority to do this, and we 
are going to suspend the implementa-
tion of these mandates. 
I think this gives the Biden adminis-
tration a chance to look at this again 
and realize that the unintended con-
sequences of what they were trying to 
do might be more significant than the 
consequences of what would happen if 
you forced compliance. 
I thank my friend for giving us a few 
extra minutes. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, it is a pleasure, and I appreciate 
my friend, Senator BLUNT. 
I am here today to rise for the 10th 
time to talk about the rightwing 
scheme to capture our Supreme Court. 
As the Presiding Officer knows, I 
have delivered a lot of speeches on the 
Senate floor, and a majority of them— 
279 of them, to be precise—addressed 
climate change. These were my ‘‘Time 
to Wake Up’’ speeches, many of which 
focused on the network of phony front 
groups and trade associations used by 
the fossil fuel industry to block any 
meaningful climate legislation. 
That vast web of climate denial and 
climate obstruction is one of the main 
reasons that we are in the climate cri-
sis we face today. I am here today to 
report that there is common technique 
behind that smelly climate denial oper-
ation and the rightwing donor oper-
ation to capture the Court. 
They both rely on massive amounts 
of dark money. They both rely on a 
small number of ultrawealthy donors 
who supply that dark money. And they 
both rely on an armada of front groups 
and phony corporate entities, funded 
by those big donors, to hide their 
hands. At this point, it is, actually, de-
pressingly, familiar. 
But it is worse than just common 
technique. It is the same entities: the 
Koch operation, Americans for Pros-
perity, DonorsTrust, the Bradley Foun-
dation, the Scaife Foundation, the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute, the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The list 
goes on and on and on. These are the 
exact same players on both sides of the 
operation—on the climate-denying web 
and on the Court-capturing scheme. 
My colleagues and I showed in a 
number of Web of Denial climate 
speeches 
how 
a 
few 
ultrawealthy, 
rightwing foundations, corporate trade 
groups, and so-called donor-advised 
funds supply the bulk of the dark 
money for modern-day climate denial. 
Big oil companies used to do that di-
rectly, but they got burned and learned 
that it is bad for their public image, 
and I suspect they are hiding now be-
hind those anonymizing entities and 
trade groups. 
The big funding guns included the 
Koch network; the Lynde and Harry 
Bradley Foundation; the Searle Free-
dom Trust; the Sarah Scaife Founda-
tion; Donors Capital; and DonorsTrust, 
which has been called the rightwing’s 
‘‘dark money ATM.’’ 
This is the Web of Denial graphic 
that we used in many of those Web of 
Denial speeches, and you will see these 
groups turning up over and over again. 
They are central in the web of climate 
denial.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9072 
December 9, 2021 
Now, if you look at the big funders 
behind the scheme to capture the 
Court, you will see this—in my last 
scheme speech, I talked about the flo-
tillas of amici curiae—or ‘‘friends of 
the court’’—who come in and orches-
trate phalanxes to file briefs for the 
rightwing in cases of significance to 
the scheme’s big donors. Well, it turns 
out that those funders also inhabit the 
web of denial. 
This is an appendix that I filed in the 
case of Seila Law v. Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau—a case that 
was the rightwing’s shot at weakening 
a consumer watchdog agency they 
hate. This appendix—a first of its kind 
in the Supreme Court, which was at-
tached to my amicus brief—looked at 
some of the other amici who had filed 
briefs and cross-referenced where their 
funding had come from. 
My point then was that the Court 
was not told that there was this huge 
overlap of funding. Each brief came in 
as if it were independent rather than 
part of an orchestrated cascade. So 
nearly every one of these groups is part 
of the web of denial: DonorsTrust, Do-
nors Capital, the Charles Koch Founda-
tion, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the 
Bradley Foundation, the Searle Foun-
dation. 
But the overlay isn’t just with the 
phony amicus flotillas that are orches-
trated up at the Supreme Court; it is 
right in the cases themselves. Take the 
notorious anti-labor cases of Friedrichs 
and Janus. According to a trove of doc-
uments uncovered in 2016, legal groups 
funded by the Bradley Foundation 
brought those cases. They weren’t just 
amici filing briefs; they were the liti-
gating law group in those cases. The 
law group went out and found the 
plaintiffs—plaintiffs 
of 
convenience, 
and they paid the plaintiffs’ legal ex-
penses. Those same donors, Bradley has 
shown in this, funded that whole boat-
load of amici who came in to support 
their also-funded group that was bring-
ing the case on behalf of a nominal 
plaintiff. By the way, they funded a flo-
tilla of amici in Janus. Seventeen Su-
preme Court amicus briefs came from 
groups funded by DonorsTrust, Donors 
Capital, and Bradley. 
The front groups in those labor cases 
actually played a little bit of switch-
eroo amongst themselves. Think of the 
pea-and-shell game. The group that 
brought the case in Friedrichs became 
an amicus supporting the plaintiff in 
Janus. The group that brought the case 
in Janus had been an amicus sup-
porting the plaintiff in Friedrichs. All 
of those groups—the ones that brought 
the two cases and the groups that 
chimed in as amici—were funded by the 
same organizations. It is a little bit 
like that pea-and-shell game except, if 
you know the parties, it is being played 
with transparent shells; but for some 
reason, the Court is incapable of notic-
ing this scheme that is being pulled in 
plain view, in their presence. 
Now, some front groups are invented 
shells—purpose built—just to hide who-
ever is behind them. Others are pre-
existing, captured, and co-opted. The 
key common characteristic, whether 
invented or captured and co-opted, is 
that they got to hide the donors. The 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the easy 
example of a captured and co-opted 
group. 
According to the watchdog group 
InfluenceMap, the Chamber is one of 
the biggest climate obstructors in 
Washington. 
Why? 
The Chamber has lots of members 
who don’t support climate obstruction, 
but 
someone—someone—gave 
the 
Chamber enough money to become a 
worst climate obstructor. And guess 
what. The Chamber is also a major 
player in the scheme. It is the biggest 
filer of scheme amicus briefs; it cam-
paigned hard for all three of Trump’s 
dark money-chosen Supreme Court 
Justices; and way back, it commis-
sioned the Lewis Powell memo that 
launched the entire scheme. 
Other major front groups serving 
both the web and the scheme include 
the Heritage Foundation, the Cato In-
stitute, and the Competitive Enter-
prise. 
Again, the common thread? 
They all hide the donors so they can 
provide 
that 
vital 
screening, 
anonymizing function, which is key to 
the donors because they have to hide 
their identities and their motives in 
order to do their dark work. 
On the scheme side, each one of these 
groups gets gobs of scheme dark 
money, helps hatch hot-house legal 
theories to present to scheme Justices, 
helps locate plaintiffs of convenience 
to bring cases for and/or joins the or-
chestrated flotillas of scheme amicus 
briefs. You see the same players over 
and over and over again, and how the 
Court manages not to notice or be curi-
ous is a mystery. 
On the web side, each is also a cen-
tral node in the web of denial. Here, for 
instance, is the Lynde and Harry Brad-
ley Foundation. Here is the Donors 
Trust, Donors Capital. Here is Koch-af-
filiated foundations. Here is Searle 
Freedom Trust. Here is the Americans 
for 
Prosperity 
Foundation. 
These 
groups pretty notoriously represent 
the interests of Big Business and right-
wing donors, so you at least know that 
much, if not the specific identity of 
who is funding the brief. But some of 
the web-scheme overlay gets a little 
bit harder to unravel, so let’s drill into 
one: the Independent Women’s Forum. 
This group was founded by rightwing 
donors in the very early days of the 
scheme to prop up the troubled nomi-
nation of Justice Thomas. It has ac-
cepted millions of dollars from a who’s 
who of scheme and web-of-denial do-
nors—Bradley, Scaife, Koch, Donors 
Trust. Its stated mission is to ‘‘im-
prove the lives of Americans by in-
creasing the number of women who 
value free markets and personal lib-
erty,’’ but its real mission is to pop up 
anytime its dark money donors want 
to trot out a front group purporting to 
represent women. In practice, that 
means they pop up everywhere. They 
popped up in a pending Second Amend-
ment case before the Court. They 
popped up in the Americans for Pros-
perity Foundation case that granted a 
constitutional right to dark money, 
signed off on by the dark money Jus-
tices. They popped up in the Little Sis-
ters of the Poor contraception case. 
They popped up in a challenge to the 
EPA’s authority to regulate green-
house gases. 
The Independent Women’s Forum’s 
work in that EPA case brings the over-
lay between the web and the scheme 
into focus. 
In 2016, the forum joined the dark 
money amicus flotilla asking the Su-
preme Court to strike down the EPA’s 
Clean Power Plan, along with other 
web-scheme front groups like the Com-
petitive Enterprise Institute, the Texas 
Public Policy Institute, and other 
groups opposing the EPA. These par-
ties asked the Robert Court to stop the 
Clean Power Plan before it went into 
effect. Just days before Antonin Scalia 
died and their 5-to-4 majority evapo-
rated, the Republican Justices obliged. 
This was ‘‘shadow docket’’ work, for 
those of you following the Texas abor-
tion case ‘‘shadow docket’’ fiasco. 
In the EPA case, for the first time, 
the Court stepped in to stay a regula-
tion before it went into effect and be-
fore the lower court had a chance to 
weigh in. 
By the way, it was a purely partisan 
decision, with all the Republicans be-
hind it and none of the other Justices. 
Fast-forward to today. The Trump 
administration 
replaced 
the 
Clean 
Power Plan in 2018 with a Trump do- 
nothing, polluter-friendly rule. When 
the Biden administration came in, it 
completely abandoned the Trump do- 
nothing, polluter-friendly rule, so right 
now, there is actually no regulation to 
challenge. But the scheme has replen-
ished its dark money Court and super-
charged it with a sixth Justice. 
They are out to disable what they 
call the administrative state for the 
sake of their big donors, so they sued 
again, backed by familiar organiza-
tions—the Competitive Enterprise In-
stitute, the Texas Public Policy Insti-
tute, and other web-scheme groups—to 
ask, as they put it in their brief, that 
the Court ‘‘finish what it started when 
it stayed the [Clean Power Plan].’’ 
There is no regulation to challenge. 
Yet the Republicans on the Court took 
the case—so much for the ‘‘case or con-
troversy’’ principle of the Constitution. 
Now the Court, I guess, is going to 
make decisions based on what might 
happen. Where I come from, that is 
called an advisory opinion, which our 
Court is not supposed to do under the 
separation of powers. But the Fed-
eralist Society six on the Court are out 
for big game. The prize is to bring 
down the ‘‘regulatory state’’ alto-
gether, and where better than where it 
most helps the fossil fuel industry—the

industry lurking behind this web of de-
nial and likely also working behind the 
dark money that put the last Justices 
on the Court and likely also lurking 
behind the dark money millions that 
fund the Republican election groups. 
This Clean Power Plan challenge 
opens an avenue for scheme-appointed 
Justices to delight the donors behind 
both the scheme and the web. In the 
short term, it would hobble the EPA’s 
ability to combat climate change— 
something very much sought by vested 
interests in the fossil fuel industry. 
Over the long term, it would accom-
plish 
rightwing 
donors’ 
goal 
of 
kneecapping Federal Agency power 
across the board. 
For Donors Trust, the Chamber of 
Commerce, the Independent Women’s 
Forum, and dozens of other groups that 
link the web and the scheme, winning 
cases like this one means big wins for 
their big secret donors. 
To go back to my early speeches 
about the scheme, they are following 
Lewis Powell’s advice years ago to 
seize what he called the ‘‘most impor-
tant instrument for social, economic, 
and political change’’—the Federal ju-
diciary—and to control it with what he 
called ‘‘an activist-minded Supreme 
Court.’’ The scheme has captured the 
Court. The scheme’s captured Court 
will deliver for the web. It is the same 
donors and organizations behind both, 
and it has got to be cleaned up because 
this is not how courts are supposed to 
work. 
To be continued. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to support a 
number of our nominees for Ambas-
sadors and positions within the State 
Department. 
As the chair of the European Affairs 
Subcommittee, I am particularly con-
cerned about the number of openings 
we have in Europe for Ambassadors. 
I 
want 
to 
support 
today 
Mark 
Gitenstein, again, to be U.S. Ambas-
sador to the European Union; Kent 
Logsdon to be U.S. Ambassador to 
Moldova; Michael Murphy to be U.S. 
Ambassador 
to 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina; Clair Cronin to be U.S. 
Ambassador to Ireland; Denise Bauer 
to be U.S. Ambassador to France and 
Monaco; 
and 
Julissa 
Reynoso 
Pantaleon to be Ambassador to Spain 
and Andorra. 
Those are the Ambassadors in Europe 
whom I wanted to raise this afternoon, 
but I also want to raise concern about 
Rufus Gifford, who has been nominated 
to be Chief of Protocol for the Depart-
ment of State. 
As I said, I am chair of the European 
Subcommittee, so I have had the op-
portunity to attend the hearings for 
these nominees and to see just how 
qualified they are and how important 
to American foreign policy they are. 
Earlier this week, Victoria Nuland, 
who is an Under Secretary at the De-
partment of State, testified in front of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee that the U.S. foreign diplomacy 
is operating at quarter-power as a con-
sequence of the numerous holds that 
have been placed on ambassadorial ap-
pointments by just a few of our Repub-
lican colleagues. 
I have some maps here that I think 
really very vividly demonstrate the 
consequences of this inaction in the 
Senate. 
The first map shows where we have 
U.S. Ambassadors to Europe. You can 
see that anything blue is where we 
have Ambassadors. On this map, every-
thing from Spain to Ukraine, the 
United Kingdom, Iceland, Ireland—we 
have no U.S. Ambassadors approved in 
those countries. 
Compare that to what Russia and 
China have in terms of their diplo-
matic ability in Europe. The gold color 
is 
Russian 
Ambassadors, 
countries 
where Russia has their Ambassadors— 
virtually every country in Europe. Red 
is where China has its Ambassadors— 
virtually every country in Europe. 
Again, the United States, our Ambas-
sadors 
in 
Europe—it 
is 
basically 
empty. 
Finland, 
Sweden, 
Norway, 
Spain, France, Germany, Poland, Ire-
land, the EU—we are desperately in 
need of Ambassadors because right 
now, we have very little presence in 
Europe. 
This is happening at a time when we 
know there are significant challenges 
taking place in Europe, particularly in 
Ukraine, where Russia is threatening 
to invade Ukraine, its sovereign terri-
tory, again, and where we need—if we 
are going to be successful in responding 
to Russia—where we need to take a 
unified approach among our allies. We 
need to be working with the EU, with 
NATO, with all of our European allies. 
Yet, in most of the countries where 
we need to be working, we don’t have 
Ambassadors, and we don’t have Am-
bassadors because of opposition from 
just a few of our Republican colleagues. 
I see Senator CRUZ on the floor, so I 
know that he is going to be here to ob-
ject to my effort to move these. But 
this is the impact of what is happening 
as a result of the holds of Senator 
CRUZ. We can’t put our national secu-
rity in the hands of those people who 
don’t have the status of Ambassadors. 
We know that our Embassies are doing 
a great job in all of those countries. 
They are working hard. But it makes a 
difference to have someone who has 
been approved by the Senate, who has 
been nominated by the President, who 
has the rank of Ambassador. 
As I think about the challenges that 
are facing this country, I can’t think of 
anything that is more harmful to our 
foreign policy than deliberately ham-
pering this country’s ability to ad-
vance American interests on the inter-
national stage. 
I want to say a few words about each 
of these nominees before I move for 
unanimous consent. Again, I would like 
to begin with Mark Gitenstein, who 
has already served our Nation before. 
He was the U.S. Ambassador to Roma-
nia. He has spent over 25 years working 
on energy issues. And as we think 
about the negotiations that are hap-
pening around energy and Nord Stream 
2 in particular, which I know is a con-
cern for Senator CRUZ because it is a 
concern that I have, we don’t have an 
ambassador to the EU at the table for 
those 
discussions. 
Mr. 
Gitenstein’s 
nomination is critically important in 
responding to Russia’s weaponization 
of gas flows to Europe and strength-
ening the transatlantic alliance as we 
face escalating aggression from Russia. 
Similarly, Kent Logsdon’s nomina-
tion 
as 
Ambassador 
to 
Moldova 
couldn’t come at a more critical mo-
ment where Russia is, again, using en-
ergy there as a weapon. 
Maia Sandu—the newly elected, pro- 
EU, pro-reform President there—has 
every intention of steering Moldova, 
the poorest country in Europe, toward 
a better path, and she is looking west 
to do that. But, of course, she has al-
ready faced pressure from Putin and 
his cronies, who have threatened to 
weaponize gas flows into Moldova. 
We can’t allow Moldova to become 
the next Ukraine or the next Georgia, 
and we can only prevent that by con-
veying strong U.S. leadership to sup-
port its pro-European aspirations. 
I also want to say a few words on Mi-
chael Murphy’s nomination as Ambas-
sador 
to 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina. 
America played a critical role in bring-
ing peace to Bosnia through the Day-
ton Accords, but we are seeing now 
that peace and stability in Bosnia and 
unity in Bosnia are under increasing 
attack. 
Earlier today, I had a chance to meet 
with the Bosnian Foreign Minister, and 
I am seriously concerned by the dete-
riorating political situation there. It 
requires an expert career diplomat like 
Michael Murphy to provide the com-
manding leadership to help Bosnia 
through this moment. 
The same is true in Ireland. Claire 
Cronin’s nomination as Ambassador to 
Ireland is not just a symbolic gesture 
to a longstanding ally of the United 
States. Peace in Northern Ireland is 
hanging by a thread as the UK, Ireland, 
and the EU handle the fallout from 
Brexit. 
I was concerned by the release of a 
report on Tuesday which indicated that 
the paramilitary gangs embedded in 
Northern 
Ireland’s 
divided 
commu-
nities pose a ‘‘clear and present dan-
ger’’ of violence fueled by post-Brexit 
tensions. By stalling our confirmation 
of Ms. Cronin, we risk tarnishing our 
legacy in fostering peace in Northern 
Ireland 
through 
the 
Good 
Friday 
Agreement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9074 
December 9, 2021 
Of course, Denise Bauer’s nomination 
to France is necessary as the country 
prepares for national elections next 
year. These elections have significant 
implications for our bilateral relation-
ship, in addition to the role France will 
play in the EU and NATO. 
Similarly, Julissa Reynoso’s nomina-
tion to Spain requires swift confirma-
tion. Spain will host the Madrid Sum-
mit next year, where NATO will elect 
the next Secretary General and finalize 
the strategic concept. What happens in 
NATO is critical to America’s national 
security, and we want to have an am-
bassador on the ground there who can 
monitor what is going on with those 
talks, in addition to the other officials 
we need to send. 
Finally, Ambassador Rufus Gifford 
has been nominated to be the Chief of 
Protocol for the Department of State. 
He previously served as our Ambas-
sador to Denmark, where the Queen 
there acknowledged him for his meri-
torious service to the Kingdom of Den-
mark. His background and service will 
make him an excellent Chief of Pro-
tocol, and we urgently need him in 
place to assist Secretary Blinken. 
Combined, these nominations are all 
critical to immediate challenges facing 
our national security interests. 
With that in mind, Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that notwith-
standing rule XXII, the Senate proceed 
to executive session to consider the fol-
lowing nominations: Executive Cal-
endar Nos. 320, 440, 447, 448, 450, 454, and 
519; that the Senate vote on the nomi-
nations en bloc without intervening ac-
tion or debate; that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate; that any statements re-
lated to the nominations be printed in 
the Record; and that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action and the Senate resume legisla-
tive session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, you know, in Wash-
ington, there is always political rhet-
oric that goes around. The Senator 
from New Hampshire just moments ago 
described the Embassies in Europe that 
are missing Ambassadors. She said 
they are missing Ambassadors because 
of Republican objections, and she high-
lighted in particular Ukraine. 
I would like to point out there is 
some irony in her doing so because ac-
tually the reason there is no Ambas-
sador in Ukraine is because of one 
thing and one thing only: President 
Biden has not nominated anybody to 
serve as Ambassador to Ukraine. We 
are in December of the first year of his 
Presidency, and Biden has yet to name 
an ambassador. So there are no Repub-
lican holds, there are no Republican 
objections to an ambassador that Biden 
has not even named. 
In addition, there were multiple Am-
bassadors who have been named whom 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee has yet to hold a hearing on. 
For every one of those nominees on 
whom there hasn’t been a hearing, 
again, there are no Republican objec-
tions; it is simply that the Senate 
Democrats have failed to move forward 
with hearings. 
But there are a number of nominees 
who have been nominated and who 
have had hearings on whom I have 
holds. And we are here today once 
again because the Democrats in this 
Chamber have been unwilling to do the 
one thing that would stop Vladimir 
Putin 
from 
potentially 
invading 
Ukraine, which is sanctioning the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline and making sure 
that it never becomes fully oper-
ational. 
Now, Senator SHAHEEN, along with 
every other Senator in this Chamber, 
knows exactly why I have holds on 
these nominees. Right now, as we 
speak, over 100,000 Russian troops are 
massed on the border of Ukraine, wait-
ing to invade. And it is Joe Biden’s 
fault because it is a direct consequence 
of 
President 
Biden’s 
surrender 
to 
Vladimir Putin on Nord Stream 2. 
For those watching at home asking 
‘‘What is Nord Stream 2?’’ it is a pipe-
line being constructed from Russia to 
Germany to carry natural gas. Putin is 
building Nord Stream 2 to go around 
Ukraine because right now, Russian 
gas gets to Europe through Ukraine. 
Putin didn’t just wake up one day 
and decide to invade Ukraine; he has 
wanted to invade Ukraine for years. He 
did it in 2014, but he stopped short of a 
full invasion because he needed to use 
Ukrainian energy infrastructure to 
transport Russian gas to the European 
market. Ukraine’s energy infrastruc-
ture is their insurance policy against a 
Russian invasion. 
Nord Stream 2 is all about Putin 
building an alternative avenue to get 
Russian gas to Europe. So if Nord 
Stream 2 comes online, it leaves 
Ukraine exposed to Russian aggression. 
Just 2 years ago, we had a bipartisan 
consensus in the Senate that we needed 
to stop Nord Stream 2. Now, Senator 
SHAHEEN knows that well because she 
and I authored the legislation together. 
She and I worked together to get the 
support of Democrats and Republicans 
in the Senate and the support of Demo-
crats and Republicans in the House. 
The Cruz-Shaheen legislation sanc-
tioning Nord Stream 2 passed both 
Houses of Congress overwhelmingly 
and was signed into law. The Cruz-Sha-
heen legislation worked marvelously 
well, so well that Putin stopped con-
struction of Nord Stream 2 the day 
that President Trump signed our legis-
lation into law—not even a week later, 
not a month later, but the very day 
that our sanctions were signed into 
law. 
It was an incredible, bipartisan na-
tional security victory that we won to-
gether, and that victory continued for 
over a year. For over a year, Nord 
Stream 2 lay dormant on the bottom of 
the ocean, dead, until, unfortunately, 
Joe Biden became President. 
Almost from the moment of election 
day, Biden and the incoming adminis-
tration began projecting weakness to 
Russia and Putin, and to understand 
just how much that message was re-
ceived: Joe Biden was sworn in as 
President on January 20, 2021. Putin 
began building the Nord Stream 2 Pipe-
line again on January 24, 2021, 4 days 
after Biden was sworn in. 
In the Senate, I introduced legisla-
tion again in the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee that passed in the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee— 
in this Senate—with overwhelming bi-
partisan support to sanction Nord 
Stream 2 yet again. But this summer, 
the Biden White House made a political 
decision to surrender completely to 
Putin on Nord Stream 2, and President 
Biden waived the sanctions on Nord 
Stream 2. He did so overruling the rec-
ommendations of his own State De-
partment that argued that this pro-
tects U.S. national security interests, 
this stands up to Russia, and this pro-
tects Ukraine. The Biden White House 
didn’t care about any of that—over-
ruled it all. 
Then, unfortunately, Senate Demo-
crats lost their willingness to hold 
Biden to account. This is an issue on 
which Democrats and Republicans are 
agreed on the substance. But it can be 
difficult to stand up to a President of 
your own party, and on Nord Stream 2, 
Senate Democrats have not been will-
ing to do so. They were eager to do so 
when Donald Trump was in the White 
House, but when a Democrat was in the 
White House, suddenly their willing-
ness to stand up to the President evap-
orated. 
So the holds that I have placed are 
directly in order to try to force Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS to follow 
the law and stand up to Russia and 
stand up to Putin. 
So I will offer my colleague Senator 
SHAHEEN a deal that I have offered 
many times to the White House, to the 
State Department, to the Department 
of the Treasury, and to Senate Demo-
crats—a deal that if we, as the Senate, 
will impose sanctions on Nord Stream 
2, 
CAATSA 
sanctions—yet 
another 
Russia sanctions bill that both Senator 
SHAHEEN and I voted for, that we both 
advocated and supported, and that the 
Biden administration is refusing to 
apply—if the Senate will impose those 
sanctions, I will happily, enthusiasti-
cally lift my holds on these nominees, 
and Senator SHAHEEN can take her map 
of Europe and color in all of those 
countries. We can do that right now by 
doing the right thing substantively. 
By the way, this is the one step 
which has a real possibility of stopping 
a Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
This past weekend, the Biden admin-
istration declassified their own inter-
nal projections that an invasion is im-
minent; it could happen as soon as Jan-
uary or February. And if we see Rus-
sian tanks in the streets of Kiev, it will

S9075 
December 9, 2021 
be because Joe Biden surrendered to 
Putin and Senate Democrats weren’t 
willing to hold him to account. 
I hope that is not the case. We can 
act right now to sanction Nord Stream 
2 to stop the pipeline from being oper-
ational, to stop Putin and the soldiers 
at the border to prevent the invasion, 
and to clear these ambassadorial nomi-
nees that my Democratic colleagues 
want. 
Accordingly, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 3322 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration; I further ask 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
The Senator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object. 
My colleague and I agree on our op-
position to Nord Stream 2, but I am not 
looking at it, despite your accusations, 
through the same partisan lens that 
you are, Senator CRUZ. 
And I would go back—I think you 
threw out a lot of red herrings in your 
initial objection there, one of which 
was to suggest that I said that you had 
a hold on our Ambassador to Ukraine, 
and I actually agree with you. I think 
this administration needed to appoint 
that Ambassador to Ukraine 8 months 
ago. 
And if you agree with me right now, 
then will you agree that you will not 
put a hold on the Ukraine nomination, 
once we get it—if we get it within the 
next couple of weeks, before the end of 
this year? 
I will ask you to think about that for 
a minute because I do think we need to 
have an Ambassador there. And that is 
certainly on my list of places in Europe 
where we need Ambassadors. 
But I think the bigger question now, 
you suggest that the mere action of 
sanctioning Nord Stream 2 would be 
enough to deter Putin and his ambi-
tions in Ukraine. Sadly, I think that is 
a simplistic analysis of the situation 
that we are in because the biggest de-
terrent we can provide right now to 
what Putin is thinking about is to let 
him know that we are united with our 
allies in Europe on our opposition to 
any action he might take in Ukraine, 
that we are united with our NATO al-
lies, that we are united with our Euro-
pean allies. And, unfortunately, one of 
those major allies is Germany. 
And I don’t think it would be good 
for the unity message that we need to 
give to Putin to, at this point, sanction 
Nord Stream 2 because I think the Ger-
mans are going to come to that conclu-
sion on their own. They have a new ad-
ministration. They have a new admin-
istration that has issued some con-
tracts—what they call contracts in de-
veloping their coalition government— 
that have a very different tone with re-
spect to how they are talking about 
Russia and China, for that matter, and 
so I think it is more prudent. 
I also have real concerns about the 
current legislation on Nord Stream 2. 
But I think it is more prudent for us to 
continue to work with our allies to 
make clear to Putin what is at stake. 
And Nord Stream 2 is at stake if he 
goes into Ukraine. There is no about 
that. And right now, as we know, the 
certification of the pipeline has been 
delayed, and it has been delayed until 
well after the first of the year. We are 
not sure what the timetable is, but it is 
going to be sometime after the spring. 
So I just came to a different conclu-
sion than you did, Senator CRUZ, about 
the best way to deter Putin at this 
point. I think it is to work together. It 
is not to poke a finger at our most 
prominent ally on this issue and sug-
gest that we create those divisions, 
which is what you would like to do. 
And I think, furthermore, that the 
efforts to undermine our appointment 
of Ambassadors and our ability for the 
State Department to conduct foreign 
policy further weakens our ability to 
negotiate with Putin. And it sends a 
message about divisions within Con-
gress that is really not helpful. It is 
not helpful as Putin is watching us; it 
is not helpful as China is watching us. 
So you and I just have fundamentally 
different views of how best to address 
this issue and how we can achieve the 
goal that we both want, which is to end 
Nord Stream 2 and reduce Europe’s de-
pendence on Russia and to prevent 
Putin from invading Ukraine. 
So, Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object. You know, I would 
note that Senator SHAHEEN said it was 
simplistic to say that sanctioning Nord 
Stream 2 would stop a Russian inva-
sion of Ukraine. And in that, Senator 
SHAHEEN may well be right. 
I cannot guarantee that Nord Stream 
2 sanctions would prevent an invasion 
of Ukraine. What we do know is, it has 
in the past—what we do know is that in 
2014, when Putin invaded Ukraine in 
the Crimea, that he stopped short of a 
full invasion because he needed the 
Ukrainian energy infrastructure. 
And we also know that, during the 
more than a year in which the Cruz- 
Shaheen sanctions were in effect and 
Nord Stream 2 was dead, that Putin 
didn’t amass troops in preparation for 
an invasion. So we know that it has 
been effective. 
And we also know, although I cannot 
promise that sanctioning Nord Stream 
2 would prevent an invasion—we know 
the obverse is true, which is that al-
lowing Nord Stream 2 to go online and 
become operational would invite an in-
vasion. 
Senator SHAHEEN noted that the cer-
tification process is expected to be con-
cluded in January or February of next 
year. 
I would note that according to the 
Biden administration’s own documents, 
the Russian invasion is expected, po-
tentially, in January or February of 
next year. I do not believe it is coinci-
dental that the instant Putin can turn 
on the switch of Nord Stream 2 is when 
the tanks are preparing to invade. 
If the Senate Democrats continue 
their partisan blockade of sanctions, 
they are inviting a Russian invasion. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Will my colleague 
let me ask a question? 
Mr. CRUZ. I would happily consent 
to a colloquy. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. I just want to cor-
rect what I said because I think the 
Senator mischaracterized it. 
What I said was, we know that the 
certification has been delayed until 
after the first of the year, and it is not 
likely to happen until after the spring, 
which is well later than January, Feb-
ruary, So I just want to correct for the 
record that. And I think if you look at 
what is being proposed, you will find 
that it is even later than that. 
Mr. CRUZ. Well, I will accept that 
correction. I don’t believe the Senator 
said the spring. I think the Senator 
said after the first of the year, but— 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Then I went on to 
say, after the spring, as well. I just 
want the Senator to listen to what I 
said. 
Mr. CRUZ. I do not think it is coinci-
dental that the timing of Nord Stream 
2 and the timing of an invasion are 
intertwined. 
Now, Senator SHAHEEN
also sug-
gested the way to prevent an invasion 
is to be united with our allies. I actu-
ally agree with that. 
I would point out that this summer, 
when President Biden waived the sanc-
tions on Nord Stream 2, do you know 
what our allies said? Ukraine and Po-
land put out a joint statement. I would 
encourage you to read the joint state-
ment from the Foreign Ministers of 
Ukraine and Poland because they de-
nounced the Biden administration for 
waiving sanctions on Nord Stream 2. 
And do you know what Ukraine told 
us? 
That 
waiving 
those 
sanctions 
makes a military attack on Ukraine 
much more likely. That is what Poland 
told us. 
Senator SHAHEEN
knows that. She 
has spoken with the governments of 
both countries, I am sure. I have spo-
ken with the governments of both 
countries. And they adamantly believe 
that waiving those sanctions is a major 
force increasing the likelihood of a 
Russian invasion. 
You know, one of the things that is 
striking in the debates we have had in 
Nord Stream 2, throughout the course 
of all of this, we have yet to see a sin-
gle Democrat stand up and defend the 
Biden administration’s waiver of sanc-
tions on Nord Stream 2 on the merits. 
They all know it is wrong. 
The only arguable benefit that the 
Biden White House claims is they

S9076 
December 9, 2021 
earned some good will with Angela 
Merkel. Angela Merkel had been the 
leader of Germany. But, as Senator 
SHAHEEN noted, she is no longer the 
leader of Germany. The German people 
voted her party out of office. And the 
new administration is expected to op-
pose Nord Stream 2. 
So we literally have a situation in 
which the Biden White House surren-
dered to Russia, gave a multibillion- 
dollar pipeline to finance the Russian 
military, abandon our Ukrainian allies, 
and did it all in search of good will 
from a leader who is no longer in office. 
Do you want us to be united? The Eu-
ropean Parliament voted to condemn 
Nord Stream 2. The last vote was 
roughly 500 to 50 to condemn Nord 
Stream 2. Do you want to be united? 
How about if we stand with the 500 and 
not the 50? 
If Senate Democrats would not object 
to my motion, we would be standing 
with the whole of Europe, and we 
would be united. 
And a final observation, Senator 
SHAHEEN decried the holds as an effort 
to undermine Ambassadors. I would 
note that I have offered here, as I have 
offered many, many times—as I have 
offered in writing as far back as August 
of this year—to lift the holds if we 
adopt policy that actually stands up to 
Russia. 
Senator SHAHEEN says her changed 
position is not partisan. I understand 
why one would want to say that. But 
her substantive argument is, now, she 
doesn’t want us to disagree with Ger-
many. 
Well, when Senator SHAHEEN and I 
authored Cruz-Shaheen in 2019, when 
we authored the second Cruz-Shaheen 
in 2020, when we passed both of them, 
we were disagreeing with Germany. 
The German Government was very un-
happy with it. But it was the right 
thing for American national security. 
Nothing has changed. 
And by the way, when there was a 
Republican President in the White 
House, I repeatedly took on the Trump 
administration and pressed them on 
this issue. The only thing that has 
changed—one thing has changed: the 
letter behind the name of the person in 
the White House. Now, it is a ‘‘D’’ and 
not an ‘‘R.’’ And all the Democrats who 
gave speeches on Nord Stream 2, sud-
denly, we hear crickets. That needs to 
change. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I just 
want to clarify a couple of things that 
Senator CRUZ said. One is that the 
Nord Stream 2 pipeline was completed, 
despite those sanctions, because what 
Russia did was to employ their own 
ships with Gazprom and complete the 
Nord Stream 2 pipeline despite the 
sanctions that we had threatened. And 
it was, in fact, not until right before he 
left office that President Trump actu-
ally invoked some of those sanctions. 
So, again, I think the response has 
been somewhat simplistic in terms of 
what we really need to do now to ad-
dress what is happening with Russia 
and Ukraine. And I certainly applaud 
our allies: Poland and Ukraine. But I 
think we need to stand united with 
many more of our allies in Europe in 
order to deter Putin that the United 
States, Poland, and Ukraine probably 
are not going to do it on our own, and 
we need all of us to act together. 
Also, you know, maybe if we had our 
Ambassador to the EU, he could have 
reported to the Senate what the vote 
was in the EU about Nord Stream 2, 
but because he is still on hold, we 
haven’t had a chance to hear from him. 
I would also point out that at this 
time in the first year of the Trump ad-
ministration, 44 of his Ambassadors 
had been confirmed, compared to 13 for 
the Biden administration. And, you 
know, it seems like there ought to be a 
number of things we can agree on. And 
by the way, there was going to be a 
vote on Nord Stream 3 before some of 
your colleagues objected to the process 
under the Defense bill. If that hadn’t 
happened, we would have actually had 
a vote on Nord Stream 2 and we could 
see what the view of this body is. But, 
unfortunately, it was because of those 
objections that we didn’t get that vote. 
I think, again, if you look at our 
ability to conduct our foreign policy 
and to be effective against Vladimir 
Putin, one of the most important 
things we can do is to put in place our 
diplomats so that they can help ad-
vance American foreign policy. 
What is happening right now, in addi-
tion to those people you have on hold, 
we have over 50 State Department 
nominees on hold because of your ob-
jections and the objections of some of 
your other colleagues. Again, I don’t 
think that is where most of the Mem-
bers of your caucus are. I think most of 
them, while they may not agree with 
all these Ambassadors, they would 
agree that we should go forward and 
allow our foreign policy to move for-
ward with diplomats. 
I understand your objection to Nord 
Stream 2. As I said, I have objected to 
Nord Stream 2. But I think at this 
point what we need to do is look at 
how we can conduct our foreign policy 
in a way that best puts pressure on 
Vladimir Putin, and I just disagree 
with you that that is going to do it 
right now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, a brief mo-
ment of clarification. Several of the 
facts that I said in my remarks are un-
disputed 
because 
they 
are 
undisputable. 
No. 1, it is a fact that Putin stopped 
construction of Nord Stream 2 the 
day—the exact day—that President 
Trump signed the Cruz-Shaheen sanc-
tions into law—that day—and the pipe-
line was dormant for over a year. 
Now, Senator SHAHEEN said Putin ul-
timately went back to building the 
pipeline even with the sanctions on the 
books. That is true—after Joe Biden 
was sworn into office. Putin began 
building the pipeline on January 24, 
2021, 4 days after Biden was sworn in. 
Not a foot of the pipeline was built be-
tween December of 2019, when the sanc-
tions were signed into law, and Janu-
ary 24. Putin began building the pipe-
line because Biden telegraphed his sur-
render. 
Secondly, 
Senator 
SHAHEEN
sug-
gested that if only we had an ambas-
sador, we might know what the Euro-
pean Parliament did. Thankfully, we 
have these magic little devices that let 
us cross the Atlantic in the twinkle of 
an eye, so we actually know that the 
European Parliament voted roughly 500 
to 50 to condemn Nord Stream 2. So if 
we want to stand united with Europe— 
not just Ukraine and Poland; Europe— 
we want to stand up to Nord Stream 2. 
A final point I will say to Senator 
SHAHEEN perhaps is a word of encour-
agement, which is that I have right 
now pending an offer with the Demo-
cratic leadership to lift a number of 
these holds—a significant number of 
these holds—if the Democratic leader-
ship will agree to a vote on Nord 
Stream 2 sanctions. We are engaged in 
productive negotiations on that issue. 
If the Democrats cease obstruction, we 
can have that vote, and a number of 
these holds can be lifted. But that ulti-
mately is going to be a decision for 
Senate Democrats. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING BRIAN BOURGEOIS 
Mr. CASSIDY. Pretty handsome guy, 
huh? Real handsome guy in his dress 
blues. Today, the citizens of Lake 
Charles in the State of Louisiana and 
our country mourn the loss of this U.S. 
Navy SEAL and commander of SEAL 
Team 8. Commander Bourgeois, Brian 
Bourgeois, died from injuries suffered 
during a training accident Saturday. 
We lost a SEAL, a dedicated patriot, a 
son, husband, father, and hero. 
Commander Bourgeois was born 43 
years ago in Lake Charles, LA. He dedi-
cated his adult life to family and to 
service to our country. He began by en-
rolling in the U.S. Naval Academy, 
from which he graduated in May 2001. 
During 
his 
two-decade-long 
career, 
Commander Bourgeois served honor-
ably, led his men bravely, and made 
our country proud. 
The long list of honors and medals 
Commander Bourgeois earned for his 
service to our country includes a 
Bronze Star marked with a ‘‘V,’’ denot-
ing heroic acts performed during com-
bat; two Defense Meritorious Service 
Medals; a Joint Service Commendation 
Medal; two Marine Corps Commenda-
tion 
Medals; 
two 
Marine 
Corps 
Achievement Medals; a Combat Action 
Ribbon; a National Defense Service 
Medal; an Iraq Campaign Medal; and a 
Global 
War 
on 
Terrorism 
Service 
Medal. He was as decorated as he was 
loved.

December 9, 2021 
Commander Bourgeois—a brother and 
former member of the Midshipmen 
football team—the Navy team will run 
out onto the field with a flag of SEAL 
Team 8. That banner, representing his 
spirit, will fly alongside the American 
flag, the Navy flag, and the Marine 
Corps flag. 
The Navy Football Brotherhood, a 
nonprofit organization aimed at sup-
porting the families of their fallen 
teammates, is leading fundraising ef-
forts to help support the Bourgeois 
family. 
Our country has and always will de-
pend on our most noble answering the 
call to serve. To his wife Megan and 
five children, your father represents 
the best of our Nation. He is a hero who 
dedicated his life to defending our 
country and protecting the lives of 
every American. For that, we will be 
forever grateful and shall never forget 
his service and sacrifice. 
Please join me in taking this mo-
ment in silent prayer for Commander 
Bourgeois, his family, and all who 
loved and knew him.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
CHINA 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the threat that is posed by communist 
China. 
China’s economy has grown sevenfold 
in just the last two decades. China al-
ready has a million members in terms 
of active-duty soldiers. China also has 
the largest navy in the world. That is 
right—it is now larger than ours, and 
the Chinese military is not stopping. 
China plans to build more than 100 new 
ships in the next 8 years, and in those 
same 8 years, China is also building 
about 300 missile silos and plans to 
have 1,000 nuclear missiles. Several 
times this year, China has tested 
hypersonic weapons capable of use 
around the world. At the same time, 
the world has witnessed increasing Chi-
nese aggression. China’s goal is unmis-
takable: It truly wants to become the 
world’s one dominant power. 
Since day 1, the Biden administra-
tion has been caught flatfooted as 
President Joe Biden has been soft on 
China. This is no surprise given the 
fact that Joe Biden has been soft on 
China for 50 years. When he was Vice 
President, he said: 
A rising China is a positive . . . develop-
ment, not only for China but for America 
and the world writ large. 
During his run for President, Can-
didate Joe Biden said China was not a 
threat to the United States. During his 
announcement speech when he was an-
nouncing he was going to be a can-
didate for President, he said: 
They’re not bad folks. They’re not com-
petition for us. 
Joe Biden should tell that to the 
working families in factory towns who 
have been put out of business by com-
munist China. He should tell that to 
the families who lost loved ones to 
fentanyl and other opioids made in 
China. He should tell that to the 
Uighurs and ethnic minorities per-
secuted and used as slave labor by the 
Communist Party. 
I have to tell you, leaders on both 
sides of the aisle here have been 
shocked by those comments by then- 
candidate for President Joe Biden. 
Many Democrats recognize the danger 
posed by communist China. Regret-
tably, our President, Joe Biden, is not 
one of them. 
On issue after issue, the Biden ad-
ministration’s policies are only mak-
ing China stronger, and at the same 
time, that makes America weaker. I 
want to just mention a few. 
President Biden’s first budget pro-
posed to basically supersize the Gov-
ernment of the United States—huge 
budget increases in every government 
Agency you can think of except for 
two. The two were Defense and Home-
land Security. 
His political appointees at the Pen-
tagon seem more focused on climate 
change and ‘‘dissident ideologies’’ and 
vaccine mandates than on security 
threats to our Nation. 
While China’s military is growing, 
ours is going broke and ours is going 
woke. That is the difference fundamen-
tally today. 
Joe Biden has stopped America’s pol-
icy of helping developing countries use 
fossil fuels to eliminate poverty and 
grow their economies. Who are these 
other countries turning to for help 
now? Well, they are turning to com-
munist China. 
Joe Biden seems to be doing every-
thing he can to shut down coal produc-
tion here in America. Wyoming is 
proud to be America’s leading coal pro-
ducer, and we have been for 35 years 
straight. Coal is the most affordable 
and reliable energy source known to 
man. Yet Joe Biden is determined to 
drive down coal production and drive 
energy jobs overseas. 
China is not making this same mis-
take. China is acting in its own self-in-
terest. China is producing and using 
more coal than ever before. China is 
also funding the construction of coal- 
fired powerplants as part of their Belt 
and Road Initiative. 
The Biden administration and the 
Democrats have also put a big Christ-
mas present to China in their reckless 
tax-and-spending spree because the bill 
includes trillions of dollars in new 
taxes on American businesses. As a re-
sult, some of our tax rates are going to 
be higher than those in China. It is 
going to make it cheaper to do business 
overseas, and that is exactly what 
many companies will do. 
According to the nonpartisan Tax 
Foundation, the taxes in this bill that 
the Senate is trying to push on the 
Democrats’ side of the aisle and Repub-
licans are trying to stop—the taxes in 
the bill will eliminate 125,000 American 
jobs. 
Democratic giveaways for electric 
vehicles 
will 
also 
send 
additional 
money directly to China. Electric vehi-
cles use lithium batteries. A critical 
mineral necessary for those batteries 
relies on child labor in cobalt mines in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
and slave labor in China. At the same 
time, Democrats’ spending bill would 
virtually end mining on Federal lands 
here at home. Instead of getting the 
minerals we need at home in Wyoming, 
we are going to get them from China. 
More than a million Muslims in the 
western part of China have been put 
into slave labor camps. In many cases, 
those people are forced to make solar 
panels. 
Last week, Senator RUBIO offered an 
amendment to the Defense bill to ban 
imports from Chinese companies using 
slave labor. This is the same legisla-
tion that this Senate passed unani-
mously in July. 
Yet now Democrats are kowtowing to 
an administration weak on China, and 
are blocking Senator RUBIO’s proposal. 
Why 
have 
the 
House 
Democrats 
failed to move forward on this critical 
issue? 
According to the Washington Post, it 
is because the Biden administration 
asked them to. 
The Washington Post reports: ‘‘While 
the administration supports the legis-
lation in public, they are asking Demo-
crats to essentially water it down in 
private’’—that from the Washington 
Post. 
On issue after issue, Democrat poli-
cies are only making America weaker 
and making China stronger. It is no 
wonder only a quarter of Americans ap-
prove of how President Biden is han-
dling China. 
On Monday, the President announced 
the United States will boycott next 
year’s Olympics in Beijing. This is a 
good first step, but it is not enough. 
Symbolism is not enough. It is time for 
Democrats to wake up from this threat 
from communist China before it is way 
too late. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
INSTAGRAM 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, on 
Tuesday, at 3 in the morning, the peo-
ple at Instagram published a blog post 
describing another laundry list of prod-
uct updates they claim will make their 
platform less toxic for children and 
teens. 
And I am sure they thought that the 
dead of night was the right time to 
make this announcement, and I don’t 
blame them. If I wanted to pass off 
something and just give a little lip 
service and a little deflection and 
make it look like some type of mean-
ingful reform, I might try a 3 a.m. news 
dump also. 
Because what they did was to put up 
changes on how to handle things on 
their site with drug use and self-harm 
and violence and eating disorders and 
low self-esteem and human trafficking 
and bullying. 
What they told us is they know there 
is violence and adverse content on

S9078 
December 9, 2021 
their site. And, yesterday, at the hear-
ing at our Consumer Protection Sub-
committee of the Commerce Com-
mittee, Senator BLUMENTHAL
and I 
made it fairly clear to our friends from 
the Silicon Valley that they cannot es-
cape accountability for what is hap-
pening on their site—not from Con-
gress and not from the American peo-
ple. I am talking about the moms, the 
dads, the teachers, the pediatricians, 
who approach me every single day that 
I am in Tennessee. 
They are worried about their kids, 
and the concern is not the product of 
generational differences. When they 
were growing up, drugs and eating dis-
orders and bullying were problems, 
but—you know what, Mr. President— 
they weren’t inescapable. 
Now these horrible things follow our 
children every minute of every day, all 
courtesy of Big Tech. So, yes, when a 
company like Instagram claims that 
they are going to do more to support 
parents and to keep kids safe, Ten-
nesseans listen, but they don’t take 
their word for it. They test it out. They 
look for evidence of accountability. 
And with all of these updates that 
they posted, they didn’t give us trans-
parency. They didn’t give a timeline 
for when they are going to be imple-
mented. Basically, they said: We know 
this is a problem, and we will get 
around to fixing it at some point in the 
future. 
They are still not making changes. 
I 
do 
want 
to 
thank 
Chairman 
BLUMENTHAL and other members of the 
subcommittee for staying focused on 
this issue. This time around, we had 
Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri on the 
witness stand, and it really was perfect 
timing. 
You know, yesterday’s hearing was 
the fifth time this year that the sub-
committee has met to discuss what 
Congress and Big Tech should do to 
protect our precious children online. It 
was the fourth time I have personally 
spoken to someone from Meta, as they 
now 
call 
themselves, 
which 
is 
Instagram’s parent. And by this point, 
I felt like maybe they would come for-
ward with something concrete for us: 
This is how we are going to get things 
done. 
But, no, nothing changes. 
This week, my staff put themselves 
through yet another deep dive into the 
dark corners of Instagram and con-
firmed that there has been no crack-
down 
on 
dangerous 
content, 
as 
Instagram has previously claimed. 
We searched for posts that glorified 
eating disorders and drug use, and it 
took them about 30 seconds to find 
those posts glorifying drug use and eat-
ing disorders. And they are not nearly 
as good at this as the 14- and 15-year- 
olds who are on this platform are at 
finding this content. 
If they can find this content given 
half a minute and a decent internet 
connection, then why can’t Instagram 
find this? Why do they continue to 
deny that it is there? 
One of the things that shocked me 
the most with Mr. Mosseri’s testimony 
was his refusal to admit that this con-
tent is still pervasive. He was abso-
lutely sure that we were hitting him 
with anecdotal evidence, and he said as 
much. 
But it wasn’t just me finding this 
terrible content on the platform; it was 
everyone on our committee, Democrat 
and Republican. There was agreement. 
We all came to the table with evidence 
of what we had found online. 
I will still stipulate that we all share 
the same goal of protecting our chil-
dren and teens online, but nothing has 
made me question that more than 
watching 
executive 
after 
executive 
from platform after platform deny the 
existence of these problems. 
The time for talking through these 
problems is over. The people who work 
for Big Tech at Instagram, Facebook, 
Snapchat, 
TikTok, 
Google 
are 
all 
aware of this problem. They don’t need 
congressional hearings to tell them 
that there are platforms—their plat-
forms—that are hotbeds for trafficking, 
drug use, bullying, and the glorifi-
cation of eating disorders. 
They don’t need me to come to the 
dais with evidence that their current 
protections don’t work and that more 
of the same won’t magically turn the 
tide. They know it, and we know that 
they know it. And their knowledge, it 
hasn’t changed a single thing about 
their business model. 
Fortunately, we have bipartisan mo-
mentum to put some guardrails back 
on these companies. We are working on 
children’s privacy, data security, and 
Section 230 reforms. We are also work-
ing on a national consumer privacy bill 
and kids’ specific policies to keep mi-
nors safe online. No more half meas-
ures; no more empty promises. 
I have been working in tech policy 
for quite a while now, and I watched 
companies like Instagram grow from 
these tiny, great ideas and startups 
into multibillion-dollar corporations, 
the largest in our country. Their plat-
forms are integrated into our lives, our 
culture, our politics. They are up-
stream from everything. 
Unfortunately, they are also places 
where teens can go to buy drugs, bully 
their classmates, find human traf-
fickers, sex traffickers, and where girls 
waste away. If anyone deserves an ex-
planation from Big Tech, it is the chil-
dren and teens and their parents who 
are suffering because of these compa-
nies. 
I invite my colleagues to join me in 
holding these companies accountable. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Hawaii. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. SCHATZ. I ask unanimous con-
sent that, at 6:15 p.m., all postcloture 
time on the House message to accom-
pany S. 610 be expired; that the motion 
to concur with amendment be with-
drawn; that if cloture is invoked on the 
Koh nomination, the Senate vote im-
mediately—vote immediately—on the 
motion to invoke cloture on the Sung 
nomination; further, that if cloture is 
invoked on either nomination, all 
postcloture time be expired and the 
confirmation vote on the Koh nomina-
tion occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, De-
cember 13, and the confirmation vote 
on the Sung nomination occur at a 
time to be determined by the majority 
leader in consultation with the Repub-
lican leader; further, that the cloture 
motions on the Elliott nomination and 
on the House message to accompany S. 
1605 ripen on Tuesday, December 14. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHATZ. For the information of 
Senators, there will be three rollcall 
votes beginning at 6:15. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I want 
to rise today to support the nomina-
tions of Victoria Wassmer to be Chief 
Financial Officer of the Department of 
Transportation, and Mohsin Syed to be 
the Department’s Assistant Secretary 
for Governmental Affairs. 
Right now, we are facing supply 
chain issues. The reason for this in-
cludes 
unprecedented 
demand 
for 
goods, market disruptions caused by 
the pandemic, and greater demand. 
But the biggest issue is the lack of 
investment in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture over the past half century. Simply 
put, we need better infrastructure to 
move things in, out, and across the 
country. And that is why it is so im-
portant that we pass the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill. 
The bill provides a historic $567 bil-
lion to the Department of Transpor-
tation, including $37 billion for freight 
investments. It creates new programs 
to reduce bottlenecks and ease supply 
chain congestion. 
The $1.5 billion for my home State of 
Hawaii will give a massive boost to our 
local economy. But DOT needs staff to 
make this investment work. 
Ms. Wassmer is well qualified to 
serve as CFO, with private- and public- 
sector experience, including as CFO of 
the FAA. 
The same goes for Mr. Syed as Assist-
ant Secretary for Governmental Af-
fairs. He spent 6 years on Capitol Hill, 
including in my office, and worked in 
the DOT general counsel’s office. That 
is why he passed out of the Commerce 
Committee with overwhelming bipar-
tisan support, and that is why it is so 
maddening that Republicans are now 
refusing to move these nominations 
forward. 
These are not controversial individ-
uals. This is basically a blanket hold to 
stop the government from functioning, 
to stop the infrastructure bill from 
being implemented. And nobody wins 
here. We don’t win passing a huge bill 
and then kneecapping it. And the 
American people who sent us here to 
serve certainly don’t win. 
So let us do our job and move these 
nominees forward. And so, therefore, I

standing rule XXII, the Senate proceed

lowing nominations: Executive cal-
endar Nos. 468 and 469; that the nomi-
nations be confirmed; the motions to

lative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object. 
I am sure my colleague is aware that, 
last month, I sent a letter to the Com-
merce Committee—a committee on 
which we both serve—informing the 
chair that I would be holding all De-
partment of Transportation and De-
partment of Commerce nominees until 
the Senate-confirmed leadership from 
these Agencies testify about the supply 
chain crisis. 
Right now, there are nearly 100 ships 
waiting to dock in California ports to 
unload their goods, but they are unable 
to do so because of President Biden’s 
supply chain crisis. Christmas is just a 
couple weeks away, and families and 
businesses are facing empty shelves, 
shortages on goods, and higher prices. 
And, so far, Secretary Raimondo and 
Secretary Buttigieg have been too busy 
playing TV commentator to actually 
go to California and solve the problem. 
It is long past time for the Biden ad-
ministration to tell us what they are 
actually doing to solve this crisis and 
help American families. 
I appreciate my colleague’s partner-
ship with me on the issues under the 
purview of the Commerce Committee. 
In fact, I am looking forward to next 
week, when the bill we are putting to-
gether will be considered during a 
Commerce markup hearing. 
Given that we will be in session next 
week, I would urge my colleagues to 
join me in urging leadership from the 
Commerce and Transportation Depart-
ments that come before the committee 
and testify on what those Agencies are 
doing to combat and mitigate the sup-
ply chain crisis that is hurting so 
many families and businesses in Flor-
ida and across the country. 
This isn’t an unreasonable request. 
The Senate has oversight authority, 
and we can’t allow Agency leadership 
to just ignore their responsibility to 
report to us on these issues impacting 
our constituents. 
But if that is too much to ask, I am 
inviting Secretary Raimondo and Sec-
retary Buttigieg to even just have an 
open, public meeting with me and my 
colleagues. But until we hear from Sen-
ate-confirmed officials responsible for 
this crisis in the Commerce committee, 
I will be objecting to all Commerce and 
Transportation 
nominees 
going 
through an expedited process here in 
the Senate. 
This isn’t personal. It is about ac-
countability 
for 
Florida 
families. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard.

TRIBUTE TO JUDGE PATRICK CARROLL 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise—I 
want to thank Senator SCHATZ
for 
making that motion and his fight for 
these nominees to get the government 
running, when the chairman of the 
Senate 
Republican 
Campaign 
Com-
mittee and others continue to block 
one nominee after another nominee 
after another nominee. 
I rise to honor an Ohio public servant 
who is retiring this month after 32 
years of service on the bench in North-
east Ohio. 
Judge Patrick Carroll, whom I knew 
30 years ago before he was on the 
bench, as a—just a good citizen of Cuy-
ahoga County, has dedicated his life to 
serving Ohioans, including serving as 
Lakewood Municipal Court Judge for 
some three decades. 
He grew up in Northeast Ohio. Judge 
Carroll spent his life in the commu-
nity, from Cleveland State to the 
Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, to 
the county prosecutor’s office, to the 
local bench. 
He not only served the public in the 
courtroom, he has been a lifelong 
teacher—by 
many 
different 
defini-
tions—mentoring young attorneys and 
judges at his law school and then on 
the faculty of the Ohio Judicial Col-
lege. 
Twice in the last 3 years, Judge Car-
roll received the President’s Award for 
Judicial Excellence from the Associa-
tion of Municipal and County Court 
Judges of Ohio. 
I had the privilege of joining him ear-
lier this fall, along with Ohio Supreme 
Court Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, 
for a bipartisan event of highlighting 
the innovative work that they were 
both doing. 
Judge Carroll—the innovative work 
that they have done preventing evic-
tions during the pandemic helped get 
the word out to more Ohio judges 
about what they can do to connect 
Ohio with the emergency rental assist-
ance that we provided back months ago 
from the Congress. 
In the American Rescue Plan, we pro-
vided grants to State and local govern-
ments for emergency rental and utility 
assistance to families across the coun-
try. The last thing we wanted was a 
wave of evictions during the health cri-
sis. We know people move in with fam-
ily members, the COVID spreads even 
faster. We know that happened too 
often. 
This eviction prevention effort was a 
lifeline for so many families that that 
might have happened to. 
We know what it does to families 
even during normal times. Think about 
the upheaval that that causes, espe-
cially for children. Their health suf-
fers. They may get pulled out of their 
school to go to a different school. They 
may have to give up their pet because 
the pet costs too much money. You 
can’t bring them to a new apartment. 
They don’t feel stable. It is much hard-
er for their parents to get back to work 
using public transportation, if they are 
even served, and to earn a living. 
As all of us know, when people are 
evicted, they end up in crowded shel-
ters or moving in with family. It 
makes 
them 
more 
vulnerable 
to 
coronavirus. It makes it more likely to 
spread, especially among people who 
are not vaccinated. 
We know that 90 percent of the hos-
pitalizations—whether it is Columbus, 
GA, or Columbus, OH—90 percent of pa-
tients in hospitals with COVID are 
unvaccinated. 
Finding another place to rent after 
an eviction is much, much harder. 
After we passed the American Rescue 
Plan, not enough people knew help was 
available to them. That is where Judge 
Carroll came in. That is where Chief 
Justice O’Connor came in. The work 
they have done to divert eviction pro-
ceedings and connect people with help 
is literally lifesaving for many. 
He taught courses to the State judi-
ciary on eviction law. He worked with 
tenants and landlords to divert evic-
tion proceedings. Judges can work to 
connect both renters and landlords 
with the help available to them. 
Ohio leads the way because of Judge 
Carroll and because of Chief Justice 
O’Connor in preventing evictions and 
connecting people with their potential 
emergency rental assistance. These ac-
tions by the judges encourage them 
to—tenants to explore all rental assist-
ance options before the judge proceeds 
with an eviction case. 
Since the start of the pandemic, 
more than 1,000 households in Lake-
wood, OH, a suburb west of Cleveland, 
have been connected with some form of 
rental help—more than 1,000 house-
holds. That is because of the work that 
Judge Carroll did and the work that 
Justice O’Connor has done around the 
State. It is the kind of success we want 
to see replicated in Ohio and across the 
country. 
In September, Judge Carroll told us 
that judges need to ‘‘recognize eviction 
cases are more than civil cases for dis-
position. An eviction order impacts a 
person’s life, home and property, and in 
many cases, the lives of children who 
are uprooted from school when forced 
to move.’’ 
He is a judge that—as President Lin-
coln used to tell his staff, I have got to 
leave the White House and go out and 
get my public opinion bath. That is 
what Judge Carroll as a judge does. It 
is not necessarily something most 
judges do, but when he does that, he 
finds out what he can do as a judge to 
prevent families from being evicted. 
We need more judges in Ohio and 
around the country to follow his lead 
in a final push to get rental assistance 
to Americans in need.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9080 
December 9, 2021 
The Biden administration has worked 
throughout the year with us on evic-
tion—on help for evictions, on emer-
gency rental assistance, cutting red-
tape, encouraging State and local gov-
ernments to move faster to get this 
help to families and landlords. That 
work has delivered impressive results. 
More than 520,000 renters received 
emergency rental assistance in October 
alone. 
It means those families were able to 
keep their homes, keep their lights on 
in October, work to get back on their 
feet, and recover from the pandemic. 
In total, more than 21⁄2 million pay-
ments have gone out to tenants and 
landlords. Now, with the end of the 
year approaching, we need that final 
push to get funding to the renters and 
the landlords who need it. 
As Judge Carroll prepares for a well- 
earned retirement, it is my hope that 
this will be an important part of his 
legacy—of 
the 
work 
Chief 
Justice 
O’Connor does and the work that they 
do in Ohio and we can do around the 
country—as an example to public serv-
ants in Ohio and all over the United 
States, showing how we can keep a roof 
over families’ heads, allow landlords to 
pay their bills, and emerge stronger 
from this pandemic. 
I urge my colleagues—ask them to 
join me in honoring Judge Patrick Car-
roll and a lifetime of service to the 
people of my great State. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF JENNIFER SUNG 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate will soon vote on President Biden’s 
nomination of my neighbor and fellow 
Oregonian, Jennifer Sung, to serve on 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. 
I guess I ought to save everybody 
some suspense. I am proud to support 
her nomination, and I just want to 
take a few minutes to talk about why 
she deserves the support of all Sen-
ators. 
First, with respect to her qualifica-
tions, Ms. Sung is a graduate of Oberlin 
College and Yale Law School. As a stu-
dent, she volunteered to represent low- 
income patients at a local hospital. As 
a legal fellow at the Brennan Center 
for Justice, she fought on behalf of 
workers who toiled in poor conditions 
for little pay. In private practice, she 
defended the rights of all people in our 
country to work in safe and fair condi-
tions, to get the healthcare they need, 
and to freely exercise their constitu-
tional rights. 
Currently, Ms. Sung serves as a mem-
ber of Oregon’s Employment Relations 
Board. That is the board that adju-
dicates disputes over labor practices 
and employment law. She has decided 
more than 200 cases in that role. She 
has proven her impartiality, which I 
think we all understand is fundamental 
to what we need in a justice. And she 
has certainly shown her diligence and 
her commitment to justice. Her quali-
fications, in my view, simply cannot be 
questioned. 
Second, I have had the chance to get 
to know Ms. Sung personally since her 
nomination, and what struck me is we 
both have a family story that is only 
possible here in our great country. 
Members of her family fled political 
persecution and violence in China in 
the 1940s—the Wydens fled the terror or 
Nazis just a few years earlier—and they 
barely spoke any English when they ar-
rived here in their new home. 
Our country provided safety and op-
portunity for my family and for Ms. 
Sung’s family. And I have always found 
that so many who have that family 
story take a special interest in pro-
tecting the rights and the freedoms 
Americans enjoy. That has been a hall-
mark of Ms. Sung’s legal career, and it 
is something, in my view, that all Sen-
ators ought to support. 
So I am proud to describe my South-
east Portland neighbor, Jennifer Sung, 
as a talented, committed individual 
who will be a great asset on the bench. 
She is going to be a superb judge. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
Jennifer Sung when we vote soon on 
President Biden’s nomination, Orego-
nian Jennifer Sung, to serve on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Utah. 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the Senate, 
today, will pass a bill that, quite lit-
erally, gives a blank check to Presi-
dent Biden and the Democrats. They 
will use it to pass the ‘‘destroy Amer-
ica bill,’’ which they call Build Back 
Better. 
There is literally a blank check in 
the bill. It is literally a blank check. 
The Senators who gave that blank 
check don’t want you to know that 
they did it. They used procedural jiu-
jitsu to hide their votes. Republicans 
are hiding behind Democrats, and 
Democrats are hiding behind Repub-
licans, but the American people see 
through it. 
They closed the doors, held their 
noses, and created a new way to pass 
bad bills and claimed that it was just 
this one time. 
Mark my words: This bill will be one 
more tool repeatedly used to abuse the 
American people. 
This debt ceiling increase is a blank 
check for the Democrats’ reckless tax- 
and-spending bill. It should have never 
happened. 
f 
NOMINATION OF LUCY H. KOH 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in support of the nomination 
of Lucy H. Koh to serve as a judge on 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. 
Judge Koh is a highly respected 
member of the Federal judiciary and 
has served California well throughout 
her career. She would be a welcome ad-
dition to the Ninth Circuit bench. 
I have long supported Judge Koh and 
am pleased that the Senate will soon 
be considering her nomination. I rec-
ommended Judge Koh for a seat on the 
Ninth Circuit back in 2016 and was 
pleased that President Obama nomi-
nated her at that time. And I was dis-
appointed that she did not receive a 
vote on the Senate floor, even though 
she received strong bipartisan support 
in the Judiciary Committee, which fa-
vorably reported her nomination. 
I am pleased that Judge Koh was 
among the first circuit court nominees 
announced by President Biden earlier 
this year. Her credentials are undeni-
ably impressive. She received her un-
dergraduate degree from Harvard Col-
lege in 1990, and her law degree from 
Harvard Law School in 1993. 
Judge Koh spent several years early 
in her career in public service, first as 
a legal fellow on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee’s 
Immigration 
Sub-
committee and then with the Depart-
ment of Justice. Among her achieve-
ments while at the Justice Depart-
ment, Judge Koh received an award 
from the FBI for ‘‘Demonstrated Excel-
lence in Prosecuting a Major Fraud 
Case.’’ 
She then brought her skills to the 
private sector, spending nearly a dec-
ade in private practice in Palo Alto, 
CA, where she became a distinguished 
intellectual property lawyer working 
on patent, trade secret, and commer-
cial civil litigation. In 2008, she was ap-
pointed by California’s then-Governor 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, 
to serve as a judge on the California 
Superior Court for Santa Clara County. 
In 2010, President Obama nominated 
her to serve as a Federal district judge 
on the U.S. District Court for the 
Northern District of California. The 
Senate voted unanimously, 90 to 0, to 
confirm her to that position. She has 
served with distinction as a Federal 
district judge for more than a decade. 
Judge Koh has excelled throughout 
her career as a Federal prosecutor, in 
private practice, and as both a state 
and Federal judge. I have no doubt that 
she will continue to excel if she is con-
firmed to the Ninth Circuit. 
Judge Koh has received bipartisan 
support each time her nomination has 
come before the Senate, including a bi-
partisan vote earlier this year in the 
Judiciary Committee. I urge all of my 
colleagues to support her nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that all remaining 
time be yielded back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered.

The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Jennifer Sung, 
of Oregon, to be United States Circuit 
Judge for the Ninth Circuit. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I just 
would like to speak about the vote we 
had—the first vote. 
I am really pleased that this Cham-
ber just passed legislation setting up a 
fast-track process with debt ceiling 
legislation—no brinksmanship, no de-
fault on the debt, no risk of another re-
cession. Responsible governing won the 
day. This is now headed to the Presi-
dent’s desk. 
I want to be clear. This is about pay-
ing debt accumulated by both parties. 
So I am pleased we were able to facili-
tate a process with the support of 
Members from both parties that avoids 
a needless and catastrophic default and 
cuts to Medicare. 
This was a bipartisan process, and I 
hope there can be more. And I want to 
thank Leader MCCONNELL for working 
with us in good faith to get to this 
point. 
We 
started 
this 
month 
with 
a 
daunting to-do list, but we have made 
significant progress and are on track to 
get the work done. To repeat, we did 
this with no brinksmanship, no default 
on debt, no risk of another recession. It 
was responsible governing that won the 
day, and now the bill is headed to the 
President’s desk. 
I expect—after this legislation is 
signed, I expect new legislation will be 
introduced to increase the debt limit, 
and we intend to pass it by December 
15. The American people can breathe 
easy and rest assured there will not be 
a default. 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
consider the following nominations: 
Calendar No. 359 and 361; that the Sen-
ate vote on the nominations en bloc 
without intervening action or debate; 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate; 
that any statements related to the 
nominations be printed in the RECORD; 
that the President be immediately no-
tified of the Senate’s action and the 
Senate resume legislation session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the nominations 
en bloc. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the nominations of Stephen 
A. Owens, of Arizona, to be a Member 
of the Chemical Safety and Hazard In-

STATES 
POLICY TOWARD SOUTH SUDAN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 160, S. Res. 380. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 380) reiterating 
United States support for the people of the 
Republic of South Sudan in their quest for 
lasting peace, stability, and democracy after 
10 years of independence and calling for a re-
view of United States policy toward South 
Sudan. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic, and with an amend-
ment to strike the preamble and insert 
the part printed in italic, as follows: 
ø$6,000,000,000 in emergency humanitarian 
assistance since the start of the civil war in 
December 2013; 
øWhereas, on July 9, 2021, the United Na-
tions Mission in South Sudan marked 10 
years in existence at a total cost of more 
than $10,300,000,000, and total United States 
contributions 
are 
estimated 
to 
exceed 
$3,300,000,000 through 2021; 
øWhereas the leaders of South Sudan have 
consistently failed to uphold their respon-
sibilities to create the conditions for peace 
and prosperity, have prioritized self-preser-
vation and corruption over the needs of the 
people they represent, have acted in bad 
faith in the implementation of cease-fire and 
peace agreements, and have betrayed the 
cause of freedom, resulting in the loss of mil-
lions of innocent lives; 
øWhereas South Sudan has not held an 
election since its independence and the cur-
rent leaders of South Sudan were appointed 
or installed through transitional arrange-
ments based on peace agreements; 
øWhereas South Sudan merits consistent 
high-level attention given the central role 
the United States played in diplomatic ef-
forts leading to the independence of South 
Sudan and the enormous investments in hu-
manitarian and other assistance the United 
States has provided to South Sudan; and 
øWhereas, on July 9, 2021, South Sudan 
celebrated the 10th anniversary of its inde-
pendence: Now, therefore, be it¿ 
Whereas the Republic of South Sudan became 
the newest country in the world on July 9, 2011, 
following the Referendum on the Self-Deter-
mination of Southern Sudan, in which 99 per-
cent of Southern Sudanese voters voted in favor 
of secession from Sudan; 
Whereas the 21-year civil war in Sudan, the 
longest-running conflict in Africa, caused ap-
proximately 2,000,000 deaths and mass popu-
lation displacement of approximately 550,000 ref-
ugees and 4,000,000 internally displaced persons; 
Whereas the United States played a signifi-
cant role in supporting the resolution of Su-
dan’s civil war, facilitating peace negotiations, 
serving as a guarantor to the Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement between the Government of the 
Republic of the Sudan and the Sudan People’s 
Liberation Movement/Sudan People’s Liberation 
Army signed in January 2005, and providing 
substantial resources for the implementation of 
that agreement alongside other international 
partners; 
Whereas, on December 15, 2013, just 28 months 
following independence, the political power 
struggle between President Salva Kiir and Vice 
President Riek Machar, both of the Sudan Peo-
ple’s Liberation Movement (SPLM), erupted into 
open conflict between ethnically allied Dinka 
and Nuer factions of the security services and 
quickly escalated into civil war; 
Whereas, on August 17, 2015, after months of 
mediation by the Intergovernmental Authority 
on Development, the Agreement on the Resolu-
tion of the Conflict in the Republic of South 
Sudan was signed by President Kiir, Riek 
Machar for SPLM-In Opposition (SPLM-IO), 
and Pagan Amum for SPLM-Former Detainees; 
Whereas the parties to the Agreement on the 
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of 
South Sudan demonstrated a lack of political 
will for sustainable peace, delaying implementa-
tion of the agreement, and in July 2016, new 
clashes in Juba quickly spread, returning the 
country to civil war; 
Whereas the Revitalized Agreement on the 
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of 
South Sudan, signed on September 12, 2018, re-
asserted the Parties’ commitment to a permanent 
ceasefire, humanitarian access, and respect for 
human rights, and called for the establishment 
of a Revitalized Transitional Government of Na-
tional Unity to lead South Sudan to democratic 
elections after 44 months; 
Whereas Kiir’s presidential term has been ex-
tended 3 times since South Sudan’s independ-
ence, twice through amendments to the Transi-
tional Constitution of South Sudan and most re-
cently through an extension of the Transitional 
Period under the Revitalized Agreement on the

Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of 
South Sudan to 2023; 
Whereas, despite years of fighting, the wide-
spread suffering of South Sudanese civilians, 
punitive actions by the international commu-
nity, and 2 peace agreements, the leaders of 
South Sudan have failed to build sustainable 
peace, and critical provisions of the Revitalized 
Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in 
the 
Republic 
of 
South 
Sudan 
remain 
unimplemented; 
Whereas the conflict in South Sudan resulted 
in the deaths of at least 383,000 people from De-
cember 2013 to April 2018, according to a report 
by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine, and caused one of the worst displace-
ment crises in the world with 1,600,000 inter-
nally displaced persons and 2,200,000 refugees 
and asylum seekers in the region as of May 
2021, according to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees; 
Whereas South Sudan ranks 185th of 189

the 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index, is peren-
nially one of the most dangerous countries in 
which aid workers operate, received the lowest 
ranking in the Department of State’s Traf-
ficking in Persons Report every year from 2015 
to 2021, and has been on the Child Soldiers Pre-
vention Act list for 10 years in a row; 
Whereas the United Nations declared a ‘‘man- 
made’’ famine in parts of South Sudan in Feb-
ruary 2017, and the United Nations Office for 
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs stat-
ed in March 2021 that ‘‘South Sudan is facing 
its highest levels of food insecurity and mal-
nutrition since independence ten years ago’’; 
Whereas the African Union and Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights found that parties to the conflict had 
committed acts that constituted war crimes, 
crimes against humanity, and other violations 
of international humanitarian law; 
Whereas, in February 2021, the United Na-
tions Commission on Human Rights in South 
Sudan ‘‘found that ten years after independ-
ence, staggering levels of violence continue and 
threaten to spiral out of control across several 
regions in the country’’; 
Whereas, in September 2021, the United Na-
tions Deputy High Commissioner for Human 
Rights and the Chairperson of the United Na-
tions Commission on Human Rights in South 
Sudan both reported that there were significant 
levels of localized violence and a marked dete-
rioration of human rights conditions in South 
Sudan; 
Whereas the situation in South Sudan persists 
while its neighbors face increasingly urgent do-
mestic and regional issues, including a fragile 
political transition in Sudan, conflict in Ethi-
opia, and deeply flawed electoral processes and 
political unrest in Uganda and Somalia; 
Whereas the United States has been the larg-
est donor to South Sudan, providing more than 
$1,800,000,000 in development assistance since 
independence and more than $6,000,000,000 in 
emergency humanitarian assistance since the 
start of the civil war in December 2013;

more 
than 
$10,300,000,000, and total United States con-
tributions are estimated to exceed $3,300,000,000 
through 2021; 
Whereas the leaders of South Sudan have 
consistently failed to uphold their responsibil-
ities to create the conditions for peace and pros-
perity, have prioritized self-preservation and 
corruption over the needs of the people they rep-
resent, have acted in bad faith in the implemen-
tation of cease-fire and peace agreements, and 
have betrayed the cause of freedom, resulting in 
the loss of millions of innocent lives; 
Whereas South Sudan has not held an elec-
tion since its independence and the current 
leaders of South Sudan were appointed or in-
stalled through transitional arrangements based 
on peace agreements; 
Whereas South Sudan merits consistent high- 
level attention given the central role the United 
States played in diplomatic efforts leading to the 
independence of South Sudan and the enormous 
investments in humanitarian and other assist-
ance the United States has provided to South 
Sudan; and 
Whereas, on July 9, 2021, South Sudan cele-
brated the 10th anniversary of its independence: 
Now, therefore, be it

S. 3294 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
(a) SANDRA DAY O’CONNOR.—Congress finds 
the following: 
(1) Sandra Day O’Connor was born in 1930 
in El Paso, Texas, and spent her childhood 
on her family’s isolated Arizona cattle 
ranch. She lived with her grandmother in El 
Paso during the school year, away from her 
home and parents. 
(2) O’Connor matriculated to Stanford Uni-
versity at the age of 16, and combined her 
undergraduate and law school curricula, 
graduating with a bachelor’s degree in eco-
nomics and a law degree in just 6 years. She 
was third in her law school class, behind Wil-
liam Rehnquist, her future colleague on the 
Supreme Court of the United States (in this 
section referred to as the ‘‘Supreme Court’’). 
(3) Despite her qualifications, O’Connor 
could not find work as an attorney because 
of bias against women in the law. She ended 
up negotiating for an unpaid position in the 
San Mateo County District Attorney’s office 
at a shared desk, while her husband, John, 
finished at Stanford Law School 1 year later. 
(4) O’Connor traveled to Frankfurt, Ger-
many, in 1954 with her husband John, who 
had joined the United States Army Judge 
Advocate General’s Corps, where she was 
able to find work as a civilian attorney with 
the United States Army Quartermaster 
Corps. In 1957, O’Connor returned to Arizona 
and still could not find work with a tradi-
tional law firm due to her gender, so she 
‘‘hung out a shingle’’ as a sole practitioner. 
(5) In 1965, O’Connor was hired as an Assist-
ant Attorney General for the State of Ari-
zona. 
(6) Active in Republican Party politics and 
well-received for her work at the Arizona 
State Capitol, O’Connor was appointed to an 
Arizona State Senate seat in 1969 when the 
incumbent, also a woman, was appointed to 
a Federal position and vacated the office. 
(7) In 1970, O’Connor was elected to the Ari-
zona State Senate and served 2 consecutive 
terms. In 1972, she was selected as Majority 
Leader of the Arizona State Senate, the first 
time a woman held such a position in any 
State. 
(8) In 1974, O’Connor ran for office as a trial 
court judge. She won and was later ap-
pointed to the Arizona Court of Appeals in 
1979. 
(9) On August 19, 1981, President Ronald 
Reagan nominated O’Connor to be an Asso-
ciate Justice of the Supreme Court, to fill 
the seat vacated by Associate Justice Potter 
Stewart. On September 21, 1981, the Senate 
confirmed O’Connor’s nomination by a unan-
imous vote, making her the first woman to 
serve on the Supreme Court. 
(10) O’Connor established herself as a prag-
matic, independent voice on the Supreme 
Court, casting decisive votes during a time 
when the Court was being asked to resolve 
politically charged issues. 
(11) In the 1982 case of Mississippi Univer-
sity for Women v. Hogan, O’Connor wrote the 
majority opinion holding that the State 
could not prevent men from enrolling in an 
all-women’s nursing school, writing that 
laws discriminating on the basis of sex would 
be allowed only if there was an ‘‘exceedingly 
persuasive justification’’ for them. 
(12) O’Connor sought, when possible, to 
find the middle ground between her often-di-
vided colleagues, frequently joining the ma-
jority decision but presenting her views in 
concurring opinions that eschewed broad

constitutional doctrine in favor of resolving 
the cases before the Court. 
(13) O’Connor put a very public face on the 
role of the Supreme Court, domestically and 
around the world. She became the Court’s 
most prolific public speaker, traveling to all 
50 States and to countless law schools, li-
braries, and public events to describe how 
the Court works and its role in our constitu-
tional form of government. She traveled 
worldwide as an ambassador for the Rule of 
Law and the independence of judiciaries ev-
erywhere. 
(14) After 24 years on the Supreme Court, 
O’Connor announced her retirement to care 
for her ailing husband, who had Alzheimer’s 
disease. President George W. Bush nomi-
nated John Roberts, Jr., for the vacancy, but 
before Roberts was confirmed, Chief Justice 
Rehnquist passed away, creating a second 
vacancy. President Bush personally appealed 
to O’Connor to remain on the Court so he 
could nominate Roberts for the Chief Justice 
vacancy and have more time to make a sec-
ond nomination to the Court. In yet another 
act of public service, O’Connor agreed to 
serve until Samuel Alito was confirmed to 
fill her seat on January 31, 2006. 
(15) O’Connor began her retirement with 2 
goals. One was to convince more States to 
adopt merit selection of judges for filling va-
cancies in State courts. The second was to 
educate the public on the importance of an 
independent judiciary. Her judicial independ-
ence work led to her awareness of a national 
civics education deficit. 
(16) In 2009, O’Connor created iCivics.org to 
educate young Americans about civics and 
what it means to be a citizen. That endeavor 
grew to become the largest civics education 
platform in the country, with over 7,000,000 
students annually enrolling in the programs. 
Its popularity was due to a captivating on-
line, interactive gaming approach. The pro-
gram was free to all and had no advertising. 
iCivics played a crucial role in Educating for 
American Democracy, a federally funded ini-
tiative to improve civics and history edu-
cation, which released its reports in March 
2021. 
(b) RUTH BADER GINSBURG.—Congress finds 
the following: 
(1) Ruth Bader Ginsburg was born in 1933 in 
Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in a low- 
income, working-class neighborhood. 
(2) Ginsburg graduated from Cornell Uni-
versity in 1954, finishing first in her class. 
Following her graduation, Ginsburg enrolled 
at Harvard Law School in 1956, entering into 
a class of 552 men and only 8 other women. 
(3) As a law student, Ginsburg became the 
first female member of the Harvard Law Re-
view, a prestigious legal journal. She also 
cared for her husband, Martin Ginsburg, who 
had been diagnosed with cancer, and their 
young daughter. Ginsburg finished her legal 
education at Columbia Law School, where 
she graduated first in her class in 1959. 
(4) Ginsburg taught at Rutgers University 
Law School from 1963 to 1972 and at Colum-
bia Law School from 1972 to 1980, where she 
became the school’s first female tenured pro-
fessor. 
(5) During the 1970s, Ginsburg served as the 
director of the Women’s Rights Project of 
the American Civil Liberties Union. In this 
position, she led the fight against gender dis-
crimination and successfully argued 6 land-
mark cases before the Supreme Court. 
(6) Ginsburg won 5 cases on gender dis-
crimination before the Supreme Court, in-
cluding the case Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 
which involved a portion of the Social Secu-
rity Act that favored women over men, be-
cause the Act granted certain benefits to 
widows, but not widowers. 
(7) In 1980, President Jimmy Carter nomi-
nated Ginsburg to a seat on the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit. 
(8) On June 22, 1993, President Bill Clinton 
nominated Ginsburg to be an Associate Jus-
tice of the Supreme Court, to fill the seat va-
cated by Associate Justice Byron White. On 
August 3, 1993, the Senate confirmed Gins-
burg’s nomination to the Supreme Court by 
a 96 to 3 vote. 
(9) Ginsburg became the second female jus-
tice to serve on the Supreme Court, as well 
as the first Jewish female justice to serve on 
the Supreme Court. 
(10) As a justice, Ginsburg presented a 
strong voice in favor of gender equality, vot-
ing rights, the rights of workers, and the sep-
aration of church and state. 
(11) In 1996, Ginsburg wrote the Supreme 
Court’s landmark decision in United States 
v. Virginia, which held that the State-sup-
ported Virginia Military Institute could not 
refuse to admit women. 
(12) 
Ginsburg 
famously 
dissented 
in 
Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 
where the plaintiff, a female worker being 
paid significantly less than males with her 
same qualifications, sued under title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et 
seq.), but was denied relief under a statute of 
limitation issue. Ginsburg broke with tradi-
tion and wrote a high colloquial version of 
her dissent to read from the bench. In her 
dissent, she also called for Congress to undo 
this interpretation of the law. 
(13) 
Ginsburg’s 
impactful 
dissent 
in 
Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. led 
to the successful passage of the Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (Public Law 
111–2; 123 Stat. 5), which was the first piece of 
legislation 
signed 
by 
President 
Barack 
Obama. 
(14) Until the 2018 term, Ginsburg had not 
missed a day of oral arguments, not even 
when she was undergoing chemotherapy for 
pancreatic cancer, after surgery for colon 
cancer, or the day after her husband passed 
away in 2010. 
(15) Ginsburg passed away on September 18, 
2020.

mated total cost was $21.1 billion. Major De-
fense Equipment (MDE) constituted $11.5 bil-
lion of this total. 
On January 5, 2018, Congress was notified 
by Congressional certification transmittal 
number 0C–17 for the replacement of the pre-
viously notified two hundred (200) AGM–65H/ 
K (Maverick) missiles (MDE), with two hun-
dred (200) AGM–65G (Maverick) missiles 
(MDE); the inclusion of eighty (80) AAR–57A 
Common Missile Warning Systems (MDE), 
which were included in the total value of the 
DEWS systems previously notified, but not 
enumerated as MDE in the original notifica-
tion; the replacement of five hundred (500) 
BLU–111B bombs, five hundred (500) BLU– 
117B bombs, and six (6) MK–82 Inert bombs 
(all MDE), with five hundred (500) BLU–111B 
or MK–82 (500lbs) bombs, five hundred (500) 
BLU–117B or MK–84 (2,000 lbs) bombs, and six 
(6) MK–82 Inert bombs (all MDE); and the in-
clusion of the following sub-components of 
JDAM and Laser JDAM guidance kits. The 
MDE sub-components were included in the 
total value previously notified, but not enu-
merated in the original notification: 
a. Two hundred fifty (250) GBU–38 JDAMs 
with KMU–572 Air Foil Groups (AFG) (MDE); 
b. Two hundred fifty (250) GBU–31 JDAMs 
with KMU–557 AFG (MDE); 
c. Two hundred fifty (250) GBU–54 Laser 
JDAMs with KMU–572 AFG (MDE) and DSU– 
38 Laser Seeker; and 
d. Two hundred fifty (250) GBU–56 Laser 
JDAMs with KMU–557 AFG (MDE) and DSU– 
40 Laser Seeker. 
The replacement or upgrading of the equip-
ment to MDE did not result in a change to 
the estimated cost of MDE of $11.5 billion. 
The total estimated case value remained 
$21.1 billion. 
On November 28, 2018, Congress was noti-
fied by Congressional certification trans-
mittal number 0L–18 reported the inclusion 
of additional training assets as MDE to sup-
port the previously notified AGM–65 (Mav-
erick) missiles: five (5) TGM–65 Maverick- 
Missile Aircrew Trainer; one (1) TGM–65 
Maverick-Missile Load Trainer; and one (1) 
TGM–65 
Maverick-Missile 
Maintenance 
Trainer. The estimated value of the addi-
tional MDE items was $3.5 million but its ad-
dition did not result in a net increase in the 
MDE value notified. The total estimated 
case value remained $21.1 billion. 
This transmittal reports the inclusion of 
up to Five Hundred (500) GBU–39/B Small Di-
ameter Bombs Increment I (SDB I) (MDE); 
One (1) GBU–39 A/B Focused Lethality Muni-
tion (FLM) Practice Bomb (MDE); One (1) 
GBU–39 B/B Laser SDB Practice Bomb 
(MDE); Four (4) MS–110 Reconnaissance Pod 
Retrofit Kits (non-MDE); Two (2) Transport-
able Ground Station Upgrades (non-MDE); 
One (1) Fixed Ground Station Upgrade (non- 
MDE); and associated spares; systems/mate-
riel; support; and services. These additional 
MDE and non-MDE items are valued at $35 
million in MDE and $220 million in non-MDE. 
However, the total estimated case value will 
remain $21.1 billion. 
(iv) Significance: This notification is being 
provided to report the inclusion of MDE that 
were not enumerated at the time ofthe origi-
nal notification. Inclusion of these items of 
MDE/non-MDE results in an increase in ca-
pability over what was originally notified. 
This equipment will support the requested 
weapon system, support the capabilities of 
Qatar’s F–15QA fleet, and contribute to 
interoperability with the United States. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives of the United States. Qatar is 
an important force for political stability and 
economic progress in the Arabian Gulf re-
gion. The procurement of SDBs, MS–110 Ret-
rofit Kits, and associated materiel/services 
will significantly improve Qatar’s defense 
capabilities to meet current and future 
threats and deter regional aggression. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The GBU–39/B Small Diameter Bomb In-
crement I (SDB I) is a 250-pound weapon de-
signed as a small, all weather, autonomous, 
conventional, air-to-ground, precision glide 
weapon able to strike fixed and stationary 
re-locatable targets from standoff range. The 
SDB I weapon system consists of the weap-
ons, the BRU–61/A (4-place pneumatic car-
riage system), shipping and handling con-
tainers for a single weapon and the BRU–61/ 
A either empty or loaded, and a weapon plan-
ning module. It has integrated diamond-back 
type wings that deploy after release, which 
increase the glide time and therefore max-
imum range. The SDB I Anti-Jam Global Po-
sitioning System aided Inertial Navigation 
System (AJGPS/INS) provides guidance to 
the coordinates of a stationary target. The 
payload/warhead is a very effective multi-
purpose penetrating and blast fragmentation 
warhead couples with a cockpit selectable 
electronic fuze. Its size and accuracy allow 
for an effective munition with less collateral 
damage. A proximity sensor provides height 
of burst capability. 
2. An MS–110 Retrofit kit converts a DB– 
110 into an MS–110. The MS–110 is a NonPro-
gram of Record tactical reconnaissance pod 
with long range, day/night, multispectral 
sensor technology. The multi-spectral sensor 
lets. the end user see color and better distin-
guish subtle features that a DB–1 l0’s dual 
band imagery cannot. The pod can transmit 
imagery via a datalink to ground-stations 
for near-real time analysis and exploitation. 
The pod is designed for carriage on fighter 
jets. There are no advanced technologies in 
the system, subsystems, equipment or tech-
nical manuals that could be exploited by a 
technologically-advanced adversary. 
The 
highest 
level 
of 
classification 
ofdefense articles, components, and services 
included in this potential sale is SECRET.

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, S. 
Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022 con-
gressional budget resolution, included 
a reserve fund in section 3003 to allow 
the chairman of the Senate Committee 
on the Budget to revise budget aggre-
gates, 
committee 
allocations, 
and 
make adjustments to the pay-as-you-go 
ledger for legislation that would not 
increase the deficit over the period of 
fiscal years 2022 to 2031. 
The Senate will soon consider S. 610, 
the Protecting Medicare and American 
Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, as 
amended by the House, which meets 
the condition of being paid for and not 
increasing the deficit over the 10-year 
period. As such, I am filing a revision 
to the aggregates and committee allo-
cations under the budget resolution, 
which were filed on September 23. Spe-
cifically, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice estimates that S. 610 will increase 
budget authority in 2022 by $7.65 billion 
and outlays by $7.144 billion. Over 5 
years, budget authority and outlays 
will increase by $7.079 billion, while 
there is no net increase to outlays over 
the 10-year period. I am increasing the 
aggregate amount of budget authority 
and outlays for 2022, as well as the allo-
cation to the Committee on Finance 
and the Senate pay-as-you-go ledger, 
by those amounts. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

CONFIRMATION OF C.B. 
SULLENBERGER III 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, On Decem-
ber 2, 2021, the Senate confirmed C.B. 
Sullenberger III to be Representative 
of the United States to the Inter-
national Civil Aviation Union—ICAO— 
with the rank of Ambassador. After re-
ceiving responses to a series of written 
questions to the nominee, I remain 
concerned about this nominee’s ap-
proach to the Ambassador position. 
In response to questions on balancing 
regulation with the need for an open 
environment 
for 
innovation, 
Mr. 
Sullenberger emphasized a position 
that favored more regulation at the ex-
pense of innovation, as well as def-
erence to standards established inter-
nationally rather than those generated 
in the U.S. I do not disagree with the 
need for essential safety standards to 
protect the flying public; however, I be-
lieve Mr. Sullenberger’s views cross a 
threshold in which the automatic pref-
erence for government regulation, par-
ticularly 
international 
government 
regulation, risks stunting the growth 
of aviation startups in emerging tech-
nology, entrench the largest players, 
and result in the exclusion of State and 
local jurisdictions from conversations 
in emerging areas of unmanned flight 
below the airspace of manned aviation. 
Finally, based on Mr. Sullenberger’s 
responses, I am not convinced that he 
would 
properly 
advocate 
that 
the 
United States lead at ICAO in setting 
standards that would swiftly bring 
civil supersonic air travel to fruition. 
For these reasons, I did not offer my 
consent to confirm Mr. Sullenberger 
unanimously and instead requested a 
voice vote. 
DEMOCRACY SUMMIT 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today—on International Anti-Corrup-
tion Day, as declared by the United Na-
tions—to speak about the Democracy 
Summit that President Biden is con-
vening today and tomorrow, to which 
government leaders from 110 countries 
have been invited. It will also include a 
range of leading civil society actors, 
business and labor leaders, civic edu-
cators and investigative journalists, 
philanthropists, and nonprofit leaders 
as speakers and participants. 
Undeterred by the Coronavirus pan-
demic, the Biden administration has 
organized a global virtual gathering 
with participants tuning in from six 
continents. It is an ambitious, even au-
dacious, undertaking. 
And it comes at a critical time, as 
the world is now 15 years into a global 
democratic recession, according to the 
well-respected watchdog organization 
Freedom House. In its widely cited an-
nual survey of freedom, it has reported 
that, in each of the past 15 years, more 
countries have seen their democracy 
scores decline than the number of 
countries whose scores have improved. 
And last year, during the height of the 
global pandemic, nearly 75 percent of 
the world’s population lived in a coun-
try that saw its democracy score dete-
riorate last year. 
For a President who has pledged to 
put democratic values at the heart of 
American foreign policy, it is fitting 
and proper that he should convene the 
democratic leaders of the world and 
other relevant parties to plan the revi-
talization of global democracy. 
Of course, readers of the annual Free-
dom House assessment will know that 
there are not 110 well-functioning, ef-
fective democracies in the world and 
that way too many poorly performing 
nominal democracies have been invited 
to this gathering, thus diluting its 
character. 
While some conspicuously back-slid-
ing countries, like Hungary and Tur-
key, have not been invited, there are 
numerous back-sliding pseudo-democ-
racies, including the current govern-
ments of the Philippines and Pakistan, 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
and Zambia, Bolsinaro’s Brazil among 
others, that unfortunately have been 
included. 
Then there is India, which dropped 
from Free to Partly Free status in 
Freedom in the World 2021, which con-
tributes significantly to the fact that 
75 percent of the world’s people last 
year resided in countries moving away 
from democracy. Yet the government 
of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after 
its sustained crack down on critics dur-
ing the past 2 years and the atrocious 
scapegoating of Muslims, who were dis-
proportionately blamed for the spread 
of the virus and faced attacks by vigi-
lante mobs, has been invited to the De-
mocracy Summit. 
Members of the Senate will also 
know that there has been precious lit-
tle information sharing with this body 
about the contours of the summit. 
There has been no discussion with us 
about the invitation list or the way 
forward from this week’s summit, 
which I see as a missed opportunity for 
the Biden administration. 
On the other hand, I was proud to be 
able to participate in a side event con-
vened last Friday morning by the 
House Democracy Partnership for a 
discussion with legislators from other 
countries about the important role 
that parliaments can and do play in 
leading their governments to address 
the enduring and universal problem of 
corruption. I want to congratulate 
Representative DAVID PRICE of North 
Carolina for his leadership of that im-
portant initiative and for convening a 
productive international exchange of 
views last week in the run up to the 
President’s gathering. One of the main 
take-aways from that webinar was that 
it is always incumbent on the legisla-
tures of the world to press forward with 
laws that instruct and enable executive 
branch officials to elevate their work 
to combat corruption. 
This is the main topic of my inter-
vention today, to discuss one of the 
hopeful aspects of the President’s De-
mocracy Summit, which is the central 
role that the battle against corruption 
is playing in the proceedings and to un-
derscore the leading role that we in the 
Congress must take to compel further 
action from our colleagues in the exec-
utive branch. 
History tells us that they will likely 
not do so on their own. In fact, the his-
tory of anti-corruption laws in the 
United States is replete with fervent 
opposition from the executive branch, 
whether during Democratic adminis-
trations or Republican, to virtually 
every measure proposed in the Con-
gress. This was true of the Foreign Cor-
rupt Practices Act of 1977, which 
barred U.S. companies and their offi-
cials from paying bribes in foreign 
countries. The executive and the busi-
ness community declared that this 
would end the ability of American cor-
porations to do business around the 
world, which turned out not to be true, 
of course. 
Indeed, it became in due course a 
foundational element in the United Na-
tions Convention Against Corruption— 
UNCAC—and other elements of the 
international architecture of the battle 
against corruption. 
Yet the executive has continued to 
oppose every measure introduced in 
Congress to address kleptocrats and 
human rights abusers, including the 
original Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law 
Accountability Act of 2012 and its suc-
cessor, the Global Magnitsky Human 
Rights Accountability Act of 2016. 
This is especially ironic because, 
since the enactment of the 2016 law, 
both Republican and Democratic ad-
ministrations have been utilizing the 
law frequently and to good effect. In-
deed, today, Secretary of State Tony 
Blinken announced that—on the occa-
sion of International anti-Corruption

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9089 
December 9, 2021 
Day—the Department of State has des-
ignated 12 individuals from 7 countries 
for significant corruption and also 
named another 18 family members. In 
five of the designations, the Treasury 
Department 
has 
invoked 
Global 
Magnitsky sanctions for their roles in 
corruption. 
The Democracy Summit is being 
built around three principal themes: 
defending 
against 
authoritarianism, 
promoting respect for human rights, 
and fighting corruption. Corruption is 
the 
means 
and 
the 
method 
for 
kleptocratic rulers around the world to 
steal from their own people and to 
stash their wealth in safe havens, most 
often in the democratic Western world. 
This is directly and intimately con-
nected to the undermining of the rule 
of law and the repression of human 
rights in these same countries—which 
is why I was so pleased to see that, on 
June 3 of this year, President Biden de-
clared the fight against corruption to 
be ‘‘a core national security interest.’’ 
And he directed his National Security 
Advisor to develop a comprehensive 
strategy to address the problem. 
Accordingly, earlier this week, in the 
run-up to the Democracy Summit, the 
White 
House 
published 
the 
first 
‘‘United States Strategy on Countering 
Corruption.’’ 
The strategy is a 38-page document 
that describes several major lines of ef-
fort in the new strategy. Among the 
document’s commitments are pledges 
to crack down on dirty money in U.S. 
real estate, to require certain gate-
keepers to the U.S. financial system 
such as attorneys, accountants, and in-
vestment advisers to perform greater 
due diligence on their prospective cli-
ents, and to make it a crime for foreign 
officials to solicit or accept bribes from 
U.S. companies. 
If this strategy is matched with ap-
propriate resources, it has the power to 
fundamentally change the calculus for 
kleptocrats and redirect stolen funds 
back to the original problems they 
were meant to fund such as fighting 
the pandemic, countering the effects of 
climate change, funding economic de-
velopment and opportunity. 
We in the Congress can do our part 
by passing pending legislation that 
would further strengthen the hand of 
the U.S. Government in this effort. 
While there are a number of valuable 
proposals pending, there are two that I 
suggest would be the most impactful 
and necessary. 
The first is the Combating Global 
Corruption Act, S. 14, which I intro-
duced and was cosponsored by my Re-
publican 
friend 
from 
Indiana, 
Mr. 
YOUNG, which would create an annual 
global report, modeled in some ways on 
the Trafficking-in-Persons report, in 
which the State Department would as-
sess how earnestly and effectively the 
governments of the world are living up 
to the commitments they have made in 
international treaties and covenants. 
The report would also place the coun-
tries of the world in 3 tiers, according 
to how well they are doing. And for 
those in the lowest performing tier, 
likely the governments that are actu-
ally kleptocracies, the bill asks that 
the executive branch assess govern-
ment officials in those places for pos-
sible designation for Global Magnitsky 
sanctions. 
The second is the Global Magnitsky 
Human Rights Accountability Act, S. 
93, which I introduced and was cospon-
sored by my Republican friend from 
Mississippi, Mr. WICKER, which would 
permanently reauthorize the existing 
Global Magnitsky framework and to 
widen the aperture of the law to en-
compass more bad actors and actions. 
Both these measures have been re-
ported favorably and unanimously by 
the Senate Committee on Foreign Re-
lations, and both are ready for final ac-
tion by the Senate. As President Biden 
convenes 
the 
Democracy 
Summit 
today, with its major focus on the bat-
tle against corruption, it would be 
timely for the Senate to demonstrate 
our resolve as well. 
So I hope that my colleagues here in 
the Senate will agree in the coming 
days to adopt these two bills, so that 
we may take them to the House of Rep-
resentatives, where they also enjoy bi-
partisan support, and get them onto 
the desk of President Biden during the 
coming year. Participating govern-
ments in the Democracy Summit, in-
cluding the United States, are making 
commitments to strengthen their own 
democracies in the next 12 months, in 
advance of a second summit that is en-
visioned for next December. 
The American position will be en-
hanced if we have enacted these laws 
before then. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that selected excerpts of the 
‘‘United States Strategy on Countering 
Corruption’’ be printed in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

Introduction 
When government officials abuse public 
power for private gain, they do more than 
simply appropriate illicit wealth. Corruption 
robs citizens of equal access to vital services, 
denying the right to quality healthcare, pub-
lic safety, and education. It degrades the 
business environment, subverts economic op-
portunity, and exacerbates inequality. It 
often contributes to human rights violations 
and abuses, and can drive migration. As a 
fundamental threat to the rule of law, cor-
ruption hollows out institutions, corrodes 
public trust, and fuels popular cynicism to-
ward effective, accountable governance. 
Moreover, the impacts of corruption fre-
quently reverberate far beyond the imme-
diate environment in which the acts take 
place. In today’s globalized world, corrupt 
actors bribe across borders, harness the 
international financial system to stash il-
licit wealth abroad, and abuse democratic in-
stitutions to advance anti-democratic aims. 
Emerging research and major journalistic 
exposes have documented the extent to 
which legal and regulatory deficiencies in 
the developed world offer corrupt actors the 
means to offshore and launder illicit wealth. 
This dynamic in turn strengthens the hand 
of those autocratic leaders whose rule is 
predicated on the ability to co-opt and re-
ward elites. 
On June 3, 2021, President Biden estab-
lished the fight against corruption as a core 
national security interest of the United 
States. As he wrote in National Security 
Study Memorandum-I (NSSM–1), ‘‘corruption 
threatens United States national security, 
economic equity, global antipoverty and de-
velopment efforts, and democracy itself. . . . 
[B]y effectively preventing and countering 
corruption and demonstrating the advan-
tages of transparent and accountable govern-
ance, we can secure a critical advantage for 
the United States and other democracies.’’ 
Pursuant to NSSM–1, Federal departments 
and agencies have conducted an interagency 
review to take stock of existing U.S. Govern-
ment anti-corruption efforts and to identify 
and seek to rectify persistent gaps in the 
fight against corruption. In parallel with 
this review, departments and agencies have 
begun to accelerate and amplify their efforts 
to prevent and combat corruption at home 
and abroad; bring transparency to the United 
States’ and international financial systems; 
and make it increasingly difficult for cor-
rupt actors to shield their activities. 
This first United States Strategy on Coun-
tering Corruption builds on the findings of 
the review and lays out a comprehensive ap-
proach for how the United States will work 
domestically and internationally, with gov-
ernmental and non-governmental partners, 
to prevent, limit, and respond to corruption 
and related crimes. The Strategy places spe-
cial emphasis on the transnational dimen-
sions of the challenges posed by corruption, 
including by recognizing the ways in which 
corrupt actors have used the U.S. financial 
system and other rule-of-law based systems 
to launder their ill-gotten gains. 
To curb corruption and its deleterious ef-
fects, the U.S. Government will organize its 
efforts around five mutually reinforcing pil-
lars of work: 
Modernizing, coordinating, and resourcing 
U.S. Government efforts to fight corruption; 
Curbing illicit finance; 
Holding corrupt actors accountable; 
Preserving and strengthening the multilat-
eral anti-corruption architecture; and, 
Improving 
diplomatic 
engagement 
and 
leveraging foreign assistance resources to 
advance policy goals. 
By pursuing concrete lines of effort that 
advance strategic objectives under each of 
these pillars, and integrating anti-corruption 
efforts into relevant policy-making proc-
esses, the United States intends to lead in 
promoting prosperity and security for the 
American people and people around the 
world. 
The Impacts of Corruption 
From the small-town hospital adminis-
trator who demands bribes in exchange for 
life-saving services, to the globe-trotting 
kleptocrat who offshores an embezzled for-
tune, corruption harms both individuals and 
societies. The effects of corrupt acts are fre-
quently both direct and indirect. When gov-
ernment officials steal from public coffers or 
fix a contract to reward a political crony, 
these actors directly transfer funding from 
essential services to private interests. Cor-
ruption also indirectly contributes to re-
duced public trust in state institutions, 
which in turn can add to the appeal of

illiberal actors who exploit popular griev-
ances for political advantage. 
Whether grand corruption perpetrated by 
powerful elites, or administrative corruption 
carried out by lower-level officials inter-
acting directly with the public, corrupt acts 
harm the public interest, hamper countries’ 
development, and diminish state capacity. 
Corruption has been shown to significantly 
curtail the ability of states to respond effec-
tively to public health crises and to address 
climate change, migration, and inequities of 
all forms, while contributing to state fra-
gility. Countries with high levels of corrup-
tion are more likely to have populations 
that suffer from human rights abuses, and 
are less likely to address those abuses. And 
states with endemic corruption are more vul-
nerable to terrorist networks, transnational 
organized and gang-related criminals, and 
human traffickers. 
Corruption’s increasingly globalized na-
ture—fueled in part by transnational illicit 
finance and criminal networks, as well as ex-
ploitation of the licit financial system—im-
poses steep costs on ordinary citizens and 
good 
governance 
alike. 
In 
particular, 
transnational corruption driven by political 
and economic elites with the aid of complicit 
financial and legal service providers under-
mines lower income countries’ ability to ad-
vance the welfare of their citizens and per-
petuates aid dependency. According to the 
United Nations Conference on Trade and De-
velopment’s Economic Development in Afri-
ca Report 2020, for example, every year an es-
timated $88.6 billion—equivalent to 3.7 per-
cent of Africa’s GDP—leaves the continent 
in the form of illicit capital flight. 
Corrupt actors exploit deficiencies in anti- 
money laundering and countering the financ-
ing of terrorism (AML/CFT) systems and 
processes—as well as in other critical trans-
parency, reporting, business, real estate, and 
tax regimes—to use public contracting, con-
cessions, and procurement processes for per-
sonal enrichment. Corrupt elites and non- 
state 
armed 
groups 
enrich 
themselves 
through illicit proceeds and trade of high- 
value commodities, including gold, wildlife, 
timber, petroleum, and other natural re-
sources. Across an ever-more connected and 
digital world, corrupt actors exploit over-
sight and regulatory weaknesses in jurisdic-
tions around the world to divert and hide the 
proceeds of their acts. And by leaving their 
financial systems vulnerable to illicit as-
sets—through anonymous shell companies, 
opaque transactions, and under-regulated 
professional service providers—rule-of-law- 
based societies continue to provide entry 
points for corrupt actors to launder their 
funds and their reputations. Such activity 
negatively impacts average citizens in the 
United States, tilting the economic playing 
field against working Americans, enabling 
criminals to flourish and foreign adversaries 
to subversively peddle their influence, per-
petuating growth-dampening inequality, and 
contributing to pricing out families from 
home ownership through real estate pur-
chases. 
In parallel, authoritarian regimes and 
their proxies have been shown to engage in 
bribery and other corrupt acts as a means to 
advance their strategic goals, while exploit-
ing the international financial system to off-
shore illicit gains, and influence elections 
and policies in democratic states. Corruption 
in the form of state-directed cross-border in-
vestments from authoritarian states, for ex-
ample, has had a corrosive effect on institu-
tions in developing countries. Such practices 
harm the competitive landscape of financial 
markets, and often have long-term corrosive 
impacts on governance and human rights 
standards. The U.S. Government will con-
tinue to study the weaponization of corrup-
tion to understand its use and impacts on 
the United States, other democracies, and 
countries around the world, as well as how to 
thwart and build resilience against this 
evolving threat. 
While the U.S. Government has long recog-
nized countering corruption as an important 
foreign policy goal, a growing understanding 
of corruption’s strategic impact and the in-
creasing interconnectedness of the global 
economy underscores the need for a new ap-
proach. For the U.S. Government to effec-
tively counter contemporary corruption, we 
must recognize the transnational dimensions 
of the challenge, and respond in a manner 
that is both systemic and tailored to local 
conditions. Doing so will require addressing 
vulnerabilities in the U.S. and international 
financial systems; bolstering international 
best practices, regulations, and enforcement 
efforts; supporting the role of non-govern-
mental actors; building political will and 
recognizing when it is absent; and consist-
ently pursuing accountability through a 
combination of diplomatic engagement, for-
eign assistance, and enforcement actions. 
The United States will continue to evalu-
ate and implement measures as needed to 
further safeguard our financial system, and 
will work with like-minded partners and rel-
evant multilateral institutions to do the 
same. We will make it harder to hide the 
proceeds of ill-gotten wealth in opaque cor-
porate structures, reduce the ability of indi-
viduals involved in corrupt acts to launder 
funds through anonymous purchases of U.S. 
real estate, and bolster asset recovery and 
seizure activities. We will innovate, adapt, 
partner, and learn, so as to maximize the po-
tential for diplomatic tools, including for-
eign assistance and targeted sanctions, to 
stem corruption and to hold corrupt actors 
accountable, while expanding efforts to en-
sure that foreign assistance and engagement 
do not inadvertently contribute to corrupt 
practices. And we will continue to vigorously 
enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
(FCPA) and other statutory and regulatory 
regimes via criminal and civil enforcement 
actions. 
Countering corruption is not a simple task. 
Changing embedded cultures of corruption 
requires 
significant 
political 
will, 
and 
achieving sustained progress can take dec-
ades. Positive change requires consistent 
leadership, public accountability, an empow-
ered and impartial judiciary, and a diverse 
and independent media. Mindful of these re-
alities, the United States will increase sup-
port to state and non-state partners com-
mitted to reform, boost the capacity of other 
governments to tackle corruption, and em-
power those, including activists, investiga-
tive journalists, and law enforcement on the 
front lines of exposing corrupt acts. We will 
bolster and promote public-private partner-
ships to more consistently bring in the pri-
vate sector as critical actors in the fight 
against corruption, help level the playing 
field and improve the international business 
climate, and lead in international fora as we 
work to curb the ability of actors to hide ill- 
gotten wealth behind anonymity. Our closest 
engagement will be with our most com-
mitted allies and partners, including with re-
spect to the influence of strategic corruption 
deliberately employed by authoritarian gov-
ernments. 
Illustrative Types of Corruption 
Corruption takes on many forms and is 
used to further various illicit behaviors. Il-
lustrative types of corruption include, but 
are not limited to: 
Grand corruption: when political elites 
steal large sums of public funds or otherwise 
abuse power for personal or political advan-
tage. 
Administrative corruption: the abuse of 
entrusted power for private gain—usually by 
low to mid-level government officials—in 
interactions with citizens and the private 
sector, including to skirt official regulations 
and extort citizens in exchange for their 
basic services. 
Kleptocracy: a government controlled by 
officials who use political power to appro-
priate the wealth of their nation. Can in-
clude state capture. 
State capture: when private entities im-
properly and corruptly influence a country’s 
decision-making process for their own ben-
efit. 
Strategic corruption: when a government 
weaponizes corrupt practices as a tenet of its 
foreign policy.

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND CUBA 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have an NJ.com 
article by Roland Armando Alum, ti-
tled ‘‘Opinion: Six Decades After Dic-
tator’s Assassination, Dominican Re-
public Flourishes While Cuba Is Miser-
able’’ be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
SIX DECADES AFTER DICTATOR’S ASSASSINA-
TION, 
DOMINICAN
REPUBLIC
FLOURISHES 
WHILE CUBA IS MISERABLE 
(By Roland Armando Alum) 
As we commemorate Memorial Day this 
weekend in the U.S., the Dominican Repub-
lic’s people mark 60 years since the fall of 
Rafael Trujillo’s dictatorship on May 30, 
1961. Considered Latin-America’s bloodiest 
dictator, Trujillo beleaguered Dominicans 
for 31 years, until a patriots’ cabal executed 
him with the secret assistance of U.S. offi-
cials. 
Up to the 1959 rise of the Fidel & Rau´ l Cas-
tro brothers in Cuba, Trujillo was un-
matched as the despotic model in the Amer-
icas, as historian Lauren Derby noted in 
‘‘The Dictator’s Seduction’’ (2009). It be-
hooves us to draw some chronological con-
trasts from both countries in the last six 
decades, developments that—incidentally— 
have affected our own local demographics. 
Indeed, northern New Jersey is home to 
sizable and dynamic Hispanic communities 
of Cubans and Dominicans; some of them 
have attained prominent positions in every 
walk of life (admittedly, sometimes to the 
chagrin of self-appointed ‘‘guardians-of-the- 
gate’’). 
Ironically, the geneses of the Dominican 
and 
Cuban 
emigration 
are 
opposite. 
Dominicans began to emigrate en masse 
after 1961, when freedom of movement be-
came guaranteed; while Cubans fled in dis-
approval of the Castros’ converting the pre-
vious Pearl of the Antilles into a bankrupt 
vassal state of the now defunct Soviet em-
pire. In summer–1980 alone, about 1.5 percent 
of Cuba’s population ‘‘voted with their feet’’ 
via the unprecedented Mariel Freedom Flo-
tilla, many of whose refugees and their de-
scendants flourished in this great Garden 
State of ours. 
Both countries emerged from traditional 
militaristic dictatorships around the same 
time, 1961 for the D.R., and 1959 for Cuba, 
after Afro-Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista 
fled the island-nation. Cuba’s undeniably re-
markable economic prosperity was accom-
plished despite Batista’s relatively brief 
authoritarianism (1952–58) and the pitfalls of 
the preceding 1902–1952 republican epoch. 
Conversely, conditions were wretched in 
the D.R. while Trujillo was ruling the coun-
try as a private fiefdom. The instability that

followed ended with the U.S. military inter-
vention that eventually fostered a classic 
tripartite constitutional government, with 
multiple competing political parties alter-
nating in power. Moreover, the jobs-creating 
business sector and the labor movement 
thrive. A year ago, Dominicans elected their 
eighth post-Trujillo president: successful 
businessman Luis Abinader (born in 1967), 
D.R.’s first chief executive born after Tru-
jillo’s downfall. 
All this sharply contrasts with socialist 
Cuba, a stagnant, closed society controlled 
by the Castro family and its hand-picked, 
mostly military, non-elected cronies still 
chanting discredited Marxist slogans. True, 
the Castros counted on initial popular sup-
port, but it soon vanished as they hijacked 
the liberal-inspired anti-Batista political re-
bellion and turned Cuba into a nightmarish 
dystopia. While the D.R. steered toward the 
Open Society ideal, Cuba rushed in the oppo-
site direction with the Castros’ tropical 
version of the failed Soviet-Russian mold. 
Dictatorships of all genres customarily at-
tract foreign apologists who, comfortably 
from abroad, extol alleged relative achieve-
ments. Trujillo, who even received an hon-
orary doctorate from a U.S. university, was 
praised by the same New York Times that 
characteristically propagates ridiculous ex-
cuses for Cuba’s oppressors. Likewise, the 
academic world brims with fake-news re-
ports intent on laundering the Castros’ fias-
cos, while also defaming Cuban-Americans. 
As we salute Dominicans upon their cele-
brating six decades free of despotism, one 
should commiserate with the Cuban people, 
still suffering three generations of ana-
chronic totalitarianism; in fact, so far over 
twice as long as Trujillo’s dictatorship 
lasted.

TRIBUTE TO DR. FRANCIS 
COLLINS 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to ask the Senate to join me in 
recognizing the incredible career of Dr. 
Francis Collins, Director of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, as he pre-
pares to step down as Director and re-
turn to his research laboratory at the 
National Human Genome Research In-
stitute, NHGRI. 
NIH is the crown jewel of our Na-
tion’s and the world’s biomedical infra-
structure. The Institute touches all of 
our lives through its research, which 
deepens our understanding of the nat-
ural 
world 
and 
produces 
ground-
breaking 
medicines 
and 
lifesaving 
treatments for diseases. Like all Mary-
landers, I am proud that NIH is 
headquartered in Bethesda and has sev-
eral satellite campuses throughout the 
State. 
Dr. Collins’ career with NIH has 
spanned more than three decades. A 
physician-geneticist, Dr. Collins served 
as the director of the National Human 
Genome Research Institute from 1993 
to 2008. In this work, he led the Human 
Genome Project, which in April 2003 
completed sequencing the human DNA 
instruction book. The sequencing of 
the 3 billion DNA letters that make up 
the human genetic ‘‘instruction book’’ 
has been instrumental in uncovering 
the role that the genome plays in 
human health and disease and marshal-
ling in a new era of medicine. For this 
work, Dr. Collins deservedly received 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 
2007. 
Dr. Collins is the longest serving, 
Presidentially appointed NIH Director, 
having served as the 16th Director of 
NIH under three U.S. Presidents over 
more than 12 years. Building on his 
groundbreaking research in genetics, 
Dr. Collins has led the Institutes in the 
effort to develop a greater under-
standing of medicine and pursue inno-
vations in diagnoses and treatments. 
This includes the ‘‘All of Us’’ pro-
gram, which is a precision medicine 
initiative that in 2018 began gathering 
the health data of 1 million partici-
pants 
to 
develop 
individualized 
healthcare that enables us to better 
treat and prevent disease. Dr. Collins’ 
leadership has similarly led to incred-
ible advancements in understanding 
neurological conditions. The Brain Re-
search through Advancing Innovative 
Neurotechnologies—BRAIN—Initiative 
aims to develop revolutionary pictures 
of the brain to enable researchers to 
find new ways to treat, cure, and even 
prevent neurological disorders that af-
fect millions of Americans. 
Dr. Collins’ tenure has included lead-
ing the fight to eradicate cancer under 
the Cancer Moonshot Initiative. This 
generational effort aims to improve 
our ability to prevent cancer or detect 
it at an earlier stage and develop more 
effective therapies to treat it. To date, 
over $1 billion in Moonshot funding has 
made incredible progress through sup-
port of over 240 research projects 
across more than 70 cancer initiatives. 
Last but certainly not least, Dr. Col-
lins’ leadership as NIH Director has 
witnessed one of the toughest and most 
challenging tests for the Institutes: the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Through Dr. Col-
lins’ commitment to adhering to the 
science and steadfast leadership, the 
NIH has played an historic role in shep-
herding the development of vaccines, 
therapeutics, diagnostics, and all man-
ner 
of 
medical 
resources 
toward 
COVID–19 response efforts. Though the 
Omicron variant is troubling and the 
pandemic rages in many parts of the 
world, we are better prepared to re-
spond 
and 
persevere 
against 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic because Dr. Collins 
played a principal role in leading our 
national biomedical response efforts. 
Dr. Collins is not just a scientist. He 
is also an avid guitarist and motorcy-
clist. And his book, ‘‘The Language of 
God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for 
Belief’’, is one of the most intellectu-
ally rigorous and compelling efforts to 
reconcile the worlds of science and 
faith. 
I ask the Senate, my fellow Mary-
landers, and a grateful Nation to join 
me in recognizing the career of an ex-
traordinary physician-geneticist, Dr. 
Francis Collins. We are incredibly 
grateful for his leadership and steward-
ship of NIH and wish him a happy and 
well-deserved return to his research 
laboratory. 
TRIBUTE TO DR. LOUIS UCCELLINI 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the up-
coming retirement on January 1, 2022, 
of a true public servant and leader, Dr. 
Louis Uccellini, Director of National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion’s National Weather Service. 
Louis is the epitome of a dedicated 
civil servant, having spent the past 43 
years of his career at both NOAA and 
NASA contributing to and leading the 
maturation and advancement of our 
Nation’s weather prediction capabili-
ties. Put simply, there is no aspect of 
today’s 
weather 
forecast 
that 
Dr. 
Uccellini hasn’t advanced during his 
storied career. 
But Louis’ contributions span far be-
yond science. Perhaps most notably, 
and certainly most visible to the pub-
lic, are the organizational changes 
Louis has made to National Weather 
Service since becoming Director in 
2013. The establishment and develop-
ment of the Weather-Ready Nation pro-
gram, a paradigm shift that refocused 
the entire NWS staff and mission, now 
enables forecasters to use weather in-
formation to deliver Impact-based De-
cision Support Services to emergency 
managers, which is empowering local 
officials to help citizens be ready, re-
sponsive 
and 
resilient 
to 
weather 
events. This is the real purpose of the 
weather forecast and is allowing the 
National Weather Service to better 
perform its mission of saving lives and 
protecting property. 
Louis’ mark on the National Weather 
Service will undoubtedly be felt for 
many years to come. On behalf of my 
constituents in Kansas and a grateful 
nation, I personally thank Dr. Louis 
Uccellini for his service to our Nation; 
wish him and his wife, Susan, well in 
retirement; and as Louis would say, 
‘‘I’ll leave it at that.’’

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO LEVILLE STEPHENS 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the 100th birthday 
of World War II veteran Leville Ste-
phens. 
I am proud to celebrate this mile-
stone and honor his service and sac-
rifice in our Nation’s uniform. 
Mr. Stephens answered the call to 
serve. He trained at Fort Huachuca in 
Arizona, one of 30,0000 African-Amer-
ican soldiers who prepared for battle at 
this location before deploying overseas. 
He was assigned to the 93rd Infantry 
Division and shipped to the Pacific the-
ater. 
As a private first class, Mr. Stephens 
served in a number of dangerous loca-
tions during the war, including the 
Philippines, New Guinea, and the Sol-
omon Islands. He was on his way to 
Japan when the United States dropped 
the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, bring-
ing about the Japanese surrender.

duty as a soldier.’’ He believed his job 
was to follow his orders and do what 
needed to be done. That attitude, 
shared by so many of his fellow soldiers 
among the Greatest Generation, helped 
the United States achieve victory and 
secure a desperately needed peace. 
He is rightfully proud of his service, 
alongside his family and friends among 
whom he also inspires admiration and 
gratitude by being a devoted husband 
to his wife Hattie and a dutiful father 
and grandfather. 
Mr. Stephens is a true American hero 
whose determination and dedication 
helped change the course of history. He 
answered his country’s call to arms 
with courage, bravery, and honor. Our 
Nation owes him a debt of gratitude for 
his efforts to defend the freedoms we 
hold dear and defeat tyranny around 
the globe. 
I am honored to recognize his serve 
and sacrifice, and wish him a very spe-
cial and wonderful 100th birthday.∑

RECOGNIZING THE PANCAKE 
PANTRY 
∑
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I 
wish to recognize the 60th anniversary 
and the opening of a new location of 
the legendary Pancake Pantry in Nash-
ville. 
On December 13, the Pancake Pantry, 
a Nashville staple and landmark res-
taurant, will open a second location to 
offer its famous varieties of pancakes 
as well as begin a partnership with the 
Nashville Predators Foundation to sup-
port local communities. 
Since 1961, this iconic restaurant has 
brightened the mornings of both tour-
ists and residents of the Music City and 
will now partner with the Nashville 
Predators Foundation to give back to 
the community. 
Through grants and partnerships di-
rected towards the educational, health, 
and 
social 
needs 
of 
Middle 
Ten-
nesseans, the Pancake Pantry is com-
mitted to supporting the local commu-
nity. 
To show their support, special ‘‘Nash-
ville Predator’’ pancakes will be avail-
able between January 1 and February 
28, 2022, and for each order sold, the 
Pancake Pantry will make a monetary 
donation to the Nashville Predators 
Foundation. 
Established on August 18, 2009, the 
Nashville Predators Foundation strives 
to meet the needs of the local commu-
nity by offering resources and financial 
support to youth-oriented organiza-
tions, awarding nearly $7.0 million to 
the greater Nashville community. Let 
us celebrate this announcement and 
commitment to helping those in need.∑

TRIBUTE TO MICHEAL MAHONEY 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize 
Micheal 
Mahoney 
of 
Kansas 
City. 
Micheal has been a reporter in the KC 
area for over 40 years, starting with 
breaking news, then making a career 
into politics with a fair, but always 
tough sensibility. 
I have known Mike for a few years 
now since coming to Congress, and to 
me, he has one of the best reputations 
among reporters in the region. The 
press and Congress are often thought of 
as adversaries, with journalists always 
trying to dig into Members to get the 
best scoop or ‘‘gotcha’’ moment, while 
Members are having to watch their 
backs. With Mike, that has never been 
the case. Sure, he would always try to 
dig, but that was simply to get the best 
possible info for Kansans, not just to 
put someone on the spot. Any time I 
had an interview with Mike, he truly 
was looking for the heart of a story, 
with no cheap tricks. He gave everyone 
involved a fair shot to tell their side 
and laid everything out crystal clear 
for viewers to see when the story came 
on. It is easy to see in each story what 
was really going on thanks to Mike’s 
integrity in interviews, and talent for 
storytelling. 
As he finishes out his time with 
KMBC, I hope he is able to reflect on 
the wonderful career he has had. He 
has been there to provide outstanding 
coverage of every political event in 
Kansas for all to see and even has an 
Emmy to his name for covering the 
1993 flooding along the Missouri River, 
along with a Mall Dodson National 
Headliners Award in 1981 for his cov-
erage of the Hyatt Regency Skywalk 
falling in KC. Furthermore, Mike has 
been on the board of the Kansas City 
St. Patrick’s Day Committee and has 
even been the grand marshal for the St. 
Patrick’s Day parade. Through it all, 
he has been one of KC’s finest. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing 
the wonderful career of Mr. Micheal 
Mahoney and wish him nothing but joy 
and happiness in his next chapter of 
life.∑

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. CASEY): 
S. 3360. A bill to reauthorize title II 
of the Higher Education Act of 1965, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, it is time 
for a national investment in building a 
strong and resilient educator pipeline 
to ensure that all schools have the di-
verse, profession-ready teachers, prin-
cipals, librarians, counselors, and other 
specialized instructional support per-
sonnel they need to support student de-
velopment and academic achievement. 
Today, along with Senator Bob Casey 
and Representative Alma Adams, I am 
introducing the Educators for America 
Act to provide the blueprint for build-
ing this pipeline. 
For years, we have seen declines in 
enrollment in educator preparation 
programs. Now in the wake of the pan-
demic, schools are facing pervasive 
staffing shortages. An Education Week 
survey found 40 percent of district lead-
ers and principals describe the short-
ages as ‘‘severe’’ or ‘‘very severe.’’ The 
National 
Association 
of 
Secondary 
School Principals reported that nearly 
4 out of 10 principals are expecting to 
leave the profession in the next 3 years. 
Moreover, the gap between the demo-
graphic makeup of the student body 
and the education profession is wid-
ening. Even though over 50 percent of 
students are people of color and that 
multiple studies have shown that ra-
cial diversity can provide significant 
benefits to students, a 2016 Department 
of Education report showed that 82 per-
cent of public school teachers identi-
fied as White, a figure that had barely 
changed since 2000. 
Simply put, we can no longer afford 
to neglect the educator pipeline. 
The Educators for America Act calls 
for a $1 billion annual investment in 
the educator pipeline, divided evenly 
between State capacity building and 
direct support for educator preparation 
programs and partnerships with high 
need school districts. It addresses the 
full pipeline from early outreach and 
career exploration to financial assist-
ance and wraparound supports for 
those pursuing education careers to 
clinical preparation for teachers, prin-
cipals, and other educators to faculty 
development, all with a focus on ensur-
ing equity and diversity. 
Just as importantly, the Educators 
for America Act will reduce financial 
barriers to pursuing careers in edu-
cation. The legislation will double the 
value of the TEACH grant to $8,000 per 
year and provide greater flexibility for 
meeting the service requirements. It 
establishes a new monthly credit for 
teachers, principals, and other edu-
cators towards repayment on their stu-
dent loans so they earn loan forgive-
ness as they serve rather than watch-
ing their loan balances stagnate or 
grow for 5 to 10 years before receiving 
any benefit. 
The Educators for America Act re-
flects the input from stakeholders 
across the education field about what 
is needed to recruit, prepare, and sup-
port educators. To date, 45 organiza-
tions have endorsed it. 
The Nation’s outlook for the future 
is tied to the strength of the education 
profession. Our economic prosperity, 
the health of our democracy and civic 
society, and our ability to meet the 
challenges of climate change and the 
information age depend on our stu-
dents having access to well-prepared 
and supported educators who reflect 
the diversity of the students they 
serve. 
Today, the profession is in crisis. It 
is time to act. I urge my colleagues to 
cosponsor the Educators for America 
Act and work with me to get it passed 
into law. 
By Mr. CORNYN: 
S. 3368. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs to submit to 
Congress a report on the Veterans Inte-
gration to Academic Leadership pro-
gram of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have my bill 
printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
The bill requires the Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs to submit to Congress a 
report on the Veterans Integration to 
Academic Leadership Program of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows:

GROUND-BASED AIR TRAFFIC 
MANAGEMENT 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to engage with my colleague, Rep-
resentative RICK LARSEN, the Chair of the 
House Transportation and Infrastructure Sub-
committee on Aviation. 
I thank Representative LARSEN for his hard 
work to ensure that aviation priorities were in-
cluded in the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act. I am concerned about the many 
ground-based air traffic management systems 
that are now operating well beyond their 
planned service life. This includes the Federal 
Aviation Administration’s (FAA) network of 
more than 2,700 navigation and landing sys-
tems located at more than 1,500 sites in all 50 
states. For the last 20 years, the FAA has 
been systematically dedicated to the imple-
mentation of NextGen to enable more efficient 
flight operations in the National Airspace Sys-
tem. During this period, investment has shifted 
away from legacy ground-based air traffic con-
trol infrastructure. It is important for us all to 
recognize that aging electronic systems can-
not be sustained indefinitely. I am concerned 
that accelerating rates of component failures 
combined with parts obsolescence creates a 
risk of field failures that would threaten avia-
tion safety and the flying public. 
I am pleased that Division J, Title VIII of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act pro-
vides $5 billion over 5 years for the FAA’s Fa-
cilities and Equipment account. Included in 
this amount is funding to address investment 
and modernization shortfalls in ground-based 
aviation infrastructure, including landing and 
navigational aids. These systems are critical to 
maintaining safety in the national airspace and 
providing operational resiliency. 
Representative LARSEN, I am glad that the 
bill reflects our shared priorities of providing 
more funding to the FAA’s Facilities and 
Equipment budget and I want to be certain 
that a proportionate amount is spent on mod-
ernization of crucial infrastructure, such as 
lighting and landing systems. Is it your under-
standing that this is consistent with the intent 
of the committee? Can we continue to work to 
ensure that the U.S. Department of Transpor-
tation’s 2022 spend plan reflects these con-
gressional priorities?

GROUND-BASED AIR TRAFFIC 
MANAGEMENT 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I share the concerns of my friend from 
Kansas regarding the need to upgrade the Na-
tion’s ground-based aviation infrastructure in a 
much timelier fashion. Aviation is a part of the 
backbone of the U.S. economy and keeping 
all aspects of the system up to date is essen-
tial to continued growth and quality of life for 
all Americans. The backlog of ground-based 
navigation aids that are currently operating 
past their useful life is real. In fact, at the cur-
rent slow pace of modernization, some of 
these systems will be more than 100 years old 
by the time they are replaced. 
As Chair of the Transportation and Infra-
structure Subcommittee on Aviation, I am 
committed to addressing this issue before it 
becomes a crisis for the aviation system. The 
funding in the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act will give the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration (FAA) the tools it needs to make sig-
nificant improvements in the safety and reli-
ability of critical ground-based infrastructure by 
acquiring, installing, and commissioning new 
instrument landing systems; distance meas-
uring equipment; tactical air navigation equip-
ment; runway lighting systems; and very high 
frequency omni-range equipment. Further, this 
funding supports the FAA’s administrative ex-
penses, including salaries, giving the agency 
the flexibility to bolster its workforce and im-
plement innovative solutions to accelerate the 
modernization of these systems. 
Ensuring the safety and reliability of the Na-
tion’s ground-based aviation infrastructure is a 
priority of the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee, and I am committed to working 
with Representative DAVIDS on this issue as 
we move forward, including oversight on the 
U.S. Department of Transportation spend plan.

pertise he rose to the position of Deputy to the 
Commander in 2013. 
Today, I am proud to recognize Mr. Averill 
for his continued service to our Nation and the 
people of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional 
District. 
I thank him, and may God continue to bless 
the United States of America.

Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, today, we 
honor Ms. Shasta Shaffer, the director of con-
stituent services for Florida’s 9th Congres-
sional District. Throughout her years of public 
service, Shasta has gone above and beyond 
to help Central Floridians in need. As a para-
legal for the law office of Darren M. Soto dur-
ing his tenure in the Florida Legislature, she 
worked tirelessly to help clients navigate their 
legal matters. Once Congressman Soto was 
elected to the House of Representatives, 
Shasta embarked on the journey to Congress. 
It was quickly discovered that public service 
came naturally to Shasta, and she was pro-
moted to lead the constituent services depart-
ment during the 115th Congress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1346 
December 9, 2021 
After Hurricane Maria devastated the island 
of Puerto Rico, tens of thousands of families 
were forced to flee and sought refuge in Flor-
ida’s 9th Congressional District. Without hesi-
tation, Shasta worked with local stakeholders 
to provide shelter, food, and stability for those 
in need. 
As the daughter of a Vietnam War veteran, 
Shasta worked especially hard to help vet-
erans and young people applying to the five 
military academies. For five years, Shasta led 
the efforts for Florida’s 9th Congressional Dis-
trict’s Service Academy nominations and took 
great pride in selecting members for the mili-
tary advisory board. Several students have 
been admitted under her tenure. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, she was 
instrumental in helping constituents, within and 
outside of the district, with unemployment and 
IRS issues. Because of her efforts, thousands 
of families received much-needed relief during 
a historically tumultuous time. 
For this and more, we honor Ms. Shasta 
Shaffer.

FAREWELL TO MS. JODI B. 
MITCHELL 
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker, 
today I honor a superb leader and Army liai-
son for her tireless commitment to the United 
States Army with over 14 years of service to 
the Nation serving in the Army Office of the 
Legislative Liaison, culminating as the Deputy 
Division Chief of the Army House Liaison Divi-
sion. As Ms. Jodi Mitchell transitions to her 
next assignment as a Department of the Army 
Civilian, I believe it is fitting to recognize her 
dedication to fostering the relationship be-
tween the United States Army and this Cham-
ber. 
Ms. Mitchell’s commitment to service and 
leader development enabled her to excel in 
numerous leadership positions throughout her 
time serving as a Department of the Army Ci-
vilian. Over the course of 14 years, while serv-
ing in many key legislative liaison assign-
ments, she has continued the tradition of 
strengthening the relationships between Mem-
bers of Congress and their staffs with the 
United States Army. 
Ms. Mitchell’s relentless commitment proved 
invaluable in providing support to the House of 
Representatives and our constituents. She has 
spent countless hours ensuring our Members 
were educated on Army combat systems, 
modernization programs and policy initiatives. 
She also managed and led multiple Congres-
sional Delegations to various locations around 
the globe. Ms. Mitchell has become a trusted 
adviser and friend to many of us, distin-
guishing herself by continuously going above 
and beyond the call of duty to serve the needs 
of Congress. 
This Chamber will feel Ms. Mitchell’s ab-
sence. I join many past and present Members 
of Congress in my gratitude and appreciation 
to Ms. Mitchell for her outstanding leadership 
and unwavering support. This nation is grate-
ful for her commitment and the personal sac-
rifices she has made during her time in the 
Army Legislative Liaison Office. 
On behalf of the United States House of 
Representatives and the United States of 
America, I commend Ms. Jodi Mitchell for her 
tireless dedication in support of our Army, our 
Soldiers and this Nation. I congratulate her on 
an extremely successful career, dedicated to 
service, and wish her the best in all her future 
endeavors.

HONORING THOSE WHO FOUGHT 
THE HONDA CANYON FIRE 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I want to 
honor those who served diligently to combat 
the Honda Canyon Fire that occurred on Van-
denberg Space Force Base, California on De-
cember 20, 1977 on its 44th Anniversary. 
The Base, which at the time was known as 
Vandenberg Air Force Base, had strategic, 
scientific, and military significance to our mili-
tary readiness and national security as the 
Western Space and Missile Center. 
In persistently safeguarding the Base, four 
individuals lost their lives. These heroes in-
clude the Base Commander Col. Joseph G. 
Turner, the Base Fire Chief Billy J. Bell, the 
Base Assistant Fire Chief Eugene Cooper, 
and a heavy equipment operator, Clarence 
McCauley. 
Furthermore, sixty-five active duty, govern-
ment, civilian, and contract workers were in-
jured when they were overrun by the Honda 
Canyon Fire. 
Despite these losses, active duty, govern-
ment, and contract workers—augmented with 
local civilian fire fighting forces—continued to 
battle the flames to prevent the loss of vital 
military equipment, launch facilities, commu-
nications sites, and satellite test facilities. 
These personnel encountered an additional 
seven fire overruns of their personnel and 
equipment. They rescued injured and burned 
personnel, then regrouped to modify their tac-
tics and strategies before heroically continuing 
to fight until the fire was subdued. 
Following this tragic fire, military com-
manders assessed their losses and their re-
sponse to the fire, prepared a comprehensive 
mishap report, convened a planning group, 
and prepared an Operation Plan to address 
the findings of the mishap report. They en-
hanced training, firefighting capabilities, and 
support roles for all base operations groups to 
help manage similar events in the future. 
Unfortunately, the efforts of all those who 
fought the Honda Canyon Fire—whether ac-
tive duty or civilian—have never been recog-
nized. 
I want to acknowledge the loyalty, integrity, 
and resourcefulness of the active duty, gov-
ernment civilian, and contract workers who as-
sisted in fighting this fire. I ask all members of 
the House of Representatives to recognize 
them for service to their country and specifi-
cally for their efforts to quell the historic Honda 
Canyon Fire and protect critical infrastructure 
at the Base, which is located in the Califor-
nia’s 24th Congressional District and is an 
asset to the community and integral to our na-
tional security.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I

After the Washington Post donated WTOP 
to Howard University, the rebranded WHUR 
debuted on December 10, 1971, with the mis-
sion of ‘‘Delivering Excellence In Broadcasting 
and Community Service.’’ 
In January 2004, WHUR was the first radio 
station in the District of Columbia metropolitan 
area to convert to digital broadcasting. In Sep-
tember 2016, the station was named ‘‘Urban 
Station of the Year’’ by the National Associa-
tion of Broadcasters. 
Today, WHUR broadcasts to nearly half a 
million listeners across five states and the Dis-
trict and is one of the few commercial radio 
stations in the United States that is owned and 
operated by an institution of higher education. 
I ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in recognizing WHUR for 50 years of pro-
viding culturally enriching content to the Dis-
trict of Columbia and the surrounding commu-
nities. I wish WHUR many more years of suc-
cess.

HONORING LT. COL. ANTHONY 
WILLIAMS 
HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to acknowledge the exemplary service of 
Lieutenant Colonel Anthony William’s as a De-
partment of Defense legislative fellow. LTC 
Williams is transitioning from his current as-
signment in my office to serve as an Army 
Legislative Liaison for Intelligence in the Office 
of the Chief Legislative Liaison, Programs Di-
vision. 
Born in Seoul, Republic of Korea, LTC Wil-
liams was commissioned as a Military Intel-
ligence Officer from Louisiana State University 
in 2004. He earned his Bachelor of Science in 
Biological Engineering from Louisiana State 
University, his Master of Arts in Defense and 
Strategic Studies from the Naval War College 
in Rhode Island and is currently attaining his 
Master of Professional Studies in Legislative 
Affairs at George Washington University. 
LTC Williams served in a broad range of as-
signments within the U.S. Army Special Oper-
ations Command, mostly with the 75th Ranger 
Regiment. He served seven total combat de-
ployments in Iraq, Turkey-and Afghanistan. He 
most recently served as the Senior Intel-
ligence Officer for the Combined Joint Special 
Operations Task Force Syria in Turkey, assist-
ing partnered forces and conducting counter-
terrorist missions. 
While too numerous to mention in their en-
tirety, LTC Williarnss military decorations in-
clude the Bronze Star Medal with two Oak 
Leaf Clusters, the Meritorious Service Medal 
with two Oak Leaf Clusters and the Army 
Commendation Medal with three Oak Leaf 
Clusters. 
I have had the privilege of working directly 
with LTC Williams as a fellow in my Capitol 
Hill office over the last year, LTC Williams’ 
professionalism, performance and commitment 
to his work in my office were in keeping with 
the highest traditions of military service and 
made a lasting impression on both myself and 
his Capitol Hill coworkers. We will all miss him 
tremendously. 
I have also had the pleasure of meeting 
LTC Williamss family, who shares his selfless 
commitment to our country. I thank his wife, 
Tanya, as well as his two children, Liam and 
Leona, for their sacrifices made in supporting 
his service. 
Madam Speaker, throughout his career, 
LTC Williams has positively impacted soidiers, 
peers and his superiors. He is a model Army 
Officer and our country has benefited from his 
extraordinary leadership and passion for our 
Armed Forces. It is with great appreciation 
that I recognize and commend LTC Williams 
for his commitment to our country and wish 
him all the best as he continues his Army 
service.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
MAISHA FIELDS, JESSICA PRICE, 
ANDREA HERBERT, AND KELLY 
OSUNA 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize a group of volunteers led by Maisha 
Fields, Jessica Price, Andrea Herbert, and 
Kelly Osuna for their work providing equitable 
access to the lifesaving COVID–19 vaccine. 
The devastating effects of the COVID–19 
pandemic have been felt in every corner of 
our community. Unfortunately, underserved 
communities have borne the brunt of the pan-
demic—with racial and ethnic minority groups 
contracting and dying from COVID–19 at a 
much higher rate due to discriminatory 
healthcare practices, lack of healthcare ac-
cess, disproportionate representation in front- 
line occupations, and unfair and crowded 
housing conditions. 
As the COVID–19 vaccine finally began its 
rollout, many breathed a sigh of relief as a re-
turn to normalcy seemed within view. How-
ever, community leaders like Maisha, Jessica, 
Andrea, and Kelly—who had seen first-hand 
the effects of inequity in our pandemic re-
sponse—knew vaccine accessibility would not 
only 
face 
similar 
challenges 
reaching 
marginalized groups but would ultimately ham-
per our recovery and cost even more lives. 
These four incredible women jumped into 
action and created a system of equitable vac-
cine clinics that operated throughout under-
served communities in Arapahoe and Adams 
Counties. Their efforts included extensive col-
laboration with the Colorado Department of 
Public Health and Environment, finding and 
securing accessible venues, and recruiting vol-
unteers to work at the clinics as translators, 
organizers, and vaccine administrators. De-
spite working full-time, this group of women 
went on to hold over 150 equity vaccine clinics 
throughout our community—culminating in 
more than 50,000 people receiving life-saving 
vaccines. 
Time and time again, it is community lead-
ers like Maisha, Jessica, Andrea, Kelly, and 
their devoted group of volunteers who give me 
hope we can overcome any challenges that 
are thrown our way. I am honored to recog-
nize this group of volunteers led by these four 
women and I thank them for their work putting 
our community on a path towards a more eq-
uitable and safe place to call home.

HONORING 
THE 
200TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE LANCASTER PUB-
LIC LIBRARY 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Lancaster Public 
Library in the Town of Lancaster, New York on 
its bicentennial anniversary. 
The Lancaster Public Library was founded 
in 1821 as the ‘‘Cayuga Creek Veterans’ Li-
brary Society’’ in honor of the estimated forty 
veterans from the American Revolution and 
War of 1812 that founded the library. The li-
brary grew considerably over the years, mov-
ing from the Johnson School House to the 
Lancaster Presbyterian Church in 1832. It then 
moved to the Town Hall in 1896 and then to 
the Potter Estate in 1940 after the residence 
was donated by Mrs. Fanny Potter Eaton. In 
1947, the growing Village of Depew located 
within the Town of Lancaster opened its own 
branch library, enabling even more Western 
New Yorkers to read and learn. By 1964, the 
Depew branch had opened its own exclusive 
facility until the Lancaster and Depew libraries 
merged in 2005. 
Today, the Lancaster Public Library is one 
of the most vibrant and community-oriented li-
braries in the Buffalo and Erie County Public 
Library System. The library hosts various pro-
grams for all community members to enjoy. In 
recent years, the library has organized institu-
tional staples for children such as story hours, 
crafting, and science activities. For adults the 
library hosts lectures series from local leaders 
on business, STEM topics, government affairs, 
and the arts. Even during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the Lancaster Public Library worked to 
provide extensive virtual programming for the 
residents of Lancaster. Additionally, raffles, 
giveaways, and chicken barbeque fundraisers 
also help to promote the Lancaster Public Li-
brary’s close-knit relationship with our commu-
nity. 
The Lancaster Public Library also partners 
with other local organizations and agencies to 
enhance their patrons’ library experiences. 
Through the Lancaster Historical Society, the 
library has been able to compile photography 
displays of Lancaster from its humble begin-
nings to the bustling town that it is today. With 
Frosty’s Ice Cream, a Lancaster favorite, the 
library has organized scavenger hunts for chil-
dren with Frosty’s coupons as prizes. Finally, 
the Lancaster Public Library has worked 
closely with the Erie County Department of 
Health to keep community members knowl-
edgeable about COVID–19 and vaccinations. 
The library has forwarded public health direc-
tives and created public forums for citizens to 
speak directly with county health officials. 
I thank the Lancaster Public Library for its 
tireless efforts serving the community since its 
founding and I again congratulate the library 
on its bicentennial anniversary.

150TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to congratulate and commend the Na-
tional Association of Insurance Commissioners 
(NAIC) on the celebration of its 150th Anniver-
sary and for the many years of advocacy and 
responsible stewardship of the insurance in-
dustry. Since its founding in 1871, NAIC has 
worked to diligently regulate the national insur-
ance industry and market and protect hun-
dreds of millions of American consumers. 
As the first elected State Insurance Com-
missioner of California and former member of 
the NAIC. I know how invaluable state regu-
lators’ frontline role can be in holding insur-
ance companies accountable. I am proud to 
continue to work closely with the NAIC here in 
Congress. including through the introduction of 
my bill the Primary Regulators of Insurance 
Vote Act. This important piece of legislation 
would support the work of the NAIC by ensur-
ing that the expertise of our nation’s primary 
insurance regulators, state commissioners, 
has equal weight in the monitoring of our fi-
nancial stability at the national level. 
Were it not for the work of the NAIC and its 
members. Americans would all too often be 
left unprotected from predatory practices of in-
surance companies. On behalf of the people 
of California’s 3rd Congressional District. 
please accept my sincere congratulations and 
gratitude for the work you have done and con-
tinue to do and my best wishes for the years 
ahead.

CELEBRATING 30 YEARS OF 
KAZAKHSTAN’S INDEPENDENCE 
HON. STEVE CHABOT 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, as co-chair 
of the U.S.-Kazakhstan Congressional Cau-
cus, I rise today to celebrate 30 years of 
Kazakhstan’s independence and three dec-
ades of the U.S.-Kazakhstan bilateral relation-
ship. In 1991, the United States was the first 
country to recognize Kazakhstan’s independ-
ence, and the relationship remains as impor-
tant today as it was 30 years ago. 
In 2010, the United States and Kazakhstan 
entered into a Strategic Partnership and 
launched the Annual Bilateral Consultations on 
a variety of issues including but not limited to 
regional cooperation and security, rule of law 
and economic development, and human rights 
and civil society. In 2018, the two countries 
elevated their cooperation to establish an En-
hanced Strategic Partnership for the 21st Cen-
tury, and agreed to heightened cooperation on 
a multitude of policy issues. 
One of the strongest areas of cooperation 
between the United States and Kazakhstan 
has been in the economic arena. Since inde-
pendence, U.S. companies have been a sig-
nificant source of foreign direct investment for 
Kazakhstan, and over the past 30 years, U.S. 
investment in Kazakhstan has totaled an esti-
mated $370 billion. Kazakhstan has worked 
hard to create a strong market economy, and 
the country has focused significant resources 
on rule of law issues to create a welcoming 
environment for all foreign investment. 
Kazakhstan became a member of the World 
Bank’s International Center for Settlement of 
Investment Disputes (‘‘ICSID’’) in 1992, a 
member of the World Trade Association 
(WTO) in 2015, and in 2017, Kazakhstan be-
came a member of the Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
In 2018, the government officially launched the 
Astana International Finance Center (AIFC), 
which among other things, provides foreign in-
vestors with the opportunity to seek out an al-
ternative jurisdiction for dispute resolution. 
Such investments in the rule of law in 
Kazakhstan have been an important step to 
grow Kazakhstan’s market economy and con-
tinue to attract investment from the United 
States. 
As we continue to grow our strong eco-
nomic ties, I urge Congress to establish Per-
manent 
Normal 
Trade 
Relations 
for 
Kazakhstan as soon as possible. I was hon-
ored to recently join in the bipartisan effort to 
introduce H.R. 5544, which lifts Kazakhstan 
from the existing constraints of the outdated 
Jackson-Yanik Amendment. This graduation 
for Kazakhstan is long overdue. As Ranking 
Member of the House Foreign Affairs Sub-
committee which has jurisdiction over U.S. for-
eign policy issues affecting Central Asia, I un-
derstand what an important regional partner 
Kazakhstan has been to the United States 
during the past 30 years. But I also under-
stand what an important role Kazakhstan will 
continue to play in the region moving forward, 
and any efforts to strengthen our economic 
ties will strengthen the bilateral relationship 
across the board. 
So I would like to congratulate all the people 
of Kazakhstan as well as Kazakh-Americans 
taking part in the 30th anniversary celebra-
tions this month.

HONORING RANDOLPH BRINKLEY 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I offer 
these remarks on behalf of Congressman Ben 
Cline and myself in honor of Randolph 
‘‘Randy’’ W. Brinkley of Daleville, Virginia, who 
passed away on November 13, 2021, at the 
age of 51. Mr. Brinkley served the community 
as a long-time educator and scoutmaster. 
Mr. Brinkley was born on January 12, 1970 
in Covington, Virginia, to Robert Franklin 
Brinkley and Glenda Scott Brinkley. Following 
his graduation from Alleghany High School in 
1988, he joined and served in the U.S. Army 
National Guard for the next eight years. 
He received degrees from numerous univer-
sities including a Masters of Arts in Teaching 
from Mary Baldwin and a Post-Masters degree 
as an Education Specialist from the University 
of Virginia. He began his teaching career in 
Roanoke city. Over the years he taught at 
several schools throughout the state and 
helped them establish programs to foster 
STEM education for their students. For the 
last five years, Mr. Brinkley has been serving 
as the STEM instructor for Salem High 
School. 
Outside of the classroom, Mr. Brinkley spent 
much of his time serving as a scoutmaster 
with the Boy Scouts of America. He was an 
Assistant Scout Master and High Adventure 
Coordinator for Troop 211, which met at St. 
Mark’s United Methodist Church. He was also 
a Mason at a local lodge and a Shriner who 
advocated for the Shriner’s Hospital for Chil-
dren. He spent his life teaching and investing 
in the lives of youth in the community. His dis-
tinguished service and kindness will be greatly 
missed by all who knew him. 
Mr. Brinkley’s survivors include his wife of 
twenty-five years, Donna Lynn Brinkley; his 
son, Nathaniel Scott Brinkley; and many other 
beloved family and friends. We offer them my 
condolences on the loss of this great man and 
educator.

CONGRATULATING GARY COHEN 
ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to congratulate Gary Cohen of Oakland, 
California, on occasion of his retirement from 
Blue Shield of California following a distin-
guished career as an attorney, public servant, 
advocate, mentor and leader committed to im-
proving the health and well-being of millions of 
Americans. 
Gary served the House honorably as my 
Chief of Staff in 2010 before helping lead the 
Obama Administration’s implementation of the 
Affordable Care Act as the Director of the 
Center for Consumer Information and Insur-
ance Oversight (CCIIO) where he oversaw im-
plementation of regulations that established 
critical consumer protections that directly im-
pacted the lives of millions of Americans. 
As General Counsel to Covered California, 
California’s health benefit marketplace—and 
Deputy Commissioner General Counsel during 
my tenure as California’s Insurance Commis-
sioner—Gary served as a passionate voice for 
consumers and worked tirelessly to improve 
Californians’ access to affordable and com-
prehensive insurance coverage. As General 
Counsel for California’s Public Utilities Com-
mission, Gary developed a legal strategy that 
put consumers first amidst the state’s unprec-
edented energy crisis. 
In private practice, and following his govern-
ment service, Gary pushed major California 
companies, including Blue Shield, to act in-
stead of stand on the sidelines on making 
health coverage more affordable for members, 
empowering patients with better access to 
health data, and addressing the Bay Area’s 
homelessness crisis. 
Gary’s experiences as a patient led him to 
push for a delivery system that is simplified, 
affordable and more patient friendly. He 
served as a trusted, experienced advisor to 
the California delegation on health care 
issues, and I have no doubt he will continue 
to do so following his retirement on the issues 
that matter. 
In government and the private sector, Gary 
led with compassion and empathy. Gary in-
spired his staff to be passionate, fearless and 
to act consistent with their values in standing 
for what is right, no matter how challenging 
the politics or environment. 
Gary is also a loving husband to his lifetime 
love Liz, and an attentive father and grand-
father. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in extending our appreciation and 
best wishes to Gary and his family following 
an outstanding and meaningful career.

HONORING YOLETTE BONNET 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Yolette 
Bonnet, a fierce advocate for health care in 
Florida’s 21st Congressional District who re-
cently announced her retirement. For 20 
years, Yolette has been committed to improv-
ing access to quality health care for individuals 
and families across South Florida. She has 
gone above and beyond to meet their health 
care and social service needs, regardless of 
their ability to pay. 
Under Yolette’s leadership, what began as a 
small social service organization in 1985— 
then known as The Comprehensive AIDS Pro-
gram—has since been transformed into a 
community health center that provides com-
prehensive and culturally competent care to all 
people. Known today as FoundCare, this orga-
nization plays a vital role in the Palm Beach 
County community. 
Yolette has worked to garner millions of dol-
lars in grants and donations for FoundCare, 
helping the organization to expand to a total of 
seven locations across the county. Yolette 
was 
instrumental 
in 
helping 
designate 
FoundCare as Florida’s first Federally Quali-
fied Health Center (FQHC), which receives 
federal funding to serve low-income members 
of our community. Today, FoundCare is the 
largest non-governmental FQHC in Palm 
Beach County. Yolette has also supported our 
community throughout the COVID–19 public 
health crisis, initiating Florida’s first COVID–19 
community testing site at FoundCare. 
Yolette’s dedication and service to the peo-
ple of South Florida is truly inspiring. Her out-
standing work has touched countless lives, 
and I am so thankful for her efforts to improve 
health equity within our community. I wish her 
well on her retirement and I am proud to 
honor her today.

HONORING THE CAREER OF MR. 
CAMERON COLLIER 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. Cameron Collier of Decatur, Indiana 
for his dedicated service to our Nation as an 
officer in the United States Navy. Cameron 
has just retired from the Navy, and I wish to 
reflect the gratitude I, and all northeast Indi-
ana, have for him. 
Having graduated from the United States 
Naval Academy in 2001, Cameron reported to 
Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, 
Virginia, in 2003, where he underwent training 
in preparation for deployment in support of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. During Iraqi Free-
dom, Cameron served as a Radar Intercept 
Officer aboard the aircraft carrier USS Harry 
Truman. 
In 2006, Cameron moved to Annapolis, 
Maryland with his family, where he served as 
the Training Officer on staff at the Naval Acad-
emy. He left active-duty service in 2010 to 
pursue a career in financial planning, yet re-
mained an officer in the Naval Reserve, attain-
ing the rank of Commander in 2016. In this 
capacity, he also served as Chairman of my 
Service Academy Board, responsible for inter-
viewing and evaluating high school students in 
Indiana’s Third District seeking a nomination 
to U.S. service academies. 
I hope Cameron’s heart is filled with joy 
knowing he has played an essential part in se-
curing our country’s greatest blessings. As he 
retires from the Navy and prepares to move 
on to the next chapter of his life, understand 
that his record of service will stand as a shin-
ing example to generations of Hoosiers con-
templating serving our country for years to 
come.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JIM 
LEYSER 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of my good friend, veteran, Jim 
Leyser, who passed away on November 17, 
2021. Jim was well known in the Central Val-
ley and was actively involved in the commu-
nity, volunteering his time for many causes. 
Jim was a father, husband, loyal friend, and 
veteran. 
Jim was born August 8, 1946 and was 
adopted in Hawaii to Maurice and Myrtle 
Leyser. Maurice, was a career navy sub-
mariner and was stationed on the submarine 
base of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. As Jim got 
older, Jim felt the need to join the United 
States Marine Corps. In 1968, he enlisted and 
got out in 1976. During that time, Jim was part 
of the Crash Fire and Rescue in the Phil-
ippines and Japan. In 1976, Jim got out of the 
Marine Corps as a sergeant. 
After serving in the Marine Corps, Jim met 
the love of his life, Mary. On April 24, 1981, 
they were married and started a family to-
gether. Jim worked at the Veteran Affairs Hos-
pital in the specimen lab. He was part of the 
Marine Corps League as well as Commandant 
for Detachment-14 and was in the American 
Legion Charlie Waters Post 4, previously in 
Post 147. Jim participated on the K9 awards 
board committee and was State President for 
the American Legion for 2013–2014. He also 
assisted the commander of the district 14 on 
American Legion Posts meetings, and so 
much more. 
Jim was often seen during Christmas volun-
teering for Toys-for-Tots; celebrating the Ma-
rine Corps Birthday at the ball every year and 
helping bartend for veteran events with the 
Marine Corps League. He made sure to be in-
cluded in awareness events like the Suicide 
Awareness Ride, the annual Spaghetti Dinner

gion Riders Chapter 509. He volunteered his 
time handing out blankets to veterans during 
the holidays and participated in many funeral 
ceremonies in the Honor Guard, specifically 
during the pandemic. Mary was always by his 
side at the events, with a smile on her face 
and chatting with veterans and their families. 
They were both friendly and helpful to every-
one and ready to assist when needed. 
Jim is survived by his wife of 40 years, 
Mary; his son; daughter-in-law, his son-in-law, 
12 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren. 
Jim’s wonderful daughter, Vickie, passed away 
in 2020. He leaves behind many friends in-
cluding his brothers and sisters of the Marine 
Corps. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in cele-
brating the life of Jim Leyser. I join his family 
and friends in the veteran community in cele-
brating his life and continuous service to oth-
ers.

HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, recently, 
I had the pleasure of attending Maria 
Procopio’s 100th birthday party. Maria has 
been a Vineland resident for 62 years. She 
was born in November of 1921 in the town of 
Montauro, Italy. In 1938, Maria married 
Giovanni Procopio and they immigrated to the 
United States in March of 1959. Maria and 
Giovanni have eight children, eleven grand-
children, and ten great grandchildren. On No-
vember 22, 2021, the Mayor of Vineland, An-
thony Fanucci, recognized and celebrated the 
100th birthday and longevity of Maria’s life. I 
hope that Maria had a great birthday and it 
was an honor to be able to attend her birthday

RECOGNITION OF THE COTULLA- 
LA SALLE COUNTY AIRPORT’S 
NEW AIRPORT TERMINAL GRAND

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the lead-
ership and community of La Salle County and 
the city of Cotulla on the grand opening of the 
new airport terminal, which is happening today 
in my district. I especially want to recognize

Mayor Jose Javier Garcia, Airport Manager 
E.T. Page, and members of the La Salle 
County Commissioners Court and Cotulla City 
Council for all the work that has gone into 
bringing today to fruition. 
The Airport has a rich history since its be-
ginning in 1947, when it was constructed to 
serve as an emergency airfield for military 
training aircraft in the area. The airport has 
truly become an area magnet for economic 
growth and in 2016, the Cotulla airport was 
even recognized as the TxDOT-Aviation Air-
port of the Year. 
With today’s ribbon cutting, Cotulla-La Salle 
County Airport (KCOT) has been set up for 
many years of success in the future. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in celebrating the air-
port’s success and thank them for all the work 
they do every day in south Texas.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
PAM MARPHIS 
HON. STEVE SCALISE 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the service of Pam Marphis, a 
selfless public servant and one of the longest- 
serving staffers in my office. 
Pam’s 22 years working in Congress began 
with then-Representative David Vitter in 1999, 
then with Bobby Jindal, and then with my of-
fice when I won a special election in 2008. 
Pam Marphis has helped thousands of con-
stituents with their casework over the course 
of her career and she has been a rock star in 
so many ways. 
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Pam 
tirelessly helped Louisiana families navigate 
the FEMA bureaucracy so that they could get 
the help they needed to rebuild their homes 
and communities that were devastated. 
When there was a child in Honduras need-
ing heart surgery, Pam worked with the State 
Department to get that child to a hospital in 
Louisiana. 
And as the world began to shut down in the 
beginning of this pandemic, Pam worked 
round-the-clock to get U.S. citizens back 
home. 
I thank Pam, for her faithful service to our 
country. Her decades of experience will be 
sorely missed. Jennifer and I wish Pam and 
Gary the best in this next chapter of their 
lives.

Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate my good 
friends and community leaders who have been 
serving my hometown of Shreveport for a re-
markable 75 years. 
The CPA firm—Heard, McElroy and Ves-
tal—has been an integral part of our commu-

has established itself as a ‘‘pillar of trust, in-
tegrity and competence.’’ Their firm is now 
one of the largest public accounting firms in 
Northwest Louisiana.

every day and have continued to be a corner-
stone for our region. We are blessed to have 
their mission of accounting excellence and 
commitment to integrity as a part of our com-

HONORING GARY MANN ON HIS 
80TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor an outstanding Hoosier, Gary 
Mann, as he celebrates his 80th birthday on 
December 13, 2021. Truly a giant in Elkhart, 
Indiana, Gary has demonstrated great leader-
ship, excellence, and service throughout this 
life. 
Gary, who graduated from Elkhart High 
School in the Class of 1959, was an excep-
tional student athlete. During his high school 
career, he earned two varsity letters each in 
football, baseball, and basketball. As a basket-
ball player, Gary helped the Blazers reach the 
IHSAA state finals and, as a senior, was part 
of the Elkhart High School team that reached 
the sectional championship. 
While he was a tremendous athlete across 
the board, Gary truly excelled on the football 
field. He rarely left the field during his football 
career, playing punter, tight end on offense, 
and safety on defense. Gary led the Blue 
Blazers in interceptions as a senior and was 
named MVP that year. 
Following his storied high school sports ca-
reer, Gary earned a full-ride scholarship to 
play football at Arizona State. Later, he earned 
a teaching degree from Ball State University 
and returned home to Elkhart County to teach 
and coach. 
In the classroom, Gary taught generations 
of students as a history teacher at West Side 
Middle School. Additionally, he served as a 
longtime coach across the county. His tenures 
spanned ten years as Elkhart Memorial High 
School varsity football assistant, twelve years 
as Elkhart Central High School varsity football 
assistant, two years as Elkhart High School 
varsity wrestling assistant, nine years as West 
Side Middle School freshman football coach, 
and five years as the West Side Middle 
School seventh grade football, wrestling, and 
track coach. 
For decades, Gary has been a respected 
mentor, coach, community leader, and role 
model to hundreds of young adults—both on 
and off the field. In recognition of his amazing 
legacy, Gary was inducted into the Elkhart 
County Sports Hall of Fame in 2012. 
At home and across Elkhart County, he is 
well known for his support, guidance, encour-
agement, and work ethic that has motivated 
his family and so many other Hoosiers. Gary 
and his wife, Ann, were married in 1962 and 
have been blessed with two children, five 
grandchildren, 
and 
three 
great-grand-
daughters. 
As Gary celebrates this incredible milestone, 
it is my privilege to honor him for his many ac-
complishments 
and—most 
importantly—his 
devoted service to the Hoosiers of Elkhart 
County. I wish Gary a happy birthday, and 
continued health and happiness in the years 
to come.

HONORING THE CAREER OF JEAN

HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the career of Jean M. Rousseau. Since 
2015, Jean served as the County Administra-
tive Office for the Fresno County Board of Su-
pervisors. 
Jean has been a citizen of the San Joaquin 
Valley his entire life. He has spent his mar-
riage and his time raising his three children in 
the Central Valley. Jean attended California 
State University, Fresno where he received his 
bachelor’s degree in Business Administration 
with an emphasis in accounting in 1986. Prior 
to attending college, he graduated from San 
Joaquin Memorial High School, my own alma 
mater. Jean has been with high school sweet-
heart, Andria for 38 years. 
Before working for Fresno County, Jean 
was County Administrative Officer for Tulare 
County, and he held various other accounting- 
related positions throughout the Valley. His ex-
perience as a Certified Public Accountant has 
been an essential asset to the Central Valley 
for more than 30 years. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the career of Jean M. Rous-
seau. His service and contributions to the 
Central Valley will be missed. I join his family, 
friends, and the community in celebrating 
Jean’s successful career and wish him the 
best of luck in retirement.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
250-YEAR 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE 
OF ALAMANCE 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, as we close 
out the calendar year, I rise today to com-
memorate the 250-year anniversary of the 
Battle of Alamance. 
In 1771, a group of North Carolinians took 
a stand for their rights, raising their voices in 
opposition to the unjust overreach and abuses 
they were subjected to under the watch of 
royal governor William Tryon. These colonists 
branded themselves as the Regulators—seek-
ing to protect individual liberties that had been 
encroached upon by a government more inter-
ested in serving itself than its people. Of pri-
mary concern to the Regulators were issues of 
unfair taxation, corruption, and illegally as-
sessed fines, penalties, and fees. 
Governor Tryon caught wind of the Regu-
lators’ revolt and moved swiftly to silence 
them. Assembling a militia at New Bern, Tryon 
and his forces headed west. The conflict 
reached its height when armed Regulators 
were met by the Governor’s militiamen in 
modern-day Alamance County. Refusing to be 
subdued, the Regulators defied Tryon’s call for 
their surrender and the Governor charged his 
militia to open fire. Many Regulators were 
killed, injured, or taken prisoner; but their 
cause was not forgotten and their bravery not 
wasted. 
Preceding the onset of the Revolutionary 
War, the Regulator Movement gave public 
face to the frustrations of colonists who recog-
nized they were toyed with like pawns at the 
hands of a power-hungry British Empire and 
its corrupt regime of abusive officials. Surely, 
it was the righteous anger, bold indignation, 
and strong resolve of these early North Caro-
linians that set flame to the hearts of their fel-
low American patriots who would declare their 
independence with resounding authority in 
1776, affirming: 
. . . That these United Colonies are, and of 
Right ought to be, FREE AND INDE-
PENDENT STATES; that they are absolved 
from all allegiance to the British Crown, and 
that all political Connection between them 
and the State of Great-Britain is and ought 
to be totally dissolved.’’ 
Madam Speaker, as we reflect on the Regu-
lators’ courage, may we in this Congress vow 
to preserve the fundamental rights to life and

TRIBUTE TO DR. ITALY ALBERT 
‘‘I.A.’’ GREENE 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to an educator, a veteran, 
and a fellow South Carolina State University 
alumnus as he celebrates his 100th birthday. 
Dr. Italy Albert ‘‘I.A.’’ Greene was born on the 
auspicious day of December 25, 1921 and has 
been blessed with longevity and a full life. 
I.A. Greene was born in Williamsburg Coun-
ty, South Carolina and graduated from Wilson 
High School in Florence, South Carolina in 
1941. After high school, he matriculated at 
South Carolina State College (now University), 
but World War II disrupted his plans. In 1942, 
he felt called to serve and enlisted in the U.S. 
Air Force. He received an honorable discharge 
in 1945 after three years of service. 
After leaving the Air Force, Dr. Greene re-
turned to South Carolina State and graduated 
in 1948 with a degree in agriculture. Upon 
graduation, he began teaching at Rosemary 
High School in Andrews, South Carolina, 
where he taught agriculture, biology, chem-
istry, and general science for five years. 
In 1953, Dr. Greene was hired as the Voca-
tional Agriculture Instructor at Mayo High 
School in Darlington, South Carolina, where 
he established the school’s first Agriculture 
Department. While teaching in Darlington, he 
continued his higher education earning a mas-
ter’s degree in education in 1957 at South 
Carolina State and completing an additional 
30 hours of post graduate work in Secondary 
Administrative Education. 
During the 1968–1969 school year, Dr. 
Greene became Mayo High School’s Assistant 
Principal. That year he oversaw the school’s 
Accreditation Committee for the Southern As-
sociation of Secondary Schools. After just one 
year as Assistant Principal, Dr. Green was 
elevated to serve as Mayo High School’s Prin-
cipal. 
His first year as Principal in 1969 through 
1970 was historic. That was the year the 
courts ordered schools in Darlington County to 
integrate. Dr. Greene referred to his experi-
ence as ‘‘baptism by fire.’’ He often recalls 
that no college classroom or textbook could 
prepare an educator to oversee such a signifi-
cant change. Yet, Dr. Greene says, ‘‘it was the 
most dramatic and exciting period of my ca-
reer.’’ 
Dr. Greene spent the rest of his career as 
Mayo High School’s Principal and retired in 
1983. In retirement, he has been active in the 
community; working with Habitat for Humanity, 
the Red Cross, United Way, the Community 
Action Agency, the Lord Cares Ministry, Fel-
lowship of Christian Athletes, St. John’s Herit-
age Foundation, and Billie Hardee Home for 
Boys. 
His faith is the foundation of his life. He and 
his wife co-founded Comfort Ministries to offer 
Christian counseling and Bible study for the 
community. They also own two mobile home 
parks in Darlington County to support families 
in need of housing. St. James the Elder Theo-
logical Seminary of the Holy Catholic Church 
International awarded him an honorary Doctor 
of Divinity degree in 2012. 
Dr. Greene is an active member of Bethel 
AME Church in Darlington, where he taught 
Bible study, Sunday school, and new member 
classes. He has also been a member of the 
Men’s Choir and served as a class leader and 
as steward pro-tem. Dr. Greene is married to 
the former Effie Bacote of Darlington, and they 
are the parents of two children, grandparents 
of six, and great-grandparents of six. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in wishing centenarian I.A. 
Greene a heartfelt happy birthday. He has led 
a remarkable life and has had a tremendous 
impact on the lives of countless students and 
many others in his community. I offer sincere 
congratulations to Dr. Greene on reaching this 
significant milestone and extend best wishes 
for many more happy and healthy days.

IN RECOGNITION OF HOSSAM 
MAKSOUD, PHARMD 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. 
Hossam Maksoud for his outstanding career 
and dedication to creating accessible health 
services. For over twenty-five years, Dr. 
Maksoud has been at the forefront of pro-
viding affordable medication and healthcare. 
When Dr. Maksoud received his pharma-
ceutical degree in 1990 from St. John’s Uni-
versity’s School of Pharmacy, he already had 
an established family business and chain of 
pharmacies in Egypt. Dr. Maksoud used this 
entrepreneurial 
experience 
in 
the 
United 
States to establish Maksoud Pharm, Inc in 
1993. 
Maksoud Pharm grew into a chain of inde-
pendent retail pharmacies in the New York tri-
state area. With the revenues generated from 
Maksoud Pharm, Dr. Maksoud was able to 
launch his long-term care pharmacy company, 
Community Care Rx. 
Dr. Maksoud currently serves as Chief Ex-
ecutive Officer of Community Care Rx. As a

long-term care pharmacy, the company serves 
Adult & Pediatric Residential Programs, As-
sisted Living Facilities, Hospital Discharge 
Programs, HIV Programs, Hospital and Nurs-
ing Home Discharges and Skilled Nursing Fa-
cilities. Community Care Rx has a specific 
focus on nonprofit organizations that serve in-
dividuals unable to care for themselves. 
Dr. Maksoud’s goal is to address pharma-
ceutical drug shortages, working with lists pro-
vided by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). Over the years, Dr. Maksoud created 
additional healthcare companies to confront 
shortage concerns, such as Community Care 
Specialty Pharmacy, which is URAC and 
ACHC accredited, to address the difficulty in 
obtaining specialty disease state medications 
for patients. Dr. Maksoud also created Com-
munity Care Consulting, which reviews pa-
tients’ medication charts in order to reduce pa-
tient and facility financial burdens. 
In 2017, Dr. Maksoud once again launched 
an initiative to address the drug shortage 
problem. With four partners, he created 
Dawah Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a drug manu-
facturing company. Dawah Pharmaceuticals 
aims to provide affordable medication to the 
market by producing generic versions of other-
wise widely inaccessible medication. One of 
these generics is currently under review by the 
FDA and has a projected release in the sec-
ond quarter of 2022. In partnership with 
Oakrum Pharma, Dawah Pharmaceuticals will 
market the medication through wholesale dis-
tribution across the United States, to the ben-
efit of institutions such as hospitals and clinics. 
Dr. Maksoud is a board member of the 
Egyptian African Business Association (EABA) 
and is an active participant in many long-term 
care and nonprofit associations in the tristate 
area, 
such 
as 
IAC, 
ESAAL, 
NYAEMP, 
NYSACRA, HCANJ, and NJACP. Additionally, 
Dr. Maksoud, along with his family, estab-
lished The Maksoud Foundation, which assists 
the elderly in obtaining medication they cannot 
afford. 
As a dual citizen of Egypt and the United 
States with extensive experience living and 
working in multiple countries, Dr. Maksoud 
brings a unique perspective to his work. His 
global experience has demonstrated to him 
the importance and the value of diversity and 
community philanthropy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Hossam Maksoud for 
his community service, his generosity, and es-
pecially his commitment to providing afford-
able medication and increasing access to 
quality healthcare.

BIRTHDAY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to wish United States Marine 
Corps Veteran and valuable member of our 
community, Mr. Lloyd B. Peck, a happy 90th 
birthday. 
Mr. Peck served as an active-duty Marine

erans. 
In recent years, Mr. Peck has organized 
Veterans Day parades and has served as the 
Chief Parade Marshal in Altoona, Pennsyl-
vania. Further, he heads the Blair County War

ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ BRIGGS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Briggs of 
Westminster, Colorado who passed away on 
December 2, 2021. 
Bob was born December 24, 1937 in Gree-
ley, Colo. as one of eight children and the old-
est son. His family moved to Westminster, 
Colo. in 1943, where Briggs graduated from 
Westminster High School. He earned a bach-
elor’s degree and a master’s degree from Col-
orado State University, both in horticulture. Ac-
cording to a January 2020 profile in Orchard 
Living, ‘‘he majored in horticulture because he 
did not want to wear a tie for a living.’’ Bob 
married his wife Shirley on September 8, 
1957. 
Bob had a long career in local and state 
politics, serving as Adams County Commis-
sioner for four years beginning in 1979, as the 
local Board Member for the Regional Trans-
portation District for four years beginning in 
1999, and a State Representative for District 
29 from January 2003 to 2005. He served two 
terms on the Westminster City Council from 
2007 to 2015, including a stint as the Mayor 
Pro Tem. He also served as charter President 
of the original Westminster Chamber of Com-
merce in 1967. That group merged with the 
Adams County Chamber in 1982 where he 
also served as a board member. In this free 
time, Bob spent his time serving the Colorado 
Greenhouse Grower’s Association, the West-
minster Open Space Board, the Westminster 
Rotary, the Jefferson County Historical Com-
mission and was still serving as a member of 
the Board of Directors for the Butterfly Pavilion 
upon his passing. He was a longtime pro-
ponent of local rail and helped found the advo-
cacy group, Rocky Mountain Rail. 
Bob was a devoted husband and loving fa-
ther and grandfather. Bob and Shirley raised 
two children and enjoyed spending time with 
their grandchildren. I am deeply grateful for his 
lifetime of service to our community. 
CELEBRATING GREENVILLE COUN-
TY SCHOOLS 2021 HALL OF FAME 
INDUCTEE, MR. BILL EVANS 
HON. JEFF DUNCAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate Mr. Bill Evans in being named a 
Greenville County Schools 2021 Hall of Fame 
Inductee. 
Born and raised in Washington, Georgia, 
Mr. Evans was inspired by his own high 
school teachers. He attended Berry College in 
Rome, Georgia, and graduated with a bach-
elor’s degree in Physical Education and a 
minor in English. Upon graduation, Mr. Evans 
began his teaching career in 1989. 
Evans taught English at Hillcrest High 
School in Greenville, South Carolina for 28 
years. He is responsible for developing the 
school’s Speech and Debate Program, which 
has won numerous tournaments and competi-
tions. Altogether, his work in the education 
field promoted excellence for South Carolina 
students in the subjects of English, Speech, 
and Debate for nearly three decades. 
During his career, Mr. Evans was twice 
named Teacher of the Year. In 2012, he 
earned the National Speech and Debate 
Teacher of the Year award and was inducted 
into the Mississippi Speech and Debate Hall of 
Fame. Additional accolades for Mr. Evans in-
clude the National Speech and Debate Four 
Diamond Coach Award and a two-time presi-
dency of the South Carolina Speech Teachers 
Association. 
In 2017, Mr. Evans retired from Hillcrest 
High School. That year’s edition of the school 
yearbook was dedicated to him. The following 
year, the annual Hillcrest Speech and Debate 
Tournament was named in his honor. 
Fellow teachers remember Mr. Evans as 
someone who takes new teachers under his 
wing and shows them how to make the class-
room a positive and fun environment. They re-
call his love of Shakespeare and how his 
interactive lessons allowed students to engage 
and enjoy Shakespeare just as much. Mr. 
Evans describes himself as someone who was 
‘‘destined to be an educator.’’ Among his 
many distinguished students are an award- 
winning poet, an award-winning screenplay 
writer, numerous state and national Speech 
and Debate champions, and several current 
and former members of my congressional 
staff. 
In late November, at the Greenville Conven-
tion Center, Greenville County Schools hon-
ored Evans at its annual Hall of Fame cere-
mony. Today, Mr. Evans and his wife, Maria, 
reside in Simpsonville, SC. They have three 
children. 
Reflecting on the accomplishments of Mr. 
Evans and his students, I am reminded of the 
impact Mr. Evans continues to make on young 
adults who completed their high school edu-
cation at Hillcrest High School. His students, 
fellow teachers, and surrounding community 
members in the state of South Carolina are in-
spired by him. I am proud to represent and 
serve constituents as impactful as those like 
Mr. Evans. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be able 
to serve the Third District of South Carolina 
and to celebrate those who make a difference 
through education.

EDUCATORS FOR AMERICA ACT 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, today, I am 
proudly 
introducing 
the 
bicameral 
EDU-
CATORS for America Act, along with my col-
leagues, Representatives AXNE, HAYES, and 
GALLEGO, and my partners Senators REED and 
CASEY. 
Education is perhaps the most precious gift 
we have, the sharing of information about our 
world as we currently understand it to the next 
generation. Being an outstanding educator re-
quires a generosity of spirit, a will of steel, and 
a heart full of empathy. 
I understand the value of education. As an 
educator for forty years, l had the opportunity 
to see bright young minds in my classrooms 
hard at work. I always hoped that some of 
these bright young minds would go on to be-
come educators themselves. 
Unfortunately, I saw that students aspiring 
to become educators were sometimes discour-
aged—by the student debt they would face, by 
the salaries they would earn, and by the lack 
of support they would confront. 
Educators are struggling, particularly as we 
continue to grapple with the pandemic. We 
cannot afford to neglect the educator pipeline 
any longer. We simply cannot wait for the next 
generation of educators to appear. We must 
act intentionally to urgently recruit educators 
into the classroom, and more importantly, re-
tain educators in the classroom. As such, edu-
cators should be given the opportunities and 
support they need. This bill does just that: it 
addresses educator preparation, support for 
educators, financial assistance, and mobiliza-
tion of states and local communities in improv-
ing the educator pipeline. 
I will close with this quotation from a titan in 
American history, W.E.B. Du Bois: ‘‘Of all the 
Civil Rights for which the world has struggled, 
and fought for 5,000 years, the right to learn 
is undoubtedly the most fundamental.’’

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
GRANT COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT 
JUDGE, 
THE 
HONORABLE 
GEORGE S. CURRY 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the service and leadership of Grant 
County Circuit Court Judge George S. Curry. 
I first came to know Judge Curry when I had 
the honor of trying a case before him as a 
young special prosecutor. His skill as a judge 
to be fair, impartial and his knowledge of the 
rules of evidence made that trial much easier 
for a young victim of sexual assault, and for 
everyone in the courtroom. 
George was a product of Southwest Wis-
consin. He was raised there, went to school 
there and served most of public life there. He 
was born in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, and grad-
uated from Darlington High School. He grad-
uated from Luther College, Decorah, Iowa with 
a B.S. in Economics in 1969. He received his 
law degree from the University of Wisconsin 
Law School in 1972. While attending law 
school George also served in the United 
States Army Reserve and was honorably dis-
charged in 1971. 
George began his career as an attorney in 
private practice in 1972 and in 1990, Governor 
Tommy Thompson appointed him to the Grant 
County Circuit Court Judgeship. Judge Curry 
presided over the Grant County Circuit Court 
for 19 years until 2009. He was proud of de-
veloping and implementing the Grant County 
Fresh Start Program, a class that aimed to 
educate offenders and curb underage drinking. 
George was selected by Wisconsin Supreme 
Court Justice Shirley Abrahamson to chair the 
Judicial Conduct Advisory Committee for six 
years and, in 2018, was elected a Fellow of 
the Wisconsin Law Foundation for his distin-
guished and outstanding service as a Circuit 
Court Judge. Following his time as a Judge, 
George opened his own law practice, Curry 
Law & Mediation, focusing primarily on per-
sonal injury law. George was highly regarded 
for his ethics, integrity, and fair-mindedness 
during his distinguished legal career. 
Judge Curry passed away on Saturday Dec. 
4, 2021 surrounded by his wife Linda and their 
extended family, and I am honored to recog-
nize the life and service of a man who served 
the citizens of Southwest Wisconsin with such 
dignity and integrity.

today to recognize David Moser on his retire-
ment from the United States Department of 
Labor Office of Workman’s Compensation Pro-
grams’ Division of Energy Employees Occupa-
tional Illness Compensation. 
For nearly twenty years, David served 
across a variety of positions at the Department

which time he was stationed at several Naval 
locations, including at the U.S. Naval Hospital 
in Portsmouth, Virginia from 1981 to 1982 fol-
lowed by a 6-month deployment on the USS 
America to Europe. From 1984 to 1986, he 
went to the U.S. Marine Base Camp Butler in 
Okinawa, Japan with the 3rd Marine Corps 
Battalion as a Corpsman for an Artillery Unit 
followed by stints at the U.S. Naval Hospital at 
Subic Clinic in Subic Bay, Philippines and the 
U.S. Marine Corps Air Base in Yuma, AZ, as 
a corpsman for a Hawks Missile Unit from 
1986 to 1990. He then moved to be a Medical 
Representative for the U.S. Marine Corps Of-
fice Selection Team in Denver, Colo. from 
1990 to 1994. 
After he left the U.S. Navy, David joined the 
Department of Veterans Affairs in Denver, 
working several different positions in the mail 
room, customer service and foreign medical 
program. David subsequently joined the U.S. 
DOL, Office of Worker’s Compensation, En-
ergy Employee’s Occupational Illness Com-
pensation Program (EEOICP) in the Denver

nity, the State of Colorado, and the United 
States of America.

HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the career of Chief Master Sergeant 
Bruce A. Fong who will retire from the United 
States Air Force on December 18, 2021, after 
more than 31 years of military service. 
Chief Fong is a native of Central New York

School. He also holds a Bachelor of Science 
Degree in Computer Information Systems from 
Columbia College of Missouri, where he grad-
uated Magna Cum Laude. 
Chief Fong entered the active-duty Air Force 
under the delayed enlistment program in De-
cember 1979 and attended basic military train-
ing in July 1980 at Lackland Air Force Base, 
Texas. Following Basic Military Training, he 
went on to technical training at Sheppard Air 
Force Base, Texas to become an Air Cargo 
Specialist. 
In September 1980 Chief Fong, then Airman 
Basic, was assigned to the 603rd Military Airlift 
Support Squadron, Kadena Air Base, Oki-
nawa, Japan. He worked in the ramp services 
section where he was responsible for the on/

craft such as the Boeing 747, the Lockheed 
Martin C–5 Galaxy, C–141A/B Starlifter, C– 
130 Hercules, the McDonnell Douglas C–9 
Nightingale, and the KC–1O Extender. Chief 
Fong became phase two qualified on the C– 
130 and C–141, which provided the ability to 
service the aircraft without the supervision of 
a loadmaster. During his time at Kadena Air 
Base, Chief Fong was involved many times in 
an extraordinarily successful joint service de-
ployment exercise ‘‘Team Spirit’’ supervising 
the loading operations of military aircraft, often 
working with untrained Air Force and Marine 
Corps load crews. 
After two and a half years in Okinawa, Chief 
Fong had a permanent change of station to 
Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, where he 
was assigned to the 436th Aerial Port Squad-
ron. He worked in the special handling section 
and was responsible for the timely and accu-
rate inventory of critical cargo using the Aerial 
Port Documentation and Management System. 
Chief Fong also participated in the NATO ex-
ercise ‘‘Bright Star,’’ where he spent time in 
Cairo Egypt assisting the 436th Airlift Control 
Element in the on/off-loading of sixty aircraft 
and officially recognized for his effort by the 
Airlift Control Element commander. 
After a 10-year break in service Chief Fong 
joined the I 74th Fighter Wing, New York Air 
National Guard in February 1996 as a Drill 
Status Guardsmen. He was assigned to the 
174th Logistics Readiness Squadron as a

CHUCK GROSS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Chuck Gross of the Adams 
County Education Consortium on his retire-
ment. 
For more than six years, Chuck has served 
the Adams County Education community in his 
role as Executive Director. Chuck has worked 
in many different roles with several organiza-
tions over the years. One of his earliest roles 
was as Sr. Vice President and General Man-
ager of Kinzley-Hughes from 1988 to 1995. He 
then moved to Broadband and Associates 
from 1995 to 1996 and transitioned to the con-
sulting world as a Principal at Worden Gross 
Consulting for eleven years where he provided 
public relations, community relations, mar-
keting and communications to senior execu-
tives at some of America’s most well-known 
brands, including the Ritz-Carlton and the Met-
ropolitan Museum of Art. Following Worden 
Gross, Chuck went to work for Sector Brands 
for seven years working as a senior branding 
and marketing communications consultant, 
working collaboratively with each client’s exec-
utive leadership team to enhance its value and 
position the organization for leadership and 
growth. 
His final role has been with the Adams 
County Education Consortium where he has 
been responsible for directing a county-wide 
partnership—including school districts, higher 
education institutions, local governments and 
businesses—that works to enhance academic 
skills development, career exploration, and rel-
evant work-ready skills for all students in 
Adams County. My office has worked with 
Chuck on several different occasions over the 
years and I am inspired by his work ethic and 
contributions to Adams County Education 
community. 
I wish Chuck all the best in retirement and 
send gratitude for his service to our commu-
nity, the State of Colorado, and the United 
States of America. 
HONORING CITY COUNCIL MEMBER 
ELLA MAE SMALL FOR A LIFE-
TIME OF COMMUNITY AND PUB-
LIC SERVICE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor City Council Member Ella Mae Small 
for a lifetime of service to her community and 
local government in Cabarrus County, North 
Carolina. 
Upon graduation from the University of 
North Carolina at Charlotte, Councilwoman 
Small first worked as a schoolteacher in mul-
tiple districts throughout North Carolina and 
Georgia and served as a professor at North 
Carolina A&T University. After retiring from 
teaching, she assumed the high calling of pub-
lic service when she completed her husband 
Allen Small’s term on the Concord City Coun-
cil after he passed while holding office. As the 
first African American female member of the 
Council, Councilwoman Small paved the way 
for greater diversity in local representation and 
provided astute and knowledgeable leadership 
on the Council for over 15 years. 
Over the course of her career, Council-
woman Small has exhibited exceptional com-
mitment and dedication to improving her com-
munity. As a schoolteacher, she served as 
one of the first kindergarten teachers in North 
Carolina. Her influence as a trailblazer helped 
cement this position as a permanent fixture of 
primary education. Praised highly by her 
peers, Councilwoman Small exerted similar in-
fluence on the Concord City Council to serve 
as a catalyst for positive change. For example, 
this past year she helped take charge of cre-
ating the Concord United Committee for the 
purpose of further addressing issues associ-
ated with race, equity, and diversity in the 
City. Her exemplary leadership provides a 
standard for all public servants. Although well- 
known for her role and initiatives as Council-
woman, she has also remained firmly com-
mitted to carrying out her responsibilities as a 
concerned citizen by holding many positions 
with national and local organizations such as 
the National Education Association and the 
Cabarrus Community Council among many 
others. 
I would like to extend my most heartfelt ap-
preciation to Councilwoman Small for her 
years of exemplary service as a teacher, com-
munity leader, and public servant. I speak for 
our entire community in wishing her and her 
family continued success and happiness as 
she moves into retirement. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Councilwoman Ella Mae Small for 
her extraordinary service.

his 
retirement 
after 
36 
years 
as 
a 
Groundskeeper at Pekin Community High 
School. 
Jeff started working at Pekin Community 
High School as a Groundskeeper in 1985 after 
graduating in 1977. His professionalism, atten-
tion to detail, and strong work ethic will make 
him difficult to replace. Jeff noticed when he 
first started work at the high school that the 
field was brown in the middle. It took two and 
a half years, but he was able to grow the field 
to be green and presentable for the students 
who use it. Jeff is respected because of his 
dedication to his profession and to the school, 
and is well-liked by everyone there. I com-
mend Jeff for his hard work over the years to 
make Pekin Community High School a beau-
tiful place where students are able to learn. 
It is because of community leaders like Jeff 
Downer that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Jeff Downer on his retirement from 
Groundskeeping at Pekin Community High 
School.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LEE COOK 
HON. TOM O’HALLERAN 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and the legacy of Lee 
Cook, who passed away recently at the age of 
83. 
After being drafted into the U.S. Army dur-
ing the Korean War, Mr. Cook served our 
country with honor and distinction until he was

devotion, Lee has left a lasting impact on his 
community. 
He is survived by his wife of 65 years, eight 
children, twenty-two grandchildren, thirty-five 
great-grandchildren, and three great-great- 
great paternal grandchildren. 
On behalf of my wife and myself, I want to

and offer sincere condolences to his wife, Ella 
R. Cook, and children, Alta James, Tommy 
Nodestine, Nancy Brown, Christine Cook, Syl-
via Sloan, Sandy Cook, Martina Cook John-

My thoughts are with all who knew and 
loved Lee as they mourn his passing.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MARVIN 
SIMON 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to 
honor the life of Marvin Simon, a distinguished 
World War II veteran, fierce seniors’ and vet-
erans’ advocate, and most importantly, my 
friend for nearly 15 years. 
Marvin served in the U.S. Army Air Forces 
during the second World War. That service led 
to a lifetime of supporting the needs of our na-
tion’s veterans. 
Marvin and his wife Pearl moved to Florida 
in 1985 and he became a strong advocate for 
Broward County’s senior population. He was 
Vice Chair of the Area Agency on Aging’s Ad-
visory Council. As a member of the Pine Is-
land Ridge Civic Association, Marvin was re-
sponsible for the county’s emergency medical 
services having a base on the Pine Island 
Ridge condominium grounds. 
Marvin was also a longtime member of the 
Broward 
County 
Veterans 
Coalition. 
He 
worked tirelessly to ensure the men and 
women who served our nation maintained 
their dignity and wellbeing. 
Marvin served on my Academy Nominations 
Board from 2007 to 2014. In that role, he 
helped shape the future of the military by se-
lecting students who will lead the armed 
forces in the years ahead. 
Marvin and Pearl were married for 73 years 
before her death in 2020. They had two chil-
dren, five grandchildren, and eight great 
grandchildren. 
Although Marvin is no longer with us, his 
legacy lives on through the countless individ-
uals whose lives he changed for the better. 
Marvin Simon was one of a kind—a selfless, 
compassionate and a tireless advocate for 
others in Broward County. He was a patriot in 
the truest sense, will be profoundly missed but 
never forgotten.

CONGRATULATING DR. DUANE 
ESAREY ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 9, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Dr. Duane Esarey, who is retir-
ing from the Dickson Mounds Illinois State Mu-
seum in Lewistown after many years of tire-
less service. 
Dr. Esarey has been committed to the dis-
ciplines of archaeology and anthropology 
throughout his life, especially in Central Illi-
nois. He started his career in 1977, working in 
the field as an archaeologist in the Archae-
ological Research Labs at Western Illinois Uni-
versity. In 1982, Dr. Esarey earned a pro-
motion to Director of the Archaeological Field 
School of the University. The following year, 
he relocated to Lewistown and accepted a po-
sition as Collections Manager for the Dickson 
Mounds Illinois State Museum. Dr. Esarey 
served as Collections Manager until 1994, 
when he became Assistant Curator of Anthro-
pology for the Museum. He worked in this ca-
pacity until 2004 when he left to complete his 
Ph.D. at the University of North Carolina- 
Chapel Hill and work as Assistant Director for 
the Illinois State Archaeological Survey in 
Champaign-Urbana. After 15 years, the Mu-
seum welcomed him back on March 10, 2019 
as Director. Dr. Esarey’s contributions have 
been significant and irreplaceable to the profile 
and growth of Dickson Mounds Illinois State 
Museum, and the fields of archaeology and 
anthropology in Central Illinois. 
It is because of dedicated, innovative, and 
insightful leaders such as Dr. Esarey that I am 
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to, again, formally recognize Dr. Duane 
Esarey and thank him for his service to the 
collective Central Illinois community.
