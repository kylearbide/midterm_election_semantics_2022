CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JANE 
MORRISON 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and leadership of legendary pro-
gressive organizer Jane Morrison: an historic 
and trailblazing force for progress in America, 
beloved by all who were blessed to know her, 
particularly in our home city of San Francisco. 
Jane and her late husband, former San 
Francisco Supervisor Jack Morrison, lived their 
lives at the crossroads of some of the most 
pivotal moments in our nation’s history. Jane 
helped elect some of our most trans-
formational leaders, from President John F. 
Kennedy to California Governor Jerry Brown. 
In 2012, I had the great honor to appoint 
Jane, who was born before women had won 
the right to vote, to cast our district’s vote in 
the Electoral College for President Barack 
Obama: a true measure of our progress as a 
nation. 
Forged in Depression-era Oklahoma, Jane 
was known by all for her optimism, persever-
ance and courage. She began her career as 
a reporter during the Second World War, at a 
time when women were rarely in the news-
room, and later joined KNBR, where she 
would work for more than 30 years to bring 
more women into broadcasting. The same 
spirit of justice, progress and commitment to 
the truth propelled her to enter political activ-
ism and action. 
Over five decades, Jane was a godmother 
of progressive causes in San Francisco. She 
was a grassroots champion who brought un-
wavering grace and good humor, boundless 
energy and extraordinary persistence to her 
life’s mission to make our City and Country 
more just, equal and fair. Her home was a 
gathering place and a launching pad, where 
she masterfully wove together progressive 
coalitions for change in our city and country. 
She was a volunteer in the truest sense: dedi-
cating every degree of her time, energy and 
passion to achieving social justice, from em-
powering women to combating homelessness 
to championing the environment and the eco-
nomic prosperity of all San Franciscans. 
Jane advanced progress both from behind 
the scenes and from the center of the political 
arena. As she helped elect progressive lead-
ers, she served in her own right, including as 
Delegate to the Democratic National Conven-
tion in 1960 and 1964, Women’s Chair of the 
California Democratic Party in 1960, president 
of the San Francisco Human Rights Commis-
sion, president of the San Francisco Demo-
cratic Women’s Forum, Chair of the San Fran-
cisco Democratic County Central Committee, 
longtime president of San Francisco Tomorrow 
and on the Chinese Newcomers Service Cen-
ter. Her greatness was recognized in her 
many awards, including the California State 
Assembly’s ‘‘Woman of the Year,’’ which she 
received several times. 
Jane was a mentor and friend to so many. 
Personally, I learned so much from her. May 
her lifetime of courageous leadership be a 
source of inspiration to all. And may it be a 
comfort to Gimmy Park Li and all Jane’s loved 
ones that so many mourn their loss and are 
praying for them at this sad time.

REMEMBERING OFFICER JASON 
JUDD 
HON. DEBBIE LESKO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
with great sadness over the passing of Peoria 
Police Officer Jason Judd who was killed in 
the line of duty on July 1, 2020. 
He was beloved by many and was a loving 
husband to Teresa, and father to Terrence 
and Connor. 
He was a veteran and served eleven years 
and nine months in the United States Air 
Force before joining the Peoria Police Depart-
ment in July of 1999. 
He was a 21-year veteran with the Peoria 
Police Department and put his life on the line 
every day to keep Arizonans safe. He was a 
well-respected leader and hero to many. 
Officer Judd received numerous commenda-
tions for his excellent investigative police work, 
contributing to the arrests and convictions for 
crimes such as burglary, carjacking, DUI acci-
dents, fraud, stabbing, and second-degree 
murder. 
He also received the Lifesaving Medal and 
over 50 commendations from citizens, fellow 
officers, other agencies, and community lead-
ers. 
Throughout his career, he was involved in 
the annual Peoria Bike Rodeo, Youth Citizen’s 
Police Academy, multi-agency DUI enforce-
ment campaigns, school safety presentations, 
and the 4th of July celebrations at Lake Pleas-
ant, just to name a few. 
We are eternally grateful for his service to 
our state and nation. On this day, we, as a 
community, honor him and ask those who 
knew him to pray for his family during this time 
of mourning.

HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS

Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to offer my support for a new and 
exciting technology called hyperloop, a mod-
ern innovation to enhance our Nation’s trans-
portation infrastructure. Hyperloop consists of 
a network of sealed tubes where trains car-
rying cargo or passengers can pass through 
without air resistance or friction. This could 
drastically reduce travel time from hours to 
mere minutes. Benefits of this technology are 
numerous: in addition to shortening travel 
time, hyperloop is energy efficient and has the 
potential to dramatically cut greenhouse gas-
ses from our atmosphere. Additionally, while 
we enter a time of economic uncertainty, 
hyperloop represents an entirely new sector of 
the economy and would provide opportunities 
for new jobs and could stimulate commerce. 
Madam Speaker, I am especially excited 
about this new technology because of its 
unique tie to Kansas and the Third District. 
One of our finest constituent companies in 
Kansas’ Third District, Black and Veatch, has 
been working on hyperloop projects for some 
time, demonstrating that Kansas City would be 
a welcome location for any pilot program. Spir-
it AeroSystems, our neighbors in Wichita, 
have been tapped to help build the high-tech 
capsules for Virgin Hyperloop One, which has 
a project site in Kansas City, Missouri that 
could serve as the starting point for an even-
tual Kansas City-to-St.Louis stretch, cutting 
travel times from a nearly 4 hour drive to just 
30 minutes by hyperloop. And Kansas City 
has long been heralded as a talent center for 
high-tech and engineering jobs, which aligns 
well with the growth of this cutting-edge tech-
nology sector. Last October, I hosted a Small 
Business Committee field hearing in my dis-
trict, bringing together various startups and en-
trepreneurs to discuss innovation and expand-
ing capital for high-tech small businesses. In 
that same vein, I would be excited to see 
hyperloop introduced in the greater Kansas 
City metro area and look forward to showing 
what Kansas’ Third District has to offer.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Ms. Catalina Horak for her devoted 
service to our community as she prepares to 
enter the next chapter of her life at the end of 
this month. 
Ms. Horak cofounded and led Building One 
Community, a nonprofit organization in Stam-
ford, Connecticut. Since its establishment in 
2011, Building One Community has served 
more than 10,000 immigrants from over 100 
countries with language, vocational, legal and 
many other kinds of support. 
The Fourth Congressional District is home 
to a remarkably diverse range of people. We 
take pride in embodying key values such as 
openness, tolerance and altruism. Thanks in 
large part to Ms. Horak’s tireless efforts, Build-
ing One Community has helped thousands of 
immigrants successfully integrate into the 
broader community. I’m proud that the Fourth 
Congressional District, in partnership with or-
ganizations like Building One Community, con-
tinues to serve as an example of the important

country. 
For her 20 years of distinguished experi-
ence in the nonprofit sector, Ms. Horak was 
named an honoree for the 2017 Women of 
Distinction Awards by the YWCA of Darien 
and Norwalk. This year, she was appointed to 
the Board of Directors of Americares Free

along with a grateful Fourth Congressional 
District, in congratulating Ms. Catalina Horak 
for her extensive public service and in wishing 
her success in all her future endeavors.

HONORING THE LEFLORE COUNTY 
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
group of leaders, the Leflore County Board of 
Supervisors. 
On Monday, June 22, 2020 the Leflore 
County Board of Supervisors voted to remove 
the Confederate monument located on the 
Leflore County Courthouse lawn. This Confed-
erate monument has long been a divisive 
symbol for the citizens in the city of Green-
wood, MS and Leflore County. 
Unveiled on October 9, 1913 on the court-
house lawn, this monument has intimidated 
and invoked fear for over 100 years in citizens 
that have come to the courthouse to conduct 
county business. As a symbol of treason and 
slavery, this monument had no right to be in 
a public place. 
After legal advisement from Board Attorney 
Joyce Chiles, Supervisor Reginald Moore 
made a motion to have the Confederate 
monument removed from the courthouse lawn. 
The motion was seconded by Supervisor Eric 
Mitchell. 
Supervisors 
Robert 
Collins 
and 
Anjuan Brown joined in support and the mo-
tion was carried 4–0, with one member, Sam 
Abraham, absent from the meeting. This is a 
historic achievement for Leflore County as 
Mississippians move to create a more inclu-
sive climate throughout the state. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the Leflore County Board of 
Supervisors for their dedication and bravery to 
promote racial equality.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
MR.

FARMER’S 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
RAPPAHANNOCK 
ELECTRIC 
CO-
OPERATIVE 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Mr. Kent D. Farmer’s 
retirement as President and Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO) of Rappahannock Electric Coop-
erative. Mr. Farmer will retire on August 1, 
2020. 
Mr. Farmer has served as president and 
CEO of Rappahannock Electric Cooperative 
since 2004 and has been with REC for a total 
of 41 years. The Rappahannock Electric Co-
operative serves a wide range of Virginia, from 
the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Chesapeake 
Bay. Mr. Farmer is leaving a positive legacy 
with the Rappahannock Electric Cooperative 
that will not be forgotten. His strong leadership 
and genuine care and concern for local citi-
zens has contributed to many successes dur-
ing his time with the Rappahannock Electric 
Cooperative. 
I am proud of Mr. Farmer’s work with the 
REC, and I know he will be greatly missed. I 
have worked closely with Mr. Farmer and the 
REC, and I am honored to serve them in the 
First District of Virginia. Mr. Farmer has laid a 
strong foundation that will serve the REC in 
years to come. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me in recognition of Mr. Kent D. 
Farmer’s contributions to the Rappahannock 
Electric Cooperative and the First District of 
Virginia. I wish Mr. Farmer the best of luck in 
his next chapter, and I look forward to con-
tinuing to serve Mr. Farmer and the First Dis-
trict of Virginia.

HONORING OFFICER ANTHONY DIA 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great sadness that I rise today. In my district 
and my hometown city of Toledo, Ohio, our 
community is putting to rest a young Toledo 
Police Officer killed in the line of duty in the 
early hours of July 4th. 
Officer Anthony Dia, 26 years old, was 
known throughout our community as a dedi-
cated husband, father, son, valiant public serv-
ant, and revered member of the Muslim com-
munity. In the words of his wife, Jayme Dia, 
he worked every day of his life to provide for 
his family, including their two sons, Younes 
and Maytham. He lived and breathed family. 
In Officer Dia’s final words, which he radioed 
to the department after being fatally wounded 
were: ‘‘Tell my family I love them.’’ 
Officer Dia’s death serves as a telling re-
minder of the constant dangers law enforce-
ment officers face every single day in service 
to our communities. Officer Dia died a hero— 
Toledo will never forget his service and the ul-
timate sacrifice he made for the safety and se-
curity of our city and our families. 
I join in spirit with our community in Toledo 
to pay respects at Officer Dia’s memorial serv-
ice today. My sincerest condolences and pray-
ers are with Officer Dia’s family, the Toledo 
Police Department, and the entire Toledo 
community during this in extraordinarily difficult 
time. Our hearts are broken. 
In his memory, today in Washington D.C., 
an American flag is being hoisted above the 
U.S. Capitol in his memory to be presented in 
lasting gratitude for his laying down of his life 
for those he was sworn to protect and serve. 
May the memory of Officer Anthony Dia live 
on in our hearts and in our community forever. 
IN RECOGNITION OF MICHAEL 
KEILHOLZ 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Michael Keilholz on his 
years of devotion to the Vocational Agriculture 
program and its students. Mr. Keilholz retired 
from Pleasant Hill High School after 31 years 
of teaching agriculture. 
Michael Keilholz grew up in the small 
Catholic community of Frankenstein, Missouri. 
He attended the University of Missouri and 
graduated in 1989. He had several different 
jobs before he began teaching at Pleasant Hill 
High School, where he remained for 26 years. 
Over the years he oversaw 77 American FFA

Perhaps the greatest achievement of all is 
the number of lives Mr. Keilholz has impacted 
over the years. Thousands of young people 
have been blessed by his tutelage as they 
have learned invaluable life lessons taught 
through agriculture, the leadership opportuni-
ties provided through FFA, and the work ethic

and commitment will leave a legacy of amaz-
ing future leaders in agriculture who will im-
pact our nation and our world. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Michael 
Keilholz for his hard work and dedication, and 
I thank him for his years of selfless devotion 
to agriculture.

INTRODUCTION OF THE AMERICAN 
FARMS, FOOD BANKS, AND FAMI-
LIES ACT 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, today, I 
am introducing the American Farms, Food 
Banks, and Families Act, which authorizes a 
new position within the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture (USDA) tasked with ensur-
ing the nation’s food supply chain remains a 
national priority. 
This legislation authorizes the establishment 
of an ‘‘Agriculture Supply Chain Adminis-
trator,’’ either designated or appointed by the 
Secretary of Agriculture within the USDA. The 
Administrator is charged with developing effi-
ciencies and addressing key challenges within 
the domestic agriculture food supply chain. 
Key points to address by the Administrator 
include: identifying barriers, either regulatory 
or statutory, which prevent or inhibit domestic 
growers from offering their product to the do-
mestic market through food distribution enti-
ties; promoting the domestic supply chain; and 
connecting growers with surplus products with 
appropriate food distribution organizations. 
The Administrator is also tasked with con-
vening a Federal Advisory Committee with the 
USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), 
other appropriate federal agencies, and indus-
try stakeholders to collaborate and advise the 
Administrator on addressing inefficiencies. 
Finally, the American Farms, Food Banks, 
and Families Act will establish—in coordina-
tion with AMS and industry stakeholders—a 
national database to record and report excess 
agricultural products and food distribution or-
ganizations in need of the available products.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
CHARLEIGH FORD 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of veteran 
Charleigh Ford, who passed away on Monday, 
June 27, due to COVID–19 and dementia 
complications. 
Charleigh’s life began on October 20, 1941, 
in Columbus, Mississippi. Charleigh was a 
man who loved to share stories, stories that 
dated back to his time as a paperboy, and 
riding bikes on dirt hills with the other boys in 
the area. He would eventually outgrow the role 
of paperboy and would take on the role of a 
team member—in football, track, and the 
United States Air Force. 
After graduating from Lee High, Charleigh 
stuck to his Mississippi roots and attended 
Mississippi State University, where he met his 
wife, Lillian Hixon ‘‘Lillajo’’ Ford. Little did 
Charleigh know that his impact on the world 
was just beginning after he graduated from 
Mississippi State University. After college, a 
wedding, and the birth of his first son, 
Charleigh was deployed to Vietnam for a year, 
writing letters to Lillian every day. 
Charleigh didn’t stop pursuing his passions 
even after the war. He later found his place in 
the Chamber of Commerce and Economic De-
velopment business, making his most signifi-
cant impact on Lowndes County. He was in-
credibly instrumental in forming the ‘‘Golden 
Triangle Link’’ to recruit industries to Colum-
bus and surrounding areas. 
Of all of Charleigh’s accomplishments, his 
family was his pride and joy. Once he had 
grandchildren, his life was complete. He was 
such a devoted grandfather, the ladies at 
daycare had to tell him to stop looking through 
the window at his granddaughter because she 
would get upset every time he left. When they 
were old enough to spend the night, he would 
have all of them over so they could get 
McDonald’s pancakes in the morning. He 
would always treat the kids to whatever they 
wanted. 
Charleigh’s life was one of service, grace, 
and love for his family and community and will 
be greatly missed by all whom he encoun-
tered. 
Left to cherish his memory is his daughter, 
Michelle Turberville; his two grandsons, Josh 
and Drew Turberville; his brother, Jimmy 
Young; as well as many other friends and ex-
tended family members.

IN RECOGNITION OF MEALS FOR 
HEROES MIAMI 
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, founded 
on April 1, 2020, Meals for Heroes Miami has 
become foundational to South Florida’s efforts 
to combat the COVID–19 pandemic. This or-
ganization was founded by Miami natives Will 
Osborne and Karen Bechtel, and Will’s son 
Mac, a New York-based restauranteur. 
This non-profit, donation-based organization 
emerged to address two issues stemming 
from the COVID–19 pandemic: feeding the 
stressed and exhausted frontline workers risk-
ing their lives daily and protecting jobs at 
Miami restaurants. Meals for Heroes Miami, 
powered by community donations, serves both 
these needs by purchasing and delivering 
meals from local restaurants to frontline work-
ers. 
By mid-May, Meals for Heroes Miami had 
purchased and delivered 10,000 meals to 
workers; fed teams at 24 hospitals, testing 
centers, first responder departments, prisons, 
and other locations; and preserved approxi-
mately 50 jobs at 22 partner restaurants. The 
organization has only continued to grow in the 
time since. 
This kind of innovation is precisely what we 
need in communities across the country to 
conquer this pandemic and help families sup-
port themselves. I commend Will, Karen, Mac, 
and all those who have donated to this fan-
tastic cause for their service to our shared 
community.

HONORING JAMES DONALD KERR 
HON. DAN BISHOP 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
James Donald Kerr, who we lost last month at 
the age of 86. Don was an enterprising cotton 
farmer, and every aspect of cotton production 
was a joy to him. 
Don was born in his grandparents’ farm-
house in Marvin, North Carolina. After high 
school, he attended North Carolina State Uni-
versity to pursue a degree in agribusiness. He 
left his junior year to join the U.S. Army, 
where he served with distinction before farm-
ing with his parents. As a member of the 
Southern Cotton Growers Board, the National 
Cotton Council, and the National Cotton Board 
for over three decades, Don made immense 
contributions to the cotton industry, with his 
passion leading him to researching and devel-
oping the crop for international markets. 
Don lived his life doing what he loved, while 
also making the world a better place. I was 
privileged to know him and call him a friend. 
Today, it is my honor to memorialize his leg-
acy.

COMMITTMENT TO SUSTAINED RE-
NEWAL 
AND 
CONTINUITY 
OF 
OUR 
FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT 
FOLLOWING EVERY ELECTION 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with respect and upon reflection of the 
core tenets of our democracy: our federal 
elections and their aftermath. 
As you know, Madam Speaker, our nation 
boasts a steady history, no matter the cir-
cumstance, of maintaining a peaceful and effi-
cient process upon the conclusion of our pres-
idential elections. Whether a President con-
tinues in office for another term, experiences 
defeat, or concludes holding office due to the 
Constitutional term limit, our democracy has 
flourished to the benefit of the American peo-
ple for centuries. Our streak of peaceful transi-
tions of power remains unbroken, intentionally 
and without accident. This reflects the genius 
of our founders and the will of the American 
people to continually commit to forming a 
more perfect union. 
In America, our government and its suc-
cessful function does not depend on one per-
son or political party. Rather, our federal gov-
ernment and its institutions represent the glory 
and the privilege bestowed by the system of a 
federated republic. And while to some, the 
peaceful transition in the aftermath of our 
presidential election may seem perfunctory, 
our society and the success of our economy 
depend on the reliable transition of presidents- 
elect or presidents continuing to a second 
term. 
It is without question essential that the tal-
ented and dedicated public servants in our 
federal government are able to serve the 
American people following the aftermath of 
any election. Such duties include ensuring no 
veteran is denied benefits and no Social Secu-
rity recipient misses a check. Professional civil 
servants—nonpartisan and the best in their 
fields—provide continuity and ensure that gov-
ernment stays focused on serving the Amer-
ican people. From air traffic controllers to food 
safety inspectors to servicemembers defend-
ing our nation at home and abroad, the federal

workforce ensures that citizen services are un-
interrupted by a change in administration. 
As you may acknowledge, Madam Speaker, 
it was of the highest civilian honor for me to 
serve as a member of then President-elect 
Barack Obama’s transition team, and to en-
gage with the apolitical workforce. While the 
country faced economic peril, I formally joined 
the Administration just a few weeks after the 
President was sworn into office, as a White 
House appointee serving in the United States 
Department of the Treasury, alongside Presi-
dential appointees of the former Administration 
of George W. Bush. I witnessed first-hand how 
a peaceful and collegial transition of power is 
achieved. In the process, I garnered tremen-
dous respect for the dedicated career civil 
servants who continue to serve no matter the 
political outcome. Today, that same workforce 
is looking at two possibilities come November: 
preparing for a new administration or con-
tinuing to govern as part of the current admin-
istration. 
If, following the results of the November 3rd 
election, a presidential transition falls upon our 
federal government, a large task is at hand for 
the new administration. While this is not as-
sumed, it is a scenario worthy of planning and 
consideration. Just as, if the current president 
is reaffirmed and continues to a second term, 
the duties of his administration will continue. 
Peace and trust in either scenario is para-
mount. In any such outcome, I ask of my fel-
low countrymen and women and with specific 
request of my colleagues within this coequal 
branch of government to pledge to achieve a 
more perfect union and recognize that in No-
vember, millions will see their votes cast for 
the winner of the Presidential election, just as 
millions will see their vote cast for the runner- 
up of the election. We may suspect or assume 
the continued and sustained activities of our 
federal government, and recommitting to this 
assurance is a healthy and productive exer-
cising of our authorities. In particular, as col-
lective bodies within the Congress and federal 
agencies, it is our cooperative responsibility to 
ensure strife and upheaval does not impede 
the critical duties of our civilian workforce. We, 
as an elected body of federal representatives 
oversee, fund, and authorize the efforts of our 
federal agencies and maintain a responsibility 
and dedication to their success, particularly in 
the aftermath of presidential elections. 
Today I officially submit as record to this 
chamber a request to my colleagues. We, as 
federated leaders and representatives, may 
express dismay and disagreement with one 
another and with election outcomes, but we 
also set the tone to continue the peaceful 
process following from the votes cast by mil-
lions and preparation for ongoing governance 
and legislative affairs. And we certainly main-
tain an authority to hold reckless actions of 
federal officials accountable. 
Many in this Chamber on both sides of the 
aisle have dedicated their life’s work to achiev-
ing equality, and all took an oath upon being 
a sworn member of the United States House 
of Representatives to support and defend the 
Constitution of the United States of America. 
Our duties are not just reflections; they are ac-
tions and commitments that form a more per-
fect union and promote the general welfare as 
this nation continues to thrive as a free and 
safe democracy. As we exercise the full abili-
ties vested in us as men and women within 
this form of public trust, we commit to contin-
ued renewal and restoring of our government 
with each election.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
MR. JERRY YUCHIEH WANG 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the service of Jerry Yuchieh Wang. Mr. 
Wang is an outgoing Senior Officer in the 
Congressional Liaison Division of the Taipei 
Economic and Cultural Representative Office 
(TECRO), which is the de facto embassy of 
Taiwan. Mr. Wang is returning to Taiwan for 
his next assignment in the Department of 
International Organizations, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Dur-
ing his service as the TECRO contact for my 
office, as well as the House Armed Services 
Committee, Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee and Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, Mr. Wang has been an invaluable re-
source for my staff and me. 
In 2015, Mr. Wang was hand-picked to 
serve as a congressional liaison for TECRO. 
During his five and a half years of service in 
this position, Mr. Wang’s insights assisted 
Members in gaining a deeper understanding of 
the importance of the United States’ relation-
ship with Taiwan and facilitated visits between 
U.S. and Taiwanese officials at all levels. 
Since arriving in Washington, Mr. Wang has 
played an important role in supporting the 
strengthening of US-Taiwan security coopera-
tion, personnel exchanges, and the provision 
of critical defense articles as required by the 
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. He was also an 
integral member of the TECRO team sup-
porting Taiwan’s participation in international 
Organizations and US-Taiwan trade relations. 
Additionally, Mr. Wang has organized and 
overseen many Congressional Member and 
Staff Delegation visits to Taiwan, including my 
own. 
Mr. Wang has served in Taiwan’s Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs since 2010. Early in his diplo-
matic career, he worked in the Department of 
International Organizations on Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) related issues. 
Mr. Wang received a Master’s degree in Polit-
ical Science from the National Taiwan Univer-
sity. 
Mr. Wang has been a tireless advocate for 
the universal values of liberty, democracy, and 
the respect for the integrity of individual 
rights—values that are shared by the people 
of the United States and Taiwan. Our world is 
a better place because of the work of leaders 
like Mr. Wang. While Mr. Wang secured many 
legislative victories for Taiwan during his ten-
ure in Washington, D.C., he made even more 
long-lasting friendships. My colleagues and 
our staff are proud to call him a friend, and we 
hope to see him back in Washington, D.C. 
one day. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF SISTER 
PAMELA MARIE BUGANSKI 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor and celebrate the transformational life of 
Sister Pamela Marie Buganski. Hailing from 
Toledo, Ohio’s Old Orchard neighborhood, 
Sister Pamela began her service to the Toledo 
community in 1975. For forty-five long years, 
she dedicated her life in service to her reli-
gious community, embracing the poor and 
needy in communities across Northern Ohio, 
Guatemala, Papua New Guinea, Mexico, and 
Texas. 
I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to 
her parents, Dr. Raymond and Ruth Buganski; 
her four sisters Cynthia, Lynn, Laura, and 
Joan; her five brothers Mark, Joseph, Robert, 
David, and Michael; and her numerous nieces 
and nephews. 
Most recently I had the honor of meeting 
Sister Pamela again during my visit to the 
U.S. Southern Border with the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus in January 2020. I was so 
impressed by her dedication to help those 
struggling to survive in the face of dire cir-
cumstances. She stood at the edge of free-
dom and hope for them. Many of those de-
tained had traveled thousands of miles to the 
U.S. border to seek refuge only to find the 
passage blocked by the Trump Administra-
tion’s immoral ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy. 
What we saw were families fleeing violence 
forced to live in squalor in the outskirts of our 
country by a broken immigration system that 
has little regard for the human condition. She 
bore witness to the anguish, misery, illness, 
and desperation. Sister Pamela recognized 
that we are all truly God’s children. She treat-
ed everyone who crossed her path with the 
love and respect endowed to them by our Cre-
ator. 
Sister Pamela was born in St. Louis, Mis-
souri in 1956 and her family eventually moved 
to Toledo, OH. There she attended St. Pius 
and Notre Dame Academy and eventually en-
tered the Sisters of Notre Dame in 1975, pro-
fessing her vows of poverty, chastity, and obe-
dience in 1978. 
She pursued graduate studies at the Univer-
sity of Dayton and the University of Notre 
Dame. Recognizing the importance of invest-
ing in our nation’s youth, she dedicated twelve 
years of her life teaching at junior high schools 
across Northwestern Ohio and then another 
ten years teaching math and computer 
science at St. Mary High School and Notre 
Dame Academy. 
Sister Pamela’s deep devotion to her faith 
and service took her on three mission trips, 
one to Papua New Guinea and two to Guate-
mala. After studying Spanish, Sister Pamela’s 
drive to support social justice initiatives and 
marginalized communities brought her to 
Texas. 
Here, she helped devastated communities 
after Hurricane Harvey and was accredited by 
CLINIC to advocate for those seeking refuge 
at the U.S.’s Southern border. Her sister Cyn-
thia described her best as someone who ‘‘was 
a genuine caregiver from the beginning . . . 
she could bring calm to chaos’’. 
On behalf of so many grateful communities 
in Northern Ohio and across our hemisphere,

HONORING THE SERVICE OF DR. 
THOMAS ELY OF TENNESSEE 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Dr. Thomas Ely 
for his distinguished career in the medical pro-
fession and recent election as the 124th Presi-
dent of the American Osteopathic Association. 
Tennesseans across our great state are proud 
to join me in celebrating his accomplishments 
and election to the highest leadership role in 
the osteopathic profession. 
Dr. Ely’s career has been marked by dedi-
cation and tireless leadership in the medical 
field. As a fellow Tennessean, he served his 
patients with care and represented our great 
state for over 30 years as a delegate to the 
AOA House of Delegates, as well as serving 
as the President of the Tennessee Osteo-
pathic Medical Association (TOMA). 
His desire to help others led him to join the 
United States Army, where he served honor-
ably for 20 years, and where he received 
many honors, including the Legion of Merit 
and the Bronze Star. Even after retiring from 
service, he eagerly answered the call to sup-
port our troops during Operation Desert Storm. 
It is the sacrifices of brave men and women 
like Dr. Ely that has built our country, and we 
are forever indebted to his service. 
I am honored to have worked alongside Dr. 
Ely in the medical profession. On behalf of the 
United States Congress, I wish to commend 
Dr. Ely for his service, and I congratulate him 
as he continues his lifelong career of serving 
others, now as the President of the American 
Osteopathic Association.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF ALAN S. BECKER 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and legacy of my 
dear friend, co-founder of Becker and Poliakoff 
law firm, Alan S. Becker. Alan’s quest for a 
law degree brought him to Florida where he 
attended the University of Miami School of 
Law. Alan graduated in 1969 and scored the 
highest grade on that years legal Bar exam. 
Early in his career he worked in the Office of 
the Attorney General and as an assistant pub-
lic defender. 
At the age of 26, Alan became the youngest 
person elected to the Florida House of Rep-
resentatives, serving three terms from 1972 to 
1978. Alan pioneered community association 
law with his long-time business partner, Gary 
Poliakoff, initially working out of the trunk of a 
car representing condo owners. Their law firm 
has since grown into one of the largest in Flor-
ida, with offices in New York, New Jersey, and 
Washington, D.C. 
The official accolades and honors for Alan 
are too numerous to count, however, I want to 
highlight a few. Alan passed the Czech Re-
public Bar exam in 1992 and served as hon-
orary counsel there until 2016. He was a pas-
sionate writer, teacher and painter. He au-
thored two books, taught ‘‘The Business of 
Law’’ at the University of Miami School of 
Law, and lectured on leadership at Keiser Uni-
versity. Alan sat on the Board of Directors for 
Enterprise Florida and received the Governor’s 
Business Ambassador Medallion for his con-
tributions to economic development. 
Madam Speaker, Alan was a lifelong Demo-
crat, but always reached across the aisle and 
worked in conjunction with others to find the 
best solution for our community, a quality that 
I honor and respect and is one of the many 
outstanding qualities of his character that 
made me proud to call him a friend. I extend 
my heartfelt condolences to Alan’s family and 
friends and I pray that they find comfort during 
this extremely difficult time. Alan will be dearly 
missed.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ELI KENT 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of an out-
standing young man whose life was taken too 
soon. Eli Kent, the son of Nicky and Alisha 
Gray Kent, passed away at the age of 10 on 
June 25, 2020, at the North Mississippi Med-
ical Center. 
Eli was known for his love of travel and Ole 
Miss sports. When he wasn’t watching the ex-
citement on Swayze field, Eli was watching his 
sister dance or the Wheel of Fortune. He was 
also a special member of Bethel Baptist 
Church, sharing his smile with the many peo-
ple who knew and loved him. 
Left to cherish his memory are his parents, 
Nicky and Alisha Kent; his sister, Kylee Kent; 
his grandparents, Jeff and Lori Gray, and 
James Kent; as well as many friends and ex-
tended family members. 
Eli suffered from spinal muscular atrophy, 
and while we mourn his loss, we know he is 
pain-free and safe in the arms of our Lord.

ceive further assistance and ultimately win a

HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the beautiful life of Marie J. 
Bonamici-Woodcock, mother of my esteemed 
colleague, 
Congresswoman 
SUZANNE 
BONAMICI, who passed away on June 14, 
2020, at the age of 91. 
Marie was born on August 10, 1928, in De-
troit, Michigan. Growing up, she studied music 
and had a profound appreciation for the arts. 
In 1948, Marie married and moved to Plym-
outh and then Northville, Michigan, where she 
raised three children, Andrew, SUZANNE, and 
James. She was an active member of the 
Northville Historical Society and the Detroit 
Folklore Society. 
She modeled for her children openness to 
ideas, respect for the environment, and a 
deep appreciation of diverse cultures. She in-
spired in them lifelong interests in music, art, 
world cultures, environmental protection, and 
human rights—all qualities that we admire 
about our colleague, Representative BONAMICI, 
today. 
Marie was preceded in death by her par-
ents; her two brothers, John and Robert Kehrl; 
and her husband, George. She is survived by 
her children, Andrew Bonamici (Beth), SU-
ZANNE BONAMICI (Michael Simon), and James 
Bonamici (Debra); grandchildren, Kate Flaim 
(Ben), Tom Bonamici, Andrew Simon, Peter 
Bonamici, Sara Simon, and Nicolas Bonamici; 
and three great-grandchildren, Tuck, Ellie, and

ety.

ZAC KERNS 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Zac Kerns upon 
his promotion from Lieutenant Colonel to Colo-
nel in the United States Army. Zac is a peer-
less example for hard work, dedication and 
excellence not only for the United States Mili-
tary, but also to his home town of St. Joseph, 
Missouri. 
After graduating from Missouri Western 
State University and being commissioned as 
an officer through their ROTC program, Zac 
was selected for the demanding Special 
Forces Qualification Course. This led to a six-
teen year career as a Green Beret. During 
that time, he led an element of Special Oper-
ations forces from four NATO nations. Zac 
then spent three years as Deputy Chief of 
Special Operations for the Middle East Oper-
ation Command Central. When Zac returned 
to the states, he did so as an instructor at the 
Command and General Staff College, where 
he began passing his real world knowledge to 
the next generation of officers. Since 2018, 
Zac has commanded the Assessment Squad-
ron of the Asymmetric Warfare Group where 
in addition to training future experts in asym-
metric warfare, also advised the army on es-
tablishing the Battalion and Brigade Com-
manders Assessment Program. Currently, Zac 
is a Fellow at the School for Advanced Military 
Studies at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. During 
his career, Zac has also earned three Bronze 
Stars, five Meritorious Service Medals, the 
Special Forces and Ranger Tabs, the Combat 
Infantryman’s Badge, Expert Infantry Badge, 
Senior Parachutist and Air Assault Badge. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in recognizing Zac Kerns for his promotion 
to Colonel in the United States Army. I would 
also like to recognize Colonel Kern’s family for 
a moment. His lovely wife, Rosemary, and 
sons, Kaiden, Kale and Liam, for their support 
of Zac as he’s served the United States of 
America. I want to thank Zac and his family, 
on behalf of the Sixth Congressional District, 
the State of Missouri and the United States of 
America for their ongoing service to each of 
us. I am proud to represent them in the United 
States Congress.

HONORING THE FAITHFUL SERV-
ICE OF CHIEF WARRANT OFFI-
CER MATTHEW BROWN OF TEN-
NESSEE 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Chief Warrant Of-
ficer Matthew Brown for his distinguished serv-
ice to this nation. 
Chief Brown served honorably in the United 
States Army for over three decades, dem-
onstrating exceptional skill and unparalleled 
valor in crucial combat operations. Early in his 
career, he served five years in the 82nd Air-
borne Division, deploying with the 17th Cav-
alry to Desert Shield and Desert Storm. He 
then joined the 101st Airborne Division before 
eventually being assigned to the nation’s elite 
160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment 
(Airborne) in 1998. 
As a helicopter pilot with the Night Stalkers, 
Chief Brown deployed in the initial invasion of 
Iraq in 2003, and subsequently completed 
over 34 deployments with our nation’s tier one 
special operators in support of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and 
Operation New Dawn. 
On one such mission, while under intense 
enemy fire, Chief Warrant Officer Brown suc-
cessfully destroyed multiple enemy positions, 
enabling ground forces to organize defensive 
positions. For his gallantry, which saved many 
lives that day, he was awarded the Silver Star. 
Chief Brown was awarded a Distinguished Fly-
ing Cross for the successful destruction of nu-
merous enemy combatants during a classified 
mission in 2005. 
Chief Warrant Officer Brown will forever be 
an example to countless soldiers and Army 
aviators. His service is historic. He exemplifies 
the virtues of courage and patriotism and it is 
fitting that we honor him as he concludes a 
long and faithful career. On behalf of the 
United States Congress, I wish to commend 
Chief Brown for his service, and I congratulate 
him on the occasion of his retirement from the 
United States Army.

RECOGNIZING ERIC MILLER OF 
JORDAN 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Eric Miller of Jordan for his 20- 
plus years of service to Garfield County as an 
extension agent and a mentor to the commu-
nity’s young people. 
For more than two decades, Eric has served 
as a Montana State University extension agent 
in Garfield County. He’s a proud Bobcat who 
earned his master’s degree in animal science 
with an emphasis in genetics at MSU. His 
connection with MSU and his love of agri-
culture brought him to Jordan as the county’s 
extension agent. 
Eric loves his job. He enjoys helping people, 
and he’ll tell you no one day is like another. 
He wears many hats. Some days, he teaches 
adult education classes. Others, he solves 
problems. Still others, he advises the county 
and local farmers. Eric helps farmers increase 
production and profitability throughout the 
county, but he acknowledges these are chal-
lenging times for our agricultural community. 
Eric also focuses his efforts and energies on 
supporting the area’s youth. For more than 20 
years, Eric has been the Garfield County 4–H 
director. While agriculture is a big focus of 4– 
H, the group’s main priority is to empower 
young people with skills and through experi-
ences. Focused on their interests, the young 
people undertake hands-on projects, whether 
it’s raising and breeding livestock, farming, 
wood working, welding, cooking, shooting 
sports, or another activity. Through continuing 
education and mentorship, 4–H provides them 
the opportunity to grow and develop. 
Eric’s favorite part is watching kids learn. He 
says there’s nothing like seeing a kid’s light go 
on when working on a project. He says it’s a 
powerful moment when a participant comes to 
fully understand his or her project, and you get 
a lot of those moments a kid is involved in 4– 
H for years. 
For Garfield County, 4–H is more than a 
club. It’s part of their community. It’s a way for 
kids to interact and build relationships beyond 
school. One of the biggest events in the area 
is the Garfield County Fair where 4–H mem-
bers showcase their projects for everyone to 
see. It’s the culmination of all their hard work 
and dedication. 
Madam Speaker, for his decades of helping 
people in his community, from farmers to 
young people, I recognize Eric Miller of Jordan 
for his Spirit of Montana.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
MARTHA RUTH SANSOM WHITE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Martha Ruth 
Sansom White, who passed away on June 24, 
surrounded by her family. 
Born on April 18, 1940, Martha was the first-
born of three girls to the loving parents of 
Russell Tilden and Idelle Gray Sansom. Fol-
lowing in her parents’ footsteps, she received 
her Bachelor of Education from the University 
of Mississippi. While at Ole Miss, she not only 
earned her degree but met and fell in love 
with Bill White. They were married on May 12, 
1962, and were happily married for 58 years. 
Martha continued her passion for education 
by eaming her Masters in Education from Mis-
sissippi State University. Like her parents, she 
went on to teach at Itawamba Community Col-
lege and would later teach the vocational pro-
gram at Northeast Community College, only 
retiring after 37 years. 
Left to cherish her memory is her husband 
William ‘‘Bill’’ Dyke White; her daughter, Kristy 
Moore Gibson; her son, John Russell White; 
as well as many other friends and extended 
family members. 
Martha’s life was one of grace and love for 
her family and community. She will be greatly 
missed by all whom she encountered.

HONORING THE FAITHFUL SERV-
ICE OF POLICE OFFICER DESTIN 
LEGIEZA OF TENNESSEE 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor and remember Officer 
Destin Legieza for his distinguished career in 
service of his beloved community of Brent-
wood, Tennessee. 
Officer Legieza honorably served with the 
Brentwood Police Department for five years, 
demonstrating a commitment to excellence 
and selflessness. In 2016, he was selected as 
Officer of the Year by the Brentwood Morning 
Rotary Club and in 2017, he received the 
Chiefs Sheep Dog Award for outstanding po-
lice work and cooperation among law enforce-
ment agencies. 
His life defined service to others. In his free 
time, he was involved in Special Olympics and 
a community flag football team. Most recently, 
he was selected to serve on the Crisis Inter-
vention Team (CIT), an innovative first-re-
sponder model of police-based crisis interven-
tion training for de-escalation. 
However, before starting his training for CIT, 
on June 18th, 2020, Officer Legieza was killed 
in the line of duty, being hit by a suspected 
drunk driver head-on. Only 30 years old, Offi-
cer Legieza was, in the words of Brentwood 
Mayor Rhea Little, ‘‘the apex of those who 
serve.’’ 
Officer Legieza came from a long line of po-
lice officers, with his father being a lieutenant 
in the Franklin Police Department and his 
grandfather serving in the CSX Railroad Po-
lice. Officer Legieza no longer patrols the 
streets of Brentwood, but his memory lives on 
in the family whom he loved and the commu-
nity in which he served. 
Officer Legieza’s life of selfless dedication to 
protect and serve our community is an inspira-
tion to all Americans. On behalf of the United 
States Congress, I wish to honor Officer 
Legieza for his service and express our deep-
est sympathies to his friends and family.

MELANIE ARLENE 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 9, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, it is 
with a heavy heart that I stand today to re-
member the brilliant life of Melanie Arlene 
Thwing-Eastman. 
Melanie and I met while serving in the 
American Bar Association’s Law Student Divi-
sion. With Melanie’s easy-going charm and 
sarcastic humor, it just made sense we would 
become friends. Her zest for life, personal in-
tegrity, and her genuine passion for the prac-
tice of law made her a natural leader. 
Melanie knew how to brighten a room. She 
knew that kindness went a long way. And she 
knew that she could not stand idly by when in-
justice occurred, and she was a fearless 
truthteller who always strove to do what was 
right. She made a real difference in the court-
room and the classroom and has left the world 
a better and brighter place. 
My deepest sympathies and prayers are 
with her husband Justin and her family, 
friends, and the many lives she touched. I join 
them in mourning this tragic loss.
