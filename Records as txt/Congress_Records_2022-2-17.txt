The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
CRIME 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
for the first time in 12 years, an out-
right majority of Americans say crime 
has gotten worse in their area over the 
past year. 
Many Democrats have spent the last 
year and a half trying to defund police, 
smear law enforcement, and go soft on 
crime. As a result, innocent citizens 
have spent a year and a half watching 
murders, carjackings, and other violent 
crimes literally skyrocket. 
On Monday, in my hometown of Lou-
isville, KY, we were stunned by what 
appears to have been an assassination 
attempt against a Jewish mayoral can-
didate by a prominent far-left activist 
who previously called for defunding our 
police department. 
This far-left Black Lives Matter ac-
tivist 
and 
defund-the-police 
cheer-
leader walked into a Jewish Demo-
crat’s 
campaign 
headquarters 
and 
opened fire. 
Obviously, every aspect of this is still 
under investigation, including the sus-
pect’s mental condition. But guess 
what. He has already been let out of 
jail—already let out of jail. 
A leftwing bail fund partnered with 
BLM Louisville to bail him out. Less 
than 48 hours after this activist tried 
to literally murder a politician, the 
radical left bailed their comrade out of 
jail. 
This is just jaw-dropping. The inno-
cent people of Louisville deserve bet-
ter. 
Since 2020, a long list of prominent 
corporations have donated or pledged 
enormous amounts of money to the 
radical nationwide BLM parent organi-
zation. One wonders if any of their cor-
porate money helped spring this would- 
be assassin from jail.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S758 
February 17, 2022 
Now, I am confident that if an activ-
ist claiming to be conservative tried to 
assassinate a politician, whatever his 
mental state, the media would open a 
24/7 national conversation about rhet-
oric on the right. Somehow, I doubt at-
tempted murder by a BLM activist will 
get that same treatment. I doubt we 
will 
have 
a 
national 
conversation 
about the constant chorus of powerful 
voices calling our society evil. 
I raise this double standard because 
it is not limited to media coverage. We 
have seen this extend into our legal 
system itself. 
In May of 2020, when Minneapolis was 
engulfed in lawless riots, one rioter 
broke into a pawn shop and started a 
fire that burned it down. His act of 
arson actually killed somebody. But 
the Federal attorneys, who were sup-
posed to represent the victim and the 
people, went out of their way to push 
for an unusually lenient sentence. 
They asked for the typical sentencing 
guideline to be cut in half. Why? Well, 
because, they wrote, the defendant was 
an angry political protester who sim-
ply lost his cool. They wrote, ‘‘As any-
one 
watching 
the 
news 
worldwide 
knows, many other people in Min-
nesota were similarly caught up’’—as if 
that were an excuse. This is the sen-
tencing memo from the prosecutors. It 
reads like it was ghostwritten by the 
defense. They even tried to quote Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., to explain 
why this guy burned down a pawn shop. 
What a backward attitude. 
We cannot have Federal officials act-
ing like leftwing political violence is 
more acceptable than any other vio-
lence. If anything, political violence is 
uniquely unacceptable in a democratic 
republic. 
Now, I placed a hold on President 
Biden’s nominee to take over as U.S. 
attorney in Minnesota until he pledged 
he would keep political favoritism out 
of his prosecutions. Fortunately, he 
quickly said so in writing. He also 
knows Republicans will be watching. 
The American people need public 
servants to crack down on crime and 
defend their safety—crack down on 
crime and defend their safety—less 
pandering to woke mobs; more pro-
tecting innocent families. 
ENERGY 
Madam President, now on an entirely 
different matter, Washington Demo-
crats’ inflation is slamming consumers 
with the highest prices in 40 years. One 
of the toughest blows has been the 
soaring cost of a trip to the gas pump. 
A gallon of regular costs a full dollar 
more today than it did a year ago. 
So after triggering a historic run of 
inflation and hammering American 
producers with anti-energy policies de-
signed to restrict supply, our Demo-
cratic colleagues are suddenly talking 
about gas prices. Here is their bold, 
creative plan: temporarily suspending 
the gas tax, to the tune of 18 cents—oh, 
and excluding diesel—a slap in the face 
to truckers and a further burden on the 
supply chain. Oh, and just to make the 
political games transparent, they want 
this to expire right after the midterms, 
as soon as the next Congress is sworn 
in. 
Democrats want to blow a $20 billion 
hole in highway funding so they can 
try to mask the effects of their own 
liberal policies on working Americans. 
They have spent the entire year waging 
a holy war on affordable American en-
ergy, and now—now—they want to use 
a pile of taxpayers’ money to literally 
hide the consequences. 
As the senior Senator from West Vir-
ginia has pointed out, ‘‘People want 
their bridges and their roads, and we 
have an infrastructure bill we just 
passed this summer, and they want to 
take all that away. It just doesn’t 
make sense.’’ 
He added that this half-baked pro-
posal doesn’t make any more sense 
than the President’s pointless decision 
to take oil out of the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve last year. 
President Clinton’s Treasury Sec-
retary, Larry Summers, called this 
stunt ‘‘short-sighted, ineffective, goofy 
and gimmicky.’’ That is the Secretary 
of the Treasury in the Bill Clinton ad-
ministration. 
Back in 2008, then-Candidate Obama 
himself said this: 
We’re arguing over a gimmick that would 
save you half a tank of gas over the course 
of the entire summer so that everyone in 
Washington can pat themselves on the back 
and say they did something. Well, let me tell 
you, this isn’t an idea designed to get you 
through the summer—it’s designed to get 
them through an election. 
That is Barack Obama in 2008, and he 
was right. 
Look, if Democrats actually want to 
help the American people fill their 
tanks, they wouldn’t have been attack-
ing American energy every way pos-
sible for the entire year. President 
Biden made killing the Keystone XL 
Pipeline his day 1 priority. Democrats 
voted in lockstep to endorse President 
Biden’s ban on new energy exploration 
on Federal lands. At every turn, in 
every way, Democrats have made it 
harder to produce affordable and reli-
able American energy. Take any form 
of energy, and if people in San Fran-
cisco don’t find it fashionable, the 
Biden administration has gone after it. 
Three years ago, under Republican 
policies, the United States became a 
net exporter of oil for the first time in 
more than 70 years. From a sheer 
mathematical perspective, for the very 
first time since World War II, we were 
producing all that we needed and then 
some. Alas, a very different philosophy 
now controls Washington. In President 
Biden’s first year, our own oil imports 
from Russia—from Russia—hit a new 
alltime high. 
But as we speak, events in Eastern 
Europe are reminding the entire world 
that energy abundance is not just 
about families’ pocketbooks; there is a 
colossal strategic cost when our Nation 
and our allies become economically de-
pendent on countries that don’t like us 
very much. 
Some of our European allies have 
spent many years voluntarily winding 
down reliable sources like nuclear and 
coal and refusing to tap into their own 
considerable natural gas reserves via 
fracking. Instead, they gambled on less 
reliable sources and outsourced their 
perceived dirty work to places like 
Russia. Western European elites de-
cided they wanted their energy produc-
tion out of sight and out of mind, and 
Putin was all too happy to oblige them. 
Even after Russia invaded Georgia in 
2008 and Ukraine in 2014, Germany will-
ingly 
signed 
up 
for 
Putin’s 
Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline. It would negate 
Ukraine’s own pipelines and deny the 
money and leverage that Ukraine needs 
to keep Russia at bay, but Germany 
backed it. Meanwhile, Berlin put off 
building liquid natural gas terminals, 
instead choosing to rely on Russian gas 
and refusing to diversify its import op-
tions. I am hopeful the latest indica-
tions that Germany is reconsidering 
this will prove to be accurate. 
The Biden administration is scram-
bling to connect our at-risk allies with 
some energy resources from every-
where else—everywhere else. But it 
should not have taken this latest 
Kremlin misbehavior to remind the 
West 
that 
self-sufficiency 
actually 
matters. It matters. And Democrats 
have still not flinched in their broader 
war against our own—our own—U.S. 
production. 
Glitzy summits in Paris and finger- 
wagging climate rhetoric are one way 
to approach energy policy. Actually ex-
ploring and developing abundant, af-
fordable, and reliable domestic energy 
is another approach, and that is the ap-
proach that will actually work. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
DOJ APPOINTMENTS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, most 
people would be stumped by the ques-
tion I am about to ask, and that is, 
when it comes to the commission of 
crime, what is the largest criminal in-
vestigation in the history of the United 
States? The answer is January 6, 2021. 
Over 725 individuals have been charged 
with a Federal crime as a result of that 
insurrectionist mob that descended on 
the Capitol. 
The reason I raise that is that we are 
going 
through 
regular—sometimes 
daily, 
sometimes 
weekly—lectures 
from Republicans about who is soft on 
crime, who is really on the side of the 
American people when it comes to de-
fending their homes and their families. 
I listen to this debate on a regular 
basis as chairman of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee. Every single nominee 
who comes from the Biden White House 
is subject to being challenged as to 
whether they are going to defund the 
police or whether they are soft on 
crime. Yet I have to say that it is hard 
to explain that these same Republicans 
asking 
these 
pointed 
questions 
to 
nominees are nowhere to be found 
when it comes to discussing January 6, 
2021. In fact, many of them were cheer-
leaders and apologists for the very

February 17, 2022 
demonstrators who came into this 
United States Capitol. 
To think that a national political 
party like the Republican Party of the 
United States of America branded this 
insurrectionist mob and their attack 
on the Capitol as ‘‘legitimate political 
discourse’’—that was the official state-
ment, the unanimous statement of the 
Republican Party. 
Now, a few Republican Senators have 
dissented. Thank you. But why haven’t 
more? Why won’t they step up and say 
a crime is a crime? If over 700 people 
descended on this Capitol and are being 
charged with a crime, they should have 
to pay the price, whatever it happens 
to be, because this just wasn’t some 
idle political exercise. At the end of 
the day, we had 6 people dead as a re-
sult of that insurrectionist mob, in-
cluding law enforcement officers, and 
140 law enforcement officers attacked 
during the course of that day. We all 
saw the videos. There are plenty of 
them. 
Imagine, if you will, the so-called in-
nocent, legitimate political discourse 
travelers to Washington just happened 
to bring bear spray with them so they 
could spray police in the face with a 
poisonous compound that could, in 
fact, harm them and did. Does that 
sound like a group of political tourists 
to you? It doesn’t to me. These are vio-
lent individuals who are being called to 
task for having assaulted this Capitol, 
broken down the windows and the 
doors, came in here aping along these 
desks in the Chamber, forcing the Vice 
President of the United States and 
Senators who were there that day—and 
I was one of them—to exit by the back-
door for their lives. And here we have 
this ‘‘We are not soft on crime’’ mes-
sage from Republicans who are making 
excuses, not to mention the former 
President, Donald Trump, who said 
that given the opportunity, he would 
pardon these demonstrators. It is no 
surprise in light of what he has done in 
the past. 
But being lectured to regularly by 
the Republicans about who respects 
law enforcement and who is soft on 
crime—most of them cannot answer 
the basic question of what they would 
do when it comes to the January 6 
demonstrators, and the answer they 
give is totally insufficient. 
Madam President, you know person-
ally, because you were here on the 
floor yesterday, that isn’t all of it. I 
listen to all this talk about prosecutors 
doing their job, and I can’t help but 
think what we went through yesterday 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate when 
the junior Senator from Arkansas, a 
Republican Senator, stood here and 
vainly tried to defend what he is doing. 
Do you know what he is doing? You 
do personally. He is stopping the ap-
pointment of U.S. attorneys, Federal 
prosecutors, in State after State, and 
he is stopping the appointment of U.S. 
marshals who keep those courtrooms 
safe and the judges safe and transport 
prisoners and seek out fugitives. He is 
personally stopping them from being 
appointed in the ordinary course of 
business in the U.S. Senate. 
You have to ask yourself why. There 
must be a problem with their qualifica-
tions. No. There is not a single ques-
tion being asked about the qualifica-
tions of these individuals. 
Mr. Frierson in the State of Nevada, 
a person whom you and Senator COR-
TEZ MASTO described on the floor yes-
terday who would be the U.S. attorney 
there, clearly is well qualified for that 
position. The same is true in Illinois. 
Our choice, Senator DUCKWORTH’s 
and my choice for the U.S. marshal to 
serve in the Northern District of Illi-
nois, is an individual with 30 years—30 
years—of law enforcement experience, 
a chief of police in one of the larger 
suburbs in the city of Chicago. 
Do we need the U.S. Marshal’s Office 
to be reinvigorated and dedicated to its 
purpose? Of course we do. It wasn’t 
that many years ago when the family 
of one of our highly respected Federal 
judges was literally murdered in their 
home by a deranged individual who 
didn’t care for the way he was treated 
by that judge. It is a very real question 
of personal safety. Yet one Republican 
Senator from Arkansas is stopping the 
appointments of these U.S. attorneys 
and U.S. marshals to execute the laws 
of the land. 
Don’t tell me you respect law en-
forcement, and don’t tell me you want 
to fight crime and then turn around 
and tie the hands of the Department of 
Justice, keeping U.S. attorneys off the 
job and U.S. marshals away from their 
responsibilities. That is the reality. 
If we are going to get serious about 
fighting 
crime—and 
I 
believe 
we 
should—it is all hands on deck. Every 
Federal 
law 
enforcement 
official 
should be doing their part. They can-
not do their part when the junior Sen-
ator from Arkansas stops us from even 
approving their appointments to these 
positions. These appointments remain 
vacant, and we pay a price for it. 
When we receive lectures from the 
minority leader or from others on the 
floor about respect for law and law en-
forcement, I would say he ought to 
start with his own caucus. He ought to 
call in the junior Senator from Arkan-
sas and say: Enough. You are stepping 
on our message. We are trying to show 
that we are for law and order, and you 
are stopping the appointment of U.S. 
attorneys and U.S. marshals who are 
dedicated to that purpose and risk 
their lives to do so. 
That is not consistent with good law 
enforcement or sound law and order as 
far as I am concerned. 
(Mr. BOOKER assumed the Chair.) 
Let me conclude by saying that the 
nominees who come before the Senate 
for these judicial positions are a wide 
variety of individuals with amazing 
backgrounds—incredible 
back-
grounds—and 
who 
are 
consistently 
rated unanimously ‘‘well qualified’’ by 
the American Bar Association. It is 
true that some of them used to sit at 
the other table in the criminal court-
rooms, not at the prosecutor’s table, 
but there is nothing wrong with some 
balance on the court, making sure that 
we have all points of view considered 
and certainly, above all, the law con-
sidered. 
We hear, from time to time, compel-
ling anecdotes, such as the one given 
by the minority leader related to Lou-
isville, KY. I am not familiar with the 
details. But if we are serious about 
making America safer, we need to pull 
together on a bipartisan basis. We need 
to approve President Biden’s budget, 
which provides more resources for law 
enforcement but also more resources 
for violence intervention. 
The Presiding Officer knows person-
ally, as mayor of a large city in New 
Jersey, that we can’t arrest our way 
out of the crime problem in America. 
Certainly, we should pursue law en-
forcement 
measures 
and 
responses 
when necessary and apply the law 
without question, but it takes more 
than that. If we are going to reach into 
the communities around America and 
try to stop this violence before it oc-
curs, then we have to look at other ap-
proaches. 
I am happy to report that last week 
we announced the introduction of the 
Violence Against Women Act. This is a 
measure which, for 3 years, we have 
been trying to find common ground. We 
did it. We finally did it. 
I want to salute Senator FEINSTEIN as 
the lead Democratic sponsor. I was 
happy to join her. 
I also want to salute Senators LISA 
MURKOWSKI and JONI ERNST, from Alas-
ka and Iowa, respectively. They have 
done such extraordinary work in put-
ting together a bill. 
You say to yourself: How does this fit 
in with violence against women, the 
question of crime in America? 
Well, I can tell you—the Presiding 
Officer knows this personally, and it is 
worth repeating—that I went to the ju-
venile facility in Cook County years 
ago and said: Who are these teenagers 
who came to the Earth in the usual 
way and then turned to gangs and guns 
and killing wantonly? What happened 
to these kids along the way? 
Well, there are plenty of reasons and 
issues related to mental health, but 
one of the things that was compelling 
was the observation that over 90 per-
cent of them had been victims of trau-
ma. Trauma comes in many forms, not 
just physical trauma but to witness 
trauma on another person or to be a 
victim yourself, to have a home where 
there is no support, no encouragement, 
and no values being taught. Those kids 
are the ones who end up, many times, 
in these predicaments. 
What can we do about it? 
Well, we can probably arrest them 
after the crime has been committed, 
but that really doesn’t solve the prob-
lem. We have got to do what we can to 
intervene in their lives at a stage when 
they can be saved. I don’t believe that

February 17, 2022 
everyone can be saved, but I do fun-
damentally believe in redemption and 
in our responsibility to engage in it. 
That is why this Violence Against 
Women Act is so important. If we can 
reach into a home where physical or 
mental abuse has taken place of a 
spouse or the children and give that 
person, first, a caring heart—someone 
who will listen and hear them out—and 
then advise them on what to do to keep 
themselves safe and keep their kids 
safe and what to do in relation to law 
enforcement, that is a positive move 
toward taking violence out of that 
family and out of America. 
So I hope that when we talk about 
this whole issue of a safer America, 
which we all aspire to, we do it in a 
balanced way; that we talk about effec-
tive prosecution by members of law en-
forcement who are playing by the rules 
and that we also realize it takes more 
than that. We need an investment in 
the communities to make a difference. 
President Biden knows that. He in-
cluded it in this year’s budget and will 
again in next year’s budget. We ought 
to be standing up and supporting that 
as well. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AGRICULTURE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, farming 
and ranching are the lifeblood of my 
home State and a way of life for many 
South Dakotans, and advocating for 
farmers and ranchers is one of my top 
priorities here in Congress. 
As a longtime member of the Sen-
ate’s Agriculture Committee, I have 
been able to help shape multiple farm 
bills and make sure that South Dako-
ta’s agriculture producers’ voices are 
heard here in Washington. 
Lately, I have been hearing a lot of 
reports from South Dakota’s producers 
and ag exporters about ocean carriers 
refusing to transport American agri-
cultural products. This is, obviously, a 
major concern for farmers and ranch-
ers, who are already struggling with 
the burden of inflation and high input 
costs and who rely on exports for part 
of their livelihoods, which is why I re-
cently introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion to address violations of free and 
fair competition in shipping and to cre-
ate a more level playing field for Amer-
ican producers. 
Our bill gives the Federal Maritime 
Commission greater authority to re-
spond to discriminatory ocean carrier 
practices, and it provides the FMC with 
the tools to more quickly resolve de-
tention and demurrage disputes. 
This legislation will bring greater ef-
ficiency and transparency to a process 
that leaves many shippers frustrated 
and 
will 
bring 
long-term 
positive 
changes to the maritime supply chain, 
which, I hope, will benefit ag exporters, 
importers, and consumers alike. 
Another one of my priorities lately 
has been to address the Biden adminis-
tration’s proposed Waters of the United 
States, or WOTUS, rule. WOTUS con-
cerns which water features are regu-
lated at the Federal level. 
Now, generally, the Clean Water Act 
only calls for navigable waters to be 
regulated at the Federal level, which 
are things like rivers and streams that 
connect to larger bodies of water. But, 
like 
President 
Obama 
before 
him, 
President Biden is trying to expand 
Federal jurisdiction to regulate things 
like ditches, prairie potholes, and 
streams that only flow when it rains. 
Needless to say, this would subject 
nearly every corner of South Dakota to 
this DC land grab. 
Farmers and ranchers could be sub-
jected to the time-consuming process 
of having each and every pothole and 
ditch examined by Federal regulators, 
and they could face massive fines 
should they run afoul of DC regulators 
looking to halt everyday farming and 
ranching practices. Those fines can be 
$25,000 a day. That is not acceptable. 
Any WOTUS rule that is going to 
work for farmers and ranchers has to 
include categorical exclusions for fea-
tures like ditches, prairie potholes, and 
stock ponds, which is why I recently 
led the entire Senate Republican con-
ference in writing to the EPA and the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regard-
ing the Biden administration’s pro-
posed WOTUS rule. We urged the ad-
ministration to suspend its WOTUS 
rulemaking until the Supreme Court 
rules on the Clean Water Act case it is 
currently considering, which would ef-
fectively invalidate the Biden WOTUS 
regulations. 
Implementing the WOTUS rule now, 
when it could be overturned in the near 
future, would subject farmers and 
ranchers to an unacceptable level of 
uncertainty as they plan for the up-
coming planting season. It is very like-
ly that the Supreme Court will force 
the administration to go back to the 
drawing board, which would, hopefully, 
result in a less intrusive and more 
workable rule that won’t subject farm-
ers and ranchers to even more Wash-
ington redtape. 
As a supporter of South Dakota and 
our Nation’s corn and soybean farm-
ers—and as a supporter of clean en-
ergy—I have long championed the 
clean energy potential of biofuels. The 
EPA’s renewable fuel standard, which 
requires that a minimum volume of re-
newable fuel be sold in the United 
States each year, is a significant tool 
for reducing the carbon footprint of our 
transportation sector. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion has shown a willingness to under-
mine the blending targets set by the 
renewable fuel standard, going as far as 
a proposal to retroactively reduce the 
2020 
renewable 
volume 
obligation, 
which had already been finalized. 
The Biden EPA tried to suggest that 
these cuts would be made up for with 
higher 2022 blending targets, but with a 
new precedent, there would be nothing 
to stop the administration from again 
caving to oil refiners and retroactively 
reducing volume obligations in the fu-
ture. 
That is why I recently joined a bipar-
tisan group of my colleagues in urging 
the EPA to prioritize the renewable 
fuel standard by maintaining the in-
creased blending requirements for 2022, 
denying all pending small refinery ex-
emptions, eliminating proposed retro-
active cuts to the 2020 renewable vol-
ume obligations, and setting 2021 re-
newable fuel standard volumes at the 
statutory levels. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
administration 
remains almost singularly focused on 
electric vehicles rather than on the 
readily available and proven clean en-
ergy contributions of biofuels. Ethanol, 
biodiesel, and now sustainable aviation 
fuel can drive down emissions and help 
reduce our demand for oil—an impor-
tant consideration given soaring gas 
prices and the fact that this adminis-
tration is forcing us to rely more on 
foreign oil production. 
Now, currently, some of my col-
leagues are promoting a report that 
was conveniently issued right before 
yesterday’s EPW Committee hearing 
on the renewable fuel standard. My col-
leagues, who rarely pass on an oppor-
tunity to malign biofuels, say the re-
port undercuts the growing body of re-
search that says biofuels cut emissions 
by as much as 46 percent or more com-
pared to gasoline. 
To this, I will say that if you are con-
cerned about accurate accounting of 
biofuel emissions, I invite you to co-
sponsor my bill, the bipartisan Adopt 
GREET Act. This bill would require 
the EPA to update its greenhouse gas 
modeling for ethanol and biodiesel by 
using the Department of Energy’s 
GREET model. Let’s put energy tech-
nologies head-to-head. I call on the 
chairman of the Environment and Pub-
lic Works Committee to mark up my 
bipartisan bill. 
Biofuels also provide a highly impor-
tant market for corn and soybean 
farmers whose crops and their byprod-
ucts go into biofuel production. And it 
is incredibly unfortunate that the ad-
ministration continues to overlook the 
clean energy potential of biofuels and 
the associated benefits for our Nation’s 
farmers. 
I sent two letters to President Biden 
with a number of my colleagues seek-
ing a meeting to discuss all the ways 
biofuels could complement his agenda 
and noting the bipartisan support for 
ethanol and biodiesel. Unfortunately, 
it quickly became clear that the Presi-
dent and his administration had little 
interest in the proven clean energy po-
tential of biofuels. But I will continue 
to do everything I can here in Wash-
ington to promote this clean energy re-
source and to expand opportunities for 
South Dakota producers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S761 
February 17, 2022 
No matter the season, South Dakota 
farmers and ranchers will always be 
one of my top priorities here in Wash-
ington. I continue to work to help 
farmers and ranchers deal with the 
challenges of inflation, which are hit-
ting our farm communities hard, and I 
continue to press the administration to 
ensure that the meatpacking industry 
is held accountable for any unfair prac-
tices. 
Whatever the challenges—and in the 
farming life, there are always many— 
our Nation’s farmers and ranchers keep 
pushing forward to feed our Nation and 
the world, and I will continue to do all 
that I can to ensure that they have the 
resources that they need to carry out 
that mission. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I want 
to begin my remarks today with a few 
words to specifically urge American 
seniors and the immunocompromised 
to continue to protect themselves 
against COVID–19 by ensuring that you 
are fully vaccinated, including a boost-
er shot and by wearing a high-quality 
mask. 
As States around the country begin 
to unwind mask and vaccine mandates, 
I implore America’s seniors to remain 
vigilant against this virus. First, get 
boosted. The vaccine is the most pow-
erful tool we have to protect yourself 
against COVID–19 infection. We know 
that the vaccine continues to be highly 
effective at preventing serious illness 
and death from COVID–19, but we also 
know that thousands of Americans 
have died from breakthrough cases of 
COVID–19, and the vast majority are 
over the age of 60. 
In Massachusetts alone, 2,200 vac-
cinated 
individuals 
have 
died 
of 
COVID–19, and more than 93 percent of 
those deaths were over the age of 60. 
We are 2 percent of America’s popu-
lation. So you can multiply that 2,000 
to get an idea as to what has happened 
with people who are ‘‘fully vaccinated’’ 
but who are older and who still con-
tract the coronavirus. 
So we have to just make sure that 
everyone gets this message straight. 
For many Americans, they are going to 
be told: You don’t have to wear masks. 
But for many others there has to be a 
strong message: You should continue 
to wear your mask to protect yourself. 
And although I have called upon the 
CDC to track and share this data about 
the deaths over the age of 60, they just 
haven’t done so. So if we extrapolate 
the Massachusetts number, there may 
very well have been already over 100,000 
Americans—overwhelmingly, seniors— 
who have died, despite the fact that 
they have received two shots of the 
vaccine. So let’s just make sure that 
we deliver that message correctly. 
Keep your mask on. 
This is a very good mask. There are 
KF94s. We have a very good N95 mask 
here that is absolutely certified by 
NIOSH. But many of these other masks 
that people are wearing just aren’t 
going to give you the protection, which 
you need, so we need a strong message 
that goes out to seniors especially but 
to anyone who is immunocompromised 
and to children who have not been vac-
cinated. When this ‘‘You can take off 
your mask’’ era begins, let’s just un-
derstand that there are going to be 
very many vulnerable people out there. 
So from my perspective, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention has 
also reported that the unvaccinated 
seniors were 90 times more likely to die 
of COVID–19 than those who received 
the vaccine booster. But I will say it 
again: If you haven’t already, get vac-
cinated and get a booster. 
An average of 2,300 people died from 
COVID nationwide in the past week per 
day—overwhelmingly, people over the 
age of 60—and each death is a tragedy 
for their families or their commu-
nities. They are our grandmothers, our 
grandfathers, our parents, our veterans 
who fought for democracy. They are ir-
replaceable members of our lives, and 
we have already lost too many to 
COVID–19. 
But we have a powerful way to help, 
and that is to wear a mask. Again, if 
you put on these masks—here is a 
KF94—this will give you most of the 
protection you need. But please do not 
take it off because everyone else is in-
doors now saying the mask mandate 
indoors is off—not if you are in this 
vulnerable category. It should not be. 
Understand that the risk is still there. 
Here is the second point. I am urging 
you to continue to protect yourself, 
wear a high-quality mask. The CDC up-
dated in January its masking guidance 
to recommend that the general public 
and especially seniors and those who 
are immunocompromised use higher 
quality masks, like the N95s, the 
KF94s, and the KN95s. We are seeing 
welcome decreases in rates of new in-
fections right now, but these popu-
lations are still the most vulnerable to 
COVID. Just because younger people 
may be using their masks less, it does 
not mean that those at higher risk 
should stop being vigilant. Continue to 
use a high-quality mask to protect 
yourself when you are indoors and 
around others. 
Getting a high-quality mask should 
be an easy thing to do, but with less- 
than-robust 
information, 
sometimes 
limited supplies, and a lot of counter-
feits abounding, it has been harder 
than it should be for consumers to stay 
educated and protected. That is why I 
am pleased to see the Biden adminis-
tration distribute 400 million nonsur-
gical N95 masks from the Strategic Na-
tional Stockpile to the public. The 
masks are available at retail phar-
macies and community health centers, 
so go get one. Ask a friend or a family 
member to bring one to you. 
Make sure you are wearing a protec-
tive mask. Understand that surgical 
masks give you less protection. A cloth 
mask gives you much less protection. 
Just understand that, especially if you 
are in a vulnerable category. 
I want to say this over and over 
again. If you are over 60, you are in 
that category, so just protect yourself. 
That small item can be what it is that 
protects you and your family members. 
Just make sure the masks we use are 
the best, the most accessible, the most 
affordable, and the most reliable that 
they can be. It is not always conven-
ient, but we need to continue to pro-
tect ourselves. I urge those Americans 
over the age of 60 and those who are 
immunocompromised to continue to 
mask up. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, now I would just like 
to move on quickly to a different topic. 
As we watch President Putin amass 
tens of thousands of soldiers on the 
border of Ukraine, we must confront 
the fuel that powers this show of mili-
tary might—specifically, fossil fuels. 
Our global addiction to oil and nat-
ural gas from Russia and from Saudi 
Arabia keeps us locked into dangerous 
cycles of conflict and corruption, but 
we have a way out. We can build a 
pathway to a more prosperous future, a 
more peaceful future. We can build cit-
ies powered by cheap, clean electricity, 
build all-electric vehicles for our roads, 
and build homes that are healthier and 
more energy efficient than ever before. 
By putting 25 million new electric ve-
hicles on our roads, we can stop all oil 
imports from Russia and Saudi Arabia 
into the United States of America. 
That is 25 million all-electric vehicles. 
That is a direct message to the busi-
ness model of Russia and of Saudi Ara-
bia. That is the U.S. Congress passing 
legislation that propels the all-electric 
vehicle revolution here and sets a 
model for the rest of the country. 
But rather than invest in that clean, 
affordable, healthy future, our country 
and the global economy are being held 
hostage by the American Petroleum In-
stitute and their Big Oil buddies. Rath-
er than supporting energy policies that 
secure our independence and our fu-
ture, Big Oil pushes policies that se-
cure their profit margins. At the same 
time that we get crocodile tears from 
Republicans over American fossil fuel 
leases, those same leases are feeding 
the American Petroleum Institute and 
not the United States of America. 
In 2021, we exported one out of every 
four barrels of oil we produced, and we 
are exporting them abroad because in 
2015, the Republicans voted to end the 
decades-long oil export ban in the 
United States. It was the Republican 
votes that put company profits over 
consumer protections and climate poli-
cies. So our energy prices rose at home 
while we were left to deal with the

health and climate crisis created in 
this rush to export and profit. At the 
same time, we continued to import 
Russian and Saudi oil. That is what we 
are doing right now—propping up those 
regimes and supporting their financial 
reserves. 
The journey to energy independence 
simply does not run on fossil fuels. 
How does it run? It runs on solar; on 
wind; on battery storage; on clean, 
zero-carbon energy; on a clean energy 
future for our country. We can re-
imagine a future that is free from fossil 
fuel conflict. We can reimagine a fu-
ture powered by the light of the Sun, 
not by oil controlled by the barrel of a 
gun. We can tell Russia we don’t need 
their oil any more than we need their 
caviar. That is a message we can send 
by passing legislation that unleashes 
this clean energy revolution. We can 
reimagine a future where American in-
genuity, manufacturing, and jobs drive 
our allies forward into a global clean 
energy revolution. 
This future isn’t far off beyond the 
horizon. It is right in front of us, and it 
is already putting Americans to work 
and keeping lights on across this coun-
try. 
In 2010, we had 1 million jobs in solar, 
wind, and energy efficiency. By 2020, 
that more than doubled to more than 2 
million jobs. Now we have all of those 
millions of workers out there, and we 
can double it again and double it again. 
We can create millions of new clean en-
ergy jobs for millions of Americans 
across this country. 
In 2008, we only had 26,000 megawatts 
of solar. Today, we have upwards of 
264,000 megawatts of solar and wind ca-
pacity combined on our grid. 
The electric vehicle revolution is al-
ready on its way. Automakers are 
pledging to produce 40 million new 
electric vehicles just in the United 
States. That is 2 million barrels of oil 
that are out of our system forever that 
we don’t need. That is the oil from 
Russia that we import today. That is 
the oil we import today from Saudi 
Arabia. That is what we have to do in 
our country. To put that in context, 
just 10 years ago, there were only 73,000 
electric vehicles sold all year in the 
United States. 
We can do this. Our opportunity is 
great. We have a chance to use the 
Build Back Better bill to send a mes-
sage: We are going to save money, save 
energy, save industrial communities, 
save all of us from a world made unsta-
ble through fossil fuel creating crisis 
after crisis on this planet. 
This is the power of the American-led 
clean energy revolution. Looking at 
the alternative, with troops paid by 
fossil fuel money on the border of 
Ukraine, I know what kind of future I 
want and I think the American people 
want to fight for. 
We have to destroy the business 
model of Russia and Middle Eastern 
countries that have been sources of 
problems for American national secu-
rity for more than a generation. That 
is the opportunity we are all presented 
with right now. That is why Build Back 
Better—that is why President Biden’s 
vision of wind and solar, all-electric ve-
hicles, 
battery-storage 
technologies, 
and clean energy technologies by the 
millions being deployed in our country, 
will create millions of new jobs, reduce 
greenhouse gases, and improve our na-
tional security. 
This is the healthcare, the environ-
mental, the national security, and the 
moral issue of our time. If we haven’t 
learned another lesson from Ukraine, it 
should be that the time is now for us to 
act so that 10 years from now, the next 
generation of young Americans can 
look back and say we did act, we did 
destroy that business model. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Alabama. 
TRIBUTE TO SHANNON HINES 
Mr. SHELBY. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. You are being very kind today. 
Today, I rise to pay tribute to a long-
time, vital member of my staff, Shan-
non Hines. There aren’t many in the 
Senate who don’t know Shannon or 
know of Shannon. Her sterling reputa-
tion precedes her, as it should. 
Shannon has been one of the most 
valuable members of my staff through-
out my career. Those who know her are 
aware of her resounding work ethic, 
having spent countless late nights 
right here in the Senate and long week-
ends at the office. Not only has she 
been a trusted asset to me, but she has 
proved to be essential in our work here 
in the Senate to fund the government 
and our Nation’s defense during my 
time in leadership on the Appropria-
tions Committee. 
Having grown up in North Carolina, 
Shannon is a proud graduate of Wake 
Forest University. She began her ca-
reer on Capitol Hill as a staff assistant 
to 
freshman 
Representative 
Fred 
Heineman of North Carolina and then 
worked as a legislative assistant to 
Representative Lamar Smith of Texas. 
I first met Shannon in 1999 when she 
applied for a job in the Senate with my 
staff. She joined my staff after experi-
ence in the House as a legislative as-
sistant. 
Shannon has served in many impor-
tant roles on my senior staff, including 
my legislative director, which is a very 
important post, as the Presiding Offi-
cer knows; as chief of staff, which is an 
even more important post; senior pol-
icy adviser for the Senate Banking 
Committee when I was chairman of the 
Banking Committee; staff director of 
the Senate Rules Committee when I 
was chairman of the Rules Committee; 
and staff director of the Senate Appro-
priations Committee and its Defense 
Subcommittee. 
Notably, she is, as you would know, 
the first female staff director for the 
full 
Senate 
Appropriations 
Com-
mittee—first female staff director of 
the 
Senate 
Appropriations 
Com-
mittee—something she was humbly un-
aware of until it was mentioned by a 
former colleague. 
When I first took over as chairman of 
the Senate Appropriations Committee 
a number of years back, Shannon was 
able to lead the committee in moving 
the most appropriations bills, with the 
help of everybody in the Senate, in 22 
years in a bipartisan way. By the end 
of the fiscal year, 75 percent of the gov-
ernment was funded on time and 
through an open, bipartisan way. The 
Presiding Officer will remember; he 
was part of that. 
Shannon’s 27 years of service on Cap-
itol Hill deserve the utmost recogni-
tion and praise, not just by me but I 
think a lot of us. She has earned my re-
spect and the respect of countless oth-
ers. I admire her for her valued com-
mitment to her work and unending de-
termination to get the job done. 
Although I am sad to see her go, I re-
main grateful for her diligence, hard 
work, and guidance over the years. I 
wish Shannon all the best as she pre-
pares for a new phase in her remark-
able career in the private sector. 
I can say without question that I 
would not have been able to accomplish 
what we have been able to do on the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
without 
her. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CHINA 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
since coming to the U.S. Senate over 3 
years ago, I have regularly spoken 
about the dangers presented by com-
munist China. 
Last month, outside the Kennedy 
Caucus Room, I was joined by a group 
of pro-democracy activists from Hong 
Kong 
and 
advocates 
speaking 
out 
against the genocide in the Uighur 
homeland. 
This month, as the Olympic Games 
have gone on in Beijing, we have seen 
the dangers that our athletes have 
faced. Athletes who have tested posi-
tive for COVID have been taken away 
by Chinese authorities, where they 
have been improperly fed. The FBI 
urged Team USA to leave their per-
sonal phones at home for fear of being 
surveilled by the Chinese Government 
and impacted by Chinese hackers. 
Of course, we saw the dangers ath-
letes face in communist China several 
months ago in the case of tennis star 
Peng Shuai. Peng is one of the most 
recognizable Chinese athletes. She is a 
three-time Olympian and was ranked 
the No. 1 doubles player in 2014 by the 
World Women’s Tennis Association. 
She 
has 
won 
championships 
at 
Wimbledon and the French Open and 
has represented her country at the 
highest levels of tennis competition.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S763 
February 17, 2022 
In November, when she shared her 
story of sexual abuse by a former Vice 
Premier of the Chinese Communist 
Party on social media, it rightfully 
caught the world’s attention. Com-
munist China’s reaction to these dis-
turbing allegations have shocked us all 
and completely verified all our fears. 
Instead 
of 
taking 
Peng 
Shuai’s 
claims 
seriously 
and 
investigating 
these allegations, the communist Chi-
nese Government followed its authori-
tarian playbook: silence, deflect, and 
cover up. General Secretary Xi and his 
communist thugs are so thin-skinned, 
weak, and intolerant of any ques-
tioning of their conduct that the gov-
ernment immediately silenced and dis-
appeared Peng. 
People around the world asked on so-
cial media: ‘‘Where is Peng?’’ Chinese 
state media released what it said was 
an email from Peng to the Women’s 
Tennis Association contradicting her 
previous allegations. It read like a hos-
tage note and only raised more con-
cerns as to her whereabouts and safety. 
Then Beijing shared a couple of videos 
of Peng at various structured public 
events and staged several video calls 
with the International Olympic Com-
mittee. The IOC didn’t ask about her 
disappearance; they didn’t ask about 
her allegations of abuse. And in the 
months since, the IOC has worked 
hand-in-hand with communist China to 
cover up Peng’s allegations. 
In the days after the Olympic open-
ing ceremony, the IOC worked with 
Chinese officials to publish a highly 
controlled interview of Peng in a 
French sports magazine. In answers 
that were translated by a Chinese offi-
cial, Peng announced her retirement 
from professional tennis and denied the 
previous claim she was assaulted. It 
was disturbing. And the fact that the 
IOC helped coordinate the interview 
shows Thomas Bach is willing to 
prioritize his relationship with com-
munist China over the safety of ath-
letes. 
Compare their response to the World 
Tennis Association. At the beginning 
of December, the WTA announced it 
would be suspending all its tour-
naments in communist China until it 
was clear that Peng Shuai was safe and 
in good health and until there was a 
completely transparent investigation 
into her allegations of assault. It is a 
stark contrast between two organiza-
tions meant to protect the athletes— 
one aiding in the censorship and op-
pression of athletes, while the other 
does the right thing. 
And now, you have a well-known 
pundit representing the Chinese Com-
munist Party spouting gross and de-
meaning comments about Peng. On ‘‘60 
Minutes Australia,’’ Victor Gao, the 
vice president for the Center for China 
and Globalization and former trans-
lator for Deng Xiaoping, argued Peng 
could not have been assaulted because 
she is strong and athletic, so she 
should be able to defend herself. Can 
you imagine even saying that? The 
Chinese Communist Party is saying 
that there is no way Peng could have 
been assaulted, so you better stop talk-
ing about this issue. 
Well, I am not going to stop talking 
about this issue, and I am not going to 
let comments like that slide by. That 
is why I have introduced a bipartisan 
resolution with my colleague from Vir-
ginia rebuking the IOC for its failure to 
clearly and forcefully challenge the 
Party’s claims about Peng Shuai’s 
safety. The same resolution was unani-
mously adopted by the House of Rep-
resentatives in December, and it is cru-
cial that the Senate do the same. 
My colleague from Virginia, Senator 
WARNER, is joining me to lead this res-
olution, along with 14 of our colleagues 
from both sides of the aisle. I am glad 
that my colleague from New Jersey, 
the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, has committed 
to mark up and favorably report this 
important resolution in the committee 
next month. I look forward to seeing 
its passage there and swiftly bringing 
it to the floor. 
The United States is the leading 
voice of freedom and democracy around 
the world. We cannot tolerate this kind 
of behavior. Today, my colleagues and 
I are standing together for human 
rights. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CALENDAR 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate proceed 
to executive session and consider the

endar No. 599 and Calendar No. 693;

lated to the nominations be printed in 
the RECORD; that the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tion and the Senate resume legislative 
session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ob-
ject, and will submit a statement for 
the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. KING. Senator, are you up for a 
question? Will the Senator yield for a 
question? 
Mr. President, I would like to direct 
a question through the Chair to the 
Senator from Indiana and ask the rea-
son for his objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator from Missouri yield? 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, do I get a 
response from the Senator from Indi-
ana? 
Mr. President, we have two qualified 
nominees, reported out on a bipartisan 
basis by the Armed Services Com-
mittee at a moment of heightened 
international tension. 
The Senator from Missouri—I said 
Indiana—I say the Senator from Mis-
souri objected with no reason whatso-
ever. I asked him for his reasoning, and 
he did not respond; he walked out of 
the room. 
I don’t understand such an irrespon-
sible action. This is a matter of na-
tional security. We have no reason for 
this objection. I understand that he is 
objecting to all nominees at the De-
partment of Defense because he is 
upset about accountability for the 
withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
We have taken action to deal with 
that question. In the National Defense 
Authorization Act that we just passed, 
there was a Commission created ex-
pressly to examine the issue of Afghan-
istan—how we got in, why we got in, 
what we did, how we left—on a bipar-
tisan basis. I believe that was reported 
out by the committee unanimously in 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act after the committee’s markup. So 
that is accountability. 
In addition, the Armed Services and 
Intelligence Committees, which I also 
serve on, had at least 10—I think it was 
more like a dozen—hearings on the 
withdrawal from Afghanistan in the 
latter part of 2021, before the end of the 
year—a dozen hearings. 
I was going to ask the Senator from 
Missouri how many hearings were held 
when he was a member of the Armed 
Services Committee and his party was 
in charge of the committee, how many 
hearings 
were 
held 
on 
President 
Trump’s agreement to leave Afghani-
stan in Doha in February of 2020. That 
was the decision that led to President 
Biden effectuating the treaty—not the 
treaty but the agreement that the 
Trump administration had made with 
the Taliban that led to the evacuation 
of Americans and American troops 
from Afghanistan. 
You know how many hearings were 
held by the Armed Services Committee 
on the Doha agreement, which was ef-
fectively guaranteeing we would leave 
Afghanistan with some minor condi-
tions? Zero. Zero. Talk about account-
ability. There were no hearings or dis-
cussion in the committee that I can re-
call of the Doha agreement, where the 
Trump administration agreed with the 
Taliban that we would leave by May 1 
of 2021, as long as the Taliban didn’t at-
tack our troops. 
And now the Senator from Missouri 
is holding up nominees because of 
some—he doesn’t like the way the 
evacuation occurred or he wants more 
questions from the Secretary of De-
fense. 
We had hearings over and over. And 
what is going on here is a compromise

of national security because the Sen-
ator from Missouri has questions that, 
I guess, haven’t been answered, al-
though I believe he was at those hear-
ings, had the opportunity to examine 
and cross-examine the Secretary of De-
fense and other officials of the Biden 
administration. 
But here we are, at a moment of na-
tional tension—and that is putting it 
mildly—with nominees who are in 
charge of space and readiness. The Sen-
ator from Missouri today blocked con-
sideration and confirmation of an As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Readi-
ness and for Space, two areas of crit-
ical national concern, for reasons that 
he wouldn’t say. He walked out of the 
room. He walked out of the room. That 
is not accountability. 
If you are going to do something that 
endangers national defense and block 
nominees who have been reported out 
by the committee on a bipartisan basis, 
accountability is standing in this room 
and telling the American people why 
he is doing it. Accountability means 
being responsible for your actions, not 
saying ‘‘I object’’ and then walking 
out, and that is what happened just 
now on this floor. I have never seen 
anything like it. 
These are well-qualified nominations, 
reported out by the committee on a bi-
partisan basis, and we need them in 
these jobs. We need them now, today, 
in these jobs, and now that is not going 
to be possible because one Senator, for 
reasons that he refused to explain or 
expand upon, objected. That is not re-
sponsible. That is not responsible. That 
is endangering national security. 
And to do so without any explanation 
is just, I believe, not appropriate for a 
Member of this body. 
So we will renew these requests at a 
later date and hope that the Senator 
will have thought better of this action 
and allow these nominations to go for-
ward as requested by a bipartisan ma-
jority of the Armed Services Com-
mittee. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, it is 
now February. It has been nearly 6 
months since the disastrous with-
drawal from Afghanistan. 
Thirteen servicemembers lost their 
lives in the attack on Abbey Gate, 
along with hundreds of civilians. As a 
result of the botched evacuation oper-
ation, hundreds, if not thousands, of 
American civilians were left behind to 
the enemy. 
We hear from our friends on the 
other side of the aisle that my insist-
ence that we actually vote on nominees 
is unprecedented. I would humbly sug-
gest that the crisis into which this 
President has led this country is un-
precedented. In my lifetime, it is un-
precedented. 
And who has been held accountable 
for this disaster? No one. Who has the 
President fired? Who has offered their 
resignation? Which of the planners at 
the Department of State or the Depart-
ment of Defense or the National Secu-
rity Council have been relieved of 
duty? No one. 
Until there is accountability, I am 
going to ask that the Senate do the 
simple task of its job, which is to actu-
ally vote on these nominees. The least 
we could do is observe regular order 
and vote on these leadership positions 
at the Department of State and at the 
Department of Defense. 
My colleagues say that we have got 
to put national security first. I agree 
with them about that. But I believe 
that begins at the top, with the Presi-
dent of the United States and the lead-
ership of the Department of Defense 
and the Department of State. I, for 
one, am not going to stand by and look 
the other way while this administra-
tion systematically endangers our na-
tional security, imperils the American 
people, and watches the sacrifice of our 
soldiers go by without any account-
ability, without any change in direc-
tion. 
Accountability for the Afghanistan 
disaster is all the more urgent given 
new revelations from the U.S. Central 
Command investigation of the Abbey 
Gate bombing. The investigative report 
makes clear that the administration 
had ample warning prior to mid-August 
that Kabul could collapse rapidly in 
the face of the Taliban’s offensive. It 
shows further how the administration 
refused to acknowledge those warnings 
and act in a timely manner to prepare 
for Kabul’s fall. And it shows in as-
tounding detail just how chaotic the 
final evacuation effort was, with U.S. 
servicemembers 
often 
left 
without 
clear guidance, the State Department 
constantly missing in action, and the 
administration itself intent only on 
evacuating as many people as possible, 
regardless of whether those individuals 
were eligible for evacuation or might 
pose a threat to America’s own secu-
rity. 
I am not willing to look the other 
way and just pretend that Afghanistan 
didn’t happen, which seems to be the 
posture that many in this body have 
adopted. I am not willing to do that. I 
can’t do that because I promised the 
parents of the fallen that I wouldn’t do 
that. 
I am going to discharge my responsi-
bility. And as long as it takes, I will 
continue to draw attention to what 
happened at Abbey Gate and to demand 
accountability for the disaster that 
this administration has pushed upon 
this country and upon the people of my 
State. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
H.R. 6617 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I had just 
spoken about this, but it is imperative 
that we take up and pass H.R. 6617; 
that is the Further Additional Extend-
ing 
Government 
Funding 
Act. 
Of 
course, we call it the CR. 
I say this because the bill will keep 
the Federal Government funded and 
fully operating through March 11, 
while we work out and are working out 
the details of full-year appropriations 
bills to meet the needs of the American 
people. 
And I want to compliment the Appro-
priations Committee staff who have 
been meeting with me and others week-
ends, evenings, for weeks and months 
now, actually, to get this done. 
In a few moments we will vote to in-
voke cloture on the motion to proceed 
to the continuing resolution. As chair-
man of the Appropriations Committee, 
I strongly urge all Members, Repub-
licans and Democrats alike, to vote 
aye. 
A government shutdown would be 
useless, senseless. Imagine how that 
would look to the Russians? 
I am pleased to report that last week 
the four corners of the Senate House 
Appropriations Committee reached a 
framework agreement that will allow 
us to negotiate an omnibus appropria-
tions bill. And that framework was the 
result of weeks of careful negotiations 
between 
myself, 
Vice 
Chairman 
SHELBY, Chair DELAURO and Ranking 
Member GRANGER, and I want to thank 
them. I especially want to thank all 
their staffs who worked late nights and 
weekends that it took us to get to this 
point. 
I don’t know how many nights I prob-
ably turned in about 11 o’clock at night 
and I still was getting emails from 
them working on this. 
Now, it is like any compromise. I 
have been here 48 years. I know you 
have to work these things out. I don’t 
believe any of us walked away from 
these negotiations with everything we 
wanted. There is still much work to do. 
But on the good part, this framework 
sets the stage for us to make signifi-
cant investments to the American peo-
ple and communities across our coun-
try. 
It provides the biggest increase in 
nondefense programs in 4 years. Under 
this framework, we can direct new re-
sources. We can improve healthcare in 
rural communities. We can expand the 
middle class. We can protect our na-
tional security. And we look forward to 
presenting our final agreement to 
Members to review in the coming 
weeks. 
But by passing this continuing reso-
lution, we remove the unnecessary 
threat of yet another government shut-
down and allow the Appropriations 
Committee to continue to work right 
through the upcoming recess. Because 
think of the alternative: a full year 
continuing resolution? That is unten-
able. It is far too onerous on the Amer-
ican people. Our government is not 
meant to run on autopilot; and Amer-
ican taxpayer dollars should not be 
spent on outdated priorities. We have 
the responsibility to make the hard 
choices about how to invest in the 
American people. 
I will give you an example. A full- 
year 
continuing 
resolution 
would 
freeze funding at the National Insti-
tutes of Health. Think what that does. 
Think what that does when it brings

groundbreaking medical research to a 
halt at the time of a pandemic. It 
would once again pass on new invest-
ments that begin to acknowledge the 
climate crisis after 4 years of setting it 
on the back burner. 
The continuing resolution would fail 
to increase investments in the edu-
cation of our Nation’s children or to 
build and renovate affordable housing 
or expand the middle class. 
It would also—and this, people over-
look—it would substantially reduce in-
frastructure spending that was in that 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
law. 
We 
passed this bipartisan infrastructure 
law with an overwhelming vote, but we 
also have to fund it. A full-year, con-
tinuing resolution would lead to delays 
and, frankly, worse, a loss of service to 
veterans. 
To draft the full-year appropriations 
bill allows us to make smart decisions 
on how to invest in each of these areas 
on behalf of the American people. 
In December, the Secretary of De-
fense warned that a full-year CR would 
be unprecedented. It would cause irrep-
arable damage to a wide range of bipar-
tisan priorities from defense mod-
ernization to public health. Well, Sec-
retary Austin is absolutely right. 
A 
full-year 
continuing resolution 
would actually cut defense spending 
below last year’s level. Some programs 
would be underfunded; others would be 
overfunded. And the Department of De-
fense would lack the transfer authority 
to correct the imbalance, yet the worst 
of all possible worlds. 
To give an example, a continuing res-
olution would provide $3.3 billion for 
training and arming the Afghan secu-
rity forces. If anybody has been watch-
ing the press, the Afghan security 
forces aren’t there anymore, but con-
tinuing the resolution would provide 
them $3.3 billion more. Another exam-
ple is the Department of Defense might 
have to lay off some of the men and 
women in the Armed Forces so they 
can afford a 2.7 percent pay raise which 
they rightly deserve that went into ef-
fect last month. So they would say: 
OK. Here is the pay raise, but we have 
to fire you all to pay for it because we 
have a continuing resolution. In other 
words, the continuing resolution would 
be paying to train a military force that 
doesn’t even exist anymore, while lay-
ing off our own troops and civilian 
workforce in order to pay them. 
Well, my talking points say this 
would not make sense. It is actually 
baloney to try to do this. 
Funding the priorities of yesterday 
in the world of today would be irre-
sponsible and is no way to govern. 
Our four-corners framework provides 
a path for reaching a bipartisan, bi-
cameral omnibus agreement by March 
11. Vice Chairman SHELBY, Chairman 
DELAURO
and 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER and I are committed to com-
pleting this work. We and our staffs are 
willing to work straight through until 
that day. So I urge Members to support 
the continuing resolution that passed 
the House with strong bipartisan—Re-
publican and Democrats alike—support 
so we can finish our negotiation. 
And I might say, Mr. President, the 
continuing resolution—and I was here 
at a time when something like this was 
typically passed by a voice vote. But it 
has to pass in its current form. The 
House is out of session. We don’t have 
time for a long and protracted debate. 
The government will shut down at mid-
night tomorrow if we do not sign the 
continuing resolution in its current 
form to the President for his signature. 
So I would urge all Members to op-
pose any amendments—whether they 
come from Republicans or Democrats— 
oppose any amendments to the bill and 
vote yes on the final passage. Be re-
sponsible. If we have to be in tonight 
and tomorrow to finish it, fine. But 
let’s get it done. Come on. 
If you took a poll of the American 
people, 95 percent of them would say: 
What is taking so long? Let’s get it 
done.

UKRAINE 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, in 
November of 2017, I spent some time in 
western Ukraine, sitting down to be 
able to have a meal and be able to talk 
to a group of Oklahomans from the 
45th Infantry of the Oklahoma Na-
tional 
Guard. 
Some 
had 
been 
in 
Ukraine since January of that year, 
and they were still there in November. 
They spent the entire year in 2017—the 
Oklahoma 
National 
Guard—training 
the military of the Ukrainians. Why? 
Because Russians, in 2014, had moved 
into Crimea and had crossed the border 
into the eastern part of Ukraine in 
what is called the Donbas and taken 
over two different areas that—they 
said there were separatists that were 
doing it. They were Russian speakers, 
so they clearly should be under Rus-
sian domination. And they moved in. 
It was an entire year that Oklaho-
mans spent with Ukrainians developing 
friendships, training them, preparing 
them for battle against a very large 
Army in the Russians. They hoped to 
be able to push the Russians out of the 
eastern side of their country. 
And as we sat and visited and talked, 
they told me about the tenacity of the 
Ukrainian fighters, their commitment 
to their families, and their commit-
ment to be able to be independent, to

be a separate functioning democracy, 
to engage with the rest of the world as 
any 
independent 
sovereign 
nation 
would choose to be able to do. That was 
2017. 
To Oklahomans, this conversation 
about Ukraine and the Russians sur-
rounding Ukraine on three sides is not 
theory. Some Oklahomans know the 
names of Ukrainians that are currently 
on those front lines. They served along-
side of each other, and they have 
stayed in contact, calling them friends. 
If you go into the Ukrainian Embassy 
today for the United States, you will 
see a picture of some Oklahomans up 
on the wall because they remember 
that group of Oklahomans that came 
to Ukraine to help them prepare for a 
day they hoped would never come and 
to be able to be ready to push the Rus-
sians out of the eastern part of their 
nation. 
But 
today—literally, 
right 
now— 
Ukrainians living on the border, espe-
cially in the north, can literally hear 
the sound of Russian artillery prac-
ticing just miles away. They have been 
able to hear that sound for days and 
days now as they do live fire exercises 
just on the other side of the border. 
They are seeing that the Russians have 
amassed well in excess of 100,000 troops. 
They gathered troops from Russia from 
the far east next to their border with 
China and had moved them all the way 
to the west to be able to surround 
Ukraine on three sides with naval 
forces and with ground forces. 
They are very aware the Russians 
have moved their special operations. 
They moved in field hospitals. They are 
very aware they are doing live training 
exercises in preparation. They hope 
that it is only saber-rattling, but they 
hear the sound of the guns just a few 
miles away. 
Since hearing from the Russian per-
spective, even within the last 24 hours, 
the Russian diplomats have spoken to 
the BBC just in the last few hours. And 
they spoke and said they have no in-
tention of any aggressive moves, that 
they are a sovereign nation and that 
they can move their forces anywhere 
they want to be able to move on any 
inch of their land, and if they want to 
put their forces all right there along 
the border with Ukraine, that is their 
sovereign right to do that. 
And then they replied back in what 
must be one of the great Russian state-
ments of all time: that the West is not 
reporting that the Ukrainians have 
also moved 100,000 troops next to the 
border with Russia. They must think 
the entire world is delusional. A Rus-
sian diplomat called it ‘‘myth’’ that 
the Russians intend to do aggression 
and said they would only move into 
Ukraine if they were provoked. 
Now, mind you, U.S. intelligence re-
leased publicly just a few days ago a 
plot the Russians had, that they al-
ready created a film—a movie, if I can 
say it that way, a newsreel—that they 
had staged a Ukrainian attack on Rus-
sians, and it laid out actors that 
looked as if they were dead and set up 
all of these Ukrainian implements 
from war and these different vehicles 
surrounding burned-out Russian tanks 
so they could show the world that 
Ukrainians actually attacked them 
first, except our intelligence actually 
exposed that plan. But the Russians are 
still repeating over and over again that 
they will only attack if they are pro-
voked, as they work to be able to stage 
a provocation. 
People forget in the world that when 
the Russians are in Belarus, they are a 
half-day drive from Kyiv, but they are 
also a half-day drive from where they 
are stationed right now from Warsaw. 
This is a tenuous time. This is not a 
new moment for the Russians to act 
aggressively toward their neighbors. In 
2008, Russia invaded the country of 
Georgia. In 2014, as I mentioned, Russia 
annexed Crimea and moved in. In 2014, 
they also moved into the Donbas re-
gion. During that time in 2014, Rus-
sians—in July of 2014, the Russian 53rd 
Anti-Aircraft 
Brigade 
launched 
an 
anti-aircraft weapon against MH17, a 
passenger aircraft flying from Amster-
dam to Malaysia—not even coming to 
Ukraine. They launched an anti-air-
craft weapon against that flight flying 
over Ukraine, and the Russians mur-
dered 298 people because they flew over 
an area that they were working to be 
able to overtake. 
It is clear, the Russians, in their ag-
gression, and Putin, in his attempt to 
make sure the whole world pays atten-
tion to him and shows that he is a pow-
erful man because he can round up the 
entire world to be able to look at him 
when his economy is literally in tat-
ters—Russia’s gross domestic product 
for the entire country is smaller than 
the State of Texas’s gross domestic 
product. Yet, with his nuclear weapons 
and disproportionate allocation to his 
military and his control of oil and gas 
in the region, he continues to be able 
to saber-rattle and force the world to 
be able to look at him, the whole while 
declaring that he is a sovereign and he 
can move troops anywhere he wants to 
move. But also, by the way, Ukraine is 
not sovereign enough to make a deci-
sion about their own defense, demand-
ing that Ukraine never become a mem-
ber of NATO. 
Can I remind the world, NATO is a 
defensive alliance—a defensive alli-
ance. The NATO alliance exists—and it 
is an incredibly successful alliance— 
the NATO alliance exists to be able to 
react if they are attacked. NATO does 
not cooperate in attacking anyone. 
NATO is set up to defend each other 
when attacked. Ukraine is not a NATO 
nation, but NATO nations surround 
Ukraine. And we are all extremely 
aware of Putin’s focus on trying to be 
able to push out and to recreate the 
USSR again. 
We should pay attention. We should 
not pretend this won’t affect the world. 
We have seen oil prices around the 
world already accelerate based on just 
Putin’s actions right now. We have 
seen that he is trying to be able to ma-
nipulate oil prices for the benefit of 
Russia but to the detriment of every-
one else. We can see that. 
The issue is, what are we going to do 
about that? How are we going to actu-
ally engage? Well, our Nation has given 
over $400 million in assistance to 
Ukraine every year since 2014, includ-
ing this year—$464 million in assist-
ance to Ukraine. As I mentioned be-
fore, Oklahomans and multiple others 
have gone to Ukraine and been able to 
train their military for them to be able 
to defend themselves. We have assisted 
the Ukrainian people with counter-
artillery radars, coastal defensive im-
plements, 
geospatial 
intelligence, 
counterunmanned aerial system equip-
ment, electronic warfare, demining 
equipment, small arms—we have tried 
to be able to help the Ukrainians de-
fend themselves. 
We need to also speak with a unified 
voice that if Russia decides they are 
going to move across that border into 
Ukraine, that there are strong, unre-
lenting sanctions coming on that na-
tion and that economy that is smaller 
than the economy of Texas; that we are 
keenly aware of how they survive based 
on oil and gas sales; and we are well- 
prepared to be able to fill in the supply 
from other nations that are buying 
from Russia; that they would be wel-
come to be able to buy from us or from 
any other nation ready to be able to 
sell to them; to be able to supplant 
what Russia is choosing to do; to be 
able to use energy as a leverage point 
on every country in the region to say: 
Don’t respond or we will cut off your 
energy. 
We need to make it very clear that 
the world stands with the free people of 
Ukraine and we will bring severe con-
sequences on the economy of Russia 
that will be long-lasting—not only pri-
mary sanctions, but secondary sanc-
tions. In other words, if individuals 
choose to be able to do business with 
Russia, they have to choose: They can 
either do business with Russia or do 
business with the United States of 
America. You can’t do both. You have 
to pick. 
With the largest economy in the 
world, I believe most would rather 
work with a free market, a free nation, 
than to be able to work with an unsta-
ble Russia. 
But we should be clear. Russia has 
gone back on its words in the Minsk 
Agreement. Russia has gone back on 
its word on multiple different treaty 
agreements. We cannot trust what they 
say, but they should be able to trust 
what we will do if they choose to at-
tack the free people of Ukraine. 
Let me just say this: I firmly believe 
that the best thing that we can do is to 
work to keep a war from ever starting 
rather than engage and try to stop it 
once it starts. We should speak clearly 
as a nation. We should speak clearly 
from the administration. We should 
speak clearly from Congress with a 
unified, nonpartisan voice that the peo-
ple of the United States want to do

what it takes to keep a war from start-
ing so that Europe doesn’t see yet an-
other land war. That is going to take 
focus from this body. 
So what do we need to do? We should 
make the clear offer that we will pro-
vide energy to the rest of the world, 
that if Russia cuts them off, we will 
rapidly move to be able to fill the gap. 
We should make it clear about our pri-
mary and secondary sanctions. We 
should make it clear on diplomatic 
channels and in public what we will do. 
We should continue to be able to work 
with our allies to be able to build a 
strong coalition and to reaffirm the 
NATO alliances there. We should con-
tinue to be able to make it very clear 
to Russia that if they choose to be able 
to move into Ukraine, it would be not 
only 
economically 
disastrous, 
but 
NATO is well prepared to be able to de-
fend our alliance. And we should stand 
with the people of Ukraine and con-
tinue to equip them as they work to be 
able to protect themselves. 
The people of Ukraine, in the times 
that I have been there—and I have been 
there several times—the people of 
Ukraine will be glad to be able to drive 
you through Kyiv and point out the 
places where they fought for their inde-
pendence. They are a proud people. 
They do not want the Russians taking 
over their country. And they have 
fought for their independence once, and 
they are prepared to fight for it again. 
They should know we are prepared to 
stand next to them. 
Let’s pray for the people of Ukraine 
who, right now, hear the guns prac-
ticing on the other side of their border. 
Let’s pray for peace, but let’s also do 
the work to build the groundwork for 
peace, as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The Senator from Wyoming is 
recognized. 
CRIME 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the crime wave that has hit our coun-
try and specifically hit Democratic-run 
cities. Over the last 20 months, Demo-
crats have aided and abetted the most 
dramatic surge in violent crime in 
American history. 
In the summer of 2020, leftwing mobs 
burned cities like Minneapolis and 
Portland, OR. Democratic mayors and 
Governors genuflected to the mob. 
They started a movement to defund the 
police in this country. Bill de Blasio in 
New York cut funding for the New 
York City Police Department by $1 bil-
lion. The Los Angeles City Council 
voted to cut funding by over $150 mil-
lion. 
Nearly two dozen other cities fol-
lowed suit, each of them run by a lib-
eral mayor. What followed was a his-
toric exodus from police departments 
all across the country. Police retire-
ments skyrocketed; resignations in-
creased dramatically among police offi-
cers; and recruitment of new officers 
became almost impossible. 
Thanks to the Democratic politicians 
who have run these cities, our cities 
have fewer police. Our police have 
lower morale, and these communities 
have higher crime. 
In 2020, there was a 30-percent in-
crease in the murder rate nationwide— 
the fastest increase in American his-
tory. 
In 2021, the murder rate went up even 
higher. Sixteen cities broke their all-
time records for homicide, and, of 
course, all 16 were run by liberal Demo-
crats. Of course, these included the cit-
ies that defunded the police. Austin, 
TX, defunded the police, and the mur-
der rate there doubled. 
Last year, the national murder rate 
reached its highest level in 25 years. So 
far, 2022 looks like it may be even 
worse. So what are the Democrats 
doing about it? They have the House, 
they have the Senate, and they have 
the White House. They are doing two 
things: They are making it worse, and 
they are trying to avoid being blamed 
for what they are causing. 
How are they making it worse? Well, 
just take a look at some of the nomi-
nees of President Joe Biden, people he 
has put in high positions in the Justice 
Department—radical 
liberals. 
Every 
Member of the Democrat body in this 
institution voted to confirm them. 
These are people who hold beliefs way 
out of the mainstream of the American 
people when it comes to their service 
for the Department of Justice. Joe 
Biden has essentially handed over Jus-
tice Department leadership to radical 
activists who want to defund the po-
lice. They are the people running the 
Justice Department. Every single Dem-
ocrat voted to confirm them. 
The people of America were shocked 
to learn that last March, Democrats, 
on a straight party-line vote—every 
Republican against; every Democrat 
for—gave almost $1 billion in stimulus 
checks to 645,000 convicted criminals. 
These are people either still behind 
bars or recently released. 
Senator TOM COTTON, the junior Sen-
ator from Arkansas, and I introduced 
an amendment to block them from get-
ting stimulus checks. Every Democrat 
in the Senate voted to block our 
amendment. In effect, they voted to 
subsidize criminals, convicted crimi-
nals. With Democrats in charge in 
America, criminals have hit the jack-
pot. 
The second thing the Democrats are 
trying to do is to try to avoid getting 
blamed for this incredible spike in vio-
lent crime. 
Joe Biden recently went to the ma-
jority leader’s hometown, New York 
City. 
Right now, there is a crimewave in 
New York City, and it is on the rise. 
Crime is up 40 percent in New York 
City so far this year; car thefts are al-
most double. 
Joe Biden went to New York to meet 
with the mayor, Eric Adams. Now, of 
course, Mayor Adams is a former police 
officer and an opponent of the Demo-
crat mantra of defunding the police. So 
Joe Biden was obviously very inter-
ested in engaging and in getting his 
picture taken with the mayor of New 
York so that he could pretend to be 
tough on crime. Voters aren’t buying 
it. The American people know that Joe 
Biden has supported leftwing radicals 
who support defunding the police. 
There was a recent poll in New York. 
New Yorkers were asked if crime is a 
‘‘very serious problem.’’ Three out of 
four New Yorkers say it is. This is the 
most in the 20-year history of taking a 
poll and asking that question. 
So crime is the worst now, in the 
minds of the people who live there in 
New York City, over the last 20 years. 
Two-thirds of all voters say they dis-
approve of Joe Biden on the issue of 
crime. I mean, Biden’s numbers are in 
the tank anyway. Only 40 percent of 
Americans support what he is doing. 
People think the country is heading in 
the wrong direction under Democrat 
leadership in the House and the Senate 
and the White House. But specifically 
in the area of crime, as well as in the 
areas of inflation and the border and 
others, Joe Biden’s numbers drop even 
further. Two-thirds of all Americans 
disapprove of Joe Biden on the issue of 
crime. 
While Joe Biden was in New York, he 
didn’t say a word about the radical new 
district attorney, Alvin Bragg. District 
Attorney Bragg is another radical, left-
wing prosecutor. What does that mean? 
Well, it is interesting, and I will get to 
that in a second. But who would sup-
port this district attorney? Oh, one of 
his top supporters for election was the 
majority leader of the U.S. Senate. 
On District Attorney Bragg’s first 
day in office—first day—he told the 
whole world he would not prosecute 
certain crimes. He didn’t care if they 
were on the books or not, he wasn’t 
going to prosecute them. In other 
words, a district attorney said he sin-
glehandedly was going to legalize cer-
tain crimes in New York City. He told 
every criminal in New York that they 
could commit crimes, not be pros-
ecuted, go home free. These crimes in-
clude trespassing, prostitution, and 
even resisting arrest. 
Imagine being a police officer in New 
York City, where you know people 
aren’t going to be prosecuted for resist-
ing arrest, knowing resisting arrest 
was legal, according to the district at-
torney. It is no wonder so many offi-
cers are quitting, so many have retired, 
and why it is almost impossible to re-
cruit. 
We know what is causing today’s 
Democrat crimewave: too few police, 
too many criminals walking free, and 
too few consequences for the criminals 
in Democrat cities and States. All of 
these are the result of Democrat liberal 
policies. 
These are policies that the American 
people have continued to reject and re-
ject again today. American people 
want the law to be enforced. They want 
prosecutors and judges who follow the

law as written. The American people 
are sick and tired of Democrats cod-
dling criminals. The American people 
support the police. 
It is long past time for the Demo-
crats to reverse course. It is time to re-
verse these reckless Democrat policies 
before this Democrat crimewave gets 
even worse. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the Pre-
siding Officer from Maryland was in 
committee with me today and heard 
the President’s Council of Economic 
Advisers talk about the economy, ac-
knowledging that they spend every day 
worrying about inflation, what we do 
to combat inflation, everything from— 
we see the huge, excess profits in the 
shipping industry, among drug compa-
nies, 
food 
service 
companies—espe-
cially the meatpackers but also super-
market chains and oil companies. A big 
part of inflation we need to combat is 
because these companies understand 
they can raise prices because they 
don’t have much competition. We see 
executive compensation continue to 
rise, sometimes to stratospheric levels. 
Who bears the burden? The burden is 
on middle-class and lower income fami-
lies in places like Baltimore and Cleve-
land and places like western Maryland 
and southeast Ohio. And we know what 
we need to do. 
We also know from our work in this 
committee that the Federal Reserve’s 
job is to make sure that—they are the 
principal group in Washington, in the 
government, to combat inflation, the 
Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve 
has three vacancies and has two other 
nominees who are Acting Federal Re-
serve Governors, and we need to con-
firm them. 
Five nominations came in front of 
our committee last Tuesday—5 nomi-
nations—and because of peculiar Sen-
ate rules, we couldn’t act because all 12 
Republicans boycotted the committee. 
They boycotted the committee because 
one of the nominees from the Presiding 
Officer’s home State, Sarah Bloom 
Raskin, even though she answered 189 
questions—questions in the committee 
and then 189 written questions; major-
ity from Republicans—she answered 
them all in 48 hours. She shouldn’t 
have gotten even more questions. She 
has met with every Senator of either 
party, on the committee or off the 
committee, who wanted to meet with 
her. She has done everything that they 
ask of her. Yet they don’t like her an-
swers. They don’t like that she believes 
the government has to deal with cli-
mate change. They don’t like that she 
is going to stand up to Wall Street. So 
instead of just going to the committee 
and doing their job, voting against her, 
they boycotted the committee so we 
couldn’t vote on the nomination. 
So five jobs, five Governors of the 
Federal Reserve just sit in limbo be-
cause Republicans aren’t doing their 
jobs. You come here, and you vote yes 
or you vote no. You don’t vote ‘‘I am 
not going to show up because I don’t 
like this. I am going to boycott this 
meeting.’’ 
It simply says that Republicans have 
been AWOL in the fight against infla-
tion because we need these Fed Gov-
ernors in place. We need them fighting 
against inflation. And for Republicans 
to just say ‘‘Sorry; we are not going to 
go’’ is simply bailing out and not doing 
their job. They are being AWOL in 
combating inflation. It is wrong for our 
country and wrong for our economy. 
We in the majority put workers at 
the center of our economy, workers at 
the center of our economic policy. We 
will continue to. Republicans need to 
show up and—just show up and do their 
jobs. Vote no if you want, but show up 
and do your jobs. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FREE SPEECH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I was 
surprised to learn that Facebook re-
cently flagged a news article that I 
posted on my Facebook pages as ‘‘false 
information.’’ The article I posted was 
about new Durham investigation alle-
gations against Hillary Clinton’s cam-
paign and its associates. The article 
clearly cited a Federal court filing and 
a former congressional investigator 
with a deep understanding of the 
Democrats’ work to concoct the bogus 
Russia collusion narrative that divided 
our Nation for years. 
This wouldn’t be an issue today if 
more journalists did their job of being 
the police of our society and govern-
mental system and reported on all in-
vestigations, not just ones that appeal 
to certain political parties. 
What kind of a message does this 
censorship send to a reporter who does 
take on the new allegations against the 
Clinton campaign and its associates 
and 
then 
it 
is 
labeled 
‘‘disinformation’’? I don’t think that is 
going to encourage more journalists to 
cover this issue. 
It is truly mind-blowing that these 
companies continue to interfere in free 
expression. Big Tech is silencing every-
one they disagree with, and clearly 
they see no check to their powers. The 
article I cited—I cited two in my post— 
was on foxnews.com, a mainstream 
news organization. 
Why does Facebook and one of its 
third-party fact-checker partners get 
to make the decision that this news ar-
ticle is considered false information? 
That decision should be made by the 
American people who should be able to 
view that content and decide that fact 
for themselves. It shouldn’t be decided 
by our Big Tech overlords who seem to 
only find fault with content that is 
conservative or goes against the liberal 
narrative. 
These are the same outlets that al-
lowed information relating to the 
Steele dossier to run wild and very 
free, yet censored Hunter Biden’s news 
articles during the 2020 election. 
Now they are doing the bidding for 
the Clinton camp. Why are they so 
afraid of reporting that exposes the 
Russian collusion hoax? Silencing or 
chilling free speech and the back-and- 
forth discussion of ideas is entirely 
wrong. Increasingly, we see the tag 
‘‘misinformation’’ or ‘‘disinformation’’ 
given to content that the liberal main-
stream media simply disagrees with or 
goes against their chosen narrative. 
Finding and seeking the truth should 
not be about silencing voices but allow-
ing robust discourse. 
It is time that we examine the sec-
tion 230 immunity that has enabled 
these companies to avoid any liability. 
We must stop these companies from ar-
bitrarily deciding what speech is ac-
ceptable for this free country we live 
in. It has become increasingly clear 
that these dominant platforms control-
ling discussion and dialogue are more 
beholden to cancel culture and not to 
the fundamentals of free speech prin-
ciples that this country was founded 
upon. 
These Big Tech companies have few 
competitors and are immune from li-
ability. These companies are unac-
countable 
to 
their 
customers, 
the 
courts, and the government. If not for 
their monopoly power and section 230 
immunity, these companies might not 
be involved in the actions and censor-
ship that we see today. 
As a U.S. Senator and someone who 
has been vocally outspoken about my 
concerns with censorship on online 
platforms, I will continue to do every-
thing in my power to prevent the cen-
sorship of speech and ideas on behalf of 
my constituents in Iowa and of course 
on all Americans. Simply put, we de-
serve better than ‘‘woke’’ monopolists 
and their liberal lapdogs deciding what 
we can discuss. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Alaska.

port S. 3614. That is the United States- 
Russian 
Federation

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S769 
February 17, 2022 
Now, let me give you a little bit of 
background on this because it actually 
relates to what is going on in the world 
today. All eyes are currently on the 
Russian aggression toward Ukraine 
right now and for good reason. We have 
seen the stories that the authoritarian 
dictator Vladimir Putin is going to in-
vade Ukraine. We hope, and I think 
every one of us hopes, that doesn’t hap-
pen, but it is looking like it may. 
But what is less talked about is the 
last time there was an invasion by Rus-
sia of Ukraine, what ended up hap-
pening in terms of sanctions and, in 
particular, 
American 
seafood 
sanc-
tions, and the ramifications of the last 
Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
Here is what actually happened. In 
2014, when Putin invaded the Crimean 
Peninsula and eastern Ukraine, Presi-
dent Obama put sanctions on Russia. 
Now, I wasn’t here as a Senator then, 
but I supported them. Russia then re-
taliated in terms of sanctions in 2014, 
and here is one of the things they did. 
They banned all seafood exports from 
America—whether it is Alaska, Massa-
chusetts—into Russia. So that was 
about 9 years ago. That ban still exists 
today. 
Let me repeat this. If you are a big 
fisherman in Massachusetts or the 
great State of Alaska, as the Senator 
from Massachusetts knows, we both 
have thousands of great fishermen, you 
cannot export one fish to Russia. Nine 
years of a ban, and guess what. The 
United States lets Russia’s seafood 
into America almost duty-free. 
Let me repeat that. A ban on Amer-
ican exports to Russia, a 9-year block-
ade, not one Massachusetts fisherman 
or Alaskan fisherman can export his 
great American seafood product to 
Russia. Russia gets to import Russian 
seafood into America duty-free. That is 
called unfair by any measure—by any 
measure. And it certainly is unfair to 
the great fishermen of my State as well 
as the fishermen of Massachusetts. 
Now, I have talked about Alaskan 
fishermen for—well, as long as I have 
been a Senator. About 66 percent of all 
seafood harvested in the United States 
comes from the great State of Alaska. 
So we are big exporters. 
What has happened, though, in this 
regard, is that as we export—we Alas-
kans, fishermen from Massachusetts— 
as we export seafood around the world, 
we have not been able to export any-
thing in that market, the Russian mar-
ket, for 9 years, and at the same time 
the value of Russian seafood imported 
into the United States—surprise—has 
skyrocketed because there is no tariff 
on it. It skyrocketed 173 percent since 
2013. That was the year before the em-
bargo was imposed—again, directly 
competing against American seafood 
producers, American fishermen. 
As a matter of fact, the Russians are 
actually starting to steal market share 
from 
American 
fishermen, 
whether 
Massachusetts or Alaska, and we are 
talking hundreds of millions of dollars. 
This is unfair by anybody’s definition. 
So my bill is very simple. It says, 
like we need in all trade around the 
world, we need just straight-up reci-
procity. Right now, we can’t export a 
thing to Russia, and they export their 
fish to America duty-free. 
So the bill is simple. It just says, 
until we can export into the Russian 
market, they shouldn’t be able to ex-
port into our market. 
I can’t imagine any U.S. Senator ob-
jecting to this. It is called reciprocity. 
It is called fairness. And it is righting 
a wrong that has been in the works for 
9 years now, whether you are a fisher-
man in Massachusetts or a fisherman 
in Alaska. 
I have raised this issue with the 
Obama administration, the Trump ad-
ministration, now the Biden adminis-
tration. We are still waiting on reci-
procity. So it is time to act. The U.S. 
Senate can act, and I am hopeful that 
we are going to act on this today. As a 
matter of fact, I checked with all my 
Republican colleagues, and every sin-
gle one of them is supportive of basic 
reciprocity for fishermen. 
So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Finance Committee 
be discharged from further consider-
ation of S. 3614 and the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration; fur-
ther, I ask unanimous consent that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). Is there objection? 
Mr. MARKEY. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
just want to say that I sincerely re-
spect the Senator from Alaska’s con-
cerns about the Russian seafood im-
ports, and I believe it is unfair. I be-
lieve it is improper that Russia has 
banned American seafood imports since 
2014. So I agree with you. And Alaska 
and Massachusetts are the two fishing 
giants of the United States of America. 
We are. 
However, I have heard from seafood 
processors in my home State with con-
cerns about potential sudden effects of 
a new immediate ban on imports on 
their workforce, including hundreds of 
union workers in the seafood proc-
essing industry. That would be right 
now. 
So, with that in mind, I am going to 
object to passage of this bill at this 
time, but I would say to my friend 
from Alaska that I would invite a col-
laboration on this subject because I 
think we can resolve it so that it bene-
fits not just Alaska, which is very im-
portant, but also Massachusetts and 
every other State. And, again, I think 
we can, in fact, bring all the stake-
holders together, do it very briefly 
maybe over this break that we are 
about to begin here in the Senate. 
I am very grateful to the Senator 
from Alaska for raising this very im-
portant issue, and I want to assure him 
and all of the Alaska fishing industry 
that we want to have conversations 
that protect the American seafood in-
dustry and its workers and I want to 
partner with him toward that goal and 
maybe just use the next 10 days or so 
to accomplish that goal. So at this 
point I would object to the motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
appreciate my friend Senator MARKEY, 
his offer to work through this. 
He and I have worked together on a 
number of issues, actually a number of 
issues particularly related to Amer-
ica’s fishermen. As he mentioned, Mas-
sachusetts has a lot of fishermen, and I 
have tens of thousands of my fellow 
Alaskans involved in the industry. 
And, again, I think he and I certainly 
agree with this concept. I think every 
U.S. Senator agrees with the concept of 
basic fairness in trade, basic fairness, 
in terms of reciprocity, in trade—all 
trade but especially the seafood trade. 
We have had 9 years of no reciprocity 
from 
Russia—Putin, 
the 
thug. 
We 
shouldn’t have to take it anymore, and 
it is hurting my constituents. 
Now, my understanding of the issue 
raised by Senator MARKEY is that it is 
primarily Russian pollock that is im-
ported into Massachusetts. As Senator 
MARKEY knows, in Alaska, we have a 
huge number of fishermen engaged in 
that fishery. So maybe what we should 
look at is making sure Massachusetts’ 
workers are actually processing Amer-
ican—Alaskan—pollock, not the au-
thoritarian pollock in Russia. That 
would be a fair way to resolve this. 
I appreciate the offer to work to-
gether on this, but I will tell the Sen-
ator we need to work quickly because 
it has been 9 years of nonreciprocal 
seafood trade. I am almost certain that 
Massachusetts fishermen who once ex-
ported to Russia have been hurt by this 
seafood blockade as well as my fisher-
men. I take Senator MARKEY’s offer 
and suggestion in good faith. Hope-
fully, we can work over the work pe-
riod in the next couple of weeks and 
get to a result on this. 
Alaskans will supply Massachusetts’ 
workers pollock or cod or whatever you 
are processing, and then we will bring 
reciprocity in terms of trade, which 
currently does not exist, between Rus-
sia and the United States. It is wrong. 
It is unfair. It needs to be fixed by us, 
and it needs to be fixed by the Biden 
administration as well. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF MICHELE TAYLOR 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in a 
bit, I hope to be able to put forward 
and pass a unanimous consent request, 
asking the Senate to take up and ap-
prove the nomination of Ms. Michele 
Taylor to serve as the U.S. Representa-
tive to the U.N. Human Rights Council, 
with the rank of Ambassador. Before I 
put that request forward, I want to

February 17, 2022 
take just a few minutes to talk about 
why Ms. Taylor is, in my view, the 
right choice for this important role and 
why the Senate must act on her nomi-
nation quickly. 
In blunt terms, Michele Taylor is 
simply a champion for fundamental 
human and political rights. She now 
serves on the board of the National 
Center for Civil and Human Rights. 
She has been a leader with other hu-
manitarian groups, including the Anti- 
Defamation League and the U.S. Holo-
caust Memorial Museum Council. She 
has battled for the rights of women and 
other vulnerable Americans. 
On a personal level, I come from a 
family who lost some relatives in the 
Holocaust. Ms. Taylor is the daughter 
of a Holocaust survivor. It is abso-
lutely essential that fighting against 
the rise of anti-Semitism is a key part 
of America’s diplomacy. Ms. Taylor 
certainly understands that. 
I am confident she will work to lead 
our partners and allies toward a more 
peaceful, prosperous future, grounded 
in respect for human dignity. 
In the Senate, there is bipartisan in-
terest in ensuring that the United 
States stands up and battles for human 
rights around the world. For example, 
on the Finance Committee, Senator 
BROWN, Senator CRAPO, and I have put 
in a lot of hours in recent years to ad-
dress the scourge of forced labor in 
China and elsewhere in the world. I 
know, also, that this is a subject that 
the President of the Senate cares deep-
ly about. This is just one of the human 
rights atrocities that our country must 
stand up to forcefully. 
The Senate must show that our con-
cern for these issues is more than just 
idle talk. That is why the Senate must 
not delay the nominations of highly 
qualified individuals, like Ms. Michele 
Taylor, who are up for consideration in 
key roles in advancing human rights. 
There is a matter of the sensitivity 
of the time as well. The regular session 
of the U.N. Human Rights Council be-
gins on February 28, which is, obvi-
ously, just days away. It is essential, in 
my view, that we confirm our rep-
resentative now. Delaying Ms. Taylor’s 
confirmation 
simply 
hinders 
the 
United States’ ability to advocate for 
American values and help vulnerable 
people who are suffering under abuse 
and oppression around the world. 
Moving this nomination forward is 
an opportunity for the Senate to show 
this Chamber’s commitment to advanc-
ing human rights is, in fact, more than 
just talk. There is a deadline—a spe-
cific, concrete deadline, February 28— 
that is bearing down on the Chamber. 
There simply is no more time to delay 
on this important nomination. 
We await a colleague who would like 
to have a chance to be heard on this, to 
consider it. I do hope that we can work 
this out here in the afternoon. Hope-
fully, the Senate will wrap up business 
this afternoon because this really is 
time-sensitive. 
Members talk about matters that ac-
tually may be coming up; this one is 
upon us. I do hope that we will be able 
to clear Ms. Michele Taylor to serve as 
U.S. Representative to the U.N. Human 
Rights Council with the rank of Am-
bassador before the close of business 
today. 
Thank you. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CHINA 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the 
aggressive and hostile actions of the 
Chinese Communist Party pose a mas-
sive threat to the global order. The 
Chinese Communist Party’s strategy 
can be summed up in four Rs: resist, re-
duce, replace, and reorder. 
China resists American economic in-
fluence 
by 
manipulating 
American 
businesses and industries and stealing 
intellectual property. 
It reduces internal dissent and free 
expression of ideas through surveil-
lance and censorship of its own people. 
It is essentially a police state. And it 
seeks to assert its power and influence 
in the United States by various means. 
The Chinese Communist Party in-
tends to replace America as the world’s 
technology leader through its Made in 
China 2025 initiative, which seeks to 
achieve Chinese dominance in high- 
tech manufacturing. 
And, of course, it hopes to reorder 
international norms and institutions 
around itself. 
The CCP’s mantra can best be de-
scribed as ‘‘Win at all costs.’’ And, 
make no mistake, its reckless actions 
paint an alarming picture for the 
United States and our allies. For ev-
erything from national security to eco-
nomic policy, there is a clear and ur-
gent need to reorient our way of think-
ing on how we should respond to this 
threat from China. 
Despite the partisanship that has 
sometimes gripped this Chamber for 
more than a year now, this is one area 
where, thankfully, there is broad bipar-
tisan agreement. Our colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle recognize the 
growing threats posed by the CCP and 
the need to act. 
So last summer the Senate took a 
major step forward by passing the U.S. 
Innovation and Competition Act. This 
bipartisan bill was the result of intense 
bipartisan 
negotiations, 
with 
our 
friend Senator YOUNG
from Indiana 
leading negotiations on our side of the 
aisle. This legislation addresses a range 
of issues to help the United States re-
duce its reliance on China and to 
counter looming threats from the Com-
munist Party. 
Without question, the cornerstone of 
USICA, as it is called, is funding for 
programs created by the CHIPS Act, 
which I introduced with the Senator 
from Virginia, Mr. WARNER, in 2020 and 
nearly every Senator in this body has 
supported. Semiconductor chips, which 
we have all had to learn a lot more 
about, 
are 
everywhere—from 
cell 
phones to cars to agricultural equip-
ment to missile defense systems. De-
spite our need for a strong supply of 
these semiconductor chips, we over-
whelmingly rely on other countries— 
most of them in Asia—to produce 
them. Taiwan alone produces about 63 
percent of the advanced semiconduc-
tors in the world. 
If, for some reason, our supply of 
these semiconductors was cut off as the 
result of a natural disaster or another 
pandemic or military conflict, it would 
lead to very serious consequences for 
both our national security as well as 
our economy. When we talk about the 
need to address threats to our supply 
chain and threats coming from the 
People’s 
Republic 
of 
China, 
semi-
conductors are front and center. 
Now, USICA provided the CHIPS pro-
gram with $52 billion to bolster domes-
tic semiconductor manufacturing and 
to secure this vulnerable supply chain. 
This legislation passed the Senate last 
summer by a vote of 68 to 32, which is 
an incredible bipartisan accomplish-
ment these days. 
Unfortunately, the House of Rep-
resentatives refused to act on this bi-
partisan bill. They said they wanted to 
pass their own version, which they 
have every right to do, of course, but 
they also should have been working at 
it diligently and acted quickly. The 
Chinese Communist Party simply isn’t 
sitting around waiting on House Demo-
crats to get their act together. 
So it took 8 months before the House 
of Representatives passed a bill aimed 
at competition with China; but, unfor-
tunately, they chose to go the easy 
way, which is to pass strictly a par-
tisan bill, which virtually no Repub-
lican supported. Instead of mirroring 
the bipartisan process here in the Sen-
ate, Democrats only negotiated among 
themselves and excluded Republicans 
from that process. 
Democratic committee chairmen re-
fused to consult with their Republican 
ranking members, and they ran off 
with the pen and crafted a partisan and 
unserious bill. Sure, this legislation 
does include a few bipartisan measures 
like CHIPs funding, as well as a pro-
posal I led with Mr. CASEY, the Senator 
from Pennsylvania, to review limited 
outbound investments in China. 
But House Democrats don’t deserve a 
lot of credit for including a few bipar-
tisan bills that they already support. 
They kept some of the overwhelmingly 
partisan pieces of USICA and tacked on 
a laundry list of unrelated and con-
troversial provisions. The House-passed 
bill sends a whopping $8 billion to a 
U.N. climate slush fund, which has pro-
vided more than $100 million to China 
alone. So if the purpose of this effort is 
to counter threats from China, it 
doesn’t exactly accomplish that goal 
when we end up sending money to 
China.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S771 
February 17, 2022 
Democrats also added provisions in 
the House related to immigration, from 
creating new types of visas to remov-
ing green card caps. Now, immigration 
is a serious and important issue, but 
these can’t expect to see the light of 
day being haphazardly tacked on to 
this legislation. They need to be de-
bated and marked up by the appro-
priate legislative committees and ne-
gotiated. 
Well, in true fashion, House Demo-
crats added a range of handouts to 
their political supporters, especially 
labor unions. From massive slush funds 
to burdensome new labor requirements, 
unions would win big with the House 
bill. The labor bosses apparently were 
promised some pretty big benefits in 
the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spend-
ing spree bill. 
Since that bill is now dead and bur-
ied, it looks like this was their way to 
try to appease their political sup-
porters. 
As we have learned over the last 
year, our colleagues in the House can’t 
seem to resist any opportunity to 
sneak 
in 
ridiculous 
partisan 
pet 
projects. Their bill would also establish 
a coral reef task force—you heard me 
correctly, a coral reef task force—and 
put $6 million toward a national coral 
reef management fellowship. Believe it 
or not, the term ‘‘coral reef’’ is men-
tioned more than 300 times in the 
House bill. No wonder it took them so 
long to put the bill together. 
Of course, it is not just what is in 
this bill that is a problem; it is what 
was left out. The bill’s trade title— 
which was one of the most important 
parts of what the Senate did, cham-
pioned by the Senator from Idaho, the 
ranking member of the Finance Com-
mittee, Mr. CRAPO—but the House 
trade bill is entirely inadequate. It ex-
tends and expands trade adjustment as-
sistance, which is normally something 
we do when we approve of a trade deal, 
like the USMCA, the United States- 
Mexico-Canada Agreement. But they 
left out the most important part, 
which was trade promotion authority. 
We know trade promotion authority 
is absolutely critical to brokering 
strong trade agreements without ex-
traordinary delays. What the House did 
by including trade adjustment assist-
ance without trade promotion author-
ity does nothing to advance our goals 
to open up markets to American-made 
goods and services and agriculture. 
Well, the House bill also fails to push 
for a digital trade agreement and iden-
tify countries, like the People’s Repub-
lic of China, that use censorship as a 
way to limit access to our tech indus-
try, and it doesn’t narrow relief from 
tariffs for businesses experiencing se-
vere economic harm that has broad bi-
partisan support. 
So it is no surprise that the House 
bill was passed almost entirely along 
party lines. Unlike the bipartisan legis-
lation here in the Senate, the House 
bill is an unserious attempt to help 
America compete with China. It just 
simply doesn’t cut the mustard. 
House Democrats wasted about 8 
months while they waited and waited 
and waited before even acting in this 
totally inadequate manner. And there 
is no chance, of course, the Senate will 
pass 
anything 
that 
resembles 
the 
House bill. We do need legislation to 
confront growing threats from China, 
but we need to do it correctly. That 
means what we need is a formal con-
ference committee between the House 
and the Senate and to ensure ulti-
mately that the final product looks a 
whole lot like the Senate bill, which 
passed, as I said, with strong bipartisan 
support. 
This is really nothing to be toyed 
with. This is a matter of national and 
economic security and something far 
too important for partisan jockeying 
such as demonstrated by the House of 
Representatives in their totally inad-
equate and unserious piece of legisla-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, we 
are about—at least many of us—ready 
to return home to our States and to 
visit with our constituents in person, 
and that is a common practice for me. 
I can indicate to my colleagues in the 
Senate that the conversations—they 
are wide-ranging at home, but cer-
tainly, if there is a theme, it is the 
consequences that Americans and Kan-
sans are feeling in regard to inflation. 
The things at the grocery store, the 
price at the pump, rent—all those 
things are rising, and people are strug-
gling to pay the bills. Things are being 
left out of what someone can afford in 
their budget because everything costs 
more. 
Kansas is an energy-producing State. 
We certainly are an agricultural State. 
I would tell you, when I talk to farmers 
and ranchers, commodity prices have 
gone up. One might think that is some-
thing that would be very beneficial to 
farmers, but this inflation has raised 
the price of everything they purchase 
to create the crops that feed us across 
America and around the world. 
One of the components and one of the 
reasons that inflation is rising so rap-
idly is energy costs. Even for my farm-
ers, fertilizer is made from phosphates 
and natural gas. Diesel fuel is used in 
the vehicles and tractors and trucks. 
Our ability to provide that food for the 
world is being hampered because we are 
going to lose money when we grow 
crops even though they may bring a 
higher price than they did just a few 
months ago. 
So many components of what we pur-
chase in this country and one of the 
reasons costs are all rising is because 
of the price of oil and gas. I am con-
fused by the policies that many in this 
body promote. At the same time, they 
are asking for relief at the pump. Yet, 
time and time again, what policies, 
what legislation, what conversations 
here, what actions are taken—particu-
larly by Democrats—are to reduce the 
supply of oil and natural gas. 
It makes no sense to me when the 
policy—in fact, how can it make sense 
for people to propose to eliminate the 
tax on gas? I suppose their interest in 
making gas more expensive is to re-
duce the use of oil and natural gas fos-
sil fuels, but on the other hand, if they 
lower the tax on gas, it would lower 
the price, which is to encourage the 
ability to purchase. 
President Biden asked the Russians 
to increase their production in order to 
alleviate the price at the pump in the 
United States. We have been talking to 
Europe about how we are going to help 
them solve their natural gas shortage 
should we have a crisis in Ukraine and 
natural gas can no longer be imported 
from Russia, and we are working to 
provide more natural gas. 
We should be doing everything in our 
country to increase the supply. The 
definition of ‘‘inflation’’ is, I think, 
pretty basic. It is ‘‘too few goods being 
chased by the same amount of dollars.’’ 
Even this week in the Banking Com-
mittee, the conversation over the last 
month has been about whether or not 
the Federal Reserve, which has no abil-
ity, no legal ability, no purpose in set-
ting the price of gas and oil—and they 
would do so by trying to restrict loans 
by financial institutions to oil and gas 
energy producers at the same time 
they are supposed to be combating in-
flation. 
So it seems to me on one hand and on 
the other hand, they don’t make any 
sense. They are not logical and in so 
many instances, hypocritical. 
We want to have an energy policy 
that is to produce more. I am ‘‘all of 
the above’’ on energy, but the policies 
of this country which we see trying to 
eliminate oil and natural gas, fossil 
fuels, at a time in which the cost at the 
pump, the cost in agriculture, the cost 
at the grocery store is rising—we 
should be focused on trying to make 
certain that Americans can afford to 
live in this country. We will not 
achieve that by trying to eliminate or 
reduce the supply of natural gas and 
oil. 
I will be talking to my constituents 
about this issue, as I return home this 
week. 
I wish we could have a coherent con-
versation, discussion, on policy devel-
opment. 
We need to produce more. The days 
in which we became energy inde-
pendent in the last administration 
were ones in which we felt a sense of 
relief, a sense of safety and security, 
and I long for the days in which we are 
able to recognize that our national se-
curity and our economics are benefited 
by a strong oil and gas industry meet-
ing the needs of Americans, taking 
care of ourselves at home and pro-
viding greater national security as we 
deal with crises around the world. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S772 
February 17, 2022 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to commend my colleague and 
friend from Kansas. He said very, very 
eloquently that the administration’s 
policies right now, which are anti-en-
ergy—they are driving up energy prices 
on working families. And it is national 
security suicide to unilaterally disarm 
energy when Putin uses energy as a 
weapon. We all know that. 
Some of the window dressing here on 
these bills lately from my Senate 
Democratic colleagues is just that—po-
litical window dressing. We all need to 
go to the White House and say: Get 
your act together, Mr. President, your 
team. Produce more American energy. 
That is what we all need. It will help 
with inflation and will help with na-
tional security. 
So to my colleague from Kansas, 
thank you very much. We all come 
from States that produce energy. And 
these are great American workers, too, 
by the way, who sometimes get ma-
ligned because they produce energy. 
Imagine that. 
TRIBUTE TO DOUG KEIL 
Mr. President, I want to move on to 
my favorite time of the week. It is 
Thursday, so I usually come down on 
the Senate floor and talk about the 
Alaskan of the Week. 
Now, we all believe our States are 
the best. Each State loves to brag a lit-
tle bit about their own State. That is 
great. It is what makes our country 
competitive, a little bit of competition 
here in the Senate. But I happen to 
speak the truth when I talk about how 
Alaska is the best State, and it is be-
cause of the people. 
I am going to talk a little bit about 
Doug Keil, who is today’s Alaskan of 
the Week. I always like to start—you 
know, the pages enjoy this speech a lot 
because we get to talk a little bit 
about Alaska and the adventures and 
what is happening in the great State of 
Alaska. So I will give a little update on 
that. 
On January 22, that was the polar 
night in Utqiagvik, AK, the northern-
most town in all of North America. 
What happened on January 22 is that 
polar night—as they call it there—fi-
nally ended. That is 65 days of darkness 
finally ended. That is 65 days of dark-
ness. 
On January 22, the Sun crept a little 
over the horizon briefly. Like a long 
lost friend, the community gathered to 
say hello to the Sun. It has been cold 
up North. It has been a cold winter. It 
is about 20 below in Utqiagvik today. It 
has been relatively balmy in Anchor-
age where our Alaskan of the Week 
lives—warm enough to be sleeting 
right now. 
But in all weather, all around the 
State, people are getting out, gath-
ering, enjoying the Sun that stays in 
our skies a little bit longer each day. 
They are dogsledding—training for the 
Iditarod. They are snow-machining, 
playing hockey, skiing, snowboarding— 
so many winter sports. 
We, in our State, are chockful of ex-
cellent winter athletes—great winter 
athletes. We punch way above our 
weight in terms of Winter Olympics. 
Many Alaskans are competing now in 
Beijing, as we speak, and we are root-
ing for all of them. Of course, we are 
rooting for all of America’s athletes. 
We are also preparing to root for the 
amazing athletes who will be com-
peting in the Paralympics, also in Bei-
jing, starting March 4. Again, many 
Alaskans will be there competing: 
cross-country 
skier, 
Grace 
Miller; 
snowboarder, Katy Maddry, a former 
Alaskan of the Week alum; and former 
gold 
medal 
Paralympian, 
Andrew 
Kurka. He will be competing in Beijing 
in the sit-ski events. 
Now, I am mentioning all of this be-
cause our Alaskan of the Week, Doug 
Keil, says every one of these athletes— 
both 
in 
the 
Olympics 
and 
in 
Paralympics and all of our amateur 
athletes across the State—are there be-
cause of athletes who have gone before 
them. I think that is true. 
Paving that path, of course, has been 
all the more challenging for America’s 
Paralympian athletes. But it is a path 
that Doug, our Alaskan of the Week, 
has really paved for Alaska—for Amer-
ica—a deep one. And he has done it 
through grit and pain and determina-
tion. 
In 1980, Doug Keil brought home two 
gold medals from the 1980 Paralympic 
Games in Norway. That was the sec-
ond-ever Paralympic Games. He was 
the first American male to bring home 
gold in those games, and he spent the 
next 30-plus years building not only the 
structures and the organizations but, 
importantly, the culture in Alaska and 
in America to make sure other athletes 
with disabilities could come after him. 
Let me tell you a little bit about our 
Alaskan of the Week, Doug Keil. Doug 
was born in Beirut, Lebanon. His par-
ents Don and Margaret, who went by 
‘‘Midge,’’ were adventuresome. From 
New York, they were on a 4-year over-
seas trip. Don, the father, was teaching 
high school physics and Midge was 
working at the United Nations in the 
Palestinian refugee camps when they 
had Doug, the oldest of what would be 
five children, four girls and Doug. I 
know one of the girls really well, 
Carrie, Doug’s sister, who works as 
part of my team in Anchorage doing 
constituent casework. She recently hit 
the milestone of successfully helping 
2,000 different Alaskans. Carrie, great 
job. You are amazing—just as amazing 
as your brother Doug. Her success rate 
is off the charts. I see it every day. 
When Doug and Carrie’s family came 
back to America, they moved to Alas-
ka. Don’s brother—that is the dad, 
Don—built houses, and Don helped him 
for a while. Eventually, Don the fa-
ther—Doug’s father—got a senior job 
with the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion. 
Doug, our Alaskan of the Week, was 
an active kid. He loved sports, mostly 
baseball and skiing. His plan was to 
follow in his father’s footsteps and go 
to Springfield College in Massachu-
setts. He wanted to be a physical edu-
cation teacher and to play baseball, 
but he had some tragedy. When Doug 
was 15, he took a trip to Juneau to 
visit a school friend. And on August 28, 
1968, he and his friend were exploring 
an old gold mine in Juneau. Doug got 
struck by 24,000 volts of electricity— 
24,000 volts of electricity. In the proc-
ess, he lost an arm and lost a leg. As we 
can all expect, the next few years were 
very difficult ones for Doug and his 
family. As he said, ‘‘When you get hit 
by 24,000 volts of electricity, it messes 
you up physically. Mentally, my whole 
world was gone.’’ 
Talk about grit and determination. 
He spent about 2 years in the hospital 
and his dreams, he thought, had died. 
To make it all the more difficult, his 
father had to move the family to the 
DC area for a job with the FAA when 
Doug was just a sophomore in high 
school, still learning how to use an ar-
tificial arm and artificial leg. But the 
family stuck together. They had faith, 
and they pulled through. 
Back in Alaska, though, something 
remarkable happened. At this point, 
Doug hadn’t tried to ski again because 
he thought those days were over with-
out an arm, without a leg. But some-
one in their church told his parents 
about a program in Colorado—in Win-
ter Park, CO—where they were train-
ing athletes to ski with disabilities. 
The first day he was there, Doug went 
to Winter Park. It coincided with the 
first day of what was then called the 
National Handicapped Championships. 
Doug said: 
I saw amazing athletes. I saw men and 
women who had come back [many disabled 
veterans from Vietnam]. . . . I saw them ski-
ing and it opened up my eyes to a completely 
different world. 
Doug was inspired in many ways by 
our disabled Vietnam veterans who 
helped train him, helped inspire him. 
He came back to Alaska to train in 
this area and went back to Winter 
Park in 1977 to race in the Nationals in 
the slalom event and did so again in 
1979, both of which qualified him for 
the 1980 Paralympics. 
Along with two gold medals from 
those Olympics, he brought a mission 
back to Alaska: starting a skiing pro-
gram for people with physical disabil-
ities. He said at the time that skiing 
was amazing. It would give him a ‘‘feel-
ing of motion. It’s like running again. 
It can be fluid. When it feels good up 
through your body, your body smiles 
and 
when 
your 
body 
smiles, 
you 
smile.’’ And he wanted others to have 
that experience. 
In the 1980s, of course, Alaska had 
mountains and snow and landscape 
begging to be played in but did not 
have a culture that encouraged people 
with disabilities to be part of those 
winter activities. Doug explained to a 
reporter in 1980 that as a one-legged 
skier, he was an anomaly in Alaska. 
He said: 
I’ve been skiing [there] for 5 years by my-
self. Up . . . [in Alaska]—

February 17, 2022 
Someone with disabilities— 
[T]hey see me coming down the slopes and 
they say ‘‘What the [heck] is that?’’ People 
just [weren’t] used to [seeing] it [in 1980]. 
And this is where the story moves 
from one individual, Doug, to thou-
sands. Doug and a handful of others got 
busy. They formed a nonprofit called 
Challenge Alaska, and they hit the 
road. Doug, who had a full-time job in 
cable, still made the time for starting 
this 
great 
organization, 
Challenge 
Alaska. They got people out on the 
slopes. They trained them. They gath-
ered all the adaptive equipment they 
could get their hands on, and they dug 
in. 
Forty years later, with an expanded 
mission now including all outdoor ac-
tivities, including summer activities— 
kayaking, cycling, wheelchair Frisbee, 
fishing, camping, and so much more— 
Challenge Alaska, started by Doug 
Keil, has helped over a thousand people 
in Alaska get out into Alaska’s great 
outdoors in winter and summer. Some 
of the most incredible athletes you 
have ever met started their careers in 
athletics with Challenge Alaska. 
Just two weekends ago, my wife 
Julie and I had the opportunity to at-
tend Challenge Alaska’s 40th anniver-
sary gala dinner. Now, I know a lot of 
my colleagues here—we go out to a lot 
of events when we are back home. This 
was one of the most inspiring events I 
have attended in a long, long time. 
Julie and I got to sit with the current 
executive director of Challenge Alaska, 
Nate Boltz; his wife, Leah; daughter, 
Anna; his parents, Jim and Laurie; his 
grandmother, 
Adeline. 
There 
were 
amazing speeches. One young man 
named Ryan Johnson, a recent high 
school graduate with cerebral palsy, 
spoke. Incredible. There wasn’t a dry 
eye in the house. 
And, of course, Doug was there. Doug 
was there, the founder of Challenge 
Alaska—40 years of work—and he was 
honored for this great life achieve-
ment. 
In that 1980 article I mentioned ear-
lier, I talked about when he was talk-
ing about skiing on the slopes alone as 
someone with one leg, he said that if he 
could have a plaque that said he was 
instrumental in starting a program to 
help other people with disabilities in 
Alaska to learn to enjoy the outdoors— 
skiing, winter, summer—he would be a 
happy man. That was 40 years ago 
when he said that. Well, he should be 
happy. He has done that and so much 
more. Thousands of people have been 
positively impacted by what he has 
done. 
Here is another remarkable thing. 
His inspiration went far beyond Alas-
ka. It has literally touched the globe. 
He tells the story about how in the 
nineties, 13 people with disabilities 
from Japan came to ski with and learn 
from the people in Challenge Alaska. 
Doug was working at Challenge Alas-
ka. He, unfortunately, wasn’t able to 
ski with our Japanese visitors. But 
when they were leaving town, he met 
them at the airport to say goodbye. 
One of them, who was also missing an 
arm and a leg from a construction acci-
dent, stepped forward and, through an 
interpreter, told Doug that after his 
accident, he thought about taking his 
own life. Then this young Japanese 
man said to Doug that he saw a docu-
mentary about Doug. And he said to 
Doug: 
I vowed that I would learn to ski, [I would] 
come to Alaska and ski with [Challenge 
Alaska]. Thank you [Doug] for saving my 
life. 
That is pretty powerful stuff right 
there—one person in Japan whose life 
was saved by Doug Keil and all the 
great people at Challenge Alaska. 
So, Doug, thank you for saving lives. 
Thank you for your inspiration to so 
many. Thank you for what you have 
done for Alaska, for Challenge Alaska, 
for the State, for the Paralympian ath-
letes we are going to watch and cheer 
on here in a couple of weeks. And con-
gratulations on being our Alaskan of 
the Week. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3632 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, a few days 
ago or a few weeks—about 2 weeks ago, 
I was surprised to read in an article 
that, as part of the American Rescue 
Plan, there was this $30-million pro-
gram that would be sending drug para-
phernalia to people suffering from ad-
diction in this country. 
And so I said something about it, and 
the administration came out and said 
that is not true. We are not going to 
use it for that. We are not going to be 
sending out crack pipes or meth pipes 
to anybody. In fact, they even wrote a 
letter to a fellow Senator here in that 
regard. 
So then I said, well, since—let’s just 
make sure. Right? Like, let’s just file a 
bill language that just makes it clear 
that we are not going to be sending 
drug paraphernalia like a pipe or 
things that work with a pipe, that tax-
payers aren’t going to be paying for 
that. 
And lo and behold, I was surprised by 
the response. And now, when you read 
more carefully the letter that they 
wrote to Senator BLACKBURN, you see 
exactly what the problem is here. 
They don’t plan on sending crack 
pipes or meth pipes to anybody. What 
they plan on sending is what they call 
a mouthpiece. And a mouthpiece isn’t 
what you think. It is not like some flat 
thing that you put in your mouth. No, 
the mouthpiece is basically the cylin-
drical tube—straw-looking thing—that 
you attach to the crack pipe. So the 
pipe will have to be shared by the ad-
dicts, but they are each going to have 
their own little tube that they can at-
tach to smoke it. 
Well, I just don’t think the Federal 
Government should be paying for that 
to send that to people. I think, frankly, 
this is insane. I think most people 
would agree, and I think most people 
would be surprised. 
And the things you discover when 
you actually file these things and work 
on it—because we came up with lan-
guage. We said: OK. Here is the bill, 
and here is what we want to do. And 
they came back and said: We will not 
agree to it if it includes that device 
that attaches to it. 
So, apparently, they don’t want to 
send out crack pipes, but they do want 
to send out the tubes that attach to 
the crack pipes so that those who are 
addicted to crack or any of these other 
drugs—illicit drugs that you can smoke 
can be consumed safely somehow, as if 
there is any safe way to smoke meth or 
crack, which there isn’t. 
And so what I have come here to do 
today is very simple: I want this bill to 
pass. I don’t know why anyone could 
possibly object to it unless you believe 
that you should be sending out cylin-
drical tubing which attaches to a crack 
pipe to smoke and that can be removed 
to allow multiple people to use the 
same pipe. 
And that is the loophole that they 
want. That is what they want me to 
change this bill to allow them to send 
out. And I think that is nuts, guys. I 
don’t know how else to describe it. 
There is no, like, fancy word for it. It 
is crazy. This is insane. This is the 
kind of insanity that people read about 
and say: This can’t be true. It is true. 
It is actually worse than I thought. 
And so that is why I am hoping we 
can pass this today. Apparently, there 
will be an objection. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 3632 and that the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration. I further 
ask that the Rubio substitute amend-
ment at the desk be considered and 
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, and I think my 
friend from Florida knows I will. This 
entire issue is a misnomer. There have 
been a few online things to try to make 
a big deal out of it, and I am sorry that 
some have fallen for it, but the Biden 
administration produced a letter this 
week clarifying this misunderstanding. 
The administration stated clearly 
they never authorized use of Federal 
funding for smoke pipes and will not in 
the future. In fact, I don’t think any 
administration has. 
Of course, the bill that the Senator 
from Florida is proposing goes much 
further than Republicans say it would. 
It would severely cripple our ability to 
respond to addiction, which has taken 
100,000 lives a year right now, including 
lives in his State and mine. 
We offered an alternative; but that 
was rejected.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S774 
February 17, 2022 
We actually have to go to the CR 
now. The House is gone. We have to 
pass it—the CR and send it to the 
President without amendments or our 
government funding runs out. 
And I might just say—I mean, every-
body has the right to speak about any-
thing they want. Everybody has the 
right to make any kind of political 
point for any group they want, but let’s 
talk about being U.S. Senators. 
A war is about to start in Ukraine, in 
all likelihood. And what we are saying 
is we will start putting all of these 
things in, slow up a continuing resolu-
tion so the United States Government 
will have to shut down tomorrow 
night. 
And we can stand there and Putin 
can say: Why should I listen to them? 
Three or four people can go on their 
Senate floor and shut down the govern-
ment. Why should I listen to them? 
So I object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, couple 
things. To be clear, I am not slowing 
down the continuing resolution. This is 
my bill. It has got nothing to do with 
the continuing resolution. 
The reason why we are not voting on 
the continuing resolution is because 
there is a bunch of people missing; 
there are not enough people here yet to 
vote for it. That is why it is being 
slowed down. So I took this oppor-
tunity to offer my bill. 
And I would just say, my observation 
would be that Vladimir Putin is prob-
ably—if he is even paying attention—I 
don’t know what time it is. He prob-
ably has his hands full with his plans 
to 
invade 
and 
conquer 
parts 
of 
Ukraine—I think he would be won-
dering why would I be scared of a coun-
try who is going to send out cylindrical 
tubing to people addicted to crack and 
meth, because I think he probably 
thinks it is crazy too, as crazy as he is. 
So, again, my bill goes—I get it. 
They are not going to send out pipes. 
That doesn’t make me feel better be-
cause they are going to send out—with 
the money of the American taxpayer, 
they are going to send out cylindrical 
tubing which is attached to a crack 
pipe and can be removed so each and 
every one of the people using that 
pipe—multiple people can use the pipe 
but use a different cylindrical tube to 
attach to it. And I just don’t think the 
American people should be paying for 
that, and that is what HHS has basi-
cally admitted they want to do with 
this money. And I didn’t think this was 
going to be controversial, but appar-
ently it is because there has been an 
objection, so here we are. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the sug-
gestion is many people aren’t here to 
vote. Well, let’s bring up the con-
tinuing resolution. Let’s vote it up or 
down. Let’s say to the rest of the 
world, including Russia, the most pow-
erful nation on Earth can stay open or 
a few Senators can say: No, golly, we 
got to get something on television. We 
ought to close down the government. 
The Senator from Florida is welcome 
to bring up his bill sometime in regular 
order. Let’s not slow up things now. So 
let’s vote on the continuing resolution. 
Let’s show the United States of Amer-
ica and the rest of the world that we 
can stay open and that we are not 
afraid to stay open. We will stay open, 
and we all—I think we could probably 
say unanimously, I would hope—oppose 
what Russia apparently is planning to 
do in Ukraine. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 4930 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, over the 
next couple hours, we are going to have 
another CR vote, and we are going to 
get some votes on amendments. 
When I came to the Senate 3 years 
ago, a little over that, one of my main 
goals—I always respected the Senator 
from Oklahoma, Dr. Tom Coburn. 
I first saw him when he was actually 
on one of the shows talking about the 
same subject that I harp on all the 
time. The difference is, by standards of 
indebtedness, we had no real worries 
other than he was one that could see 
into the future. 
I come from the world of running a 
business, was on a school board, State 
legislature. You couldn’t get by with 
what we get by with here. You had a 
budgeting process. When I was a State 
legislator, you took it through com-
mittees. You brought in witnesses, you 
fleshed it out. Maybe you didn’t need 
more money. Generally, even at the 
statehouse, they would ask for more. It 
wasn’t necessarily the case. 
You did the hard work, rolling up 
your sleeves, which Hoosiers appre-
ciated. Do you know what it has given 
us back in the State of Indiana? The 
highest credit rating you can have as a 
State. It has given us rainy day funds. 
When COVID came along, we could 
have gotten by without a dollar from 
the Federal Government. That is what 
happens when you live your everyday 
life with responsibility, just like every 
American has to, just like you have to 
do in any other level of government. 
Think about running a business. 
Imagine, up until the recent spending 
spree, we were only borrowing roughly 
23 percent of every dollar that we spend 
here—and this isn’t on tangible invest-
ments; this is on consumption. There is 
nothing to show for it. 
A lot of the things we do, a lot of the 
things that people look to us to do, we 
need; but we are doing a disservice to 
our kids and our grandkids—by the 
way, who we are actually borrowing 
the money from—when we run the big-
gest business in the world by the seat 
of its pants. 
I am going to tell you just generally 
how this all plays out. In 41⁄2 years, we 
are going to completely go through the 
Medicare trust fund. And by the way, 
healthcare expenses based upon a bro-
ken healthcare industry that is not 
transparent does not deliver the con-
sumer good value, something that all 
of us that own businesses other than 
the healthcare business have to grapple 
with every year. They need to reform 
themselves, and that would bring Medi-
care and Medicaid into where it wasn’t 
costing us so much. But still then, even 
if you save there, we probably would 
find a way to spend the savings. 
We are currently, basically the only 
reserve currency. That is what keeps 
our interest rates so low. Historically, 
they have been three to four times 
what they are now. And you cannot run 
now probably close to $1.5 trillion defi-
cits on to the $30 trillion we are al-
ready in debt and think that is a good 
business plan for the biggest business 
in the world. 
So especially for the folks on the 
other side of the aisle, but I am going 
to say we have been complicit as Re-
publicans. We roll over to give them 
what they want on domestic spending, 
and they do the same on defense spend-
ing, which I think is probably the most 
important thing we do. And all of a 
sudden, everybody is happy. It is called 
bipartisan, but it is not honest to the 
American public. 
So, here, we are going to do what we 
have been doing for years. We are going 
to vote on a CR later. But if we are 
ever going to get this place back in 
good shape, we have to have the polit-
ical will and the discipline to get back 
to budgeting and not spend beyond our 
means because, some day, we may not 
be the reserve currency. And after we 
go through the Medicare trust fund, 
which will probably replenish by bor-
rowing more money, Social Security 
depletes in about 11 years. I say that 
because nobody here talks about it, 
and it wouldn’t be that difficult to 
solve. 
In the real world, you make the 
tough decisions, you get through it, 
and you are better off for it when you 
get that behind you. 
So I am going to leave it there this 
evening. I am going to ask all of my 
colleagues to please vote on a balanced 
budget amendment that makes it so 
easy that it just says your resolution 
that you bring up each year—you have 
got to do it, you have got to do it on 
time—has to balance the budget in 10 
years. That even gives a lot more lati-
tude than what I really thought was 
necessary, but I also want to make it 
to where every one of us can say yes to 
a balanced budget amendment like this 
because we owe it to our kids and our 
grandkids. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-

which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 6617) making further con-
tinuing appropriations for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2022, and for other pur-
poses. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

AMENDMENT NO. 4929 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call up my 
amendment No. 4929, and ask that it be 
reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Utah [Mr. LEE], for him-
self and Mr. MARSHALL, proposes an amend-
ment numbered 4929. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To prohibit funding for COVID–19 
vaccine mandates) 
After section 101 in division A, insert the 
following: 
SEC. 102. None of the funds appropriated or 
otherwise made available under the Con-
tinuing Appropriations Act, 2022 (division A 
of Public Law 117–43), as amended by this 
Act, may be obligated or expended to— 
(1) implement or enforce— 
(A) section 1910.501 of title 29, Code of Fed-
eral Regulations (or a successor regulation); 
(B) Executive Order 14042 of September 9, 
2021 (86 Fed. Reg. 50985; relating to ensuring 
adequate COVID safety protocols for Federal 
contractors); 
(C) Executive Order 14043 of September 9, 
2021 (86 Fed. Reg. 50989; relating to requiring 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccination for 
Federal employees); 
(D) the interim final rule issued by the De-
partment of Health and Human Services on 
November 5, 2021, entitled ‘‘Medicare and 
Medicaid 
Programs; 
Omnibus 
COVID-19 
Health Care Staff Vaccination’’ (86 Fed. Reg. 
61555); or 
(E) the memorandum signed by the Sec-
retary of Defense on August 24, 2021, for 
‘‘Mandatory Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vac-
cination of Department of Defense Service 
Members’’; or 
(2) promulgate, implement, or enforce any 
rule, regulation, or other agency statement, 
that is substantially similar to a regulation, 
Executive Order, rule, or memorandum de-
scribed in paragraph (1). 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, vaccine 
mandates are morally wrong and wide-
ly unpopular. Millions of Americans 
are still required by this Federal man-
date to be vaccinated or lose their job. 
The people’s elected lawmakers here 
in Congress haven’t instituted these 
mandates. No, there is no Federal law 
putting them in place. President Biden 
and his bureaucrats are just treading 
deeply 
into 
the 
personal 
medical 
choices of Americans without an act of 
Congress authorizing them to do so. 
Now, Congress has the chance to 
make these millions of voices across 
America be heard. That is, after all, 
our job. Our sole job is to make Federal 
law, to give voice to those who elected 
us. We can state clearly, boldly, deci-
sively today that Federal vaccine man-
dates do not belong in the United 
States of America. 
We can stand for millions of vulner-
able Americans who just want to go to 
work so that they have the chance sim-
ply to put food on the table for their 
families. That is not too much to ask. 
The pandemic is waning, but it is 
waning just as our economic problems 
are just beginning. If we want to con-
trol the high price of everything, the 
lack of availability that comes with 
the related supply chain crisis, and 
keep the American economy moving, 
we must stand against these illegal, 
immoral, and unconstitutional man-
dates. 
Look, the American people are sick 
and tired of the Federal Government 
micromanaging every minute detail of 
their lives. They are exhausted from 
the mandates and from the bureaucrats 
who they didn’t vote for and never 
could vote for and never would vote 
for. 
The brave men and women of our 
military, the Federal workers, the Fed-
eral contractors, people who work for 
Federal contractors—even a subdivi-
sion of a Federal contractor that 
doesn’t actually provide any Federal 
contract work—along with medical 
professionals—all these workers across 
every part of our great land who are 
sucked up into this mandate, they all 
deserve better than pink slips and 
boots out the door, simply for making 
their own medical choices. 
So I implore my colleagues with all 
the urgency I am capable of commu-
nicating, to stand up for American 
workers, stand up for our economy, 
stand up for freedom, and vote to with-
hold funding from these unconstitu-
tional mandates. 
It is quite significant that the very 
first clause of the very first section of 
the very first article of the Constitu-
tion says that ‘‘all legislative Powers 
herein granted shall be vested in the 
Congress of the United States, which 
shall consist of a Senate and a House of 
Representatives.’’ 
It matters that this clause comes 
first, before everything else. And the 
reason it matters is because it is there 
to remind us of something. The most 
dangerous power within our Federal 
Government is not with the judiciary, 
it is not with the executive branch; it 
is right here in this branch because we 
have the power to prescribe law. We 
have the power within our Federal 
Government to provide what should be, 
what the law says, what people have to 
do. That is why the Founding Fathers 
were careful not to entrust it to any 
branch of government other than this 
one, not because those who would oc-
cupy these positions would necessarily 
be any wiser or any brighter or inher-
ently more cautious than everyone 
else, except in one critical respect: 
This is the Federal branch most ac-
countable to the people at the most 
regular intervals. You can fire every 
Member of the House every 2 years. 
You can fire one-third of us every 2 
years. 
We are the branch that is account-
able. That is why we have been given 
the most dangerous power within gov-
ernment, the power to make Federal 
law. How then does this relate to ille-
gal, unconstitutional, immoral, and 
wildly unpopular vaccine mandates? 
Well, it matters because that is an ex-
ercise of Federal law. It is an exercise 
of Federal law that Congress never en-
acted. 
They have arrogated to themselves 
within the executive branch an author-
ity that they do not have based on a 
contrivance, 
based 
on 
a 
tortured, 
butchered manipulation of statutory 
text that doesn’t tell people that they 
have got to choose between getting an 
unwanted medical procedure and unem-
ployment, unemployment in a context 
that 
it 
is 
likely 
to 
lead 
to 
unemployability. And, indeed, it was 
designed to do that. We know that be-
cause those who put these policies in 
place have told us as much. 
Look, everybody has been through a 
lot in the last 2 years—Democrats, Re-
publicans alike. This virus has been no 
respecter of persons, of red States and 
of blue States. Just the same, the 
American people understand that we 
are ready to move on. We are ready to 
not have government dictating every 
aspect of our lives. 
COVID is no excuse for a government 
to do something that is categorically 
immoral. It is no excuse to do some-
thing that we all know is wrong. We 
would never justify anyone in ren-
dering a threat against their friend, 
their neighbor, their employee, that if 
you don’t bow, if you don’t defer to 
Presidential medical orthodoxy, I am 
going to make you lose your job and 
make it impossible for you to put bread 
on the table for your children. No sane, 
moral, decent person would do that. We 
must not allow them to do that. We 
must never allow the executive branch 
of government to exercise authority

that they don’t have because we didn’t 
give it to them and they could never 
have 
it 
because 
the 
Constitution 
doesn’t allow it. 
We have got the chance right now to 
bring together red States and blue 
States alike, because, remember, it is 
not just red States anymore that are 
ditching these kind of draconian meas-
ures within their own State govern-
ment systems. No. It is blue States left 
and right—Michigan, New York, New 
Jersey, Illinois. Many, many more blue 
States are joining the number of red 
States that have made this decision. 
Enough is enough. It is time for us to 
live our lives. I encourage my col-
leagues to vote yes on my amendment, 
No. 4929, and let America work again. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
votes be as follows—LEE, CRUZ, and 
BRAUN—and that upon the disposition 
of the Braun amendment, the Senate 
vote on the passage of the bill, with all 
other provisions of the previous order 
remaining in effect. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Texas. 
AMENDMENT NO. 4927 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment No. 4927 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Texas [Mr. CRUZ] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 4927. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To prohibit the use of Federal 
funding for schools and early childhood de-
velopment facilities that enforce COVID–19 
vaccine mandates on children in order to 
protect the rights of parents to make med-
ical decisions that affect their child) 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. PROHIBITION ON FEDERAL FUNDING 
OF SCHOOLS OR CHILD CARE CEN-
TERS WITH STUDENT COVID–19 VAC-
CINE MANDATES. 
None of the funds made available under 
this Act or an amendment made by this Act 
may be provided or awarded, including by 
way of grant or subgrant, to any State edu-
cational agency, local educational agency, 
public school (including a public charter 
school), private or parochial school, child 
care center, or Head Start facility, that en-
forces any coronavirus SARS–CoV–2 vaccine 
mandate that requires a child or student 
under the age of 19 years to be immunized 
against COVID–19 as a condition of enroll-
ment or in-person attendance at such school, 
center, or facility or to participate in any 
school-based or school-sponsored activities, 
including extracurricular activities. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
to speak in opposition to the abuse of 
power we have seen with vaccine man-
dates. 
Let me say that I emphatically sup-
port Senator LEE’s amendment about 
which he just spoke. 
President Biden’s vaccine mandates 
are illegal. They have, in significant 
part, been struck down by the U.S. Su-
preme Court, and they are abusive. 
When this pandemic began, Senators 
on both sides of the aisle gave pas-
sionate speeches about the heroes in 
our society—about the doctors and 
nurses risking their lives to keep us 
safe. Well, now, under this vaccine 
mandate, Democrats are firing doctors 
and nurses and then complaining that 
we have a shortage of doctors and 
nurses. 
We have heard speeches about the he-
roes of our military men and women, 
and they undoubtedly are heroes. Yet, 
under President Biden’s illegal vaccine 
mandates, this administration is pre-
paring to fire soldiers and sailors and 
airmen and marines. This administra-
tion is preparing to fire Navy SEALs, 
who have spent decades training and 
fighting to defend this Nation, but be-
cause they will not submit to an arbi-
trary and illegal mandate, Democrats 
are preparing to fire them. 
We have heard Members from both 
sides of the aisle give speeches about 
police officers and firefighters—the he-
roes of 9/11—who, on that tragic day, 
ran into the building while it was on 
fire instead out of the building while it 
was on fire. Yet, under these illegal 
vaccine mandates, Democrats are fir-
ing police officers and firefighters. 
We are seeing airline flights canceled 
all over the country. Yet, under these 
illegal vaccine mandates, airline pilots 
and flight attendants and mechanics 
and ticket agents are being fired from 
their jobs. 
Typically, when I fly back and forth 
to Houston, I fly either United Airlines 
or Southwest. United, the company, 
has an arbitrary policy wherein they 
are firing or putting on involuntary 
and unpaid leave any employee who re-
fuses to get the vaccine. United is dif-
ferent from other airlines in that re-
gard. They have done so because they 
want to curry favor with the Biden 
White House because United’s CEO be-
lieves that making Democrats at 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue happy is some-
how in its best interests. 
Without exaggeration, every single 
time I board a United plane, a pilot, a 
flight attendant, a ticket agent pulls 
me aside and says: Thank you. Thank 
you for standing up and fighting for my 
rights. Why the heck won’t my CEO 
fight for my rights? 
We are seeing blue State Governors 
and blue State mayors who realize that 
firing American heroes and forcing 
people to make healthcare decisions 
against their wishes is bad politics. We 
are seeing blue State Governors and 
blue State mayors backing down. Yet I 
fear we will see blue State Democrats 
in the Senate—many of whom are not 
on the ballot, two-thirds of whom are 
not on the ballot this November—be-
lieving they can arbitrarily ignore the 
will of the people. 
Just yesterday, the people of San 
Francisco—bright blue, leftwing San 
Francisco—voted out three members of 
the school board over their arbitrary 
and tyrannical COVID policies that 
shut down schools for a year. The vote 
was nearly 80 percent to throw them 
out. I would note, by the way, that 
their defense was, they said, that ev-
erybody voting against them was a 
White supremacist. These were closet 
Republicans, they said, in San Fran-
cisco. San Francisco voted 85 percent 
for Joe Biden, but apparently there are 
a bunch of closet Republicans there. 
My Democratic colleagues are ignor-
ing the will of the people and giving in 
to 
extreme 
partisan 
positions 
on 
COVID. 
Any 
Democrat, 
particularly 
any 
Democrat on the ballot in November, 
ought to look to San Francisco, ought 
to look to the Virginia Governor’s 
race, ought to look to the New Jersey 
Governor’s race and realize the Demo-
cratic Party is out of step with the 
American people. 
Senator LEE’s amendment repeals 
the illegal and abusive vaccine man-
dates from President Biden. 
My amendment is focused on an area 
that people, understandably, rightly, 
are deeply passionate about, which is 
stopping the vaccine mandates on chil-
dren. 
We have seen jurisdictions all over 
the country impose vaccine mandates 
and say to parents: If you want your 
child to go to school, either give the 
child the vaccine or you can’t send 
your kid to school. 
That is an absolute abuse of power. 
The choice of the healthcare your kid 
gets ought to be the choice of the par-
ents. If you want to vaccinate your 
children, that ought to be your choice; 
you ought to have the right. Yet we are 
seeing arrogant blue State Democrats 
across the country say to moms and 
dads: I don’t care what your views are. 
Indeed, the Democratic candidate for 
Governor of Virginia said quite bra-
zenly: Parents should have no say in 
what is taught to their kids. 
By the way, this is applying to chil-
dren as young as 5 years old. We are, 
right now, in the District of Columbia. 
If a Member of Congress has children in 
the schools in DC, the District of Co-
lumbia is mandating you must vac-
cinate your 5-year-old whether you 
want to or not. 
That is wrong. 
My amendment is very simple. It 
cuts off Federal funds for any institu-
tion that forces a vaccine mandate on 
kids. There are nearly 81 million kids 
in America whose rights are in jeop-
ardy. 
The arrogance of these petty authori-
tarians’ at-a-time-of-crisis character is 
revealed, and we are seeing petty au-
thoritarians who say: Mom, you don’t 
have the right to decide whether or not 
your 5-year-old, your 6-year-old, your 
7-year-old will get this vaccine. 
Who the heck do they think they 
are? 
I repeat: If you want to vaccinate 
your kids, that is your right, and you

should do so, but these petty tyrants 
have no right to force parents to vac-
cinate children with a new and untest-
ed vaccine. 
Let me be clear. I am vaccinated—I 
am pro-vaccine—but I believe in indi-
vidual choice. If you want to be vac-
cinated, fantastic, but it ought to be 
your choice in consultation with your 
doctor, and if you have kids, you ought 
to talk to your doctor and say: Hey, 
Doc, what does the evidence show 
about the impact on kids? You ought 
to have a real and candid conversation 
with your doctor, not with some polit-
ical bureaucrat in Washington, DC, or 
in the State capitol or at city hall. 
These mandates are wrong. They are 
wrong in every capacity but especially 
as it concerns kids. 
I say to the petty tyrants—the same 
people, by the way, who shut down 
schools for a year. I mentioned a sec-
ond ago the San Francisco school 
board. One of the school board mem-
bers voted out by nearly 80 percent of 
the voters in San Francisco said—and I 
mentioned this—the people who voted 
against me and the people who want to 
open schools are White supremacists. 
The millions of kids who have been 
hurt by school closures will be aca-
demically behind for the rest of their 
lives, and that harm has fallen dis-
proportionately on low-income kids. It 
has fallen disproportionately on Afri-
can-American kids. It has fallen dis-
proportionately on Hispanic kids, and 
we have got a bunch of rich, White lib-
erals saying to low-income minority 
kids: Well, tough luck. You don’t get to 
go to school. 
Mind you, many of those rich, White 
liberals can afford to send their kids to 
private schools so their kids keep get-
ting educated, but the low-income kids 
are out of luck. 
Then, in this ‘‘Alice in Wonderland’’ 
world we live in, arrogant leftists say: 
If you want schools open—if you want 
African-American kids and Hispanic 
kids to be able to go to school and 
learn to read and learn to write and 
learn math and history and science and 
art and climb the economic ladder and 
have a chance at the American dream— 
and if you want minority kids to have 
a chance to succeed, you are a White 
supremacist. 
Anyone listening to those words un-
derstands why the American people are 
angry. 
I pray that, in just a few minutes, the 
Senate does the right thing and ration-
al thing. These votes, in any sane 
world, should be 100 to nothing. We 
should stand for people’s individual 
rights, individual liberties. We should 
stand against petty tyrants trampling 
on our rights. In just a few minutes, we 
will see where every Senator in this 
body stands. I pray that we stand with 
the people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
AMENDMENT NO. 4929 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak against the Lee amendment, 
which we will be voting on in just a 
minute. 
We are working to rebuild our econ-
omy, and we are working to end a pan-
demic that has killed over 900,000 peo-
ple. So why are a few Senate Repub-
licans, once again, risking a govern-
ment shutdown and creating problems 
rather than trying to work with us on 
the ones that our country already 
faces? 
This is not the first time I have had 
to point out to a handful of Senate Re-
publicans that shutting down the gov-
ernment in the middle of a pandemic is 
a bad idea. It should be obvious, but 
here I am, once again, because my col-
leagues are here, once again, pre-
tending that the biggest threat to our 
Nation is not the virus but, instead, 
vaccines and tests and masks, which 
have helped to actually save lives. This 
makes about as much sense as blaming 
the rescue crew for a shipwreck and 
threatening to sink the lifeboat unless 
they don’t stop helping. 
We all want this pandemic to end; we 
want our schools to stay open safely; 
and we want people to be able to go to 
work safely and go about their lives 
like before. 
We are making real progress toward 
the goal of putting this pandemic be-
hind us. One way to continue this 
progress is to do what the vast major-
ity of Senators—Democrat and Repub-
lican—are prepared to do: vote to keep 
the government open so we can work 
together on funding the Nation’s prior-
ities through regular order. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
against this completely unnecessary 
amendment, 
against 
a 
government 
shutdown, and for common sense. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
AMENDMENT NO. 4927 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak in opposition to Senator CRUZ’s 
amendment, No. 4927. 
Everyone in this body who attended 
school in the United States had to get 
vaccines to attend school—measles, 
mumps, rubella, polio, chickenpox. Ev-
eryone in this body who sent a child to 
school in the United States had to 
make sure that they got their children 
vaccinated. 
Is that because of a big Federal man-
date? No. 
All 50 States—Utah, Texas, New 
York, Maine, Washington, Rhode Is-
land, 
Wisconsin, 
Virginia—embraced 
their own vaccine mandates—all 50. 
There 
are 
some 
variations. 
Iowa 
doesn’t mandate a mumps vaccine, and 
Virginia 
mandates 
a 
human 
papillomavirus vaccine, but we leave it 
up to local school boards and State su-
perintendents of instruction to decide 
if a vaccine is warranted. 
This is unprecedented in this body, 
an effort by the Federal Government to 
force local school boards and State su-
perintendents of instruction to not 
have a vaccine mandate at the cost of 
taking money away from the students 
and the teachers and the parents. 
In Virginia, parents very strongly 
support vaccination of children. Why 
would we not listen to parents? Why 
would we not listen to the local school 
boards that are hearing from parents 
about this? 
I urge my colleagues to reject a mas-
sive Federal overreach that would 
disempower school boards and States 
and take funding away from their chil-
dren’s education. 
Please vote no on the Cruz amend-
ment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the Amer-
ican people do not want a Federal vac-
cine mandate. The American people 
just want to be able to go about doing 
their jobs. They want to be able to go 
work. They don’t want to be told by 
someone who lacks the authority that 
they have to choose between an un-
wanted medical procedure on the one 
hand and on the other hand, losing 
their ability to put bread on the table. 
It is not just illegal; it is not just im-
moral; it is wrong. We all know it is 
wrong, and we know that it is time to 
end this. 
Please vote yes on my amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that all remaining 
time be yielded back before the Lee 
and Cruz amendment votes and that 
the Senate now vote in relation to the 
Lee amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 4929 
Under the previous order, the ques-
tion occurs on agreeing to amendment 
No. 4929, offered by the Senator from 
Utah, Mr. LEE. 
Mr. LEE. I ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll.

poses an amendment numbered 4930. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To strike the Statutory PAYGO 
exemption and require balanced budgets in 
concurrent resolutions on the budget) 
On page 8, strike lines 3 through 6 and in-
sert the following: 
(a) POINT OF ORDER AGAINST BUDGET RESO-
LUTIONS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE A BALANCED 
BUDGET.— 
(1) POINT
OF
ORDER.—It shall not be in 
order in the Senate to consider a concurrent 
resolution on the budget that does not re-
duce the deficit to zero on or before the end 
of the 9th fiscal year after the budget year. 
(2) WAIVER
AND
APPEAL.—Paragraph (1) 
may be waived or suspended in the Senate 
only by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of 
the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An af-
firmative vote of two-thirds of the Members 
of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall 
be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling 
of the Chair on a point of order raised under 
paragraph (1). 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, there will be 2 min-
utes of debate equally divided prior to 
a vote on amendment No. 4932, offered 
by the Senator from Indiana, Mr. 
BRAUN. 
There are 2 minutes of debate. 
Mr. BRAUN. I came here 3 years ago 
with a mission to rein in debt and defi-
cits. I think few of us actually care 
much about that here, in my observa-
tion. If we did, we wouldn’t be passing 
our third short-term spending measure 
in 5 months. It should have been done 
last year. 
In a few weeks, we will pass an Omni-
bus bill that we will all say was bipar-
tisan, and we will go on down the road. 
Meanwhile, inflation will be surging 
ahead—7 percent, 8 percent—the high-
est since 1982. The last time we voted 
on a balanced budget amendment was 
in 2011. By the way, both Democrats 
and Republicans supported it back 
then. 
I am proposing something very sim-
ple, very low-threshold. It creates a 
point of order against any budget reso-
lution that doesn’t reach a balanced 
budget in 10 years. That is so simple, 
everyone, including the Presiding Offi-
cer banging the gavel, ought to be for 
it for the sake of our kids and our 
grandkids. 
Mr. 
LEAHY. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
amendment offered by the Senator 
from Indiana would mandate extreme, 
across the board cuts to Federal pro-
grams that the American people rely 
on. 
Under 
this 
amendment, 
Congress 
would need to callously slash $1.4 tril-
lion in a vain effort to close the budget 
deficit through spending cuts in the 
10th year of a budget resolution. 
Spread evenly across all Federal pro-
grams, this would result in a $350 bil-
lion cut to Medicare, a $180 billion cut 
to Medicaid, and an $82 billion cut to 
veterans’ programs, in just 1 year. 
Nutrition programs that help fami-
lies make ends meet by putting food on 
the table would be slashed by a quar-
ter. Affordable housing, healthcare, 
education, name the Federal program 
that people in your communities rely 
on, and it will be cut by a quarter. 
The Senator’s amendment would re-
quire a two-thirds vote to pass any 
budget resolution that does not bal-
ance the budget in the 10th year. The 
last two budget resolutions written by 
Senate Republicans would have vio-
lated this rule. 
Being responsible stewards of Ameri-
cans’ hard-earned tax dollars is a bipar-
tisan priority, but this is not respon-
sible stewardship. I urge a no vote. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does 
anybody yield back in opposition? 
Mrs. MURRAY. I yield back our 
time. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator yields back time. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 4930 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
question is on adoption of the amend-
ment by the Senator from Indiana (Mr. 
BRAUN). 
Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is 
there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from California (Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. 
KELLY), the Senator from New Mexico 
(Mr. LUJA´ N), and the Senator from Ne-
vada (Mr. ROSEN) are necessarily ab-

NOMINATION OF MICHELE TAYLOR 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, earlier 
this afternoon, I made it clear I was 
going to put forward a unanimous con-
sent request asking the Senate to take 
up and approve the nomination of 
Michele Taylor, to serve as the U.S. 
Representative 
to 
the 
UN 
Human 
Rights Council with the rank of Am-
bassador, and in just a minute and a 
half or so, I will make that unanimous 
consent request. 
Ms. Taylor has an exceptional record 
with respect to humanitarian issues. 
She has served on the Anti-Defamation 
League, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial 
Council. She has been a strong advo-
cate for the rights of women. 
I come from a family who lost rel-
atives in the Holocaust. Ms. Taylor is 
the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. 
And it is absolutely essential that we 
up the ante in the fight against anti- 
Semitism, and that is a key part of 
this country’s diplomacy. 
The reason that I am making this 
unanimous consent tonight is that 
Michele 
Taylor 
is 
unquestionably 
qualified for this important post, but 
there is a real time sensitivity to her 
nomination being cleared tonight. The 
regular session of the U.N. Human 
Rights Council begins on February 28, 
obviously just a few days away. It is 
absolutely essential that we confirm 
our representative now. Delaying Ms. 
Taylor’s confirmation would obviously 
hinder the U.S. ability to advocate for 
American values and help vulnerable 
people who suffer under abuse and op-
pression around the world. And she will 
be able to build on some particularly 
important work that is going on in the 
Senate Committee on Finance, led by 
Senator BROWN
and Senator CRAPO, 
working, for example, on forced labor 
and other issues that involve critically 
important human rights questions. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following nomination: Cal-
endar No. 640, Michele Taylor, of Geor-
gia, for the rank of Ambassador during 
her tenure of service as United States 
Representative 
to 
the 
UN 
Human 
Rights Council; that the Senate vote 
on the nomination without any inter-
vening action or debate; that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate; that any 
statements related to the nomination 
be printed in the Record; that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the nomination. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Michele Taylor, 
of Georgia, for the rank of Ambassador 
during her tenure of service as United 
States 
Representative 
to 
the 
UN 
Human Rights Council. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to 
consider the nomination. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Taylor nomination? 
The nomination was confirmed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has 
been a busy and productive work period 
in the Senate. 
First, the good news is that we have 
kept the government open. It took 
some work, especially when the Senate 
rules lend themselves to delay and ob-
struction. 
Still, 
I 
thank 
Senators 
LEAHY and SHELBY, as well as Leader 
MCCONNELL, for helping us get this 
done. To have allowed the government 
to close would have caused undue hard-
ship for millions of blameless Ameri-
cans. 
We have gotten other things done, 
too, in this work period. 
We passed forced arbitration reform, 
made progress to fix our post office, 
and confirmed more of the President’s 
nominees.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S780 
February 17, 2022 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. President, next session, we are 
picking up right where we left off, to 
pass postal reform so we can send it to 
the President’s desk. 
I have also taken the first procedural 
step for the Senate to consider the 
Women’s 
Health 
Protection 
Act. 
Across the country, the assault on 
women’s healthcare has intensified to 
levels not seen in decades. So the Sen-
ate is going to vote, when we return on 
February 28, to take action. 
Democrats will also continue focus-
ing on lowering costs for everyday 
Americans, including by taking aim at 
the costs of insulin. It is just prepos-
terous—beyond 
preposterous—that 
Americans with diabetes sometimes 
pay more than $600 just for a 40-day 
supply of insulin. So my colleague Sen-
ator WARNOCK has introduced legisla-
tion that will cap insulin costs to just 
$35 a month. 
There is enormous interest in our 
caucus to pursue this proposal, so it 
will be a priority for Democrats in the 
weeks ahead. This has long been a bi-
partisan issue. As many as 20 States 
across the country, many with Repub-
lican legislatures and Governors, have 
passed State-level insulin caps. There 
is no reason this shouldn’t be bipar-
tisan in this body, and I invite my Re-
publican colleagues to join us in this 
effort. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session and be in 
a period of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak for up to 10 
minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
UKRAINE 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of my resolution 
to convey strong bipartisan opposition 
to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s 
unprovoked 
aggression 
against 
the 
United States’ partner, Ukraine. I was 
proud to lead this resolution with Sen-
ator ROB PORTMAN, in addition to Sen-
ators DURBIN, CORNYN, MENENDEZ, and 
RISCH, and was pleased to see 38 Sen-
ators join this resolution and push for 
its passage. 
As the Senate prepared to adjourn for 
the next week, Senator PORTMAN and I 
believed it was absolutely critical that 
we deliver this message of strong bipar-
tisan support for the brave and resil-
ient people of Ukraine. It is important 
to send a message of bipartisan resolve 
and to stand up to Putin in response to 
his continued aggression and especially 
given recent indications that he is in-
creasingly likely to eschew the diplo-
matic path available and further in-
vade Ukraine. And as I join a large bi-
partisan delegation to the Munich Se-
curity Forum this weekend, lawmakers 
on both sides of the aisle agreed that it 
was paramount that the Senate pass 
this resolution. This resolution dem-
onstrates the fierce bipartisan support 
for the NATO, for the transatlantic al-
liance, for our democratic partners in 
Ukraine and in repudiation of Putin’s 
efforts 
to 
violate 
Ukraine’s 
sov-
ereignty. 
This Senate has a long history of 
supporting an independent and demo-
cratic Ukraine. Since Russia’s initial 
invasion of Ukraine in 2014, this Con-
gress has provided more than $2.7 bil-
lion in security assistance and sup-
ported critical reforms to help Ukraine 
on its journey to greater euro-Atlantic 
integration. 
I am proud to have been involved in 
a number of bipartisan efforts to sup-
port Ukraine. Last month, I traveled to 
Ukraine with Senator PORTMAN as part 
of a bipartisan congressional delega-
tion to meet with Ukrainian President 
Zelenskyy and his national security 
team to discuss the Russian threat and 
how the United States can help our 
Ukrainian friends. In January, I re-
affirmed the United States’ commit-
ment 
to 
our 
democratic 
partners, 
which I also shared during a congres-
sional delegation visit last June, that 
our Nation believes fervently that 
Ukraine and Ukraine alone should de-
termine its future. 
In our meetings, the message from 
the Ukrainians was clear. They see 
their future in partnership with the 
West. They share our democratic val-
ues, and their people are proud of their 
hard-won independence. I would like to 
make one point perfectly clear: The 
unprecedented 
Russian 
threat 
to 
Ukraine’s sovereignty is on Vladimir 
Putin and no one else. He has designed 
this crisis to advance his own revanch-
ist agenda. The global community is 
not blind to his malign ambitions. He 
wants to reconstruct the Soviet Union 
and recreate his own sphere of interest. 
And he—wrongfully—sees Ukraine as 
part of this authoritarian future. 
Putin wants to diminish the U.S. 
presence in Europe and to rewrite the 
European security order for his benefit 
and in blatant disregard for previous 
international agreements and treaties 
that Russia signed. And Putin has 
shown repeated attempts to subvert 
democratic institutions in the United 
States, threaten our election security, 
attack our infrastructure, and com-
promise the sovereignty of our allies 
around the globe. 
This is why what happens in Ukraine 
matters to the United States. How we 
respond to Putin’s aggression against 
Ukraine will have implications for our 
national security and global stability 
for decades to come. It is important 
that we stand up for our values. It is 
necessary that we stand up to protect 
our national security. And it is critical 
that we continue to uphold and protect 
the European security order that has 
afforded us peace and prosperity for 
over 70 years. As Putin tries to dis-
mantle and divide the very alliance 
that has kept us safe for over 70 years, 
it is all the more important that we 
strengthen 
our 
resolve 
through 
a 
strong message of unbreakable unity. 
This is why the passage of today’s bi-
partisan resolution on Ukraine is so 
important. I want to covey my appre-
ciation to Senator PORTMAN
for his 
work and leadership. Especially on this 
issue, we believe that bipartisanship is 
critical in advancing U.S. foreign pol-
icy, especially in support of our part-
ner, Ukraine. And we must lead by ex-
ample and convey, as we have done to 
our Ukrainian partners and our trans-
atlantic allies, that we must not leave 
any space for Putin to sow further dis-
cord. 
On Monday, I spoke on the floor and 
said that the Senate does not have a 
choice; we must send a message of 
strong, unequivocal bipartisan resolve. 
And today, we did just that. 
Along with my fellow Senators, I 
wish to send an unequivocal message to 
Putin; you will not divide this Senate. 
You will not divide this country. And 
you will not divide the transatlantic 
alliance. Diplomacy remains an option 
to deescalate this situation and pursue 
a peaceful resolution. But if Putin de-
cides to further invade Ukraine, he will 
only succeed in uniting us all—Demo-
crats, Republicans, Americans, and the 
transatlantic alliance—in sending a 
message 
of 
unmistakable 
resolve 
against his belligerence.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
section 36(b) of the Arms Export Con-
trol Act requires that Congress receive 
prior notification of certain proposed 
arms sales as defined by that statute. 
Upon such notification, the Congress 
has 30 calendar days during which the 
sale may be reviewed. The provision 
stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent 
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
DEFENSE SECURITY 
COOPERATION AGENCY, 
Arlington, VA. 
Hon. ROBERT MENENDEZ, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Pursuant to the re-
porting requirements of Section 36(b)(5)(A) of

Director. 
Enclosures. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 0B–22 
Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensi-
tivity of Technology or Capability (Sec. 
36(b)(5)(A), AECA) 
(i) Purchaser: Government of Croatia. 
(ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 
19–72; Date: October 30, 2019; Military Depart-
ment: Army. 
Funding Source: National Funds. 
(iii) Description: On October 30, 2019, Con-
gress was notified by Congressional certifi-
cation transmittal number 19–72 of the pos-
sible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms 
Export Control Act, of two (2) UH–60M Black 
Hawk Helicopters in standard USG configu-
ration with designated unique equipment 
and 
Government 
Furnished 
Equipment 
(GFE), up to nine (9) each T700–GE–70 ID en-
gines, and up to nine (9) each H–764GU/Em-
bedded Global Positioning/Inertial Naviga-
tion (EGI). Also included was Communica-
tion Security equipment including an AN/ 
APX–123A Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) 
transponder, AN/ARC–201D RT–1478D, and 
AN/ARC–231 RT–1808A radios, aircraft war-
ranty, air worthiness support, calibration 
services, spare and repair parts, support 
equipment, 
communication 
equipment, 
weapons, ammunition, night vision devices, 
publications and technical documentation, 
personnel training and training devices, site 
surveys, tool and test equipment, U.S. Gov-
ernment and contractor technical and logis-
tics support services, and other related ele-
ments of logistical and program support. The 
estimated total cost was $115 million. Major 
Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $60 
million of this total. 
This transmittal reports the inclusion of 
additional non-MDE articles that were not 
previously notified: AN/ARC–201D RT–1478D 
radios. The total estimated non-MDE value 
will increase by $.07 million. The total esti-
mated MDE value will remain $60 million. 
The total estimated case value will increase 
to $115.07 million. 
(iv) Significance: The proposed sale of de-
fense articles and services supports Croatia’s 
ongoing modernization of its ageing fleet of 
Mi-8 helicopters and transition to NATO 
specification transport helicopters. This will 
contribute to Croatia’s effort to update their 
capabilities and enhance interoperability 
with NATO allies. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity of the United States by improving the 
security of a NATO Ally that continues to be 
an important force for political stability and 
economic progress in Europe. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensi-
tivity of Technology statement contained in 
the original notification applies to items re-
ported here. 
The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is UNCLASSI-
FIED. 
(vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: 
February 16, 2022.

TRANSMITTAL NO. 22–20 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams Tank: The M1A2 
Abrams is a third-generation American main 
battle tank, produced by General Dynamics 
Land 
Systems 
and 
named 
for 
General 
Creighton Abrams. The M1A2 SEPv3 (System 
Enhancement Package version 3) features in-
clude a multi-fuel turbine engine, composite 
armor, an advanced computer fire control 
system, separate ammunition storage in a 
blow-out compartment, and 120mm main 
gun. Extensive improvements have been in-
tegrated into the latest M1A2 SEPv3 configu-
ration. These improvements include im-
proved digital systems, increased electrical 
power margin to support demands of future 
technologies, 
line 
replaceable 
modules 
(LRM) to reduce operational support costs, 
ammunition data link to support new tank 
main gun rounds, and an auxiliary power 
unit (APU). M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tank com-
ponents considered to contain sensitive tech-
nology in the proposed sale are as follows: 
a. Thermal Imaging System (TIS) and 
Commander’s Independent Thermal Viewer 
(CITV): 
(1) The TIS and CITV constitutes a target 
acquisition system which, when operated 
with other tank systems gives the tank crew 
a substantial advantage over the potential 
threat. 
(2) The TIS provides the Abrams M1A2 
crew with the ability to effectively aim and 
fire the tank main armament system under a 
broad range of adverse battlefield conditions. 
The TIS can be operated and viewed by the 
tank gunner or tank commander, and is the 
main sighting system for the tanks’ main 
gun (cannon). The CITV provides the same 
target acquisition system as the TIS, but 
provides the tank commander a separate sys-
tem that can be controlled and operated 
independent of the TIS. 
b. Armor: Major components of the armor 
are fabricated and assembled into serialized 
removable subassemblies, and installed in 
sealed modules. 
c. 120mm Main Gun (Cannon) & M256 Gun 
Barrel: The Abrams 120mm main gun system 
is composed of a 120 millimeter (mm) 
smoothbore gun (cannon) also referred to as 
the 
M256 
gun 
barrel, 
manufactured 
at 
Watervliet Arsenal; armor-piercing, fin sta-
bilized, discarded sabot (APFSDS) and other 
warheads; and combustible cartridge case 
ammunition. 
d. AGT–1500 Gas Turbine Propulsion Sys-
tem: The use of AGT–1500 gas turbine propul-
sion system in the M1A2 is a unique applica-
tion of armored vehicle power pack tech-
nology. The hardware is composed of the 
AGT–1500 engine and transmission and is not 
classified. Manufacturing processes associ-
ated with the production of turbine blades, 
recuperator, bearings and shafts, and hydro-
static pump and motor are proprietary and 
therefore commercially competition sen-
sitive. 
e. Common Remotely Operated Weapon 
Station—Low 
Profile 
(CROWS–LP): 
The 
CROWS–LP (M153A2E1) is a commander’s 
weapon station. It allows for operation of 
weapons—M2HB, M2A1, M240B and M240 ma-
chine guns. The CROWS–LP is an updated 
version of the M153A2 CROWS. The CROWS– 
LP M153A2E1 has improved performance over 
the M153A2. 
f. Ammunition Data Link (ADL): The Am-
munition Data Link (ADL) is a system con-
sisting of hardware, electronics, software 
and an upgraded fire control system. The 
ADL is required to effectively fire the latest 
generation of ‘‘smart’’ 120mm main gun am-
munition. The ADL offers the capability to 
supply data to the main gun ammunition to 
increase the capability and effectiveness of 
the smart round. The Advanced Multipur-
pose (AMP) smart round requires the ADL to 
function, and is a future enhancement for 
use with the M1A2 Abrams. 
g. Driver Vision Enhancer—Abrams (DVE– 
A) AN/VAS–5 and Rear View Sensor System 
(RVSS): 
(1) 
The 
AN/VAS–5 
Driver 
Vision 
Enhancer—Abrams (DVE–A) and Rear View 
Sensor System (RVSS) are thermal imaging 
systems developed for use while driving com-
bat vehicles and tactical wheeled vehicles. 
The DVE-A provides night vision capability 
for the Abrams tank driver. RVSS provides a 
rear view camera for the Abrams tank. 
(2) DVE–A and RVSS allow for tactical ve-
hicle movement in support of operational 
missions in all environmental conditions 
(day/night and all weather) and provides en-
hanced driving capability during limited vis-
ibility conditions (darkness, smoke, dust, 
fog, etc.). 
h. Global Positioning System (GPS) AN/ 
PSN–13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver 
(DAGR): Global Positioning System (GPS) 
capability is currently provided to Abrams 
tanks using the DAGR. The DAGR is a 
handheld GPS receiver which utilizes Selec-
tive 
Availability 
Anti-Spoofing 
Module 
(SAASM) security. It is used for the Abrams 
tank, the M88A2 HERCULES Recovery Vehi-
cle and the Joint Assault Bridge. 
i. Handheld Communication Radio AN/ 
PRC–158: The AN/PRC–158 is a multiband 
handheld radio. It is a portable, compact, 
tactical software-defined combat-net radio 
manufactured by L3/Harris Corporation. It is 
also referred to as the AN/PRC–158 Multi- 
Channel Manpack Radio System. The AN/ 
PRC–158 has been fielded since 2005 by the 
U.S. Army, the USMC, and various select 
countries. It is used for the Abrams tank, the 
M88A2 HERCULES Recovery Vehicle and the 
Joint Assault Bridge. 
j. Battle Management System (BMS): The 
BMS for the Poland SEPv3 tank will consist 
of a Data Distribution Unit—Expandable 
(DDUx), a transceiver, and commercial soft-
ware called Sitaware. It equips soldiers with 
secure data encryption and advanced logis-
tics. It includes an intuitive interface with 
features like touch-to-zoom maps and drag- 
and-drop icons. It is used for the Abrams 
tank, the M88A2 HERCULES Recovery Vehi-
cle and the Joint Assault Bridge. 
k. Counter Remote Controlled Improvised 
Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic War-
fare (CREW) Duke AN/VLQ–12: The AN/VLQ– 
12 CREW Duke system is a vehicle-mounted, 
lightweight system that neutralizes RCIED 
threats and gives troops a tactical advantage 
across the full spectrum of operations. It is 
the U.S. Army’s state-of-the-art security en-
hancement to the U.S. Army Abrams tank. 
The AN/VLQ–12 CREW Duke system uses an 
advanced software-defined architecture that 
supports rapid reconfiguration to adapt to 
the constantly evolving threat environment. 
2. M88A2 HERCULES Recovery Vehicle: 
The primary role of the M88A2 Heavy Equip-
ment Recovery Combat Utility Lifting Ex-
traction System (HERCULES) Combat Re-
covery Vehicle is recovery of the Abrams M1 
Main Battle Tank. The 70–ton M88A2 Recov-
ery Combat Vehicle is standard equipment to 
de-process, recover, and sustain the Abrams 
M1 Tank. The vehicle’s role is to extricate 
combat vehicles that have become bogged 
down or entangled; and to repair or replace 
damaged parts in fighting vehicles while 
under fire. The M88A2 main winch is capable 
of 70–ton single line recovery; and a 140–ton 
2:1 recovery when used with a 140–ton pulley. 
The A-frame boom of the M88A2 can lift 35 
tons when used in conjunction with the 
spade down. The spade can be used for light 
earth moving and to anchor the vehicle when 
using the main winch. The M88A2 employs 
an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) to provide 
auxiliary electrical and hydraulic power 
when the main engine is not in operation; 
the APU can also be used to slave start other 
vehicles. The M88A2 recovery vehicle compo-
nents considered to contain sensitive tech-
nology in the proposed case are as follows: 
a. AVDS–1790–8CR Engine Propulsion Sys-
tem: The AVDS–1790–8CR is a unique modi-
fication to the standard piston engine family 
in the M60 series and the base M88Al. 
b. Driver’s Vision Enhancer (DVE–CV M88): 
Driver’s Vision Enhancer (DVE–CV M88) is a 
thermal imaging system developed for use 
while driving Combat Vehicles (CVs) and 
Tactical Wheeled Vehicles (TWVs). It allows 
for tactical vehicle movement in support of 
operational missions in all environmental 
conditions (day/night and all weather) and 
provides enhanced driving capability during 
limited 
visibility 
conditions 
(darkness, 
smoke, dust, fog, etc). The DVE provides 
night vision targeting capabilities for ar-
mored vehicles and long-range night vision 
reconnaissance capability to the warfighter. 
The DVE–CV for M88 vehicle is a platform- 
mounted night vision device (not man-port-
able), requires external power supply and is 
integrated into the vehicle. 
3. M1110 Joint Assault Bridge: The M1110 
Joint Assault Bridge (JAB) is a fully tracked 
armor engineer vehicle specifically designed 
to replace the M48/M60 AVLB, M104 Wol-
verine HAB and provide assault bridging ca-
pabilities to armored forces. The JAB Sys-
tem consists of an M1A1 Abrams chassis 
(with A2 heavy suspension) and a hydraulic 
bridge launch mechanism that will launch 
and retrieve the Heavy Assault Scissor 
Bridge MLC–115 Normal and MLC–124 Cau-
tion. The JAB contains: 
a. Armor: Major components of the armor 
are fabricated and assembled into serialized 
removable subassemblies, and installed in 
sealed modules. 
b. AGT–1500 Gas Turbine Propulsion Sys-
tem: The use of AGT–1500 gas turbine propul-
sion system in the JAB is a unique applica-
tion of armored vehicle power pack tech-
nology. The hardware is composed of the 
AGT–1500 engine and transmission. 
c. Driver Vision Enhancer—JAB (DVE) and 
Rear View Sensor System (RVSS): The Driv-
er Vision Enhancer (DVE) used on the JAB is 
the DVE–10 and Rear View Sensor System 
(RVSS) both are thermal imaging systems 
developed for use while driving combat vehi-
cles and tactical wheeled vehicles. The DVE 
provides night vision capability for the JAB 
driver. The RVSS provides a rear view cam-
era for the JAB. DVE and RVSS allow for 
tactical vehicle movement in support of 
operational missions in all environmental 
conditions (day/night and all weather) and 
provides enhanced driving capability during 
limited 
visibility 
conditions 
(darkness, 
smoke, dust, fog, etc.). 
4. M830A1 120mm High Explosive Anti- 
Tank (HEAT) TP-T Cartridges is a chemical 
energy, multi-purpose projectile with an 
anti-personnel capability. The round consists 
of a fin stabilized steel body which is loaded

RECOGNIZING THE PENSION 
RIGHTS CENTER 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today is 
a doubly special day. February 17 is the 
46th anniversary of the founding of the 
Pension Rights Center. February 17 is 
also the birthday of Karen Ferguson, 
the long-time director of the Pension 
Rights Center, who passed away re-
cently. 
The Pension Rights Center as helmed 
by Ms. Ferguson was known as a tire-
less advocate for the right of workers 
and senior citizens to enjoy a dignified 
and secure retirement. Their passion 
for retirement security is something 
that I have also shared since the 1970s, 
when I helped to found the Oregon 
Gray Panthers, an organization dedi-
cated to improving the lives of senior 
citizens. The support of the Pension 
Rights Center and Ms. Ferguson was 
instrumental in the passage of recent 
legislation such as the Setting Every 
Community Up for Retirement En-
hancement Act of 2019 and the finan-
cial assistance program for distressed 
multiemployer pension plans in the 
American Rescue Plan Act. 
On this double anniversary, I urge 
my 
colleagues 
to 
reflect 
on 
the 
progress that has been made so far in 
improving retirement security in the 
United States and to double down in 
our efforts to fight for further improve-
ment.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING KAREN FERGUSON 
∑ Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the life and 
work of Karen Ferguson, the founder 
and president of the Pension Rights 
Center. Karen passed away in Decem-
ber. Today would have been her 81st 
birthday, and today also marks the 
46th anniversary of Karen founding the 
Pension Rights Center. 
Under Karen’s steadfast leadership, 
the Pension Rights Center has been at 
the forefront of ensuring retirement se-
curity for all, from retirees in strug-
gling multiemployer pension plans to 
women obtaining spousal shares of re-
tirement plans to countless individuals 
seeking assistance through one of the 
center’s pension counseling projects. 
The Pension Rights Center was Karen’s 
gift to all of us. 
Karen will be remembered for her 
fierce determination and tireless advo-
cacy on behalf of workers, women, and 
retirees. She also possessed an unparal-
leled depth of knowledge on retirement 
law, a subject many find intimidating. 
The world has lost a pension superhero. 
I salute Karen for her decades of serv-
ice. She will be greatly missed.∑

RECOGNIZING FARM GIRL GIFTS 
AND BAKE SHOP 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, as 
ranking member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Small Business and Entre-
preneurship, each week I recognize an 
outstanding Kentucky small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize Farm Girl Gifts 
and Bake Shop of Corydon, KY, as the 
Senate Small Business of the Week. 
Entrepreneurship is undoubtedly a 
unique career path. I guarantee if you 
ask any small business owner about 
the genesis of their business, you will 
find that each start-up story is distinct 
in its own way. For Farm Girl Gifts 
and Bake Shop, baking had long been a 
hobby of founder and owner, Marganna 
Stanley, who spent the past 30 years 
working as an educator in the schools 
of Henderson County, the last 6 of 
which as Henderson County school su-
perintendent. Though she has always 
been 
passionate 
about 
teaching, 
Marganna did not let her 2020 retire-
ment stop her from chasing her other 
dream, that of owning her own busi-
ness. 
In 
late 
2020, 
undeterred 
by 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Marganna opened 
Farm Girl Gifts and Bake Shop, a place 
where one could shop for gifts of all 
kinds, including glassware, skincare 
and bath products, children’s books 
and toys, along with a host of local ar-
tisan products. Even with the wide 
array of gifts for sale, there are plenty 
of other attractions at Farm Girl, 
namely, the excellent home-cooking of 
Marganna and her staff. As the busi-
ness name would indicate, baked goods 
are her specialty. The team at Farm 
Girl Gifts and Bake Shop work tire-
lessly to ensure that every customer 
has more than enough options to 
choose from. From cookies to layer 
cakes, muffins to pies, sourdough loafs 
to 
her 
signature 
tall 
cupcakes, 
Marganna and her team stay busy in 
the kitchen. 
As the only restaurant in the town of 
Corydon, Marganna makes sure Farm 
Girl always has some hearty Kentucky 
cooking on hand to satisfy any appe-
tite. Though sweets are Marganna’s 
specialty, sub sandwiches, soups, and 
sliders are common attractions at 
Farm Girl Gifts and Bake Shop. More-
over, Marganna brings her experience 
as an educator and her love for teach-
ing to her new business venture. When 
stocking her shelves with Christmas 
gifts for the holidays, she made sure to 
include educational books and toys for 
young children. She keeps the Farm 
Girl atmosphere fun by creating com-
petitions for her devoted customers. In 
the summer of 2021, she announced that 
the customer who bought Farm Girl’s 
10,000th tall cupcake would receive a 
$100 prize. She ended 2021, her first full 
year in business, having sold 9,678 of 
these tall cupcakes. Shortly thereafter 
Farm Girl hit that 10,000 milestone and 
that $100 bill found itself in one lucky 
customer’s pocket. Her effort to bring 
a fun and engaging feeling to her busi-
ness 
harkens 
back 
to 
Marganna’s 
tenured career as an educator. Needless 
to say, his beloved presence in Hender-
son County is still brightening the 
faces of Corydon residents, young and 
old. 
Farm Girl Gifts and Bake Shop is a 
wonderful example of how old passions 
can lead to new adventures. Always a 
great 
steward 
of 
her 
community, 
Marganna did not let a pandemic delay 
or deter her from pursuing her dream 
of serving Henderson County outside of 
the classroom. Always with a friendly 
smile, she continues on as a steadfast 
member of her community, and Hen-
derson County parents and alumni 
alike make sure to stop by Farm Girl 
Gifts and Bake Shop to see her familiar 
face. 
Congratulations to Marganna Stan-
ley and the entire Farm Girl Gifts and 
Bake Shop team. I wish them the best 
of luck and look forward to watching 
their continued growth and success in 
Kentucky.∑

TRIBUTE TO ED LEARY 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize a remarkable 
Utahn who has recently announced his 
retirement after a long career of public 
service to our great State. Ed Leary 
has served honorably as commissioner 
of the Utah Department of Financial 
Institutions—DFI—for the past three 
decades, and his retirement marks the 
conclusion of 45 years at the agency. 
His ascendency through the ranks of 
the agency is a testament to his strong 
character, wealth of knowledge and ex-
pertise, 
and 
impressive 
leadership 
abilities. From first serving as exam-
iner, to industry supervisor and chief 
examiner before his appointment as 
Utah banking commissioner in 1992, Ed 
Leary garnered the necessary experi-
ence to become an indispensable advo-
cate of smart banking policy. 
Ed’s list of accomplishments during 
his tenure is a long one. To name just 
a few, he led his agency’s successful ef-
fort to achieve accreditation of the 
Utah DFI, shepherded the development 
of Utah’s industrial banks community, 
and was instrumental in reforming the 
regulatory environment to improve 
conditions for commerce, bolstering 
Utah’s economic might. By virtue of 
his thoughtful policy advocacy, Ed has 
earned the trust and admiration of 
friends, colleagues, and associates in 
both the public and private sectors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S784 
February 17, 2022 
Thank you, Ed, for your decades of 
impressive service to the great State of 
Utah. You have set a robust example 
for public servants to follow in our fi-
nancial, housing, and banking commu-
nities. We wish you and your family all 
the best in your next chapter.∑

TRIBUTE TO RYAN COCHRAN- 
SIEGLE 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
the State of Vermont is remarkably 
proud of Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who 
won a silver medal at the Winter Olym-
pics in Beijing in the men’s super-G. 
This achievement is specially impres-
sive considering it occurred just 13 
months after Ryan underwent surgery 
to repair a broken neck. His comeback 
is truly remarkable. 
It is not merely his success that 
Vermont honors, but the history of his 
family. Family is important in our 
State, which values community and 
continuity—both of which are em-
bodied in family. Families—people who 
are linked by a shared home life, by a 
closeness to one another, by a mutual 
supportiveness—are at the heart of 
what our small State is about. 
Ryan’s mother, Barbara Ann, won 
the gold medal in Slalom at the Olym-
pics in Sapporo, Japan, in 1972, nearly 
50 years to the day before her son’s 
medal. Barbara Ann was Ryan’s first 
ski teacher, and he learned where she 
did: at the small, family operated, non-
profit Cochran’s Ski Area in Richmond, 
VT, 
Cochran’s was founded by Barbara 
Ann’s parents, Mickey and Ginny Coch-
ran, who were a remarkable pair of 
people. Mickey, who would become the 
alpine director of the U.S. National Ski 
Team, was not himself a champion 
skier, but an engineer and former Uni-
versity of Vermont football player, 
who valued family—and eventually ski-
ing—above all else. Likewise, Ginny 
was dedicated to family and skiing. 
When they first established Cochran’s 
Ski Area, it was a small, backyard op-
eration. Today, it has grown into a 
center where generations of Vermont 
school children could learn to ski, still 
located on the small family hill. 
Ginny and Mickey had four children, 
Barbara Ann, Marilyn, Bob, and Lindy. 
All were champion skiers and made the 
U.S. Olympic Team 
Among their many other sking ac-
complishments, 
Marilyn 
Cochran 
Brown was a national champion three 
times, Bob Cochran was the first Amer-
ican man to win a World Cup in giant 
slalom, and Lindy Cochran Kelley won 
national slalom titles and was All 
American at University of Vermont— 
and, of course, Barbara Ann, Olympic 
slalom gold medalist and two-time na-
tional champion. 
That tradition of family skiing excel-
lence continued into the next genera-
tion, 
Mickey 
and 
Ginny’s 
grand-
children. 
Lindy’s 
children, 
Jessica 
Kelley, Tim Kelley, and Robby Kelley, 
all raced on the U.S. National Ski 
Team and all competed in World Cup 
races. Robby was the U.S. National 
Giant Slalom champion. 
Two of Bob’s children were skiers: 
Jimmy Cochran, who won the U.S. Sla-
lom competition three times and com-
peted in the Olympic games; and Amy 
Cochran, a successful collegiate racer. 
Marilyn’s son Roger Brown was on the 
U.S. Ski Team, winning the 2002 Sla-
lom championship and her son Doug 
Brown was on the varsity ski team at 
St. 
Lawrence 
University. 
Together 
with two of their cousins, Doug and 
Roger have gone on to found another 
Cochran 
family 
business, 
Slopeside 
Syrup and Untapped. And of course, 
Barbara Ann’s son, two-time Olympian 
and one-time silver medalist Ryan 
Cochran-Siegle, who has also also com-
peted in the World Cup. 
Clearly, the impact of the Cochran 
family is not only their world-class 
skiing. Cochran’s Ski Area is a bright 
spot in making skiing accessable and 
fun for all Vermonters. As a nonprofit, 
they welcome children from across the 
region to learn in a safe, judgement- 
free environment where the love of the 
sport is what matters, not the brand of 
your gear. The ‘‘Skiing Cochrans’’ are 
truly a Vermont legacy. 
‘‘Bravo!’’∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING MILLER, SOUTH 
DAKOTA 
∑ Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today 
I wish to honor the Miller School Dis-
trict staff and students, first respond-
ers, and all community members who 
contributed to the successful emer-
gency evacuation of Miller School and 
Hand-in-Hand Daycare. 
On what seemed to be a typical 
morning in Miller, SD, on February 2, 
2022, an explosion and fire suddenly 
took place in the Miller High School. 
A potentially devastating situation 
was thankfully prevented by the swift 
actions of the Miller School District 
teachers 
and 
staff. 
Miller 
super-
intendent Dr. Charlene Crosswait, jun-
ior/senior high school principal Steve 
Schumacher, elementary school prin-
cipal Drake Bachmeier, Mr. Mark 
Ketelhut, and the teachers and staff ef-
ficiently executed the evacuation plan, 
ultimately saving the lives of all 447 
students from kindergarteners through 
the senior graduating class of 2022. 
I would like to commend the teachers 
and staff members for their diligent 
training, emergency preparation plan-
ning, and quick action to lead students 
to safety. I would also like to recognize 
each and every student for their atten-
tiveness and exceptional conduct in an 
emergency situation. Because of the 
rapid response, every child and staff 
member 
made 
it 
out 
safe 
and 
unharmed. I would also like to com-
mend Hand-in-Hand Daycare Center lo-
cated adjacent to the school for safely 
evacuating all staff and children. 
In emergency situations like this, 
while people are moving swiftly to get 
to safety, heroic emergency responders 
are always there running toward the 
blaze. The well-coordinated response 
from Hand County emergency manager 
Arlen 
Gortmaker, 
volunteer 
fire-
fighters from Miller, Ree Heights, and 
Wessington Fire Departments, and first 
responders from Hand County and the 
city of Miller who secured the area and 
extinguished the fire deserve recogni-
tion. The first responders endured 
hours of freezing temperatures, frozen 
pump lines, and weather challenges 
with equipment. These hard-working, 
generous volunteers, and workers have 
big hearts and show up relentlessly 
under all circumstances to ensure the 
safety and well-being of others. Thank 
you to all of our firefighters and first 
responders for all you do. 
In true South Dakota fashion, the en-
tire community pulled together. De-
spite fire and smoke damage, which 
made the school inaccessible, thanks to 
the compassionate generosity of St. 
Ann’s Catholic Church, First United 
Methodist Church, First Presbyterian 
Church, and the Community Church of 
St. Lawrence, students will be able to 
utilize facilities to complete the rest of 
their school year. Sunshine Bible Acad-
emy has offered their gym for Miller 
Rustler basketball team practices and 
games. Communities across South Da-
kota have been reaching out to offer 
support and assistance. I am proud to 
be part of a State that strongly be-
lieves in joining together to help 
friends and neighbors through tough 
times. The buildings need work, but 
they can be repaired. Most impor-
tantly, everyone made it home safely 
to their families and the community 
remains strong and resilient. 
I commend the entire Miller commu-
nity for their excellent response to the 
emergency at the Miller School. The 
true spirit of our State shines brightly 
in Miller, SD.∑

REMEMBERING KAREN FERGUSON 
∑ Ms. WARREN. Madam President, 
today is the birthday of Karen Fer-
guson, a tireless advocate for retire-
ment security, who sadly passed away 
in December. She started a movement 
for improved worker’s rights and better 
pensions. Forty-six years ago today, 
she founded the Pension Rights Center 
in aid of that effort. As recently as this 
past March, Karen’s impact can be seen 
in the passage of the Butch Lewis Act, 
which helps protect the benefits of 
workers and retirees in multiemployers 
plans. We are deeply grateful for 
Karen’s work and can honor her legacy 
by continuing to fight so that everyone 
can retire with dignity and security.∑

sions: 
S. RES. 518 
Whereas there is an urgent need to im-
prove our health care system to better inte-
grate treatment of mental health and sub-
stance use disorders so they are no longer 
seen separately; 
Whereas, according to the World Health 
Organization, mental illness is severely 
underdiagnosed, and less than half of individ-
uals who meet diagnostic criteria are identi-
fied; 
Whereas there is a pressing need to provide 
a comprehensive solution to fix our health 
care system that incorporates the needs and 
expertise of all its stakeholders, especially 
individuals who have expertise in mental 
health and substance use disorders; 
Whereas it is essential to remove the mis-
guided association between mental illness 
and violence, driven by fear and misunder-
standing; 
Whereas mental illness and substance use 
disorders have been underresearched, under-
treated, and overstigmatized; 
Whereas stigma, vilification, and dismissal 
of mental illness and substance use— 
(1) create a culture that— 
(A) discourages utilization of mental 
health and substance use disorder services; 
and 
(B) lacks acknowledgment that strug-
gling with a mental health condition or 
substance use disorder is not something to 
be ashamed of; and 
(2) can vary in prominence in different cul-
tures and communities, and are particularly 
high among communities of color and minor-
ity communities; 
Whereas men, in particular, face cultural 
and societal barriers to seeking treatment 
for mental health concerns and substance 
use disorders, which can contribute to con-
cerning outcomes including suicide and ag-
gressive behavior; 
Whereas the bulk of mental health and 
substance use disorder services are reactive 
instead of proactive, treating patients when 
they are in crisis instead of incorporating 
services and screening earlier in an attempt 
to prevent such crises; 
Whereas there is a need to increase access 
to treatment, services, and social supports 
for everyone to proactively address the root 
causes of mental illness and substance use 
disorders; 
Whereas it is necessary to address the root 
causes of mental health concerns and sub-
stance use disorders; 
Whereas it is necessary to address suicide 
in a holistic manner and recognize and ad-
dress suicidal ideation and not just the act of 
suicide in isolation; 
Whereas there is a need to address social 
determinants of health, which are conditions 
that directly and indirectly affect the 
health, health care, and wellness of individ-
uals and communities, in order to effectively 
provide care for all individuals living with 
mental illness and substance use disorders; 
Whereas mental health impacts physical 
health, and physical health impacts mental 
health; 
Whereas the current health care system in 
the United States does not adequately incor-
porate mental health and substance use dis-
orders into the assessment or delivery of 
care, as evidenced by the fact that all ‘‘vital 
signs’’ are currently for physical health 
alone and do not touch on mental health or 
substance use disorders; 
Whereas the lack of a united approach 
across the Federal Government to improve 
the care and related services for mental 
health and substance use disorders has left 
States and localities— 
(1) without adequate guidance or resources; 
(2) unable to provide the mental health and 
substance use disorder services needed to 
adequately meet the needs of their popu-
lations; and 
(3) unable to effectively distribute services 
to adequately meet the needs of their popu-
lations; 
Whereas there is a need for greater collabo-
ration across all Federal agencies that touch 
various aspects of the health care system in 
order to fully incorporate the needs and con-
cerns of everyone involved in the treatment 
and prevention of mental health and sub-
stance use disorders; 
Whereas there is a need for greater collabo-
ration between Federal, State, and local 
agencies that touch on various aspects of the 
health care system; 
Whereas there is a need for a centralized 
location within the Federal Government for 
good, reliable information on mental health 
and substance use disorders for providers, pa-
tients, and caregivers; 
Whereas there is a need for standardized 
definitions, standards of care, and metrics 
for mental health and substance use dis-
orders across disciplines; 
Whereas there is a need to change incen-
tives for providers to better ensure everyone 
with mental health and substance use dis-
orders gets access to the necessary care and 
treatment; 
Whereas 13 years after the date of enact-
ment of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domen-
ici Mental Health Parity and Addiction 
Equality Act of 2008 (subtitle B of title V of 
division C of Public Law 110–343), there is 
still a lack of compliance among insurers 
and failure to adequately cover mental 
health and substance use disorder services; 
Whereas Medicaid is the single largest 
payer of mental health and substance use 
disorder services, and reimbursement is far 
from adequate; 
Whereas there is a need to incentivize pay-
ers to adequately cover mental health and 
substance use disorder services in the same 
manner in which all specialty services are 
covered; 
Whereas there is a need to increase the 
number of mental health and substance use 
disorder providers; 
Whereas 55 percent of counties in the 
United States do not have a single psychia-
trist, psychologist, or social worker; 
Whereas only 10 percent of individuals in 
the United States suffering from a substance 
use disorder receive specialty treatment; 
Whereas there is a need to increase access 
to and utilization of telemedicine for mental 
health and substance use disorder services, 
both within States and across State lines; 
Whereas there is a need for a better way to 
share information among providers to better 
serve patient needs while still protecting pa-
tient privacy; 
Whereas there is a need for consistent care 
coordination and more effective transition 
services for patients moving between hos-
pitals and the community; 
Whereas safe housing needs to be recog-
nized as a basic requirement for successful 
treatment and needs to be better addressed 
in the transition of care; 
Whereas there is a need to improve social 
determinants of health, such as increased ac-
cess to stable housing and jobs, for individ-
uals suffering from mental illness and sub-
stance use disorders to have a sustained re-
covery; 
Whereas there is a need to provide care in 
more appropriate and integrated settings for 
all patients, such as treating geriatric pa-
tients in their homes as opposed to nursing 
homes, when appropriate, and in compliance 
with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and the decision 
of the Supreme Court of the United States in 
Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999); 
Whereas there is a need for greater focus 
on intensive outpatient, partial hospitaliza-
tions, residential programs, day programs, 
supported 
housing, 
assertive 
community 
treatment, mobile crisis services, peer sup-
port services, supported employment, and 
community-based services for adults with 
mental illness and substance use disorders; 
Whereas there is a need to ensure that 
services support individuals with mental 
health conditions and substance use dis-
orders to participate fully in their commu-
nities and live and thrive independently; 
Whereas there is a need to address isola-
tion issues geriatric patients face, which can 
negatively impact their mental health; 
Whereas 30 percent of first responders ex-
perience mental health conditions, such as 
depression and post-traumatic stress, and 
have higher rates of suicidal ideation and 
suicide attempt than the rest of the popu-
lation; 
Whereas depression, anxiety, post-trau-
matic stress, and psychosis are some of the 
most common conditions women experience 
pre- and postpartum; 
Whereas unmet parental mental health and 
substance use disorder treatment and service 
needs contribute to increased involvement 
with the child welfare system, which leads to 
preventable foster care placements, given 
that— 
(1) in 2018, 262,956 children entered foster 
care, with the leading reasons related to 
mental health and substance use disorder 
needs of the parents, with— 
(A) 36 percent of children entering care 
as a result of parental drug abuse; 
(B) 14 percent of children entering care 
as a result of the inability to cope of the 
caretaker; and 
(C) 5 percent of children entering care as 
a result of parental alcohol abuse; 
(2) even when necessary to ensure the safe-
ty of a child, foster care itself creates addi-
tional trauma for both the child and family; 
and 
(3) longstanding racial inequities in child 
welfare 
services 
create 
disproportionate 
child welfare involvement for Black, Native, 
and Latinx children and families, which ex-
acerbates the experiences of trauma for 
those families and contributes to health dis-
parities while not resulting in needed access 
to quality mental health and substance use 
disorder services; 
Whereas children and adolescents have 
unique needs when it comes to mental health

and substance use disorders and the services 
provided, given that— 
(1) 45 percent of children have experienced 
adverse childhood experiences that have the 
potential to significantly impact the mental 
health of the children; 
(2) in the last 5 years, 49.4 percent of chil-
dren who needed mental health services did 
not receive the necessary services, and there 
is a need for improved access to appropriate 
treatment services, which must focus on 
community-based 
supports 
and 
services 
available near their home, in order to effec-
tively prevent children from experiencing a 
mental health crisis; 
(3) many children suffering and struggling 
go undiagnosed and are not adequately sup-
ported, and there is a need to improve train-
ing and understanding of mental health and 
substance use disorders for educators since 
often there are barriers to mental health and 
substance use disorder treatment in a school 
setting; 
(4) 42 percent of school districts have re-
ported using threat assessment and risk as-
sessment teams, an approach created by the 
United States Secret Service that involves 
identifying, evaluating, and taking action on 
assumed 
current 
or 
potential 
threats, 
which— 
(A) can cause significant harm to the 
mental health and emotional well-being of 
children; 
(B) has compounded existent stigma for 
groups of students; 
(C) has had a disproportionate impact on 
students of color by initiating criminal 
justice involvement in lieu of more appro-
priate services; and 
(D) has had a disproportionate impact on 
students with disabilities; 
(5) families and caregivers need to be in-
cluded when treating children suffering from 
mental illness and substance use disorders; 
and 
(6) when children turn 18 years old they are 
cut off from mental health and substance use 
disorder services, which impacts continuity 
of care; 
Whereas there is a growing need for mental 
health and substance use disorder services 
among young adults and college-aged adults, 
and between 2007 and 2017, for individuals 
aged 18 to 34, there was a— 
(1) 108 percent increase in drug-related 
deaths; 
(2) 69 percent increase in alcohol-induced 
deaths; and 
(3) 35 percent increase in suicide deaths; 
Whereas, despite the rising need for mental 
health and substance use disorder treatment 
by young adults, there continues to be dis-
parities in accessing care experienced by 
young adults of color; 
Whereas 
5,500,000 
veterans 
and 
servicemembers rely on the Department of 
Veterans Affairs for health services, and 
1,500,000 veterans have received a mental 
health diagnosis, and— 
(1) 1 in 4 active duty members shows signs 
of a mental health condition; 
(2) the rate of post-traumatic stress dis-
order (referred to in this preamble as PTSD) 
is 15 times higher in servicemembers than 
compared to civilians due to military com-
bat and military sexual assault and trauma; 
(3) the rate of depression is 5 times higher 
in servicemembers as compared to civilians; 
(4) every day, 17 veterans die by suicide; 
(5) there is a fear of disclosing mental 
health conditions and substance use dis-
orders and seeking treatment due to nega-
tive career implications; and 
(6) less than 50 percent of veterans receive 
the mental health treatment and services 
they need; 
Whereas 11 percent of individuals entering 
the Department of Veterans Affairs health 
system meet the criteria for a substance use 
disorder; 
Whereas veterans are more likely to have 
an alcohol use disorder than civilians; 
Whereas 2 in 10 veterans with PTSD have a 
comorbid substance use disorder, and 1 in 3 
veterans seeking services for a substance use 
disorder also has PTSD, showing the inter-
connectedness between these conditions; 
Whereas there is a need to better educate 
all individuals in the criminal justice system 
on the impact and needs of individuals with 
mental health conditions and substance use 
disorders; 
Whereas the United States criminal justice 
system is the largest provider of mental 
health services, and it was not built, nor in-
tended to be used, for that purpose, and— 
(1) there are around 550,000 individuals in-
carcerated in the United States with serious 
mental illness; 
(2) 1 in 5 individuals incarcerated in the 
United States has a serious mental illness; 
and 
(3) of those incarcerated, 75 percent with a 
serious mental illness suffer from a co-occur-
ring substance use disorder; 
Whereas there is a need for incentives to 
reduce inappropriate incarceration and de-
tention for individuals with mental health 
and substance use disorder needs; 
Whereas one-third of individuals incarcer-
ated in the United States receive treatment 
for mental illness, and many times treat-
ment is inconsistent and inadequate, and 
there is a need for improved access to serv-
ices and treatments that are also trauma-in-
formed; 
Whereas there is a need to have mental 
health, substance use disorder, and diversion 
services available at all intercepts of the Se-
quential Intercept Model, a model developed 
to inform more appropriate community- 
based responses and divert individuals with 
mental illness and substance use disorders; 
Whereas there is a need to improve levels 
of coordination, care management, and in-
surance coverage before, during, and after in-
carceration; 
Whereas post-release navigation is key to 
keeping individuals from reentering the 
criminal justice system; 
Whereas 
there 
is 
insufficient 
under-
standing of the mental health effects of in-
carceration; 
Whereas there is a need to redefine the ju-
venile justice system to account for age and 
development reflecting the most up-to-date 
scientific consensus on brain development 
and behavior and ensuring that there are de-
velopmental and age appropriate services; 
Whereas the juvenile justice system must 
fulfill its purpose of supporting, rehabili-
tating, and treating children in need rather 
than punishing them, given that— 
(1) studies have shown that 70 percent of 
youth in detention have a diagnosed mental 
illness, and 60 percent of those youths may 
also meet the criteria for a substance use 
disorder; 
(2) 90 percent of individuals in the juvenile 
justice system have been exposed to trauma 
or violence, which may increase the likeli-
hood of juvenile justice involvement; 
(3) entry into the juvenile justice system 
may exacerbate the existing mental health 
and substance use disorder concerns of 
youths, particularly in the absence of con-
sistent screening and treatment for these 
conditions; and 
(4) an estimated 33 percent of children in 
long-term juvenile justice facilities have in-
tellectual, developmental, and other disabil-
ities and were receiving special education 
services, and therefore there is a need to 
have specific services and programs within 
the juvenile justice system with a focus on 
their needs; 
Whereas there is a need for services in the 
juvenile justice system to be trauma-in-
formed and developed for high-need individ-
uals; 
Whereas studies show that 41.2 percent of 
individuals who are diagnosed with a sub-
stance use disorder are also diagnosed with a 
mental illness, which is likely an underesti-
mate in light of the current barriers to iden-
tifying and reporting mental health con-
cerns; 
Whereas, given the high co-occurrence 
with mental illness, comprehensive care for 
substance use disorders should include access 
to psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, con-
tingency management, recovery support, all 
evidence-based 
medication-assisted 
treat-
ment, a multidisciplinary staff, and group 
therapy for adults, and— 
(1) addiction treatment centers should ei-
ther offer or have available comprehensive 
care and support and have the ability to 
treat mental illness as well as substance use 
disorders; and 
(2) to allow for treatment flexibility to fit 
the needs of the patient, there is a need to 
increase access to all evidence-based medica-
tion-assisted treatment in prisons, jails, and 
all addiction treatment centers; 
Whereas there are inequities in access, 
availability, and quality for mental health 
and substance use disorder services for mi-
nority communities, and— 
(1) there is greater stigma among racial 
and ethnic minority populations; 
(2) racial and ethnic minorities are dis-
proportionately affected by disabilities that 
result from mental health conditions; and 
(3) only 31 percent of African Americans 
and Hispanics and 22 percent of Asians re-
ceive mental health care compared to 48 per-
cent of Caucasians; 
Whereas 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (referred to in this 
preamble as LGBTQ) individuals are more 
than twice as likely to suffer from mental 
health conditions and substance use dis-
orders than heterosexual individuals, and— 
(1) 29 percent of LGBTQ youths attempt 
suicide, which is almost 5 times more than 
heterosexual youths; 
(2) approximately 31 percent of LGBTQ 
older adults report symptoms of depression, 
and 39 percent report seriously thinking 
about suicide; 
(3) 30.8 percent of transgender individuals 
report considering suicide compared to 2.3 
percent of heterosexual individuals; and 
(4) of the 4,890 transgender individuals in-
carcerated in State prisons, only 15 were 
confirmed as being housed according to their 
lived gender, while not being housed accord-
ing to lived gender poses a significant threat 
to mental health; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has high-
lighted the gaps in our health system when 
it comes to mental health and substance use 
disorder services and shown how sheltering 
in place and isolating can impact mental 
health and substance use, specifically show-
ing— 
(1) that 47 percent of individuals in the 
United States report that the pandemic has 
negatively impacted their mental health, 
with 21 percent saying that it has had a 
major negative impact; 
(2) a significant increase in the number of 
calls to suicide prevention hotlines; 
(3) a 1,000 percent increase in texts to the 
mental health hotline of the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration to about 20,000 texts in April 2020; 
(4) a 55 percent increase in alcohol sales; 
and 
(5) a record high of more than 100,000 over-
dose fatalities between May 2020 and April 
2021, driven by increased feelings of anxiety, 
depression, and use of substances; and

(6) an increase in burnout and mental 
health conditions among healthcare pro-
viders, with 49 percent experiencing burnout 
and 38 percent experiencing anxiety or de-
pression; and 
Whereas there is a need for a population 
health approach that examines the distribu-
tion of health across populations and focuses 
attention on the need to provide access to 
the best evidence-based treatment for indi-
viduals with mental health conditions and 
substance use disorders who need clinical 
intervention in order to effectively reduce or 
mitigate the impact of risk factors that lead 
to psychological distress among individuals 
in high-risk populations: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that in order to effectively address the high 
prevalence of individuals suffering from 
mental health conditions and substance use 
disorders, the United States needs to make 
historic financial investments into mental 
health and substance use disorder care and 
finally acknowledge such care as a priority 
in health care, equal to physical health, and 
recognize that— 
(1) mental health and physical health need 
to be treated together to treat the whole pa-
tient; 
(2) patient care needs to be patient-fo-
cused; 
(3) mental health and substance use dis-
order care needs to be proactive and treat in-
dividuals before they are in crisis; 
(4) any stigma associated with mental 
health and substance use disorders is com-
pletely unwarranted and serves as a barrier 
to care; 
(5) the Federal Government needs to create 
a comprehensive approach to improving the 
health care system that incorporates mental 
health and substance use disorders and in-
cludes system reform that— 
(A) aims to break down silos across the 
Federal, State, local, and Tribal levels for 
improved communication and care coordina-
tion; 
(B) provides a Federal framework to 
States, localities, and Indian Tribes that 
connects agencies and services so they can 
have guidance when working to address the 
mental health and substance use disorder 
needs of their communities; 
(C) incentivizes providers to see both more 
complex and less complex patients and to see 
patients in rural and underserved areas; 
(D) expects insurers to comply with parity 
laws and holds them accountable for not pro-
viding parity of mental health and substance 
use disorder services and treatments; and 
(E) requires both public and private payers 
to have higher reimbursement rates for men-
tal health and substance use disorder serv-
ices that are on par with medical and sur-
gical services; 
(6) the Federal Government needs to create 
a comprehensive approach to improving the 
health care system that incorporates mental 
health and substance use disorders and that 
includes system improvements that— 
(A) focus on early screening, diagnosis, and 
intervention across the care continuum to 
prevent mental health crises; 
(B) improve the ability of families to ac-
cess timely, affordable, and high-quality 
treatment and services; 
(C) strengthen mental health and sub-
stance use disorder services in schools and 
ensure there is engagement from all stake-
holders; 
(D) improve and expand community-based 
services so individuals have access to serv-
ices locally; 
(E) improve care coordination across treat-
ment settings so patients have services when 
needed and do not have to navigate the sys-
tem themselves; 
(F) promote a sustained recovery that in-
cludes social determinants of health, such as 
housing, jobs, and childcare; 
(G) can adjust to meet the needs of each in-
dividual to provide the best care for each in-
dividual; 
(H) ensure seamless transitions in care 
when moving through steps or processes; 
(I) end the criminalization of mental ill-
ness and substance use disorders and in-
crease programs for diversion that connect 
individuals to treatment, social supports, 
and social services; 
(J) provide access to high-quality and evi-
dence-based mental health and substance use 
disorder care for individuals who are incar-
cerated; 
(K) create young adult services and pro-
grams within the criminal justice system for 
individuals who are aged 18 to 25 to success-
fully reduce recidivism and that are in-
formed by neuropsychological brain science; 
(L) incorporate apprenticeship or job train-
ing programs into the criminal justice sys-
tem, particularly for youth, to empower 
them and reduce recidivism; 
(M) ensure cultural congruence so every-
one in need of mental health and substance 
use disorder care has services that meet 
their needs; 
(N) adopt a population health approach as 
a tool to help address ongoing disparities in 
access to mental health and substance use 
disorder care by youth and adults of color; 
(O) ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and queer individuals, commu-
nities of color, and immigrants have access 
to mental health and substance use disorder 
services that are culturally appropriate, are 
in the necessary language, and address any 
unique stigma from their communities; 
(P) enable veterans to access timely men-
tal health and substance use disorder care 
that ensures continuity and is free of any ad-
ministrative burdens; 
(Q) include training for educators, first re-
sponders, and clinicians to identify indica-
tors of mental health conditions and sub-
stance use disorders and to reduce stigma 
and bias related to these conditions so they 
can respond in a more productive way and 
connect individuals with more appropriate 
services; 
(R) support health care providers by ad-
dressing their mental health and substance 
use disorder needs to reduce burnout; 
(S) provide a process by which States can 
work with other States to reconcile licen-
sure and certification for and reimbursement 
to mental health and substance use disorder 
providers across State lines for the purpose 
of telemedicine; 
(T) leverage the current mental health and 
substance use disorder workforce by reduc-
ing administrative burdens to allow mental 
health and substance use disorder providers 
to perform to their highest level of licensure 
and certification; and 
(U) expand training opportunities and grow 
the workforce by partnering with schools 
and programs to provide free education to in-
dividuals who work in rural or underserved 
areas; 
(7) expanded access to mental health and 
substance use disorder care is essential to 
improving health and well-being; 
(8) all individuals in the United States de-
serve access to mental health and substance 
use disorder care without any barriers, such 
as cost or location of services; and 
(9) the United States needs to comprehen-
sively break down all barriers to receiving 
access to mental health and substance use 
disorder care, including financial burdens 
and location hurdles.

mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 519 
Whereas, on January 21, 1990, more than 
300,000 Ukrainians called for unity and inde-
pendence from the Soviet Union by forming 
a human chain between the cities of Kyiv 
and Ivano-Frankivsk; 
Whereas, on August 24, 1991, the elected 
Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine declared the 
independence of Ukraine from the Soviet 
Union with an overwhelming majority vote; 
Whereas, on December 1, 1991, more than 90 
percent of Ukrainian citizens voted in a na-
tional referendum in support of independ-
ence, with majorities in every region; 
Whereas, on February 8, 1994, Ukraine was 
the first member state of the Commonwealth 
of Independent States to join the Partner-
ship for Peace program of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) and has since 
deepened its relationship with the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization, recognized as an 
Enhanced Opportunities Partner; 
Whereas, on December 5, 1994, in an effort 
to solidify security commitments to Ukraine 
in return for its nuclear disarmament, the 
United States, the Russian Federation, and 
the United Kingdom signed the Budapest 
Memorandum 
on 
Security 
Assurances, 
whereby each country pledged to respect the 
independence and sovereignty of Ukraine’s 
borders while refraining from the threat or 
use of force against Ukraine; 
Whereas, on November 22, 2004, Ukrainians 
peacefully took to the streets in protest of a 
fraudulent presidential election, beginning 
the Orange Revolution and resulting in new 
elections under free and fair conditions; 
Whereas, 
on 
November 
21, 
2013, 
the 
Euromaidan protests began in favor of sign-
ing the European Union-Ukraine Association 
Agreement, resulting in the Revolution of 
Dignity and the removal of President Viktor 
Yanukovych by the Verkhovna Rada; 
Whereas, on February 20, 2014, the Russian 
Federation invaded the independent state of 
Ukraine, which continues to confront malign 
Russian activity, including the ongoing at-
tempted annexation of Crimea, conflict in 
the Donbas region, and threats to freedom of 
navigation in the Black Sea and the Sea of

Whereas, in March and November 2021, the 
Russian Federation deployed a massive troop

‘‘Our aim is . . .to convey a clear message to

Ukraine it will have severe consequences. 
NATO allies are ready to impose heavy eco-
nomic sanctions—political, financial sanc-
tions.’’; 
Whereas, on February 12, 2022, President 
Joseph R. Biden warned Russian President 
Vladimir Putin that the West ‘‘will respond 
decisively and impose swift and severe costs’’ 
if Russia further invades Ukraine; and

ing in Liverpool, delegates of the Group of 
Seven (G7) released a joint statement saying, 
‘‘Russia should be in no doubt that further 
military aggression against Ukraine would 
have massive consequences and severe cost 
in response. . .We reaffirm our unwavering 
commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, as well as the right of 
any sovereign state to determine its own fu-
ture.’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, 
SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE. 
The Senate— 
(1) commends the courage, resolve, and re-
straint shown by the Ukrainian people in 
their pursuit of sovereignty and democracy, 
and pays tribute to the many men and 
women who gave their lives in pursuit of a 
free and democratic Ukraine; 
(2) reaffirms unwavering United States 
support for a secure, democratic, and inde-
pendent Ukraine, free to choose its own lead-
ers and future; 
(3) condemns the illegal military invasion 
of Ukraine, the attempted annexation of Cri-
mea by the Russian Federation in 2014, and 
the violence fomented by Russian proxies in 
eastern Ukraine, an active conflict that con-
tinues in 2022; 
(4) reaffirms unwavering United States 
commitment to support the continuing ef-
forts of the Government of Ukraine to re-
store its territorial integrity by providing 
political, diplomatic, and military support, 
including additional lethal and non-lethal 
security assistance to strengthen the defense 
capabilities of Ukraine; 
(5) denounces the Russian military buildup 
of over 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s border, in-
cluding in Belarus, threatening the security 
of bordering NATO allies as provocative and 
reckless, 
contrary 
to 
established 
inter-
national norms; 
(6) condemns the Russian Federation’s con-
tinued disregard of international maritime 
law by partially blocking parts of the Black 
Sea and the Sea of Azov, which hamper free-
dom of navigation exercises and signifi-
cantly impact Ukraine’s economy; 
(7) encourages the President that, should 
any further invasion or other malign activ-
ity to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine 
occur by Russia, the United States Govern-
ment should use the tools at its disposal to 
impose significant costs on the Russian Fed-
eration to restore peace in Europe; and 
(8) encourages unity among NATO allies 
and the broader transatlantic community to 
convey solidarity in response to Russia’s 
unprovoked 
military 
aggression 
against 
Ukraine. 
SEC. 2. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
Nothing in this resolution may be con-
strued as— 
(1) a declaration of war or an authorization 
for the use of military force against the Rus-
sian Federation; or 
(2) authorization for the introduction of 
the

which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 520 
Whereas public education is a significant

viduals of the United States to contribute to 
the society, economy, and citizenry of the

age, and lead school districts and schools in 
partnership with educators, parents, and

(3) support services and programs that are

activities, and mental health support; 
Whereas public schools should foster inclu-
sive, safe, and high-quality environments in

Whereas public schools should provide en-
vironments in which all students have the 
opportunity to succeed beginning in their

State and local funds, supports the access of 
students to inviting classrooms, well-pre-
pared educators, and services to support 
healthy students, including nutrition and 
afterschool programs; 
Whereas teachers, paraprofessionals, and 
principals should provide students with a 
well-rounded education and strive to create

and parents make public schools vital com-
ponents of communities and are working

to: 
S. RES. 521 
Whereas, in 1776, people envisioned the 
United States as a new nation dedicated to

Independence that ‘‘all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their Cre-
ator with certain unalienable Rights, that

Whereas Africans were first brought invol-

of the basic and fundamental rights of citi-
zenship; 
Whereas, in 2022, the vestiges of those in-
justices and inequalities remain evident in 
the society of the United States; 
Whereas, in the face of injustices, people of

Ernest Finney, along with many others, 
worked against racism to achieve success

logical advancement of the United States; 
Whereas 
the 
contributions 
of 
African 
Americans from all walks of life throughout 
the history of the United States reflect the 
greatness of the United States; 
Whereas many African Americans lived, 
toiled, and died in obscurity, never achieving 
the recognition those individuals deserved, 
and yet paved the way for future generations 
to succeed; 
Whereas African Americans continue to 
serve the United States at the highest levels 
of business, government, and the military; 
Whereas the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln 
and Frederick Douglass inspired the creation 
of Negro History Week, the precursor to 
Black History Month; 
Whereas Negro History Week represented 
the culmination of the efforts of Dr. Carter 
G. Woodson, the ‘‘Father of Black History’’, 
to enhance knowledge of Black history 
through The Journal of Negro History, pub-
lished by the Association for the Study of 
African American Life and History, which 
was founded by Dr. Carter G. Woodson and 
Jesse E. Moorland; 
Whereas Black History Month, celebrated 
during the month of February, originated in 
1926 when Dr. Carter G. Woodson set aside a 
special period in February to recognize the 
heritage and achievements of Black people 
in the United States; 
Whereas Dr. Carter G. Woodson stated, 
‘‘We 
have 
a

history 
behind 
us. . . . If you are unable to demonstrate to 
the world that you have this record, the 
world will say to you, ‘You are not worthy to 
enjoy the blessings of democracy or anything 
else.’ ’’; 
Whereas, since its founding, the United 
States has imperfectly progressed toward 
noble goals; 
Whereas the history of the United States is 
the story of people regularly affirming high 
ideals, striving to reach those ideals but 
often failing, and then struggling to come to 
terms with the disappointment of that fail-
ure, before committing to try again; 
Whereas, on November 4, 2008, the people of 
the United States elected Barack Obama, an 
African-American man, as President of the 
United States; and 
Whereas, on February 22, 2012, people 
across the United States celebrated the 
groundbreaking of the National Museum of 
African 
American 
History 
and 
Culture, 
which opened to the public on September 24, 
2016, on the National Mall in Washington, 
District of Columbia: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) acknowledges that all people of the 
United States are the recipients of the 
wealth of history provided by Black culture; 
(2) recognizes the importance of Black His-
tory Month as an opportunity to reflect on 
the complex history of the United States, 
while remaining hopeful and confident about 
the path ahead; 
(3) acknowledges the significance of Black 
History Month as an important opportunity 
to commemorate the tremendous contribu-
tions of African Americans to the history of 
the United States; 
(4) encourages the celebration of Black 
History Month to provide a continuing op-
portunity for all people in the United States 
to learn from the past and understand the 
experiences that have shaped the United 
States; and 
(5) agrees that, while the United States 
began as a divided country, the United 
States must— 
(A) honor the contribution of all pioneers 
in the United States who have helped to en-
sure the legacy of the great United States; 
and 
(B) move forward with purpose, united tire-
lessly as a nation ‘‘indivisible, with liberty 
and justice for all.’’.

S. RES. 523 
Whereas a rare disease or disorder is a dis-
ease or disorder that affects a small number 
of patients; 
Whereas, in the United States, a rare dis-
ease or disorder affects fewer than 200,000 in-
dividuals; 
Whereas, as of the date of the adoption of 
this resolution, more than 7,000 rare diseases 
or disorders affect approximately 1 in 10 indi-
viduals in the United States; 
Whereas children with rare diseases or dis-
orders account for a significant portion of 
the population affected by rare diseases or 
disorders in the United States; 
Whereas many rare diseases and disorders 
are serious and life-threatening and lack ef-
fective treatments; 
Whereas, as a result of the enactment of 
the Orphan Drug Act (Public Law 97–414; 96 
Stat. 2049), important advances have been 
made in the research and treatment of rare 
diseases and disorders; 
Whereas the Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) has made strides in gathering pa-
tient perspectives to inform the drug review 
process as part of the Patient-Focused Drug 
Development program, an initiative that was 
reaffirmed under the FDA Reauthorization 
Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–52; 131 Stat. 1005); 
Whereas, although the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration has approved more than 1,000 
orphan indications for drugs and biological 
products for the treatment of rare diseases 
and disorders, 95 percent of rare diseases do 
not have an FDA-approved treatment for 
their condition; 
Whereas limited treatment options and dif-
ficulty obtaining reimbursement for life-al-
tering and lifesaving treatments can be chal-
lenging for individuals with rare diseases or 
disorders and their families; 
Whereas rare diseases and disorders in-
clude sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular at-
rophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, thyroid 
eye 
disease, 
myotonic 
dystrophy, 
t-cell 
prolymphocytic leukemia, microtia, meatal 
atresia, and conductive deafness; 
Whereas individuals with rare diseases or 
disorders can experience difficulty in obtain-
ing accurate diagnoses and finding physi-
cians or treatment centers with expertise in 
their rare disease or disorder; 
Whereas the 116th Congress passed a 4-year 
extension of the Rare Pediatric Disease Pri-
ority Review Voucher program under section 
529(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
metic Act (21 U.S.C. 360ff(b)) as part of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Pub-
lic Law 116–260; 134 Stat. 1182), providing an 
incentive for the development of therapies 
for children with rare diseases; 
Whereas the 116th Congress passed the Ad-
vancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act (Pub-
lic Law 116–16; 133 Stat. 852), improving ac-
cess to coordinated, patient-centered health 
care for children with complex and rare med-
ical conditions in Medicaid; 
Whereas the Food and Drug Administra-
tion and the National Institutes of Health 
support research on the treatment of rare 
diseases and disorders; 
Whereas 2022 marks the 39th anniversary of 
the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act (Pub-
lic Law 97–414; 96 Stat. 2049); 
Whereas Rare Disease Day is observed each 
year on the last day of February; 
Whereas Rare Disease Day is a global event 
that was first observed in the United States 
on February 28, 2009, and was observed in 
more than 100 countries in 2021; and 
Whereas Rare Disease Day is expected to 
be observed globally for years to come, pro-
viding hope and information for rare disease 
and disorder patients around the world: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates February 28, 2022, as ‘‘Rare 
Disease Day’’; and 
(2) recognizes the importance of, with re-
spect to rare diseases and disorders—

BRAUN, Mr. ROUNDS, Mr. MANCHIN, Mr. 
CRUZ, and Mr. HEINRICH) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 525 
Whereas Yellowstone National Park, the 
first national park in the world, was estab-
lished to share the wonders and preserve and 
protect the scenery, cultural heritage, wild-
life, and geologic and ecological systems and 
processes in their natural condition for the 
benefit and enjoyment of present and future 
generations; 
Whereas human history in the Yellowstone 
area dates back more than 11,000 years; 
Whereas the location of Greater Yellow-
stone at the convergence of the Great Plains, 
Great Basin, and Columbia Plateau Indian 
cultures means that many Native American 
Tribes have traditional connections to the 
land and its resources; 
Whereas, for thousands of years before the 
designation of the national park, the Greater 
Yellowstone area was a place where Native 
Americans hunted, fished, gathered plants, 
quarried obsidian, and used the thermal 
waters for religious and medicinal purposes; 
Whereas many Native American Tribes are 
associated with Yellowstone National Park, 
including—

resources and immense value of the region to 
Congress; 
Whereas painter Thomas Moran and pho-
tographer William Henry Jackson accom-
panied the first geographical survey of the 
Yellowstone area in 1871 and returned from

grandeur that earlier explorers could only 
describe with words; 
Whereas, on March 1, 1872, President Ulys-
ses S. Grant signed into law the Yellowstone

served and withdrawn from settlement, occu-
pancy, or sale under the laws of the United 
States, and dedicated and set apart as a pub-
lic park or pleasuring ground for the benefit 
and enjoyment of the people.’’; 
Whereas Yellowstone National Park is the 
first national park in the world, an idea that 
has spread throughout the world; 
Whereas Yellowstone National Park is the 
core of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, 
one of the last, largest, nearly intact natural 
ecosystems on the planet, where natural

ation; 
Whereas the Federal Government has made 
substantial efforts to maintain ecological

more than 500 active geysers, including the 
Old Faithful Geyser; 
Whereas Yellowstone National Park has 
the most active, diverse, and intact collec-
tions of combined geothermal, geologic, and 
hydrologic features and systems on Earth, 
including the Grand Prismatic Spring; 
Whereas Yellowstone National Park has 67 
species of mammals, 285 species of birds, 6 
species of reptiles, and 5 species of amphib-

the largest free-ranging bison herd in North 
America; 
Whereas Yellowstone National Park has 
over 1,000 native flowering species and 9 spe-
cies of conifers; 
Whereas Yellowstone National Park has 
more than 900 historic buildings and 25 sites, 
landmarks, and districts on the National 
Register of Historic Places; 
Whereas Yellowstone National Park has 
more than 720,000 museum items that docu-
ment the park and the western United States 
from pre-history through the present; 
Whereas the United States Army managed 
Yellowstone National Park between 1886 and 
1918; 
Whereas more than 1,850 archeological 
sites have been documented in Yellowstone 
National Park; 
Whereas Yellowstone National Park hosts 
over 4,000,000 visits annually, with people 
from across the world traveling to the park 
to enjoy the many recreational opportuni-
ties, including hiking, horseback riding, 
biking, camping, rafting, boating, swim-
ming, fishing, viewing wildlife and geo-
thermal features, photography, and explor-
ing, contributing hundreds of millions of dol-
lars into local and State economies in Wyo-
ming, Montana, and Idaho; 
Whereas, in 2020, visitors to Yellowstone 
National Park spent over $444,000,000 in gate-
way communities and supported 6,110 jobs in 
Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, with a cumu-
lative benefit to the local economy of 
$560,000,000; 
Whereas Yellowstone National Park part-
ners with concessioners that provide services 
for the general public, including lodging, 
dining, shopping, and medical services; and 
Whereas the National Park Service em-
ploys hundreds of permanent and seasonal 
staff dedicated to preserving the natural and 
cultural resources of Yellowstone National 
Park for the enjoyment, education, and in-
spiration of current and future generations: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates Yellowstone National 
Park on its sesquicentennial anniversary; 
(2) celebrates 150 years of the unique cul-
tural heritage and natural beauty of Yellow-
stone National Park; and

Mr.

lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 526 
Whereas on the afternoon of January 15, 
2022, 4 individuals at Congregation Beth 
Israel Synagogue in Colleyville, Texas were 
taken hostage and held at gunpoint by an 
armed antisemitic terrorist; 
Whereas during the hostage standoff, the 
terrorist echoed the demands of other mili-
tant Islamists, including the Islamic State 
(ISIS), Ayman al-Zawahri, lieutenant to 
Osama bin Laden and mastermind of many of 
deadliest al Qaeda terror attacks, and others 
within al Qaeda, that the United States re-
lease 
from 
Federal 
prison 
a 
certain 
radicalized terrorist known as the ‘‘Lady of 
al Qaeda’’; 
Whereas the ‘‘Lady of al Qaeda’’ was cap-
tured in Afghanistan with handwritten notes 
about perpetrating a ‘‘mass casualty attack’’ 
and a list of targets located in the United 
States that included the Empire State Build-
ing, the Statue of Liberty, and Wall Street, 
and was later convicted of the attempted 
murder and assault of United States nation-
als in 2010 and sentenced to 86 years in pris-
on; 
Whereas the hostages were able to run to 
safety and escape due to the quick thinking 
and bravery of one of the hostages, who 
threw a chair at the terrorist; 
Whereas the safe resolution to the January 
15th terrorist attack on Congregation Beth 
Israel demonstrated the critical importance 
of professional safety and security training, 
facility walk-throughs, and security assess-
ments for all Jewish community institu-
tions; 
Whereas since 2005, through the Nonprofit 
Security Grant Program, Congress has sup-
ported professional safety and security train-
ing for houses of worship, which was con-
ducted by Jewish community institutions, 
including Congregation Beth Israel Syna-
gogue, and by the Secure Community Net-
work under the auspices of the Conference of 
Presidents of Major American Jewish Orga-
nizations and the Jewish Federations of 
North America; 
Whereas the perpetrator targeted the peo-
ple worshiping at Congregation Beth Israel 
Synagogue because they were Jewish; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
are grateful for the swift action of local, 
State, and Federal law enforcement officials 
and emergency response teams who re-
sponded to this vile and antisemitic attack; 
Whereas Good Shepherd Catholic Commu-
nity Church provided support and housed 
family members of the worshipers held in-
side Congregation Beth Israel Synagogue 
during the 11-hour standoff; 
Whereas Pleasant Run Baptist Church of-
fered their thoughts and support during the 
standoff, and allowed for their parking lot to 
be used by the media; 
Whereas worshipers who were watching the 
service virtually contacted local law enforce-
ment officials once they realized there was 
an incident underway at Congregation Beth 
Israel Synagogue; 
Whereas antisemitism is a pernicious and 
offensive form of prejudice that runs con-
trary to the values of the United States; and 
Whereas in 2020 and 2021, there were 8,366 
incidents of extremism or antisemitism in 
the United States; 
Whereas while there can be no exhaustive 
definition of antisemitism in all its many 
forms, the International Holocaust Remem-
brance Alliance has developed the Working 
Definition of Antisemitism, with examples, 
that serves as an essential definitional tool 
used to determine contemporary manifesta-
tions of antisemitism; 
Whereas more than half of the religiously 
motivated hate crimes reported to the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation in 2020 were 
anti-Jewish hate crimes; 
Whereas Jewish Americans make up about 
2 percent of the population of the United 
States but crimes against them make up 55 
percent of the anti-religious hate crimes in 
the United States; 
Whereas the number of antisemitic inci-
dents, including assaults, vandalism, and 
harassment, in the United States have in-
creased over the past decade: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the antisemitic attack at 
Congregation 
Beth 
Israel 
Synagogue 
of 
Colleyville, Texas on January 15, 2022; 
(2) expresses gratitude that there was no 
loss of innocent life and that the hostages 
were able to escape unharmed and return 
safely to their loved ones;

Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. 
SCOTT
of South Carolina) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 527 
Whereas National Entrepreneurship Week 
is a congressionally chartered event taking 
place annually during the third week of Feb-
ruary for the purpose of democratizing and 
promoting 
entrepreneurship 
across 
the 
United States through education, connec-
tion, and collaboration; 
Whereas the United States is the most en-
trepreneurial country in the world and the 
entrepreneurial spirit woven into the na-
tional consciousness is central to the iden-
tity of the United States; 
Whereas that entrepreneurial spirit and 
the countless new businesses it has spawned 
have built the most innovative and produc-
tive economy in the history of the world; 
Whereas the United States is a nation of 
entrepreneurs, with new and small busi-
nesses comprising 99 percent of all businesses 
in the United States and employing nearly 
half of all workers in the United States; 
Whereas, given the importance of entrepre-
neurship to innovation, productivity gains, 
economic growth, job creation, and expand-
ing opportunity, a thriving entrepreneurial 
spirit is critical to post-COVID economic re-
covery in the United States; 
Whereas National Entrepreneurship Week 
celebrates the initiative, drive, creativity, 
and commitment embodied in the entrepre-
neurial spirit of the United States; 
Whereas National Entrepreneurship Week 
inspires students and the next generation of 
entrepreneurs by encouraging educators in 
grade schools, colleges, and universities 
across the United States to integrate entre-
preneurship education into the classroom; 
and 
Whereas research has demonstrated that 
students who participate in entrepreneurship 
education programs have better attendance 
records, perform better in core subjects, and 
have lower drop-out rates than students who 
do not participate in such programs: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of February 12 
through February 19, 2022, as ‘‘National En-
trepreneurship Week’’; 
(2) celebrates the importance of entre-
preneurs and startups to the United States 
economy; 
(3) recognizes the contributions entre-
preneurs make to expand opportunity, pro-
vide more inclusive prosperity, and increase 
the well-being of every community across 
the United States; 
(4) affirms the importance and urgency of 
enacting policies that promote, nurture, and 
support entrepreneurs and startups; and 
(5) encourages Federal, State, and local 
governments, schools, nonprofit organiza-
tions, and other civic organizations to ob-
serve National Entrepreneurship Week annu-
ally with special events and activities— 
(A) to recognize the contributions of entre-
preneurs in the United States; 
(B) to teach the importance of entrepre-
neurship to a strong and inclusive economy; 
and 
(C) to take steps to encourage, support,

BROWN, Ms. CANTWELL, Mr. CASEY, Ms. 
HASSAN, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. VAN HOL-
LEN, Ms. DUCKWORTH, and Mrs. MUR-
RAY) submitted the following concur-
rent resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions: 
S. CON. RES. 29 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution prevents Congress from making 
any law respecting an establishment of reli-
gion, prohibiting the free exercise of reli-
gion, or abridging the freedom of speech, the 
freedom of the press, the right to peaceably 
assemble, or to petition for a governmental 
redress of grievances, and was adopted on 
December 15, 1791, as 1 of the 10 amendments 
that constitute the Bill of Rights; 
Whereas the Bill of Rights, specifically the 
First Amendment to the Constitution, calls 
for the right of all persons to peaceably as-
semble, and to this end, all persons, regard-
less of their physical ability, shall be offered 
equal opportunity to access all federally 
funded, in whole or part, amenities; 
Whereas, in the 32 years since the signing 
of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) (in this preamble 
referred to as the ‘‘ADA’’), there have been 
unprecedented advances in all forms of tech-
nology; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention found that 1 in 4 
adults, or 61,000,000 people, have a disability; 
Whereas disability is a universal concern, 
as an aging population increases the inci-
dence of frailty and disability; 
Whereas, as significant advances in med-
ical treatment result in increased survival 
rates, the incidence of disability increases; 
Whereas, in 2020, the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics found that 4,700,000 veterans received 
service-related disability benefits; 
Whereas, in 2019, the percentage of work-
ing-age people in the United States who re-
ported having a work limitation due to a dis-
ability was 10.1 percent; 
Whereas the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to in-
sure that certain buildings financed with 
Federal funds are so designed and con-
structed as to be accessible to the physically 
handicapped’’, approved August 12, 1968 (42 
U.S.C. 4151 et seq.) (commonly known as the 
Architectural Barriers Act of 1968), was en-
acted to ensure that certain federally funded 
facilities are designed and constructed to be 
accessible to people with disabilities; 
Whereas the United States Access Board 
(in this preamble referred to as the ‘‘Board’’) 
is in the process of developing new guidelines 
for public rights-of-way that will address 
various issues, including access for blind pe-
destrians at street crossings, wheelchair ac-
cess to on-street parking, and various con-
straints posed by space limitations, roadway 
design practices, slope, and terrain; 
Whereas the Board’s new guidelines, when 
finalized, will cover pedestrian access to 
sidewalks and streets, including crosswalks, 
curb ramps, street furnishings, pedestrian 
signals, parking, and other components of 
public rights-of-way; 
Whereas the Board’s aim in developing 
these guidelines is to ensure that access for 
persons with disabilities is provided wher-
ever a pedestrian way is newly built or al-
tered, and that the same degree of conven-
ience, connection, and safety afforded the 
public generally is available to pedestrians 
with disabilities; 
Whereas once these guidelines are adopted 
by the Department of Justice, they will be-
come enforceable standards under title II of 
the ADA; and 
Whereas the United States was founded on 
principles of equality and freedom, and these 
principles require that all people, including 
people with disabilities, are able to engage 
as equal members of society: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) recognizes that people with disabilities 
in the United States experience barriers to 
access on a daily basis; 
(2) reaffirms its support of the Act entitled 
‘‘An Act to insure that certain buildings fi-
nanced with Federal funds are so designed 
and constructed as to be accessible to the 
physically handicapped’’, approved August 
12, 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq.) (commonly 
known as the Architectural Barriers Act of 
1968), and the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), and en-
courages full compliance with such Acts; and 
(3) pledges to make universal and inclusive 
design a guiding principle for all infrastruc-
ture bills and projects and will continue 
working to identify and remove the barriers 
that prevent all people of the United States 
from having equal access to the services pro-
vided by the Federal Government.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent the Senate con-
sider the following nomination: Cal-
endar No. 650, Martha Williams, of 
Montana, to be Director of the United 
States Fish and Wildlife Service; that 
the Senate vote on the nomination 
without intervening action or debate; 
that the motion to reconsider be con-

with no intervening action or debate; 
that any statements related to the 
nomination be printed in the RECORD; 
that the President be immediately no-
tified of the Senate’s action and the 
Senate resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the nomination of 
Martha Williams, of Montana, to be Di-
rector of the United States Fish and 
Wildlife Service? 
The nomination was confirmed. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate will now resume legislative session. 
SUPPORTING 
AN 
INDEPENDENT 
AND 
DEMOCRATIC 
UKRAINE 
AGAINST 
ANY 
FURTHER 
RUS-
SIAN MILITARY INVASION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of S. 
Res. 519, submitted earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 519) supporting an 
independent and democratic Ukraine against 
any further Russian military invasion, and 
for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today with Senator JEANNE SHA-
HEEN to request that the Ukraine reso-
lution introduced by us, along with 
Senators RISCH, MENENDEZ, CORNYN, 
and DURBIN be passed by unanimous 
consent. 
This is a dangerous time in the 
world, especially for our ally, Ukraine. 
There are over 150,000 Russian troops 
poised 
on 
their 
border, 
an 
over-
whelming force that could invade at a 
moment’s notice. 
This resolution is very simple and 
straightforward; it makes it clear that 
for 30 years Ukraine has been an inde-
pendent and sovereign country. It com-
mends the bravery of the Ukrainian 
people and their desire to integrate 
with the West, to align themselves 
with democratic values and freedom 
and continue to move away from the 
autocratic rule of Russia. 
It also acknowledges the over 14,000 
Ukrainians who have been killed since 
2014 in fighting against Russian backed 
separatists. 
It details the ongoing illegal Russian 
aggression against Ukraine. 
Most importantly, this resolution re-
affirms our unwavering support to 
Ukraine and the importance of our 
NATO alliance and our transatlantic 
partnerships. 
This is simply a strong, bipartisan 
show of support to our ally Ukraine as 
they face a threat and danger not of 
their making. 
I now yield the floor to my friend, 
Senator SHAHEEN from New Hampshire. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I know of no further 
debate on the resolution. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
Hearing no further debate, the ques-
tion is on agreeing to the resolution. 
The resolution (S. Res. 519) was 
agreed to.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Harriet Tub-

Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) 
Harriet 
Tubman 
was 
a 
formerly 
enslaved abolitionist who guided about 70 
people from slavery to freedom in 10 years. 
(2) Born in March 1822, Tubman was a nota-
ble abolitionist who not only freed herself, 
but also freed others from slavery. 
(3) Harriet Ross Tubman, born Araminta 
‘‘Minty’’ Ross, was born enslaved on the 
plantation of Anthony Thompson in Dor-
chester County, Maryland. 
(4) With the help of the Underground Rail-
road network, in the fall of 1849, Tubman es-
caped from Poplar Neck in Caroline County, 
Maryland, heading north to freedom in Penn-
sylvania. 
(5) With the passing of the Fugitive Slave 
Act as part of the Compromise of 1850, the 
operations to help enslaved persons escape 
became dangerous and she risked her life to 
rescue them from slavery. 
(6) Despite passage of the Compromise of 
1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act, Tubman

continued her work, escorting her refugees 
to Canada instead. 
(7) It was during the 1850s that Tubman 
made 13 trips back to Maryland, guiding ap-
proximately 70 enslaved persons to the 
North, including family members, and pro-
viding instruction to about 70 more who 
found their way to freedom on their own. 
(8) Regardless of the arduous process of 
helping fugitive enslaved persons escape 
through the Underground Railroad, not a 
single person was recaptured under Tub-
man’s supervision. 
(9) During 1859, Tubman aided abolitionist 
John Brown by recruiting supporters for his 
raid on Harper’s Ferry, a planned insurrec-
tion against slaveholders in Virginia and 
Maryland. 
(10) In the beginning of the Civil War, Tub-
man served as a spy, cook, and nurse in 
South Carolina and Florida. 
(11) Tubman also recruited newly freed Af-
rican-American men to join regiments of Af-
rican-American soldiers called United States 
Colored Troops. 
(12) In recognition of her abilities, Tubman 
served as an army scout and spy for Major 
General David Hunter and Colonel James 
Montgomery. Harriet Tubman was inducted 
into the Military Intelligence Corps Hall of 
Fame. 
(13) Tubman distinguished herself as the 
first woman to lead an armed expedition in 
the Civil War, the Combahee River Raid, re-
sulting in more than 700 enslaved persons in 
South Carolina being freed. 
(14) After the Civil War, Tubman fre-
quently 
sheltered 
and 
fed 
newly 
freed 
enslaved persons at her home on South 
Street in Auburn, New York, which she pur-
chased from Secretary of State William 
Henry Seward, even though she had little 
money herself. She found a means to an end 
by working as a domestic, selling produce 
from her garden, taking in donations of food, 
loans from friends, and raising pigs on her 
farm. 
(15) Tubman became active in the women’s 
movement as early as 1860. She attended 
meetings and gave speeches in her home 
State of New York, as well as in Boston and 
Washington, DC. 
(16) Tubman was an avid advocate for Afri-
can-American women and their civil rights. 
In 1896, she was invited as a speaker at the 
first meeting of the National Association of 
Colored Women in Washington, DC. 
(17) Although living in financial insecurity, 
Tubman transferred a 25-acre parcel of land 
to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion 
Church in 1903, which eventually became The 
Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged and Indi-
gent Negroes. At the time, few social serv-
ices existed for elderly and ill people of 
color. 
(18) Escaping slavery, risking everything 
to save her family and friends, aiding 
enslaved persons in escape from slavery, 
leading a military raid, championing the 
cause of women’s suffrage, advocating for 
civil rights and access to health care, Har-
riet Tubman is an individual that has per-
formed achievements that have had profound 
impacts on history and culture in the United 
States.
