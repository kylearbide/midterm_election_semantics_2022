CONGRATULATIONS TO ELLIOTT 
DUCHON ON HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to congratulate a constituent, who 
is a dear friend of mine, Elliott 
Duchon, on a well-earned retirement 
from the Jurupa Unified School Dis-
trict. 
Mr. Duchon has served as the super-
intendent of JUSD for 16 years and a 
public school teacher for 43 years. He 
has dedicated his career to ensuring 
that our students receive a well-round-
ed, quality education. 
During 
Mr. 
Duchon’s 
tenure, 
he 
oversaw the expansion of dual-immer-
sion programs to develop bilingualism 
and biliteracy in English and Spanish, 
the creation of makerspaces and inno-
vation centers to introduce students to 
career technical education and STEM 
education, and the growth of the 
Jurupa Adult School to open up learn-
ing opportunities to all. 
Mr. Duchon once said his greatest 
dream is for each and every student to 
have an equal opportunity to pursue 
higher education. It is safe to say that 
JUSD schools are better positioned to 
deliver on that dream because of the 
inspiring leadership of Mr. Duchon. 
He is also an active community mem-
ber and volunteer, and a dedicated hus-
band and father of three. 
I feel fortunate to have known him, 
and I am grateful for his commitment 
to our community. I am wishing him a 
very happy retirement. 
f 
IMPORTANCE OF 2020 CENSUS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge all 
American citizens to complete the 2020 
Census. The Census is an incredibly im-
portant tool that impacts our daily 
lives more than many people realize. 
Many important decisions impacting 
Federal 
support 
for 
education, 
healthcare, transportation and infra-
structure, and more will depend upon 
data the Census provides. The more 
people who participate, the more accu-
rate the Census will reflect the needs of 
our communities. 
Census takers have been working 
hard, going door-to-door to ensure ev-
eryone is counted. If you haven’t been 
visited by a Census taker, it is easy to 
complete 
online. 
Go 
to 
my2020census.gov to make sure you 
and your family are counted. Com-
pleting the Census is easy, quick, se-
cure, and very important. You can also 
respond by phone by calling 844–330– 
2020. 
The last day to complete the 2020 
Census is tomorrow, Wednesday, Sep-
tember 30. I can’t stress the impor-
tance of the Census enough, and I en-
courage every American household to 
ensure they are counted.

HONORING ZETA PHI BETA ON 100 
YEARS 
(Mr. CARSON of Indiana asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Zeta Phi Beta 
sorority on a century of nurturing 
leaders and improving communities. 
Founded 
on 
Howard 
University’s 
campus 100 years ago, Zeta has char-
tered hundreds of chapters worldwide 
and has a membership of 150,000. Its list 
of esteemed alumni is a who’s who of 
Black excellence, including trailblazers 
in business, law, advocacy, public serv-
ice, and more. 
I am incredibly proud that my grand-
mother, Julia Carson, is a part of this 
amazing legacy of women. 
As the sorority moves on to its next 
100 years, I have no doubt that it will 
maintain and strengthen its zeal for 
excellence. 
Once again, congratulations to Zeta 
Phi Beta on your first century of suc-
cess.

ENERGY EMERGENCY LEADERSHIP 
ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 362) to amend the Department of 
Energy Organization Act with respect 
to functions assigned to Assistant Sec-
retaries, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 362 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Energy 
Emergency Leadership Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FUNCTIONS ASSIGNED TO ASSISTANT 
SECRETARIES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Subsection (a) of section 
203 of the Department of Energy Organiza-
tion Act (42 U.S.C. 7133(a)) is amended by 
adding at the end the following new para-
graph: 
‘‘(12) Energy emergency and energy secu-
rity functions, including— 
‘‘(A) responsibilities with respect to infra-
structure, cybersecurity, emerging threats, 
supply, and emergency planning, coordina-
tion, response, and restoration; and 
‘‘(B) upon request of a State, local, or trib-
al government or energy sector entity, and 
in consultation with other Federal agencies 
as appropriate, provision of technical assist-
ance, support, and response capabilities with 
respect to energy security threats, risks, and 
incidents.’’. 
(b) COORDINATION.—The Secretary of En-
ergy shall ensure that the functions of the 
Secretary described in section 203(a)(12) of 
the Department of Energy Organization Act 
(as added by this Act) are performed in co-
ordination with relevant Federal agencies. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 362. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation and the 
two bills that will follow it are bipar-
tisan bills that will help protect our 
energy grid from cyberattacks. 
In hearings before our Energy Sub-
committee last year, we heard from the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-
sion, or FERC, from the members of 
FERC, that our energy grid is being at-
tacked each and every single day by 
state actors or their entities. 
Former 
Energy 
Secretary 
Perry 
started to address this important issue 
by creating the Office of Cybersecurity, 
Energy Security, and Emergency Re-
sponse, or CESER. He further enhanced 
its stature by making its leader an As-
sistant Secretary. 
We agree with those decisions, and 
this legislation would help elevate the 
importance of this issue while putting 
Congress’ bipartisan stamp of approval 
on these executive actions. 
H.R. 362 would simply amend section 
203(a) of the Department of Energy Or-
ganization Act by establishing a new 
assistant secretary position responsible 
for cybersecurity and emergency re-
sponse issues. 
The Department of Energy is the lead 
agency for ensuring the cybersecurity 
of the electric grid, and the newly cre-
ated assistant secretary would have ju-
risdiction over all energy emergency 
and security functions related to en-
ergy supply, infrastructure, and cyber-
security. 
This bill would also authorize the 
new assistant secretary to provide DOE 
technical assistance, as well as support 
and response capabilities with respect 
to energy security risks to State, local, 
or Tribal governments upon request. 
The bill would also require the assist-
ant secretary and the Department of 
Energy to coordinate with the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security and other 
relevant Federal agencies in carrying 
out the bill’s provisions. 
This bill would go a long way, in my 
opinion, in helping to protect the Na-
tion’s 
electric 
infrastructure 
from 
hackers who would attempt to disrupt 
our energy grid and cause untold harm 
to our economy, our daily lives, and 
our overall national security. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend 
Representatives WALBERG and Energy 
Subcommittee Ranking Member UPTON 
for their leadership and for working 
with Chairman RUSH and me on the En-
ergy Emergency Leadership Act. I also 
want to thank Ranking Member UPTON 
and full Committee Ranking Member 
WALDEN for their ongoing partnership 
with us over the years on cybersecurity 
matters. That partnership was essen-
tial in getting these three critical bills 
to the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of 
H.R. 362, Energy Emergency Leader-
ship Act. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation, spon-
sored by Representatives RUSH
and 
WALBERG, strengthens the Department 
of Energy’s important energy emer-
gency mission. It does so by requiring 
the well-established energy emergency 
and cybersecurity functions at DOE to 
be organized under the leadership of an 
assistant secretary confirmed by the 
United States Senate. 
Just over 21⁄2 years ago, then-Sec-
retary of the Department of Energy 
Rick Perry recognized the importance 
of elevating this mission within the 
Department, and he established an As-
sistant Secretary-led office, the Office 
of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and 
Emergency Response. This office has 
proven its worth in various situations 
over the past 2 years, Mr. Speaker, in-
cluding assistance relating to hurri-
canes and wildfires. 
This bill would amend the Depart-
ment of Energy Organization Act to es-
tablish in law and, therefore, maintain 
that a Senate-confirmed assistant sec-
retary would lead the Department of 
Energy’s emergency response and cy-
bersecurity functions. 
This legislation will ensure the De-
partment has the focused and account-
able leadership to more fully protect 
the public from fuel and electricity 
supply disruptions against all the haz-
ards, natural or man-made, including 
emerging threats from our foreign ad-
versaries to the Nation’s electric grid. 
The bill has been drafted to ensure 
the Department carries out its respon-
sibilities in coordination with other 
agencies by improving coordination 
across the Department, ensuring more 
effective interagency collaborations, 
and increasing accountability to the 
Congress. 
A vote for H.R. 362 is a vote for en-
suring high-level leadership over en-
ergy emergencies at the Department of 
Energy for the benefit of public safety 
and welfare, and for stronger cyberse-
curity protections in the electricity 
systems. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4967 
September 29, 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
THOMPSON), the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise for purposes of express-
ing my concerns with H.R. 362, H.R. 
360, and H.R. 359, in their current 
forms. 
Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that, 
without clarification, these bills risk 
significantly disrupting how the Fed-
eral Government has collaborated re-
garding cybersecurity for nearly two 
decades. 
Congress has repeatedly supported 
the framework that designates the De-
partment of Homeland Security as the 
lead for ensuring that Federal agencies 
work together and with the private 
sector to protect and secure critical in-
frastructure. 
This framework was developed in the 
wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to 
guard against repeating the mistakes 
of a disjointed, siloed approach to na-
tional security and is well-understood 
and has been well-litigated within this 
body. 
It has been reinforced repeatedly by 
numerous laws, Presidential policy di-
rectives, and executive orders that 
have the support of Democrats and Re-
publicans alike. 
b 1215 
The policy is clear: DHS serves as the 
lead agency responsible for coordi-
nating Federal efforts to protect crit-
ical infrastructure in the 16 diverse 
sectors. 
To carry out this mission, DHS, 
through the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency, or CISA, is 
tasked with coordinating with other 
sector-specific agencies. 
The Department of Energy is the sec-
tor-specific agency for the energy sec-
tor and is well-suited to do so. Its role 
as the facilitator of robust cybersecu-
rity within the energy sector is impor-
tant. 
However, the problem common to the 
three measures today is that, in their 
current forms, they risk siloing cyber-
security efforts when it comes to pro-
tecting the energy sector, as none of 
them acknowledges DHS as the coordi-
nating partner to DOE for cybersecu-
rity. 
As a reminder, this is the same infra-
structure that has been under sus-
tained, sophisticated attack from for-
eign adversaries, some of which have 
been successful. 
While cyberattacks against the en-
ergy sector have accelerated, the sec-
tor does not exist in a vacuum. Over 
the past few years, DHS and the FBI 
have been sounding the alarm about 
Russian-led attacks on energy infra-
structure that coincide with and often 
mirror attacks in other sectors. 
In a 2018 technical alert issued to all 
infrastructure sectors, DHS and the 
FBI described a multistage intrusion 
campaign by the Kremlin. The alert ex-
plained that Russia used a similar 
playbook to target U.S. entities as well 
as organizations in the energy, nuclear, 
commercial facility, water, aviation, 
and commercial manufacturing sec-
tors. 
In the face of these threats, the Cy-
bersecurity Solarium Commission and 
others have called for a redoubling of 
efforts to strengthen DHS’ role. 
I would like to enter into a colloquy 
with the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Chairman PALLONE, I remain con-
cerned that the cyber bill before us, as 
well as the other cybersecurity bills 
being considered today, do not provide 
sufficient direction to the Secretary of 
Energy to coordinate his Department’s 
cybersecurity activities with the De-
partment of Homeland Security. 
Is it your intent that the activities 
authorized by this legislation be car-
ried out in coordination with the 
Homeland Security Secretary and that 
Department? 
Mr. PALLONE. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I 
yield to the gentleman from New Jer-
sey. 
Mr. PALLONE. Yes, Mr. Speaker, it 
is absolutely my intent and the intent 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee that these bills be implemented 
in coordination with the Secretary and 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
In fact, the sole reason we are amend-
ing these bills is to make clear that the 
Department of Energy must implement 
these bills in coordination with other 
Federal agencies. 
I want to make clear that we intend, 
first and foremost, DOE to coordinate 
with the Department of Homeland Se-
curity. We have made that clear to 
DOE at the highest levels, and the De-
partment has acknowledged that it will 
coordinate with the Department of 
Homeland Security in implementing 
these bills. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to hear that, with-
out any equivocation, Mr. PALLONE 
fully expects DOE to coordinate with 
DHS, but that only addresses one of my 
concerns. 
My other concern is that these bills 
do not, in any way, shape, or form, de-
tract from or erode the existing au-
thorities of the Secretary and Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, including 
the authorities set forth in the Cyber-
security and Infrastructure Security 
Act of 2018. 
I understand that is your position 
that these bills do not in any way in-
fringe on DHS’ existing authorities or 
prerogatives. Is that correct? 
Mr. PALLONE. If the gentleman con-
tinues to yield, yes, Chairman THOMP-
SON, it is correct, and I thank my 
friend, the chairman of the Homeland 
Security Committee, for that question 
and the opportunity to further clarify 
what these bills do and do not do. 
These bills completely confine them-
selves to codifying or further speci-
fying authorities and obligations the 
Secretary of Energy already has as the 
sector-specific agency for electricity 
under the FAST Act, the Federal 
Power Act, and the Department of En-
ergy Organization Act. 
So let me make this clear: Nothing in 
these bills is intended to infringe, cur-
tail, or otherwise affect the authorities 
of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity as they exist at this moment. And 
I will go even further to say that noth-
ing in these bills actually affects, in 
any way, shape, or form, the existing 
authorities or prerogatives of the De-
partment of Homeland Security or its 
Secretary in any area. Any interpreta-
tion to the contrary is simply incor-
rect. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend from New 
Jersey for that information. 
To be clear, it is your intention that 
these measures do not affect DHS’ au-
thority under PPD–21, PPD–41, Execu-
tive Order 13691, and Executive Order 
13636? 
Mr. PALLONE. If the gentleman con-
tinues to yield, that is correct, Mr. 
Chairman. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Would you agree to work with me to 
communicate to the Senate and the ad-
ministration that the intention behind 
these measures is to have the Sec-
retary of Energy coordinate activities 
with DHS consistent with the existing 
cybersecurity framework? 
Mr. PALLONE. If the gentleman con-
tinues to yield, yes, and I would be 
pleased to do so. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. PALLONE for ad-
dressing my questions. 
While I still have concerns over these 
measures, I appreciate his willingness 
to put into the RECORD these state-
ments and look forward to working 
with him to clarify expectations going 
forward. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman and understand that he 
continues to have concerns, and I know 
I may not be able to address them all 
today, but I commit to working with 
my friend from Mississippi and my Re-
publican colleagues to try to further 
address these concerns going forward. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
New Jersey for his cooperation and 
clarifying these three pieces of legisla-
tion. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I hope 
my colleagues will join me and the 
chairman of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee in supporting passage of 
this legislation and our efforts to en-
sure that our electric grid and our 
power supply sources are safe and se-
cure. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
360, the Cyber Sense Act of 2020. 
Grid security is a national security 
issue and one that is clearly and prop-
erly delegated under law to the Sec-
retary of Energy to manage together 
with the industry. We must give the 
electric sector the tools and tech-
nologies necessary to protect our grid 
from malicious harm. 
Fortunately, there has not yet been a 
broad cyberattack that has taken down 
large parts of the grid in the United 
States, but we must not let our guard 
down. 
H.R. 360 gives the Department of En-
ergy important and new authorities to 
facilitate more secure technologies and 
equipment in our Nation’s grid. It also 
now requires the Secretary to coordi-
nate with the Department of Homeland 
Security and other relevant Federal 
agencies in order to ensure smooth and 
seamless implementation across the 
Federal Government. 
This bill requires the Department of 
Energy to set up a voluntary Cyber 
Sense program to identify cyber-secure 
products that could be used in the 
bulk-power system. 
This program would also provide 
technical assistance to electric utili-
ties and product manufacturers to as-
sist them in developing solutions to 
mitigate cyber vulnerabilities in the 
grid. 
I thank my colleagues, Representa-
tive MCNERNEY
and Representative 
LATTA, for their hard work on this crit-
ical issue. Their partnership and bipar-
tisan leadership on cybersecurity mat-
ters continues to benefit us all. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 360, the Cyber 
Sense Act, was authored and intro-
duced by my Energy and Commerce 
Committee colleagues, Mr. LATTA and 
Mr. MCNERNEY. 
The bill was reported unanimously 
from the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee to improve the cybersecurity of 
the supply chains for the components 
of our Nation’s electricity infrastruc-
ture. 
To ensure the security of our Na-
tion’s electricity grid means we must 
ensure bulk-power system components 
and technologies are not vulnerable to 
cyber threats and attacks. 
This is especially important, given 
the threats our nation-state adver-
saries pose to the bulk-power and elec-
tric systems, as indicated by the Presi-
dent’s May 1, 2020, executive order giv-
ing the Department of Energy author-
ity to take action to protect the bulk- 
power system. This bill would help that 
effort. 
H.R. 360 would establish a voluntary 
Department of Energy program that 
identifies and promotes cyber-secure 
products intended for use in the bulk- 
power system, including products re-
lated to industrial control systems. 
The bill would authorize the Depart-
ment of Energy to provide technical as-
sistance to electric utilities, product 
manufacturers, and other electricity 
sector stakeholders to help mitigate 
identified 
cybersecurity 
vulnerabili-
ties. 
The bill also was amended to make 
clear these efforts of the Department of 
Energy would include, as appropriate, 
other relevant Federal agencies like 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
Mr. Speaker, a vote for H.R. 360 is a 
vote for providing an important new 
tool to electric utility supply chains 
from cybersecurity threats. I urge sup-
port of the legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, for 
lawmakers to encourage and enable in-
novative advancements that can im-
prove the security and reliability of 
our Nation’s energy grid, we must work 
on a bipartisan basis, as the bills under 
consideration show. 
Fortunately, the modernization and 
innovation of our Nation’s energy in-
frastructure is already under way. 
What was once a one-way delivery sys-
tem has evolved into a dynamic net-
work where information and energy 
flow both ways. 
Technological advancements are also 
born from the need to secure the en-
ergy grid against potential physical 
and cyber threats. For example, the 
technology allowing for the rerouting 
of power and quick response in the 
event of attacks is being deployed 
across the grid. 
The 
cooperation 
among 
Federal, 
State, and local governments is essen-
tial to protecting Americans and our

Nation’s infrastructure. Given today’s 
cyber environment, it is more impor-
tant than ever that Congress pursue 
policies that continue to foster these 
exciting developments and support our 
grid infrastructure. 
This bill, the Cyber Sense Act of 2019, 
makes important headway in pro-
tecting our critical grid infrastructure. 
The Cyber Sense Act would create a 
voluntary program through the De-
partment of Energy to identify cyber- 
secure products intended for use in the 
bulk-power grid through a testing and 
verification program. 
The bill also establishes a testing 
process for products, along with a re-
porting process for cyber vulnerabili-
ties. It would require the Secretary of 
Energy to keep a related database on 
the products which will aid electric 
utilities that are evaluating products 
and their potential to cause harm to 
the electric grid. 
The 
bulk-power 
system 
supports 
American industry and provides all the 
benefits of reliable electric power to 
the American people. However, the in-
creasing frequency of cyberattacks on 
industrial control systems of critical 
infrastructure importance continues to 
be a concern to the electric power sec-
tor. 
As the grid is modernized and the 
digital advantages afforded by internet 
connectivity are adopted, it is essential 
that we ensure these systems are as se-
cure as possible. Any vulnerable com-
ponent in the grid is a threat to our se-
curity, and this bill will go a long way 
to strengthening our system. 
I thank my colleague, Mr. LATTA, for 
his partnership in our efforts as co- 
chairs of the Grid Innovation Caucus, 
and I look forward to continuing to 
work with him and others to ensure a 
more secure and resilient grid. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Mem-
bers to support this bill. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA), the 
coauthor of this bill. 
b 1230 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, my friend, the ranking 
Republican Member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, for yielding. 
I rise in support of my legislation, 
H.R. 360, the Cyber Sense Act. 
This legislation is one of two bipar-
tisan bills that my friend from Cali-
fornia, Congressman MCNERNEY, and I 
have worked on over the past two Con-
gresses to improve the resiliency of our 
Nation’s 
electric 
grid 
against 
cyberattacks. The second, H.R. 359, will 
be considered following this debate, 
and I urge my colleagues to also sup-
port it. 
Mr. Speaker, over the last quarter 
century, 
we 
have 
seen 
incredible 
changes in the way we communicate 
with the rest of the world and the way 
we engage in commerce. Along with 
these changes, we have also seen inno-
vations in technologies that power so-
ciety, resulting in a more efficient and 
streamlined electric grid. 
Our country’s grid has maintained a 
high level of reliability as our society 
has undertaken these changes, which is 
a fact that should not be taken for 
granted. 
Unfortunately, the promise of a more 
interconnected society also means we 
must also address the challenges and 
vulnerabilities 
that 
arise 
with 
it. 
Every day, malignant actors, ranging 
from individuals, hackers, and foreign 
states, are attempting to exploit vul-
nerabilities in our electric grid to 
cause chaos or for other nefarious pur-
poses. 
To improve and protect our Nation’s 
grid, I introduced the Cyber Sense Act, 
which would create a voluntary Cyber 
Sense 
program 
within 
the 
United 
States Department of Energy to iden-
tify and promote cyber-secure products 
for use in the bulk-power system. It 
would also establish a testing process 
for the products along with a reporting 
process of cybersecurity vulnerability. 
This legislation was unanimously re-
ported out of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee last year and is sup-
ported by the Department of Energy, 
and industry. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the full com-
mittee 
Chairman 
PALLONE, 
Sub-
committee Chairman RUSH; the full 
committee Republican Ranking Mem-
ber WALDEN, and also subcommittee 
Ranking Member UPTON; and both the 
majority and minority E&C staff for 
helping us get these bills where they 
are today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the Cyber Sense Act as well as 
H.R. 359. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
other speakers on this side. I would 
just encourage my colleagues to join 
me in supporting passage of H.R. 360. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional Members that wish to 
speak. 
Mr. Speaker, I enter into the RECORD 
a letter to the Speaker and the minor-
ity leader from the American Public 
Power Association, Edison Electric In-
stitute, and the National Rural Elec-
tric Cooperative Association in support 
of this legislation.

Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: We are writing in support of 
full House consideration of three electric 
grid security bills passed by the House En-
ergy and Commerce Committee: H.R. 359, the 
Enhancing Grid Security through Public-Pri-
vate Partnerships Act; H.R. 360, the Cyber 
Sense Act of 2020; and H.R. 362, the Energy 
Emergency Leadership Act. 
APPA is the national service organization 
for not-for-profit, community-owned utili-
ties that power 2,000 towns and cities nation-
wide. Public power utilities account for over 
15 percent of all electric sales to over 49 mil-
lion customers in every state but Hawaii. 
EEI is the association that represents all 
U.S. investor-owned electric companies. EEI 
members provide electricity for about 220 
million Americans, and operate in all 50 
states and the District of Columbia. NRECA 
is the national service organization rep-
resenting the interests of cooperative elec-
tric utilities and the consumers they serve. 
More than 900 not-for-profit rural electric 
utilities provide electricity to over 42 mil-
lion people in 48 states. 
Protecting and maintaining electric sector 
security and reliability is a top priority for 
our associations and our members. To keep 
up with evolving threats, the industry wel-
comes close coordination with government 
partners. The bills scheduled for consider-
ation by the House this week are aimed at 
strengthening our shared responsibility to 
protect the nation’s critical infrastructure. 
We are particularly supportive of H.R. 359 
and H.R. 362. H.R. 359 directs DOE to estab-
lish a program to facilitate and encourage 
public-private partnerships to promote and 
advance the physical and cybersecurity of 
the electric power sector. H.R. 362 would 
amend the DOE Organization Act to include 
energy 
emergency 
and 
energy 
security 
among the functions that the Secretary as-
signs to an Assistant Secretary, with the in-
tent to clarify and codify the functions of 
DOE’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Secu-
rity, and Emergency Response (CESER). 
Thank you for your consideration. We ap-
preciate your leadership and efforts to help 
improve the security of our nation’s electric 
grid. 
Sincerely, 
AMERICAN PUBLIC POWER 
ASSOCIATION. 
EDISON ELECTRIC 
INSTITUTE. 
NATIONAL RURAL ELECTRIC 
COOPERATIVE 
ASSOCIATION. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 359. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by ac-
knowledging the leadership of two of 
my Energy and Commerce Committee 
colleagues, Representative MCNERNEY 
of California and Representative LATTA 
of Ohio, for introducing H.R. 359, the 
Enhancing Grid Security Through Pub-
lic-Private Partnerships Act. 
This bill will go a long way in ad-
dressing both the physical and cyberse-
curity of the Nation’s utilities. 
H.R. 359 directs the Secretary of En-
ergy, in consultation with the Electric 
Reliability Organization, States, other 
Federal agencies, and industry stake-
holders, to create and implement a pro-
gram to enhance the physical and cy-
bersecurity of electric utilities. 
Now, some of the critical provisions 
within this bill include the voluntary 
implementation 
of 
self-assessments, 
maturity modeling, and auditing. 
This bill also includes cybersecurity 
training in order to help mitigate sup-
ply chain risk. 
Utilities would also be encouraged to 
share best practices and data collection 
within the electric sector, while also 
improving the cybersecurity of third- 
party utility vendors. 
H.R. 359 also directs the Secretary of 
Energy to deliver a report to Congress 
on general cybersecurity concerns and 
distribution systems. 
Any information that is provided to 
the Department of Energy under this 
program would be protected to ensure 
the confidentiality of this sensitive in-
formation. And like the other two cy-
bersecurity 
bills 
we 
already 
have 
passed today; this legislation requires 
the Secretary of Energy to coordinate 
with the Department of Homeland Se-
curity and other relevant Federal agen-
cies to ensure good communication and 
smooth implementation across the gov-
ernment. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, the bill in-
structs the Secretary of Energy to up-
date the Interruption Cost Estimate, or 
ICE, Calculator at least once every 2 
years. 
The ICE Calculator, which was devel-
oped through a partnership between 
the Department of Energy’s Lawrence 
Berkeley Lab and Nexant, Inc., is an 
electric reliability planning tool that 
can be used for estimating electricity 
interruption costs and the benefits as-
sociated 
with 
reliability 
improve-
ments. 
So, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 359 is an im-
portant piece of legislation that will 
help address the security of America’s 
electric utilities, and I urge all my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 359, the Enhancing 
Grid Security Through Public-Private 
Partnerships Act, was authored by my 
Energy and Commerce Committee col-
leagues Mr. MCNERNEY and Mr. LATTA. 
The bill was reported unanimously 
from the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee as an important measure for 
strengthening the cybersecurity and 
resilience in the energy systems used 
to deliver power to our homes and busi-
nesses. 
Mr. Speaker, protecting our Nation’s 
critical electric infrastructure is a 
shared responsibility. It requires ro-
bust partnerships between industry and 
the government to leverage strength 
and ensure the responsive and resilient 
system that the public needs and relies 
upon. 
H.R. 359 focuses on these very part-
nerships. The bill would establish a 
program to facilitate and encourage 
public-private partnerships to promote 
and enhance physical and cybersecu-
rity of electric utilities. 
The bill would require the Secretary 
of Energy to deploy the Department of

Energy’s world-class technical know- 
how to assist utilities with cybersecu-
rity practices and procedures, espe-
cially those utilities that have fewer 
resources due to their size or the re-
gion in which they are located. 
It would foster development of matu-
rity models, self-assessments, and au-
diting methods. 
It would provide training and tech-
nical assistance to electric utilities to 
address and mitigate cybersecurity 
supply chain management risks. 
And H.R. 359 would increase opportu-
nities for sharing best practices and 
data collection within the electric sec-
tor. 
The amended version of the bill also 
makes clear the Department of Energy 
will work as appropriate with other 
Federal agencies to safeguard the elec-
tric system. 
A vote for H.R. 359 is a vote for pro-
viding an important new tool to pro-
tect our Nation yet once again from 
these 
very 
serious 
cybersecurity 
threats. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
In today’s cyber environment, it is 
more important than ever that Con-
gress pursue policies that continue to 
support our grid infrastructure and se-
cure it against potential physical and 
cyber threats. 
This is an issue I feel very passionate 
about, as the grid is the backbone of 
our economy and touches every aspect 
of our lives. 
Any 
vulnerable 
component 
is 
a 
threat to our physical and national se-
curity, as well as our clean energy fu-
ture, making it imperative that we in-
vest in grid modernization and secu-
rity. 
That is why I am proud to co-chair 
the bipartisan Grid Innovation Caucus 
along with my good friend from across 
the aisle, Mr. LATTA from Ohio. 
Together, we are focused on pro-
viding a forum for discussing solutions 
to the many challenges facing the grid 
and to educate Members of Congress 
and staff about the importance of the 
electric grid with relation to the econ-
omy, energy security, and advanced 
technologies being utilized to enhance 
grid capabilities. 
Time is of the essence, as a recent re-
port from the Congressional Research 
Service found that our Nation’s bulk- 
power system faces new and evolving 
cybersecurity threats on a daily basis. 
These cyberattacks can take mul-
tiple forms, such as a direct attack 
aimed at the electric grid itself or an 
indirect attack aimed at other critical 
infrastructure, which in turn could im-
pact the operation of the security of 
the grid. 
Recent cyber threats to the electric 
grid, 
such 
as 
the 
Triton 
and 
BlackEnergy attacks, have come in the 
form of deposits of malware on grid in-
dustrial 
control 
system 
networks, 
which possess the capability to damage 
or take over certain aspects of system 
control or functionality. 
In addition to this, future cyber 
threats to the grid are expected to re-
sult from attacks directed via the 
Internet of Things devices connected to 
networks. As the CRS report noted, an 
example of such an IoT-based attack on 
residential or commercial thermostats 
could result in false power demand 
readings, causing a utility to ramp up 
power production unnecessarily. 
Without proactive management of 
cyber threats facing the grid, utilities 
across the Nation will continue to be 
highly vulnerable to potentially sig-
nificant attacks. 
My bill, which I introduced along 
with Mr. LATTA, assists us in this ef-
fort to bolster America’s electrical in-
frastructure by encouraging coordina-
tion between the Department of En-
ergy and electric utilities. 
It accomplishes this by creating a 
program to enhance the physical and 
cybersecurity 
of 
electric 
utilities 
through assessing security vulnerabili-
ties, increasing cybersecurity training, 
and data collection. 
My bill would also require the Inter-
ruption Cost Estimate Calculator— 
which is used to calculate the return 
on investment on utility investments— 
to be updated at least every 2 years to 
ensure accurate calculations. 
By encouraging partnerships among 
the DOE, State regulatory authorities, 
industry stakeholders, and other Fed-
eral agencies to promote and advance 
physical security and cybersecurity for 
electric utilities, we can best position 
ourselves to keep the Nation’s lights 
on and to insulate our economy against 
future cyber threats. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of 
the full committee, Mr. PALLONE, for 
moving this bill forward, and I thank 
the ranking member of the full com-
mittee for helping move this forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the prior speaker for his comments and 
great work on these pieces of legisla-
tion. 
Together, we are doing what we can 
to protect America’s energy sector 
from attack, and I thank Mr. MCNER-
NEY and others on the committee for 
their work. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
ask all Members to support this legis-
lation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 359, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from

tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on H.R. 
1289. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
b 1245 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in strong support of Represent-
ative THOMPSON’s legislation, H.R. 1289, 
the Preserving Home and Office Num-
bers in Emergencies Act of 2019, or the 
PHONE Act. 
Mr. Speaker, after the Atlas and 
Tubbs fires in October 2017 in northern 
California, Representative THOMPSON’s 
constituents returned to what was left 
of their homes. In the rebuilding proc-
ess, many of them were frustrated to 
learn that their phone numbers, which 
they had had for years, had been given 
away by the phone company. 
It was as if their phone number, of all 
things, went up in smoke with the rest 
of their lifelong possessions. This issue 
just continues to grow as natural disas-
ters like fires and hurricanes have be-
come all too common and more severe 
as a result of climate change. 
So, just this past weekend, hundreds 
of homes in Napa and Sonoma Counties 
had to be evacuated because of another 
fast-moving fire, and this bill aims to 
fix the problems that relate to phone 
numbers during these crises. 
First, if the President has issued a 
major disaster declaration, and a Gov-
ernor has designated an area to the 
Federal Communications Commission 
under the PHONE Act, the phone num-
bers in that designated area cannot be 
reassigned for 1 year. 
Second, if a consumer needs more 
time, this legislation allows them to 
get another yearlong extension. We 
know this is important because, in 
some disasters, like Superstorm Sandy 
in my district, for example, the home- 
rebuilding process took, in some cases, 
over 6 years. 
Third, the legislation would allow 
consumers whose homes are inacces-
sible or uninhabitable to cancel their 
service without a cancelation fee or re-
subscription fee when they get phone 
service somewhere else in the area dur-
ing that covered period. 
Now, I am glad we could reach an 
agreement with our Republican col-
leagues on this part of the bill to en-
sure this policy makes sense in prac-
tice. This was a compromise, and, 
therefore, I know there are some things 
that they would do differently. At the 
same time, there are a few things that 
we on this side of the aisle may have 
done differently. But with this com-
promise, this policy is simple yet, I be-
lieve, powerful. 
In the age of robocalls, dialing our 
friends and loved ones from phone 
numbers we have always had is how we 
get through. A lot of people simply will 
not pick up the phone if they don’t rec-
ognize the phone number, and that is 
why this legislation is so important. 
The legal effect and intent of this bill 
are designed purposely to be narrow, 
but it plugs a small gap in the law, 
which will mean the world to the con-
sumers who will have one less thing to 
worry about as they face rebuilding in 
the aftermath of a devastating natural 
disaster. 
Again, I want to thank Representa-
tives THOMPSON and ROONEY for their 
bipartisan leadership on this bill. The 
PHONE Act is a commonsense bill, and 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 1289, the 
PHONE Act. Now, this legislation will 
ensure that Americans who lose their 
homes during a wildfire or other nat-
ural disaster do not also have to worry 
about losing their home phone num-
bers. 
As we have seen recently from the 
tragic wildfires that have ravaged com-
munities in California and my home 
State of Oregon, these disasters can de-
stroy everything in their path, often 
with little notice. No matter how resil-
ient a home or communications tower 
might be, you cannot regulate your 
way out of a fire’s burning path. 
When a natural disaster occurs, the 
Federal Emergency Management Agen-
cy, FEMA, is activated to provide 
emergency 
housing 
assistance 
and 
other resources. If your house burns to 
the ground, the last thing you should 
have to worry about is whether or not 
your landline phone number will be 
available to you when you do return. 
Yet, that is what happens. 
Many people, especially seniors, rely 
on their landline to stay connected to 
their family, their doctor, or others. 
Thankfully, the Federal Communica-
tions Commission already has a process 
to prevent victims of natural disasters 
from losing their landline numbers. 
The FCC uses its authority, and did 
this as recently as last week for north-
ern California and Oregon, to waive 
rules and regulations that require 
landline phone numbers to return to 
the pool of available numbers when a 
home is completely destroyed by a nat-
ural disaster. So what this bill does is 
codify the process and seeks to make 
several improvements. 
During the committee process, Re-
publicans sought changes to this bill to 
ensure it does not upend the current 
procedure, so no consumers will be left 
in the lurch. 
This type of relief should only apply 
to areas where significant physical 
damage has occurred to render a home 
inhabitable, as is the objective of the 
bill. 
We worked for the inclusion of FEMA 
in the notification process and have 
stated our concerns that FEMA should 
still play a large role in determining 
which households have sustained dam-
age in an affected county. 
Now, this did receive some pushback 
from the majority, and we should defer 
to the assessment of FEMA, the ex-
perts on the ground, before these pro-
ceedings go into effect. 
Ultimately, the majority on the com-
mittee accepted many of our changes

to make sure this legislation is bene-
ficial to consumers, and the bill was 
passed unanimously by the committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this measure 
moving forward, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, once 
again, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1289, the 
PHONE Act. 
As we stand here today, two new, 
fast-moving wildfires, the Glass and 
the Zogg fires, are blazing through my 
home State of California. Thousands of 
people had to evacuate their homes 
yesterday as a result of the fires, some 
of them in the middle of the night. 
Since the beginning of this year, 
there have been over 8,100 wildfires 
that have burned well over 3.7 million 
acres in California alone. Nearly every 
part of the State has been ravaged by 
wildfires this year, and we are now 
only starting to approach what has his-
torically been the most deadly and de-
structive part of wildfire season. 
Worrying 
about 
deadly 
wildfires 
spreading quickly is the new norm that 
my constituents now live in, and wor-
rying about whether they will have to 
evacuate their homes is part of this 
new norm. 
Because of this legislation that we 
are considering today, the PHONE Act, 
which I am proud to cosponsor, my 
constituents, Californians, and Ameri-
cans across the country who are im-
pacted all too frequently now by nat-
ural disasters due to climate change 
will have to worry about one less thing 
when they are forced to evacuate their 
homes, and that is the ability to keep 
their phone numbers. 
Under this legislation, communica-
tions providers will be prohibited from 
reassigning phone numbers of cus-
tomers in areas covered by major nat-
ural disasters and declared disasters 
for the duration of the declaration, and 
that period may be extended. 
The bill would also prohibit providers 
from assessing early termination fees 
to cancel service or connection fees to 
resubscribe at a new address for sub-
scribers whose residence is inaccessible 
or uninhabitable due to a major dis-
aster. 
There is so much that wildfire vic-
tims have to worry about. We need to 
move quickly to ensure that the 
PHONE Act is signed into law, so there 
is one less thing on their plate. 
It may not seem like a big deal, but 
if you lose your home, keeping the 
phone number will be an emotionally 
safe place. Losing your phone number 
after a disaster just adds insult to in-
jury. 
I want to thank my colleague from 
California, Mr. MIKE THOMPSON, for his 
work in creating this legislation. I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers on this matter. I 
would encourage my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support the PHONE 
Act, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I will do 
the same. I urge support of this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in strong support of the bipartisan 
PHONE Act, a bill I started working on more 
than two years ago. 
The PHONE Act is an example of listening 
to our constituents who have been survivors of 
a natural disaster and using the power of leg-
islation to address the aftermath. 
After the devastating 2017 wildfires, one of 
my constituents contacted my office to let us 
know of a problem unique to natural disasters. 
My constituent was one of more than 6,000 
households who lost a home or business to 
the wildfire. This family was a long-time part of 
our community and they wanted to rebuild. 
What they learned was that, during the re-
building process, they would lose the phone 
number they had for years. This may seem 
like something small—a phone number, but to 
my constituent, this was part of the fabric of 
their lives and of their home. 
Unfortunately, the FCC could not save the 
phone number long enough to rebuild. So 
many of our Districts are facing wildfires, hurri-
canes, powerful windstorms and flooding. We 
must do everything we can to help survivors 
reclaim their lives. 
Displaced survivors must find temporary 
housing, connect with family members, re-
place lost documents, apply for disaster as-
sistance, and begin the long process of repair-
ing and rebuilding homes. We may not be 
able to help rebuild or pick up the pieces, but 
this small gesture—reserving a phone num-
ber—can bring the tiniest sense of a return to 
normalcy. 
Preserving home phone numbers means 
survivors have one less worry. It’s one less 
burden. It is the least we can do to help the 
folks in our communities who face such dev-
astation. 
I thank the Committee for its work to bring 
this bill to the Floor and I urge my colleagues 
to vote yes. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 1289, the PHONE Act, a sim-
ple but powerful bill to ensure that Americans 
who lose their homes in natural disasters don’t 
also lose their home phone numbers. 
The CZU Lightning Complex Fire burned 
86,509 acres in my Congressional District, 
making it the 11th most destructive fire in Cali-
fornia history. Seventy-seven thousand of my 
constituents were evacuated. After weeks of 
tireless efforts from over 2,000 local, state, 
and federal firefighters, the fire is now con-
tained. 
While most of the evacuees have returned 
home, nearly 1,000 families in my district 
won’t be returning home because their houses 
were destroyed. It’s these families the PHONE 
Act helps. 
Because climate change is causing in-
creased and more intense wildfires, California 
is experiencing a horrific wildfire season. Al-
ready, over 3.6 million acres have burned from 
nearly 8,000 wildfires. Four of the five largest 
fires in state history happened this year. The 
PHONE Act ensures that the thousands of 
families who lose their homes don’t also lose 
their phone numbers. 
The PHONE Act has three parts. First, if the 
President issues a major disaster declaration, 
and a governor designates a disaster area, 
phone numbers in that designated area cannot 
be reassigned for one year. Second, if some-
one in the disaster area needs more than a 
year, they can get a one-year extension be-
cause rebuilding can take years. Third, the bill 
allows consumers to cancel phone service 
without a cancellation fee if their home is inac-
cessible or uninhabitable. The bill also pro-
hibits resubscription fees if consumers get 
phone service somewhere else in the area. 
Some may ask why we need all of this for 
a simple phone number. One of the first things 
parents teach their kids is their phone number. 
I bet many of us still remember our parents’ 
home phone numbers. While many are opting 
to live with just cellphones, it’s important to 
consider who depends on landlines: older 
Americans and retirees, who often have mul-
tiple doctors, caregivers, and loved ones using 
long-held phone numbers. 
Congressman MIKE THOMPSON authored the 
bill to help the survivors of the Atlas and 
Tubbs fires that ravished his Congressional 
District in 2017. Thousands lost their homes 
and were further frustrated to learn they also 
lost their phone numbers, because phone 
companies had given the numbers away. 
The bill was marked up on March 10, 2020, 
by the Subcommittee and on September 9, 
2020, by the full Energy & Commerce Com-
mittee. At both markups, I offered amend-
ments to ensure the bill would have broad, bi-
partisan support and would be as effective as 
possible. 
The bill is carefully drafted to plug a small 
gap in the law, but this gap means the world 
to our constituents the bill is written to protect. 
The legislation before us is necessary and 
powerful, and I urge my collagues to support 
it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.

titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1754. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1754. 
Horseracing in the United States is 
more than just a sport; it is a tradi-
tion. But far too often, the joy of the 
races is marred by accidents that en-
danger both the horses and the riders. 
Last year, nearly 450 thoroughbred 
racehorses in the United States suf-
fered fatal injuries. The fatality rate in 
the U.S. is between 21⁄2
to 5 times 
greater per race start than the fatality 
rates in Europe and Asia. Some of the 
key reasons for these higher fatality 
rates are our drug policies, training 
and 
race 
protocols, 
and 
racetrack 
standards. 
In the United States, racehorses are 
commonly administered pain medica-
tions to ease discomfort and reduce in-
flammation. These medications may 
mask relatively minor injuries, mak-
ing prerace detection of injuries more 
difficult. 
The stress and pressure generated by 
a 1,100-pound racehorse sprinting at 
speeds up to 40 miles per hour can 
cause minor injuries to become cata-
strophic breaks that ultimately lead to 
a horse’s death. That is why only a 
limited number of pain suppressors are 
permitted to be administered to race-
horses internationally and in the U.S. 
While many permitted pain suppres-
sors are banned from being adminis-
tered several days or even weeks before 
an international horserace, many of 
those same medications are permitted 
to be administered to racehorses a day 
or two before most races start in the 
United States. 
Racehorses need appropriate time to 
recover after intense physical activity 
and should not train or race if suffering 
from soreness, swelling, or pain indic-
ative of a more severe ailment. And 
racehorses should not race or train on 
unsuitable, treacherous tracks. 
Mr. Speaker, horseracing currently 
has no national governing body and is, 
instead, regulated independently by 
each of the 38 States in which the sport 
is 
legal. 
Therefore, 
implementing 
change to address these issues is dif-
ficult. 
The bill, the Horseracing Integrity 
and Safety Act, addresses these chal-
lenges head-on. The bill establishes 
uniform standards for antidoping and 
medication control and racetrack safe-
ty for thoroughbred horseracing. This 
will help ensure that we can maintain 
a safe, thriving horseracing industry. 
It also applies stronger safeguards 
and enforcement against performance- 
enhancing drugs, or PEDs. 
For a sport in which fans place bil-
lions of dollars of bets, trust in the au-
thenticity of competition is crucial. 
The very legitimacy of the sport is un-
dermined if the competitors and public 
cannot trust that all racehorses are 
competing on a level playing field. 
I am pleased that the Humane Soci-
ety, the Jockey Club, the Breeders’ 
Cup, Animal Welfare Action, several 
racetracks, and many horsemen sup-
port this bill. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
TONKO and Consumer Protection and 
Commerce Subcommittee Chair SCHA-
KOWSKY for their tireless leadership on 
this issue. 
The bill is the first step toward a 
safer, fairer horseracing industry, and 
that is a bill I am proud to support. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 1754, 
the Horseracing Integrity and Safety 
Act of 2020. 
From the Pacific Northwest to the 
renowned racetracks in Kentucky, New 
York, and New Jersey, horseracing 
holds a very special place in our cul-
ture and in our local community life. 
In my district alone, thousands of peo-
ple a year travel to Pendleton, Or-
egon—well, most years, other than 
with COVID; in 2020, we didn’t have the 
Pendleton Round-Up, but they do al-
most every other year—to participate 
in the world-famous Pendleton Round- 
Up. So, I am no stranger to the impor-
tant role of horses and horseracing and 
what a role that plays in our lives. 
Currently, horseracing is regulated 
on a State-by-State basis, as you 
heard, and despite the industry’s best 
efforts, some inconsistencies still exist 
in the regulation of horses. This bill is 
designed 
to 
provide 
national 
uni-
formity on antidoping and medication 
programs, as well as racetrack safety 
standards.

horseracing antidoping and medication 
control program as well as a racetrack 
safety program. 
I am pleased to see updates to the 
original Horse Racing Integrity Act 
that my friend Senate Majority Leader 
MITCH MCCONNELL, as well as my col-
leagues Mr. TONKO
and Mr. BARR, 
worked with industry to include. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this improved version, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO). 
Mr. Speaker, let me say how proud 
we are, both he, for representing Sara-
toga, and I, for representing Monmouth 
Park, two very historic race tracks 
that we are very proud of. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety 
Act. 
More than 5 years ago, I, along with 
my good friend and colleague, Rep-
resentative ANDY BARR, introduced the 
first version of this legislation. It has 
been an honor to work with Represent-
ative BARR for many years to get to 
this point that speaks to an industry 
that provides many, many jobs and is a 
deeply rooted bit of history in these 
United States. Now we will move for-
ward with a very good bill. 
I offer my sincere thanks to Chair-
man PALLONE
and Ranking Member 
WALDEN for their support and to also 
echo my support and thanks to our 
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection 
and Commerce chair, JAN SCHAKOWSKY, 
and the ranking member, Representa-
tive RODGERS, for their support and 
guidance, also, throughout this proc-
ess. 
Now, with the support and leadership 
of Majority Leader MCCONNELL
and 
Senator KIRSTEN
GILLIBRAND
in the 
Senate, we are finally poised to cross 
the finish line on this historic reform. 
I need to thank Jeff Morgan, our leg-
islative director in my office, for the 
numerous, numerous hours that he has 
spent on making certain that, as we 
move to the finish line on this process, 
details were addressed and concerns 
were also equally responded to. 
Horseracing, as it has been said, has 
been long woven into the fabric of our 
American culture. Storied names like 
Secretariat, War Admiral, and Man o’ 
War, stir the imagination of racing 
fans not only in this country but all 
over the world. 
In addition to its cultural import, 
horseracing serves as an economic driv-
er in many parts of the country. That 
certainly is true in my congressional 
district, home of the Nation’s oldest 
track, 
the 
fabled 
Saratoga 
Race 
Course. 
The horseracing industry generates 
some $26.1 billion in direct economic 
impact nationwide, including $5 billion 
in my home State of New York. 
In 2015, I had the chance to see, in 
person, the sport at its very best when 
I bore witness to the historic run by 
American Pharaoh in the Belmont to 
capture the Triple Crown. 
When we place a majestic equine ath-
lete like American Pharaoh at the 
forefront, this endeavor can capture, 
truly, the imagination of the Nation, 
and the sport of horseracing can thrive. 
However, we have also seen the dev-
astating results that can occur when 
these equine athletes are pushed be-
yond their limits, often aided by medi-
cations that can mask underlying 
health issues. 
This same story has played out 
countless times across the country be-
cause the current medication reforms 
have been implemented unevenly, leav-
ing patchwork systems in place that 
have created a wide disparity in the ef-
fectiveness of medication testing and 
enforcement 
and 
racetrack 
safety 
standards. 
That 
patchwork 
system 
simply doesn’t work. 
This national approach brings great 
hope to the integrity of this great in-
dustry. If horseracing is to thrive as an 
industry and once again capture the 
public’s imagination, then we must do 
better. So I am, indeed, pleased that 
today, after many years of work, we 
will take those first steps on the road 
to reform. 
Our legislation would recognize the 
horseracing integrity and safety au-
thority as a private, not-for-profit or-
ganization responsible for developing 
and 
implementing 
a 
horseracing 
antidoping and medication control pro-
gram and a racetrack safety program. 
This authority would partner with the 
U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, USADA, to 
develop effective testing protocols, uni-
form standards and penalties, as well 
as proper lab accreditation. 
The board of the authority would 
also include voices representing a spec-
trum of perspectives within the horse-
racing industry, subject to strict con-
flict-of-interest rules, including own-
ers, breeders, horsemen, racetracks, 
and veterinarians. 
The revised legislation would also re-
quire the creation of a national race-
track safety program establishing safe-
ty standards for training and racing; 
racetrack surfaces; injury-related data 
analyses; safety violation investiga-
tion, hearings, and sanctions. Adding a 
racetrack safety component to the bill 
will help make the sport significantly 
safer for our equine athletes and jock-
eys. 
While no legislation is perfect, the 
agreement represented in this bill has 
the support of the overwhelming ma-
jority of not only the horseracing in-
dustry, including all three tracks that 
host Triple Crown races, the Jockey 
Club, and the Breeders’ Cup, but also 
major animal welfare groups like the 
Humane Society, Animal Wellness Ac-
tion, and the grassroots Water Hay 
Oats Alliance. 
Mr. Speaker, this is truly a win-win- 
win for the industry, sports fans, and 
our equine athletes. It puts the equine 
athlete at the epicenter of this legisla-
tion and concern. It is safer as an out-
come for our jockeys, important in 
that sport, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1754. 
Again, I thank the chairman of the 
committee, FRANK PALLONE, for bring-
ing this forward and all who have 
worked so steadfastly on the results 
that we have achieved today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SCANLON). Without objection, the gen-
tlewoman from Washington will con-
trol the minority’s time. 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation has 
been a huge priority for the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). He has 
done a lot of work on it. He proudly 
represents horse country in Kentucky. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the majestic and time-honored 
sport of thoroughbred racing, a beloved 
tradition in the United States since the 
early days of the Republic and the sig-
nature industry of my home State, the 
Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
Sometimes referred to as the sport of 
kings, Americans—and I would dare to 
say, 
especially 
Kentuckians—have 
made this the sport of all Americans 
through the inspiring stories of amaz-
ing athletes with names like Sir Bar-
ton, Man o’ War, War Admiral, Secre-
tariat, Seattle Slew, Affirmed, Amer-
ican Pharaoh, and Justify in recent 
years. 
To that end, I further rise in favor of 
H.R. 1754, the Horseracing Integrity 
and Safety Act, bipartisan legislation 
that I introduced in one form or an-
other during the last three terms of 
Congress with my colleague and good 
friend, the gentleman from New York, 
PAUL TONKO. I thank Paul for his part-
nership in this long, tireless effort. 
After many years of negotiation and 
deliberation, today I stand proud to fi-
nally bring this legislation to the 
House floor for a vote. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I 
have worked diligently to enact poli-
cies 
that 
will 
promote 
economic 
growth and investment in this key 
Kentucky industry. My district, Ken-
tucky’s Sixth Congressional District, 
well-known as the Horse Capital of the 
World, is home to more than 400 horse 
farms and the world-famous Keeneland 
Race Course in Lexington, Kentucky, 
which not only serves as the global 
leader in breeding stock sales, but also 
hosts many notable races, including 
the great Toyota Blue Grass Stakes 
and Breeders’ Cup, which will be, once 
again, held at the racetrack this No-
vember. 
Many of my constituents have a close 
connection to and an affinity for both 
Keeneland and thoroughbred racing. 
My own grandfather, J.B. Faulconer, 
was Keeneland’s first publicist and 
later the vice president of the Thor-
oughbred Racing Associations in New

York, where he was credited with nam-
ing the Eclipse Awards. 
Several years ago, as I reviewed the 
minutes of the Jockey Club roundtable 
meetings when my grandfather was ac-
tive in the industry, I noticed that, 
even then, four and five decades ago, 
leaders in the industry lamented the 
lack of unity among the various con-
stituencies within the industry. They 
regretted the fact that there wasn’t 
uniformity in the rules of racing, and 
particularly in medication rules. 
Thoroughbred racing is not just 
about our culture and heritage. There 
has always been immense pride in the 
enormous contributions of this great 
sport to American culture. But it is 
also a major source of jobs and eco-
nomic opportunity for our people. In 
fact, the industry is responsible for 
44,100 direct jobs and over 16,000 indi-
rect jobs in Kentucky alone. 
With the privilege of representing 
this unique industry comes the respon-
sibility of fighting for its future. This 
sport is not solely relevant in those 
States that are home to the Triple 
Crown, like Kentucky, Maryland, and 
New York. Horseracing is very much a 
national sport, prominent in places 
like California, Florida, Arkansas, New 
Jersey, Illinois, and Louisiana. 
The horse industry contributes ap-
proximately $26 billion, as my friend, 
PAUL TONKO, pointed out, but in some 
estimates, up to $50 billion in direct 
economic impact to the U.S. economy; 
and it has a direct employment impact 
of 988,394 jobs. Therefore, advocating 
for this industry requires more than 
just celebrating its proud heritage. 
I have always believed that the fu-
ture prosperity of this sport depends on 
uniformity of the rules of racing. Cur-
rently, as has been noted, regulated by 
38 separate racing jurisdictions, the 
thoroughbred horseracing industry la-
bors under a patchwork of conflicting 
and inconsistent State-based rules gov-
erning prohibited substances, lab ac-
creditation, testing, and penalties for 
violations. 
This lack of uniformity has impeded 
interstate 
commerce; 
it 
has 
com-
promised the international competi-
tiveness of the industry; it has under-
mined public confidence in the safety 
and integrity of the sport; and the in-
dustry is in desperate need of cer-
tainty. 
As a conservative who believes in fed-
eralism and States’ rights, I, neverthe-
less, understand that the Constitution 
gives Congress the power to regulate 
interstate commerce precisely for the 
purpose of eliminating these kinds of 
impediments to interstate exchange. 
As I have said many times, as a lim-
ited government conservative, this leg-
islative effort is not about more regu-
lation. It is about creating a single, na-
tionwide set of rules that will result in 
smarter, more effective, and stream-
lined regulation for the industry. 
The Horseracing Integrity and Safety 
Act will remedy this lack of uni-
formity, the issue central to maintain-
ing the integrity of the sport, by au-
thorizing the creation of a nongovern-
mental regulatory safety authority and 
fairness, governed by representatives of 
all major constituencies of the indus-
try and responsible for implementing a 
national uniform medication and track 
safety program. 
Specifically, the legislation would 
recognize the horseracing integrity and 
safety authority, which will be tasked 
with creating uniform national stand-
ards regarding prohibited and per-
mitted substances for use in race 
horses, establishing an accreditation 
system for laboratories to test drug 
samples, 
and 
developing 
regional 
standards for racetrack safety. 
As I have said, this legislation builds 
on the bipartisan legislation Rep-
resentative TONKO and I have intro-
duced in previous Congresses and incor-
porates feedback from an expanded 
group of industry stakeholders to enact 
these much-needed reforms that will 
protect the safety of our equine and 
human athletes. 
I want to thank the coalition of orga-
nizations that have supported this leg-
islation from the very beginning, in-
cluding the Water Hay Oats Alliance; a 
special thanks goes to Arthur and 
Staci Hancock, my constituents, of 
Stone Farm in Bourbon County, Ken-
tucky, for their tireless and relentless 
persistence and advocacy; the Jockey 
Club; 
Breeders’ 
Cup 
International, 
headquartered 
in 
my 
district; 
Keeneland, 
Kentucky 
Thoroughbred 
Association; the Thoroughbred Owners 
and Breeders Association; and the 
Jockeys’ Guild, because the jockeys 
know how important safety is, with a 
special mention of Chris McCarron, for 
advocating for their fellow jockeys and 
their safety. 
I also want to thank members of our 
expanded coalition, including CEO Bill 
Carstanjen and the board of directors 
of Churchill Downs International and 
prominent trainer Dale Romans. 
I want to thank Ed Whitfield, former 
Member of Congress from Kentucky, 
who really trailblazed on this issue. 
I want to thank Senate Majority 
Leader MITCH MCCONNELL for his lead-
ership in not only introducing com-
panion legislation, but legislation that 
I believe materially improves on our 
previous versions by adding a focus on 
track surface safety and by making 
reasonable minor changes that have 
enabled us to enlarge our coalition of 
support and bring more organizations 
within the industry together in support 
of our legislation. 
Madam Speaker, the Horseracing In-
tegrity and Safety Act was developed 
through a highly deliberative and bi-
partisan process and takes into consid-
eration a diversity of perspectives from 
all parts of the industry. I appreciate 
the willingness of all constituencies 
within the industry to compromise and 
to forge a consensus product. This was 
not easy, but it was necessary to get us 
to this historic day for this great sport. 
b 1315 
The result is support from the major-
ity of Members of this House and Sen-
ator 
MCCONNELL’s 
bipartisan 
com-
panion legislation in the Senate. 
Today’s vote is a vitally important 
step in advancing reforms to protect 
our equine athletes and jockeys, to en-
sure confidence in the safety and integ-
rity of the sport within the majority of 
the wagering public, and enable the in-
dustry to attract a new generation of 
fans and investors to strengthen the 
thoroughbred breed. 
And because this is truly an inter-
national sport and industry, this bill 
will make American thoroughbred rac-
ing and breeding stronger and more 
internationally competitive. And it 
will also secure thousands of both di-
rect and indirect jobs in the Sixth Con-
gressional District and beyond that de-
pend on a thriving thoroughbred horse-
racing and breeding industry. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
PALLONE
for his leadership on this 
issue, Ranking Member WALDEN
for 
joining to help shepherd this legisla-
tion through the process, and espe-
cially, again, my good friend, PAUL 
TONKO, who represents a great Amer-
ican racecourse in Saratoga Springs. 
I really appreciate, in this time of ad-
mitted partisanship and polarization, 
an opportunity for this country to 
come together and unite behind a great 
cause. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the Horseracing In-
tegrity and Safety Act. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY), the chairwoman of the 
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection 
and Commerce, who has been a tireless 
leader on this issue, and, in particular, 
for the protection of animals. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 1754, the Horse-
racing Integrity Act, and the really 
amazing, relentless work that my col-
leagues, PAUL TONKO and Mr. BARR, 
have exerted all session this year, last 
year, the year before, to make this a 
reality. 
Madam Speaker, compromise is often 
hard to find. And the number of stake-
holders that have been involved has 
made it even more complicated but, fi-
nally, successful. This legislation is the 
result of that compromise. The amend-
ment includes such important improve-
ments in establishing safety, not only 
for the equine athletes, our horses, but 
also for the jockeys. 
Madam Speaker, you have heard a lot 
from both of the chief sponsors on this 
legislation, but I want to say that this 
bill will help achieve our overarching 
goal to protect the health and welfare 
of our racehorses and jockeys while 
strengthening the integrity of the 
sport itself, which is so important.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4983 
September 29, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I want to emphasize 
something that Mr. TONKO was talking 
about, because let’s not forget why we 
are here. Racehorses in the United 
States are injured at a much higher 
rate than the rest of the horse-racing 
world, resulting in nearly 500 horses 
dying every year. 
One of the keys to stopping injuries 
and deaths is establishing strong drug 
policies, training, and racing protocols 
and racetrack standards. Standards 
like pre-race detection and appropriate 
treatment for injuries. The stress and 
pressure generated by an 1,100-pound 
animal sprinting down the track at, 
sometimes a rate of up to 40 miles an 
hour, can cause minor injuries to be-
come fatal breaks. 
Madam Speaker, as a former horse 
owner myself, and my horse came from 
a track not among the names that Mr. 
BARR listed—actually, he was probably 
thrown off the track, he wasn’t very 
good—and came to the barn that I 
would go to. And I had the pleasure of 
having some years of the rest of his life 
for him to be my horse—BJ Sullivan. 
He would take me down the paths in 
the forest preserve and he also helped 
me learn how to jump over fences, not 
too high, but pretty well. And I think 
sometimes, until this piece of legisla-
tion, maybe he was kind of lucky not 
to be one of the winners, and not to be 
one of the ones who would be drugged 
and not protected. And as the stand-in 
jockey, I was pretty safe on the back of 
BJ Sullivan, who was very honest when 
it came to jumping over fences. 
Madam Speaker, I am very, very 
proud today. Rather than treating the 
underlying conditions, some racehorses 
are given pain medications to ease 
their pain, and the pain medications 
mask the relatively minor injuries that 
could actually become much more seri-
ous. 
This legislation, as you heard in de-
tail, I think is the kind of legislation 
that is really going to enhance the in-
dustry and enhance the safety of rid-
ers, of jockeys, as well as our horses. 
Madam Speaker, I am so proud to be 
a cosponsor of the bill, and I thank our 
lead sponsors. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank everyone 
who spoke. I know that Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY is such a champion for ani-
mals—horses and other animals. And, 
of course, Mr. TONKO has worked so 
hard and aggressively—I guess is the 
best way to put it—on this legislation. 
But also, when I listen to Mr. BARR, my 
colleague from Kentucky, talk about 
Kentucky and racetracks, I could just 
as easily have substituted Monmouth 
Park, which is my thoroughbred track, 
for almost everything he said. 
Monmouth Park is less than a mile 
from my district office in my home-
town. My father, my uncle—so many 
people in my family—either worked 
there or bet there or enjoyed the horses 
there. 
But 
particularly 
when 
you 
talked about the industry, in my home 
county, which is Monmouth County, it 
is not only a question of jobs, which 
there are so many that depend on the 
track, but also open space. 
As you know, New Jersey is the most 
densely populated State. And we are in 
part of the State that still has a lot of 
farms, but most of them are horse 
farms. And without those horse farms, 
the very character of Monmouth Coun-
ty would not be the same. Whether it is 
the economics, whether it is open 
space, or it is just a tradition, this bill 
makes it possible, in my opinion, for 
that to continue. And, hopefully, as 
Mr. BARR said, open up to new fans as 
well. 
Madam Speaker, this is a very impor-
tant piece of legislation, and I urge my 
colleagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1754, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

tlewoman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 8134. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to speak in support of H.R. 8134, 
the Consumer Product Safety Inspec-
tion Enhancement Act, and I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this bipartisan leg-
islation was introduced by Consumer 
Protection 
and 
Commerce 
Sub-
committee chair JAN SCHAKOWSKY and 
Representative JEFF DUNCAN and ad-
vanced out of the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce on September 9 by 
a voice vote. 
This important legislation will em-
power the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission with the data it needs to 
protect Americans from the flood of 
unsafe products entering our Nation 
from overseas, especially e-commerce 
shipments entering under the de mini-
mis value exemption. It will also help 
ensure the Commission has adequate 
staffing to support these efforts. 
Madam Speaker, e-commerce spend-
ing 
has 
risen 
steeply 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic as Americans turn 
to online shopping to safely get needed 
goods or to find scarce supplies. Even 
before the pandemic, however, the 
CPSC was projecting that the number 
of e-commerce shipments to the United 
States would soon reach 60 million per 
year and represent well over 50 percent 
of the total volume of imports under 
the agency’s jurisdiction. 
Despite the rapid growth in e-com-
merce, these shipments entering the 
U.S. from overseas continue to face lit-
tle scrutiny at our ports and often con-
tain fake or dangerous products. 
Currently, 
CPSC 
inspectors 
are 
present at only 6 percent of U.S. ports 
and concentrated only at seaports that 
receive large, high-value shipping con-
tainers. The agency virtually has no 
presence at the kinds of ports where 
millions 
of 
e-commerce 
shipments 
enter the United States, such as ex-
press courier facilities, international 
mail facilities, and airports. 
We need CPSC inspectors stationed 
in all these types of places to prevent 
unsafe products from entering the U.S. 
and harming Americans. CPSC will 
also need more data and more advanced 
IT infrastructure in order to properly 
assess risk and target potentially un-
safe e-commerce shipments. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 8134 addresses 
all these issues. It expands CPSC’s 
presence at ports, to include the type 
of ports where e-commerce shipments 
enter. It also empowers the CPSC to 
collect the data it needs to identify and 
block e-commerce shipments that dis-
regard our consumer product safety 
laws and standards. 
This bill would protect American 
consumers from unsafe consumer prod-
ucts, at the same time an expanded and 
enhanced import surveillance program 
will also protect manufacturers and re-
tailers from having to carry out costly 
recalls. 
Madam Speaker, I, again, commend 
Chairwoman SCHAKOWSKY
and Rep-
resentative DUNCAN
for introducing 
this bill. I also thank Ranking Member 
WALDEN
and subcommittee Ranking 
Member RODGERS for working with us 
to move this bill through the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce on a 
bipartisan basis. 
Madam Speaker, I call on my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 8134, 
the Consumer Product Safety Inspec-
tion Enhancement Act. 
This bill will give the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission important 
tools to crack down on unsafe and 
counterfeit products at our Nation’s 
ports. 
As dangerous items and products 
that infringe on our companies’ intel-
lectual property flow into the country 
from China and other countries, it is 
essential that we empower the CPSC to 
find these products before they enter 
the country. 
Madam Speaker, I applaud Mr. DUN-
CAN and Chair SCHAKOWSKY for their 
leadership, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY), the subcommittee chair-
woman. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for yielding to 
me. I rise in strong support of H.R. 
8134, the Consumer Product Safety In-
spection Enhancement Act, a bill that 
I introduced with my friend and col-
league, JEFF DUNCAN. 
E-commerce 
spending 
is 
surging 
right now during the COVID–19 pan-
demic as Americans turn to online 
shopping for household essentials, per-
sonal protective equipment, back-to- 
school supplies, and more. 
However, e-commerce shipments en-
tering the United States from overseas 
face little scrutiny and often contain 
fake or dangerous products. It is time 
that we empower the Consumer Prod-
uct Safety Commission to collect the 
data it needs to identify and block e- 
commerce shipments that can harm 
consumers and that don’t offer the pro-
tection and safety that they need. 
b 1330 
This legislation would give the CPSC 
the data that it needs to protect Amer-
icans from the flood of unsafe products 
that are coming in. 
This legislation is a critical first step 
to restoring confidence in e-commerce 
sites, but this bill is not a silver bullet. 
Much more needs to happen. 
Earlier this month, CNN reported 
that products sold on Amazon had 
burst into flames, causing significant 
bodily harm and property damage as 
well. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD that article.

[From CNN, Sept. 10, 2020] 
DOZENS
OF AMAZON’S OWN PRODUCTS HAVE 
BEEN REPORTED AS DANGEROUS—MELTING, 
EXPLODING
OR
EVEN
BURSTING
INTO 
FLAMES. MANY ARE STILL ON THE MARKET 
(By Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken) 
(CNN) When firefighters arrived at Austin 
Parra’s home on January 12, 2017, they could 
see smoke and the charred remnants of an 
office chair outside. 
Parra, then 20, had been transported to the 
hospital. His mother explained to fire-
fighters that her son’s chair caught on fire 
while he was sleeping, and he was burned as 
he carried the flaming chair outside. 
Anthony Dignoti, the Wethersfield, Con-
necticut, fire marshal in charge of inves-
tigating the incident, could see that the door 
and door frame were damaged by the fire as 
well. He noticed bowls strewn about, which 
he wrote in his official report had been filled 
with water in an attempt to extinguish the 
fire. 
The fire at Austin Parra’s home originated 
with an AmazonBasics USB cord, Fire Mar-
shal Anthony Dignoti determined. (Courtesy 
Wethersfield Fire Marshal’s Office) 
But most interesting to Dignoti was a 
white USB cord, Part of the cord was hang-
ing off the chair and still intact, but the 
other side was stuck to the seat and had 
melted into a bare wire, he said in his report 
and an interview with CNN. 
Dignoti ultimately concluded that the fire 
originated with the cord Parra was using to 
charge his cellphone. His report stated the 
cord experienced a short circuit, and while it 
was unclear why this happened, ‘‘the heat 
produced by the cord ignited the upholstery 
for the office chair.’’ 
The cord had been branded with the name 
of the world’s largest online retailer: Ama-
zon. It was sold by one of Amazon’s popular 
private label lines, AmazonBasics, which of-
fers budget-friendly products including con-
sumer 
electronics, 
household 
appliances, 
home goods and office accessories. 
Launched in 2009, AmazonBasics has grown 
to offer more than 5,000 products, according 
to the retailer. Its mission: identifying ev-
eryday items that Amazon can create at a 
similar or higher quality and lower price 
point when compared to existing name 
brands—a strategy also employed by compa-
nies such as Costco and Target. 
KEY FINDINGS 
Using keywords including ‘‘fire,’’ ‘‘dan-
gerous’’ and ‘‘burn,’’ reporters identified 
more than 1,500 reviews about AmazonBasics 
electronics and appliances posted by US cus-
tomers on Amazon.com from 2016 through 
early 
2020 
that 
described 
safety-related 
issues. 
More than 10 percent of the reviews identi-
fied by CNN reported that products had 
caught fire—in some cases describing how 
flames shot out of the devices. 
Nearly 200 included reports of damage to 
homes or belongings, including charred walls 
and fried cellphones. 
A growing number of AmazonBasics prod-
ucts, which the company promotes heavily 
on its site, have become bestsellers since the 
line’s inception, and many have ratings 
above four stars, according to Marketplace 
Pulse research. In recent months, the online 
retailer’s sales have been soaring as millions 
of Americans have been staying at home— 
and in many cases working remotely—during 
the ongoing pandemic. 
But consumers have raised serious safety 
concerns about AmazonBasics items in com-
plaints to government regulators and in re-
views posted on Amazon’s own website. Since 
2016, at least 1,500 reviews, covering more 
than 70 items, have described products ex-
ploding, catching on fire, smoking, melting, 
causing electrical malfunctions or otherwise 
posing risks, according to an analysis of 
AmazonBasics electronics and appliances 
listed on its website. 
The reviews identified represent a small 
fraction of the overall purchases of the prod-
ucts, and fires caused by consumer elec-
tronics are not unique to Amazon branded 
items. User error can also be a factor, as can 
faulty or aging wiring within a home or a de-
fective device being used in conjunction with 
the product. 
But when well-made and used properly by 
consumers, electronics like those sold under 
the AmazonBasics name should rarely pose 
dangers, said electrical engineers inter-
viewed by CNN. 
Dozens 
of 
AmazonBasics 
product 
are 
flagged as dangerous, but many are still 
being sold. Within the more than 1,500 re-
views, many consumers explicitly called out 
items as potentially dangerous—using terms 
such as ‘‘hazard’’ or ‘‘fire’’ or saying the 
product should be recalled. Around 30 items 
with three or more reviews like this remain 
for sale on Amazon.com today. At least 11 
other products that fit this criteria were no 
longer for sale at the time of publication. 
Some became unavailable after CNN began 
its reporting, and at least four product pages 
were removed from the retailer’s site en-
tirely—leaving behind dead URLs known by 
employees as ‘‘dog pages.’’ Amazon con-
firmed that at least eight of these products 
had been under investigation, but said the 
company determined they all met its safety 
standards. 
Customers have written in their reviews 
and said in interviews that they trusted that 
AmazonBasics purchases would be safe and 
well made since they were branded with 
Amazon’s name and frequently touted as 
‘‘Amazon’s Choice.’’ But even as complaints 
have mounted, the company has provided lit-
tle or no information to consumers or the 
public about how it is handling allegations 
that some of its merchandise is unsafe. 
This 
review 
was 
written 
about 
an 
AmazonBasics car charger that has multiple 
consumer safety complaints. 
Amazon shoppers have recounted fright-
ening malfunctions and close calls in vivid 
detail: A surge protector turned into a 
‘‘blowtorch,’’ one father recalled—saying 
that flames shot out of the device, which was 
near his baby’s nursery. Phone chargers were 
said to have burned peoples’ hands and legs, 
and exploding batteries allegedly sprayed 
chemicals in someone’s face. A USB cord 
burst into flames in a parked car while a tod-
dler was inside, according to one parent. A 
charger in another car was reported as start-
ing an electrical fire on the freeway, alleg-
edly burning the driver and a jacket. Paper 
shredders turned on by themselves, accord-
ing to multiple consumers, and one report-
edly blew up in a ‘‘fireball,’’ burning some-
one’s arm and singeing the hair off. And a 
microwave suddenly caught on fire when an 
8-year-old went to heat up her macaroni and 
cheese cup as she had done ‘‘a zillion times,’’ 
a mother claimed, saying she had to take the 
appliance outside and spray it with a hose. 
Each of these purchases were ‘‘verified,’’ 
meaning Amazon confirmed that the cus-
tomer who wrote the review actually pur-
chased the product on the site and didn’t re-
ceive a ‘‘deep discount,’’ according to its 
website. 
Several 
were 
accompanied 
by 
photos of the burned items. 
More 
than 
150 
reviews 
about 
the 
AmazonBasics microwave describe safety 
concerns including flames and smoke. 
While the best way to determine why 
something malfunctioned is to physically 
test it and take it apart, many customers 
said they immediately threw out the defec-
tive devices or sent them back to Amazon at 
the company’s request. 
CNN obtained two damaged AmazonBasics 
products from customers: a microwave that 
a customer said caught fire and a USB cord 
a user said overheated and melted. These 
were tested by researchers at the failure 
analysis lab at the University of Maryland’s 
Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering 
(CALCE) at CNN’s request. 
The USB cord was too burned for research-
ers to determine what had gone wrong. The 
microwave testing found that the design of 
the panel covering the heating device inside 
the microwave could result in the machine 
catching on fire, and determined that the 
way the panel was secured could allow debris 
such as food or grease to collect behind it 
and possibly ignite. As soon as the research-
ers turned it on, the microwave began spark-
ing and smoking, causing it to react as if its 
user put foil or other metal inside. The test-
ing was cut short when the lab was closed 
due to Covid–19. 
‘‘There’s a risk in using this machine for 
sure, and it’s a safety risk because this clear-
ly heated up to the extent a fire could 
occur,’’ said engineering professor Michael 
Pecht, who is the founder of CALCE and has 
previously assisted in government safety in-
vestigations. ‘‘This is more than a reliability 
problem, this is a potential safety problem.’’ 
Amazon did not comment on whether any 
improvements had been made to the micro-
wave, but said it is confident the microwave 
is safe to use and that it continues to ‘‘meet 
or exceed’’ all of the applicable certification 
requirements. 
The retailer said ‘‘safety is a top priority’’ 
at the company and that it takes a number 
of steps to ensure all AmazonBasics products 
are safe and high quality, such as selecting 
experienced manufacturers, monitoring cus-
tomer feedback and testing items to ensure 
they pass safety and compliance standards 
both before and after they are available. It 
also said AmazonBasics offers thousands of 
products which combined have more than 1 
million reviews, and that concerns are thor-
oughly investigated and that the company 
acts accordingly. 
‘‘Not safe,’’ one verified purchaser wrote in 
a review about an AmazonBasics microwave, 
including a home video that shows the device 
sparking and making loud popping noises. 
‘‘The outcome of the investigation varies 
on a case by case basis and may include re-
moving the product from the store, adjusting 
the design of the product, notifying cus-
tomers to stop using the product, or other 
appropriate action,’’ a company spokes-
person said in a statement. ‘‘We want cus-
tomers to shop with confidence and if ever a 
customer has a concern, they can contact 
customer service and we will investigate.’’ 
Amazon said there are a number of reasons 
an item may no longer be available, but that 
customers will be notified if a critical safety 
issue is identified. When asked how fre-
quently the company has done this, Amazon 
said it had notified customers about an 
AmazonBasics product less than five times. 
It did not specify whether it did this for any 
of the items reviewed by CNN. 
‘IT’S A RED FLAG’ 
Amazon has already been under intense 
scrutiny for allowing third party sellers with 
allegedly dangerous offerings to do business 
on the site, and multiple court rulings have 
found that the retailer can be held liable for 
defective items sold in its third party mar-
ketplace. CNN’s analysis focused on products 
sold with Amazon’s own name on them—a 
growing part of the retailer’s business. 
The reviews come from people living all 
over the United States and span five years, 
but they often call attention to the very

same problems: The same panel within a 
microwave catching fire, USB cords melting 
or burning despite no visible wear and tear 
or overuse, and paint on outdoor patio heat-
ers lighting on fire. Consumers alleged items 
malfunctioned the first time they plugged 
them in. Others said electronics were not in 
use when they began malfunctioning. 
In general, one or two reports of problems 
could be more easily chalked up to user error 
or other external factors, multiple electrical 
engineers said. But as the number of reports 
about the same kinds of failures increases 
about the same item, so does the likelihood 
that there is a defect in the design or manu-
facturing. 
Researchers at the CALCE lab compare a 
new AmazonBasics microwave to one that 
had visible burn damage. 
‘‘That would certainly lead to more sus-
picion that the product is at fault,’’ said 
Mark Horenstein, a professor at Boston Uni-
versity’s College of Engineering. ‘‘It’s a red 
flag.’’ Amazon said customer reviews are 
only one indication of a potential issue, say-
ing it looks at a number of other factors 
such as sales history, returns and customer 
service contacts when assessing potential 
problems. ‘‘Using customer reviews alone to 
conclude a product is unsafe or imply there’s 
a widespread issue is misleading,’’ the com-
pany said in a statement. Former Amazon 
employees said that even a few reviews men-
tioning words like ‘‘fire’’ and ‘‘hazard’’ 
should automatically prompt the retailer to 
take action. Amazon said reviews are mon-
itored and can trigger safety investigations, 
but it declined to provide details about the 
specific threshold needed for this to happen. 
The company said products may be tempo-
rarily removed during such inquiries and 
that in order to keep selling something, it 
must be confirmed to be safe. It also said 
that if an investigation uncovers a ‘‘poten-
tial, non-isolated safety issue,’’ it takes ap-
propriate measures to notify the government 
and 
‘‘safely 
recall 
the 
product.’’ 
This 
AmazonBasics surge protector remains for 
sale despite reviews about dangers and a re-
port to the CPSC that it ‘‘made a loud pop-
ping noise, sparked, and the case was opened 
by the force of the damage.’’ Amazon said 
the product is safe and that most reports in-
volved customers who plugged in multiple 
large electronics. Some reviews identified by 
CNN said nothing was plugged into the de-
vice, however. 
Businesses are required by law to imme-
diately report ‘‘potentially hazardous’’ items 
to the federal Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (CPSC) so the agency can deter-
mine whether an official recall is necessary. 
Companies can also initiate voluntary re-
calls in cooperation with the CPSC. Concerns 
similar to those detailed in Amazon reviews 
have been relayed to the CPSC in at least 10 
reports 
that 
specifically 
mention 
an 
AmazonBasics 
product. 
The 
complaints 
cover at least eight different items and date 
back to 2012. 
In the United States, Amazon publicly re-
called two AmazonBasics items in 2018 and 
2019, after the company received 53 reports in 
the US about power banks overheating and 
25 about versions of a space heater over-
heating, burning or sparking. It said it 
proactively notified the CPSC of the results 
of the company’s own investigation and its 
intent to recall the items. Beyond these two 
official recalls, the company has never pub-
licly acknowledged that AmazonBasics prod-
ucts have any safety issues. 
The CPSC said it was prohibited by law 
from discussing any item that had not been 
recalled and that in general, the agency de-
termines if a recall is necessary based on a 
number of factors, including ‘‘the nature of 
the defect, the level of hazard associated 
with the issue, and the pattern of similar 
problems (seen).’’ 
Customers 
reported 
being 
shocked 
or 
burned in at least 100 reviews on Amazon’s 
website. Parra from the Connecticut apart-
ment fire said in a lawsuit that he suffered 
second-degree burns and injuries to his 
throat from smoke inhalation. Dignoti’s re-
port shows Parra spent around a day in the 
hospital. Parra sued Amazon in 2019, and the 
case settled. He and his attorney did not re-
spond to interview requests. 
CNN used the information provided by the 
fire department to determine that the type 
of cord Parra purchased had been removed 
from Amazon’s website. While it is unclear 
when the cord was pulled, a version of the 
page captured by the Wayback Machine, an 
internet archive, shows the product had an 
average rating of 4.1 out of 5 stars. It shows 
the cord was still available for purchase 
until at least June 2017, and that there were 
warnings from other customers at least a 
year before Parra’s January 2017 fire. 
The link for the phone cord used by Parra 
now leads to nothing but a dead URL known 
internally at Amazon as a dog page. 
‘‘End of the cable melted and started 
smoking. Glad we caught it before a fire,’’ 
one verified purchaser wrote in June 2016. 
‘‘DO NOT BUY! FIRE HAZARD!’’ another 
customer with a verified purchase of the cord 
wrote in May 2016, attaching 10 photos of the 
melted and warped cord—saying it ruined an 
expensive iPhone and that he considered 
himself lucky that a fire hadn’t ignited. 
‘‘These should be taken off the market im-
mediately!!!’’ 
While fires caused by USB cords are un-
common, they are possible, according to 
electrical engineers who said a range of fac-
tors could be at play in situations like this— 
from problems with whatever device the cord 
is plugged into to defects within the cord 
itself. 
The AmazonBasics lightning charger that 
this review was written about became un-
available after CNN began its reporting. 
An industry non-profit, the USB Imple-
menters Forum Inc, said it docs not believe 
user error is a significant cause of over-
heating USB cables. A cable that is sub-
standard, whether because of a design or 
manufacturing defect, can be dangerous and 
lead to electric shock, overheating, sparks or 
fire, it said. The group has certified a num-
ber of AmazonBasics cables as meeting their 
standards, 
though 
it 
focuses 
on 
the 
functionality of the cables and making sure 
their specifications are in compliance—em-
phasizing that it is ‘‘not a replacement for 
industry best practices or any applicable 
local, state or government statutes, rules or 
regulations pertaining to safety.’’ 
The group also said it conducted an inter-
nal review of several cables CNN brought to 
its attention and found them to be compli-
ant. It does not certify proprietary lightning 
USB cords used for Apple devices, however, 
such as Parra’s cord. Apple said it allows 
manufacturers to use its lightning connec-
tors in their products if those items are test-
ed and confirmed to meet high quality stand-
ards, and that the company expects manu-
facturers to meet any applicable safety 
standards. 
HAVE YOU PURCHASED AN AMAZONBASICS 
PRODUCT? 
Amazon meanwhile said it investigated the 
safety claims about the kind of cord used by 
Parra and determined it met the company’s 
standards. ‘‘If we determine that a product is 
unsafe, we remove it from our stores and 
take all necessary actions, which may in-
clude contacting regulators and customers,’’ 
it said, specifically in response to questions 
about the cord used by Parra, which was re-
moved from the site. 
The retailer did introduce a new version of 
the product, however, saying it made up-
dates to improve the customer experience. 
LOSING TRUST 
Matt Citro purchased his AmazonBasics 
surge protector to protect his family from a 
fire. Instead, he said that in January 2018, 
the surge protector itself caught fire. A sin-
gle phone charger was plugged into the de-
vice, but was not being used at the time. 
Sitting on the couch as his 9–month-old 
son slept in his nursery nearby, Citro said he 
noticed flames coming out of the surge pro-
tector—turning it into what resembled a 
‘‘blowtorch.’’ He told CNN that he quickly 
pulled the flaming device from the wall. He 
wasn’t injured but said he was left with more 
than $1,000 of damage after the surge pro-
tector burned a hole in the wall outlet and 
seared part of his wall. 
Matt Citro says that he sent back his 
charred surge protector so that it could be 
investigated by Amazon. He never heard any-
thing back, but did receive a payment to 
cover damage to his home. (Courtesy Matt 
Citro) 
He had never experienced any electrical 
issues in his home before this, he said, and 
was convinced the AmazonBasics surge pro-
tector was to blame. 
‘‘DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! . . . If I 
wasn’t home my entire house would have 
burnt down from this cheap product,’’ Citro 
wrote in a review. ‘‘I’m extremely dis-
appointed in Amazon. We put a lot of faith in 
their products and to have (one) almost burn 
down my home does not make me trust 
them. This product has amazons name on 
it!’’ 
Citro said he immediately contacted Ama-
zon and told the company what happened. At 
first, he said he was offered a replacement or 
a refund. Not satisfied, he continued to call 
customer service. 
He said he finally got through to someone 
who connected him with an insurance com-
pany, and he was ultimately paid $1,469, ac-
cording to a settlement document reviewed 
by CNN in which Amazon denies any liabil-
ity. 
Amazon continued to sell the surge pro-
tector for nearly two years after Citro posted 
his review, during which time more reviews 
about similar situations and other concerns 
piled up. More than 40 customers reported 
that the product was a fire hazard, had 
caused damage to their home or belongings 
or described other dangers. 
These reviews represented around 1.7% of 
the roughly 2,600 US reviews posted about 
the $10.99 device as of late last year, before 
Amazon removed it from the site. Several in-
cluded claims of flames and fires like Citro’s. 
As a comparison, a similar product made by 
a major consumer electronics company and 
also sold on Amazon’s site had six reviews 
about possible safety concerns earlier this 
year, representing .07% of its more than 8,000 
reviews. And none of the six mentioned ac-
tual fires. Amazon said its own analysis, 
which 
added 
global 
reviews 
about 
the 
AmazonBasics surge protector, found 1.1 % 
involved claims of overheating, fire and 
other dangers. 
One former AmazonBasics product man-
ager, who asked to remain anonymous be-
cause she still works in the industry, said 
she was surprised to hear that such a high 
percentage of reviews raised safety issues 
about an AmazonBasics item. ‘‘Once you get 
40, oh my gosh, no, that would not be accept-
able in any shape, way or form,’’ she said of 
the reviews found by CNN, adding that a 
ratio of around .05% would have been seen as 
more acceptable when she worked there. But 
she defended her former employer, saying 
this was just one product and that during her

September 29, 2020 
time with the company, she believed the re-
tailer was even more vigilant than competi-
tors in trying to react to safety concerns. 
More than 40 customers reported dangers 
involving the same surge protector that 
Citro said burst into flames. 
Weeks after CNN began reporting on the 
surge protector—reaching out to customers 
and employees and ordering the same item 
as part of the investigation—Amazon pulled 
it from its site in December despite its high 
average rating of 4.4 stars as of a month ear-
lier. The company did not appear to provide 
any notification to customers, including to 
the reporters who purchased it. And it did 
not post any message on its site about why 
it was taken down. 
Amazon declined to comment on individual 
customers, and would not say why the page 
was removed or whether Citro’s surge pro-
tector was tested. It did say an updated 
version of the product had been released, but 
when asked for the link to the updated 
version, the company said ‘‘this product is 
currently unavailable.’’ 
Citro, who said he still shops at Amazon 
frequently, said he sent his burned surge pro-
tector back for testing as the company re-
quested, but never heard anything about 
what its investigation found. 
‘‘I do wish this particular product was test-
ed more thoroughly,’’ he said. ‘‘A lot was on 
the line with my son’s bedroom in the next 
room.’’ 
Just like Parra’s phone cord, this specific 
kind of surge protector has not been offi-
cially recalled. 
BEHIND THE SCENES 
Three former Amazon employees said the 
vast majority of AmazonBasics electronics 
are made in Asia. The company’s list of sup-
pliers used for its various private label 
lines—including AmazonBasics—shows that 
only around 10% are in the United States and 
nearly half are located in China. 
The 
retailer 
typically 
brings 
AmazonBasics items to market in two ways, 
explained the former product manager. It ei-
ther goes straight to manufacturers that are 
able to meet its standards and works closely 
with 
them 
to 
create 
items 
for 
the 
AmazonBasics line. Or Amazon finds an ex-
isting product and works with a third-party 
company, which may use an outside manu-
facturer of its own, to brand the item with 
the AmazonBasics name. 
The reviews 
More than 90% of the reviews CNN ana-
lyzed were about ‘‘verified purchases.’’ 
Some 400 reviews posted on the site in-
cluded photos or videos as visual evidence of 
their claims. 
Reviews came from around 70 product 
pages, which sometimes included multiple 
variations of an item (such as USB cords in 
different lengths or colors), which may have 
separate identification numbers. 
Reviews were excluded if a product had 
clearly been used incorrectly—for example, 
those saying non-rechargeable batteries were 
placed in a charger. 
Most reviews did not include people’s full 
names, but CNN did reach more than 30 cus-
tomers, and many provided information such 
as evidence of their purchases, photos, addi-
tional details and correspondence with Ama-
zon. 
She said both methods have been imple-
mented for electronics, but that in this sec-
ond scenario, Amazon typically has less in-
sight into the manufacturing process and is 
less involved in quality and safety testing. 
Amazon disputed this, saying it verifies that 
products meet the same safety standards re-
gardless of the business model. The company 
also said it most frequently works directly 
with manufacturers.

PROD-
UCTS ARE TURNING UP FOR SALE ON AMAZON 
Another former employee who was in-
volved with AmazonBasics in its earlier 
years and asked to remain anonymous be-
cause of a confidentiality agreement, said 
employees on the AmazonBasics team would 
randomly order items to inspect and stay on 
top of reviews to make sure red flags were 
being caught. ‘‘We didn’t have a lot of prob-
lems in my time but were much smaller than 
they are now so it was easy to keep things 
under control,’’ the former employee said. 
Former Amazon manager Rachel Greer, 
who left the company in 2015, said that when 
she worked in compliance at the company, 
she believed AmazonBasics products were 
closely monitored from conception to the 
years following their launch, saying there 
was extensive testing done. She said safety 
issues were rare, but when they occurred, 
they were caught quickly and addressed as 
soon as possible. ‘‘If someone complained on 
a review, we took it very seriously,’’ she 
said. 
This required staying on top of manufac-
turers and making sure corners weren’t cut, 
she and the AmazonBasics product manager 
both said. In the case of USB cords, for ex-
ample, Greer described how she made sure 
there was frequent testing of the cords to en-
sure that manufacturers hadn’t begun to 
swap in thinner wiring which could be more 
likely to cause cords to overheat. 
A customer said this AmazonBasics re-
tractable USB cord began melting only a few 
months after he purchased it. ‘‘Had my wife 
not heard it crackling it could have started 
a fire,’’ he wrote in a review. 
‘‘When you’re in charge of compliance for 
something that has the Amazon brand on it, 
I didn’t think it should be something we’re 
messing around with,’’ Greer said. ‘‘When 
you’re outsourcing production there’s a lot 
of things that can go wrong.’’ 
When she left Amazon, she said she was 
growing concerned that a drive to increase 
sales would overshadow a focus on safety as 
the number of AmazonBasics offerings con-
tinued to rise. Prior to her departure, she 
would increasingly disagree with product 
managers, who she said pushed to get items 
into the pipeline faster and more cheaply. 
Performance evaluations reviewed by report-
ers backed up the idea that Greer had 
clashed with colleagues but also described 
her as ‘‘an evangelist for product safety,’’ 
saying ‘‘she is passionate about keeping cus-
tomers safe.’’ 
Greer now works as a consultant to third- 
party sellers, and said she wasn’t surprised 
to hear that customers were complaining of 
alleged dangers. She said that when she 
worked for Amazon, she was never aware of 
anything close to the number or level of seri-
ousness of the reviews identified by CNN, 
and questioned whether testing was still as 
rigorous as it had been in the past. 
‘‘If this had happened on a seller product, 
the second complaint of fire it would have 
been taken down,’’ she said, while scanning 
through some of the more than 150 reviews 
about serious problems with a voice-acti-
vated AmazonBasics microwave—the same 
product tested by CALCE. 
Greer said that if she was still at the com-
pany and had seen so many reports of fire 
about a single item, she likely would have 
reported the microwave to the CPSC and 
worked with the business teams to enact a 
voluntary recall by the company. 
Since the microwave’s release in the fall of 
2018, its product page has been flooded with 
reports from consumers about problems in-
cluding flames, smoke and sparks. These 
kinds of reviews made up roughly 5% of the 
AmazonBasics microwave’s more than 3,000 
reviews as of February, when CNN’s final 
analysis was conducted. Another roughly 
1,000 reviews have been posted since then, 
with fires being reported as recently as Sep-
tember. A microwave that has been reviewed 
less frequently but is the same size and watt-
age had only 10 reviews describing similar 
safety issues—amounting to around .7% of 
its roughly 1,350 reviews on Amazon. 
Research scientists use x-ray CT scanning 
to test AmazonBasics retractable charging 
cords and microwave parts. 
While the retailer did not provide unit 
sales, Amazon said that as the best-selling 
microwave on the site, it may have a higher 
number of sales and reviews, which could re-
sult in more mentioning possible concerns. 
The company disputed Greer’s comments, 
saying safety testing had not become any 
less rigorous and that it was not aware of 
any manufacturers using thinner cables 
‘‘than they were directed to use.’’ It said 
safety testing is handled by reputable third- 
party labs with global facilities, including in 
China and that her statements about the 
microwave were speculative since she was 
not part of the team that worked on this 
item and was not involved in the testing of 
the device. Amazon also said it proactively 
sends safety-related customer reports to the 
CPSC and noted the agency has not issued 
any 
consumer 
warnings 
about 
the 
AmazonBasics microwave. 
STILL FOR SALE 
Amazon declined to provide details about 
why certain products were investigated and 
removed from its site, while others with re-
peated complaints about the same hazards 
are still available to purchase today. 
Leeona Smail said her AmazonBasics bat-
tery charger began to melt and smoke. 
New mom Leeona Smail posted her review 
about an AmazonBasics battery charger late 
last year. When CNN reached her, she re-
counted how she and her husband were 
forced to evacuate their home in the middle 
of the night when they detected the unmis-
takable smell of something burning. They 
gathered their dogs, cats and 4-month-old 
baby by their front porch, called 911 and 
waited for help to arrive. 
It wasn’t until after the firefighters left 
that the Smails said they found what they 
believed was the culprit: an AmazonBasics 
battery charger. They had used the device 
for several years to charge batteries. But 
this time, Smail said, after unplugging it 
from the wall and placing it in a box on their 
coffee table, it began to melt and smoke. 
When the fire chief returned the next day to 
check on them, she said, he was amazed to 
see the source of the smell. 
A Vandergrift, Pennsylvania fire chief con-
firmed that his team was dispatched to in-
vestigate ‘‘a smoke odor and light haze’’ at 
the Smail home. He said they ultimately 
learned that a battery charger ‘‘overheated 
and melted,’’ and said it was unclear whether 
it would have caused the house to catch fire 
if it hadn’t been found. 
Other reviews about the same battery 
charger have described similar concerns. It 
is still available for sale. 
Smail posted a photo of the burned device 
along with her review before throwing it 
away. Amazon eventually gave her a re-
fund—though she said she only received a 
partial one because the warranty window 
had passed. 
Credits 
At least 21 other reviews about the same 
battery charger, which had around 2,000 total 
reviews at the time of CNN’s analysis, also 
said the device had overheated, melted or 
burned. Three described the same situation 
that Smail reported: the charger had not 
even been plugged in and had no batteries in 
it at the time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4988 
September 29, 2020 
The item was still for sale on Amazon at 
the time of publication. 
The company said an investigation con-
firmed the product was safe, and that there 
were no broader design or safety concerns. 
But when asked whether it tested any of the 
actual chargers customers had flagged, and if 
so, what those tests had found, Amazon said 
it did not have ‘‘information to share.’’ 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. In July, I intro-
duced the INFORM Consumers Act 
with Congresswoman KATHY
CASTOR, 
which would require platforms such as 
Amazon to verify third-party sellers. It 
is my sincere hope that this body can 
move, first, on the legislation that we 
are addressing today and, finally, on 
legislation that would protect con-
sumers in a deeper way. 
I thank Representative DUNCAN, my 
friend and colleague, for introducing 
this legislation with me, this impor-
tant consumer safety legislation. I 
would also like to take a moment to 
recognize both majority and minority 
committee staff who worked hard on 
this and each of the other bills that are 
before us today that moved through 
the subcommittee that I have the 
privilege of chairing: Lisa Goldman, 
Anna Yu, Daniel Greene, Chloe Rodri-
guez, Alex Hoehn-Saric, Tim Kurth, 
and Bijan Koohmaraie. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important legislation. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN), the former 
chairman of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee. I appreciate his 
leadership. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the leaders of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee on both sides of 
the aisle for moving forward with H.R. 
8134, the Consumer Product Safety In-
spection Enhancement Act. 
I especially want to thank Chair-
woman SCHAKOWSKY, who has worked 
so hard on this, and Representative 
JEFF DUNCAN, who has also led on this 
bill. This bill will improve coordina-
tion with U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection, the CBP, to target and pre-
vent consumer products that violate 
American 
laws 
from 
entering 
the 
United States. Importantly, this effort 
prioritizes 
shipments 
from 
China, 
where we know the overwhelming ma-
jority of counterfeit goods originate. 
By prioritizing inspection of ship-
ments from China, H.R. 8134 will help 
the CPSC and the CBP identify trends 
and better position us to prevent goods 
that violate our laws and, by the way, 
hurt our small businesses from enter-
ing our country. 
The COVID–19 pandemic underscored 
the importance of addressing supply 
chain threats. This bill is an important 
step in making that happen. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
would ask my colleagues to support 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8134, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

TITLE III—DIGITAL TOKEN TAXONOMY 
SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Digital Tax-
onomy Act’’. 
SEC. 302. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) it is important that the United States re-
mains a leader in innovation; 
(2) digital tokens and blockchain technology 
are driving innovation and providing consumers 
with increased choice and convenience; 
(3) the use of digital tokens and blockchain 
technology is likely to increase in the future; 
(4) the Federal Trade Commission is respon-
sible for protecting consumers from unfair or de-
ceptive acts or practices, including relating to 
digital tokens; 
(5) the Commission has previously taken ac-
tion against unscrupulous companies and indi-
viduals that committed unfair or deceptive acts 
or practices involving digital tokens; and 
(6) to bolster the Commission’s ability to en-
force against unfair or deceptive acts or prac-
tices involving digital tokens, the Commission 
should ensure staff have appropriate training 
and resources to identify and pursue such cases. 
SEC. 303. REPORTS ON UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE 
ACTS 
OR 
PRACTICES 
IN 
TRANS-
ACTIONS RELATING TO DIGITAL TO-
KENS. 
Not later than one year after the date of en-
actment of this Act and each year thereafter 
until fiscal year 2024, the Federal Trade Com-
mission shall transmit to the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce of the House of Representa-
tives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation of the Senate, and make 
publicly available on its website, a report of— 
(1) any actions taken by the Commission relat-
ing to unfair or deceptive acts or practices in 
transactions relating to digital tokens; 
(2) the Commission’s other efforts to prevent 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices relating to 
digital tokens; and 
(3) any recommendations by the Commission 
for legislation that would improve the ability of 
the Commission and other relevant Federal 
agencies— 
(A) to further protect consumers from unfair 
or deceptive acts or practices in the digital token 
marketplace; and 
(B) to promote competition and promote inno-
vation in the global digital token sector. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 8128. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 8128, and I want to begin by 
thanking 
Representatives 
McNerney 
and Burgess for their leadership on 
H.R. 8128, the Consumer Safety Tech-
nology Act. This bill advanced out of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
earlier this month, on September 9, by 
voice vote. 
The legislation will help modernize 
our consumer protection agencies and 
encourage the use of advanced tech-
nologies, like artificial intelligence 
and blockchain, in support of product 
safety and consumer protection. These 
technologies can help the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission and the 
Federal Trade Commission improve 
their operations and more effectively 
carry out their mission. 
Technological 
advances 
and 
globalization have greatly expanded 
the range of consumer products on the 
market, and as consumers shop online, 
more and more of these products are 
being shipped directly to homes. AI 
could help the CPSC oversee the in-
creasingly complex range of products 
under its jurisdiction by helping iden-
tify new injury trends and emerging 
hazards. 
AI can also help the CPSC monitor 
online marketplaces for the illegal sale 
of recalled products. The persistence of 
recalled products on online third-party 
marketplaces is a particularly per-
nicious problem that puts Americans 
needlessly at risk. 
For example, months after the dan-
gerous Fisher-Price Rock ‘n Play and 
other infant inclined sleepers were re-
called, a Consumer Reports investiga-
tion found that these products were 
still being sold on sites like Facebook 
Marketplace 
and 
Craigslist, 
even 
though they had been linked to dozens 
of infant fatalities. I am hopeful that 
AI can be harnessed here to help eradi-
cate the sale of recalled products in 
these online marketplaces. 
Madam Speaker, the CPSC could also 
use AI to assess the risk of the growing 
number of imported consumer products 
entering our country and being sent di-
rectly to consumers. 
I want to thank Representatives 
SOTO, GUTHRIE, and MATSUI for intro-
ducing the Blockchain Innovation Act, 
which was incorporated into H.R. 8128 
during the full committee’s consider-
ation of the bill. So, too, was the Dig-
ital Taxonomy Act, which was intro-
duced by Representatives DAVIDSON 
and SOTO. 
Together, these bills will help iden-
tify ways blockchain technology can be 
used to further support consumer pro-
tection. It will also make sure that 
scammers and fraudsters don’t get 
ahead of consumers and law enforce-
ment in the realm of blockchain and 
digital tokens. 
Finally, I want to thank Ranking 
Member WALDEN
and subcommittee 
Ranking Member RODGERS for working 
with us to move this bill through the 
Energy and Commerce Committee on a 
bipartisan basis. 
Madam Speaker, I call on my col-
leagues to support the measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 8128, the Consumer Safety 
Technology Act. It combines the AI for 
Consumer Product Safety Act, led by 
Dr. BURGESS and Mr. MCNERNEY, and 
the Blockchain Innovation Act, led by 
Mr. GUTHRIE, Mr. SOTO, and Ms. MAT-
SUI. 
Both of these bills help consumer 
protection agencies utilize emerging 
technologies, 
such 
as 
AI 
and 
blockchain, to better fulfill their mis-
sions. Bringing the Federal Govern-
ment into the 21st century by modern-
izing its technology has been a long- 
term goal of mine. I appreciate the 
leadership of these bills’ sponsors in 
doing just that for the Consumer Prod-
uct Safety Commission and the Federal 
Trade Commission. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
GUTHRIE), who has been a leader on 
blockchain policies. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 8128, the 
AI for Consumer Product Safety Act, a 
bipartisan bill introduced by my col-
leagues on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, Representatives MCNER-
NEY and BURGESS. 
Emerging technologies can be a use-
ful tool to help prevent fraud and to 
protect 
consumers. 
This 
bipartisan 
package of bills will help us learn more 
about AI technology to better protect 
Americans. 
I want to thank Representatives 
MCNERNEY and BURGESS for including 
my legislation, the Blockchain Innova-
tion Act, which I introduced with Rep-
resentative SOTO
and Representative 
MATSUI. 
This legislation will help us harness 
blockchain technology for the better-
ment of our consumers and our econ-
omy. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
AI for Consumer Product Safety Act. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my legislation, 
H.R. 8128, the Consumer Safety Tech-
nology Act. 
H.R. 8128 will encourage the use of 
emerging technologies, specifically ar-
tificial intelligence and blockchain, to 
help keep consumers safe, and it will 
aid our consumer protection agencies 
with carrying out their mission. 
H.R. 8128 incorporates the AI for Con-
sumer Product Safety Act, legislation 
that I authored with Representative 
BURGESS. The provisions direct the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission, 
CPSC, to establish a pilot program for 
the agency to use AI in furtherance of 
the agency’s work to protect con-
sumers from unsafe products. 
For example, CPSC could use AI to 
more quickly and efficiently identify 
consumer product hazards, such as ex-
ploding laptops that have faulty bat-
teries, defective USB chargers, fur-
niture that tips over, and unsafe infant

sleep products. Being able to identify 
these hazards more quickly will enable 
the CPSC to also recall the products 
more quickly and, in turn, save lives. 
We have heard firsthand from the 
CPSC Commissioners when they testi-
fied before the House Energy and Com-
merce Committee that AI can benefit 
the agency’s work in serving the Amer-
ican public. 
I am pleased that just 2 weeks ago, 
the House passed my bill, H.R. 2575, the 
AI in Government Act, which will help 
the Federal Government increase AI 
adoption in a smart and responsible 
way. H.R. 8128 marks another critical 
step in advancing this effort. 
H.R. 
8128 
also 
incorporates 
the 
Blockchain Innovation Act introduced 
by Representatives SOTO, GUTHRIE, and 
MATSUI. These provisions will help en-
sure that we can use the benefits of 
blockchain technology to stop scams 
and fraud. 
Additionally, H.R. 8128 incorporates 
the Digital Taxonomy Act from Rep-
resentatives SOTO and DAVIDSON. These 
provisions 
will 
help 
ensure 
that 
scammers and fraudsters don’t get 
ahead of consumers and law enforce-
ment in the realm of blockchain and 
digital tokens. 
I want to thank Representatives 
BURGESS, SOTO, GUTHRIE, MATSUI, and 
DAVIDSON for their work on H.R. 8128 
and Chairman PALLONE and Ranking 
Member WALDEN for moving this legis-
lation through the committee. 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY), the chairwoman of the 
subcommittee. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I also would like to thank the authors 
of 
this 
legislation, 
Representatives 
MCNERNEY, BURGESS, SOTO, MATSUI, 
and DAVIDSON. 
This legislation would direct the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission 
to establish a pilot program that uses 
artificial intelligence technology to 
protect consumers from unsafe prod-
ucts. 
b 1345 
CPSC would have to use AI tech-
nology to track trends related to inju-
ries from consumer products, monitor 
the sale of recalled products, or iden-
tify products prohibited from being im-
ported into the United States. In car-
rying out the pilot program, the agen-
cy would have to consult with AI ex-
perts, manufacturers, and consumer 
product safety organizations. 
CPSC would have to report to Con-
gress on the extent to which AI tech-
nologies improved the agency’s work 
after the pilot program has ended. This 
is exactly the right approach and a 
good complement to all the consumer 
protection bills that we are moving 
today. 
The measure would also direct the 
Commerce Department to conduct, in 
consultation with the Federal Trade 
Commission, FTC, and other relevant 
agencies a study on the commercializa-
tion and use of blockchain technology 
that was added to this bill. It would di-
rect the FTC to report on deceptive 
practices related to digital tokens and 
provide recommendations to Congress 
on improving Federal protection of 
consumers 
from 
blockchain-related 
fraud. 
Again, I want to thank Chairman 
PALLONE and the sponsors of this legis-
lation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, let 
me just thank my colleagues and urge 
support of this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 8128, the Consumer Safety 
Technology Act. I want to thank Mr. MCNER-
NEY, Mr. BURGESS, Mr. SOTO, and Mr. GUTHRIE 
for their leadership on this effort. 
This bipartisan bill directs the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission to conduct a pilot 
program to determine how artificial intelligence 
may be used to advance the agency’s mis-
sion. Given the agency’s broad jurisdiction 
over so many different consumer products, 
being able to efficiently and accurately analyze 
data is critical. 
This bill also includes an important study on 
how blockchain technology may be used to 
address fraud and other unfair and deceptive 
acts and practices. This is complimentary to 
the 
American 
COMPETE 
Act 
that 
also 
prioritizes this emerging technology. 
Blockchain technology would help bolster 
our supply chains, improve privacy—especially 
relating to contact tracing during the COVID– 
19 pandemic, and combat the spread of misin-
formation and fraud. I am glad to see this pro-
vision included in the legislation. 
Relatedly, H.R. 8128 also focuses on digital 
tokens and targets ways in which we can pro-
tect consumers from fraud in the digital token 
marketplace. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8128, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to direct the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission to 
establish a pilot program to explore 
the use of artificial intelligence in sup-
port of the mission of the Commission 
and direct the Secretary of Commerce 
and the Federal Trade Commission to 
study 
and 
report 
on 
the 
use 
of 
blockchain technology and digital to-
kens, respectively.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 8132. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in 
support of H.R. 8132. 
This bipartisan legislation was intro-
duced by the ranking member of the 
Consumer Protection and Commerce 
Subcommittee, CATHY
RODGERS, and 
Representative BOBBY RUSH. I thank 
them for drafting this measure to help 
the U.S. thrive and stay competitive in 
this global economy. It advanced out of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
on September 9 by a voice vote. 
This bill calls on relevant Federal 
agencies to examine the state of var-
ious industries in the U.S., helping pro-
tect America’s leadership with respect 
to emerging technology. For small 
business, this legislation will help 
them take advantage of different kinds 
of emerging technologies, like quan-
tum computing and 3D printing. 
The bill will also protect Americans, 
ensuring that we have a full under-
standing of the effect unmanned deliv-
ery services will have on road safety, 
traffic congestion, and labor, including 
how any negative effects can be miti-
gated. 
I am also pleased that this bill re-
quires the Federal Trade Commission 
to examine how artificial intelligence 
can be used to combat online harms. 
With disinformation proliferating on 
the internet and foreign meddling in 
our elections picking up once again, we 
need to be using all the tools at our 
disposal to put a stop to wrongful on-
line abuses that endanger Americans 
and undermine our democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I call on my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.

Washington, DC, September 25, 2020. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: I am writing to 
you concerning H.R. 8132, the ‘‘American 
Competitiveness 
of 
a 
More 
Productive 
Emerging Tech Economy Act’’ or the ‘‘Amer-
ican COMPETE Act.’’ This legislation in-
volves various aspects of technology develop-
ment. However, in an effort to expedite con-
sideration of this measure, I agree to not 
seek a sequential referral so that the bill 
may be considered expeditiously. 
I take this action with our mutual under-
standing that by foregoing consideration of 
H.R. 8132 at this time, we do not waive any 
jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this or similar legislation. I ask to 
be appropriately consulted and involved as 
the bill or similar legislation moves forward 
so that we may address any remaining issues 
that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding 
and ask that a copy of our exchange of let-
ters on this matter be included in the bill re-
port filed by the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, as well as inserted in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration, 
to memorialize our understanding. 
Sincerely, 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

Washington, DC, September 28, 2020. 
Hon. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN JOHNSON: I am writing 
concerning H.R. 8132, the ‘‘American Com-
pete Act,’’ which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce on August 
28, 2020. 
I appreciate you not seeking a sequential 
referral of H.R. 8132 so that the bill may be 
considered expeditiously. I acknowledge that 
forgoing your referral claim does not waive, 
reduce, or otherwise affect the jurisdiction of 
the Committee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology over this legislation, or any similar 
legislation. I will appropriately consult and 
involve the Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology as this bill progresses. 
I will ensure our letters on H.R. 8132 are in-
cluded in the bill report filed by the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce and entered 
into the Congressional Record during floor 
consideration of the bill. I appreciate your 
cooperation regarding this legislation and 
look forward to continuing to work together 
as this measure moves through the legisla-
tive process. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, Jr., 
Chairman. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 8132, the American Com-
petitiveness Of a More Productive 
Emerging Tech Economy Act, or Amer-
ican COMPETE Act. This package is 
the result of months of hard work by 
the members of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee’s Consumer Protec-
tion and Commerce Subcommittee. 
In May, we unveiled a package of 15 
Republican bills for America to win the 
future in emerging technologies. In 4 
months, we built bipartisan support 
with the majority on nine priorities 
drawn from those bills, and those pro-
posals are incorporated within H.R. 
8132. 
Since the beginning of this Congress, 
Republicans on our subcommittee have 
focused on America’s competitive edge 
and beating China in emerging tech-
nologies, such as AI, quantum com-
puting, blockchain, IoT, and autono-
mous vehicles, among others. 
I appreciate the willingness of Chair-
man PALLONE and Chairwoman SCHA-
KOWSKY for working with us on this 
package and ensuring policymakers 
have the information and tools nec-
essary to craft future legislation that 
will unleash American innovation and 
drive economic success. 
Madam Speaker, I would especially 
like to thank Mr. RUSH, Ms. KELLY, 
and Mr. SOTO
for introducing the 
American COMPETE Act to make it bi-
partisan. A big thank you also to Tim 
Kurth and BJ Koohmaraie from the 
Energy and Commerce Committee mi-
nority staff, and Michael Taggart from 
my personal office, as well as Alex 
Hoehn-Saric, and Lisa Goldman from 
the majority staff for all their hard 
work in preparing these bills for pas-
sage. It is important to note that this 
passed our committee with unanimous 
support. 
Finally, I would like to thank our 
Republican leader, GREG WALDEN, for 
his leadership on these issues and his 
years of leadership on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. He has led for 
years in shaping American policy on 
tech 
and 
telecommunications 
that 
have helped us lead the world. He will 
be sorely missed next year.

light bulb to nuclear energy, the 
United States has led the world in in-
novations that have raised the stand-
ard of living and improved the lives of 
billions of people. 
Today, the stakes for our global lead-
ership could not be higher. To lead a 
new era of innovation, the American 
COMPETE Act is an important first 
step that incentivizes free-market in-
genuity by reducing barriers for the de-
ployment of tech-like artificial intel-
ligence, 
quantum 
computing, 
and 
blockchain. Because who would you 
rather lead in these emerging tech-
nologies, America or China? 
One of the proposals incorporated is 
drawn from the Generating Artificial 
Intelligence Networking Security Act, 
or GAINS Act, which I introduced. It 
would direct the Department of Com-
merce to look at adoption barriers and 
spur deployment of AI here in America. 
It also includes an assessment of vul-
nerabilities in AI supply chain and rec-
ommendations to address identified 
risks, especially from China. Remem-
ber, the Chinese Communist Party is 
using this technology today to sup-
press minorities, track its own citi-
zens, expand its surveillance state, and 
empower other authoritarian regimes. 
Unlike the CCP that uses this tech-
nology for evil, we can use this tech-
nology as a force for good and save peo-
ple’s lives by upholding our American 
values 
for 
human 
dignity, 
human 
rights, and freedom. 
We can win the future in artificial in-
telligence. AI technology and deep- 
learning algorithms can detect brain 
cancers earlier. Clinical trials are al-
ready 
underway, 
making 
break-
throughs 
to 
diagnose 
cancers. 
Of 
course, it has been a critical asset that 
it has helped our top researchers and 
scientists speed up the development of 
coronavirus treatments. 
All of that and more is possible if 
America unleashes the power of our 
innovators to lead. 
For an American competitive agenda, 
this package also includes proposals 
authored by my colleagues. These in-
clude provisions from Dr. BURGESS to 
ensure that we lead in 3D printing de-
velopment, Dr. BUCSHON to lead on the 
Advancing New and Advanced Mate-
rials Act, Mr. HUDSON to boost deploy-
ment in connected manufacturing, and 
Mr. GRIFFITH to ensure that we lead in 
quantum. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank, again, all the Members and staff 
who worked so hard to put this pack-
age together. I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with my colleagues on 
E&C on both sides of the aisle to make 
sure America wins the future and en-
courages the world to follow our lead-
ership, too. These are not Republican 
or Democrat solutions; they are Amer-
ican. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
the American COMPETE Act, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY), the chairwoman of the 
subcommittee. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Chairman PALLONE and Rank-
ing Member WALDEN for your leader-
ship, and of course, to the leadership of 
my ranking member on the Sub-
committee of Consumer Protection and 
Commerce, Representative RODGERS, 
for her innovative work on the Amer-
ican COMPETE Act. I am so proud to 
support that, and I urge all of my col-
leagues, 
along 
with 
Representative 
RODGERS
and, from the Democratic 
side, Mr. RUSH, as a cosponsor of that 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I think all of us 
would agree with the importance, and I 
love the phrase about winning the fu-
ture. I think this legislation does lay a 
kind of blueprint of the direction that 
we can go in and the kinds of tech-
nologies that are really at hand if we 
put our energy and our minds to mak-
ing it happen. I thank you very much. 
Madam Speaker, I also just want to 
take this opportunity to say a special 
thank you at this moment and recog-
nize the service of the ranking member 
of the full committee, Mr. WALDEN. 
There are so many things that you 
can now attribute your service to, the 
legislation that has passed, but I think 
even more than that, I just wanted to 
thank you for the kind of tone that you 
have set, both as the chairman and as 
the ranking member of the committee. 
I think we can be so proud of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. We 
have passed so many bills. We really 
are a legislative powerhouse. But we 
have also done it with the kind of in-
tegrity that I think shines so well on 
the Congress of the United States. 
I just want to acknowledge what a 
great colleague he has been. I consider 
him a friend, and I wish him absolutely 
the best of luck. He will definitely be 
missed. I thank him so much. 
Madam Speaker, I would also like to 
recognize Consumer Protection and 
Commerce 
Subcommittee 
Ranking 
Member RODGERS for the part that she 
has played and the partnership that I 
believe we have had. Of course, we have 
sometimes wanted to move at a dif-
ferent pace or had different ideas, but 
again, I just want to thank the gentle-
woman for the tone that she helped set 
at our hearings and in our efforts to 
pass legislation. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
Ranking Member RODGERS on her hard 
work to move this bill, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1400 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN), our leader 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, the former chairman. Madam 
Speaker, I thank him for his leader-
ship. 
As the subcommittee chairman, JAN 
SCHAKOWSKY, was just speaking, I was 
reminded and appreciated her words, 
and Mr. WALDEN has always led with 
integrity and forward thinking for our 
country. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle, and I especially thank Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY, whom I have had the 
great privilege to serve with for many 
years. There is no more fierce warrior 
for consumers and consumer protection 
than the gentlewoman from Illinois. It 
has been a delight to serve with the 
gentlewoman and work with the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Illinois 
on 
many 
causes. 
And while we haven’t always agreed, 
we have always tried to be agreeable 
with each other. I think that, Madam 
Speaker, is what is often missed out-
side of this institution is that we come 
here representing different people, dif-
ferent philosophies, and then we also 
come here with a common goal: to 
solve problems. We have different ap-
proaches to that from time to time, 
but we generally come together and 
move a lot of good legislation, espe-
cially in the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
I think I can brag on that committee, 
having been a member of it for 20 
years, rose to not only chair a sub-
committee, but chair the full com-
mittee; and now, as I kiddingly say, I 
am chairman in exile, in permanent 
exile. But it has been a great run, and 
I am not one of those Members who is 
cranky or grumpy about leaving either. 
It is a fine institution. 
Democracy was built to be messy and 
loud, and some days it is a little louder 
and messier than any of us would like, 
but we do come together, as we are on 
this legislation and on other things. I 
thank the gentlewoman for her very 
kind comments. 
I rise today in support of this legisla-
tion, H.R. 8132, the COMPETE Act. I 
thank Ms. SCHAKOWSKY and Mrs. ROD-
GERS for their hard work. The gentle-
women have worked really well to-
gether on these and many other issues. 
I asked committee members earlier 
in the year to prioritize our leadership 
on emerging technologies, and the im-
portance of that was emphasized by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. We cannot let 
other countries, especially China or 
any other adversary, advance past us 
on emerging technologies while our 
economy recovers. 
I applaud the leadership on artificial 
intelligence and our committee’s com-
mitment to ensuring America leads the 
world in emerging technologies. 
For America to lead, we need to be 
laser-focused on critical technologies 
that will define our future, and that is 
what this bill does. The American 
COMPETE Act will help us unleash 
American innovation and free-market 
ingenuity 
in 
artificial 
intelligence, 
quantum computing, autonomous tech, 
and other emerging technologies.

September 29, 2020 
The American COMPETE Act also 
aims to help us secure our supply 
chains and develop national strategies 
to advance our private-sector indus-
tries. 
By the way, that means good Amer-
ican, high-paying jobs. 
These technologies will drive infor-
mation breakthroughs, save lives, spur 
economic growth, and will do so for 
generations to come. I am proud to see 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
so focused on these issues. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to vote in support of this 
bill. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
GUTHRIE), 
who 
is 
a 
leader 
on 
blockchain in Congress and led on the 
Advancing Blockchain Act and the 
Counterfeiting Online Harms Act. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 8132, the 
American COMPETE Act. 
This bipartisan package includes two 
of my bills, the Advancing Blockchain 
Act, which would continue our impor-
tant work in blockchain, and the Coun-
tering Online Harms Act, to protect 
Americans from misinformation and 
dangerous content. 
Along with my legislation, the COM-
PETE Act includes several bipartisan 
bills from my Energy and Commerce 
Committee colleagues, all aimed at 
maintaining American dominance in 
emerging 
technology. 
The 
United 
States has always been a leader in 
technology, and we need to keep it that 
way. 
I thank Representative MCMORRIS 
RODGERS and Representative RUSH for 
their leadership on this important 
issue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan 
package. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I say a final word of 
appreciation to the chairman of the 
committee, FRANK PALLONE, and the 
subcommittee chairwoman, JAN SCHA-
KOWSKY, for working together to bring 
us to this place where we could pass 
this package of bills with bipartisan 
support today to make sure that Amer-
ica continues to win the future. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
guess I should say that, I don’t know, 
maybe because I don’t want Mr. WAL-
DEN to retire or maybe because it is 
only September, I am not ready to say 
good-bye yet, so even though some 
wonderful comments have been made 
by Ms. SCHAKOWSKY, I am going wait a 
while. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, H.R. 8132, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4997 
September 29, 2020 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4764. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the C.W. Bill Young 
Transplantation Program was first es-
tablished through a partnership with 
the Navy in 1986, transferred to the Na-
tional Institutes of Health for over-
sight in 1987, and then authorized by 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
in 1990. The program has since been re-
authorized four times, and every time 
it has been accomplished with strong 
bipartisan support. 
I believe that bipartisan support will 
continue today with H.R. 4764, the 
TRANSPLANT Act of 2019, which will 
reauthorize the C.W. Bill Young Trans-
plantation Program for the fifth time. 
Year after year, this program pro-
vides lifesaving bone marrow and um-
bilical cord blood transplants to help 
patients suffering from over 70 dis-
eases. The program assists transplant 
patients by providing additional infor-
mation about bone marrow and cord 
blood transplants, maintaining an effi-
cient process for identifying donor 
matches, increasing the number of un-
related donors available for transplant, 
and collecting data and expanding re-
search to improve patient outcomes. 
I thank my committee colleagues, 
Representatives MATSUI and BILIRAKIS, 
for their leadership on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today, also, in 
support of H.R. 4764, the Timely Reau-
thorization 
of 
Necessary 
Stem-Cell 
Programs Lends Access to Needed 
Therapies Act, or the TRANSPLANT 
Act. 
This critical bill, led by Representa-
tives MATSUI, BILIRAKIS, and PINGREE, 
reauthorizes 
the 
C.W. 
Bill 
Young 
Transplantation Program, which pro-
vides lifesaving bone marrow and um-
bilical blood transplants to patients 
suffering from over 70 diseases that can 
be treated with blood or immune sys-
tem reconstruction using bone marrow, 
peripheral blood, or cord blood. These 
diseases include leukemia, lymphoma, 
sickle cell anemia, and certain other 
immune system disorders. 
I thank our colleagues, Representa-
tives MATSUI, BILIRAKIS, and PINGREE, 
for being tireless advocates for this 
program. They truly have just never 
stopped working to get this done. 
I also express my appreciation to 
Representative CHRIS SMITH from New 
Jersey, who played a critical role in 
the creation of this program, spear-
headed previous reauthorizations, and 
has been a longtime champion for pa-
tients whose only chance at life is a 
transplant through this program. Rep-
resentative SMITH wanted to be here 
today to express his strong support for 
this bipartisan initiative, but, unfortu-
nately, he could not be present because 
of a death in his own family. 
All of this is to say that I am incred-
ibly grateful for all of the bipartisan 
efforts from multiple Members of Con-
gress who have prioritized this pro-
gram and worked together to get this 
bill across the finish line. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I have a statement from Congress-
man CHRIS SMITH of New Jersey that I 
will include in the RECORD in support 
of this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS), who is 
one of the real advocates of this legis-
lation. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 4764, the 
Timely Reauthorization of Necessary 
Stem-Cell Programs Lends Access to 
Needed Therapies, or the TRANS-
PLANT, Act. 
As co-chair of the Blood Cancers Cau-
cus, I urge my colleagues to support 
the TRANSPLANT Act. This bill is 
about providing hope to those who are 
struggling with life-threatening ill-
nesses. 
The TRANSPLANT Act reauthorizes 
the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplan-
tation Program in addition to the Na-
tional Cord Blood Inventory. I know 
that this was a priority for Congress-
man YOUNG, and it was an honor to 
serve with him and help him pass this 
bill initially. 
This Federal program provides crit-
ical support in the advancement of re-
search for better treatments and the 
infrastructure necessary to organize 
registries which help ensure transplant 
patients have access to lifesaving pro-
cedures. Simply put, its continued re-
authorization is vital for patients with 
diseases like blood disorders, blood 
cancer, sickle cell anemia, and inher-
ited metabolic or immune system dis-
orders. 
I sincerely appreciate the work of my 
friend and colleague and fellow Blood 
Cancers Caucus co-chair, Congress-
woman MATSUI, in addition to the leg-
acy of bipartisan leadership and sup-
port of these programs by Members 
like Congressman CHRIS SMITH and, of 
course, our good chairman and ranking 
member. 
Additionally, I appreciate the crit-
ical daily work of the National Marrow 
Donor Program, operating the Be the 
Match national registry, connecting 
patients in search of a cure with life-
saving bone marrow donors, even in the 
midst of this historic pandemic. 
I also would like to take a moment 
to recognize the great work of Dr. Jo-
anne Kurtzberg, the president of the 
Cord Blood Association. She also serves 
in multiple roles at Duke University, 
including director of the Carolinas 
Cord Blood Bank. 
Dr. Kurtzberg has dedicated her pro-
fessional career to cord blood research, 
banking, and transplantation, and is an 
internationally recognized umbilical 
cord blood transplanter. She advised 
Congress on the creation of the public 
cord blood banking program, which was 
part of the Stem Cell Therapeutic and 
Research Act of 2005, and I believe that 
was led by Representative CHRIS SMITH. 
Dr. Kurtzberg continues to be a trusted 
adviser to Congress on this important 
program. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to join 
us in expediting the passage of this 
lifesaving bipartisan bill, and it is a 
very crucial bill for a lot of people, 
Madam Speaker. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I en-
courage my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
also ask for bipartisan support for this 
legislation. I mention that I do intend 
to seek a recorded vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
Margaret Hahn—my mother-in-law—passed 
away on Friday and a Mass of Christian burial 
will be held today at St. Mary Church in South 
Amboy, New Jersey. She was 96 and was 
deeply loved and will be deeply missed. 
Margaret—Peg—was a great woman—wife, 
mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. 
She selflessly devoted her life to public serv-
ice including her amazing work as Sayreville 
Borough Clerk for twenty years. She had an 
incredible reputation for getting things done for 
the people. No matter who served as mayor or 
on Council, everyone knew she was the 
power. 
My wife Marie and I will join family and 
friends today at her funeral and internment 
making it impossible for me to speak today 
during the debate on the reauthorization of a 
law I originally authored fifteen years ago—the 
Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 
2005—and the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Re-
search Act of 2015. 
So, I submit these comments for the 
RECORD: 
Madam Speaker, today the House of Rep-
resentatives will vote to reauthorize the Stem 
Cell Therapeutic and Research Act. 
This was an original idea of mine 20 years 
ago. Joined by 70 cosponsors, I introduced it 
in 2001 and again in 2003. 
After five long years of hard work and nu-
merous setbacks, my bill was finally enacted 
into law in 2005. 
Beginning in 2001, Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, 
who is President of the Cord Blood Associa-
tion, helped draft my original law. Dr. 
Kurtzberg has said, ‘‘Cord blood transplan-
tation is now an established field with enor-
mous potential. In the future, it may emerge

as a source of cells for cellular therapies fo-
cused on tissue repair and regeneration.’’ 
The new law created a nationwide umbilical 
cord blood stem cell program, designed to col-
lect, derive, type, and freeze cord blood units 
for transplantation into patients to mitigate and 
to even cure serious disease. Pursuant to the 
law, it also provided stem cells for research. 
The new cord blood program was combined in 
our 2005 law with an expanded bone marrow 
initiative, which was crafted over several years 
by our distinguished colleague, Congressman 
Bill Young. 
I was the prime sponsor again when it was 
reauthorized in 2015. 
Umbilical cord blood stem cells, obtained 
after the birth of a child, have proved highly 
efficacious in treating 70 diseases, including 
sickle-cell disease, lymphoma, and leukemia. 
And scientists are continuing to study and bet-
ter understand the regenerative effects of cord 
blood cell therapies for other diseases and 
conditions. Bone marrow donations provide 
lifesaving transplants to treat diseases like 
blood cancer, sickle cell anemia, or inherited 
metabolic or immune system disorders. 
The National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI) 
provides funding to public cord blood banks 
participating in the program to allow them to 
expand the national inventory of cord blood 
units available for transplant. These units are 
then listed on the registry by the ‘‘Be the 
Match’’ Program. The funds appropriated thus 
far have led to an important increase in the 
overall number of high-quality cord blood units 
available through the national registry, includ-
ing 150,000 NCBI units. Within the Be the 
Match registry, there are more than 783,000 
NCBI units worldwide. 
The Program registry allows patients and 
physicians to locate matching cord blood units, 
as well as adult donors for marrow and periph-
eral blood stem cells, when a family donor is 
not available. The Program is the world’s larg-
est, most diverse donor registry, with more 
than 22 million volunteers and more than 
300,000 public cord blood units. To date, the 
National Marrow Donor Program/Be The 
Match (NMDP), through its operation of the 
Program, has facilitated more than 100,000 
transplants. More than 45,000 patients have 
received cord blood transplants, according to 
Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg. 
The reauthorization before us authorizes 
$23 million to be appropriated for fiscal year 
2021 through fiscal year 2025. It also author-
izes $30 million to be appropriated for fiscal 
years 2021 through 2025 for the bone marrow 
transplant program. This continues funding at 
the same levels authorized in the 2015 author-
ization bill. 
Madam Speaker, each year nearly 4 million 
babies are born in America. In the past, vir-
tually every placenta and umbilical cord was 
tossed as medical waste. Today, doctors have 
turned this medical waste into medical mir-
acles. 
Not only has God in His wisdom and good-
ness created a placenta and umbilical cord to 
nurture and protect the precious life of an un-
born child, but now we know that another gift 
awaits us immediately after birth. Something 
very special is left behind—cord blood that is 
teeming with lifesaving stem cells. Indeed, it 
remains one of the best kept secrets in Amer-
ica that umbilical cord blood stem cells and 
adult stem cells in general are curing people 
of a myriad of terrible conditions and dis-
eases—over 70 diseases in adults as well as 
in children. 
The legislation that is before us will enable 
even more patients to receive the treatments 
that they so desperately need.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 5373. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 5373, 
the United States Anti-Doping Agency 
Reauthorization Act of 2020. 
For two decades, Madam Speaker, 
the United States Anti-Doping Agency, 
or USADA, has worked to ensure integ-
rity in our American Olympic and 
Paralympic sporting activities. 
In the 1990s, countries around the 
world viewed American athletes as 
dirty and only winning because they 
were doping. 
In an effort to bring credibility back 
to the United States, an Olympic com-
mittee task force recommended that an 
independent organization be created to 
conduct a comprehensive antidoping 
program. In 2000, Congress acted on 
this recommendation and gave USADA 
the authority to manage this com-
prehensive antidoping program. 
Since then, USADA has performed 
hundreds of thousands of tests and con-
tributed to the advancement of clean 
sports 
through 
scientific 
research, 
antidoping education, and outreach 
programs. 
In order to enable USADA to con-
tinue this work, H.R. 5373 would extend 
and increase the authorization level 
and empower the organization to en-
courage a positive sporting environ-
ment for youth by way of promoting 
educational materials on sportsman-
ship, character building, and healthy 
performance. By advancing this bill, we 
will send a strong message to young 
athletes about the importance of integ-
rity, respect, and responsibility in 
sports. 
The bill also improves antidoping ef-
forts in the U.S. by encouraging Fed-
eral agencies to coordinate and share

information with the USADA to pre-
vent the use of performance-enhancing 
drugs and methods. 
Taken together, these actions will 
make positive improvements to the 
good work USADA is already doing. 
And passage takes on additional impor-
tance as USADA gears up for the 2028 
Summer 
Olympic 
and 
Paralympic 
Games in Los Angeles. 
Before I conclude, Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleagues, Representatives 
MIKE
THOMPSON, BILL
JOHNSON, and 
DIANA DEGETTE, for leading this impor-
tant legislation. I also thank our 
Ranking Member WALDEN and all the 
members and staff of our committees 
for their efforts to move this legisla-
tion forward in a bipartisan manner. 
So, Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today to speak in support of 
H.R. 5373, as did the chairman, the 
United States Anti-Doping Agency Re-
authorization Act, sponsored by Rep-
resentatives 
MIKE
THOMPSON, 
BILL 
JOHNSON, and DIANA DEGETTE. 
This bill reauthorizes the U.S. Anti- 
Doping Agency, which is the national 
entity 
charged 
with 
administering 
antidoping programs for the United 
States for Olympic, Paralympic, Pan 
American, 
and 
Parapan 
American 
sports. 
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency han-
dles in-competition and out-of-com-
petition testing, results management 
processes, drug reference resources, 
and athlete education for all of our 
United States Olympic and Paralympic 
Committee-recognized sports’ national 
governing bodies, their athletes, and 
their events. USADA is also the admin-
istrator for the Ultimate Fighting 
Championship Anti-Doping Program. 
Reauthorizing this important agency 
furthers the advancement of clean 
sports, fair games, and positive sports-
manship, so I urge support of the legis-
lation. 
I don’t believe I have any speakers on 
my side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, 
so I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge support for the legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
5373, my bipartisan legislation reauthorizing 
the United States Anti-Doping Agency. 
As you know, USADA is recognized by Con-
gress as the official antidoping agency for 
Olympic, Paralympic, and other sporting com-
petitions in the United States. Among other re-
sponsibilities, USADA conducts drug testing 
for athletes, manages test results, and pur-
sues bad actors who seek to undermine the 
principles of clean and fair sport through the 
use of illicit or banned substances. 
Current funding for USADA expires this 
year. My legislation, authored with Represent-
atives JOHNSON (R–OH) and DEGETTE (D– 
CO), would reauthorize USADA through Fiscal 
Year 2027. The bill also provides a slight fund-
ing boost beginning in 2026, to allow USADA 
to prepare for the 2028 Olympics in Los Ange-
les. 
In addition, this legislation would require 
USADA to devote a portion of its funding to 
clean sport initiatives for young athletes, and 
authorizes the Department of Justice and 
other federal agencies to cooperate with 
USADA in the course of its investigations. 
As recent doping scandals have shown— 
particularly in the world of cycling—the abuse 
of performance enhancing drugs often begins 
at a young age. 
Many young athletes, especially those with 
promising careers, face enormous pressure to 
gain any competitive edge available to them— 
including pressure from coaches, trainers, par-
ents and other adults. It is critical that these 
young competitors have the education and re-
sources they need to surmount that pressure, 
stay clean, and stay healthy. 
I am grateful to my colleagues on the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee for advancing 
this legislation to the Floor, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote Yes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

EARLY ACT REAUTHORIZATION OF 
2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4078) to reauthorize the 
Young Women’s Breast Health Edu-
cation and Awareness Requires Learn-
ing Young Act of 2009, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4078 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘EARLY Act 
Reauthorization of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE YOUNG WOM-
EN’S BREAST HEALTH EDUCATION 
AND AWARENESS REQUIRES LEARN-
ING YOUNG ACT OF 2009. 
Section 399NN(h) of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280m(h)) is amended by 
striking ‘‘$4,900,000 for each of fiscal years 
2015 through 2019’’ and inserting ‘‘$9,000,000 
for each of fiscal years 2021 through 2025’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4078. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, tragically, one in 
eight women in the United States will 
be diagnosed with breast cancer over 
their lifetime. Breast cancer is the 
most common form of cancer in women 
and the second leading cause of cancer 
death in women. From 2013 to 2017, 
breast cancer death rates in older 
women declined. However, breast can-
cer death rates have remained steady 
in younger women. 
We know that breast health edu-
cation, awareness, and screening saves 
lives. 
The bill we are considering today, 
H.R. 4078, the EARLY Act Reauthoriza-
tion, reauthorizes initiatives at the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention 
to 
increase 
knowledge 
of 
breast cancer and risks of breast can-
cer among young women. This bill 
nearly doubles the investment Con-
gress is making in this program, be-
cause we believe it is crucial that we 
stop losing young moms, daughters, 
sisters, and friends, to breast cancer. 
This program is critically important, 
and I want to thank Representatives 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ and BROOKS for 
their bipartisan leadership on this pro-
gram. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4078, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the bill, Young Women’s Breast Health 
Education and Awareness Act, the 
EARLY Act Reauthorization, which 
was 
introduced 
by 
Representatives 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ and BROOKS. This 
bill reauthorizes the EARLY Act of 
2009, which established a national pub-
lic health education campaign to pro-
mote awareness and early detection of 
breast cancer among young women. 
Breast cancer is the leading cause of 
cancer deaths in women under the age 
of 40, and each year almost 24,000 new 
cases are diagnosed. It is critical that 
both young women and healthcare pro-
fessionals are equipped with the knowl-
edge and healthcare services needed for 
early detection and treatment of breast 
cancer. 
Madam Speaker, by reauthorizing 
the EARLY Act, H.R. 4078 would en-
hance early detection of breast cancer, 
increase public awareness of risk fac-
tors and risk reduction strategies, and 
support the provision of psychosocial 
and medical services for young women 
diagnosed with breast cancer. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Mrs. 
BROOKS for all of her work on the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. From 
day one on our committee, we all knew 
she was going to be prepared and ready 
to go to work. Congresswoman BROOKS

has the experience. She was a U.S. At-
torney and has been an invaluable 
member of our committee, and she will 
be retiring and leaving Congress at the 
end of this term. Her grace, her skill, 
her knowledge, her friendship, her in-
credible work ethic will all be missed 
as this Congress and the next one con-
tinues to navigate complex issues that 
come across our desks. 
So, Madam Speaker, to Congress-
woman BROOKS, I thank her for her 
service. The committee will miss her, 
but she has left an indelible mark in an 
important chapter in American his-
tory. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the sponsor of 
the legislation. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
I rise today to support my bill, the 
Breast Cancer Education and Aware-
ness Requires Learning Young Act Re-
authorization, or the EARLY Act. 
I do want to start by thanking Chair-
man PALLONE
and Ranking Member 
WALDEN, as well as my Republican co- 
lead, Congresswoman SUSAN BROOKS. I 
deeply appreciate their advocacy and 
assistance 
shepherding 
this 
bill 
through the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. I also thank Senators KLO-
BUCHAR and CRAPO for sponsoring the 
Senate version of this important bipar-
tisan reauthorization bill. 
The EARLY Act, which I first intro-
duced in 2009, became law in 2010 as 
part of the Affordable Care Act. 
The inspiration for this bill was born 
from my own battle against breast can-
cer at the age of 41. That was 13 years 
ago. It is hard to believe. 
I was a young woman at high risk, 
but I didn’t know it. I was aware 
enough to know the right questions to 
ask and to understand the steps that 
were necessary in my treatment. 
But many young women, Madam 
Speaker, are not aware that they pos-
sess genetic or other factors that ex-
pose them to higher risk of getting 
breast cancer. And when it strikes 
them, they and even their doctors are 
often unprepared to deal with this ter-
rible diagnosis. 
But knowledge is power, and it can 
also be lifesaving, too. 
The earlier that breast cancer cases 
are identified, the better the chances 
are of survival. That is exactly why, 
after surviving 15 months of surgeries 
and 
treatment, 
I 
introduced 
the 
EARLY Act—in order to fill this major 
gap in our healthcare system. 
We could not then and cannot now af-
ford to be silent about these specific 
risks and how they impact certain 
communities, not when so many lives 
are on the line. 
Breast cancer is a disease that knows 
no boundaries. It strikes women from 
all backgrounds, races and ethnicities, 
the rich and the poor, the old and the 
young. About one in eight women, as 
the ranking member and the chairman 
have said, will get breast cancer in 
their lifetime. 
About 11 percent of all new cases of 
breast cancer in the United States are 
found in women younger than 45 years 
of age. 
Breast cancer is the leading cause of 
cancer deaths in women under 40 and 
breast cancer in younger women tends 
to be more aggressive. 
Each 
year, 
approximately 
70,000 
women age 15 to 39 are diagnosed with 
cancer in the United States. Breast 
cancer is the most common cancer for 
women in this age group. 
Nearly 80 percent of young women di-
agnosed with breast cancer find their 
breast abnormality themselves. 
Additionally, certain ethnic groups, 
including Ashkenazi Jews—my ethnic 
origin—and African-American young 
women have an increased risk of breast 
cancer. Black women are exposed to a 
greater risk because systemic racism 
has limited their access to preventive 
care. 
I am proud that the bill before us 
today not only reauthorizes the pro-
gram, but also increases the authorized 
funding level for breast cancer edu-
cation and awareness programs. 
The bill allows the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention to con-
tinue administering its crucial edu-
cation and outreach campaign that 
highlights breast cancer risks facing 
young women, including campaigns 
specifically for African-American and 
Jewish women. 
The EARLY Act is designed to help 
educate healthcare providers on the 
specific threats and warning signs of 
breast cancer in younger women. This 
education can often lead to early de-
tection, diagnosis, and survival. 
The bill also aids organizations that 
support young women diagnosed with 
breast cancer and, further, helps them 
overcome the unique challenges that 
we face, including dealing with the so-
cial 
and 
psychological 
stress 
that 
comes with a cancer diagnosis for far 
longer in our lifetimes. 
The EARLY Act has already bene-
fited women. Mortality rates from 
breast cancer have dropped in the past 
10 years, in large part due to early de-
tection. 
After 10 years of successful imple-
mentation, it is now time to again re-
authorize the EARLY Act and increase 
funding to ensure we can reach more 
young women and healthcare providers 
across the country. 
At a time when people with pre-
existing conditions across the country 
are at greater risk, prevention and 
awareness can be the difference be-
tween life and death. 
Not knowing can kill you. 
Not being aware of the importance of 
paying attention to your breast health 
can be life ending and life altering. 
As a public servant and a cancer sur-
vivor, it has become my life’s mission 
to help women, especially younger 
women and women at higher risk, like 
I was without knowing it, to better ad-
vocate on behalf of themselves and 
their breast health. 
Madam Speaker, I thank and encour-
age my colleagues to support this ur-
gent and lifesaving legislation. 
b 1430 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers. I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
would just conclude by thanking the 
gentlewoman from Florida for sharing 
her story. I know it has been a rugged 
journey that she has endured on, but 
this legislation will save lives. It is so 
important that we do this work today. 
I had a dear friend who was diagnosed 
at an early age, and they had it pretty 
much under control. Then, after the 
birth of their second child, it came 
back with a vengeance and claimed her 
young life. 
This is a vicious, vicious attack on 
the body. I know we have all joined to-
gether to invest in research, and some-
day, we hope we will overcome this and 
save all lives. 
But in the meantime, reauthorizing 
this important body of work that the 
gentlewoman has led on is critical. So, 
I would encourage our colleagues to 
join us in passing this legislation. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4078, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

HELPING MEDICAID OFFER 
MATERNITY SERVICES ACT OF 2020

move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4996) to amend title XIX of 
the Social Security Act to provide for 
a State option under the Medicaid pro-
gram to provide for and extend contin-
uous coverage for certain individuals,

MOMS Act of 2020. 
The U.S. has some of the world’s

childbirth here in the U.S. than in 
other nations in the developed world. 
Maternal mortality especially affects 
women of color. Black women and 
American Indian and Alaska Native 
women are three times more likely 
than White women to die from preg-
nancy-related causes. Even more trag-
ically, most of these deaths are pre-
ventable. 
These statistics are unacceptable. 
They 
are 
an 
indictment 
of 
our 
healthcare system, Madam Speaker, 
and I believe we can do better. 
Ensuring that women have access to 
health insurance for the first year 
postpartum is an obvious first step 
that we can take to ensure that all 
women, regardless of income, have ac-
cess to the care they need for the crit-
ical first year after giving birth. 
Currently, Medicaid covers pregnant 
women for 60 days postpartum. After 
that, many women lose eligibility and 
go without a consistent source of care. 
The Helping MOMS Act would build on 
this coverage by giving States the op-
tion to extend Medicaid coverage to 
women to a full year postpartum. 
This bill is endorsed by the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gyne-
cologists, the Association of Maternal 
and Child Health Programs, the Na-
tional Birth Equity Collaborative, the 
March of Dimes, and many more orga-
nizations. 
I want to commend Representative 
ROBIN KELLY for her passion and com-
mitment to this bill and to improving 
the lives of new mothers. 
I also want to thank and recognize 
Representative MICHAEL BURGESS, the 
ranking member of the Health Sub-
committee, for his steadfast leadership 
on the Republican side. 
Finally, I want to recognize the ef-
forts 
of 
Representatives 
LAUREN 
UNDERWOOD, CATHY RODGERS, AYANNA 
PRESSLEY, and BUDDY CARTER for their 
leadership on this issue and their com-
mitment to bipartisan solutions. 
Too many children in this country, 
Madam Speaker, grow up knowing 
their mothers only as a fading picture 
on the wall or as someone whose name 
brings a bittersweet smile and a tear to 
friends and loved ones. It doesn’t have 
to be this way. 
This bill will not singlehandedly fix 
the maternal health crisis in this coun-
try, but it will mean that more of these 
children will have a mother to take 
care of them, tuck them in at night, 
comfort them in moments of need, and 
share in their moments of joy and sor-
row. I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill for these children and their 
mothers. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4996. This is the Helping 
Medicaid Offer Maternity Services, or 
MOMS, Act of 2019. It was introduced 
by Representative KELLY from Illinois 
and Dr. BURGESS from Texas. 
As you have heard, this legislation 
gives States the option to extend the 
length of continuous postpartum eligi-
bility for Medicaid to 12 months. Now, 
this is a critically important bill. De-
spite everything that is going on in the 
country, it is an example of, once 
again, Congress coming together to do 
the right thing for the right reason. 
This bipartisan legislation furthers 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce’s mission to address maternal 
mortality, which we all agree needs 
further attention, and to improve the 
health outcomes in expectant or new 
moms. 
Last 
Congress, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
President Trump signed bipartisan leg-
islation from our committee into law 
to advance maternal health. We are 
now building on that progress today. 
Medicaid is the largest single-payer 
of maternity care in the United States. 
Medicaid covered 43 percent of all 
births in 2017, the latest data we have. 
Now, in some of our States, the share 
of healthcare costs of births financed 
by Medicaid is even higher. As such, 
this program plays a significant role in 
improving maternal health and helping 
to 
eliminate 
preventable 
maternal 
mortality. 
I want to thank Ms. KELLY and Dr. 
BURGESS for leading this effort, and I 
want to thank Chairman PALLONE and 
his staff for working together to find a 
path forward with this important legis-
lation. 
Getting this measure signed into law 
will have a meaningful impact on the 
maternal mortality crisis. We will 
make a difference with this legislation. 
We will save more moms’ lives. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support this legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
KELLY), the sponsor of the bill. 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to encourage my col-
leagues to support the Helping MOMS 
Act. This bipartisan legislation, which 
I authored together with my colleagues 
on the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, would allow States to use 
their own funds to extend Medicaid 
coverage for new moms to the entire 
postpartum period of 1 year, which is 
the recommendation of medical profes-
sionals and experts. Right now, States 
must seek a waiver from the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services to ex-
pand postpartum coverage beyond 60 
days. 
With Medicaid providing coverage for 
more than half of new American moms, 
expanding Medicaid would save lives. 
Study after study has proven this to be 
the case. This bill will help correct a 
hurdle that has existed for too many 
women. 
Tragically, we know that our Na-
tion’s maternal mortality crisis, like 
so many public health challenges, is 
taking a disproportionate toll on Afri-
can-American moms. Black moms die 
at 21⁄2 times the rate of White moms. In 
my home State of Illinois, the dis-
parity grows to six times. It is time for 
us to give new moms that opportunity 
to stay healthy by seeing their doctors. 
On top of removing the waiver re-
quirement, this bill also studies the 
availability of, access to, and success 
of doulas in providing care to moms be-
fore, during, and after birth within the 
Medicaid program. 
For those unfamiliar with the term, 
a doula is a trained companion who, 
while not always a healthcare profes-
sional, supports mothers through the 
pregnancy process. Studies have shown 
that doulas are a powerful and cost-ef-
fective way to improve care delivery 
and prevent maternal death. 
Before closing, I want to thank my 
colleagues from Texas and Washington 
for their leadership and support. Like-
wise, I would like to thank the more 
than dozen organizations that endorsed 
this legislation, including the Amer-
ican College of Obstetricians and Gyne-
cologists. 
While the Helping MOMS Act is a 
compromise and not as comprehensive 
as I had hoped, this is a major step for-
ward that Congress can and should 
take in a bipartisan way to help save 
mothers’ lives. 
In 2020, starting or growing a family 
should never cost a woman her life, so 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ on the Helping MOMS 
Act. It will help ensure healthy and 
happy 
moms, 
babies, 
and 
families 
across America. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
have no other speakers on this meas-
ure. I would encourage its passage. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
would urge support for the bill, and I 
also yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 4996, the Helping MOMS Act of 
2019. I’m proud to have advanced this bipar-
tisan bill through my Health Subcommittee and 
I’m pleased to support it on the Floor today. 
My thanks to Reps. KELLY, BURGESS, 
UNDERWOOD, RODGERS, PRESSLEY, and CAR-
TER for introducing the Helping Medicaid Offer 
Maternity Services Act, a bipartisan bill to 
make it easier for states to expand Medicaid 
or CHIP coverage for one year postpartum. 
While the uninsured rate among postpartum 
women has decreased thanks to the Afford-
able Care Act, many women still lose Med-
icaid coverage two months after having a 
baby. 
In Texas, Georgia, and Oklahoma, 20 per-
cent of new mothers are uninsured. Lack of 
coverage keeps women from receiving needed 
care, including mental health services to de-
tect and treat postpartum depression. 
This bill makes it easier for states to expand 
coverage by removing administrative red tape 
and by offering a small financial incentive to 
states to expand postpartum care. 
I think we should go further and make 
postpartum coverage a mandatory benefit in 
the Medicaid program, but I’m pleased we’re 
taking this step today to make it an easy op-
tion for states. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
this bill.

AWARENESS 
AND 
RESEARCH 
ACT OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3131) to amend the Public 
Health Service Act to provide for re-
search and improvement of cardio-
vascular health among the South Asian 
population of the United States, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3131 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘South Asian 
Heart Health Awareness and Research Act of 
2020’’. 
SEC. 2. HEART HEALTH PROMOTION GRANTS. 
Title III of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by inserting 
after section 317U (42 U.S.C. 247b–23) the fol-
lowing new section: 
‘‘SEC. 317V. HEART HEALTH PROMOTION GRANTS.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 3131. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, heart disease is the 
leading cause of death in the United 
States, and tragically, the risk of heart 
disease death differs dramatically by 
race and ethnicity. 
Overall, racial and ethnic minorities 
have an elevated risk of morbidity and 
mortality due to heart disease. Racial 
and ethnic minorities confront more 
barriers to heart health care than 
White Americans, including higher co-
morbidity rates, less culturally com-
petent care, and fewer proactive heart 
health interventions. 
This bill, the South Asian Heart 
Health Awareness and Research Act of 
2020, directs the Department of Health 
and Human Services to build on cur-
rent heart disease programs to improve 
further heart health awareness, edu-
cation, 
training, 
and 
research 
for 
groups disproportionately affected by 
heart disease. 
In November 2019, the American 
Heart Association and other medical 
groups 
issued 
updated 
cholesterol 
guidelines that, for the first time, 
urged doctors to consider ethnicity 
when determining a patient’s cardio-
vascular risk and treatment options. 
This bill builds upon the work of de-
termined medical partners like the 
American Heart Association to provide 
more resources for States that wish to 
expand their heart health programs. 
This bill would not be on the floor 
today without the determined effort of 
Congresswoman JAYAPAL, and I com-
mend her for her leadership on this. I 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
3131. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk 
about H.R. 3131, the South Asian Heart 
Health Awareness and Research Act of 
2020 sponsored by my friend and col-
league from the Northwest, Represent-
ative JAYAPAL. This bill authorizes ini-
tiatives that will help improve our un-
derstanding of cardiovascular disease 
in South Asians living in the United 
States, a laudable goal. 
b 1445 
The intent of this bill is laudable, as 
South Asians are a population dis-
proportionately impacted by diabetes 
and heart disease. In fact, according to 
the American College of Cardiology, 
South Asians represent approximately 
25 percent of the world’s population, 
yet they account for 60 percent of the 
world’s heart disease patients. 
While I support initiatives to im-
prove health in ethnic and minority 
communities, I do have some concerns 
with the bill itself. 
In providing technical feedback on 
the legislation, the Centers for Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention, 
CDC, 
ex-
pressed concerns that the grants au-
thorized under the legislation would be 
duplicative of their current efforts to 
address cardiovascular disease in dis-
proportionately 
impacted 
commu-
nities. These efforts include the CDC’s 
Division of Nutrition, Physical Activ-
ity and Obesity, in addition to the 
health promotion grants to States and 
the 
WISEWOMAN 
Program, 
which 
stands for Well-Integrated Screening 
and Evaluation for WOMen Across the 
Nation. 
In addition, the CDC expressed con-
cerns that it would not be able to pro-
vide the data that the bill is mandating 
the agency report on. 
Broadly, the agency does have data 
on minority and disproportionately im-
pacted groups with regard to cardio-
vascular disease; that is true. However, 
they do not have enough data on the 
specific subgroup of the South Asian 
population in order to put together a 
complete and meaningful report that 
would be useful for Congress in making 
future policy decisions. While unfortu-
nate, it is because CDC does not yet 
have the data collection technology 
nor the capabilities to obtain that kind 
of granular data. 
Therefore, before mandating such a 
report, Congress should instead pass 
H.R. 5321, the Public Health Infrastruc-
ture Modernization Act, led by Rep-
resentatives CARTER and MCBATH, bi-
partisan legislation which would mod-
ernize CDC’s data infrastructure and

improve the collection of more granu-
lar information on communities dis-
proportionately impacted by cardio-
vascular disease, such as South Asian 
communities. It would be nice if we 
had that bill moving through, because 
that, I think, would provide the ability 
for CDC to get the data that this bill 
before us today requires. 
So I appreciate the gentlewoman 
from Washington for bringing needed 
attention to this issue. I would like to 
thank the majority for working with 
us to get this bill to a better place. 
While we agree with the administra-
tion’s concerns, we also think the bill 
is a good first step in raising awareness 
about this important public health 
issue. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. JAYAPAL), who is the sponsor of 
the bill. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for his leadership 
and the ranking member for his excel-
lent comments. 
I understand the concerns, and I 
would just say that, as the first South 
Asian-American woman ever elected to 
the U.S. House of Representatives, I 
am so proud to see this important bill 
come to the floor, and I want to thank 
my colleague, Representative JOE WIL-
SON, for his help and support of this im-
portant bipartisan bill. 
South Asians are the second fastest 
growing minority group in the United 
States, and yet this group is four times 
more at risk of developing heart dis-
ease than the general population and 
has the highest prevalence of type 2 di-
abetes. 
The research and understanding of 
why we are so prone to heart disease is 
limited, while the devastating impact 
on our families is only increasing. In 
fact, the story of this bill, as much leg-
islation 
happens, 
began 
when 
my 
former deputy chief of staff, Ven 
Neralla, unexpectedly lost his mother 
to heart disease. Wanting to under-
stand why this happened, we found that 
this was not just an isolated incident, 
but an alarming trend that had re-
ceived far too little attention. 
The South Asian Heart Health bill 
will fund the creation of culturally ap-
propriate materials, engagement with 
community groups working to promote 
South Asian heart health, and create 
an information clearinghouse about 
South Asian heart health. The bill also 
funds grants for the CDC and NIH to 
conduct research on the impact of 
heart disease on South Asians in the 
United States. 
The bill has been endorsed by an in-
credible number of medical organiza-
tions, including the American College 
of Cardiology, the American Heart As-
sociation, 
WomenHeart, 
the 
South 
Asian Public Health Association, and 
many, many more. 
COVID–19 has taught us the value of 
preventing underlying health condi-
tions and addressing health inequities 
afflicting communities of color. The 
South Asian Heart Health bill is a sig-
nificant step in raising the alarm, re-
versing the trend of heart disease in 
our communities, and saying to South 
Asian-American 
communities 
across 
the country: We see you here in Con-
gress, and we are ready to help. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers on my side 
of the aisle, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. I urge support of this 
the bill, and I yield back the balance of 
my time, Madam Speaker. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the South Asian Heart 
Health Awareness and Research Act. 
This bipartisan measure will raise aware-
ness in the South Asian community about 
alarming increases in heart disease and invest 
in ways to reverse this trend. 
South Asians in the United States are those 
who immigrated or whose families immigrated 
from countries including India, Pakistan, Ban-
gladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. South Asians 
represent the sixth largest and fastest-growing 
ethnic group in our nation. 
Despite a traditional diet high in lentils, 
vegetables, grains and spices, heart disease 
is on the rise in these communities. A Stan-
ford study found that South Asians’ risk of 
having a heart attack before 50 is four times 
greater than the general population’s. 
South Asians also have the highest preva-
lence of Type 2 diabetes. As diabetes is one 
of the most serious drivers of heart disease, 
stats underscore the urgent need for action. 
The tools and research this bill promotes 
will give us the insight needed to save lives 
not just in the South Asian community, but the 
greater public, too. 
I thank Congresswoman JAYAPAL for her vi-
sion in developing this bill and urge my col-
leagues to support it.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, more than 8 percent 
of children in the U.S. under the age of 
18 live with asthma. For these children 
and children with respiratory issues 
caused by asthma, access to appro-
priate treatment and trained personnel 
can mean the difference between life 
and death in emergency situations. 
In 2004, Congress authorized chil-
dren’s asthma treatment grants to ex-
pand access to medical care for chil-
dren who live in areas with a preva-
lence of asthma. Today, CDC provides 
financial assistance to health depart-
ments in 24 States and Puerto Rico to 
ensure that guidelines-based medical 
management and pharmacotherapy for 
those with asthma are both available 
and accessible. The CDC also offers 
funding to State programs and na-
tional organizations promoting asthma 
quality measures and informing policy-
makers about the burden of asthma. 
H.R. 2468, the School-Based Allergies 
and Management Program Act, takes 
the most recent data and builds on this 
program to make it work best for kids 
and schools today. To achieve this, 
preference will be given for certain 
grants to States that require schools to 
have a school-based allergies and asth-
ma program, as well as the presence of 
a school nurse or other trained per-
sonnel who can support students and 
staff treat those with allergies and 
asthma. 
Helping States and schools to better 
support students and families treat 
asthma and allergies is critical to the 
health and well-being of our students, 
and this bill will go a long way towards 
achieving this goal. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Ma-
jority Leader HOYER for his leadership 
on this bill as well as our colleague, 
Representative ROE. I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2468, the School-Based Al-
lergies and Asthma Management Pro-
gram Act, introduced by Representa-
tives ROE and HOYER. 
This important legislation would di-
rect the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, in making asthma-re-
lated grants, to give preference to 
States that require schools to imple-
ment policies that improve the care of 
children with allergies and asthma. 
These policies include having plans in 
place for managing students with aller-
gies and asthma and having at least 
one person trained to administer res-
cue medication on the premises during 
operating hours. 
By incentivizing States to have com-
prehensive school-based asthma and al-
lergy management programs in place, 
this bill will help ensure that school 
nurses, staff, and administrators are 
prepared to help students with aller-
gies and asthma excel at school in a 
safe environment. 
I want to thank Dr. ROE and Leader 
HOYER, who have championed the cause 
of ensuring children at school have ac-
cess to needed medicines for many, 
many years. 
I also want to thank Dr. ROE for his 
years of service to this institution. 
Like some of the rest of us, he, too, 
will be retiring at the end of this year. 
As a veteran, as a doctor, and as a lead-
er—and, by the way, as a great musi-
cian, not that he will be able to per-
form that here on the House floor—he 
has done so much for veterans, for im-
proving healthcare, and for the people 
of the district he represents. He has 
left his mark, and he doesn’t have to 
worry about whether he made a dif-
ference, because he has. 
So, Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), who is our majority leader. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my friend, the chairman of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, and 
Mr. WALDEN, the ranking member of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
for bringing this bill to the floor. 
But, most of all, I want to thank my 
friend, Dr. PHIL ROE from Tennessee. 
He is a medical doctor. He and I, as Mr. 
WALDEN pointed out, for many, many 
years have been focused on making 
sure that those children with asthma 
are safer in the school than they other-
wise would be if the schools were not 
prepared to deal with an asthmatic or 
allergic attack. I want to thank Dr. 
ROE, who has been such a steadfast ally 
and partner in this effort. 
I am hopeful that this bill will go to 
the Senate, and when we come back in 
the lameduck, hopefully, we will pass 
this and we will have another bipar-
tisan bill that will help children and 
the school systems of America. 
I am proud to be joined by Dr. ROE. It 
is emblematic of when you have a prob-
lem that is needed to be solved, Madam 
Speaker; it is not a partisan problem. 
These are not partisan issues. These 
are issues that kids have, families 
have, and schools have. 
We stood together on this floor 7 
years ago when the House passed our 
School Access to Emergency Epineph-
rine Act. President Obama signed that 
bipartisan bill into law in November 
2013. It encouraged States to adopt 
policies that require schools to stock 
emergency epinephrine and train staff 
how to use it in case a student experi-
ences a severe allergy or asthma at-
tack. Those attacks can result in 
death. 
This is not just an inconvenience; 
this is just not an illness; it is a mortal 
challenge, and I am proud that we got 
that bill done together and we do 
again, today, the same. 
This new bipartisan legislation would 
build on that earlier success, as the 
ranking member and chairman of have 
all explained, by providing additional 
incentives for States to ensure that 
American schools create asthma man-
agement plans for students who need 
them. 
This is not a difficult task, I might 
say, and it is not an expensive task, 
but it has a lifesaving result. 
I know all too well how terrifying se-
vere childhood asthma can be. I was di-
agnosed with asthma at age 4 when I 
went to the hospital in Mexia, Texas. 
My father was stationed at a POW 
camp in Mexia, Texas, not too far from 
Galveston. So I know the consequences 
of asthma. 
In addition to that, my grand-
daughter has experienced severe food 
allergies, a peanut allergy which is so 
much more evident today than it was, 
for whatever reason, and is life threat-
ening. I have been with my grand-
daughter twice in the emergency room. 
Luckily, she got there in time so that 
her life was not in danger, but had she 
not gotten there in a timely fashion, it 
would have been. 
Like many families, we constantly 
have to be vigilant and always keep 
asthma inhalers present. My grand-
daughter always keeps an EpiPen with 
her. She is 18 years of age, and she does 
not go anywhere without an EpiPen. 
Very 
frankly, 
my 
daughter, 
her 
mother, every school that she went to, 
counseled with the principal, with the 
teacher, and with the school personnel 
to let them know, A, that Alexa had 
that challenge and, B, how to help her 
deal with it. 
b 1500 
Having a plan to manage asthma and 
peanut allergies makes a critical dif-
ference. This legislation will help re-
duce school absenteeism, for which 
asthma is one of the leading causes. I 
know that because as an elementary 
school and junior high school student, 
I lost significant time because of asth-
ma. 
Madam Speaker, again, I thank Dr. 
ROE for his leadership on this issue and 
for working with me on these bills over 
the years. He is retiring at the end of 
this Congress, and I will certainly miss 
working with him. We will miss his ex-
pertise here in the Congress of the 
United States, and I know the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce will 
miss his advice and counsel as well. I 
believe that legislation like this and 
the law we enacted in 2013 will be a fit-
ting part of his legacy of public service. 
Madam Speaker, I hope that all of 
our colleagues will join us in sup-
porting this legislation and in thank-
ing Dr. ROE for his efforts to ensure 
that protecting our Nation’s children 
against asthma consequences remains 
a truly bipartisan effort. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the majority leader for his com-
ments in support and authorship of this

legislation. Our son battled childhood 
asthma. It is a really scary thing as a 
parent to watch a child deal with an 
asthma attack. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. ROE), the 
champion of this legislation, the great 
champion for a positive public health 
outcome for all of us, especially for our 
veterans. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 2468, the School-Based Al-
lergies and Asthma Management Pro-
gram Act, a bill I have been proud to 
work on with my friend, Leader HOYER, 
that will help students with asthma 
excel in an asthma-friendly learning 
environment. 
Madam Speaker, I will say that I had 
the privilege of visiting Mr. WALDEN’s 
district a few years ago when we were 
working on the VA MISSION Act, and 
he explained to me that his congres-
sional district had more square miles 
than the State of Tennessee. I didn’t 
believe that, but it happens to be true. 
It has more square miles. And that one 
statement really helped me in com-
posing that bill. 
I also thank Leader HOYER—when he 
mentioned that in 2013, we didn’t know 
each other very well then, but we got 
to know each other. And that bill, the 
EpiPen bill it is called, passed. And in 
my own community, just a community 
about 20 miles north of me, not 2, 3 
years ago, a middle school student, 
who didn’t know she had allergies, had 
anaphylaxis, and because the EpiPen 
was available, because of Mr. HOYER’s 
work and others, that child survived. 
I also thank Mr. PALLONE and Mr. 
WALDEN. Remember the incredible ar-
guments we had about the cost of the 
EpiPen? I travel with one all the time 
because I am more concerned about an 
allergy of some kind when I travel. 
They always ask on airplanes: ‘‘Is 
there a doctor here?’’ I am always with 
one. And you all helped push the price 
of that down—your work on that did— 
from $600, which was absurd for an 
EpiPen. 
And you know, Mr. HOYER, with your 
daughter, I don’t care how much 
money you have, that is a lot of money 
to pay. And you have to have two of 
them, not one. So that price has 
dropped dramatically because I think a 
lot of the work this Congress has done. 
Last week marked the beginning of 
fall, as we all know. And for many of 
us, the cooler weather means the re-
turn to football and a new school 
year—different school year, but back. 
For millions of other Americans living 
with asthma, seasonal allergies, and 
other 
respiratory 
diseases, 
these 
changes of temperature mean difficulty 
breathing. 
There are roughly 6 million school- 
aged children in the U.S. currently liv-
ing with asthma. This is one of the 
leading causes of absenteeism. In fact, 
according to the National Asthma Edu-
cation and Prevention Program, par-
ents have reported that students col-
lectively miss 14 million days of school 
every year due to asthma alone. While 
asthma poses serious health risks, it 
can be effectively managed with proper 
education, planning, and treatment, 
and does not have to negatively impact 
a child’s access to education. 
The Department of Education and 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services both recommend that schools 
have comprehensive management pro-
grams in place to support children with 
lower airway disorders like asthma and 
keep these disorders under control 
while they are at school. Unfortu-
nately, most schools do not have such 
programs in place. And that is why our 
bill, the School-Based Allergies and 
Asthma Management Program uses a 
proven model to encourage States to 
ensure schools are prepared to help 
children suffering from asthma. 
The two most important strategies 
for preparing schools are implementing 
management plans and ensuring that 
school staff members are prepared to 
assist children experiencing an attack. 
Our bill encourages States to do just 
that. This type of preparation and 
management in schools will not only 
improve a child’s health but also en-
sure that students are able to focus on 
learning. No student should be at risk 
in a school because of a failure for 
them to manage a respiratory disorder. 
The good news is that together, we can 
fix this. 
The start of the new school year 
serves as a valuable reminder of the 
work that still needs to be done, and I 
look forward to passing this bipartisan 
legislation today and getting it one 
step closer to the President’s desk so 
that students with asthma and aller-
gies can focus on their education. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle for 
their very, very kind comments, and I 
encourage support of this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge support of this legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 2468, the ‘‘School-Based 
Allergies and Asthma Management Program 
Act,’’ which would provide important guidance 
to schools on how to support students who 
have asthma. 
Across the United States nearly 25 million 
people have been diagnosed with asthma, in-
cluding almost 7 million children. 
Childhood asthma is a common, chronic pe-
diatric condition, affecting 6.3 million children. 
Morbidity from childhood asthma adversely 
affects school performance, with 1 in 2 chil-
dren reporting school absences due to asthma 
each year. 
These asthma related absences influence 
academic achievement, leading to decreased 
levels of reading proficiency and increased 
risk of learning disabilities. 
Improving health and school-related out-
comes for children with asthma requires the 
use of school-based partnerships that focus 
on integrated care coordination amongst fami-
lies, clinicians, and school nurses. 
The best defense to asthma attacks is im-
mediate treatment as soon as symptoms 
present themselves. 
Instead of contributing to the nearly 2 million 
asthma-related emergency room visits each 
year, this bill would provide schools with the 
necessary guidance on how to treat asthma 
attacks and support lung health of student 
while in school and at home. 
Improving health and school-related out-
comes for children with asthma requires the 
use of school-based partnerships that focus 
on integrated care coordination amongst fami-
lies, clinicians and school nurses. 
Every day in America 30,000 Americans 
have an asthma attack, and 11 are killed by 
them. 
The School-based Asthma Management 
Program as outlined by H.R. 2468, is sup-
ported by the American Academy of Allergy, 
Asthma & Immunology. 
For asthma care, the School-based Asthma 
Management Program has four components to 
integrate schools, and specifically school 
nurses, within the asthma care team. 
First, the creation of a Circle of Support 
amongst the families, clinicians and schools’ 
nurses are centered around the child with 
asthma. 
Second, the creation and transmission of 
Asthma Management Plans to schools, which 
includes an Asthma Emergency Treatment 
Plan for emergency management of asthma 
symptoms and an individualized Asthma Ac-
tion Plan for each child with asthma. 
Third, the development of a comprehensive 
Asthma Education Plan for school personnel. 
Finally, a comprehensive Environmental 
Asthma Plan to assess and remediate asthma 
triggers at home and in school. 
This bill is supported by the American Acad-
emy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology 
(AAAAI) and the National Association of 
School Nurses (NASN). 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting 
this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2468, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 5572. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5572, the Family Support 
Services for Addiction Act of 2020. 
According to new data from the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration, nearly 20 million 
Americans live with a substance use 
disorder. While we are making progress 
in connecting Americans with treat-
ment, the reality is that only a frac-
tion of those Americans receives the 
care they really need. 
The Family Support Services for Ad-
diction Act builds upon recent congres-
sional efforts, such as the 21st Century 
Cures Act and the SUPPORT for Pa-
tients and Communities Act, to help 
close the treatment gap and get Ameri-
cans on the road to recovery. We know 
that families can play a significant 
role in helping an individual find treat-
ment, yet there isn’t a one-size-fits-all 
solution to ensuring a family member 
or loved one can get the care they 
need. We also know that substance use 
disorders affect more than just the in-
dividual. It affects the family in its en-
tirety. 
Madam Speaker, as my colleagues 
and I heard during our hearings on this 
bill, getting families evidence-based 
guidance and connecting them with 
other community support systems can 
dramatically influence the trajectory 
of an individual’s path to recovery. 
That is exactly what this bill sets out 
to do. 
H.R. 5572 would authorize the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to award grants to family community 
organizations that would work to de-
velop, expand, and enhance evidence- 
based family support services. These 
family community organizations can 
use the grant to reduce stigma around 
substance use disorder and build con-
nections between families and pro-
viders, foster care services, and other 
peer-support services. 
Madam Speaker, given the impact of 
this drug epidemic, chances are that 
many of us know someone—whether it 
be a loved one, a neighbor, a co-worker, 
or a classmate—who has a substance 
use disorder. And while we know that 
substance use disorders are complex, 
they are treatable. An individual’s road 
to treatment can be driven by family 
supports encouraged through this legis-
lation. 
I commend the lead sponsor of this 
legislation, 
Representative 
DAVID 
TRONE and also Representative DANIEL 
MEUSER, and their staff, for advocating 
for additional support for families. I 
also thank the Democratic and Repub-
lican members of our committee, as 
well as bipartisan committee staff, for 
working together to move this bill, and 
I hope the Senate will act on it swiftly. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5572, the Family Support Services 
for Addiction Act, which was intro-
duced by Representatives Trone and 
Meuser. 
This 
legislation 
would 
establish 
grant programs for family community 
organizations to provide evidence-in-
formed and family-based approaches to 
substance use and addiction manage-
ment. Family-based approaches have 
demonstrated stronger outcomes in 
substance use disorder recovery when 
compared with individual approaches, 
as they address several psychosocial di-
mensions of addiction and strengthen 
support networks for affected individ-
uals. 
Madam Speaker, the legislation be-
fore us today supports family commu-
nity organizations that are committed 
to pursuing evidence-based interven-
tions for substance use disorder, reduce 
the stigma of addiction, and strengthen 
both families and communities through 
recovery.

September 29, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I thank our two col-
leagues that sponsored this important 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
TRONE). 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to show my support for the mil-
lions of families struggling to help 
their loved ones suffering through ad-
diction. 
My family fought to get help for my 
nephew, Ian, that he needed before he 
lost his life to an overdose in 2016. It 
was hard for us to do, even with the re-
sources we had at our disposal. 
For most families, it is nearly impos-
sible to navigate our behavioral health 
system in its current form. It is a con-
fusing system that leaves families like 
mine with no clue what treatment op-
tion is right for their loved one. 
Now more than ever, families are on 
the front lines of this fight. Overdoses 
are on the rise across America, and 
COVID–19 is making matters much 
worse. Every single county in my dis-
trict saw an increase in overdose 
deaths last quarter—some as much as 
50 percent. And last year, more Ameri-
cans died of drug overdoses than ever 
before—more than 70,000. 
Madam Speaker, that is why I intro-
duced the Family Support Services for 
Addiction Act with Congressman DAN 
MEUSER. This bipartisan bill provides 
for nonprofits working with families 
struggling with addiction. The bill will 
provide grants to reach more families, 
create more tailored treatments, and 
save more lives. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
man 
MEUSER, 
Chairman 
PALLONE, 
Chairwoman ESHOO, and Ranking Mem-
ber WALDEN for this much-needed bill. 
We have got to get this done. Lives are 
depending on it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this legislation. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
MEUSER), one of the coauthors of this 
very, very important and meaningful 
legislation, who serves Pennsylvania’s 
Ninth Congressional District in the 
U.S. House. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is 
really my honor to be here today in 
support with Congressman TRONE, and 
I thank him for his partnership and his 
leadership on this very important 
issue. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer 
support for our bill, H.R. 5572, the Fam-
ily Support Services for Addiction Act, 
which provides a family and commu-
nity-based approach to addiction treat-
ment that works to address the deep- 
seated effects of the addiction crisis on 
so many families. 
The opioid epidemic is ravaging my 
district and many States across Amer-
ica, and all of Pennsylvania is by no 
means an exception. In 2017, Pennsyl-
vania experienced 5,456 drug-related 
overdose deaths. It has impacted vir-
tually every family throughout the 
Commonwealth. 
Far too many families struggling 
with substance use disorder feel like 
they have nowhere to turn for the re-
sources and very important informa-
tion. 
b 1515 
This bill would establish a grant pro-
gram for family community organiza-
tions that provide support for families 
of individuals struggling with sub-
stance use disorder. These services can 
include 
information 
and 
referral 
sources, support groups, system navi-
gation to assist the family in finding 
resources, parent training and edu-
cation, specialized crisis support, and, 
really, much, much more, again, where 
they currently don’t know where to 
turn. 
As a member of the Freshman Work-
ing Group on Addiction, I am very 
proud to be the Republican lead on a 
bill that takes critical steps to help 
families feel empowered and equipped 
to support their loved ones struggling 
with substance use disorder. 
I again want to very, very sincerely 
congratulate and thank Congressman 
DAVID TRONE for his hard work, his 
dedication, and his great care in help-
ing those suffering from drug addic-
tion. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I urge its swift passage. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
also urge support for the bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 5572, the ‘‘Family Support Serv-
ices for Addiction Act of 2020.’’ I’m proud to 
have advanced this bipartisan bill through my 
Health Subcommittee and I’m pleased to sup-
port it on the Floor today. 
H.R. 5572, the ‘‘Family Support Services for 
Addiction Act of 2020’’ was introduced by 
Reps. DAVID
TRONE
(D–MD) and DANIEL 
MEUSER (R–PA) and provides grants to com-
munity organizations that provide support 
services for families and family members living 
with substance use disorders or addiction. 
When family members are empowered and 
supported to help their loved one struggling 
with substance use disorder, patients and fam-
ilies achieve better outcomes. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention estimated that more than 70,000 peo-
ple died in the U.S. from an opioid overdose 
in 2019. These numbers are projected to be 
higher in 2020, in part because of the COVID 
pandemic. We have to do everything we can 
to address the substance use disorder crisis 
by helping patients and their families. I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5572, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 2075. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2075, the School-Based Health 
Centers Reauthorization Act, which re-
authorizes school-based health centers. 
These centers serve as critical access 
points that provide comprehensive care 
to children and adolescents in their 
school, a location that is safe, conven-
ient, and accessible. They provide this 
care through partnerships with com-
munity health providers, such as feder-
ally qualified health centers, public 
health departments, hospitals, schools, 
and other community institutions. 
School-based health centers serve 
primarily low-income and medically 
underserved populations of children 
and adolescents. These centers, Madam 
Speaker, are a powerful tool for achiev-
ing health equity among children and 
adolescents who unjustly experience 
disparities in health outcomes because 
of ethnicity, race, or family income. 
While many communities struggle 
with ways to keep students healthy, 
school-based health centers are more 
important than ever. H.R. 2075 would 
reauthorize school-based health centers 
through fiscal year 2024, ensuring con-
tinued access to these centers for the 
children and families who need them 
most. 
I want to thank Representatives SAR-
BANES, TONKO, UPTON, and STEFANIK for 
their bipartisan leadership on this leg-
islation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2075. This is the School- 
Based Health Centers Reauthorization 
Act of 2020. It was introduced by Rep-
resentative SARBANES, whom I know we 
are going to hear from in a moment; 
Congressman UPTON, former chairman 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee; and Representatives STEFANIK 
and TONKO. 
This bill reauthorizes the School- 
Based Health Centers program, which 
supports the provision of primary care, 
behavioral healthcare, dental health, 
counseling, nutritional education, and 
so many other really critical health 
services in our schools. 
Madam Speaker, I remember back in 
my days in the State legislature sup-
porting community-based, school-based 
healthcare because, oftentimes, this 
was the only place many of our chil-
dren could get basic healthcare serv-
ices. It is so essential. 
I know, during the pandemic, we are 
getting reports from our doctors and 
others that say this loss of access to 
these kinds of services is taking its 
toll, especially in mental health serv-
ices. 
These health centers usually operate 
as a partnership between the school 
and a community health organization 
so that the services provided by the 
health center best meet the needs of 
the community and the local school 
district. 
As I said, in the midst of the COVID– 
19 
pandemic, 
the 
need 
for 
basic 
healthcare has not gone away just be-
cause students are learning from home. 
School-based health centers will con-
tinue to help in keeping students 
healthy and ready to learn, and we 
should reauthorize them, as we do in 
this act. 
So I urge support of this measure, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
SARBANES). 
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Chairman PALLONE for 
his leadership of our committee with 
respect to all of these bills, particu-
larly the health bills we are talking 
about today, and, also, Ranking Mem-
ber WALDEN. As you know, many of 
these are bipartisan. They reflect the 
input and work of Members over a pe-
riod of years. 
I am very pleased that H.R. 2075, the 
School-Based Health Centers Reauthor-
ization Act, is on the floor today. I in-
troduced this bill with our colleagues, 
Representatives STEFANIK, TONKO, and 
UPTON. I want to thank them for their 
work and the bipartisan dimension of 
this effort. 
This would reauthorize, as was indi-
cated, Federal support for school-based 
health centers through 2024. These are 
institutions that provide critical pri-
mary and mental health services to 
vulnerable children and youth. 
‘‘Institutions’’ may not be the best 
word. Teams of professionals, I think, 
is how you describe these school-based 
health centers across the country. 
These health centers really marshal 
response to the needs of young people 
in schools in a way that you really 
can’t replicate anywhere else in the 
community. That is why they are so 
vital. 
They offer comprehensive healthcare 
to youth, delivering it in a setting 
where they already spend, obviously, 
much of their time, a captive audience, 
in a sense. Let’s take advantage of that 
and provide the services that they 
need. 
There are 80 school-based health cen-
ters in the State of Maryland—I am fa-
miliar with many of them, having vis-
ited a number—and over 2,500 of them 
nationwide that serve 6.3 million stu-
dents. Many of these school-based 
health centers provide care to under-
served communities. In fact, over a 
third of them are located in rural 
areas. 
What the research shows us is that, 
when a student has access to a school- 
based health center, we see a decrease 
in negative outcomes, such as asthma 
morbidity and the rate of hospital ad-
missions, while educational outcomes, 
such as school performance and grad-
uation rates, increase. 
Now, of course, the services that 
school-based health centers provide are 
needed more than ever, given the 
coronavirus pandemic. Young people 
are grappling with uncertainty and 
changes to their lives, and being able 
to receive care in a familiar and sup-
portive setting is critically important. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for 
their support of this, and I urge all of 
the Members to support this bill. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I call 
on my colleagues to support this im-
portant legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support the bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as 
the Founding Chair of the Congressional Chil-
dren’s Caucus and a senior member of the Ju-
diciary and Homeland Security Committees, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 2075, the 
‘‘School-Based Health Centers Reauthoriza-
tion Act,’’ which reauthorizes school-based 
health centers through Fiscal Year 2024 as 
well as make technical changes that allow 
more health centers, that serve medically un-
derserved children and adolescents, to quality 
for funding. 
First and foremost, I would like to thank 
Representatives SARBANES, TONKO, STEFANIK, 
and UPTON for their leadership on this key 
piece of legislation. 
In 2014, the authorization for school-based 
health centers lapsed. 
By passing H.R. 2075, Congress would rec-
tify this issue and help deliver primary care, in-
cluding dental screenings and mental health 
services, to millions of American students. 
These health centers are a powerful tool for 
achieving health equity among children and 
adolescents who unjustly experience dispari-
ties in outcomes because of their race and 
family income. 
Improved access to school-based health 
centers is tied to reducing negative health out-
comes, such as asthma morbidity and the rate 
of hospital admissions as well as increasing 
positive outcomes like educational outcomes, 
school performance, and graduation rates. 
Across the United States, there are over 
2,500 school-based health centers and ap-
proximately one-third of them are in rural

areas, which traditionally suffer from limited 
access to care. 
The coronavirus pandemic has shed a light 
on the current disparities riddled throughout 
our health care system. 
As an increasing number of students go 
back to school, schools are on the front line in 
terms of managing the pandemic, and school- 
based health centers will be at the center of 
that response, making this reauthorization 
more essential than ever. 
We must utilize this opportunity to strength-
en these programs with additional federal 
funding. 
I ask my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to come together and pass this important 
legislation.

(1) by redesignating subsection (n) as sub-
section (o); and 
(2) by inserting after subsection (m) the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(n) In this section: 
‘‘(1) The term ‘epidemiology center’ means an 
epidemiology center established under section 
214 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, 
including such Tribal epidemiology centers serv-
ing Indian Tribes regionally and any Tribal epi-

read as follows: 
‘‘(o)(1) To carry out this section, there is au-
thorized to be appropriated $185,000,000 for each

year, the Secretary shall not use more than 10 
percent for the combined costs of— 
‘‘(A) administration of this section; and 
‘‘(B) carrying out subsection (m)(2).’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 7948. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the health of Amer-
ican Indian and Alaska Native popu-
lations lags behind all other races in 
the United States. Economic adversity 
and poor social conditions have con-
tributed to disproportionate disease 
burden, lower life expectancies, and 
other health inequalities in Tribal 
communities. Tragically, Tribal mem-
bers are expected to live 5.5 fewer years 
than other races. 
Now, the coronavirus pandemic has 
further highlighted these longstanding 
health inequalities. According to CDC 
data, more than one-third of non-
elderly American Indians and Alaska 
Natives are at high risk of developing a 
serious illness resulting from a COVID– 
19 infection, compared with one-fifth of 
the White nonelderly adults. 
Today, we are taking an important 
step in improving health outcomes by 
improving data access for Tribal Epide-
miology Centers. These centers manage 
regional public health information sys-
tems, disease prevention and control 
programs, and coordinate with other 
public health authorities in the collec-
tion and study of epidemiological data. 
None of these functions work if Fed-
eral, State, and local partners are not 
sharing relevant data in a secured 
manner. 
H.R. 7948, the Tribal Health Data Im-
provement Act, ensures that Tribal Na-
tions are equipped with the necessary 
public health data to operate public 
health programs and improve health 
outcomes within their communities. It 
does this by clarifying the Federal role 
in collection and availability of health 
data with respect to Indian Tribes. 
The legislation also mandates ways 
of improving health statistics report-
ing with respect to Indian Tribes, such 
as requiring the Secretary to release 
all applicable public health data on 
Tribal Epidemiology Centers within 180 
days of enactment and requiring the 
CDC to expand and improve their as-
sistance to States with respect to shar-
ing data with Tribal entities. 
Finally, the bill reauthorizes the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics 
with additional funding for the new 
programs that are established by the 
bill. 
I want to thank Representatives 
GIANFORTE, LUJA´ N, RODGERS, MULLIN, 
O’HALLERAN, and RUIZ for the excellent 
bipartisan work on this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 7948, the Tribal 
Health Data Improvement Act, intro-
duced by my Energy and Commerce 
Committee colleagues, Representatives 
GIANFORTE, 
RUIZ, 
RODGERS, 
O’HALLERAN, and LUJA´ N. 
This 
is 
really 
important 
public 
health legislation. It addresses some 
chronic challenges that are faced by 
Tribal Nations and Tribal Epidemi-
ology Centers as they try to gain ac-
cess to critical Federal healthcare and 
public health surveillance data. 
Obtaining this data is critical for en-
gaging in preventive public health 
work and combating current health 
crises in American Indian and Alaska 
Native communities. However, struc-
tural barriers to accessing data have 
been especially problematic during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, which, tragically, 
has disproportionately impacted these 
very communities. 
In order to ensure Tribal Nations and 
Tribal Epidemiology Centers have ac-
cess to the data necessary to accom-
plish public health priorities, this leg-
islation 
requires 
the 
Secretary 
of 
Health and Human Services to create a 
data-sharing strategy that takes into 
consideration the recommendations of 
the Secretary’s Tribal Advisory Com-
mittee. 
In addition, in reauthorizing the 
CDC’s National Center for Health Sta-
tistics, the bill requires the Secretary 
to make public health surveillance 
data available to the Indian Health 
Service, Indian Tribes, Tribal organiza-
tions, and Tribal Epidemiology Cen-
ters, so long as the data requested for 
use is consistent with Federal law and, 
of course, obligations. 
The Secretary must also consult with 
Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, 
urban Indian organizations, and the 
Tribal Health Advisory Group of the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services to develop guidelines for State 
and local health agencies to improve 
the quality and accuracy of birth and 
death records of American Indians and 
Alaska Natives. 
By improving the sharing of data be-
tween the Federal Government and the 
Tribes, this important bill would help 
address the health disparities in Amer-
ican Indian and Alaska Native commu-
nities. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
b 1530 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. 
LUJA´ N), a leader on Tribal issues. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam Speaker, during 
this COVID–19 pandemic, which has al-
ready killed more than 200,000 Ameri-
cans, it is crucial that the CDC and 
State health departments are sharing 
essential, lifesaving public health data 
from Tribal epidemiology centers to 
protect the health of the people they 
serve. 
TECs, like any State or local health 
department, are legally entitled to ac-
cess to the same data, but for the first 
months of the public health emer-
gency, this data was withheld, despite 
the urging of Tribal leaders, myself, 
and fellow members of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
This data, including information on 
COVID–19 testing, positive case num-
bers, contact tracing, and more, is es-
sential for Tribes and TECs to protect 
the health and well-being of the com-
munities they serve. 
That 
is 
why 
Representative 
GIANFORTE and I introduced the bipar-
tisan Tribal Health Data Improvement 
Act with the support of the National

Indian Health Board. While the CDC 
Director has fulfilled the commitment 
he made to me to share COVID-related 
data with all the TECs, there are still 
barriers to accessing other important 
data sets that are crucial to protecting 
the public health during and after this 
pandemic. 
This important legislation makes it 
clear that the Department of Health 
and Human Services and State health 
departments are required to share data 
with Tribal health authorities, and it 
includes additional funding to make 
this happen. 
This legislation is about justice and 
living up to the Federal Government’s 
legal responsibility. It would help save 
lives as we continue working to defeat 
this virus. Tribes and TECs are work-
ing hard to protect public health in 
their communities, and it is their right 
to access the CDC data to do so. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
seeing the House pass this legislation, 
and I will urge my colleagues in the 
Senate to act with the same urgency. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my colleagues, espe-
cially my friend from New Mexico for 
his leadership on this legislation. I 
would just say that they have all 
worked very hard on this. It is extraor-
dinarily important to pass this. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
also urge support of the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7948, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 5469. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5469, the Pursuing Equity 
in Mental Health Act. 
We have long known that people of 
color 
experience 
inequities 
in 
healthcare in the United States. While 
we have made progress to close these 
gaps in recent years, including with 
the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 
people of color in America continue to 
experience inequities in care and worse 
health outcomes compared to White 
Americans. 
These long-term trends are rooted in 
several social determinants that are 
often driven by structural discrimina-
tion 
and 
institutionalized 
racism, 
which has created systemic health in-
equity. 
The tragic results of these long-term 
trends are that people of color are 
more likely to suffer from underlying 
health conditions and have a much 
harder time getting access to care, and 
when they do, they are far more likely 
to experience bias, discrimination, and 
poor health outcomes. 
The 
Congressional 
Black 
Caucus’ 
Emergency Task Force on Black Youth 
Suicide and Mental Health reiterated 
these points in a report last year that 
raised concerns about the increasing 
rates of suicide and mental health 
trends among Black children. The need 
to address these increased suicide rates 
has been recognized by public health 
experts, including the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health Director, Dr. 
Joshua Gordon. He recently wrote 
about mental health inequities, saying 
these gaps ‘‘lead to worse mental 
health outcomes in underserved and 
minority communities.’’ 
In testimony before our committee, 
the American Psychological Associa-
tion president, Dr. Arthur Evans, also 
underscored the need to diversify our 
mental health workforce if we are to 
improve care for communities of color. 
The bill before us today, H.R. 5469, is 
aimed specifically at addressing equity 
in mental health. The bill would invest 
resources into better understanding ra-
cial and ethnic minority mental health 
disparities, improve outreach and sup-
port for racial and ethnic minorities, 
and expand provider support for stu-
dents of color entering the mental 
health workforce. 
I am hopeful, Madam Speaker, that 
this bill will help reduce the inequities 
in mental health. Before I conclude, I 
want to thank my colleague from New 
Jersey, Representative BONNIE WATSON 
COLEMAN, and her staff for leading this 
important bill. I also thank Ranking 
Member WALDEN and his staff for work-
ing with us in a bipartisan manner to 
move this bill forward. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5469. This is the Pursuing 
Equity in Mental Health Act, and it is 
sponsored by Representative WATSON 
COLEMAN. It helps address suicide and 
mental illness in youth for minority 
and underserved communities. 
Despite improvements in health eq-
uity, disparities in mental health care 
persist. The Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality has reported that 
racial and ethnic minority groups in 
the United States are less likely to 
have access to mental health services 
and less likely to use community men-
tal health services, but more likely to 
use emergency departments and more 
likely to receive lower quality care. 
Poor mental health care access and 
quality ultimately contribute to poorer 
outcomes, 
including 
suicide 
among 
these populations. These issues are es-
pecially acute in minority youth popu-
lations. 
H.R. 5469 would help address these 
disparities. It authorizes grants tar-
geted at high-poverty communities for 
culturally and linguistically appro-
priate mental health services. It sup-
ports mental health disparities re-
search, requires the studying of the im-
pact of smartphones and social media 
on adolescents, and authorizes the Mi-
nority Fellowship Program to support 
more students of color entering the 
mental health workforce. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank the majority for taking the time 
to work with us to get this bill in a 
really good place. It is an important 
initiative, and I am pleased to see it 
getting a vote on the House floor 
today, Madam Speaker. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join both the chairman of 
the committee and myself in sup-
porting this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
also urge support for the bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
cosponsor and senior member of the Judiciary 
and Homeland Security Committees, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 5469, the ‘‘Pursuing 
Equity in Mental Health Act of 2019,’’ which 
addresses mental health issues for youth, par-
ticularly youth of color. 
According to Mental Health America, Black 
and African American teenagers are more like-
ly to attempt suicide than White teenagers, 
and suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts 
have been rising in recent years.

Furthermore, in the United States, over 
seven million people who identify as Black or 
African American reported having a mental ill-
ness in the past year. 
This legislation will combat the issue of sui-
cide and mental health in youth from all com-
munities by focusing on a few key areas: sup-
port in schools, scientific research, and in-
crease funding in existing programs. 
Specifically, the bill provides $250 million to 
schools across the country, so they can have 
more culturally and linguistically appropriate 
mental health services. 
The bill stipulates that priority will be given 
to schools with higher levels of poverty, to re-
ducing the ratio of counselors to students and 
to helping more students of color. 
These grants will also provide training for 
teachers and other school staff, so they can 
better identify the signs of trauma, mental 
health disorders, and risk of suicide in all stu-
dents. 
Additionally, H.R. 5469 provides $20 million 
to establish interprofessional health care 
teams that can provide behavioral health care. 
Madam Speaker, I am particularly sup-
portive of this bill’s efforts to develop cultural 
competency educational curricula so that stu-
dents who are training to be social workers, 
psychologists, psychiatrists, and therapists will 
be able to properly treat youth of color. 
This is imperative as we look to improve 
support for mental health for future genera-
tions. 
Furthermore, the bill directs the Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS) to es-
tablish a Commission on the Effects of 
Smartphone and Social Media Usage on Ado-
lescents as well as prohibits federal funds 
from being used for conversion therapy and 
prohibits SAMHSA grants from going to states 
that continue to allow such practices. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Con-
gresswoman BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN for her 
leadership on this key piece of legislation. 
I ask my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to come together and pass this important 
legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5469, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR 
STUDENTS ACT OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I

bill (H.R. 1109) to amend the Public

tion and heading and inserting the following: 
‘‘PART G—SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL 
HEALTH’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1109. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1109, the Mental Health 
Services for Students Act of 2020. 
Research shows that half of all life-
time mental illness begins by the age 
of 14. According to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, about 
three in four children between the ages 
of 3 and 17 suffer from depression and 
anxiety, and nearly half have behav-
ioral problems. In fact, recent data 
from Mental Health America show that 
youth between the ages of 11 and 17 are 
now at higher risk of moderate to se-
vere anxiety and depression. 
For many students, schools are a 
critical place to get mental health sup-
port. Now, with added public health 
concerns, economic pressures, online 
learning, and the social isolation that 
comes with these things, experts worry 
about the added repercussions we will 
be seeing on the well-being of students 
across the country. 
The data and the effect of the pan-
demic make clear that we must do 
more to invest in preventative mental 
health services and training in schools 
to give our kids and teens a brighter 
future. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
Committee on School Health recog-
nized the increasing mental health 
needs of children and adolescents when 
it 
said 
that 
‘‘school-based 
mental 
health services offer the potential for 
prevention efforts as well as interven-
tion strategies.’’ H.R. 1109 does just 
that. 
This bill would support comprehen-
sive mental health programs at schools 
across the Nation by encouraging part-
nerships between State and local edu-
cational agencies and mental health 
providers. Funding would be made 
available through the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration to support prevention screen-
ing, treatment, and development of 
evidence-based programs for social, 
emotional, and mental and behavioral 
issues among students. This bill will 
also help us better understand the stu-
dent, family, and educational outcomes 
of services provided to students. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
lead sponsors of this bill, Representa-
tives GRACE
NAPOLITANO
and JOHN 
KATKO, for their leadership and their 
work. I also thank, of course, Ranking 
Member WALDEN and the members of 
our committee for their bipartisan sup-
port for this bill. 
Madam Speaker, it is critical that we 
support preventative mental health 
services and training in schools for our 
kids and teens, particularly at a time 
when mental health risks are exacer-
bated by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support 
today of H.R. 1109. 
This is the Mental Health Services 
for Students Act, and it is sponsored by 
Representatives 
NAPOLITANO
and 
KATKO. This bill authorizes the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration’s Project AWARE 
grants. 
Madam Speaker, these grants sup-
port State educational agencies, in 
partnership with State mental health 
agencies, in increasing awareness of 
mental health issues among school- 
aged youth, providing training for 
school personnel to detect and respond 
to mental health issues, and con-
necting 
students 
with 
behavioral 
health issues and their families to 
needed services. 
By supporting partnerships between 
the State and local systems to promote 
the healthy development of students, 
these grants increase access to mental 
health services for school-aged youth, 
ultimately reducing youth violence, 
substance use disorder, and suicide. 
I am glad we are addressing mental 
health services for children. Their 
schooling 
and 
whole 
worlds 
have 
changed so much over this year. It is 
important that they can easily access 
mental health services. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
I don’t believe we have any other 
speakers, Madam Speaker, so I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
b 1545 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge support for the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 1109, 
the Mental Health Services for Students Act. I 
am honored to have authored this bill for over 
a decade. Although it should not have taken 
this long, today is a historic day in recognizing 
the need for school based mental health re-
sources. 
A mental health crisis is currently unfolding 
as a result of the COVID–19 pandemic. Fear 
and anxiety about the coronavirus can be 
overwhelming and cause strong emotions for 
our constituents, especially children. The Na-
tional Institute of Mental Health reports that 
one in five youth already experience some 
type of mental health disorder. Yet, prior to 
this public health emergency, only 10 percent 
of children and adolescents ages 3 to 17 
years old received any treatment or coun-
seling from a mental health professional. 
H.R. 1109 acknowledges this problem by 
providing $130 million in competitive grants 
per year for 5 years for 100 school-based 
mental health programs nationwide. It expands 
the scope of the Project Advancing Wellness 
and Resilience Education (AWARE) program 
by providing on-site licensed mental health 
professionals in schools across the country. 
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the Na-
tional Institute of Allergy and Infectious Dis-
eases, testified in May before the Senate 
HELP Committee on the prospect of reopen-
ing school buildings and said, ‘‘We don’t know 
everything about this virus, and we really bet-
ter be very careful, particularly when it comes 
to children’’. While schools work to navigate 
this pandemic, it is critical that we provide 
them with the resources to create a mental 
health plan to reach their students during this 
stressful time. 
H.R. 1109 is based on the successful Youth 
Suicide Prevention Program that I helped es-
tablish with Pacific Clinics in Los Angeles 
County in 2001. Regular classes will eventu-
ally resume, and according to the CDC, chil-
dren may feel upset or have other strong emo-
tions after an emergency. How a child reacts 
can vary depending on their age, previous ex-
periences, and how that child typically copes 
with stress. We need to ensure the long-term 
availability of mental health services to ensure 
a bright future for our students, which my bill 
would help accomplish. 
I would like to thank the many advocates in 
and outside of Congress who have played an 
integral role in this legislation. H.R. 1109 has 
135 bipartisan co-sponsors and has the sup-
port of over 50 mental health organizations, as 
well as local governments and teacher unions. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support H.R. 1109, the Mental Health Services 
for Students Act, which will help address this 
ongoing children’s mental health crisis. It is 
now time to act on this bill, which has had 
broad support for decades. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1109, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH AC-
CESS 
FROM 
THE 
EMERGENCY 
DEPARTMENT ACT OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2519) to authorize the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services,

ter for Mental Health Services of the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services 
Administration,

proaches to securing prompt access to 
appropriate follow-on care for individ-
uals who experience an acute mental 
health episode and present for care in 
an emergency department, and for

‘‘SEC. 520J–1. SECURING APPROPRIATE FOLLOW- 
ON 
CARE

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 2519. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 2519, 
the Improving Mental Health Access 
from the Emergency Department Act 
of 2020. 
I thank Representative RAUL RUIZ, a 
member of our committee, and his staff 
for their work on this important legis-
lation. As an emergency room physi-
cian himself, Dr. RUIZ knows firsthand 
the needs of both the medical profes-
sional and the patients in the ER. 
One of these increasing needs is sup-
port for mental health services. Re-
search has shown that one in every 
eight emergency department visits in 
the U.S. is related to a mental health 
issue. Since 2009, mental health emer-
gency room visits have substantially 
increased, most of which were driven 
by adolescents and young adults. 
This is especially concerning, given 
recent data from the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention that found 
that, in 2019, more than one in seven 
Americans experienced some level of 
anxiety and nearly one in five reported 
depression. 
These studies were conducted before 
COVID–19, and we know that this pan-
demic is likely to have both long- and 
short-term implications for mental 
health, and this anticipated increase in 
need is reason to act now. H.R. 2519 
would help to provide increased access 
to care for people who report to the 
emergency department for acute men-
tal health episodes. 
Under the bill, the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services is author-
ized to award grants to support innova-
tive approaches for providing follow-on 
care for individuals treated in the 
emergency department for acute men-
tal health issues. This includes increas-
ing the number of inpatient psychiatric 
beds and alternative care settings, sup-
porting a patient’s transition to appro-
priate mental health services, or the 
use of telepsychiatric support or other 
remote psychiatric consultation meth-
ods. 
Madam Speaker, emergency depart-
ments can sometimes feel like a stress-
ful place, especially for people in crisis; 
however, they are often the last re-
maining safety net in many commu-
nities. We know that follow-up care for 
people with mental illness is linked to 
fewer repeat emergency room visits 
and improved mental and physical 
health. Let’s do our part to support the 
emergency room staff and patients in 
need. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 2519. This is 
the Improving Mental Health Access 
from the Emergency Department Act 
of 2020 sponsored by our colleague from 
California, Dr. RUIZ. 
The bill authorizes Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration award grants to emergency de-
partments for the purpose of sup-
porting follow-up services to patients 
who present in the emergency depart-
ment experiencing a mental health cri-
sis. 
Now, according to SAMHSA’s Na-
tional Guidelines for Behavioral Health 
Crisis Care, there is a disconnect in the 
provision of follow-up services regard-
ing what comes next for a patient expe-
riencing a mental health crisis in an 
emergency department. If a patient 
comes in with appendicitis, the emer-
gency physician can call a surgeon. If 
the patient has a rash, the emergency 
department has a roster of dermatolo-
gists and clinics, and, in many cases, 
the physician can even make an ap-
pointment for that patient.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5017 
September 29, 2020 
Sadly, tragically, these same part-
nerships don’t always exist if the pa-
tient has mental health issues. By au-
thorizing grants to support programs 
that help those treated at the emer-
gency department expeditiously transi-
tion to follow-up care, this bill would 
remove those barriers to care for those 
who experience an acute mental health 
crisis. And we think it will reduce the 
stigma, and, ultimately, it will save 
lives. 
I ask my colleagues to join us in sup-
porting this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t believe we 
have any other speakers on this legis-
lation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge support of the legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2519, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

EFFECTIVE 
SUICIDE 
SCREENING

sessment, and treatment of patients in 
the emergency department who are at 
risk of suicide, and for other purposes, 
as amended.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5018 
September 29, 2020 
year. Despite national efforts to lower 
the suicide rate, a number of reports 
show a steady increase in suicides in 
recent years. In fact, over the last two 
decades, the suicide rate in the U.S. in-
creased 35 percent. These are clearly 
alarming trends. 
Like other health crises, the emer-
gency room is often a place where peo-
ple at risk for suicide go for help. Data 
shows us that the risk of a suicide at-
tempt or a death is highest within 30 
days of discharge from an emergency 
department or inpatient psychiatric 
unit. 
Further, over a third of individuals 
without a diagnosis who died by suicide 
made an emergency room visit within a 
year of their death. That is why we 
have to act to equip our emergency 
rooms with better training and tools to 
screen and assess patients at risk for 
suicide. 
This bill would create a grant pro-
gram to help emergency departments 
develop policies and procedures for 
identifying and assessing people who 
are at risk of suicide and enhancing the 
coordination of care for them after dis-
charge. These improvements would be 
made possible by better training, shar-
ing of best practices, and hiring of be-
havioral health professionals in the 
emergency room who specialize in sui-
cidal ideation. 
This bill has support from the Amer-
ican Foundation for Suicide Preven-
tion, the American Association of 
Suicidology, and the American College 
of Emergency Physicians, groups that 
know these issues up close. 
I thank my colleagues, Representa-
tive ELIOT ENGEL, who is here, and also 
Representative GUS
BILIRAKIS. They 
led this important legislation to the 
floor. 
I also thank Ranking Member WAL-
DEN and all members and staff of our 
committee for their efforts to move the 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 4861. This is the 
Effective Suicide Screening and Assess-
ment in the Emergency Department 
Act that was introduced by Represent-
ative BILIRAKIS, whom we will hear 
from in a minute, and our friend Con-
gressman ENGEL. 
Before I talk about the legislation, I 
would say what a joy and privilege it 
has been to serve on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee with Mr. ENGEL. 
He is an incredible individual, cares 
deeply about his constituents, and 
works hard on their behalf. 
Moreover, Congressman ENGEL
has 
been one of those people who is always 
kind and thoughtful to all of us on both 
sides of the aisle and works to put the 
interests of Americans first, both on 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
and in his incredibly important and 
powerful role as chairman of the For-
eign Affairs Committee. 
Congressman 
ENGEL
has 
served 
America and New York well, and while 
we haven’t always agreed on every 
issue, we have never been disagreeable, 
and I wish him and his wife Godspeed 
in whatever is next in his career. 
This legislation would authorize a 
grant program to improve the identi-
fication, screening, assessment, and 
treatment of patients in emergency de-
partments who are at risk for suicide. 
Consideration of this bill could not 
come at a more pressing and important 
time. As we have said before on these 
matters, the COVID–19 pandemic and 
the resulting economic downturn have 
impacted the mental health and well- 
being of all Americans. In fact, a re-
cently released report by the Well 
Being Trust and the American Acad-
emy of Family Physicians predicts 
that, because of the pandemic, an addi-
tional 150,000 Americans could die of 
‘‘deaths from despair,’’ meaning deaths 
from suicide or drug or alcohol misuse. 
Emergency departments are key lo-
cations to intervene and assist those 
who may be contemplating taking 
their own lives. As past research iden-
tified, one in every eight emergency 
department visits in the U.S. was re-
lated to a mental health or substance 
use disorder. 
By creating grants for emergency de-
partments 
to 
develop 
policies 
for 
screening those at risk of suicide and 
enhancing their post-discharge care co-
ordination, this bill would improve our 
frontline healthcare providers’ ability 
to intervene when someone is in crisis, 
ultimately reducing deaths from de-
spair, especially during this difficult 
time. 
I would urge my colleagues to join 
the chairman of the committee and 
myself and our colleagues who put so 
much time and effort and work into 
crafting this legislation to support it, 
pass it, and let’s get it into law. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL). 
I do want to say I appreciate, again, 
Mr. WALDEN’s comments about the ex-
cellent career of Mr. ENGEL, but I am 
also not ready to say good-bye to ei-
ther Mr. ENGEL or Mr. WALDEN at this 
time because we are going to be here 
for a while the next few months. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 4861, the Effective 
Suicide Screening and Assessment in 
the Emergency Department Act. 
Before I tell why, I want to thank my 
good friend Mr. PALLONE from New Jer-
sey. We came to Congress together a 
long while ago, and we have worked 
very closely together. 
And I want to thank Mr. WALDEN. He 
said I am thoughtful. He is one of the 
most thoughtful Members in Congress. 
He reaches across the aisle, and we 
have made a lot of great progress, and 
the country is so much better having 
people with that kind of temperament 
to reach across the aisle. I thank the 
gentleman for all the kind words. They 
really mean a lot. 
I authored this legislation with my 
colleague, GUS BILIRAKIS, to help re-
duce rates of suicide in the United 
States. 
Suicide is the 10th leading cause of 
death in the U.S. It claimed more than 
47,000 lives in 2017, alone. 
b 1600 
According to the National Institute 
of Mental Health, the suicide rate in 
the U.S. increased by an alarming 31 
percent from 2001 to 2017. 
In this time of COVID, where the 
pandemic has taken an untold physical 
and 
emotional 
toll 
on 
Americans’ 
health, officials are reporting surges in 
mental and behavioral health prob-
lems. 
Studies show that as many as 11 per-
cent of all patients visiting a hospital 
emergency department are at risk for 
suicide, but only a fraction of these at- 
risk patients are ever identified. 
Our bill aims to improve the identi-
fication, assessment, and treatment of 
patients in emergency departments 
who are at high risk of suicide. 
It provides $100 million over a 5-year 
period to support emergency depart-
ment programs to prevent suicides spe-
cifically by: 
Training emergency department cli-
nicians to identify patients with an 
elevated risk of suicide; 
Developing programs to coordinate 
care and follow-up of those with an ele-
vated risk of suicide; 
Supporting 
the 
recruitment 
and 
retainment of behavioral health profes-
sionals who specialize in treating indi-
viduals with suicidal tendencies; and 
Incentivizing the development of new 
approaches, such as telehealth, to help 
those at high risk of suicide. 
Our legislation has been endorsed by 
over 40 mental health advocacy groups, 
including: the Emergency Nurses Asso-
ciation, the American Nurses Associa-
tion, the American Psychological Asso-
ciation, the American Psychiatric As-
sociation, The Kennedy Forum, the Na-
tional Alliance on Mental Illness, and 
Mental Health America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS), a real leader in the area of 
healthcare 
and 
especially 
mental 
health services improvement. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate the gentleman yielding. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4861, 
the Effective Suicide Screening and As-
sessment in the Emergency Depart-
ment Act. 
Our Nation remains in the midst of a 
suicide crisis, Mr. Speaker. Over the 
past several decades, the suicide rate 
has risen sharply, increasing by 31 per-
cent since 2001—this is unacceptable—

September 29, 2020 
making suicide the 10th leading cause 
of death and claiming an estimated 
47,000 lives annually. 
A 2016 study found that 11 percent of 
all emergency department patients ex-
hibited 
suicidal 
ideation. 
However, 
only 3 percent of those patients were 
diagnosed by current screening tools. 
Furthermore, about 70 percent of pa-
tients who leave the emergency depart-
ment after a suicide attempt never at-
tend their first outpatient follow-up 
appointment. 
At the same time, emergency depart-
ments, which are often the place with-
in our healthcare system that provides 
care for people who are at risk for sui-
cide, have inconsistent protocols for 
screening and treating high-risk pa-
tients. 
For this reason, I introduced with my 
friend and colleague, a true statesman, 
Congressman ENGEL, the Effective Sui-
cide Screening and Assessment in the 
Emergency Department Act. 
The bill creates a voluntary HHS pro-
gram to assist emergency departments 
in developing protocols for identifying, 
assessing, and treating individuals at 
risk for suicide, with preference given 
to either critical access hospitals or 
hospitals located in a geographic area 
with a suicide risk that is higher than 
the national rate. 
Grants last for 2 years, and grantees 
must submit a report annually on their 
efforts to improve the identification, 
assessment, and discharge policies for 
individuals who are at risk for suicide. 
This proactive approach is very vital, 
because emergency departments are 
often, again, the first and, sadly, too 
often, the only point of contact within 
the healthcare system for those most 
at risk for suicide, like individuals liv-
ing with severe mental health condi-
tions or substance use disorders. 
With the added physical, mental, 
emotional, and economic stress this 
pandemic has inflicted on American 
lives, there is growing data and a con-
sensus of concern from public health 
experts and stakeholders that these 
stressors could lead to even more lives 
lost to suicide. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
pass the Effective Suicide Screening 
and Assessment in the Emergency De-
partment Act to further equip our 
health providers to recognize and assist 
these patients in crisis. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
other speakers on our side of the aisle, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for the bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, H.R. 4861, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5020 
September 29, 2020 
under section 520A of the Public Health Service 
Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb–32) that are submitted after 
the date of enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7293. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 7293, 
the Suicide Training and Awareness 
Nationally Delivered for Universal Pre-
vention Act of 2020, or the STANDUP 
Act. 
As we have heard, suicide is the 10th 
leading cause of death in the U.S. How-
ever, it is the second leading cause of 
death for young Americans age 10 to 14, 
which has tripled since 2007. 
Unfortunately, the COVID–19 pan-
demic is already exacerbating these 
trends. Sandy Hook Promise’s 24/7 cri-
sis center, which allows people to iden-
tify and help at-risk students, has seen 
a more than 10 percent increase in sui-
cide tips thus far. 
During our hearing on this bill, 
Arriana Gross, a high school student 
from 
Covington, 
Georgia, 
testified 
that: ‘‘In our school, a year doesn’t go 
by without a student dying by suicide. 
I’ve even known of elementary kids 
who died by suicide. I am concerned 
that youth suicide has become so com-
mon that my school community and 
our Nation is stuck in a pattern of 
mourning and accepting these deaths 
as something that is normal, instead of 
seeing them as preventable and trag-
ic.’’ 
Again, Mr. Speaker, those are the 
words of Arriana Gross, a high school 
student. 
Like Arriana, I am concerned. 
Despite data that suicide is on the 
rise, we can act now to help equip stu-
dents and the communities around 
them to identify risk factors so they 
can play an active role in preventing 
suicide or self-harm. 
Now, this bill, H.R. 7293, would en-
courage schools to expand evidence- 
based suicide prevention training to 
students and make public best prac-
tices for such training as a condition of 
receiving funds under the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration Project AWARE grant 
program. 
The STANDUP Act would also sup-
port technical assistance resources for 
schools and encourage the collection 
and reporting of data to track imple-
mentation of these policies and prac-
tices. 
Research, Mr. Speaker, shows that 
training students on suicide prevention 
makes an impact on student suicide 
rates and improves the students’ will-
ingness to seek help or to help a peer. 
Much of this training is already tak-
ing place across thousands of schools 
nationwide, but the STANDUP Act will 
help ensure that this good work is ex-
panded to more schools across the 
country. 
So for these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I 
stand up in support of the STANDUP 
Act. This is good, bipartisan legisla-
tion. I thank the lead sponsors, Rep-
resentatives SCOTT PETERS, GUS BILI-
RAKIS, TED DEUTCH, BRIAN FITZPATRICK, 
and their staffs for their work on this 
critical issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank Mr. WAL-
DEN and the committee staff for work-
ing with us on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7293, the Suicide Training and 
Awareness Nationally Delivered for 
Universal Prevention, or STANDUP, 
Act of 2020. It was introduced by our 
Energy and Commerce Committee col-
leagues, Representative PETERS, who I 
know we are going to hear from soon, 
and Representative BILIRAKIS, who we 
are also going to hear from. 
This legislation addresses a key 
measure in promoting suicide aware-
ness and prevention training among 
students and young Americans. 
Sadly, for the last decade, suicide has 
been the second leading cause of death 
for Americans ages 10 to 24 and the 10th 
leading cause of overall deaths in the 
United States. 
Tragically, this epidemic has only 
worsened during the COVID–19 epi-
demic. 
Suicide is preventable, and initia-
tives 
that 
empower 
students 
with 
knowledge of the warning signs and re-
sources for prevention are critical in 
addressing these trends. 
We believe, through this legislation, 
Project AWARE grantees would be em-
powered to establish school-based sui-
cide awareness and prevention training 
programs, which will improve student 
awareness of mental health issues 
while connecting at-risk individuals to 
needed health services. 
So as we approach the end of Sep-
tember, our nationally recognized Sui-
cide Prevention Awareness Month, it is 
critical that we continue addressing 
our Nation’s challenges in preventing 
youth suicide and promoting the men-
tal health and wellness of all. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
PETERS). 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and the 
chairman for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, last year, I visited 
Bernardo Heights Middle School in 
Rancho Bernardo to meet with stu-
dents of the school’s SAVE Promise 
Club and the Mental Health Awareness 
Club. 
The kids told me about their efforts 
to make their peers feel more accepted 
by creating a culture of kindness and 
by using their voices to end the stigma 
surrounding mental health. They ex-
plained their work with programs in-
tended to promote inclusivity and to 
prevent violence by teaching children 
and adults to identify, intervene, and 
help those at risk of harming them-
selves or others. 
According to the National Institute 
of Mental Health, suicide is the second 
leading cause of death by those 10 to 24 
years old, with cases of suicide among 
Black and other minority youth rap-
idly rising. 
The good news is that adolescent sui-
cide and violence can be prevented if 
others heed the warning signs. 
Seventy percent of those who die by 
suicide tell someone their plans or 
demonstrate warning signs ahead of 
time. Eighty percent of school shooters 
tell someone their plans ahead of time. 
That is why I teamed up with my 
friend from Florida, Mr. GUS BILIRAKIS, 
to introduce the bipartisan STANDUP 
Act. 
The Act requires States, schools, and 
Tribes to implement evidence-based 
policies to prevent suicides in order to 
receive Project AWARE grants, which 
boost youth mental health awareness 
among schools and communities. 
These policies are key to preventing 
school violence by encouraging early 
prevention, teaching warning signs, 
and providing schools with crucial 
tools to help stop violence before it 
happens. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Sandy Hook 
Promise, who helped champion this 
bill, and for hosting my visit at 
Bernardo Heights Middle School. Along 
with them, over 50 student and mental 
health-focused organizations support 
this legislation. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
all 
the 
Bernardo Heights Bobcats, who care so 
well for each other’s mental health. We 
want to bring that same spirit, their 
same spirit, to every school in the 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
pass the STANDUP Act to protect our 
students and enhance school safety. 
Go Bobcats. 
b 1615 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS). 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the ranking member and the 
chairman for all of their good work 
and, of course, Congressman PETERS. 
This is a great committee, and we get 
things done, that is for sure. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7293, the Suicide Training and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5021 
September 29, 2020 
Awareness Nationally Delivered for 
Universal 
Prevention 
Act, 
or 
the 
STAND-UP Act. 
There is no higher priority than 
keeping our children safe. I think ev-
eryone agrees with that. Since 2010, 
suicide has been the second-leading 
cause of death for young Americans 
ages 10–24, unfortunately. 
From 2007 to 2015, the number of chil-
dren and teens visiting emergency 
rooms for suicide-related injuries dou-
bled. In 2017, 517 Americans aged 10–14, 
and 6,252 aged 15–24, committed suicide. 
Sadly, some communities in my dis-
trict are among those with the highest 
suicide rates in Florida. 
Research has shown that most of 
these young Americans tell someone 
that they are contemplating suicide or 
school violence, and 68 percent of 
averted violence was stopped because 
of a student reporting concerns about a 
threat, plot, or other concerning be-
havior involving a peer. 
The 
STAND-UP 
Act 
encourages 
States, Tribes, and schools to create 
policies for student suicide prevention 
training using SAMHSA-provided best 
practices, training, and technical as-
sistance. 
By providing high-quality screening 
and prevention training to school staff 
and peers, threats can be identified be-
fore they materialize, and those who 
are at risk have an opportunity to get 
the mental health treatment they need 
and deserve. 
I have seen firsthand the power of 
this 
particular 
program 
through, 
again, nonprofits, like Sandy Hook 
Promise. They have been very instru-
mental in getting this bill done, with 
their SAVE Promise Club. 
My kids have gone to Palm Harbor 
University. I still have one there, and 
that is in my district. Mr. Speaker, 
when properly equipped, students can 
be empowered to prevent violence in 
their schools, and I have witnessed the 
great work that they do in that par-
ticular school. 
I appreciate the bipartisan work of 
my 
colleague, 
again, 
Congressman 
PETERS, and I urge my colleagues to 
join us in passing this critical piece of 
legislation to reverse the troubling 
trend of youth suicide and violence. 
We have to get this through the Sen-
ate as well and to the President’s desk, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
other speakers on my side of the aisle 
on this legislation. I urge its passage, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge passage of the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7293, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION 
GUIDELINES ACT OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3539) to amend the Public Health 
Service Act to direct the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to develop 
best practices for the establishment 
and use of behavioral intervention 
teams at schools, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3539 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

September 29, 2020 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 3539, 
the Behavioral Intervention Guidelines 
Act of 2020. The champions of this leg-
islation, Representatives DREW
FER-
GUSON, MICHAEL
BURGESS, JOE
KEN-
NEDY, and JIMMY PANETTA, worked to-
gether to help provide improved behav-
ioral health prevention tools to schools 
and colleges across the country, and I 
applaud them for their bipartisan ef-
forts. 
Behavioral intervention teams are 
multidisciplinary teams that support 
students’ mental health and emotional 
well-being 
by 
detecting 
patterns, 
trends, and disturbances in behavior, 
and by conducting outreach to stu-
dents who are unable to manage dis-
tress in healthy and constructive ways. 
These teams are already active in 
some educational settings, such as the 
University of California, Los Angeles; 
Texas A&M University; and Virginia 
Tech. 
H.R. 3539 requires the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration to develop best practices 
for schools that have or want to have 
behavioral intervention teams. These 
best practices would cover the proper 
use of these teams and how to inter-
vene and avoid inappropriate use of 
mental health assessments and law en-
forcement. 
These best practices would then be 
required to be posted publicly on the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services website, and HHS would help 
to provide technical assistance to enti-
ties implementing these best practices. 
As we have heard, Mr. Speaker, three 
in four children aged 3–17 with depres-
sion also have anxiety. Anxiety and de-
pression are two top mental health 
concerns among college students as 
well. Unfortunately, recent data found 
that over 80 percent of young people 
with mental health needs did not re-
ceive the care they needed. 
Young people in crisis should be able 
to access the care they need or be able 
to find support from peers who can di-
rect them toward appropriate services, 
and this bill helps bridge that gap. 
Again, I want to thank the Demo-
crats and Republicans on my com-
mittee, including Ranking Member 
WALDEN, for working together to put 
this legislation in shape, and I urge my 
colleagues to support the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 3539, the Behavioral 
Intervention 
Guidelines 
Act, 
intro-
duced by Representatives FERGUSON, 
BURGESS, KENNEDY, and PANETTA. 
This important bill authorizes the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration to develop 
best practices for establishing and 
using behavioral intervention teams in 
elementary schools, secondary schools, 
and institutions of higher education. 
Behavioral intervention teams are 
multidisciplinary teams that support 
students’ mental health and wellness 
by identifying students experiencing 
stress, anxiety, or other behavioral dis-
turbances, and conducting intervention 
and outreach to these students to help 
manage risk. These teams are already 
active in some educational institutions 
such as Texas Tech University and the 
University of California, Los Angeles. 
By acting in a proactive manner to 
assist students and to connect them 
with 
needed 
resources, 
behavioral 
intervention teams help schools create 
a safe environment for their students 
and improve mental health outcomes 
in young people. 
I urge support of this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON), the deputy 
whip of the House on the Republican 
side of the aisle, one of the authors of 
this important legislation. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the chairman and 
the ranking member for this oppor-
tunity, and I rise to support H.R. 3539. 
Every American wants to live in a 
safe community, and children deserve 
to be able to go to safe schools. But all 
too often, that safety has been ruined 
by violence to self or others. 
The Behavioral Intervention Guide-
lines, or BIG, Act combats this mental 
health epidemic head-on by providing 
local communities and school systems 
with the tools they need to help iden-
tify those most in need. 
All across the country, schools like 
Columbus State University in my home 
State of Georgia and Texas Tech in 
Lubbock, Texas, have implemented be-
havioral intervention programs fol-
lowing the 2008 tragedy at Virginia 
Tech. 
Dr. Chip Reese at Columbus State 
University and other university lead-
ers, like Dr. Billy Phillips at Texas 
Tech, report that, as a result of these 
programs, they have seen universities’ 
culture change and are helping to get 
at-risk students back on the right 
track. 
This important legislation would fos-
ter this approach by providing Federal 
guidance in the form of best practices. 
Once established, these best practices 
will be disseminated on the HHS 
website, and HHS would provide tech-
nical assistance for elementary, sec-
ondary, and higher education institu-
tions that are looking to create their 
own behavioral health intervention 
teams. 
Now more than ever, our students 
should have the proper resources and a 
supportive community around them to 
benefit their mental health. I strongly 
urge my colleagues to support this im-
portant piece of legislation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank my colleague for his work on 
this important legislation. 
I want to turn now and use the re-
mainder of the time to recognize the 
fact that we all work hard on our legis-
lation, but it doesn’t get all the way 
here and all the way through without 
terrific staff. We are blessed on the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee by hav-
ing really terrific staff, from top to 
bottom. 
But today, I especially want to recog-
nize and thank Mike Bloomquist, my 
staff director at the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. He has served as 
staff director of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee Republicans both 
during the 115th Congress and the 116th 
Congress. 
He previously served as committee 
deputy staff director, general counsel, 
deputy general counsel, and then as 
general counsel to the 2011 Joint Select 
Committee on Deficit Reduction. He 
has spent time in private law practice, 
at the Committee on Science, and in 
the Office of the Solicitor at the U.S. 
Department of the Interior. 
He has been an invaluable leader of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
staff. He is a trusted counselor. He is a 
sought-after mentor and a go-to re-
source for staff and Members alike, 
both on and off the committee. 
He will be leaving us at the end of 
this month to pursue private-sector en-
deavors. But I just want to say, he has 
been a real friend to me, a real coun-
selor to me, and an incredibly solid 
leader for our team. He has helped us 
shepherd major legislation through the 
House, which has undoubtedly im-
proved the lives of Americans, through 
his time as a public servant. 
I think we all wish him the very best 
in his new endeavor and are thankful 
to his wife, Christie, and their three 
daughters for lending us their dad so 
often on nights and weekends and for 
phone calls, text messages, and more 
phone calls from me, day and night. 
He has just been terrific to work 
with. We wish him Godspeed in his next 
endeavor. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I don’t have any additional speakers, 
but I do want also to praise Mike 
Bloomquist. 
He is now the Republican staff direc-
tor, but he has had several tours with 
the committee. He worked on some 
major legislation in the committee. I 
think of 21st Century Cures, robocalls, 
and, even today, getting the cyber bills 
passed, which was not an easy task, as 
you know, Mike. 
I know that our Ranking Member 
WALDEN mentioned your family. I don’t 
know how your family puts up with 
any of the things we do because I know 
the many hours that you have to 
spend. So, again, thank your family for 
sharing you. 
I wish you well in your future en-
deavors as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I would just conclude my remarks by, 
again, speaking in favor of the under-
lying legislation, but also thanking 
Mike and his team for doing such a 
great job throughout this Congress and 
the preceding one to help all of us come 
together and solve the Nation’s prob-
lems to the best of our ability. They 
really are a talented team, and we have 
been fortunate to have Mike at the 
helm. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3539, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CREATING HOPE 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4439) to amend the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make per-
manent the authority of the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services to issue 
priority review vouchers to encourage 
treatments for rare pediatric diseases, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4439 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Creating 
Hope Reauthorization Act’’. 
SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY TO ISSUE PRI-
ORITY REVIEW VOUCHERS TO EN-
COURAGE TREATMENTS FOR RARE 
PEDIATRIC DISEASES. 
Section 529(b)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360ff(b)(5)) is 
amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘December 11, 2020’’ each 
place it appears and inserting ‘‘September 30, 
2024’’; and 
(2) in subparagraph (B), by striking ‘‘De-
cember 11, 2022’’ and inserting ‘‘September 
30, 2026’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4439. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4439 would extend 
the pediatric rare disease priority re-
view voucher program at the Food and 
Drug Administration. This priority re-
view voucher, or PRV, was originally 
created in 2012 with the intent to cre-
ate an incentive for drug manufactur-
ers to develop therapies for rare pedi-
atric diseases that affect neonates, in-
fants, children, and adolescents. 
The program requires FDA to award 
a PRV to the sponsor of an application 
that receives approval as a drug or bio-
logic to treat a rare pediatric disease. 
Since the program’s creation, 22 of 
these PRVs have been awarded, with 
five awards in 2019. 
Now, I have long been a supporter of 
increased research and development of 
treatments for rare diseases, and I am 
proud that our committee was able to 
come to consensus on a reasonable ex-
tension of this program. Nevertheless, 
some observers of this program have 
shown our committee evidence that the 
PRV program has not provided the in-
centive value intended by Congress 
when it was first enacted. 
This 
program 
was 
supposed 
to 
incentivize new development of pedi-
atric products that would not other-
wise have occurred. However, the Gov-
ernment 
Accountability 
Office 
re-
viewed the program and concluded that 
the agency could not find definitive 
evidence 
that 
the 
program 
is 
incentivizing pediatric drug develop-
ment. Additionally, FDA has said that 
PRVs drain agency resources away 
from the agency’s public health mis-
sion and have a negative impact on the 
morale of agency staff. 
For these reasons, I could not sup-
port a permanent reauthorization of 
the program. But I recognize that 
many pharmaceutical developers have 
argued that the PRV provides an incen-
tive for drug development, with one 
going so far as to say that the PRV was 
a pivotal consideration for making in-
vestments. I worked with Representa-
tives BUTTERFIELD, the bill’s sponsor, 
and Ranking Member WALDEN, as well, 
to support a reauthorization of the pro-
gram for 4 years. 
Mr. Speaker, the Energy and Com-
merce Committee will continue to pro-
vide oversight to examine the effec-
tiveness of this program and its effect 
on FDA resources. The committee will 
also carefully scrutinize it with hopes 
that it serves its intended purpose and 
leads to new treatments and cures for 
rare pediatric diseases. 
With this hope, Mr. Speaker, I ask 
Members to support this bipartisan 
bill. I urge the Senate to swiftly take 
action on H.R. 4439, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4439, the Creating Hope Reau-
thorization Act, introduced by our col-
leagues, Representative BUTTERFIELD 
and Representative MCCAUL. This bill 
extends the pediatric priority review 
voucher program for an additional 4 
years. 
This program, which has had bipar-
tisan support since it was first created 
in 2012 with the passage of the Food 
and Drug Administration Safety and 
Innovation Act, aims to incentivize the 
development of therapies to treat rare 
pediatric diseases. 
The pediatric PRV program has al-
ready proven successful in encouraging 
innovation. In fact, 22 therapies have 
been approved for the treatment of 18 
rare pediatric diseases since its incep-
tion. However, we still have a long way 
to go. Nearly 95 percent of all rare dis-
eases do not have an FDA-approved 
treatment, leaving many patients with 
no options. 
This long-term reauthorization of the 
program will provide certainty to those 
currently developing or considering in-
vestment in innovative therapies to 
treat rare pediatric diseases. 
Bipartisan bills that encourage bio-
medical innovation like the one we are 
considering today mean continued hope 
for children and their families that, 
one day, there will be a treatment and 
that there will be a cure. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. I have no additional 
speakers, and I reserve the balance of 
my time, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS). 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 4439, the Cre-
ating Hope Reauthorization Act. 
Tragically, pediatric cancer remains 
the number one disease that leads to 
the death of American children. While 
survival rates have improved for some 
types of pediatric cancers, thousands of 
children are lost to cancer each year, 
and many more encounter life-threat-
ening complications relating to harsh 
chemotherapies. 
Children have significantly fewer 
treatment options than adults, Mr. 
Speaker, and oftentimes must rely on 
treatment 
regimens 
developed 
for 
adults because pediatric-specific treat-
ments simply do not exist. Unfortu-
nately, as the popular healthcare adage 
goes, children are not little adults. 
Despite their significant need, phar-
maceutical companies have had trouble 
developing treatments for pediatric 
cancer and rare diseases because of the 
small population and high cost of 
bringing these specific treatments to 
market. 
FDA’s priority review voucher pro-
gram has proven to be a boon to 
incentivizing the development of thera-
pies to treat rare pediatric diseases. 
While progress has been made in the 
development of pediatric therapies—in 
fact, 22 therapies have been approved

for the treatment of 18 rare pediatric 
diseases since 2012, which is really 
great—there is still more work to be 
done however. Nearly 95 percent of all 
rare diseases do not have an FDA-ap-
proved treatment, leaving many pa-
tients without options. 
As co-chair of the Rare Disease Cau-
cus, I sincerely appreciate the good 
work from Ranking Member MCCAUL, 
of course, the ranking member of the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
and the chairman of the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce for bringing this 
bill forward, and also Congressman 
BUTTERFIELD. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join us in passing the Cre-
ating Hope Reauthorization Act, which 
will extend this vital innovation life-
line for rare pediatric treatments and 
cures at FDA. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), 
who is a serious leader on this issue 
and has been for a long time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, let me 
thank the ranking member, Mr. WAL-
DEN, from Oregon for his steadfast sup-
port on this issue. I want to thank the 
chairman for getting to this point 
where we are back on the floor, and the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, in 
general, for its support of this bill 4 
years ago and, now, a 4-year reauthor-
ization. 
As the founder and co-chair of the 
Childhood Cancer Caucus, I have met 
with countless cancer patients and ad-
vocates who have asked me for one 
thing: hope. They want meaningful 
hope, something realistic and some-
thing tangible, better cures, safer 
treatment, and more research dollars. 
So, alongside my colleagues, Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD, Mr. KELLY, and Ms. 
SPEIER, we have used the Childhood 
Cancer Caucus to produce that hope. 
This caucus has yielded tangible re-
sults for the hundreds of thousands of 
patients, advocates, and parents who 
were just hoping for better results. 
When we first started this caucus 
over a decade ago, there were only two 
new drugs developed to specifically 
treat pediatric cancer in the prior 20 
years. I would talk to these children 
and their parents, and they would tell 
me that the cancer just had no treat-
ment, or if there was a treatment, it 
was of a drug developed in the 1960s or 
older. 
Many of these drugs were meant to 
be used by adults, and their intent was 
to kill the cancer before it killed the 
person. That is why Mr. BUTTERFIELD 
and I worked together to pass the 
original Creating Hope Act in 2011, to 
try to create a market to get more pe-
diatric cancer and rare disease drugs 
approved in this country. 
Specifically, our bill created a vouch-
er award within the FDA where compa-
nies that developed rare pediatric dis-
ease drugs have priority on future 
products that could save kids’ lives. 
I am happy to report that this pro-
gram has been very successful. Since 
2014 when the first voucher was issued, 
22 new drugs for rare diseases in kids 
have been approved by the FDA, in-
cluding two drugs for childhood can-
cers, with more expected on the way. 
I have seen, firsthand, the wonders of 
this program. 
In September of 2013, a constituent of 
mine named Rex Ryan was diagnosed 
with stage 4 neuroblastoma at just 18 
months old. After exhausting all op-
tions, Rex was blessed to have received 
a novel new drug that was developed 
and approved in part because of the in-
centive of the Creating Hope Act. Rex 
is now cancer free and a healthy third 
grader saved by the drug developed be-
cause of this program. 
It is for Rex and all the other chil-
dren who have been saved because of 
this program and will be saved because 
of this program that I stand here today 
in support of the bill. 
I think, most remarkably, of a dear 
friend of mine, Dr. Allison from MD 
Anderson Cancer Center, who had a 
childhood cancer clinical trial going 
and was able to use the voucher pro-
gram to obtain FDA approval for a 
treatment now called immunotherapy. 
Immunotherapy is a breakthrough in 
cancer treatment not just for children 
but for all adults. He got the Nobel 
Prize in medicine for it. 
While this bill before us today reau-
thorizes the program for another 4 
years, I would hope to see, when we 
come back again, that this program 
will be made permanent. So I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues in 
the Congress to achieve that goal. 
I appreciate the support from the ad-
vocates and members of my team, espe-
cially my outgoing legislative director, 
THOMAS
RICE, who spent countless 
hours meeting with the advocates, the 
brains behind the operation, and Nancy 
Goodman, who gave us all these great 
ideas to develop four major pieces of 
legislation. 
I 
can’t 
thank 
THOMAS 
enough for all his great work. 
Together, we can and will defeat 
childhood cancer. It is vital that we 
keep this program alive so that we 
keep hope alive for the hundreds of 
thousands of children and their fami-
lies who are waiting for the big break 
of a treatment. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my colleague from Texas for his 
great leadership on this issue. I encour-
age our colleagues to vote for this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge support for the legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 4439, the ‘‘Creating Hope 
Reauthorization Act,’’ which amends the Fed-
eral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make 
permanent the authority of the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to issue priority 
review vouchers to encourage treatments for 
rare pediatric diseases. 
Under Section 529 to the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), FDA will 
award priority review vouchers to sponsors of 
rare pediatric disease product applications that 
meet certain criteria. 
By definition, rare diseases do not affect 
much of the population, so there is little finan-
cial gain for pharmaceutical companies. 
The U.S. government has created the Or-
phan Drug Act and the rare pediatric disease 
priority review voucher programs to add finan-
cial incentives for development of medicines, 
which is making the development of drugs for 
rare diseases more common. 
However, many of the drugs for rare dis-
eases are approved for adults. 
Physicians sometimes have no choice but to 
prescribe offlabel use of such drugs for chil-
dren. 
Drugs for rare diseases, whether approved 
for pediatric patients or being used off label, 
often come in formats that are inappropriate 
for children. 
Most young children have trouble swal-
lowing tablets or capsules, and many children 
are sensitive to bitter-tasting drugs. 
Sometimes, however, such formats are all 
that is available, which can lead to difficulty in 
effectively treating young patients. 
This is why H.R. 4439, the ‘‘Creating Hope 
Reauthorization Act’’ is needed. 
Under this program reinstated by this bill, a 
sponsor who receives an approval for a drug 
or biologic for a ‘‘rare pediatric disease’’ may 
qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to 
receive a priority review of a subsequent mar-
keting application for a different product. 
Without the passage of this bill, according to 
the current statutory sunset provisions for the 
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Vouch-
er Program, after September 30, 2020, which 
means the FDA may only award a voucher for 
an approved rare pediatric disease product 
application if the sponsor has rare pediatric 
disease designation for the drug, and that des-
ignation was granted by September 30, 2020. 
Further, without this bill after September 30, 
2022, FDA may not award any rare pediatric 
disease priority review vouchers. 
Enactment of this bill will mean that re-
quests for rare pediatric disease designation 
submitted within two weeks of a request for 
fast track designation or orphan drug designa-
tion are entitled to a 60-day review. 
Requests for rare pediatric disease designa-
tion not submitted with a request for fast track 
designation or orphan drug designation are re-
viewed in a timely manner, however, the 60- 
day response time does not apply. 
It is important for us to act today, because 
Friday, July 31, 2020, is the last business day 
that is not less than 60 days prior to Sep-
tember 30, 2020. 
The Offices of Orphan Products Develop-
ment and Pediatric. Therapeutics will continue 
to review all rare pediatric disease designation 
requests, but they cannot commit to providing 
a response to requests received after July 31, 
2020. 
Pediatric rare diseases have received in-
creased attention in recent years due to great-
er public awareness, significantly improved un-
derstanding and treatment. 
Rare diseases can be difficult to diagnose in 
children, and many physicians do not have the 
proper training and knowledge to diagnose 
such diseases. 
According to a 2014 Medscape Multispe-
cialty article, the average patient with a rare 
disease sees 7.3 physicians before diagnosis,

and 70 percent of physicians believe addi-
tional training in rare diseases would be help-
ful. 
A rare disease can spread and worsen dur-
ing the lengthy time before diagnosis and the 
start of the proper treatment. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting 
this bill. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 4439, the Creating Hope Reau-
thorization Act. I’m proud to have advanced 
this bipartisan bill through my Health Sub-
committee and I’m pleased to support it on the 
Floor today. 
The Creating Hope Reauthorization Act 
sponsored 
by 
Representative 
G.K. 
BUTTERFIELD helps children access pediatric 
cancer drugs. 
Pediatric cancer is the number one disease 
killer of American children, but pharmaceutical 
companies often avoid developing pediatric 
cancer drugs because of the small market and 
the high risks associated with studying and 
testing drugs for children. 
The Creating Hope Reauthorization Act pro-
vides incentives for the research and develop-
ment of pediatric cancer drugs by providing 
the developers with the valuable Priority Re-
view Vouchers which allow the recipient to 
speed up the FDA review of any one of its 
new drug products. 
Since its passage the GAO studied the pe-
diatric priority review vouchers and found that 
pharmaceutical developers said Priority Re-
view Vouchers were a factor in drug develop-
ment decisions. 
Dr. Crystal Mackall of the Stanford Center 
for Cancer Cell Therapy said that, ‘‘The 
voucher 
program 
has 
been 
remarkedly 
impactful for childhood cancers. Before the 
program, I used to go with my hat in hand to 
beg investors to consider a potential drug. 
Now people take a second look and are inter-
ested in developing drugs. We’re just getting 
started on this new way of thinking about chil-
dren’s drugs. The voucher program required a 
culture change around how to think of the pe-
diatric drug business model, which in the drug 
development world could take a while.’’ 
As Dr. Mackall said, this program seeks to 
shift decision-making early in the lengthy drug 
development cycle. A lengthy reauthorization 
of 4 years as offered in the AINS will be bene-
ficial for this decision-making and I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4439, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend the Fed-
eral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to 
extend the authority of the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services to issue 
priority review vouchers to encourage

for

GRID SECURITY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ACT 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5760) to provide for a comprehen-
sive interdisciplinary research, devel-
opment, and demonstration initiative 
to strengthen the capacity of the en-
ergy sector to prepare for and with-
stand cyber and physical attacks, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5760 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Grid Security 
Research and Development Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The Nation, and every critical infrastruc-
ture sector, depends on reliable electricity. 
(2) Intelligent electronic devices, advanced 
analytics, and information systems used across 
the energy sector are essential to maintaining 
reliable operation of the electric grid. 
(3) The cybersecurity threat landscape is con-
stantly changing and attacker capabilities are 
advancing rapidly, requiring ongoing modifica-
tions, advancements, and investments in tech-
nologies and procedures to maintain security. 
(4) It is in the national interest for Federal 
agencies to invest in cybersecurity research that 
informs and facilitates private sector investment 
and use of advanced cybersecurity tools and 
procedures to protect information systems. 
(5) The number of devices and systems con-
necting to the electric grid is increasing, and in-
tegrating cybersecurity protections into informa-
tion systems when they are built is more effec-
tive than modifying products after installation 
to meet cybersecurity goals. 
(6) An understanding of human factors can be 
leveraged to understand the behavior of cyber 
threat actors, develop strategies to counter 
threat actors, improve cybersecurity training 
programs, optimize the design of human-ma-
chine interfaces and cybersecurity tools, and in-
crease the capacity of the energy sector work-
force to prevent unauthorized access to critical 
systems.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and to include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 5760, the bill 
now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bill, H.R. 5760, the Grid Security 
Research and Development Act. 
I first want to thank the chairwoman 
of the Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology, Ms. JOHNSON, and the 
ranking member, Mr. LUCAS, for their 
help in passing the Grid Security R&D 
bill out of the Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology and bringing it 
to the floor. 
I also thank my colleague, Congress-
man RANDY
WEBER
from Texas, for 
joining on as a bipartisan cosponsor. 
Mr. Speaker, the Grid Security R&D 
Act 
supports 
sustained 
investment 
across Federal agencies in research and 
technology to keep pace with the rap-
idly evolving threats to our electrical 
grid. The bill focuses on protecting our 
grid from two major threats: Cyber and 
physical. 
Access to reliable power is core to 
our economy, and the impact of phys-
ical threats to our electric grid have 
never been clearer than now. 
This summer, in my home State of 
California, the scenario of high winds, 
combined with lightning strikes and 
dry ground, have created some of the 
most dangerous wildfires in our State’s 
history. In addition to burning millions 
of acres and causing loss of life, these 
wildfires put a significant part of our 
region on notice for potential emer-
gency power shutoffs to reduce the risk 
of new outbreaks and further wildfire 
damage. 
However, these shutoffs are not as 
simple as turning off and on a light 
switch. It takes time to de-energize 
transmission systems in advance of a 
severe weather event and to reenergize 
the system after the threat has passed. 
While safety and preventing wildfires 
is a high priority, these shutoffs can 
leave hundreds of thousands of people 
without power for a few days. Dan-
gerous wildfires, intense periods of 
drought, and other severe weather 
events have become increasingly more 
common in recent years because of cli-
mate change and will continue to 
threaten our grid. 
Furthermore, the inability to protect 
our grid from these severe weather 
events becomes more magnified during 
significant 
emergencies 
like 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Our hospitals and emergency rooms 
are working around the clock to save 
lives. They need access to reliable 
power and the assurance to know that 
the power will not go out during an im-
portant surgery or stop a ventilator 
from running. 
In addition, food banks and res-
taurants rely on refrigeration to con-
tinue supplying food to those in need 
and our small businesses cannot reopen 
if they can’t keep the lights on. 
Ensuring access to electricity is crit-
ical in times like this. That is why I 
am proud to lead this bill, which would 
help strengthen the resiliency of our 
electric grid against physical threats. 
Our bill would also provide funding to 
develop technologies that would tough-
en our grid against wildfires and other 
natural disasters by improving early 
detection of deteriorating electrical 
transmission and distribution systems.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5029 
September 29, 2020 
This aging equipment can tend to 
spark and come in contact with vegeta-
tion during high-wind events and nat-
ural disasters causing wildfires. 
This bill will also spur the develop-
ment and implementation of microgrid 
and battery storage technologies, pro-
vide backup power options so that in 
the event of an emergency power shut-
off, a more targeted shutoff will impact 
less households. 
The threat of climate change in our 
electric grid is real. We have an oppor-
tunity to continue the modernization 
of our power system infrastructure, 
and this bill is a step in the right direc-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, the other focus of our 
bill is improving cybersecurity across 
our electric grid. As the grid and other 
forms of critical infrastructure become 
more 
digitized, 
the 
risk 
that 
cyberattacks would shut down critical 
systems has increased, and in some 
cases these attacks can even cause 
physical damage to the grid. The types 
of cyberattacks also continue to be-
come more sophisticated. 
Last year, cyber hackers remotely 
attacked electric grid networks for the 
first time, affecting several Western 
States, including California, Utah, and 
Wyoming. Given how critical reliable 
access to power is to our daily lives, 
these attacks highlight the need for in-
vestment to address this evolving 
threat. 
H.R. 5760 would authorize a com-
prehensive, coordinated research effort 
across Federal agencies to advance cy-
bersecurity capabilities for the energy 
sector. 
Research areas would include: im-
proving rapid detection of cyber intru-
sions, integrating cybersecurity fea-
tures into the energy infrastructure, 
and focusing in on cyber solutions 
through our defense sector that can be 
modified and transferred to the civilian 
power sector. 
Lastly, our bill invests in strength-
ening our cybersecurity workforce. As 
our electric grid continues to mod-
ernize with renewable energy and en-
ergy storage technologies, a high- 
skilled workforce will be needed who 
understand the evolving threats. 
I look forward to working with the 
Senate to get this bill passed into law 
so we can continue to improve the re-
siliency of our electric grid. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this commonsense legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND 
TECHNOLOGY, 
Washington, DC, September 2, 2020. 
Chairman BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Committee on Homeland Security, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: I am writing to 
you concerning H.R. 5760, the ‘‘Grid Security 
Research and Development Act,’’ which was 
referred to the Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology, and in addition to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security on February 5, 
2020. 
I appreciate your willingness to work coop-
eratively on this bill. I recognize that the 
bill contains provisions that fall within the 
jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland 
Security. I appreciate that your Committee 
will waive further consideration of H.R. 5760 
and that this action is not a waiver of future 
jurisdictional claims by the Committee on 
Homeland Security over this subject matter. 
I will make sure to include our exchange of 
letters in the legislative report for H.R. 5760 
and in the Congressional Record. Thank you 
for your cooperation on this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, last week when the 
House considered the massive Clean 
Economy Jobs and Innovation Act, I 
expressed my disappointment with the 
partisan policies in the bill, with the 
rushed and irresponsible process of 
writing it, and, most of all, with the 
sheer number of missed bipartisan leg-
islative opportunities it represents. 
This week, I am glad to see that my 
friends across the aisle have taken 
heed of those words. 
The Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology has one of the best 
track records in Congress for passing 
productive, bipartisan legislation, and 
I am pleased to see us upholding that 
tradition once again. 
H.R. 5760, the Grid Security Research 
and Development Act is a truly bipar-
tisan Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology product. It is spon-
sored by vice-chairman AMI BERA and 
Energy subcommittee Ranking Mem-
ber RANDY WEBER. It has gone through 
regular order, and is the result of 
thoughtful consideration, careful anal-
ysis, and substantial debate. I support 
its passage today. 
Currently, the U.S. energy sector and 
its aging electrical grid faces many 
critical challenges, like higher de-
mand, vulnerability to cyberattacks, 
and increased integration of new en-
ergy sources. It is our job in Congress 
to set the priorities to meet these chal-
lenges and to focus our limited Federal 
funds where we can see the best return 
on investment. 
To deliver effective solutions, we 
must take the long-term and big-pic-
ture approach. We must support early- 
stage research that will spur innova-
tion over a broad range of energy appli-
cations and provide for R&D to mobi-
lize and defend our critical energy in-
frastructure. 
The bipartisan Grid Security Re-
search 
and 
Development 
Act 
will 
strengthen our Nation’s electric grid 
against rapidly changing technological 
challenges. It authorizes the Depart-
ment of Energy’s vital cybersecurity 
and emergency response R&D activities 
and directs DOE to work with relevant 
Federal agencies to develop cybersecu-
rity best practices. 
Through 
the 
committee 
markup 
process, we were able to improve this 
legislation by adding key research in-
frastructure provisions from my legis-
lation, H.R. 5685, the Securing Amer-
ican Leadership in Science and Tech-
nology Act. 
This provision requires the Secretary 
to carry out a program of research, de-
velopment, and a demonstration of 
technologies and tools to help ensure 
the resilience and security of critical 
integrated grid infrastructures. 
It also requires the Secretary to es-
tablish and operate a critical infra-
structure test facility that allows for 
both physical and cyber performance 
testing to be conducted on large-scale 
infrastructure systems. This test facil-
ity will amplify and accelerate the 
high-priority research and develop-
ment activities authorized in the origi-
nal text and maximize the return on 
investment of taxpayers’ dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank my good 
friends across the aisle for working 
with us to come to agreement on this 
provision and on this bill. I am glad to 
see we can come together to focus on 
our shared interest in improving U.S. 
national security and energy resilience 
for the next generation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. WEBER), the ranking member of 
the Energy Subcommittee. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
also thank Representative BERA for in-
troducing this bill with me. I am proud 
to rise in support of H.R. 5760. 
Mr. Speaker, cyber and physical 
threats to our electric grid are con-
stantly evolving in technique and in-
creasing in number. This challenge is 
magnified by its complexity. No two 
attacks are exactly the same.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5030 
September 29, 2020 
Last year in the United States, the 
energy sector ranked ninth in indus-
tries most targeted by cyberattacks. In 
fact, IBM estimated that cyberattacks 
against 
vital 
energy 
sector 
tech-
nologies, like industrial control and 
operational systems, increased by more 
than 2,000 percent—2,000 percent. 
Mr. Speaker, it is clear that we must 
be prepared to address this threat as 
we continue to build on the success of 
our clean energy future and long-term 
international competitiveness. Every 
single aspect of our daily lives in each 
economic sector in our Nation is de-
pendent on the uninterrupted flow of 
power. I like to say that the things 
that make America great are the 
things that America makes. 
How do we do that? With an uninter-
rupted, affordable flow of power. 
Therefore, we must focus heavily on 
early-stage research into new tech-
nologies that will improve the resil-
ience, the reliability, and the emer-
gency response capabilities of our elec-
tric grid. 
H.R. 5760 does that by authorizing a 
multi-agency research and develop-
ment program to bolster the cyber and 
physical security capabilities of the en-
ergy sector. 
It authorizes key Federal agencies, 
like the Department of Energy and the 
National Science Foundation, to sup-
port 
early-stage 
research, 
develop-
ment, and demonstration activities 
that will advance critical cybersecu-
rity technologies and enhance the secu-
rity of energy sector information sys-
tems. 
Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased to 
say, as the ranking member did, that 
this bill is truly bipartisan. We worked 
closely together to develop good legis-
lation, and we included a key Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Republican priority; that is, a 
critical infrastructure research pro-
gram and test facility. 
This provision, originally offered by 
my 
good 
friend, 
Ranking 
Member 
LUCAS’ bill, H.R. 5685, the Securing 
American Leadership in Science and 
Technology Act, was accepted as an 
amendment at committee markup. 
In coordination with the Department 
of Defense and the Department of 
Homeland Security, the DOE-led re-
search program and test facility will 
allow for U.S. researchers to conduct a 
variety of high-priority tests on crit-
ical infrastructure systems at the in-
dustry scale. This facility is a perfect 
example of the research asset that the 
Federal government is best suited to 
provide. 
As recent events have shown us, it is 
not a question of if the U.S. power grid 
will face a significant physical or cyber 
threat, it is only a matter of when. In 
order to improve the cyber and phys-
ical security of our Nation’s energy 
sector, we, in Congress, must continue 
to prioritize R&D to modernize and 
strengthen the national electricity sys-
tem. 
We can’t agree on everything—I get 
that—especially when wish lists and 
partisan messaging exercises rule the 
day. However, when we identify our 
shared goals and work together in good 
faith, we can put together real legisla-
tion and find a path forward for the 
benefit of the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Dr. BERA 
for introducing this legislation, and 
Members and staff of both sides of the 
aisle for working in a collaborative 
manner to reach a consensus on this 
standalone bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
There is real power in doing so. 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I, too, also 
want to recognize the bipartisan na-
ture of this bill. It shows what we can 
do when we get together. I recognize 
the hard work of the staff from the 
Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no additional 
speakers, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we must invest in the 
long-term, early-stage research that 
will strengthen our energy infrastruc-
ture against a range of emerging 
threats. 
The Department of Energy is unique-
ly qualified to lead this endeavor, and 
the partnerships that exist between its 
national laboratory systems, univer-
sities, and industry has the potential 
to modernize and transform U.S. en-
ergy delivery systems. 
H.R. 5760 authorizes the advanced 
grid security R&D activities that will 
make the future U.S. electrical grid re-
liable, resilient, and secure for all 
Americans. 
I, again, thank my friends across the 
aisle for working with us on this bill. 
We need to come together and have se-
rious conversations about how to make 
real progress on next-generation en-
ergy issues. I am glad to see us doing 
that today. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1700 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I, once 
again, urge support of this common-
sense, important legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 5760, the Grid Secu-
rity Research and Development Act. I want to 
thank Mr. BERA for his leadership in intro-
ducing this bipartisan bill and for his commit-
ment to developing legislation that will help 
strengthen America’s electricity grid. I also 
want to thank my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle who have recognized the impor-
tance of these investments and have joined 
me in supporting this important legislation. 
The Grid Security Research and Develop-
ment Act is updated version of a bill that Mr. 
BERA and I introduced, along with many of my 
Science Committee colleagues, in the pre-
vious two Congresses. This bill provides legis-
lative guidance to the activities carried out by 
the recently established Department of Energy 
Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and 
Emergency Response by authorizing a cross- 
agency research and development program to 
advance electric grid cybersecurity and phys-
ical security. In particular, the bill authorizes 
activities on grid resilience and emergency re-
sponse efforts, cybersecurity test beds, and 
education and workforce training for the en-
ergy sector. 
The passage of this bill is particularly impor-
tant now, as states all over the U.S. are expe-
riencing 
unprecedented 
extreme 
weather 
events, ranging from historic hurricanes in 
Texas to the ongoing wildfires in California 
and Oregon. In California specifically, utilities 
are shutting off power to millions of customers 
when there are high winds in certain areas to 
prevent the onset of wildfires sparked by trees 
and other vegetation near critical grid infra-
structure. This bill contains provisions to help 
address these important issues by directing 
the Department of Energy to conduct research 
on technologies to assist with the safe plan-
ning and execution of emergency power shut-
offs, offer technical assistance on related top-
ics, and establish a training program to im-
prove grid resilience, among other provisions. 
That’s why I am proud to rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5760. It would make important in-
vestments to improve the security and ensure 
the safety and resilience of our electric grid in-
frastructure. I also urge my colleagues to 
make a wise investment for our nation by join-
ing me in supporting this bipartisan bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
BERA) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 5760, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5031 
September 29, 2020 
produce results detrimental to the safety 
and well-being of the United States and its 
people: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) reaffirms its commitment to the or-
derly and peaceful transfer of power called 
for in the Constitution of the United States; 
and 
(2) intends that there should be no disrup-
tions by the President or any person in 
power to overturn the will of the people of 
the United States. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SWALWELL) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. STEUBE) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. 
Speaker I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
resolution, H. Res. 1155, reaffirming the 
commitment of the House of Rep-
resentatives to the peaceful transfer of 
power. This is identical to the resolu-
tion which passed the Senate last week 
by unanimous consent. 
The peaceful transition of power is 
not only a bedrock principle of Amer-
ica’s founding; it is a living ideal that 
we must exercise and pass down to our 
children. 
In the United States of America, the 
Federal Government has always had a 
peaceful transition of power, and it is a 
collective responsibility of this body to 
ensure that continues. I doubt anyone 
here needs to be reminded of that. 
Everyone in America knows this is 
what makes us American. Everyone, 
that is, except President Trump. Last 
week, he was asked a simple question: 
Will you commit to making sure there 
is a peaceful transfer of power after the 
election? His answer: Well, we are 
going to have to see what happens. 
No, we are not going to have to see 
what happens. 
Then he was asked again: Do you 
commit to making sure there is a 
peaceful transfer of power? 
Here was his answer, in part: Get rid 
of the ballots, and you will have a 
very—we will have a very peaceful— 
there won’t be a transfer, frankly. 
There will be a continuation. 
During his remarks, he also made 
bogus and unsupported claims of elec-
tion fraud. Just in case people were not 
listening, he said the same thing the 
next day. 
President Trump, like any President, 
wields enormous power, with Federal 
law enforcement and the military at 
his disposal. It is beyond unsettling to 
hear him suggest that the only result 
he will accept is the one where he wins. 
That sentiment is one of dictators 
and despots. Sadly, the world is replete 
with examples of dictators and despots 
and their refusal to leave office and the 
chaos it causes. 
In late 2016, Gambia’s President 
threatened to refuse to leave office, 
even though he had lost the election. 
Thousands fled the country fearing vio-
lence. Only when other countries’ 
troops massed at the border was he 
forced to leave office in early 2017. 
Congo’s President refused to leave of-
fice in 2016, even though his term had 
expired. He cracked down on dissent 
and killed people when they protested 
the election results. That election fi-
nally took place two years late. 
Last year in Bolivia, the President 
declared himself the winner before the 
vote counting was even finished. After 
days of civil unrest and protest, the 
President was forced to resign. 
Belarus remains in crisis even now as 
the longtime President holds onto 
power through an obviously rigged 
election. Mass protests have gone on 
with many injured, gassed, or killed. 
In America, however, it is not one 
person, but we, the people; we, the peo-
ple, who rule. As this resolution says, 
the people have the right to change 
their elected leaders through elections. 
Fortunately, there is no shortage of 
leadership in America’s past to show us 
the way. 
I was born in November of 1980, right 
after Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald 
Reagan. I was born the son of two Re-
publican parents who were excited for 
the peaceful transfer of power to take 
place. One of my earliest memories of 
American politics, though, was when I 
was 11 years old and President George 
H. W. Bush lost to President Clinton. 
My parents were not as excited about 
the peaceful transfer of power. 
But I remember, as a boy, watching 
the results come in and seeing the 
statements from outgoing President 
George H. W. Bush and commentators 
and anchors saying, ‘‘This is what 
makes our country so special’’ and my 
own family moving on and accepting 
the results. 
In a poignant recognition of this, lis-
ten to part of what former President 
George Herbert Walker Bush wrote to 
President Bill Clinton, the man who 
had defeated him, in a note that he left 
for him in the Oval Office dated Janu-
ary 20, 1993. And it is just here to my 
left. 
‘‘You will be our President when you 
read this note. I wish you well. I wish 
your family well. Your success now is 
our country’s success. I am rooting 
hard for you.’’ 
After the 1824 election was decided 
here, in this House, with Henry Clay 
throwing his support to John Quincy 
Adams, thus defeating Andrew Jackson 
who had won the popular vote, Jackson 
was understandably outraged and de-
nounced the result as a corrupt bar-
gain. That type of language sounds fa-
miliar. But he accepted the outcome 
and returned to Tennessee. 
On the evening of the day he lost the 
Presidency, Jackson encountered the 
new 
President-Elect 
at 
the 
White 
House. Jackson was gracious, and the 
city was filled with reports of his 
grace. ‘‘You have, by your dignity and 
forbearance under all of these outrages, 
won the people to your love,’’ a friend 
told Jackson, who would run again in 
1828 and win. 
Historian 
Jon 
Meacham 
recently 
wrote in March of this year about 
President Lincoln in 1864, the country 
mired in a Civil War, running against 
George McClellan on the Democratic 
side. Lincoln had written privately he 
was ready to accept defeat, the election 
did not look like it was going to go his 
way, and even in a Civil War, there 
would be a peaceful transfer of power. 
This resolution states clearly to 
every American, not on our watch. Not 
on our watch are we going to let Amer-
ican greatness vanish and an authori-
tative state rise. 
The reason we are the beacon to the 
world is that here, with our elections, 
the people decide, not our leaders. We 
let the people decide. 
We shouldn’t only be horrified by the 
President’s remarks about possibly not 
having a peaceful transfer of power; we 
should also be concerned by who he 
looks up to. Unfortunately, America is 
ruled by someone who admires dic-
tators. He said as much recently to Bob 
Woodward in a recording stating: ‘‘The 
tougher and meaner they are, the bet-
ter I get along with them,’’ referring to 
dictators like Putin, Erdogan, and 
Kim. 
And what do dictators do? 
They don’t let the people decide, and 
they certainly don’t honor any peace-
ful transition of power. 
Why is it a problem for Americans to 
have a leader who admires Putin and 
often sides with Putin over America? 
Because we know that Vladimir Putin 
would love nothing better than to de-
stroy our democracy. 
In fact, our intelligence community 
assessed that in 2016, Vladimir Putin 
had a preference for our President and 
interfered to help him and that he is 
doing the same today. Putin wants 
America to be weak, second to Russia, 
just another country with no moral 
standing in the world. 
But what makes us strong is our rule 
of law, our democracy, a country gov-
erned by the consent of the people. 
When that happens, we all do better, 
and Russia hates that. Why? Because 
Russians and other oppressed people 
then will want to look more like Amer-
ica. 
Just think about it. The idea now 
that Russia could bring down America 
without even firing a shot because we 
have one person who is threatening to 
upset the fabric of our democracy. We 
cannot let that happen. Too many have 
sacrificed too much to make sure it 
doesn’t happen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5032 
September 29, 2020 
Days after the election, we will each 
go back to our districts and honor 
those who have served our country in 
honor of Veterans Day. We will be re-
minded of so many heroes who have 
died and shed blood, just for the prin-
ciple of a peaceful transition of power. 
We have lost so many for this concept. 
Now, I know there are some in this 
country who think that these heroes 
who fought for this country are suck-
ers and losers for giving up their lives, 
but I don’t think that. I don’t believe 
my Republican colleagues think that. I 
know colleagues on both sides hold 
these folks up to be heroes. I know 
each of us wants to go to our home-
towns right after election day to those 
Veterans Day parades, look at our 
hometown heroes, look them in the 
eyes and tell them when our democracy 
was threatened, we stood up and we 
spoke out. 
The way we honor their sacrifice is 
to fight for this. And when someone 
suggests that a peaceful transfer of 
power may not happen, we have to push 
back in every way we can. 
So I want to thank all of my col-
leagues, both Democrats and Repub-
licans, who over the past few days have 
reaffirmed the understanding of how in 
America 
we 
handle 
transitions 
of 
power and reject the threats from our 
current leader that it may not happen. 
By voting for this resolution, you can 
go on record as supporting these prin-
ciples. By its text, it ‘‘reaffirms the 
House’s commitment to the orderly 
and peaceful transfer of power called 
for in the Constitution of the United 
States; and intends that there should 
be no disruption by the President or 
any person in power to overturn the 
will of the people of the United 
States.’’ 
Even in this era of bitterly divided 
partisanship, these are basic, philo-
sophical tenets, bedrocks and living 
principles that should receive unani-
mous support here in the House. 
I urge all Members to support my 
resolution, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we are here to 
waste time on an unnecessary resolu-
tion to commit to a peaceful transfer 
of power. 
To be clear, President Trump and 
House Republicans are committed to 
ensuring Americans receive a free and 
fair election. Republicans are also com-
mitted 
to 
peaceful 
transitions 
of 
power. 
Democrats have been the ones to con-
test Presidential elections. They con-
tested the 2000 election, they contested 
the 2004 election, and Democrats still 
refuse to believe that President Trump 
won the 2016 election fair and square. 
So ahead of November 3, 2020, the 
Democrats are using floor time for par-
tisan smear tactics to undermine the 
President. 
The administration has been clear. 
On September 24, 2020, Press Secretary 
Kayleigh McEnany stated: ‘‘The Presi-
dent will accept the results of a free 
and fair election. He will accept the 
will of the American people.’’ 
The real question today is: Will the 
Democrats accept the results of the 
election? 
They are already questioning the le-
gitimacy of this election. Hillary Clin-
ton, the Democrats’ nominee in 2016, 
has advised: ‘‘Joe Biden should not 
concede under any circumstances.’’ 
A senior House Democrat stated that 
President Trump is not going to win 
fairly. 
b 1715 
Democrat Presidential nominee Joe 
Biden has said that his ‘‘single greatest 
concern’’ is that the President is 
‘‘going to try and steal this election.’’ 
This resolution is just another at-
tempt by the Democrats to instill fear 
within the American people, just one 
more hoax for them to perpetrate upon 
the American people. 
Not 
only 
have 
Democrats 
pre-
maturely questioned the results of the 
election; they have proactively sought 
to erode basic election security safe-
guards as States move toward all mail- 
in voting, universal mail-in ballots. 
This is the concern that President 
Trump has been warning about. 
In several States, Democrats are try-
ing to eliminate absentee ballot wit-
ness and notary requirements, expand-
ing ballot harvesting, and extending 
deadlines for States to receive mail-in 
ballots for up to a week after the elec-
tion. If successful, Democrats will in-
evitably open the door to election 
crimes and administration errors. 
So while making baseless accusations 
about President Trump stealing the 
election, Democrats are also under-
mining the integrity of the electoral 
process by pushing for less account-
ability. On top of that, we are here 
today to consider a resolution to chas-
tise the President for raising policy 
concerns about the process. This is ri-
diculous, and it needs to stop. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I stand in 
strong support of this resolution. 
There has been quite a bit of discus-
sion regarding partisanship from some 
of my friends on the other side of the 
aisle. I would offer the following quote, 
which was uttered 39 years ago: ‘‘To a 
few of us here today, this is a solemn 
and most momentous occasion, and 
yet, in the history of our Nation, it is 
a commonplace occurrence. The or-
derly transfer of authority, as called 
for in the Constitution, routinely takes 
place as it has almost for two cen-
turies, and few of us stop to think how 
unique we really are. In the eyes of 
many in the world, this every-4-year 
ceremony that we accept as normal is 
nothing less than a miracle.’’ 
Those words were uttered in 1981 by 
President Ronald Reagan, and his 
words couldn’t have been more pre-
scient. 
It is a shame that we are here today, 
a shame that the current President has 
refused to affirm perhaps that most 
basic tenet of American democracy, 
the peaceful transfer of power after an 
election. 
I don’t believe that this should be 
partisan. We may be on different sides 
of the aisle; we have different solutions 
to some of the most pressing chal-
lenges that our country faces; but we 
all should, we all must, believe in this 
grand American experiment. 
The peaceful transition of power is a 
hallmark of our Republic. For over 200 
years, as President Reagan noted, 
every President has honored the or-
derly and peaceful transfer of power to 
his successor. 
So, in my view, the House of Rep-
resentatives must speak loudly here. 
We must meet the unrelenting insist-
ence on undermining our democracy 
with the full force of the United States 
Congress by joining together today, on 
a bipartisan basis, to reaffirm our com-
mitment to the peaceful transition of 
power, as our colleagues in the United 
States Senate did just last week. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
SWALWELL for leading on this issue, 
and I would urge every one of my col-
leagues in this Chamber, Republican, 
Democrat, and independent, to support 
this important resolution. 
Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I agree 
with my colleagues across the aisle. 
This should not be a partisan matter. 
We shouldn’t have to be here today. 
But unfortunately, the Democrats de-
cided to make this partisan. 
I begged to be allowed to make an 
amendment because this is one slap at 
a man who has already made clear, yes, 
he wants to stop fraudulent voting and 
make sure that hadn’t occurred, but he 
is going to abide by the will of the peo-
ple. Yet, they refused to allow any 
amendments. 
It says, it is resolved that the House 
of Representatives ‘‘intends that there 
should be no disruptions by the Presi-
dent or any person in power to over-
turn. . . .’’ They would not accept a 
friendly amendment, so it could be 
completely bipartisan, to say, ‘‘or any 
candidate or anyone acting on a can-
didate’s behalf,’’ which would have in-
cluded the President. Oh, no, we have 
to have a slap at the President. 
As my friend Mr. STEUBE pointed out, 
it is not Republicans who have divided 
this country in refusing to accept re-
sults of the elections. No, you go back 
to 1860. November 6, 1860, Republican 
Abraham Lincoln is elected President 
by a big margin, and then States start 
seceding. They are not going to accept 
the results.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5033 
September 29, 2020 
Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated. 
Back then, it was March 4, 1861. States 
were already seceding. We are not ac-
cepting the results. And they were, 
every one a Democrat, saying that we 
are not going to accept that Repub-
lican’s election to President. 
Then, what do we hear from Hillary 
Clinton? She has been quoted as saying 
that ‘‘Joe Biden should not concede 
under any circumstances, because I 
think this is going to drag out.’’ 
Go back 100 years, after the Demo-
crats refused to accept the results of 
the election of 1860. In 1960, John F. 
Kennedy was elected, and I have con-
firmed again today with someone who 
worked closely with Nixon that he had 
information submitted to him that es-
tablished that there was much wrong-
doing in Chicago, Illinois, fraudulent 
voting schemes. 
Despite what any others may think 
about Richard Nixon, he made the deci-
sion that the country could not stand 
that kind of divisiveness, so he refused 
to pursue the fraud of which he was 
told there was plenty of evidence in 
Chicago, Illinois. That is the way the 
Republicans have been. 
Then, we hear more sanctimonious 
talk about George W. Bush, and then 
who contested the election? Well, Al 
Gore. He calls and concedes, and then 
he later calls and backs it up. Thank 
goodness he wasn’t President when we 
needed a decisive leader. 
But if you go through the chronology 
of Gore’s defeat by President Bush— 
and a recount ultimately showed that 
he did lose. Gore did lose; Bush did win. 
But he was still contesting. He divided 
this Nation, refused to accept the re-
sults of the election, brought up some 
of the most ridiculous things from the 
butterfly ballot that kids in the fifth 
grade had no problem with. Oh, but it 
is unfair because they can’t really un-
derstand it in that part of Florida. 
What an insult to those people in Flor-
ida. 
If you look now at what the Demo-
cratic Party is saying about this elec-
tion in response to President Trump 
saying, I just want to make sure that it 
is not fraudulent voting; it is fair vot-
ing. And as long as everything is legal 
and fair, you betcha, he will have a 
smooth transition of power. He would 
agree to that. 
But if you look, as reported on Au-
gust 2 of this year, buried near the end 
of Ben Smith’s column is a report that 
‘‘Democrats have participated in a ‘war 
game’ in which they considered several 
possible outcomes of the election. In 
one scenario, John Podesta, the former 
chair of Hillary Clinton’s Presidential 
campaign and a leading figure in party 
circles, played former Vice President 
Joe Biden and refused to concede the 
election.’’ 
Then later it was posted—much more 
recently, I guess, that is September 6: 
‘‘Democrats promise more violence if 
Joe Biden doesn’t defeat Trump by a 
landslide in the 2020 election. Rosa 
Brooks, a leftist who writes for The 
Washington Post, penned a piece that 
stated her research showed that the 
only scenario in November that would 
stop the violence is if Biden wins in a 
landslide. That kind of attempt to ma-
nipulate the voters by intimidation 
will just make Americans vote for 
Trump.’’ 
It was posted September 6 in the 
American Thinker. ‘‘Democrats openly 
say that if Trump is reelected, they are 
going to redouble their 4 years of mad-
ness, with special emphasis on the last 
3 months of open violence. Indeed, they 
are already planning to destabilize the 
election and to contest if Trump wins, 
in hopes of a violent coup.’’ 
And as if there is not a God in Heav-
en, today of all days, when this that 
should have been bipartisan is brought 
to the floor to slam Donald Trump, we 
have newly released information out 
today that has been declassified. This 
report, on September 7, 2016: ‘‘U.S. in-
telligence officials forwarded an inves-
tigative referral to FBI Director James 
Comey and Deputy Assistant Director 
of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok re-
garding ‘U.S. Presidential candidate 
Hillary Clinton’s approval of a plan 
concerning U.S. Presidential candidate 
Donald Trump and Russian hackers 
hampering U.S. elections as a means of 
distracting the public from her use of a 
private mail server.’ ’’ 
Then further, it came out today: ‘‘A 
former senior intelligence official told 
saraacarter.com that it would make 
sense that Clinton’s plans would be 
usurped by the Russia’s GRU, its mili-
tary intelligence, as well as Russia’s 
FSB, its equivalent of the CIA, when 
former British spy Christopher Steele 
began peddling the Russians for infor-
mation.’’ 
‘‘The real people colluding and con-
spiring with Russia were the Demo-
crats, Hillary Clinton, and Fusion 
GPS,’’ stated the source. ‘‘It is the 
weaponization of the agencies and 
those like Clinton who built their pri-
vate Idaho in the U.S. bureaucracy. 
They gave the keys to the kingdom to 
Russia to wreak chaos in our Nation 
for the past 4 years.’’ 
Moreover, the information that came 
out today reveals that former CIA Di-
rector John Brennan allegedly knew of 
Clinton’s plans and briefed President 
Obama on those plans in July 2016. It 
was the same month the FBI opened up 
the Crossfire Hurricane investigation 
against President Trump and his cam-
paign—or candidate Trump and his 
campaign officials. 
So, what a day, the day that more 
evidence comes out that it was Hillary 
Clinton’s campaign, the DNC, and they 
were refusing to go along with the 
legal and fair election. Then, after-
ward, that whole conspiracy, the dos-
sier was used to try to prevent a Presi-
dent from staying in office after sworn 
in, and we are supposed to vote now to 
come after President Trump and de-
mand he be legal and lawful in leaving 
office. 
He just wants fairness in the vote, 
and he will follow the will of the peo-
ple. It is a real shame that my friends 
across the aisle wouldn’t allow an 
amendment, so we could say to both 
sides: Follow the will of the people; 
have a proper transition of power. 
But, no, they wouldn’t go there. 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, here we are, back to 
Secretary Clinton. It is clear that she 
has at least two homes, one in New 
York and one inside the heads of my 
colleagues. But this is actually about 
President Trump. 
While I appreciate my colleagues 
speaking for what President Trump 
may do after the election, citing what 
his press secretary has said, and my 
colleague from Texas said that he be-
lieves that the President will peace-
fully accept the transfer of power, the 
President has never said that. 
In fact, he was asked: ‘‘Will you com-
mit to making sure there is a peaceful 
transfer of power after the election?’’ 
And he said: ‘‘Well, we are going to 
have to see what happens.’’ 
He is not saying we are going to have 
to go to the courts, that we are going 
to contest this. He is suggesting that 
we may have something other than a 
peaceful transfer of power, which, of 
course, would be a violent transfer of 
power, a violent holding of power. 
Then, he was asked again: ‘‘Will you 
commit to making sure that there is a 
peaceful transfer of power?’’ And he 
said: ‘‘Get rid of the ballots and we will 
have a very peaceful—there won’t be a 
transfer, frankly. There will be a con-
tinuation.’’ 
Again, not himself saying there will 
be a peaceful transfer of power. So, we 
really can’t rely on anyone else, other 
than what the President has said. 
b 1730 
So we really can’t rely on anyone 
else other than what the President has 
said. And I don’t disagree with my col-
leagues that if there are issues in the 
election that both parties have a right 
to contest those issues, to go to the 
courts through the legal channels, but 
that is not what this is about. 
This resolution talks about a peace-
ful transfer of power. In fact, they were 
complaining that it is not a bipartisan 
resolution. Actually, it is identical to 
the bipartisan, unanimously passed 
resolution in the Senate. 
To my colleague from Florida who is 
controlling time on the other side, I 
understand he doesn’t like that this 
resolution is on the floor, and I would 
yield to my colleague respecting his 
service as a veteran, in our country, he 
is voting for this resolution. I would be 
shocked if I heard that my colleague is 
not going to vote for something that 
passed unanimously in the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. GAETZ).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5034 
September 29, 2020 
time manager were directed to my col-
league from Florida, it will likely not 
surprise him that I will regularly vote 
against things that pass unanimously 
in the United States Senate. I don’t 
hold that as a standard. 
We are here on a resolution regarding 
the peaceful transition of power. We 
barely had a peaceful transition of 
power in 2016. My colleague, the gen-
tleman from California, was on tele-
vision almost every night telling the 
American people that President Trump 
was an agent of the Russian Govern-
ment. How fake it all turned out to be. 
I rise in opposition to this resolution 
even though I completely support the 
peaceful transfer of power. This resolu-
tion is a way for Democrats to attack 
the President and disguise the fact 
that they will refuse to accept the elec-
tion results unless they win. 
Professional loser Hillary Clinton has 
told Joe Biden that he should not con-
cede ‘‘under any circumstances.’’ 
The Transition Integrity Project has 
said that the aftermath of the Novem-
ber election will be a ‘‘street fight, not 
a legal battle.’’ The same report sug-
gests that Biden could even try to con-
vince States to secede from the Union 
before accepting a Trump victory. 
Are these the actions of a party will-
ing to accept defeat? They weren’t will-
ing to accept defeat in the 2016 elec-
tion. They had to go blame the Rus-
sians. I guess I am still waiting for the 
13 Russians who were indicted to show 
up. 
No, this resolution is projecting and 
gaslighting. 
The media has begun gaslighting the 
public, too, saying that it may look 
like Trump won on election night, but 
that as ballots are counted, States will 
flip. How will this great switch be ac-
complished? Through the Democrats’ 
usual methods: lawfare, fraud, and vio-
lence. 
Look at what we have already seen: 
Mike Bloomberg is trying to quite lit-
erally buy votes from felons in Florida; 
in Pennsylvania, absentee ballots for 
President Trump were found in a 
dumpster; and in Minnesota, Democrat 
operatives were caught on camera dis-
cussing forcible illegal ballot har-
vesting. 
Democrats ignore all this. They are 
not on the floor to condemn any of it. 
As a matter of fact, they have ignored 
it the same way they ignored the riots 
and arson and violence in America’s 
cities, the same way they ignore the 
antifa goon squads and the gangs of 
fascists in brown shirts who threaten 
to harm anyone who does not want 
America to become their communist 
woketopia. 
Democrats ignore criminality when 
it helps them and because they not-so- 
secretly believe that anyone who is 
punched or maimed or assaulted by 
antifa might deserve it, especially if 
they are a member of our brave law en-
forcement. 
Democrats ignore these heinous acts 
of violence when the victims are Re-
publican or when they are pro-life or 
when 
they 
are 
Trump 
supporters. 
Those lives don’t matter to Democrats. 
But they are more than happy to burn 
America to the ground when they 
think it will help them. 
This resolution is part of the Demo-
crats’ plan to lay the groundwork for a 
color revolution, the ousting of an 
elected leader and calling it democ-
racy. But that is not democracy. It is 
nothing less than the destruction of 
our cherished Nation. 
I unequivocally support the peaceful 
transfer of power but will vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this resolution, and I encourage my 
colleagues to do the same. I will pray 
that America survives the Democrats’ 
mad and destructive lust for power. 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. 
Speaker, may I inquire how many more 
speakers the minority floor manager 
has remaining. 
Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close. 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr Speaker, let’s be clear: The real 
threat to our democracy are the at-
tempts to undermine the election proc-
ess. 
Universal mail-in voting is not the 
same as absentee ballots like we do in 
Florida. When a voter requests an ab-
sentee ballot, she knows to expect it. 
Universal 
mail-in 
voting 
is 
when 
States mass mail ballots to voters, 
whether or not a voter has moved, has 
died, or is otherwise no longer eligible 
to vote or is even a citizen of our coun-
try. Universal mail-in voting increases 
the risk of election crime or adminis-
trative error because States are pro-
viding prepaid return envelopes for 
election ballots. 
The U.S. Postal Service does not 
typically postmark premarked mail, 
and although it has a policy to post-
mark election-related mail, its policy 
is not foolproof, as we have seen in 
some primary elections over the sum-
mer. 
All of these last-minute changes will 
harm the integrity of the election proc-
ess and risk chaos in the general elec-
tion. We are already seeing the disas-
trous results of the Democrats’ last- 
minute process changes. 
Last week, the Justice Department 
found that several military ballots 
were discarded in Luzerne County, 
Pennsylvania. Seven of the nine ballots 
were cast for President Trump—not 
surprising. 
This month, the Georgia Secretary of 
State revealed that at least 1,000 Geor-
gians voted twice in the June 2020 pri-
mary, once via mail-in balloting and 
once in person. 
In New York, Governor Cuomo’s last- 
minute shift to all-mail voting cost 
thousands of ballots in Chairwoman 
MALONEY’s primary to be discarded for 
lacking postmarks. Election officials 
took 6 weeks to certify the results of 
the primary. 
In a New Jersey municipal election, a 
last-minute shift to all-mail voting re-
sulted in the Postal Service still deliv-
ering ballots to election officials weeks 
after the election. 
If these problems occurred in local 
primary elections, the risk to a na-
tional general election is even greater. 
The President is right to highlight 
these problems, and I fail to under-
stand why Democrats won’t. 
The best and surest guarantee of 
electoral integrity is for Americans to 
vote in person where safe and possible, 
with absentee ballots available for 
those who legitimately cannot make it 
to the polls or have voter ID safeguards 
in places like we have in Florida. 
This resolution is nothing but polit-
ical messaging and creating a narrative 
without any facts to base it, just like 
the Russia collusion hoax. 
There is no question that every sin-
gle 
American, 
including 
President 
Trump, wants a peaceful transfer of 
power after a free and fair election, but 
this rhetoric and fear-mongering by 
our friends across the aisle must end. 
The liberal mainstream media and 
Democrats should stop this nonsense 
and let the American people speak. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. 
Speaker, may I inquire how much time 
is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 5 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
This resolution simply calls for a 
commitment to the peaceful transfer of 
power. I know my colleagues on the 
other side have their own suspicions 
about what the motive is behind this 
and want to project onto it something 
that is not in the language, but this 
was passed by 100 Senators last week. 
Every Republican and Democratic Sen-
ator voted for this because it reaffirms 
America’s commitment to having a 
peaceful transfer of power. 
What my colleague on the other side 
just brought up are process issues in 
the election, but that does not relate 
or compare to the suggestion that 
there would be violent opposition to 
the outcome. 
Both sides have a right to use the 
courts and then accept the outcome. 
One of my colleagues referenced the 
2000 election, litigated all the way to 
the top of the Supreme Court, and the 
loser accepted the outcome. 
This resolution is calling on us, and 
it is sad that we have to do this, to re-
affirm that principle. It asks the ques-
tion: Are we Gambia, where an out-
come was not accepted and people died, 
or are we a country that, even in the 
thick of the Civil War, had a President 
who was willing to accept the out-
come? 
Are we Congo where the outcome was 
not accepted and people died, or are we 
the country that fought the great war,

the Second World War, the Greatest 
Generation, who would build a new 
economy and afford new opportunities? 
Are we Bolivia, where the outcome 
was not accepted and there was vio-
lence in the streets, or are we the coun-
try that sent someone to the Moon, 
saw contested election after contested 
election, but losers left office gra-
ciously, just as President H.W. Bush 
did in the letter I read earlier. 
Who do we want to look like? We are 
imperfect, but the ideas that we are 
founded upon are perfect, that we are 
governed by consent, not by leaders or 
violence, consent of the people. That is 
what this resolution says. 
Thirty-five days to go to the elec-
tion. I know it is going to be tense in 
this Chamber, it is going to be tense in 
this country, but unity in our country 
during our darkest times has always 
been an antidote against anything that 
would seek to divide us or take us 
away from who we want to be, who we 
can be, and who we should be—a more 
perfect Union. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SWALWELL) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 1155. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

SERVICES 
REP-

JOHN H. RUTHERFORD, MEMBER 
OF CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from Amanda Torbush, Con-
stituent Services Representative, the 
Honorable JOHN H. RUTHERFORD, Mem-
ber of Congress: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, September 25, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAME SPEAKER: This is to notify 
you formally, pursuant to Rule VIII of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, that 
the United States Navy has served me, 
Amanda Torbush, with a subpoena to testify 
before a Special Court-Martial of the United 
States. 
After consultation with the Office of Gen-
eral Counsel, I have determined that compli-
ance with the subpoena is consistent with 
the privileges and rights of the House. 
Sincerely, 
AMANDA TORBUSH, 
Constituent Services Representative. 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker pro 
tempore (Mr. PETERS) at 6 o’clock and 
25 minutes p.m. 
f 
RAISING A QUESTION OF THE 
PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to bring forth the privileged resolution, 
H. Res. 1148. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the resolution. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
H. RES. 1148 
Whereas, on July 22, 2020, H.R. 7573 was 
brought to the House floor for a vote, with 
the purpose of eliminating four specific stat-
ues or busts from the United States Capitol 
along with all others that include individ-
uals who ‘‘served as an officer or voluntarily 
with the Confederate States of America or of 
the military forces or government of a State 
while the State was in rebellion against the 
United States’’ yet failed to address the 
most ever-present historical stigma in the 
United States Capitol; that is the source 
that so fervently supported, condoned and 
fought for slavery was left untouched, with-
out whom, the evil of slavery could never 
have continued as it did, to such extreme 
that it is necessary to address here in order 
for the U.S. House of Representatives to 
avoid degradation of historical fact and bla-
tant hypocrisy for generations to come; 
Whereas, the Democratic Party Platform 
of 1840, 1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856 states ‘‘That 
Congress has no power under the Constitu-
tion, to interfere with or control the domes-
tic institutions of the several States, and 
that such States are the sole and proper 
judges of everything appertaining to their 
own affairs, not prohibited by the Constitu-
tion; that all efforts of the abolitionists, or 
others, made to induce Congress to interfere 
with questions of slavery . . . are calculated 
to lead to the most alarming and dangerous 
consequences; and that all such efforts have 
an inevitable tendency to diminish the hap-
piness of the people and endanger the sta-
bility and permanency of the Union, and 
ought not to be countenanced by any friend 
of our political institutions.’’; 
Whereas, the Democratic Party Platform 
of 1856 further declares that ‘‘new states’’ to 
the Union should be admitted ‘‘with or with-
out domestic slavery, as [the state] may 
elect.’’; 
Whereas, the Democratic Party Platform 
of 1856 also resolves that ‘‘we recognize the 
right of the people of all the Territories . . . 
to form a Constitution, with or without do-
mestic slavery.’’; 
Whereas, the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 
penalized officials who did not arrest an al-
leged runaway slave and made them liable 
for a fine of $1,000 (about $28,000 in present- 
day value); law-enforcement officials every-
where were required to arrest people sus-
pected of being a runaway slave on as little 
as a claimant’s sworn testimony of owner-
ship; the Democratic Party Platform of 1860 
directly, in seeking to uphold the Fugitive 
Slave Act, states that ‘‘the enactments of 
the State Legislatures to defeat the faithful 
execution of the Fugitive Slave Law are hos-
tile in character, subversive of the Constitu-
tion, and revolutionary in their effect.’’; 
Whereas, the 14th Amendment, giving full 
citizenship to freed slaves, passed in 1868 
with 94 percent Republican support and 0 
percent Democrat support in Congress; the 
15th Amendment, giving freed slaves the 
right to vote, passed in 1870 with 100 percent 
Republican support and 0 percent Democrat 
support in Congress; 
Whereas, Democrats systematically sup-
pressed African-Americans’ right to vote, 
and by specific example in the 1902 Constitu-
tion of the State of Virginia, actually 
disenfranchised about 90 percent of the Black 
men who still voted at the beginning of the 
twentieth century and nearly half of the 
White men, thereby suppressing Republican 
voters; the number of eligible African-Amer-
ican voters were thereby forcibly reduced 
from about 147,000 in 1901 to about 10,000 by 
1905; that measure was supported almost ex-
clusively by Virginia Democrats; 
Whereas, Virginia’s 1902 Constitution was 
engineered by Carter Glass, future Demo-
cratic Party U.S. Representative, Senator, 
and even Secretary of the Treasury under 
Democrat President Woodrow Wilson, who 
proclaimed the goal of the constitutional 
convention as follows: This Democrat ex-
claimed, ‘‘Discrimination! Why, that is pre-
cisely what we propose. That, exactly, is 
what this Convention was elected for—to dis-
criminate to the very extremity of permis-
sible action under the limits of the federal 
Constitution, with a view to the elimination 
of every Negro voter who can be gotten rid of 
legally.’’; 
Whereas, in 1912, Democratic President 
Woodrow Wilson’s administration began a 
racial segregation policy for U.S. govern-
ment employees and, by 1914, the Wilson ad-
ministration’s Civil Service instituted the 
requirement that a photograph be submitted 
with each employment application; 
Whereas, the 1924 Democratic National 
Convention convened in New York City at 
Madison Square Garden; the convention is 
commonly known as the ‘‘Klan-Bake’’ due to 
the overwhelming influence of the Ku Klux 
Klan in the Democratic Party; 
Whereas, Democrat President Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt continued Woodrow Wil-
son’s policy of segregating White House staff 
and maintained separate dining rooms for 
White and Black staffers. He also continued 
the White House Correspondents Associa-
tion’s ban on credentialing Black journalists 
for White House duties until outside pressure 
from Black publications finally forced a 
change in policy in 1944, the last year of his 
presidency. According to the American Jour-
nal of Public Health, prior to his presidency, 
Roosevelt not only banned Blacks from re-
ceiving treatment at his polio facility in 
Warm Springs, Georgia, Black staff were 
forced to live in the basement of the facility 
or in a segregated dormitory while White 
staff lived in the hotel or in surrounding cot-
tages; 
Whereas, Democrat Congressman Howard 
Smith, former chairman of the House Rules 
Committee introduced the ‘‘Declaration of 
Constitutional Principles’’ in a speech on the 
House floor where he attacked the Supreme 
Court’s 1954 decision on Brown v. Board of 
Education of Topeka (KS) which determined 
that segregated public schools were uncon-
stitutional. Smith’s declaration urged people 
to utilize all ‘‘lawful means’’ to avoid the 
‘‘chaos and confusion’’ which would occur if 
they 
desegregated 
schools. 
His-
tory.House.Gov states that ‘‘Under Smith, 
the Rules Committee became a graveyard for

numerous civil rights initiatives in the 
1950s.’’; 
Whereas, in 1964, the Democratic Party led 
a 75-calendar-day filibuster against the 1964 
Civil Rights Act; 
Whereas, leading the Democrats in their 
opposition to civil rights for African-Ameri-
cans was a fellow member of the Democratic 
Party, Senator Robert Byrd from West Vir-
ginia—a known recruiter for the Ku Klux 
Klan; 
Whereas, Democrats enacted and enforced 
Jim Crow laws and civil codes that forced 
segregation and restricted freedoms of Black 
Americans in the United States; and 
Whereas, on June 18, 2020, House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi ordered the removal from the 
Capitol portraits of four previous Speakers 
of the House who served in the Confederacy 
saying that the portraits, ‘‘set back our na-
tion’s work to confront a combat bigotry;’’ 
the men depicted in the portraits were Dem-
ocrat Robert M.T. Hunter, Democrat Howell 
Cobb, Democrat James L. Orr and Democrat 
Charles F. Crisp: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives shall remove any item that 
names, symbolizes, or mentions any political 
organization or party that has ever held a 
public position that supported slavery or the 
Confederacy, from any area within the House 
wing of the Capitol or any House office build-
ing, and shall donate any such item or sym-
bol to the Library of Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution qualifies.

HONORING POLICE CHIEF SCOTT 
HENRY 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, every 
day our men and women in law enforce-
ment put their lives on the line to pro-
tect us, doing so willingly, faithfully, 
and without praise or need of recogni-
tion. Occasionally, however, I have the 
opportunity and the distinct pleasure 
to stand before this Congress and rec-
ognize these men and women for their 
outstanding work. 
Today I am honored to recognize 
Mansfield University Director of Police 
Services and Chief of Police Scott 
Henry for receiving the 2020 Pennsyl-
vania Veterans of Foreign Wars John 
Radko Police Officer of the Year and 
the VFW National Law Enforcement 
Officer Award. These awards are pre-
sented annually to a law enforcement 
officer who has shown resounding com-
mitment to their profession and com-
munity. 
Chief Henry has served our commu-
nity for more than 30 years, and his 
service has made a lasting impact on 
our region. 
Congratulations to Chief Henry for 
this wonderful achievement and re-
minding us all how important our po-
lice officers are in our everyday lives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5038 
September 29, 2020 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is the em-
bodiment of a fierce constitutional 
scholar, and her long list of accom-
plishments is nothing short of impec-
cable. She is highly regarded by her 
former students, clerks, and colleagues 
as a woman who possesses a piercing 
legal mind, a generous spirit, and a 
keen intellect. Her dedication to inter-
preting the Constitution rightfully by 
adhering to how it was expressly writ-
ten and her impressive track record 
serve as the underpinnings of her nomi-
nation. 
I look forward to her swift confirma-
tion to the Supreme Court and her con-
tinued work serving our great country.

b 2015 
IN MEMORY AND HONOR OF 
JOHNATHON GRAYER 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor the life of 25-year-old Johnathon 
Grayer, whose selfless actions led to 
saving the lives of multiple school chil-
dren and a bus driver in the city of 
Alma, Georgia. 
On Wednesday, August 12, Johnathon 
was driving a box truck that collided 
with a school bus that was making its 
normal stops. When it hit the bus, the 
back was left crumpled like a piece of 
paper. However, he remarkably jumped 
out of the truck, rushed onto the bus, 
and helped pull students out of the 
school bus to safety. He even lifted 
some seats off children who were 
pinned underneath. 
Unfortunately, following the inci-
dent, Johnathon’s body gave out, and 
he later passed away in the hospital. 
With the help of his courage and self-
lessness, the lives of 10 children and 
the bus driver were saved. Although 
Johnathon’s life was tragically taken, 
his legacy of sacrifice will live on for 
countless years to come. He will al-
ways be remembered as a hero who 
placed others before himself. His fam-
ily, friends, and all who knew him will 
be in my thoughts and prayers during 
this difficult time. 
f 
CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, just 
over 2 years ago, the Carr fire burned 
through Shasta County, taking the 
lives of eight people and burning nearly 
230,000 acres. 
Now, I am here to report, in the same 
county of Shasta, the Zogg fire has 
broken out over this weekend, burning 
uncontained. As of this morning, 146 
structures have been destroyed, three 
people have lost their lives, over 40,000 
acres burned and counting. 
Cal Fire and Shasta County—with 
the assistance of many other units 
across the State—are working hard to 
extinguish the Zogg fire, but a lack of 
firefighting personnel and equipment 
has made this a difficult one to con-
tain. It is not an unfamiliar story. 
Firefighters, first responders, and 
Californians alike are struggling to 
grapple with the 27 major fires that are 
burning across our State right now. 
With no rain in sight, the end of these 
disasters is not near. There is a dire 
need for a better way to contain these 
fires, or better yet, completely prevent 
them in the first place. 
Until we increase the pace and scale 
of forest management and other tools 
that we use in the West, these never- 
ending fires will continue to destroy all 
of our land. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF SERGEANT 
FIRST CLASS RICHARD STAYSKAL 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, 
this is an amazing story. I hope every-
body will follow it. 
Madam Speaker, I recognize Wound-
ed Warrior Week, sponsored by the 
American Legion Post 469, and Ser-
geant First Class Richard Stayskal, 
United States Army. 
In 2001, Richard joined the United 
States Marines. In 2004, in the Anbar 
province of Iraq, Richard was critically 
wounded 
by 
a 
bullet 
that 
passed 
through his arm and pierced his lung. 
After surgeries, PTSD, and rehab, he 
was honorably discharged from the 
United States Marine Corps. 
But he was not done serving his Na-
tion yet. 
Richard reenlisted in 2006 with the 
U.S. Army and became an elite Green 
Beret. He was both in the Marines and 
in the Army in his lifetime. Richard 
was recently diagnosed with terminal 
lung cancer and is now in the fight of 
his life. 
Richard, you have led a life to be 
emulated. You make me proud to be an 
American. I know you will fight this 
fight, give it hell, and you are going to 
win. God bless you. 
Thank you, Richard. And thank you 
American Legion Post 469 for honoring 
this American hero.

HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH—IN 
HONOR OF AMILCAR CORDOVA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
HAALAND). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor 
Amilcar Cordova. 
Mr. Amilcar Cordova hails from 
Carolina, 
Puerto 
Rico. 
After 
high 
school, he moved to Pennsylvania, 
where he began his career in the health 
insurance industry. In 1994, he relo-
cated to Orlando, Florida, with his 
family while he studied business ad-
ministration at Florida Metropolitan 
University, and later, business manage-
ment at the University of Phoenix. 
In 2003, he began working in the ad-
vertising industry with the largest 
newspaper in Puerto Rico, El Nuevo 
Dia, which just recently expanded to 
Central Florida. He later cofounded 
and served on the board of directors of 
Amigos Profesionales Business Net-
work, an organization whose purpose 
was to help connect Hispanic profes-
sionals and business owners in Central 
Florida. 
In 2010, he founded Cordova Mar-
keting Solutions, a firm that special-
ized in the development of small busi-
nesses by providing consulting, mar-
keting, and advertising services. Dur-
ing this time, he joined the Puerto 
Rican Chamber of Commerce of Central 
Florida as its executive director, and in 
2013, was elected as their President 
until the end of his term in 2016. He 
would resume his role as President in 
2019. 
Mr. Cordova is proud of his upbring-
ing in Puerto Rico and is very grateful 
for the opportunities the U.S. has 
blessed him with. He tries to give back 
to his community through volunteer 
work, including riding his bicycle for 
different charities. One especially close 
to his heart is the Young Survival Coa-
lition, an organization dedicated to 
providing essential services for breast 
cancer survivors under the age of 40. 
Mr. Cordova shares his life with his 
best friend, Ms. Milly Colon. He has 
two sons, four grandchildren, and is 
blessed to still have both his parents 
alive and well. 
For that, Mr. Cordova, we honor you. 
IN HONOR OF CECILIA FIGUEROA 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Hispanic Heritage Month, we honor 
Cecilia Figueroa. Cecilia Figueroa is an 
Ecuadorian-American 
journalist 
and 
media strategist. She graduated as a 
journalist 
in 
her 
native 
city 
of 
Guayaquil, Ecuador. She learned about 
faith, perseverance, and serving others 
from her parents, Isaac Alvia and 
Olimpia Ordonez. 
A woman pioneer in the print His-
panic media, her first job was at El 
Nuevo Dia an Orlando newspaper. Pas-
sionate about her work, she seeks sto-
ries promoting community outreach, 
education and knowledge about immi-
gration policies that are affecting the 
Latino community. 
Cecilia enjoys highlighting profiles of 
Hispanic entrepreneurs, organizations, 
and faith-based communities, among 
others. She was the producer of the 
radio show, Hispanos Al Dia, and was 
cohost in various other radio programs. 
She has provided professional services 
to EFE News Service, El Sentinel de 
Orlando newspaper, and many others. 
In 
2018, 
she 
cofounded 
Conexion 
Hispana USA, where she was a jour-
nalist and social media manager for 
the platform.

IN HONOR OF ILUMINADA APONTE 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Hispanic Heritage Month, I recog-
nize Iluminada Aponte. 
Iluminada Aponte was born in Santo 
Domingo, Dominican Republic, and has 
called the United States home for over 
six decades. Iluminada is a self-taught 
folk artist whose career has taken her 
first to Puerto Rico and then Florida. 
Iluminada’s career first started with 
folk dance—Baile Folklorico. She per-
forms both Puerto Rican and Domini-
can folk dance. From Puerto Rican 
bomba 
to 
Dominican 
bachata, 
Iluminada has not only been a per-
former, but also a dance teacher. Her 
passion for teaching folk dance inspires 
people of all ages, and she has made it 
her responsibility to advocate for and 
help educate various Hispanic groups 
through dance and cultural exhibi-
tions. 
Iluminada’s career has been one of 
strengthening 
communities 
through 
cultural celebrations. She considers 
herself a cultural ambassador, not only 
for her native Dominican Republic, but 
also for the entire Hispanic commu-
nity. Her early experience as a mis-
sionary across Latin America has in-
spired her to connect people to each 
other by celebrating cultural diversity. 
Iluminada’s 
commitment 
to 
pro-
moting culture and the arts is not only 
seen in the diversity of her works but 
also in her leadership within the com-
munity. Iluminada is the founder of 
Alianza Dominicana of Central Florida, 
where she organizes and directs various 
cultural exhibitions highlighting Do-
minican and Hispanic culture to var-
ious groups within Central Florida. She 
has been recognized with awards from 
the Orange County government, the 
City of Orlando government, the Coun-
sel General of the Dominican Republic 
in Miami, and more. 
For that, Ms. Iluminada Aponte, we 
honor you. 
IN HONOR OF FATHER JOSE RODRIGUEZ 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Hispanic Heritage Month, I recog-
nize Father Jose Rodriguez. 
Father Jose Rodriguez is a vicar of 
the Iglesia Episcopal Jesus de Nazaret 
in Orange County, Florida. 
Originally from Puerto Rico, he ar-
rived with his family to Azalea Park in 
1987 and has been part of that commu-
nity now for over three decades. 
He learned from his parents the im-
portance of service and advocating for 
others. His father was a soldier, and his 
mother, a shop steward for UNITE 
HERE Local 737 at Walt Disney World. 
He was the first in his family to go to 
college. He graduated from Rollins Col-
lege with a BA and the University of 
Central Florida with an MBA. For 
many years, he served as the Episcopal 
chaplain to the University of Central 
Florida, where he and his wife served 
local students and young adults for 
nearly a decade. 
In 2017, he was assigned to Iglesia 
Episcopal 
Jesus 
de 
Nazaret, 
just 
months before Hurricanes Irma and 
Maria. For both storms, the local 
church mobilized to meet the people’s 
needs. Their work is far from over. 
Welcoming newcomers has been a 
hallmark of the local Episcopal Church 
along the Semoran Corridor in Orlando 
and Kissimmee, including feeding pro-
grams, advocacy for those in need as 
well. Father Jose and the local church 
empower people to accomplish their 
goals by working with civic and elected 
leaders to promote and remove barriers 
to equal access to opportunity. 
As a priest, Father Jose understands 
the unique role that religious commu-
nities can play in the development of 
the greater community. Preserving and 
upholding human dignity is at the 
heart of Father Jose and the local 
church’s work. His desire is to build up 
a resilient community where families 
have access to safe communities, a liv-
ing 
wage, 
affordable 
housing, 
and 
healthcare. 
For that, Father Jose Rodriguez, we 
honor you.

IN HONOR OF JOSE RODRIGUEZ 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Hispanic Heritage Month, I would 
like to recognize Jose Rodriguez. 
Jose Rodriguez arrived in Palmetto, 
Florida, at the age of 12 from El Sal-
vador. While attending school, he re-
calls being pulled out of regular class 
for 2 hours a day to practice English. 
During his first 5 years in the United 
States, Mr. Rodriguez and his family 
were migrant farmworkers, living 9 
months in Florida and 3 months up 
north, following the crops with the 
help of the Summer Migrant Institute 
held in Tampa at the University of 
South Florida. 
Mr. Rodriguez graduated early from 
high school, in the top 10 percent of his 
class. He was the first Hispanic person 
in Manatee County to be accepted into 
a 4-year university, where he earned 
his associate’s degree. 
Mr. Rodriguez has worked as a gen-
eral manager and on-air personality for 
La Que Buena, a regional Mexican 
radio station in Orlando. As part of his 
work, he makes sure to give airtime to 
nonprofit organizations and elected of-

community. While sharing his passion 
for music with his listeners, Mr. Rodri-
guez always keeps central Floridians 
informed on community resources like 
food 
drives,

sites, 
and 
much 
more. 
Mr. Rodriguez also serves on the 
leadership committee of the Farm-
workers Association of Florida. He 
draws his inspiration from his commu-
nity, his two beautiful daughters, and 
his late wife. 
For that, Mr. Jose Rodriguez, we 
honor you. 
IN HONOR OF DR. ANTONIO CRESPO 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Hispanic Heritage Month, I would 
like to recognize Dr. Antonio Crespo. 
Dr. Antonio Crespo is an infectious 
disease specialist in central Florida 
with over 18 years of experience in his 
field. In May of 2014, he led the team 
that cared for the second case of Mid-
dle 
Eastern 
respiratory 
syndrome, 
MERS, in the United States. Currently, 
he is part of the team that has pre-
pared and managed the COVID–19 pan-
demic, helping many in the Orlando 
community. 
He first earned his medical degree 
from Universidad Central de Venezuela 
and later moved to the United States 
to continue his education. He com-
pleted his residency at Albert Einstein 
Medical Center and infectious disease 
training at Temple University, both in 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
Since 2002, he has been part of the in-

new generations has inspired many on 
the path of infectious diseases so that 
more doctors might continue the fight 
against these elusive enemies. 
For that, Dr. Antonio Crespo, we 
honor you. 
IN HONOR OF PAMELA AND ESTELA JUAREZ 
Mr. SOTO. In honor of Hispanic Her-
itage Month, I would like to recognize 
Pamela and Estela Juarez. 
For nearly 20 years, Cuauhtemoc 
‘‘Temo’’ Juarez and his wife, Alejandra 
Juarez, worked together to build and 
sustain their American Dream in Polk 
County, Florida. 
Mr. Juarez, a naturalized U.S. cit-
izen, grew up in Osceola County and 
enlisted in the United States Marine 
Corps right after graduating from high 
school. He would later reenlist in the 
United States Army Reserve. 
After his honorable discharge from 
the Marines, he came home, started his 
own flooring business, and met and 
married Mrs. Alejandra Juarez. To-
gether, they worked hard to make 
their business a success. They built a 
home, joined a church, volunteered to 
help the less fortunate, and had two 
beautiful 
daughters, 
Pamela 
and 
Estela. 
Two years ago, their dreams were 
shattered when Mrs. Juarez was de-
ported under the current administra-
tion’s zero-tolerance policy. Despite 
the roots she set up, despite her hus-
band’s brave and honorable service, de-
spite the fact that her husband and two

daughters are U.S. citizens, she was 
forced to return to Mexico in August of 
2018. 
Pamela is now 18. She recently grad-
uated from high school with honors, 
has started online college classes, and 
plans to become a social worker. She 
has campaigned to build grassroots 
support for the families of military 
veterans who, like hers, have lost a 
family member to a cruel immigration 
policy. This November, she will vote 
for the first time. 
Estela, 11 years old, lived with her 
mom in Mexico but is now back in 
Florida, where she just started the 
sixth grade. She is following in the 
footsteps of civil rights leader John 
Lewis, whose book ‘‘March’’ inspired 
her. Estela is now working on a picture 
book about her struggle to reunite her 
family. 
Both young women have suffered 
enormously because of the trauma 
their family has endured. They and 
their family have been working hard to 
bring their mother home and will con-
tinue to do so until they are united 
again. 
For that, Pamela and Estela Juarez, 
we honor you. 
IN SUPPORT OF THE DIGITAL TAXONOMY ACT 
AND THE BLOCKCHAIN INNOVATION ACT 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, today, I 
am pleased that the House passed, as 
part of the Consumer Safety Inspection 
Enhancement Act, two pieces of legis-
lation that we were able to offer in the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, the 
Digital Taxonomy Act, H.R. 2154, and 
the Blockchain Innovation Act, H.R. 
8153. 
We were very pleased to work in a bi-
partisan fashion to secure the inclusion 
of these two bills. Both bills will study 
and highlight the consumer protection 
aspects of blockchain technology and 
digital assets. They are the first 
blockchain bills to pass the House. 
H.R. 8153, the Blockchain Innovation 
Act, directs the Department of Com-
merce, in consultation with the Fed-
eral Trade Commission, to conduct a 
study and submit to the Congress a re-
port on the state of blockchain tech-
nology in commerce, including its use 
to reduce fraud and increase security. 
It is setting up a larger long-term goal 
that we have to establish a blockchain 
center of excellence within the Com-
merce Department. 
Blockchain has enormous potential 
for innovation and economic growth. I 
believe, as government officials, we 
need to support that growth and enable 
its appropriate use for government 
business and consumers. We will con-
tinue to push until we have these pol-
icy objectives put into law with proper 
regulations so we can best position 
ourselves to be leaders in this space, 
especially when we see rivals like 
China and Russia pushing in these 
technologies. 
The Digital Taxonomy Act requires 
the FCC to submit a report to Congress 
about recommendations on unfair and 
deceptive trade practices and other 
practices related to digital tokens. 
b 2045 
Specifically, the report asked the 
FTC to make legislative recommenda-
tions for how to further protect con-
sumers and promotion and innovation 
in the global digital token sector. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with our colleagues, both in the Energy 
and 
Commerce 
Committee 
and 
throughout the Congress, to help make 
sure we keep a competitive edge in 
blockchain for both digital security 
and for cryptocurrency and to enhance 
the use of artificial intelligence in the 
future. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank Chairman PALLONE, Chairwoman 
SCHAKOWSKY, Representative MCNER-
NEY, and the committee for allowing 
me to incorporate these two bills. 
We appreciate Representative ROD-
GERS, 
Representative 
GUTHRIE, 
and 
Representative MATSUI, as well as our 
original cosponsor, Representative DA-
VIDSON, for all of their hard work. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JOHN SHIMKUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the subject of 
this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, tonight we are 
going to spend the next hour paying 
tribute to a special man who has served 
here in this Congress since 1997, our 
dear friend, Congressman JOHN SHIM-
KUS. 
JOHN came to Congress back at a 
time 
when 
you 
saw 
a 
lot 
more 
collegiality. In fact, Madam Speaker, 
tonight 
we 
have 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats on this floor who are going 
to be talking about JOHN SHIMKUS, the 
man; JOHN SHIMKUS, our friend; JOHN 
SHIMKUS, the legislator, somebody who, 
when he retires, will have a proud 
record of achievement showing how he 
made his mark on this great Nation. 
We are joined in this House Chamber 
tonight by JOHN’s lovely wife, Karen, 
who is here tonight. His son, Josh, is 
not far from the Chamber. We have 
many friends, and I know we have a 
limited amount of time. 
First, Madam Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG), 
the dean of the House. 
Mr. 
YOUNG. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the leader for yielding. 
JOHN SHIMKUS has been my friend. He 
has done well for this House. 
He and I played paddleball together. 
We never lost. We will be challenged on 
that, but that is true. 
I have a saying that many people 
may not recognize. Why do the good 
people leave this Congress and the 
SOBs stay behind? I have been here 48 
years, so I have to reconsider that. 
But, JOHN, we will miss you. You are 
a great Congressman; you are a great 
ally; you are a great American; and I 
know you have served your district 
very well. God bless you in the future 
for things you may do. 
Mr. SCALISE. Thank you, DEAN 
YOUNG. We are going to check that 
record. I know I am glad I never went 
up against you, although you have 
taken a few of us to the woodshed. 
Madam Speaker, keeping with the bi-
partisan tradition, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCNER-
NEY), our friend on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the whip for the opportunity to 
say some words here. 
Madam Speaker, my first impression 
of JOHN was pretty scary. It was my 
first day on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, and JOHN was in the top 
dais, and I was down in front, a little 
freshman. JOHN looked down on us and 
said: Your policies in the Democratic 
Party are going to cost you your seat. 
I looked back. ‘‘Oh, geez, I hope he is 
not looking at me.’’ He was, but we got 
over it. 
It is funny, when the climate change 
issue came up, JOHN had a standard 
practice. He would bring out this big 
picture of his coal mine workers, and 
say: You guys, climate policy is going 
to cost these people their jobs. 
That is a hard argument to fight 
against. That is a hard argument be-
cause you know he is fighting for his 
people. I know there are other people 
here who are shaking their heads on 
that one, but I respected that. He was 
fighting for the people he cared about 
and the people he represented. 
But there were some things JOHN and 
I had in common. We both played 
paddleball, and we were pretty evenly 
matched, so we got some good games in 
there. The great thing about that is 
that you get to know people who you 
wouldn’t otherwise get to know, and 
that was important. I think that is a 
tradition that we need to carry on. 
We also both went to West Point, so 
we had that little bit in common, and 
it was fun to talk about that. 
Eventually, we started talking about 
policy. One day, I asked Henry Wax-
man: What about JOHN SHIMKUS? 
Henry said: He is a nice guy, JERRY. 
Then he frowned, and he said: But he 
sure is conservative. 
That is coming from Henry Waxman, 
so I don’t know if that means anything 
or not. 
JOHN and I started talking about nu-
clear waste and policy. He took me to 
Yucca Mountain. It is pretty impres-
sive, but it is totally shut down.

September 29, 2020 
Sorry to tell you, JOHN, it ain’t going 
to happen, as much as we would like it 
to. 
I even talked to Dean Heller about it, 
and Dean Heller said: Oh, JOHN SHIM-
KUS, people in Nevada think of him as 
Darth Vader. 
Later, it was suggested that the 
Democrats and the Republicans sit to-
gether during the State of the Union, 
and that is cool. JOHN and I sat to-
gether. I have to tell you, it is weird 
when the President is in the other 
party, and you are sitting with that 
party. Everyone stands up and cheers, 
and you are sitting on your hands. 
We got through that. We still play 
paddleball occasionally. 
I think as time went on, we got to be 
friends, and we talked a lot. I can tell 
you, JOHN has made an impression on 
me. He stands up for what he believes 
in. We need more people like that, that 
have strong beliefs. They are willing to 
fight for what they believe in but are 
also willing to compromise and work 
with the other side to make progress 
happen. 
That is what we need in this institu-
tion. I respect JOHN for that. 
We will miss having him here, but we 
will find somebody else. 
Mr. SCALISE. With that warm trib-
ute, Madam Speaker, clearly, we work 
well together. We have a comity with 
each other. You have to keep your san-
ity around here by keeping things 
lighthearted in the middle of a lot of 
heated battles sometimes. But in the 
meantime, when you think about the 
friendships—and I will share my story 
about JOHN shortly. 
There is a townhouse that JOHN 
SHIMKUS
owns here in Washington, 
D.C., and it is a four-bedroom town-
house. There are four Members of Con-
gress who live in that townhouse. We 
each have our own bedrooms and bath-
rooms, but we come together. It has 
been, I think, a special part of all of 
our times up here in Congress to get to 
know each other so well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY), the 
Member of Congress who has lived in 
the townhouse with JOHN the longest, 
probably going back to when he pur-
chased it, our dear friend, colleague, 
and roommate. 
Mr. 
BRADY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the whip for organizing the Spe-
cial Order. 
Remind me never to have Congress-
man MCNERNEY
do my eulogy. The 
crowd would never believe it. 
Madam Speaker, we are here to 
honor a remarkable man, a classmate, 
and a friend of mine for 24 years. 
We all know, in Washington and 
across the country, his leadership and 
energy for the Energy and Commerce 
Committee and his leadership in the 
Environment and Climate Change Sub-
committee. But you may not know his 
achievements in the heart. 
He is committed to the Baltic States, 
in developing and enhancing that rela-
tionship with the U.S.; his many years 
of service on the NATO Parliamentary 
Assembly, traveling back and forth to 
Europe to lay out and preserve that 
important relationship; his role serving 
on the Smithsonian Institution Board 
of Regents; and his service on the West 
Point Board of Governors. He has an 
amazing legacy for our country. 
He has worked with colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to achieve things 
that matter to real people. His 1998 bill 
signed into law, allowing for biofuel 
use in Federal, State, and private 
fleets, has made biodiesel more readily 
available at fuel pumps across the 
country. 
He is always focused on making sure 
911 worked for the American people. In 
1999, he designated 911 as the universal 
emergency number in the U.S. for mo-
bile as well as landline telephones and 
continues to improve on that for our 
safety and security. 
He led the bill to require Federal 
testing of children’s booster seats, 
something every parent can take to 
heart. 
Following that, he created a new 
internet domain, a place where chil-
dren could go that was safe and secure 
from predators. It was game-changing. 
His 2003 law created a placement for 
heart defibrillators in schools. 
You can see a theme here: helping 
real people, helping children, helping 
families. 
He 
continued 
that 
work 
throughout his years on the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. 
I can go on and on, but he took on 
tough issues as well, ones that people 
never thought could be solved, like the 
Toxic Substance Control Act, some-
thing he worked years for, to build bi-
partisan 
support, 
something 
that 
makes our Nation more secure environ-
mentally as well. 
We all know, since we have nick-
named him Yucca SHIMKUS for many 
years, his devotion to trying to find a 
safe, secure nuclear energy future for 
America. 
He didn’t do this by himself. He has 
an amazing family. His wife, Karen, as 
STEVE said, is here today. His three 
sons, David, Josh, and Daniel, who we 
watched growing up reading in the 
townhouse, backing their dad. 
His heart is never far away from his 
hometown of Collinsville, Illinois. He 
is, as you know, a proud graduate of 
the United States Military Academy. 
He served over 5 years Active Duty in 
the Army and then entered the Army 
Reserves. He retired with the rank of 
lieutenant colonel. 
After 28 years of military service, I 
can tell you, because I was his room-
mate, when we finished long days at 
the Capitol, trying to figure out how 
we get ready for the next day, John 
was leaving to go to a Reserve training 
and continuing education, or the week-
ends on his training as well. He has a 
devotion to this country that is unbe-
lievable. 
His service has not just been to his 
country but to his community. He ran 
and won his first election for the 
school township trustees because he 
wanted to help children in his commu-
nity. He was elected as Madison Coun-
ty treasurer so he could serve a broader 
group of constituents. 
In 1996, he won his first term in the 
United States House from Illinois’ 20th 
District. Today, he represents the 33 
counties of the 15th District. 
I can tell you, it must be an amazing 
district because we all know where the 
largest ketchup bottle in America is 
located: Collinsville, Illinois. We know 
his district is the horseradish capital of 
the 
world, 
with 
the 
International 
Horseradish Festival, horseradish food, 
horseradish fun. 
I will tell you, he loves his Lord. He 
loves his family. He has always fretted 
about how much more he can do to 
help our church, the Holy Cross Lu-
theran Church, in which he has wor-
shiped his entire life. 
Two points, as we finish, for me. 
You would love being his roommate. 
He is a man of integrity, of character. 
He is, every morning, the first one up 
in the morning, sitting at the kitchen 
table reading the Bible, sending out 
those Bible phrases for his friends and 
colleagues in preparing for his day. 
He is an amazing teammate, along 
with classmate and roommate. He and 
I played in the Congressional Baseball 
Game now for 23 straight years. He is a 
baseball player. He has won MVP four 
or five times. We have lost count. He is 
the last Member of Congress to hit a 
home run out of the field, out of the 
park, on his first to bat in the first 
year in Congress. He has never hit the 
ball anywhere close ever since. 
He was a catcher, a pitcher, and the 
captain of our team, which doesn’t sur-
prise you. He has been the captain of 
everything he has been involved with 
his entire life. With this, I will tell how 
remarkable, how gutsy, this guy is. 
In 2004 or so, he had open-heart sur-
gery in the spring, which, of course, 
would mean he would miss his favorite 
baseball game. We had the Congres-
sional Baseball Game, and the doctor 
told him he could begin to start exer-
cising 3 months after the surgery. Well, 
the baseball game happened to be ex-
actly 3 months after the surgery. 
Another pitcher started the game, 
was called back to Congress for votes 
in the Senate, and out of the bullpen 
came JOHN SHIMKUS, 3 months after 
heart surgery, not arthroscopic sur-
gery, the kind that cracks you open. 
b 2100 
There he was, three up, three down, 
helping save the game for the Repub-
licans. That is the kind of lawmaker, 
that is the kind of friend, that is the 
kind of competitor he is. JOHN is never 
letting you down. 
He has always upheld the highest 
standards for our country, for Con-
gress, and I will tell you, at a time 
where each day you are told what is 
wrong with America, JOHN SHIMKUS is 
what is right with America. We are so 
proud of our friend’s service, and he 
will be missed like nobody else.

H5043 
September 29, 2020 
God bless you, JOHN. Thank you. 
Mr. 
SCALISE. 
As 
you 
can 
see, 
Madam Speaker, these are tough jobs, 
these are tough times, but when you 
come up to Congress, you don’t just 
come up here to fight for the things 
you believe in. That is clearly why you 
run. We all have a deep love for this 
country. We all have a deep set of be-
liefs that we come to try to advocate 
for. But we all know, in a job like this, 
you can’t do it alone. You need to work 
with other people. You need to find al-
lies, people who want to help join you 
in that cause to advance the things you 
believe in. And along that way, Madam 
Speaker, you truly do make deep 
friendships. 
I remember, I was a new Member in a 
special election. I came in towards the 
tail end of a Congress in 2008 with only 
6 months left in the term. I didn’t real-
ly know anybody here. I was trying to 
find my way, in fact, trying to find a 
place to live. I was living with one of 
my college roommates who works up 
here in D.C. They had a baby on the 
way, and I was staying in the baby’s 
room, so I knew I had a few weeks left 
before I had to find another place to 
live. 
So I asked my colleague right over 
there, I asked Jim McCrery, the Con-
gressman from Louisiana, I said: Jim, I 
am looking for a place. What do you do 
to find a place around here? 
He said: Well, you know, JOHN SHIM-
KUS has an opening at his town house. 
I said: Who is JOHN SHIMKUS? 
I didn’t know JOHN. And he literally 
pointed, and JOHN was right there in 
the well of the House during a vote se-
ries. So all the Members of Congress 
were joined together, and he points 
JOHN out. 
I walked down, and I introduced my-
self to JOHN. I said: I heard you have an 
opening at your town house. I just 
came here, and I am looking for a place 
to stay. 
He said: Why don’t you come by later 
tonight. 
And that, Madam Speaker, started an 
incredible friendship. 
That next day, I called my wife, Jen-
nifer, that night and I said: I think I 
found a place to live.’’ 
That next day I moved in. I didn’t 
really know KEVIN BRADY, and next 
thing you know, I am rooming with 
these gentlemen and getting to know 
people who became dear friends. 
And again, in a job like this, you 
work really hard advocating for the 
things that you ran on back home. You 
are fighting for the people in your dis-
trict. I am honored to represent south-
east Louisiana. But you are also work-
ing with some incredible people, and 
you get to meet incredible people along 
the way. JOHN SHIMKUS is truly, as 
KEVIN said, one of those true, genuine 
people, somebody you can entrust the 
things that you want to share with 
only a few people. 
Close friendships do form up here. 
You don’t hear about that a lot, yet we 
were able to form such a deep friend-
ship, somebody you can trust. 
As KEVIN said, JOHN went to West 
Point. He is an Army guy, so he was 
the drill sergeant in the town house. 
And when JOHN says something, you 
back your brother’s play. 
In fact, the second day I was in the 
town house, JOHN said: Steve, tomor-
row you have got to get up at 6 in the 
morning, and we are going out to play 
baseball. 
I didn’t know about the tradition be-
tween the Democrats and Republicans. 
I guess I have JOHN to blame. 
JOHN said: You have got to come out 
for the baseball team. 
I hadn’t played baseball in over 25 
years. I didn’t even have a glove, and 
yet, next thing you know, the next 
morning I am up playing baseball. And, 
boy, what a start of, again, an ability 
to generate even more friendships, to 
forge friendships with people on both 
sides of the aisle, some that you work 
with on a regular basis, some that you 
are not always working with, but peo-
ple you get to form a deep friendship 
with. 
And that is really what makes Con-
gress work. It is not the things that 
you see on the nightly news, the big 
fights that go on between the parties 
and sometimes within the parties, but 
it is the day-to-day grind where people 
do come together and find common 
ground to advance the things that they 
believe in to make this a greater na-
tion. And JOHN SHIMKUS has done that 
on so many fronts. I got to see it. 
Yes, he is the first one up. He is read-
ing his Bible. He is writing down 
verses. But when it is time to leave, he 
starts to whistle. And you don’t need 
an alarm clock. When JOHN starts to 
whistle, that means it is time to go to 
work. 
And, again, he is just a person who 
wakes up and goes to work for the peo-
ple of southern Illinois and the United 
States of America, just like he served 
our country in the military. For 24 
years, he served this great Nation. 
We are a better nation because JOHN 
SHIMKUS has been a Member of this 
wonderful body, the people’s House. 
This is really where people come to-
gether. 
I started this morning in Philadel-
phia. I had some meetings there, and I 
actually, on my way out, passed by 
Independence Hall. You never can see 
that enough. I got to see the Liberty 
Bell this morning. I got to go see the 
chamber where George Washington sat 
as they signed the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, where they wrote the Con-
stitution of the United States, right 
next door, the chamber where Congress 
met for 10 years when they were build-
ing this beautiful building, where they 
actually passed the Bill of Rights. 
We are all honored to be a part of 
this special place where people of all 
walks of life come together. And you 
meet people of different backgrounds, 
you work with people of different back-
grounds, and you work to make this a 
better country. And you just hope, you 
just pray, as you are praying to God for 
strength, for wisdom, for guidance, as 
we all do, that whenever you leave—we 
all leave this job; hopefully, you leave 
on your own terms—if you look back, 
you can say that you left your mark, 
you made this a better country. 
JOHN SHIMKUS, you left your mark. 
You get to leave on your own terms. 
You get to go home with Karen and 
enjoy your life in southern Illinois. 
You have earned this opportunity to 
have a new chapter in your life because 
you can look back and say, for 24 
years, you served here in this great 
body and made this a better institution 
and made this a better country because 
of your service. 
Thank you, JOHN, for this oppor-
tunity to get to know you so well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, al-
though I was unable to join in person tonight, 
I want to lend my voice to the chorus of col-
leagues assembling to honor JOHN SHIMKUS’ 
service in Congress. I thank JOHN for his 
friendship, and commitment to public service. 
I wish him nothing but health and happiness 
for himself and his family during his upcoming 
retirement from Congress. 
JOHN came to Washington one term before 
I did. We had offices next to each other on the 
fifth floor of the Cannon Building. As most 
members and staff know, most of the ele-
vators in Cannon do not go to the fifth floor, 
making those offices not the most desirable 
real estate. But JOHN and I not only stayed 
there as Freshman members, but we stayed a 
few terms, enjoying the larger offices and the 
somewhat quieter halls. JOHN and I, as well as 
our staff, got along well, especially Cathy 
Hurwit, my long time Chief of Staff and Craig 
Roberts, JOHN’s then and current Chief. 
Though there were issues on which JOHN 
and I disagreed, we had the opportunity to 
work closely together on issues affecting our 
state. The Illinois Delegation had a tradition of 
monthly bipartisan lunches. The agendas fo-
cused on issues specific to Illinois. Often we 
would agree to support legislation, funding or 
projects that could help all our constituents 
and benefit our state. Illinois was one of the 
few delegations that was able to work so 
smoothly together, and JOHN was a leader in 
that effort. 
JOHN and I both earned positions on the 
prestigious Energy and Commerce Committee. 
I saw up close how passionately JOHN fought 
for his beliefs and constituents. His tone was 
always positive, even as he disagreed with 
other members. I have enjoyed serving with 
him on the Committee all these years. 
JOHN SHIMKUS is well liked on both sides of 
the aisle. Why? Because JOHN SHIMKUS is a 
kind man, a smart man, and a gentleman. We 
have been able to debate without spite, col-
laborate, and sometimes find common ground. 
This is how collegiality and compromise work, 
and I wish we could bottle it and send it 
around the halls of Congress. 
JOHN will be missed here. I hope he enjoys 
every extra moment he’s earned with Karen, 
David, Joshua, and Daniel.

gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY 
DAVIS) for the remainder of the hour as 
the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, at this point, I will go 
over to the other side of the aisle to 
yield to my friend, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TONKO) to offer his com-
ments. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
JOHN, it is an honor and pleasure to 
be here with our colleagues to salute 
you and thank you for the tremendous 
service that you have provided not 
only to people of your congressional 
district, but the people of this Nation. 
It is very obvious that you are much 
loved and appreciated and respected by 
your colleagues in this House. It is also 
humbling to know that you have 
brought a good name to politics, and 
you have reminded us by your very ac-
tions and your deeply rooted beliefs in 
the various issues that you tackle that 
it is not only okay, but it is essential 
to have differences in this House; and 
it is to share those differences in a re-
spectable way, which you have always 
done so as to build the best product. 
So I think this evening we salute 
your integrity and your humility, 
which oftentimes is what I think drives 
your personality to be able to achieve 
and to have this driving force to ac-
complish on behalf of the people. I ap-
preciate the opportunity to participate 
this evening, and I will try not to un-
dermine JOHN SHIMKUS’ sterling con-
servative credentials by joining in this 
discussion this evening. 
For 6 years, I have served as the 
ranking member to Mr. SHIMKUS’ sub-
committee chair. In the past 2 years, 
we have switched roles. But during all 
of that time, we have disagreed on 
many occasions. In fact, we are dis-
agreeing right now, but that doesn’t 
stop me from coming here this evening 
to just share my respect with others 
for you and the tremendous perform-
ance you have put forth on behalf of 
the Republic. 
But as I have found, you have been 
tremendously accessible, very open- 
minded and fair, always looking for a 
way for us to achieve and to build that 
compromise. It has been a great part-
nership, even if we didn’t see eye to eye 
on everything. 
I will always appreciate that we 
would work together to try to find 
common ground on issues where we 
thought we could agree. I am proud of 
our bipartisan work on brownfields, 
where we reauthorized and improved 
that program. Certainly, the drinking 
water infrastructure efforts that we 
made is essential for our communities. 
We made some great improvements to 
both of those programs, and it would 
not have been possible without your 
leadership, JOHN. 
And while we have had some different 
perspectives on TSCA, I believe it is 
fair to say that Representative SHIM-
KUS has done some undeniably monu-
mental work on chemical safety for 
this country. 
His district and this Chamber are los-
ing a great Representative, and Yucca 
Mountain is losing a frequent visitor. 
JOHN, I congratulate you on your re-
tirement. I wish you and Karen the 
very best as you go forward. You have 
displayed to me tremendous qualities 
of character when you speak of your 
family, the love you have for them. It 
is just apparent in your face when you 
talk about them. You are so proud of 
that partnership you have with Karen 
and of the children, the offspring that 
you have created. 
It is also very evident that you have 
enjoyed service to this country, not 
only in this House, but as a member of 
the New York delegation, I am proud 
to say that we adopt you as a West 
Point cadet and that you have shown 
your strength and your valor and your 
courage to be a strong element that 
you have contributed to this country. 
I thank you for your integrity. I 
thank you for your deeply rooted faith 
that has made a lot of our partnership 
work. You are guided with that humble 
spirit to serve your Creator through 
the gifts you have been endowed. 
Thank you for being such a great 
friend, thank you for being such a 
great work partner, and thank you for 
the success that we have achieved to-
gether, and I hope there is more to 
come in the ensuing days and weeks 
that you will be here. 
So, congratulations, my friend. Know 
that you made your mark and that you 
have earned many stars after your 
name. 
God bless. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Thank you, Mr. TONKO, for your com-
ments. I felt a little JOHN SHIMKUS-y 
here. I was getting a little impatient. I 
thought we were running out of time. 
So I am going ask my colleagues to 
please try to limit your comments to a 
maximum of 2 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD), my 
good friend and fellow Illinoisan. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Thank you, Congress-
man DAVIS, for yielding. 
It is a pleasure to be here tonight 
with my colleagues to honor JOHN 
SHIMKUS. I obviously echo the remarks 
of everyone who spoke before me. 
We have heard about JOHN’s service, 
obviously his service at West Point and 
his service to the Army, 28 years serv-
ing us in the military, retiring as a 
lieutenant colonel. But as the newest 
member of the Republican delegation, 
coming in 5 years ago, I just want to 
comment on what JOHN SHIMKUS has 
meant to me as a new Member coming 
in on a special election in September of 
2015. 
JOHN is the head of our delegation, 
was there for me, as he has been for so 
many of us here in the Congress. 
JOHN’s friendship, his mentorship, his 
example that he has set for us has been 
invaluable. He really has set the gold 
standard for being a legislator, and my 
colleagues have talked about that. 
He showed the importance of good 
constituent service, being a cheer-
leader for your district, and making 
the Federal Government work for the 
people that you represent. JOHN has 
been in Congress for all the right rea-
sons and, as has been articulated by 
my colleagues, shown how much he 
cares for his family, his faith, and the 
constituents he represents in southern 
Illinois. 
JOHN, you are going to leave an indel-
ible mark here in the Congress on the 
work you did on the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee and in the peo-
ple’s House here. Illinois and this coun-
try owe you a sincere thanks for your 
selfless service, not only to Congress, 
but to the Army. 
b 2115 
We will miss you in the Illinois dele-
gation, but we know that Karen and 
your three sons will be happy to have 
you home. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to men-
tion, putting Congressman DAVIS aside, 
JOHN has hired very good staff in his 
time in Congress, and I mean that. If 
you look at the people that have 
worked for JOHN SHIMKUS that have 
come through his organization, they 
are people that have gone on to do 
great things back in Illinois and here 
in Washington, D.C., and that is an-
other testament to JOHN SHIMKUS and 
his team. 
Madam Speaker, I have to give a 
shout out to Craig Roberts, his long- 
time staffer. He and JOHN have done a 
remarkable job leading this delegation 
and doing so much for their district 
and the people of Illinois. 
So, JOHN, I want to congratulate you 
on a well-earned retirement and thank 
you for everything you have done for 
me and our country, and Congress is a 
better place because of your service. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman 
LAHOOD for his comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), my 
colleague, who has known JOHN SHIM-
KUS since before he was even elected. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mr. DAVIS for yielding. 
You know, that is true, I have known 
JOHN SHIMKUS since he was actually a 
treasurer in Madison County, where he 
was the one that held the spot after it 
had been 10 years since a Republican 
had held the spot, and he took that. 
I was a State legislator, and I kept 
hearing about this guy, JOHN SHIMKUS 
from Madison County. I actually came 
to know him as I ran for State rep-
resentative. And then all of a sudden, 
they said he is going to run for Con-
gress, and I thought, what a wonderful 
thing. 
You know, each one of us in our dis-
tricts when we see that and as we are 
local elected officials, we think, oh, 
that is going to be good, but we didn’t 
realize how great it would be. 
At this time, when we would like to 
joke with JOHN because we love him, 
the reality is he has served his district 
well. He hasn’t just served his district

well. He has served the State well, he 
has served the Nation well, and he has 
made differences in the world. 
I would like to harass him about the 
fact that he is an Army guy, as a Ma-
rine, but the reality is that he served 
well in the Army as well. 
He is a man of integrity. He is a man 
of faith. He loves his family. And, real-
ly, that is what our Nation is about. 
He is going to be missed terribly in 
this body. 
We want to joke about the fact that 
he is quitting. But you know what? He 
didn’t quit. He stood up. He stood up in 
tough times. He stood up in good 
times. But the people of this Nation 
are better because this man has served 
in Congress. 
He is a close friend. You can hear 
that with the people that are talking 
here. 
He is a father who loves his children. 
He is a husband that loves his wife. He 
is a man that loves his God. Who could 
ask for anything more? 
JOHN, thank you. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI), my colleague. 
Madam Speaker, if it takes us up, 
you know, I am going to start actually 
asking for time. 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Congressman DAVIS 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
thank JOHN SHIMKUS and wish him the 
very best in his retirement. 
Now, JOHN, you may not remember 
this, but 4 years ago when I joined this 
Congress, I said I would like to come 
and meet you, so you invited me to 
your office. You could not pronounce 
my name. Few people can. I said, Just 
call me RAJA. My last name allows me 
to get on a first-name basis with every-
body in this place. 
From that point forward, we devel-
oped a relationship, a friendship, to the 
point where very recently, I came to 
him and asked him to cosponsor a piece 
of legislation, and he just said, ‘‘Put 
me on it,’’ without even asking me 
what I was asking him to cosponsor. 
It was moving to me, because he 
trusted me, and it was based on a 
friendship rooted on shared values. 
Even though we may not be in the 
same party, we are all Americans, and 
that is something that I deeply cherish 
about our relationship. 
Now, as a wise man once said, we can 
find common ground only by moving to 
a higher ground, only by moving to a 
higher ground. 
Working with JOHN
proved to me 
that we can ascend to higher heights, 
but only if we try. 
JOHN SHIMKUS represents the epitome 
of a legislator who tries to ascend to 
higher ground every day. 
Madam Speaker, I thank JOHN and 
his excellent staff, including his long- 
time chief, Craig Roberts, for their in-
credible devoted service to their fam-
ily, to their community, and to their 
country. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI for his comments to-
night. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN), a 
good friend of Congressman SHIMKUS 
and all of us. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman DAVIS for yielding. 
To Karen Shimkus and the family, 
thank you for sharing JOHN with all of 
us for so many years. Thank you for 
your warmth and friendship as well. 
I am told that JOHN is a big fan of the 
movie ‘‘Tombstone.’’ As the former 
chairman of the committee, now rank-
ing member of the committee, there 
are a couple of great quotes out of 
‘‘Tombstone’’ that I think sum up for 
many of us who have the pleasure to 
serve with him and see his passion for 
his district, see his passion for his com-
munity, see his passion for good policy. 
One of them would be when Kurt Rus-
sell said: ‘‘Tell him the law is coming. 
You tell ’em I’m coming and hell’s 
coming with me.’’ 
When you want somebody at your 
side fighting for a cause, that sums up 
JOHN SHIMKUS. 
Russell also said: ‘‘You called down 
thunder. Well, now you’ve got it.’’ 
As we have tackled these issues and 
we have watched JOHN stand up for the 
people that sent him here, we know 
that he is by their side. And he not 
only brings the passion, but he brings 
the intellect and he brings deep prin-
ciple to every fight. 
So, JOHN, we wish you and Karen and 
the family well. 
God speed in your next endeavor, my 
friend. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. WALDEN 
for his comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKIN-
LEY), sticking with the Energy and 
Commerce Committee that Mr. SHIM-
KUS has served on since he got to Con-
gress in 1996. 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. DAVIS for yielding. 
I rise tonight to honor my friend, 
JOHN SHIMKUS. Ten years ago, JOHN 
took me under his wing and was my 
mentor to get started in this, and I 
can’t tell you how much I have learned 
from being around JOHN. 
Now, in Scotland, ‘‘McKinley’’ means 
‘‘stubborn’’ in Gaelic. 
I have wondered, what does ‘‘Shim-
kus’’ mean in Lithuanian? Now, I have 
got to think, the only thing I can think 
of, trying to shake this out, is it must 
mean ‘‘persistence,’’ because I have 
never met a person as persistent as 
JOHN SHIMKUS. He personifies the trait. 
Think about what he has done in his 
24 years here in Congress. Just most re-
cently, his relentless focus in leading 
on the Brownfields legislation, or the 
fly ash legislation, or his love of TSCA. 
So, JOHN, you have made a difference. 
You have impacted many of us in our 
careers. You will never know how 
many lives you have touched and the 
hundreds of thousands of jobs that 
through your legislation you have 
helped create in America. I think we 
all owe you a debt of gratitude for 
that. 
So thank you for being a friend, 
thank you for being a great American. 
Thank you, Karen, for sharing him 
with us. 
It has been an honor to work with 
you, and I wish you the best in the 
years to come. 
God bless you. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. MCKINLEY 
for his comments tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), an-
other leader on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I thank JOHN for his service to the 
Congress, his service to the country. 
And JOHN’s life has been all about serv-
ice from West Point, to the U.S. Army, 
U.S. Army Reserves. 
For 15 years, it has been my high 
privilege to serve with JOHN on the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. You 
can tell by the number of members of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
who are here tonight just the impact 
he has had on that committee. 
I will tell you, JOHN, one of my 
fondest memories is in March 2011 after 
Harry Reid had shut down the project 
that was to be long-term nuclear stor-
age out at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. I 
still have a piece of rock that the 
Yucca mucker kicked up and the 
tailings when we walked into that 
enormous man-made cavern out there. 
But your passion for that issue has 
not dimmed over the years, and I will 
just promise you that we will take it 
up and carry on in the Congresses to 
come. 
I thank you very much for the privi-
lege of having known you. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. BURGESS 
for his comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS), 
another Energy and Commerce mem-
ber. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
I rise today to honor my good friend 
and 
fellow 
midwesterner, 
our 
col-
league, Congressman JOHN SHIMKUS. 
I had the absolute honor of serving 
with him also on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. 
His 24 years of serving this body has 
had a tremendous impact on our coun-
try, as we have heard, but personally, 
his role on the steering committee had 
a critical impact on my own career, 
from which I am retiring from Con-
gress this year as well. 
I thank him for fighting for me, be-
cause for the first time ever, two Hoo-
siers made it to the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, which was unprece-
dented, in myself and Dr. BUCSHON.

September 29, 2020 
So the reputation of the E&C, he has 
led the way in working both sides of 
the aisle, as we have seen, to create bi-
partisan legislation that he crafted to 
help all Americans. He was instru-
mental in designating 911 as the uni-
versal emergency number. I am a 
former teacher and the mom of a 
teacher; he ensured that schools have 
the appropriate lifesaving equipment 
to keep students safe. 
As a proud Lithuanian descendant— 
and I might say, he is a rock star in 
Lithuania, and I was there once with 
he and Karen in Lithuania—his support 
for our staunch ally has been critical 
to our two countries’ really important 
relationship. 
There are just so many things to 
mention. 
This body is going to miss him and 
his patriotic passion dearly, but I wish 
JOHN and Karen really an incredible re-
tirement of love and a lot of music. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mrs. BROOKS 
for her comments tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA), another 
E&C member. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman so much. I appreciate 
my friend for yielding. 
JOHN, we are going to miss you. 
You probably don’t remember this, 
because you talk to a lot of folks, but 
even before I got here, one of the first 
persons I talked with was you in your 
office. I can still remember. One of the 
things I was talking about was, How do 
I get on E&C? I hadn’t even gotten 
elected yet. But you were very gracious 
to talk with me that afternoon, and I 
will never forget it. 
One of the things I know about you is 
this: you have got your priorities right 
in life, and it is the way you build 
things. It is your God, your family, and 
your country. You always, always show 
that to the rest of us. It was something 
you believed in. 
Again, we all have such great respect 
for you. 
Also, serving on committee with you 
and when you were chairing the Envi-
ronment and Climate Change Sub-
committee, one of the things you were 
passionate about is making sure things 
got done. 
And TSCA, when we were talking 
about getting things done, no one 
thought it was going to get done. You 
got it done. 
The other thing you were working on 
that we have still got to get done is 
when we talk about Yucca Mountain. I 
will never forget when you took a 
group of us out there to Yucca. Again, 
it is something that you believed in, 
but it is something that we have to do. 
So that is your legacy. 
For all your years of service now 
here in the House, but also to your 
country in the Army, I think it really 
comes back to something my dad 
taught me. Dad was in public service 
for 36 years. He said: ‘‘Always remem-
ber, there are two types of people that 
get into this: those who want to be a 
politician and those who want to be a 
public servant.’’ And this is how he de-
fined it: A politician sees how much 
they can take from the people they 
represent for their own benefit, while 
public servants see how much they can 
give back to the people they represent. 
So all I can say is we are going to 
miss you. You have been a great leader 
on committee, you have been a great 
leader in this House. 
I wish all the best to you and your 
family, because I know we talked 
through the years about how our fami-
lies are doing, but I can’t thank you 
enough for your service to this country 
and to this House. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. LATTA for 
his comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE), 
another E&C member. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman very much for 
yielding. 
I am here tonight to honor Mr. SHIM-
KUS. I call him Mr. SHIMKUS because 
that is how a junior West Point cadet 
refers to a senior West Point cadet. 
One of the most insulting things I get 
here in Washington, people ask me 
often: ‘‘Were you at West Point with 
JOHN SHIMKUS?’’ 
I always say: ‘‘Do I look like I could 
have been at West Point when JOHN 
SHIMKUS was there?’’ 
b 2130 
We are not that far apart, the Class 
of ’80 and the Class ’87. But he is pas-
sionate about his country. 
I serve on the NATO committee with 
him. I am going to tell one quick story. 
It is really more about passion for his 
family. 
One year, we were visiting our allies. 
We were visiting in Holland, and JOHN 
went on a mission to find some kind of 
horn. I forget the name of the horn, but 
it is a Dutch horn. He went to a village. 
He went to somebody’s home. This 
thing wasn’t easy to find, but he said: 
I have to find it because my wife wants 
it. My wife always wants a unique mu-
sical instrument from some country 
that I visit. 
It wasn’t like, ‘‘I have to get this for 
my wife.’’ He was passionate about get-
ting it. This thing was as big as half of 
this table, and he had to carry it back. 
When he started telling people why 
he was doing it, you could just see the 
passion in his face. He goes: My wife— 
who is here with us tonight—my wife, 
she teaches music, and when she teach-
es this kind of music, this history, she 
gets these instruments out that I col-
lect. She goes through them, and she 
teaches the history of the country 
where this music is from. 
So it is combined. You could see 
JOHN’s passion for history, his wife’s 
passion for music, and his passion for 
his family. 
Then, finally, he may not remember 
this, but I was standing with him one 
of the preopening nights of the Bible 
Museum, and I remember being with 
him when he saw Martin Luther’s Bible 
that is there. He just looked at it. I 
could see him just speechless because 
of, the great Lutheran that he is, his 
love of the Word of God and the love of 
his God. 
It shows a common theme tonight. 
JOHN is passionate about his country, 
through West Point and his service to 
the Army and the NATO committee, 
and passionate about his family. 
It is just unmistakable. It is just 
there. It is in his face. His face shows 
everything he is thinking. When he 
talks about his wife, you can certainly 
see it. 
When I was standing there with him, 
he was passionate about his God. Duty, 
honor, country is learned at West 
Point, but country, family, and God, 
that is so important. 
Thank you, JOHN, for your service. 
We are going to miss you. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH), 
another E&C member. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, we 
have heard a lot of great comments 
about JOHN. I was not officially a 
mentee, but when I first got to the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee, he im-
mediately started giving me pointers 
and guidance. We would talk about 
issues, and we would talk about how 
you do things and how sometimes it is 
frustrating around here, as we all 
know. 
I appreciate very much all the help 
that you gave me and the guidance 
that you gave me through the years. I 
am going to miss you deeply on the 
committee. I appreciate all of your 
service. 
I could talk about all the things that 
all the other people have, but I am 
going to point something out that I re-
alized as I was sitting here. 
Every Member of Congress, by na-
ture, is a political junkie, and, unfortu-
nately, the time to celebrate your serv-
ice overlaps with a Presidential debate. 
So it will get higher ratings in the re-
runs than it will get in the prime time, 
first edition. 
But when you stop to think about it, 
think about all the Members of Con-
gress who stayed here, who wanted to 
say something positive about you, 
about your service, your commitment 
to your family, to your God, and to 
your country, we are all here missing 
that big event because we love JOHN 
SHIMKUS. 
So, God bless you. Godspeed on the 
work that you have to do further. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 
brief remarks. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor my colleague, my friend, 
and fellow pitcher on the Congressional 
Baseball Team.

colleague JOHN SHIMKUS pitch for an

September 29, 2020 
inning, I followed him on to the 
mound. After watching him for an en-
tire inning, I still, Madam Speaker, 
cannot throw the ball straight. 
But in all seriousness, it is a privi-
lege to serve with a man with such 
great character and commitment to 
service. 
In fact, JOHN, you are the epitome of 
a servant leader. I imagine this is how 
you were when you were a soldier, 
when you were a teacher, a local lead-
er. That is certainly who you are in 
this Chamber, and it has made all the 
difference. 
I am reminded of the scripture in 
Philippians that says: Do nothing out 
of selfish ambition or vain conceit. 
Rather, in humility, value others above 
yourself. 
That is who you are, JOHN, and that 
is the value and the trait that has 
made this country what it is today. I 
pray that we will have more leaders 
follow you in your ilk. 
It is an honor to be your friend. I am 
grateful for your friendship, and I wish 
you blessings and Godspeed in all your 
future endeavors. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I can attest, some-
times the gentleman cannot throw the 
pitch straight. My shin feels that. But 
I thank the gentleman for his kind 
words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER), 
the newest member of the SHIMKUS 
slumlord era at his townhouse. 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to thank my good friend, 
roommate, and colleague, Congressman 
JOHN SHIMKUS, for his 24 years of dedi-
cated service in the United States 
House of Representatives. 
JOHN began his life of commitment to 
our country when he enrolled at the 
prestigious West Point Academy. Fol-
lowing graduation from West Point, 
JOHN served 5 years in the Army and 
then entered the Army Reserves. 
Much like his time in the military, 
JOHN’s service in Congress has been de-
fined by his steadfast approach to lead-
ership and integrity. 
When I was elected to Congress al-
most 2 years ago, I was grateful to 
have JOHN, not only as my guide but 
also as a roommate and friend. It has 
been a great privilege to live in the leg-
endary 
Shimkus 
townhouse, 
where 
there were only two requirements: that 
I had to pay the rent on time and that 
I had to make sure the freezer was 
stocked with Dairy Queen Dilly Bars. 
I will always be thankful for the 
many late-night conversations after a 
hard day’s work, where he and I had 
the chance to discuss not only policy 
and legislation but also about our lives 
and families. 
Serving in Congress often means 
spending a lot of time away from fam-
ily and loved ones, so I want to thank 
JOHN’s wife, Karen, and his three sons, 
David, Joshua, and Daniel, for allowing 
their father, JOHN, to serve for 24 long 
years. I know they will be happy to 
have him closer to home, and our loss 
is their gain. 
Madam Speaker, this entire body will 
miss JOHN, and I am sure his constitu-
ency is thankful for his years of serv-
ice. I know I am. 
That is the conclusion of my official 
remarks, but I want to talk off the cuff 
for a couple of minutes. 
I just want to thank you for your 
faithful leadership, your Bible verses 
that you give to me every day, and the 
roommates. That means a lot to me. 
I want to thank you for mentoring 
me these past couple of years. I 
couldn’t have had a better mentor. 
Congressman SHIMKUS, you are a 
leader that we all look up to. Thank 
you. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS), another member of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for bringing us all together to 
honor and celebrate a senior member of 
the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, my friend and colleague who 
has led in so many different ways. 
I am privileged to have had the op-
portunity to serve with the Congress-
man from Illinois now for 10 years on 
the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. When I think about JOHN, I 
think about someone who is a true leg-
islator. He is the one who digs in and 
does the tough job of legislating, know-
ing the issues, being prepared, and fig-
uring out how to actually solve big 
problems. 
So you think about the fact that he 
led in modernizing the Toxic Substance 
Control Act. He has led on lowering 
fuel costs for hardworking families all 
across this country. It was JOHN SHIM-
KUS who led in bringing the 911 emer-
gency system into the 21st century. 
Time and time again, it has been 
Congressman JOHN
SHIMKUS
who is 
leading to get big things done in order 
to improve people’s lives and secure 
our future as Americans. 
I want to say, more than anything, 
we are going to miss you. We are going 
to miss your leadership. We are going 
to miss your example as a true legis-
lator. 
For the people of Illinois, for my col-
leagues on the House Energy and Com-
merce Committee, and for the people’s 
House, know that you have made a dif-
ference. I want to say thanks for your 
leadership. 
I want to wish you all the best, and 
I just want to say thanks to everyone 
for pulling us together tonight. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, Mr. 
SHIMKUS is always one of the guys I en-
joyed the most around here. We didn’t 
get to hang out a lot or share any of 
the same committees, but he is always 
an upbeat and friendly fellow to get 
along with around here. 
I didn’t want tonight to go by with-
out at least saying something to you 
about how I appreciate you and enjoy 
you. You take on really difficult issues. 
The education you have helped pro-
vide me and other Members on the sit-
uation down at Yucca Mountain is ap-
preciated, the battle on that, because 
that is extremely important to get a 
handle on how we deal with that issue 
around the country, which hadn’t been 
handled very well. You are a true lead-
er on that, and I thank you for that. 
Many, many blessings in your next 
endeavor. As a friend, I am glad to be 
here tonight with you. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I can’t tell you how 
privileged I am to be here tonight, to 
be able to stand at this podium and 
recognize my fellow colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to recognize some-
body who I worked for, for 16 years. 
I was talking to my wife, Shannon, 
about what I wanted to say about JOHN 
tonight because I really couldn’t think 
of anything really nice to say, after 16 
years. She reminded me that I wouldn’t 
be here without his mentorship. I 
wouldn’t be able to have this privilege 
to serve in this institution with you, 
Madam Speaker, and with everybody 
who crowded the floor tonight to honor 
our friend, Mr. SHIMKUS. 
She reminded me, you probably—his 
wife, Karen, who I am not supposed to 
recognize in the gallery, so I am not. I 
don’t want to be chastised later. 
But his wife, Karen, probably doesn’t 
know this, but I am probably their 
fourth son. This is somebody who 
taught me to be a good worker, taught 
me that being on time matters, taught 
me that helping others is a privilege. 
I can’t say thank you enough to this 
man because I would not be serving in 
this great institution without you and 
your mentorship, your friendship, and 
your leadership. It wasn’t without 
some hiccups, let me tell you. I am 
sure he wanted to fire me a few times, 
and I think he told me that a few 
times. 
But I prevailed. You know why? Be-
cause we had a great team. And a great 
team is built with the leadership of 
somebody who gives people opportuni-
ties to not just survive in a workplace 
but to excel. 
I can remember that I hadn’t thought 
about running for Congress in a very 
long time when I got a call in 2012 one 
day when there was an opportunity to 
put my name into the mix to run for 
this office. In typical JOHN SHIMKUS 
fashion—and his wife Karen could prob-
ably attest to this—JOHN called me and 
said: Hey, have you ever thought about 
running for Congress? 
And I said: Well, I guess maybe be-
cause I really enjoy watching you. 
He said: Well, if there is ever a time 
to think about it, now is the time. 
Okay. In typical JOHN SHIMKUS fash-
ion, he is like: All right, I have to go. 
Call Craig—Craig Roberts, his chief of 
staff, the godfather of my three kids. 
What a team. What a team. The en-
tire 
Shimkus 
team, 
including

chief of staff since I got here who 
worked with me on the Shimkus cam-
paign, in the Shimkus office, and is 
now my staff director on the com-
mittee that I am blessed to run, the 
House 
Administration 
Committee. 
What a legacy this guy leaves in this 
institution. 
People will not understand the im-
portance of JOHN SHIMKUS serving as a 
Member of the House of Representa-
tives until they look back in history 
and realize some of the things that our 
colleagues actually talked about to-
night. 
If you were in an emergency any-
where in this great Nation, and you 
have a cell phone that is a lot more 
ubiquitous today than it ever was when 
this guy came to Congress in the dark 
ages of 1996, you can dial 911 and know 
that it is going to get routed to your 
local emergency services center.

But before JOHN SHIMKUS got to Con-
gress, that didn’t happen. The things 
that we take for granted today were 
started by people who served in this in-
stitution years before us. If we don’t 
understand their legacy and we don’t 
understand 
the 
history 
that 
they 
brought to all of us and to our Nation 
to make sure that lives are saved, then 
we will never know their true impact. 
I personally know JOHN
SHIMKUS’ 
true impact because he impacted my 
life greatly. He has known me since be-
fore I became a parent of now a 23 year 
old and two 20 year olds. These chil-
dren look to him as somebody who 
mentored their dad. 
JOHN SHIMKUS. I know I don’t have a 
lot of time left tonight, and I have got 
probably a couple of months left to 
harass him a little bit in other speech-
es. But coming here to the U.S. House 
of Representatives and being able to 
get to know my friend’s roommates, 
his friends and now colleagues, it 
would not have happened without the 
gentleman. He has made me not just a 
Member of this privileged institution, 
he has made me a better person, he has 
made me a better dad, he has made me 
a better husband, and he has made this 
institution in the United States of 
America a better place for every single 
citizen in this country. 
Godspeed to you, Mr. SHIMKUS, in 
your retirement. Godspeed to Karen. I 
love you both. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2020 
No. 169 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, sovereign source of wis-
dom, hear our prayers. Listen as we lift 
our hearts to You. In our times of dis-
tress, answer us quickly. 
Strengthen 
our 
lawmakers. 
Keep 
them restless until they find rest in 
You. Keep them dissatisfied until they 
find their satisfaction in You. 
Lord, give them the wisdom to make 
wise choices that will glorify Your 
Name. Help them to keep their hearts 
and minds responsive to You, enabling 
them to help make a better Nation and 
world. 
Remind them that You keep a pro-
tective eye on the godly so that they 
may be surrounded with the shield of 
Your divine favor. May our Senators, 
with faith, expect You to provide them 
with strength for each task. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak in morn-
ing business for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WAR 
PATRIOTS MEMORIAL 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
have been working for decades to es-
tablish a memorial on the National 
Mall to those Black Revolutionary War 
patriots who fought for the founding of 
our country. We are close to achieving 
that goal, which is needed now more 
than ever. 
The rationale for the memorial was 
summarized 
in 
congressional 
testi-
mony in 1985 by its founder, Maurice 
Barboza: 
The Patriots Memorial would serve an edu-
cational purpose in that it would remind 
Americans of the rich and meaningful con-
tributions of Blacks to the birth of America. 
It would illuminate the past so that the 
present generation would better understand 
the Nation’s history. In that sense, it would 
serve a retrospective purpose. 
The Patriots Memorial would serve a pro-
spective purpose by helping future genera-
tions of Americans understand what it is 
that binds us . . . as a [nation]. 
He then quoted then-Representative 
Nancy L. Johnson, the memorial’s 
chief proponent in the House of Rep-
resentatives. I quote her and will end 
with this quote: 
An American cannot be identified by sim-
ple physical, ethnic, racial, or religious char-
acteristics. Even our cultural heritage is 
best defined by its rich diversity. What ties 
us together as a nation is our commitment 
to individual freedom and maintaining the 
rights and privileges guaranteed by the Con-
stitution to assure the perpetuation of our 
freedom. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY 
BARRETT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
Saturday evening, President Trump an-
nounced his nominee for the Supreme 
Court, Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh 
Circuit. 
I had the opportunity to meet with 
Judge Barrett earlier today. I left our 
discussion even more convinced that 
President Trump has nominated ex-
actly the kind of outstanding person 
whom the American people deserve to 
have on their highest Court. 
Americans deserve brilliant judges 
with first-rate legal minds. Judge Bar-
rett is that and then some. She at-
tended Notre Dame Law School on full 
scholarship, graduated No. 1 in her 
class, and was executive editor of the 
Law Review. 
She secured top-flight clerkships on 
the DC Circuit and the Supreme Court. 
After a few years in private practice, 
she returned to academia and built a 
national reputation as an award-win-
ning professor and legal scholar. Judge 
Barrett is brilliant. 
Americans also deserve judges who 
are committed to fairness and impar-
tiality, to following the facts in every 
case. They deserve judges who under-
stand that their job is to interpret the 
text of our laws and Constitution as 
they are written, not as the judge 
might personally wish they had been 
written differently. 
Again, Judge Barrett passes with fly-
ing colors. Her 3 years of rulings on the 
Seventh Circuit are the record of a 
judge who sets out to do impartial jus-
tice under law—nothing more and 
nothing less. This nominee could not 
be more fully qualified to serve on the 
Supreme Court. 
Harvard Law Professor Noah Feld-
man is a fierce critic of President 
Trump. He was one of the House Demo-
crats’ star witnesses in their impeach-
ment. He has known Judge Barrett pro-
fessionally for more than 20 years. De-
spite some philosophical differences, he 
went out of his way this past weekend 
to write that she is ‘‘highly qualified to 
serve on the Supreme Court.’’ 
Here is what Professor Feldman 
wrote: 
I know her to be a brilliant and conscien-
tious lawyer who will analyze and decide

September 29, 2020 
cases in good faith, applying the jurispru-
dential principles to which she is committed. 
Those are the basic criteria for being a good 
justice. Barrett meets and exceeds them. 
And if you ‘‘believe in an ideal judi-
cial temperament,’’ Professor Feldman 
went on, ‘‘then rest assured that Bar-
rett has it.’’ 
It is the same story from everyone— 
everyone—who knows Judge Barrett 
well. 
The dean of Notre Dame Law School 
says she is ‘‘an absolutely brilliant 
legal scholar and jurist [and] one of the 
most popular teachers we have ever 
had here.’’ 
One of her faculty colleagues said: 
‘‘She is a principled, careful judge, ad-
mired 
legal 
scholar, 
and 
amazing 
teacher.’’ 
Six young women who all studied 
under 
now-Judge 
Barrett 
say 
she 
drilled into them ‘‘the necessity of set-
ting personal beliefs aside when evalu-
ating the answer to a legal question.’’ 
These objective qualifications and 
credentials are what matter most. 
Judge Barrett deserves to be judged by 
her record. 
But a few more things bear notice. As 
our Nation continues to honor the 
trailblazing life of the late Justice 
Ginsburg, it seems fitting that Presi-
dent Trump has nominated another 
brilliant woman who has climbed to 
the very top of the legal field. Young 
women who know Judge Barrett well 
describe her as not just an excellent 
teacher but a gracious mentor and an 
inspiring example of female leadership. 
As the only congressional leader not 
from New York or California, I applaud 
the President’s decision to look to the 
heartland. If confirmed, Judge Barrett 
would be the only current Supreme 
Court Justice with a law degree from 
anywhere besides Harvard or Yale— 
from anywhere besides Harvard or 
Yale. I would say this nominee would 
bring welcomed diversity on multiple 
fronts. 
As I predicted last week, the far left 
is rushing to make this nomination 
about anything but Judge Barrett’s 
qualifications. The instant she was an-
nounced, they started with the same 
unhinged attacks they have recycled 
for every Supreme Court nomination 
by every Republican President since 
the 1970s. 
Remember, the far left said Justice 
Stevens opposed ‘‘women’s rights,’’ 
that Justice Kennedy would be ‘‘a dis-
aster for women,’’ and that Justice 
Souter would put the ‘‘health and 
lives’’ of Americans at risk. 
Well, Saturday went like clockwork. 
The political left took one more look 
at Judge Barrett’s qualifications, gave 
up on debating the merits, and headed 
right at the same old scare tactics. Our 
colleague, the Democratic leader, in-
formed Americans that this 48-year-old 
working mother was going to ‘‘turn 
back the clock on women’s rights.’’ 
This 48-year-old working mother was 
going to ‘‘turn back the clock on wom-
en’s rights,’’ so said the Democratic 
leader. 
The junior Senator from California 
said the nominee would ‘‘harm millions 
of Americans.’’ 
The junior Senator from Connecticut 
said ‘‘Amy Coney Barrett would create 
a humanitarian catastrophe.’’ 
Well, here we go again. Here we go 
again. One of the preselected scare tac-
tics is that Judge Barrett is out to 
steal Americans’ healthcare coverage. 
That is the claim. This mother of 
seven, including multiple children who 
were born or adopted facing preexisting 
medical challenges, is just itching to 
block families like hers from accessing 
medical care. What a joke. What a 
joke. 
When Senate Democrats were trying 
to attack Chief Justice John Roberts, 
long before ObamaCare even existed, 
they claimed he had sought to ‘‘put 
millions of American consumers and 
families at risk of losing coverage.’’ 
They have been recycling these same 
attacks since before they even passed 
the law they now say they are worried 
about. 
On this occasion, their entire argu-
ment seems to come down to a tech-
nical analysis Judge Barrett put for-
ward in a 4-year-old academic paper 
about one part of ObamaCare, which 
Congress has already zeroed out in the 
meantime. Let me just say that again. 
The entire argument seems to come 
down to a technical analysis that 
Judge Barrett put forward in a 4-year- 
old academic paper about one part— 
just one part—of ObamaCare, which 
Congress has already zeroed out in the 
meantime. 
These 
hysterical 
claims 
collapse 
under the slightest examination, but, 
sadly, they are just beginning. Three 
years ago, Senate Democrats’ bizarre 
attacks on Judge Barrett’s religious 
faith became a national embarrass-
ment for their side of the aisle. 
The senior Senator from Illinois 
asked now-Judge Barrett: ‘‘Do you con-
sider yourself an orthodox Catholic?’’ 
This was actually during a U.S. Senate 
hearing. The senior Senator from Cali-
fornia told her that ‘‘the dogma lives 
loudly within you. And that’s of con-
cern.’’ 
This was not, regretfully, an isolated 
incident. Over the past few years, mul-
tiple Senate Democrats, on multiple 
different occasions, have openly sug-
gested that certain kinds of religious 
beliefs might disqualify citizens from 
public service. 
In 2017, the junior Senator from 
Vermont, Senator SANDERS, told an ex-
ecutive branch nominee that he had 
made 
an 
‘‘indefensible, 
hateful, 
Islamophobic’’ statement because he 
had articulated a personal belief that 
Christianity gets things right which 
Islam gets wrong. 
In 2018, the junior Senator from Cali-
fornia, who is now asking for Ameri-
cans’ votes to be Vice President, at-
tacked a different nominee for partici-
pating in the Knights of Columbus. The 
Knights of Columbus? This is a mas-
sive, noncontroversial Catholic men’s 
association that is known for things 
like shoveling snow off church side-
walks and hosting pancake breakfasts. 
‘‘Were you aware that the Knights of 
Columbus opposed a woman’s right to 
choose,’’ Senator HARRIS
asked, as 
though it were remotely controversial 
that a famous Catholic organization 
would subscribe to Catholic teaching 
on the right to life. 
The junior Senator from Hawaii sug-
gested this nominee would need to quit 
the organization, quit the Knights of 
Columbus to serve as a judge. You 
would think the national backlash to 
all of this would have taught the polit-
ical left a lesson. 
Here is what happened in just the 
past few days. The Associated Press, 
Reuters, POLITICO, Newsweek, and 
the Washington Post have already run 
up major stories on the Barrett fam-
ily’s 
private 
faith 
practices. 
Each 
strongly implied there might be some-
thing worrisome or disqualifying if a 
Federal judge were a faithful Christian 
with strong ties to spiritual groups. 
POLITICO’s contributing editor lit-
erally went and peered around the 
physical grounds of a religious facility 
in South Bend so he could report what 
the youth group had written on their 
whiteboard. Less than 72 hours in, this 
is where we are. The elite class is al-
ready treating Americans of faith like 
exotic animals on display in a menag-
erie. 
Look, I understand the far left had 
committed to opposing this nominee 
before she was even named. I under-
stand some politicians have decided to 
oppose Judge Barrett before they even 
considered her record. But every time 
they choose to use the nominee’s per-
sonal faith as a political weapon, they 
will only be reminding millions of 
Americans why it is so essential to 
have judges just like Judge Barrett on 
the bench. 
In this country—our country—citi-
zens have religious liberty. In this 
country—our country—there is no reli-
gious test for public office. In this 
Country—our country—we have the 
right to seek the protection of the 
courts when our free exercise of reli-
gion is threatened. That is why we 
need judges like Judge Barrett who un-
derstand our laws and Constitution and 
will uphold our freedoms accordingly. 
If the reflexive opponents of Judge 
Barrett’s nomination want to argue 
otherwise, they will only be proving 
how much better she understands our 
Constitution than they do. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5887 
September 29, 2020 
about our investigation into potential 
conflicts of interest with respect to 
Ukraine policy during the Obama ad-
ministration. 
My 
Democratic 
col-
leagues have attacked this investiga-
tion with unsupported and inaccurate 
allegations that this investigation is 
rooted in a foreign-sourced influence 
campaign. They have asserted that our 
oversight activities relating to the 
Obama administration are advancing a 
Russian disinformation campaign and 
have implied that we are ‘‘wielding 
that disinformation as a political cudg-
el.’’ Nothing could be further from the 
truth, so I want to explain. 
My Democratic colleagues have pub-
licly insinuated that I received the 
records from a Ukrainian national, 
Andriy Derkach, a Russian agent who 
has taken action to influence and 
interfere in the 2020 election. 
Now, get this: I have praised the 
Treasury Department for sanctioning 
Derkach. I have neither received nor 
solicited information from Derkach. 
This is probably the third time I have 
come to the floor of the Senate to say 
this. Yet you still keep getting these 
accusations from my friends on the 
other side of the aisle. Now, the Demo-
crats know that we have not received 
this information. Yet they refuse to 
stop repeating their false insinuations, 
and those false insinuations have re-
sulted in Russian-based media repeat-
ing the Democratic disinformation, 
which is Exhibit A why the Democrats 
should have never created that false 
narrative in the first place. In fact, 
during the course of this investigation, 
the minority—not the majority—of the 
committee 
introduced 
Derkach’s 
disinformation 
into 
the 
committee 
record. 
Foreign election interference should 
have no quarter in this country, and we 
must do everything to stop that inter-
ference. If only the Democrats felt the 
same about the Steele dossier, which is 
the 
very 
definition 
of 
Russian 
disinformation 
and 
election 
inter-
ference. 
Our 
investigation 
is 
based 
upon 
Obama 
administration 
government 
records and records from a Democratic 
lobby shop, Blue Star Strategies. They 
aren’t based on any information that 
we received from a fellow by the name 
of Derkach. So if my Democratic col-
leagues 
think 
that 
those 
records 
amount 
to 
Russian 
disinformation, 
then that says more about the previous 
Obama administration than it does 
about the Johnson-Grassley inquiry. 
Do you think my Democratic col-
leagues would have attacked an inves-
tigation involving Donald Trump, Jr.? 
Remember, I interviewed the Presi-
dent’s son years ago as part of my Rus-
sia investigation. I didn’t hear any 
complaints 
about 
my 
investigative 
work at that time. Funny how this has 
played out, right? 
My 
Democratic 
colleagues 
have 
jammed up document production from 
government agencies and engaged in 
questionable political media efforts. 
We would have been done with this in-
vestigation a long time ago if all that 
opposition hadn’t occurred, but here we 
are, and now the American people can 
see our work and judge our work for 
themselves. 
I would like to remind my Demo-
cratic colleagues that the first step in 
this investigation was a letter that I 
wrote on August 14, 2019. That letter 
was about an Obama-era Committee on 
Foreign Investment in the United 
States transaction. That transaction 
gave control over an American com-
pany that made anti-vibration tech-
nologies with military applications to 
a Chinese Government-owned aviation 
company and a Chinese-based invest-
ment firm with established ties to the 
Communist Chinese Government. Re-
ports indicated that a firm formed by 
Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz, the 
stepson of John Kerry, later partnered 
with a Chinese-based firm to purchase 
the American company. 
Also at that time, Joe Biden was 
Vice President and John Kerry was 
Secretary of State. The State Depart-
ment is an approval agency on the 
Committee on Foreign Investment. 
Clearly, this transaction presented 
conflicts of interest, and that is ex-
actly why I wrote the letter of August 
2019 to the Treasury Department. 
My Democratic colleagues like to say 
that we started this investigation as a 
result of the Trump impeachment. 
Well, the last time I checked, August 
14, 2019, was well before the impeach-
ment investigation began. That letter 
was also sent before Congress was noti-
fied of the Ukrainian-related whistle-
blower complaint and before it was 
made public. 
No matter how hard the Democrats 
try to say otherwise, this investigation 
is rooted in nothing but simply good 
government oversight. That is exactly 
the type of investigation I have run my 
entire Senate career. 
After the August 2019 letter, news re-
porting picked up the pace about Hun-
ter Biden’s association with Burisma, 
the corrupt Ukrainian company, and 
the fact that his father was in charge 
of the Obama administration’s anti- 
corruption policy for Ukraine. 
Now, just think about that for a sec-
ond. Vice President Biden was respon-
sible for carrying an anti-corruption 
message to Ukraine on behalf of the 
U.S. Government. At the same time, 
his son was making millions of dollars 
working on the board of a corrupt 
Ukrainian company. 
To any reasonable observer, that is a 
very questionable fact pattern that de-
serves attention, and it got a lot of at-
tention besides from GRASSLEY
and 
JOHNSON. Documents made public as a 
result of the Freedom of Information 
Act 
and 
investigative 
reporting 
brought very fresh public attention and 
scrutiny to this fact pattern. 
Reporting showed additional poten-
tial conflicts of interest with respect to 
Hunter Biden’s business dealings all 
over the world, not just Ukraine. Those 
financial dealings also exposed how 
Hunter Biden and his business associ-
ates sought to benefit financially from 
their relationship with Vice President 
Biden. 
As our report shows, Hunter Biden 
and his business associates had exten-
sive connections to Russian or Ukrain-
ian nationals. Their business associa-
tion also extended to Russian nation-
als. 
The report also shows that Hunter 
Biden, his family members, and busi-
ness associates had extensive connec-
tions to Chinese nationals. The records 
acquired by the committee show that 
Hunter Biden and his associates and 
family members were connected to Chi-
nese nationals associated with the 
Communist Party and the People’s Lib-
eration 
Army. 
Those 
connections 
formed business links, which resulted 
in millions of dollars passing through 
company after company. 
Some of those companies were asso-
ciated with Hunter Biden, his business 
partner 
Devon 
Archer, 
and 
James 
Biden. The records show deep and com-
plex financial relationships with Chi-
nese nationals and how financially 
fruitful those relationships became. 
As one example, records show that 
Hunter Biden opened a bank account 
with a Chinese national linked to the 
Communist regime and funded with ap-
proximately $100,000. Then he, James 
Biden, and Sarah Biden went on an ex-
travagant 
global 
spending 
spree. 
Records show that Hunter Biden, via 
his law firm, also sent over a million 
dollars to James Biden’s consulting 
firm, the Lion Hall Group. When the 
bank contacted Sarah Biden, who was 
associated with the firm’s bank ac-
count, she refused to answer the ques-
tions and provide any additional infor-
mation and documentation. According 
to records we have on file, the bank 
submitted the account for closure. 
Now, what is very clear is that Hun-
ter Biden leveraged his name and his 
father’s position for financial gain, and 
his work with Burisma is just the tip of 
the iceberg. 
These associations and the millions 
of dollars that passed between and 
among Hunter Biden, Archer, James 
Biden, and others create criminal fi-
nancial concerns. Moreover, they cre-
ate counterintelligence and extortion 
concerns. 
The 
investigation 
also 
uncovered 
that the Obama administration was 
well aware of the problems that Hunter 
Biden’s board position caused. State 
Department officials testified that his 
board membership created the percep-
tion of a conflict of interest and was 
very awkward for all U.S. officials 
pushing an anti-corruption agenda in 
Ukraine. 
Secretary of State Kerry publicly de-
nied knowing of Hunter Biden’s role on 
the Burisma board. Now, we have ac-
quired evidence that he did, in fact, 
know about that role. 
The owner of Burisma was viewed as 
an ‘‘odious oligarch’’ by State Depart-
ment officials. However, in December

September 29, 2020 
of 2015, instead of following U.S. objec-
tives of confronting oligarchs, Vice 
President Biden’s staff advised him to 
avoid commenting on the odious oli-
garch and instead say ‘‘I am not going 
to get into naming names or accusing 
individuals.’’ 
Well, 
if 
you 
are 
running 
an 
anticorruption agenda in Ukraine and 
you pull your punches when it comes 
to Burisma while your son is on the 
board, that goes to judgment—and here 
it looks like very bad judgment and 
weak leadership. 
Based 
on 
witness 
testimony, 
Burisma’s owner allegedly paid a $7 
million bribe to officials serving under 
Ukraine’s prosecutor general to shut 
the case against him. When he alleg-
edly placed the bribe in December 2014, 
Hunter Biden was on the board and— 
can you believe this—he had been hired 
to be on the board to assist with what 
they call ‘‘corporate governance and 
responsibility.’’ Obviously, he wasn’t 
doing his corporate job—due diligence. 
The facts show that the Obama ad-
ministration was well aware of the 
problems that Hunter Biden being on 
the Burisma board caused. The facts 
show that the Obama administration 
turned a blind eye to it. Everyone 
knew about the problems it caused, but 
nobody wanted to do anything about it. 
So much for leadership. 
At its core, the investigation is a 
good government oversight investiga-
tion. These are exactly the kinds of 
shady, backroom deals that the Amer-
ican people should know about. So now 
the facts are out there. The American 
people can judge this information for 
themselves. They don’t need the people 
on the other side of the aisle of this in-
stitution telling them what went on 
when they were using disinformation 
from 
Russia 
and 
spreading 
that 
disinformation around and trying to 
say it was attributed to something that 
we got. 
As for the next step, Senator JOHN-
SON and I will continue to review the 
records that we possess and further 
records that we hope we are able to ac-
quire. 
I yield the floor.

f 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY 
BARRETT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, after 
Senate Republicans established the 
principle that the Senate shouldn’t 
consider Supreme Court nominations 
in Presidential election years, on Sat-
urday, President Trump nominated 
Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme 
Court with less than 40 days left in the 
Presidential election. 
The Senate has never—never—con-
firmed a nominee to the Supreme 
Court this close to a Presidential elec-
tion. In fact, the election is already un-
derway, but President Trump gets to 
play by different rules under this Re-
publican majority. 
By nominating Judge Amy Coney 
Barrett to the Supreme Court, Presi-
dent Trump has once again put Ameri-
cans’ healthcare in the crosshairs. 
President 
Trump 
has 
promised 
to 
nominate Supreme Court Justices who 
will 
‘‘terminate’’—his 
words—our 
healthcare law. In Judge Barret, Presi-
dent Trump has found the deciding 
vote. 
Judge Barret strongly criticized the 
ruling to uphold the Affordable Care 
Act, claiming that if Justices read the 
law the way she does, they would ‘‘have 
had 
to 
invalidate’’ 
the 
entire 
healthcare law. Let me repeat that: 
Judge Barrett strongly criticized Jus-
tice Roberts’ decision to uphold the Af-
fordable Care Act, saying that ‘‘he 
pushed [the law] beyond its plausible 
meaning to save the statute.’’ If Jus-
tice Roberts had read the law the way 
Judge Barrett does, the Supreme Court 
would have had to invalidate the entire 
Affordable Care Act. 
The Republican lawsuit against the 
Affordable 
Care 
Act, 
as 
everyone 
knows, will be heard 1 week after the 
election. Senate Republicans are rush-
ing to jam Judge Barrett’s confirma-
tion through in time for her to hear ar-
guments in that very case. Not one for 
subtlety, President Trump tweeted on 
Saturday 
that 
our 
healthcare 
law 
would be replaced ‘‘if terminated by 
the Supreme Court.’’ 
So the American people should make 
no mistake, a vote by any Senator for 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a vote to 
strike down the Affordable Care Act 
and eliminate protections for millions 
of Americans with preexisting condi-
tions. 
Judge Barrett’s record also suggests 
that if she is confirmed, the reproduc-
tive freedom of millions of women 
would be in grave danger. Should Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett be confirmed, a 
far-right majority on the Court could 
turn back the clock on women’s rights 
and a woman’s right to choose, work-
ers’ rights, voting rights, civil rights, 
environmental 
protections, 
LGBTQ 
rights, and many more. The future for 
DACA recipients hangs in the balance 
as well. 
So this nomination concerns no less 
than the fundamental rights of the 
American people. After holding a Su-
preme Court vacancy open for 8 months 
before a Presidential election, Presi-
dent Trump and Leader MCCONNELL are 
doing what no Senate has done before— 
shamelessly rushing to fill Justice 
Ginsburg’s seat less than 40 days before 
the Presidential election. 
Justice Ginsburg’s dying wish was 
that she not be replaced until a new 
President is installed. Republicans are 
poised not only to ignore her wishes, 
but to replace her with someone who 
could tear down everything she had 
built. 
This reprehensible power grab is a 
cynical attack on the legitimacy of the 
Court, and I would strongly, strongly 
oppose this nomination. 
The Senate Republican majority has 
decided, however, that they will stop at 
nothing, break all the rules—even their 
own rules—to rush this nomination 
through before the election. But appar-
ently the Senate majority isn’t going 
to stop at naked hypocrisy. It is also 
going 
to 
engage 
in 
manufactured 
hysterics. 
For the past few weeks, long before 
President 
Trump 
even 
nominated 
Judge 
Barrett, 
Senate 
Republicans 
have been telling everyone who will lis-
ten that Democrats ‘‘better not make 
Catholicism an issue in this nomina-
tion.’’ That is their quote. 
Last week, a Member of this Cham-
ber wrote me an entire letter preemp-
tively warning about anti-Catholic at-
tacks against a nominee who hadn’t 
been named yet. Another Member of 
this Chamber said that ‘‘in CHUCK 
SCHUMER’s America—only atheists can 
be Supreme Court Justices.’’ 
Of course, not a single Democrat will 
make these attacks or make personal 
religious beliefs an issue, but that 
doesn’t 
matter 
to 
my 
Republican 
friends. Oh, no. They will try to slan-
der Democrats with this imaginary 
issue anyway because they are des-
perate for a distraction. Republicans 
invented this concern because they are 
so eager to make this nomination 
about anything other than their dis-
graceful double standard—anything be-
sides their attempts to take away 
healthcare and curtail the fundamental 
rights of the American people. 
Honestly, it is embarrassing how 
transparent 
Republicans 
are 
being 
about this manufactured line of attack. 
They couldn’t even wait for a Catholic 
nominee to be chosen. They already 
scripted the attacks. 
The Senator from Tennessee is mak-
ing wild allegations; the Senator from 
Missouri is writing ridiculous letters; 
and my friend from Florida is cutting 
videos decrying the kind of attacks on 
a person’s faith that haven’t occurred 
since the political right was implying 
that our last practicing 
Christian 
President, President Obama, was a se-
cret Muslim. 
I don’t remember my Republican col-
leagues making a fuss when peaceful 
protesters were tear-gassed so Presi-
dent Trump could hold the Bible upside 
down in front of a church for a photo 
op. 
I understand why certain Repub-
licans are resorting to this disgusting 
tactic: They have no other argument. 
They can’t argue that this nomination

could proceed because of some solemn 
constitutional duty because they ar-
gued the exact opposite position 4 
years ago. 
They certainly can’t argue the mer-
its of Judge Barrett’s position on the 
Affordable Care Act because they know 
it is dreadfully unpopular with the 
American people. No wonder—no won-
der Republicans are so desperate to 
talk about, literally, anything else. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on an-
other matter, COVID–19, yesterday, the 
House of Representatives unveiled leg-
islation to provide $2.2 trillion in emer-
gency funding to help the American 
people in the fight against COVID–19. 
The proposal includes a number of 
crucial provisions that families, busi-
nesses, local leaders, and hospitals des-
perately need, including $600 in weekly 
emergency unemployment insurance, 
funding for our schools, support for 
State and local governments, assist-
ance for renters and homeowners, addi-
tional resources for testing and contact 
tracing, and measures to strengthen 
the post office and complete the cen-
sus. 
It includes important aid for transit 
systems, by the way, vital to our Na-
tion’s economy. It includes crucial sup-
port for economic drivers like res-
taurants, music venues, independent 
theaters, and more that we have named 
in our Save Our Stages Act, and it in-
cludes critical workplace standards and 
protections for our workers. 
Is this new bill everything that 
Democrats want? No, but it is an hon-
est attempt to provide the relief our 
country needs and reach an agreement 
by moving closer to our Republican 
colleagues who want to provide much 
less relief, if they want to provide any 
at all. 
Once again, the bill demonstrates the 
willingness on the part of Democrats to 
compromise. COVID–19 remains the No. 
1 issue in America. Weekly unemploy-
ment claims are still through the roof. 
Schools are struggling to adapt. Over 
200,000 Americans have died. We are a 
long way from putting this crisis in the 
rearview mirror. 
But none of this seems to concern the 
Republican majority in the Senate. As 
countless businesses are going under, 
as thousands continue to get sick, as 
millions of Americans are waiting for 
the Senate to do its job, Leader 
MCCONNELL
and Senate Republicans 
are moving at a lightning pace to jam 
through a Supreme Court nominee—a 
nominee who could rip healthcare away 
from tens of millions of Americans in 
the middle of a pandemic. 
Leader MCCONNELL chose to put the 
Senate on pause for 4 months while 
COVID devastated our country. Now 
Leader MCCONNELL has the Senate on 
fast-forward to rush through a partisan 
nomination to the Supreme Court. It 
goes to show you the priorities on the 
other side of the aisle. 
TRUMP TAX RETURNS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, one 
final matter: Over the weekend, the 
New York Times reported that Presi-
dent Trump paid $750 in income taxes 
in 2016 and nothing in 10 of the prior 15 
years, largely because he reported los-
ing more money than he made. No New 
Yorker was at all surprised by this re-
port. All the hallmarks of President 
Trump’s career before and after poli-
tics are there: hyperbole, fraud, avoid-
ing responsibility, and pursuing selfish 
interests above all else. That is Presi-
dent Trump in a nutshell. 
The documents obtained by the New 
York Times showed a long history of 
President Trump’s egregious tax avoid-
ance and potentially criminal activity 
and include the astounding figure that 
the President owes more than $500 mil-
lion—$500 million—in personal obliga-
tions. Who does he owe that money to? 
And $500 million is not chump change. 
Who does the President owe $500 mil-
lion to? 
If President Trump wants another 4- 
year term as President, the people have 
to know who President Trump is so 
deeply indebted to. These documents 
reveal that President Trump was an 
abject failure in business and a serial 
tax cheat. 
We have already heard the President 
claim the reporting in the New York 
Times is fake. Well, President Trump, 
put your tax returns where your mouth 
is.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN DAVID ARNOLD 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thought I 
would deliver a little good news. It is a 
little hard to get good news these days, 
but I ran across some. 
I want to tell you about a man 
named Dr. John David Arnold, who, 
many years ago, started out teaching 
school. He taught school in Arizona. He 
had a little blue bus from which he had 
ripped out the seats and put in desks. 
He used that blue bus to follow the mi-
grant workers from Arizona clear to 
the northern border as they worked, 
teaching the migrant kids. 
He came up with an idea. As tech-
nology advanced, he said: You know, if 
I give the kids a computer, I can han-
dle a whole lot more kids. They could 
use the phone to send their assign-
ments in. He did that. So remote learn-
ing has been around for a long time— 
probably 40 years. 
One of the benefits he found was that 
the parents benefited from it too. The 
parents 
of 
these 
migrant 
workers 
learned along with their kids. That 
program grew. 
Then he came up with another prob-
lem that he saw a solution for, and 
that is that, in Phoenix, there were a 
lot of high school dropouts and some 
kids being expelled. There weren’t good 
results from that. So he thought 
maybe he could start a school for these 
kids, and he would only take a student 
who had dropped out or been expelled if 
they would sign a contract. They and 
their parents had to sign a contract be-
fore they could become students. That 
contract had to say, of course, that 
they would behave, they would do their 
work, and what their goal was for a job 
after they got out of high school. Then 
he trained them for that. 
That was also a successful edu-
cational endeavor that goes on today. 
There have been a lot of graduates 
from that, and, today, there are stu-
dents helping students. 
A lot of people who graduated from 
that want to work with their hands and 
do things. He has turned out a lot of 
mechanics, and he has helped some me-
chanics get their own garages. Those 
mechanics have contributed money so 
that other kids who graduate can go 
into competition with them, but so 
that they will have the same kind of a 
start that they had. 
Now the students in the school and 
the graduates are working on inven-
tions to fight against COVID. This isn’t 
their first crisis. They were there after 
Katrina, and they are still there doing

work. On COVID, they have been pro-
viding food, clothing, and medical sup-
plies. They are still doing the job train-
ing. They have been working on some 
mental health problems. They have 
helped with utilities. They have helped 
with rent, and they have helped with 
group homes. 
Where is this happening? It is not 
just in Arizona, not just in Phoenix 
where it all started. It is happening in 
much of Arizona and in a lot of New 
Mexico. They are working with the 
Apaches and the Navajos. They are 
working against COVID in Mexico and 
in Africa. Yes, his school has expanded 
to Africa. They are in Ghana. They are 
in Cameroon. They are in Nigeria and 
in Liberia. 
There are some good things hap-
pening in this world—people watching 
out for other people. It isn’t govern-
ment that has all the solutions. It is 
people caring about people. 
I congratulate Dr. John David Arnold 
and his efforts following the blue bus 
and through these other iterations of 
education. I hope he is helping others 
with more on remote learning because 
that is where America is at the mo-

Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
TRUMP TAX RETURNS 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the 
New York Times’ latest reporting tells 
us everything we need to know about 
why President Trump has worked so 
hard to conceal his tax returns from 
the American people. The President is 
a liar, a cheat, and a fraud. For years 
he marketed himself as a self-made, 
successful businessman, but it is all an 
illusion. Like the Wizard of Oz, behind 
the curtain is just a small, petty fraud. 
He made millions playing a billion-
aire businessman on TV, but in real 
life, Donald Trump was racking up 
huge losses in debts that he then used 
to get out of paying his fair share of 
Federal taxes. Call it tax avoidance. 
Call it tax evasion. Call it whatever 
you want. The bottom line is that 
Trump is no business genius. He is a 
con artist who thinks that the rules 
don’t apply to him. 
The President managed to avoid pay-
ing any Federal income tax for 11 of 18 
years, from 2000 to 2017, and then only 
paid $750 in 2016 and 2017. When I first 
read that in the New York Times, I 
thought there must have been a typo. 
Surely there were zeros missing. I was 
wrong. The page read right. Our self- 
proclaimed billionaire President paid 
just $750 in Federal income taxes—$750. 
That is a heck of a lot less than what 
essential workers supporting America 
throughout this pandemic pay in taxes, 
like the grocery clerk in Newark, NJ, 
who makes $11 an hour but owes about 
$1,060 in Federal taxes—$300 more than 
Donald Trump. How about the nurse in 
Hackensack, NJ, working nights to 
save patients with COVID–19, making 
$60,000 a year. She owes about $6,200 in 
Federal income taxes—more than eight 
times what the President paid. 
Most people would agree that is a 
problem with our economy. Americans 
are working harder than ever for less. 
They are drowning in skyrocketing 
healthcare, housing, childcare, and tui-
tion bills. At the end of the day, many 
middle-class New Jersey families still 
find themselves owing money to Uncle 
Sam. Meanwhile, for rich people like 
Donald Trump, the tax rate is the low-
est it has been in decades, and you can 
write off fancy haircuts and consulting 
fees paid to your own daughter and all 
the losses you racked up running your 
business into the ground. 
I have to say, this is no surprise to 
most New Jerseyans. We watched in 
horror as Donald Trump ran his Atlan-
tic City casinos into the ground, 
scamming 
hard-working 
contractors 
out of their pay and costing the local 
economy thousands of jobs. Donald 
Trump was like a reverse King Midas— 
everything he touched went bankrupt. 
Then after his string of bankruptcies 
and 
broken 
promises 
to 
workers, 
Trump turned around and got a $72.9 
million bailout from the IRS—you 
heard me right, a $72.9 million bailout 
from the IRS. Most people I know 
think it is a good year when they get 
$400 or $500 back from the Federal Gov-
ernment; this scam artist got off with 
$72.9 million. 
Yet Donald Trump isn’t swimming in 
cash; he is drowning in debt. The Presi-
dent is on the hook for approximately 
$421 million in loans, more than $300 
million of that coming due in the next 
4 years. To get out of the debt, the 
President is doing everything he can to 
profit off the Presidency. Over the last 
4 years, he has continued to make 
money off foreign investments, rake in 
cash from special interests and foreign 
officials at his Washington hotel, and 
charge the Federal Government mil-
lions for the use of his properties. He 
could go anywhere. He could go to 
Camp David. No. He goes to his prop-
erties, where millions—Secret Service 
and other entities protect the Presi-
dent and help the President whenever 
he leaves Washington. But he is always 
at his properties. 
In spite of all this revenue, Trump is 
still badly in debt. It is no surprise 
that intelligence experts are concerned 
about who is holding it. They worry 
about the President’s personal expo-
sure to foreign creditors and what that 
might mean for national security. Any-
one else in that much debt to foreign 
entities would have their security 
clearances immediately revoked. Is 
this why Trump refuses to punish 
Putin for putting bounties on the heads 
of U.S. soldiers? Is this why he ap-
plauds dictators like Erdogan and sells 
out American allies like the Kurds? Is 
this why he applauds dictators like 
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte 
for doing ‘‘an unbelievable job’’? 
The bottom line is this: Who does 
Donald Trump owe those hundreds of 
millions of dollars to, and how much do

they know about him and how deep are 
they into him? 
For years, the President has fought 
to keep Americans in the dark. Well, 
now we know why. He is a liar, a fraud, 
and a failed businessman so deep in the 
red, he is a potential national security 
liability. 
Let me close by quoting President 
Donald Trump in his own book, ‘‘The 
Art of the Deal.’’ He said: 
You can’t con people, at least not for long. 
You can create excitement, you can do won-
derful promotion and get all kinds of press, 
and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But 
if you don’t deliver the goods, people will 
eventually catch on. 
I only hope the American people are 
catching on.

NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
selection of the person to fill the Su-
preme Court vacancy is a historic mo-
ment in Washington. This is the sev-
enth time that we will be in a position 
to at least meet someone who is aspir-
ing to that position. I have had oppor-
tunities with each one of them to ask 
some questions before the formal hear-
ing. I hope I have the same opportunity 
with the current nominee, Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett. 
What is different about this par-
ticular moment is the fact that we 
know that there is an issue at stake 
here and one that is likely to be de-
cided almost immediately by the new 
Supreme Court Justice. It is the only 
explanation I can find—perhaps one 
other—the only two explanations I can 
find as to why there is this hurry to fill 
this vacancy. 
You see, it was 4 years ago, when 
there was a vacancy on the Supreme 
Court with Antonin Scalia’s death— 
and that occurred on the February be-
fore the election—that Senator MCCON-
NELL, then the Republican Senate lead-
er, argued there was no need to hurry. 
Why hurry about it? Leave the vacancy 
on the Supreme Court. Wait until after 
the next Presidential election. Let the 
American people decide who will be 
filling that vacancy. 
He made that argument, despite the 
clear history in this Chamber that did 
not support him, and he won the sup-
port of his position by every Repub-
lican Senator. They went so far as to 
say that if President Obama, in his last 
year in office, nominated someone to 
fill the Supreme Court vacancy, they 
wouldn’t give that person a hearing. 
Well, President Obama, in his last 
year of his Presidency, nominated 
Merrick Garland, a person who was 
widely respected as the chief judge in 
the DC Circuit Court—the second high-
est court in the land by some meas-
ure—and Merrick Garland came to Cap-
itol Hill in the hopes that he would get 
his day in court, so to speak, in the 
Senate. But Senator MCCONNELL said: 
No way. Words out, Republican Sen-
ators, don’t meet with him. A couple of 
them broke his rule and met with him 
anyway. But the word was out not to 
even give him the courtesy of a meet-
ing 4 years ago. So Merrick Garland 
never had his day before the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, and his nomination 
departed with the Presidency of Barack 
Obama. 
Senator MCCONNELL’s new theory 
prevailed on how the Senate should 
treat Supreme Court vacancies. Every 
one of his soldiers on the Republican 
Senate marched in lock step with his 
theory. Well, guess what happened 4 
years ago later. An incumbent Presi-
dent had a late vacancy on the Su-
preme Court with the untimely death 
of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, just a little 
over a week-and-a-half ago. And the ob-
vious question to Senator MCCONNELL 
is: Will you be consistent now and say 
that that vacancy should not be filled 
until a new President is elected, and 
that President should have the option 
to fill it? And Senator MCCONNELL said: 
Of course not. It is not to my political 
advantage—he didn’t add those words; I 
did—not to my political advantage. I 
am going to change this hard-and-fast 
rule of 4 years ago, and I am going to 
ask all of my Republican Senators to 
march before a camera and a micro-
phone and to look down at their shoes 
and say the position they took 4 years 
ago, they are abandoning today. And 
all but two of them did it. All but two 
of them walked away from their pledge 
that they were under the old McCon-
nell rule. 
That McConnell rule was stated in 
just a few words. Here is what Senator 
MCCONNELL said 4 years ago: 
The American people should have a voice 
in the selection of their next Supreme Court 
Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not 
be filled until we have a new President. 
The McConnell rule was thrown out 
just a few days ago. Why? Because it 
was to Senator MCCONNELL’s advantage 
to fill this vacancy and to the Presi-
dent’s and not to wait for the outcome 
of the November 3 election. So what is 
the issue? What would cause Senator 
MCCONNELL to change so quickly and

September 29, 2020 
to ask all of his loyal Republican Sen-
ators to go through the embarrassment 
of recanting the position they took 
publicly 4 years ago? What is the big 
deal, Senator MCCONNELL? Well, it 
turns out we know what the big deal is. 
It is the Affordable Care Act. To para-
phrase a Senator from Arkansas, Dale 
Bumpers, the Republicans and Presi-
dent Trump hate the Affordable Care 
Act like the devil hates holy water. 
They have tried every imaginable way 
to eliminate it, to change it, to water 
it down, and to discourage it. There 
were 50 different votes in the House of 
Representatives to eliminate the Af-
fordable Care Act, and were it not for 
the Democrats in the Senate, they 
might have had some luck in doing 
that, but it didn’t work. So they tried 
it on the Senate floor under reconcili-
ation. They thought: Here is our 
chance. We just need a majority. We 
should be able to pull this one off. 
And we had this historic moment 
just 3 years ago when, at 2:30 in the 
morning, John McCain came through 
those doors, and, with his ‘‘no’’ vote 
and the vote of two other Republican 
Senators, saved the Affordable Care 
Act. Imagine the frustration of MITCH 
MCCONNELL. Here was his moment to 
finally drive that dagger deep in the 
heart of the Affordable Care Act, and 
John McCain voted no. What was he 
going to do to get this job done? 
Well, it turns out he figured he would 
get it done across the street in the U.S. 
Supreme Court. So 18 Republican State 
attorneys general filed a lawsuit to 
eliminate the Affordable Care Act. And 
then the Trump administration said: 
We are on board too. Let’s get rid of it 
completely. 
Off they went through the long 
treacherous journey in the courts all 
the way up to the Supreme Court 
across the street. Guess when the argu-
ment is scheduled to be heard. It is to 
be heard 7 days after the election. So 
you wonder why there is such a hurry 
to put another Supreme Court Justice 
on the Court who also opposes the Af-
fordable Care Act? And make no mis-
take, President Trump made that one 
of the conditions of employment for 
anyone he would name to the Supreme 
Court. You have to be ready to march 
right in there and put an end to it. 
So if we can vote under Senator 
MCCONNELL’s timetable on or before 
the election, November 3, the new Su-
preme Court Justice sworn in, in her 
black robe, ascends to the bench in the 
Supreme Court on November 10, listens 
to the oral argument on the Affordable 
Care Act, and then a few weeks or 
months later puts an end to it. That is 
why we are in such a hurry, because if 
that Supreme Court vacancy is not 
filled by November 10, then whomever 
is chosen, as they do by tradition, 
could vote on the actual outcome of 
the case in the spring. That is what 
this is all about. 
As someone told me long ago in this 
business of politics, there is always a 
good reason, and then there is always 
the real reason. The real reason for the 
mad dash of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee to fill the Supreme Court va-
cancy, the real reason why Republican 
Senators are asked to march in lock-
step and say that what they pledged 4 
years ago meant nothing today—the 
real reason—is to put an end to the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
Let me tell the story, if I can, about 
the Affordable Care Act. I voted for it 
and am proud to have done it. Twenty 
million Americans have insurance be-
cause of it—600,000 in Illinois and, I 
might add, protections for people all 
across America. Let me discuss one of 
the protections of the Affordable Care 
Act that will go away and be elimi-
nated if President Trump, the Repub-
lican Attorney General, and the Repub-
lican Senators who are supporting 
MITCH
MCCONNELL
have their way. 
Here is one of the provisions in the law. 
Here is the story. 
A couple of years ago, Tom from Pal-
atine, IL, a suburb of Chicago, wrote to 
me about the Affordable Care Act. I 
will show a picture here. This is him. 
At the age of 30, Tom, married with 
dreams of fatherhood, was diagnosed 
with cancer, a tumor in his chest. He 
underwent 20 rounds of chemo and 
major surgery to remove the tumor. 
Thankfully, after that, he was cancer 
free. 
There is Tom in his better days, rac-
ing to Wrigley. And there he is fighting 
his way through cancer in a hospital 
bed. 
How much did it cost him for all of 
that care? Two million dollars. Two 
million dollars was the bill. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, in-
surance companies imposed arbitrary 
annual and lifetime limits on how 
much they would actually reimburse a 
patient for medical bills. If you pass 
the limit, you are on the hook person-
ally. That is why for years, medical 
debt was a leading cause of bankruptcy 
in America. 
A fellow like Tom, racing along here, 
looking as healthy and fit as possible, 
ends up with a cancer diagnosis and 
goes through months and months of 
therapy and a bill of 2 million bucks, 
and the insurance company says: It is 
all yours. There is a limit in your pol-
icy. 
That is the way it used to be before 
the Affordable Care Act. The Afford-
able Care Act put an end to those lim-
its. Without those protections, Tom 
wrote to me and said that he ‘‘would 
most likely have capped [his] coverage 
and be bankrupt.’’ It is pretty clear. 
Thousands of other Americans could 
also be right there with him without 
the Affordable Care Act. Although Tom 
wants to continue working and con-
tributing to society, he said he is 
scared to death. He is ‘‘terrified’’—in 
his words—that protections for pre-
existing conditions would be ended. 
You see, Tom having defeated surgery 
and declared this great victory—I am 
sure his friends and family couldn’t be 
happier—is now branded by the insur-
ance companies as a man with a pre-
existing condition. 
In the old days, before the Affordable 
Care Act: Good luck, Tom. Good luck, 
because if you had a preexisting condi-
tion—and 
almost 
anything 
would 
count: acne, asthma, being a woman 
who might get pregnant, and on and on 
and on—you were subjected to higher 
premiums, maybe even no insurance at 
all. Those were the days before the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
Now, President Trump, the Repub-
lican attorneys general, and the Repub-
licans in the Senate are dutybound to 
send a new Supreme Court Justice in 
to put an end to that protection, to put 
an end to the Affordable Care Act. 
They are so determined to get rid of 
ObamaCare at any cost that they could 
care less about Tom and people just 
like him with these lifetime limits. 
If the Affordable Care Act is struck 
down, insurers could once again deny 
coverage to millions of Americans with 
preexisting conditions. That isn’t all. 
The Affordable Care Act also made it 
clear that if you are a family with a 
son or daughter who goes to college, 
comes out of school looking for a job, 
maybe had taken that gap year, maybe 
had taken an internship, but likely not 
to have health insurance, the Afford-
able Care Act says don’t worry. Until 
that young man or young woman in 
your household reaches the age of 26, 
they can stay on your family’s health 
insurance plan—a provision of the Af-
fordable Care Act and a provision that 
a lot of families count on. 
Our family needed something just 
like that when our daughter graduated 
college and didn’t have health insur-
ance and assured me that she sure 
didn’t need it and she was so healthy. 
Well, that is scary talk for a parent to 
hear. But when it came to the Afford-
able Care Act, we would have been able 
to keep our young daughter under that 
policy—our family policy—for a period 
of time. The Republicans want that to 
go away—to go away with the Afford-
able Care Act. 
You say to yourself: Well, clearly, 
Durbin, you are not telling the whole 
story. You are not telling us what the 
Republican plan is to replace the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
It is true—guilty as charged. I am 
not describing to you the Republican 
alternative to the Affordable Care Act 
because it doesn’t exist. It does not 
exist. That is why John McCain and 
two other Republican Senators said: 
You can’t eliminate the Affordable 
Care Act unless you have a replace-
ment that is as good or better. Other-
wise, too many American families will 
lose their insurance and lose their pro-
tection. 
We had a hearing a few weeks ago, 
and I asked the leaders in the health 
community under the Trump adminis-
tration the basic question: What have 
you heard about the Republican sub-
stitute for the Affordable Care Act? 
President Trump has told us over and 
over and over and over again that it is

September 29, 2020 
just a week or two away. So what have 
you heard about preparedness? 
They said: Nothing. We have heard 
nothing. 
There is no Republican substitute for 
the Affordable Care Act. They are just 
dutybound to eliminate ObamaCare, 
and, sadly, the consequences would be 
awful. 
That is what this is about. So if you 
think, I don’t want to tune in to this 
whole debate about a new Supreme 
Court Justice from Indiana; I don’t 
want to hear all these arguments be-
cause what difference does it make to 
me—if you are that person in Amer-
ica—I would say to you, please, take a 
look at what we are really facing 
here—an effort to fill a vacancy on the 
Supreme Court in a timely way to 
eliminate the Affordable Care Act. 
That is what this is all about. 
Then, the President, just for good 
measure, tossed in another issue last 
week. How about this one—the first 
President in the history of the United 
States to not publicly declare that he 
would accept the outcome of an elec-
tion? How about that? It is nothing 
short of a constitutional outrage that 
any President would say that. It is no 
surprise with this President because, 
when he was a candidate, he said basi-
cally the same thing: If it doesn’t turn 
out that I win, then, I am not sure I 
want to live by the results. 
He makes up these contrived argu-
ments against paper ballots and how 
fraudulent they are. There are five 
States—five States in America—that 
use mail-in ballots exclusively. They 
include, of course, the State of Oregon, 
which might have been one of the first, 
and they include the State of Utah, as 
well, and Hawaii. Other States do it. 
How much fraud is there? Almost none. 
But that doesn’t stop the President 
from claiming that mail-in ballots are 
fraudulent. 
How does the President vote, inciden-
tally? By mail-in ballot. What hypoc-
risy for him to make that kind of 
statement when he is casting his own 
vote with a mail-in ballot. 
So now he said that he wants that 
Supreme Court vacancy filled: Do it 
now because I need nine Justices sit-
ting on that Supreme Court if there is 
any election contest to follow. 
It is pretty obvious what this is all 
about. The President needs a sure vote 
on the Supreme Court. 
What a shame that we have reached 
this point, that we have denigrated the 
U.S. Senate to the point that we 
change the rules at our convenience, 
that we have reached the point where 
we are prepared to eliminate protec-
tions for 20 million Americans with 
nothing to replace it, and that we have 
reached a point where a President is so 
brazen as to say he wants to fill that 
spot on the Supreme Court just in case 
he runs into an election contest. 
You would think there would be a 
chorus—a bipartisan chorus—of out-
rage for that statement by the Presi-
dent. Not so. There may have been oth-
ers—and I will scour the records to 
make 
sure—but 
two 
Republicans 
stepped up and said that the Presi-
dent’s public statement on not abiding 
by election returns was terrible. 
Who were those two? Senator MITT 
ROMNEY, here, the only Republican 
Senator I know of. If there were more, 
I will come back and correct the 
record. But I heard him clearly say 
that what the President said was intol-
erable. Then there was the Republican 
Governor of Massachusetts. I watched 
that press conference. He wasn’t just 
declarative. He was upset to think that 
any President of either party would 
make that kind of statement. That is 
what we are up against. 
Two weeks from yesterday, they 
want to hold a hearing in the Senate 
Judiciary Committee on this nominee, 
Judge Barrett, and they want the vote 
before the election, before the argu-
ment on the Affordable Care Act, and 
before the President faces any possi-
bility of an election contest. 
What a point we have reached in this 
country. The silence of Republicans 
across the Nation is deafening. They 
ignore the obvious. 
You cannot have a viable, trust-
worthy democracy if you don’t have 
viable, trustworthy elections, and in 
order to have that happen, you need 
Presidents of both political parties who 
are committed to fairness, committed 
to honesty, and committed to our Con-
stitution. 
Sadly, at this moment in time, we do 
not have a President who is, and there 
are too many of his own political party 
who stand back in the shadows in si-
lence, recanting on pledges they made 4 
years ago, doing whatever is necessary 
to win the favor of this President. 
I hope another day will come soon 
with different leadership and a dif-
ferent view of this country. I am genu-
inely concerned about what we face on 
November 3 and the days that follow, 
but I have never given up on America, 
and I never will. I believe this democ-
racy will prevail, and I hope that after 
he is gone, some Republicans will step 
forward and say: It is time to create a 
party not in his image. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

for the quorum call be rescinded.

eration of H.R. 8337; finally, that all

NATIONAL BLACK BUSINESS 
MONTH 
Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize the great work 
of the Georgia Greater Black Chamber 
of Commerce. The Georgia Greater 
Black Chamber has focused on recog-
nizing the integral contributions of 
Black-owned businesses to the strength 
of both our State and our Nation’s 
economy during National Black Busi-
ness Month in Auqust. For 7 straight 
years, Georgia has been named the No. 
1 place in the country in which to do 
business, and the Georgia Greater 
Black Chamber has been instrumental 
in making that possible. 
As I mentioned, August was National 
Black Business Month, and the Georgia 
Greater Black Chamber celebrated by 
honoring an important Georgian: Mr. 
Herman J. Russell.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5894 
September 29, 2020 
H. J. Russell was the epitome of the 
American entrepreneur. Despite all the 
obstacles in his way, he worked hard to 
achieve his dreams. His business start-
ed as a plastering company, and he 
grew it into one of Atlanta’s best real 
estate developers. Anywhere you look 
in Atlanta, you will see the incredible 
landmarks that the H.J. Russell Com-
pany has worked on: the Georgia 
Dome, Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, and 
Castleberry Hill. As a business guy my-
self, I am inspired by all that Herman 
J. Russell did in his life. Simply put, 
Atlanta would not be what it is today 
without H.J. Russell and the H.J. Rus-
sell Company. His children carry on 
this entrepreneurial spirit to this day. 
I recently had the opportunity to visit 
with his sons Michael and Jerome. 
They and their sister Donata Russell 
Ross are dedicated to continuing Black 
entrepreneurship. 
Recently, I had the privilege of vis-
iting the Russell Center for Innovation 
and 
Entrepreneurship—RCIE—with 
Housing and Urban Development Sec-
retary Ben Carson. The Russell Center 
assists 
African-American 
entre-
preneurs by providing workspace, net-
working opportunities, and educational 
resources. In 2019, RCIE converted a 
43,000-square-foot 
corporate 
head-
quarters into space for 100 emerging 
entrepreneurial companies. RCIE is a 
testament to the efforts of African- 
American entrepreneurs to uplift each 
other. 
As the Georgia Greater Black Cham-
ber and other organizations in my 
State look to support growth in Black 
business and entrepreneurship, I will 
continue to work to support them. 
Through a recent conversation with 
Dr. David Thomas, president of More-
house College, I was made aware that 
approximately 45 percent of the young 
men who start as freshmen at More-
house will not graduate. I have ap-
pealed to the Georgia business commu-
nity to support HBCU’s and hire their 
graduates as part of the solution to 
this problem. I was also proud to work 
with Congressman David Scott on a 
scholarship program for the ‘‘1890s’’ 
land grant institutions like Fort Val-
ley State to help ensure they can con-
tinue to produce farmers and agri-busi-
nesses that are of critical importance 
to Georgia’s economic future. 
African-American 
entrepreneurship 
and business ownership accounts for 
nearly 3 million businesses in the 
United States and nearly a million em-
ployees. 
Before 
COVID–19, 
African- 
American unemployment was at its 
lowest point in U.S. history. These are 
remarkable statistics, but we must 
continue to advance the important 
work of supporting Black businesses, 
as this is key to empowering commu-
nities and individuals to move out of 
poverty and into prosperity. 
I look forward to working with the 
Georgia Great Black Chamber of Com-
merce and other Chambers in Georgia 
to ensure Georgia remains the best 
place in America for all businesses.

report accurately and sensitively about and 
reduce 
the 
stigma 
surrounding 
mental 
health disorders, mental health care, mental 
health law and policy, and related issues; 
Whereas Mrs. Carter, in 2008, played a key 
role in supporting the passage of the Paul 
Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health 
Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which 
helps ensure that mental health disorders 
and substance use disorders are covered by 
insurance at parity with other illnesses; 
Whereas Mrs. Carter, who has long been a 
champion of the physical and mental health, 
strength, and resilience of family caregivers, 
established the Rosalynn Carter Institute for 
Caregiving in 1987, where she continues to 
serve as President of the Board of Directors; 
Whereas, throughout Mrs. Carter’s 50 years 
of advocacy for mental health, she has been 
an effective champion for the elimination of 
stigma and discrimination against people 
with mental health disorders, which are 
among the most common health conditions 
around the world; and 
Whereas, at 93 years of age, Mrs. Carter 
continues her devoted work to improving the 
lives of those affected by mental health dis-
orders and substance use disorders in the 
United States and around the world: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) hereby expresses its profound gratitude, 
on behalf of the people of the United States, 
to Rosalynn Smith Carter for her lifetime of 
accomplishments and commitment on behalf 
of those affected by mental health disorders 
and substance use disorders; 
(2) recognizes, praises, and appreciates the 
improvements in wellbeing and the better-
ment of society Mrs. Carter’s contributions 
have engendered; and 
(3) encourages all people of the United 
States to follow Mrs. Carter’s example of 
putting compassion into action through a 
lifetime of service to humanity.

VETERAN’S PROSTATE CANCER 
TREATMENT AND RESEARCH ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in 
favor of H.R. 6092, the Veteran’s Prostate 
Cancer Research and Treatment Act. This bill 
will support our Nation’s heroes who are diag-
nosed with prostate cancer. 
September is recognized as National Pros-
tate Health Month, or Prostate Cancer Aware-
ness Month. The timing could not be better to 
advance the Veteran’s Prostate Cancer Re-
search and Treatment Act from the House 
floor. 
Prostate cancer is the number one cancer 
diagnosed at the Veterans Health Administra-
tion (VHA) and this bill will improve the care 
our veterans receive every step of the way. 
Whether it be at an early screening, the dif-
ficult moment a veteran receives a prostate 
cancer diagnosis, during treatment, during re-
covery, or while receiving end of life care, our 
veterans deserve the best. 
The VA is already a notable leader in pros-
tate cancer research and the goal of this legis-
lation is to help the agency build on its suc-
cess. A clearly defined national clinical path-
way for the treatment of prostate cancer is 
needed because 500,000 veterans are being 
treated for it in the VHA today. 16,000 vet-
erans are diagnosed with prostate cancer an-
nually—nearly 43 each day. 
The most common cancer diagnosed in the 
VA health system should be met with the most 
recent clinical data, national expertise, and 
state-of-the-art technology. Another element of 
my bill is the creation of a national prostate 
cancer registry. Cancer registries are impor-
tant because they inform research and lead to 
improved treatment protocol, and thus, out-
comes. The creation of a registry supports the 
goals of the clinical pathway and allows for 
updates and improvements as researchers 
learn more about the disease. 
I thank my colleague Mr. CUNNINGHAM for 
working with me as the democratic lead on 
this bill. I encourage all of my colleagues to 
support the Veteran’s Prostate Cancer Re-
search and Treatment Act today so that the 
VA may better support our veterans’ health 
moving forward.

COMMENDING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
WORK 
OF 
REVEREND 
LEON 
FINNEY, JR. 
HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor and commemorate the life of Reverend 
Leon Finney, Jr., who stood at the forefront of 
advancing the cause of justice in Chicago and 
throughout the nation. 
A spiritual mentor of mine at McCormick 
Theological Seminary, where he founded the 
African American Leadership Program, which 
was responsible for the training of innumer-
able African American Pastors in receiving 
their master’s degrees. Rev. Finney’s work in 
Chicago’s spiritual, educational, and civil rights 
communities was deeply intertwined and cata-
lyzed positive change for the most vulnerable 
members of our society. 
Rev. Finney was an organizer’s organizer. 
Shortly after serving his country in the Marine 
Corps, he would join the Woodlawn Organiza-
tion, 
a 
community 
group 
in 
Chicago’s 
Woodlawn neighborhood where Rev. Finney 
worked tirelessly to revitalize Woodlawn after 
the neighborhood was nearly decimated in the 
1960s and 1970s. Rev. Finney’s activism 
would open the eyes of those across Chicago 
and the United States to what is really pos-
sible when communities come together. The 
arc of Rev. Finney’s legacy is long and 
stretches 
from 
Congressman 
Ralph 
H. 
Metcalfe, Jr. to Reverend Jessie L. Jackson, 
Sr., from Mayor Harold Washington all the 
way to former President Barack Obama. 
A deeply spiritual man with an unparalleled 
understanding of how faith could help uplift 
entire communities, Rev. Finney served as the 
pastor of three churches, and was the founder 
of the Christ Apostolic Church, which would 
later merge with the Metropolitan Apostolic 
Community Church where Rev. Finney contin-
ued to serve the people of Chicago’s South 
Side as a senior pastor. Rev. Finney’s sense 
of justice was also evident throughout his ca-
reer in public service, beginning with his three 
decades of service on Chicago’s city planning 
commission, followed by a chairmanship of 
Chicago State University’s board of trustees, 
and continuing as a board member of the Chi-
cago Housing Authority for five years there-
after. His strong commitments to equity and 
community empowerment enabled these orga-
nizations to better serve the people of Chicago 
for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I along with countless oth-
ers, are in deep mourning due to Rev. 
Finney’s transition, but we all remain com-
mitted to furthering his life’s pursuit. My con-
dolences are extended to his immediate fam-
ily, his church, and to his many friends. His 
legacy lives on.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GALE 
SAYERS 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Gale Sayers, 
who passed away this week. A native Kansan, 
Gale was a revered athlete in the Sunflower 
State. 
Known as the Kansas Comet, Gale played 
football at the University of Kansas for three 
years before getting selected by the Chicago 
Bears in the 1965 NFL draft. He went on to 
become the youngest professional football 
player ever inducted into the Hall of Fame. 
Though Gale’s career was cut short after a 
knee injury, he was still considered a re-
nowned player for many years and inspired 
young athletes across the county. Many will 
remember his accomplishments on the field, 
but he also contributed to the community in 
other ways. At KU, Gale joined the student 
march for fair housing. Most notably, Gale 
spoke up about the pattern of head trauma 
football players face over time and its long- 
term consequences, a topic that was still rel-
atively unknown and unstudied. 
Madam Speaker, I am deeply grateful for 
Gale’s contributions and I know that even in 
his death, he will continue to be remembered 
for generations. I offer my heartfelt condo-
lences to Gale’s family and friends.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JORGE 
NUN˜ EZ 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Jorge Nun˜ez, a tireless 
fighter for peace and social justice. 
In the 1980s, Jorge made the difficult deci-
sion to immigrate to the United States in order 
to flee the terrible violence that had fallen on 
his beloved countrymen and women in El Sal-
vador. Although he was new to this country, 
he continued to dedicate his life mission to 
fight for the oppressed and the dignity of all 
human beings. 
If you ask Angelenos about Jorge Nun˜ez, 
they will tell you he is known for his social 
service work. He started his advocacy efforts 
as a community organizer in Los Angeles with 
the Salvadoran American Leadership and 
Educational Fund (SALEF), where he pro-
moted the vote of Salvadorans and Latinos. 
He later became a respected staff member for 
State Assembly Speaker Fabian Nun˜ez, and 
subsequently completed his career as Assist-
ant to the President of the State Senate, Kevin 
De Leo´n, and as Board Member Emeritus of 
SALEF. 
Regardless of his titles, Jorge devoted him-
self to working tirelessly for the rights of immi-
grants and their families, including TPS hold-
ers, day laborers and braceros. He never said 
no, and his desire to help was always present, 
even in his last days. 
Jorge’s humility and commitment to his val-
ues were his finest characteristics. His kind-
ness and sense of humor were a couple of the 
reasons he was so well-liked and respected in 
all social circles. 
Jorge leaves behind a beautiful family, his 
wife Sonia, and four children, Damaris, Edwin, 
Jorge and Marvin.

HONORING THE CAREER OF LEROY 
JACKSON 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the career of LeRoy 
Jackson who is retiring from his position as 
City Manager of Torrance, California at the 
end of September 2020. LeRoy has served 
the city of Torrance for 54 years and is one of 
the longest serving city managers in the state 
of California and the country. I had the honor 
of working with LeRoy when I served on the 
Torrance City Council. Torrance is a better 
place to live, work and play because of 
LeRoy’s distinguished service. 
LeRoy is a native Californian who has lived 
in Torrance since 1967 and graduated from 
California State University, Long Beach with a 
degree in Political Science and Public Admin-
istration. He first started his career serving 
Torrance in 1966 as a Personnel Analyst. 
After serving in various positions on the City 
Manager’s staff, he was appointed as the 
city’s fourth City Manager in 1983 and has 
spent 37 years serving in that position. 
As City Manager he helps lead a city of 
over 146,000 people and oversees ten depart-
ments with over 2,000 employees and a budg-
et exceeding $320 million. In his five decades 
serving Torrance, Leroy has helped the city 
grow and thrive through multiple recessions 
and served alongside numerous mayors, 
council members and department heads. 
Torrance Mayor Patrick Furey stated that 
LeRoy’s ‘‘thoughtful leadership, fiscal foresight 
and dynamic approach to city planning have 
helped groom our City’s strong executive 
staff.’’ Former Mayor Frank Scotto said, ‘‘the 
key to his longevity is that he’s exceptionally 
good at seeing the best things in other people 
and getting good people around him.’’ LeRoy’s 
management style has helped the city suc-
ceed throughout the decades he has served 
Torrance. 
LeRoy is confident that the organization he 
has helped create will continue to serve Tor-
rance well. I would like to thank LeRoy for his 
incredible public service, and wish him, his 
wife Connie and their family all the best.

HONORING 
IVETTE 
DOMINGUEZ 
DRAWE, OWNER AND PRESIDENT 
OFALPINE BUICK GMC 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
today to recognize the accomplishments of 
Ms. Ivette Dominguez Drawe who will be hon-
ored by The Chamber of Northwest Douglas 
County as a ‘‘Woman Who Soars.’’ 
Ms. Dominguez Drawe is an outstanding 
businesswoman. She is one of just 13 His-
panic female car dealership owners among 
thousands of General Motors dealerships na-
tionwide. Her first location, opened in Denver 
in 2007, consistently outperforms any other 
Buick GMC dealership in Denver. 
In 2017 and 2018, Ivette acquired struggling 
dealerships in Illinois and quickly turned them 
into thriving, profitable businesses. She pur-
chased Alpine Buick GMC South in late 2018 
and Post Oak Toyota in late 2019. In Summer 
2020, she will officially open Alpine Buick 
GMC’s hallmark location in Douglas County, 
Colorado. 
Ivette currently serves on the Denver Metro 
Chamber of Commerce Board, on the Habitat 
for Humanity of Metro Denver Board, and is 
immediate past chair of GM’s Minority Devel-
opment Dealership Council. She also supports 
local women and families through her dealer-
ship’s Alpine Cares program, which grants up 
to $15,000 per year to organizations such as 
the Colorado Ovarian Cancer Alliance and is 
a sponsor of Habitat for Humanity annual 
builds. Ivette and Alpine Buick GMC are also 
longtime supporters of Children’s Hospital Col-
orado. 
A tireless volunteer, advocate, and commu-
nity supporter, I can think of few others more 
deserving of this honor and I congratulate Ms. 
Dominguez Drawe for being recognized as a 
‘‘Woman Who Soars.’’

RECOGNIZING HYDROCEPHALUS 
AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. LLOYD DOGGETT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Hydrocephalus Awareness 
Month. Every September patients, caregivers 
and their families come together throughout 
the nation in support of the more than 
1,000,000 people of all ages living with hydro-
cephalus in the United States. As co-chair of 
the Congressional Pediatric and Adult Hydro-
cephalus Caucus, I believe Congress has an 
important role to play in both raising aware-
ness of this condition, as well as crafting poli-
cies that result in better treatments and poten-
tially a cure. I urge my colleagues to join the 
caucus to learn more about this devastating 
condition. 
Anyone can develop hydrocephalus, an ab-
normal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in 
the brain, at any time. This can include pre-
mature babies, active duty service members, 
veterans, and seniors. Individuals can also be 
born with hydrocephalus, develop it as part of 
the aging process, or acquire it as a result of 
infections, brain tumors or traumatic brain inju-
ries, among other causes. The only present 
treatment for this condition is brain surgery. 
From children to veterans, the prevalence of 
this condition is reflected in my own district. 
The physicians and staff at the Children’s 
Hospital of San Antonio perform the brain sur-
geries necessary to treat many of the one in 
770 babies across the country who develop 
hydrocephalus per year. Nationwide, these 
cases alone cost the U.S. health care system 
$2 billion per year. Veterans and active mili-
tary personnel, such as those stationed at 
Joint 
Base 
San 
Antonio, 
are 
also 
disproportionally affected. Medical researchers 
believe that two-thirds of our nation’s current 
and former military service members suffering 
from moderate to severe traumatic brain inju-
ries are at risk of developing hydrocephalus. 
In the midst of this pandemic, it is now more 
important than ever to improve the federal 
government’s partnership with the hydro-
cephalus community. Many individuals with 
hydrocephalus live with other serious medical 
comorbidities, putting them at a higher risk for 
severe illness from COVID–19. We must do all 
we can to help patients, health care profes-
sionals and families as they struggle to main-
tain and improve quality of life during these 
challenging times. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing Hydrocephalus Awareness Month and 
the 1 million Americans living with hydro-
cephalus by joining the Congressional Pedi-
atric and Hydrocephalus Caucus.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE DEFEAT OF ABOL-
ISHING 
THE 
ELECTORAL 
COL-
LEGE 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, in Sep-
tember 1969, Senator Birch Bayh, Chairman 
of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Con-
stitutional Amendments, introduced a constitu-
tional amendment to abolish the Electoral Col-
lege. The amendment passed with over-
whelming bipartisan support in the House and 
with support from President Richard Nixon. 
But on this day 50 years ago, the amendment 
was blocked by a filibuster in the Senate. 
The author of two successful and important 
constitutional amendments (the 25th and 
26th), Senator Bayh was an eloquent and 
learned champion of sweeping institutional re-
form to make sure that the Constitution safe-
guards democratic principles rather than anti-
quated structures rooted in an undemocratic 
past. At this moment of profound constitutional 
stress and recurring global and domestic 
threats to democratic values and practices, we 
should remember the Senator’s passionate 
commitment to building democratic self-gov-
ernment that serves as an instrument of the 
common good. Senator Bayh recognized that, 
in order to make sure that all votes count in 
our presidential elections and all votes count 
equally, it will be necessary to abolish the 
electoral college—or at least transform it 
through the National Popular Vote interstate 
agreement. I was honored to work with Sen-
ator Bayh, who was a great gentleman and 
patriot, during my time as a State Senator and 
he definitely helped us to make Maryland the 
first state to pass the National Popular Vote 
Agreement. 
Madam Speaker, I wish to include in the 
RECORD a speech by New York Times Edi-
torial Board Member Jesse Wegman for the 
annual Birch Bayh Lecture given at University 
of Indiana McKinney School of Law in honor 
of Senator Bayh’s historic efforts towards elec-
toral reform and in recognition of the melan-
choly day of defeat of the popular vote in the 
Senate on September 29, 1969.

September 29, 2020 
THE BIRCH BAYH LECTURE 
(By Jesse Wegman) 
I’d like to thank everyone for having me 
today: the McKinney School of Law commu-
nity, 
Dean 
Bravo, 
Assistant 
Dean 
MacDougall and, of course, the Bayh family, 
especially Kitty Bayh, who has been so gen-
erous with her time, her assistance and her 
memories over the past few years. 
I am honored to give the first Birch Bayh 
lecture since his passing in March of last 
year. And while I’m sad not to be with you 
in person, I think it’s very appropriate for 
this talk to be taking place on September 17, 
Constitution Day—the day in 1787 that the 
framers in Philadelphia signed the charter 
they had spent the past four months drawing 
up, arguing about, threatening to walk out 
over—and yet still, in the end, agreeing to 
sign and take the next step in this audacious 
new experiment in self-government. 
It’s appropriate because in any conversa-
tion about the nation’s founders, we must in-
clude the name Birch Bayh. He shares with 
James Madison, the father of the Constitu-
tion, the distinction of being the only Ameri-
cans to have authored more than one suc-
cessful amendment to that document. This is 
not an easy task. More than 11,000 amend-
ments have been proposed over the centuries, 
and only 27 have been adopted. 
I will note that when Birch Bayh pushed 
through his first amendment, the 25th, he 
was just 36 years old—the same age Madison 
was that summer in Philadelphia. 
So, now that we’ve put Senator Bayh in his 
proper place in American history, I’d like to 
begin by reading you a short section of my 
book. (To be fair, this is not included in the 
book, although as I’ll explain, I really wish 
it had been.) 
The Aero Commander 680, a twin-engine 
prop, descended through heavy fog as it ap-
proached Barnes Airport, in western Massa-
chusetts. It was late Friday evening, June 19, 
1964. On board were two junior United States 
senators, Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts and 
Birch Bayh of Indiana, along with Bayh’s 
first wife, Marvella, and an aide to Kennedy 
named Ed Moss. 
The four were en route from Washington, 
D.C., to the Massachusetts Democratic Con-
vention in Springfield, where Bayh was to 
give the keynote speech. They had planned 
to leave the capital earlier in the afternoon, 
but were held up by the Senate’s long-de-
layed vote on the landmark Civil Rights Act, 
which finally passed at around 7:40 p.m. 
(Both Kennedy and Bayh voted yes.) 
By the time the Aero Commander took off, 
the day’s calm weather had turned. Thunder-
storms dotted the route, and the pilot, Ed 
Zimny, had to weave his way around the rain 
and winds. As the plane descended, it was 
knocked around like a pin˜ ata. ‘‘It seemed so 
dark and foggy,’’ Marvella told a reporter a 
few days later. ‘‘I whispered to my husband, 
‘Aren’t we in trouble?’ ’’ He replied, ‘‘Oh, no, 
we’re doing fine.’’ 
As 
soon 
as 
they 
broke 
beneath 
the 
cloudline at 600 feet, it was clear something 
was very wrong. Bayh looked out the window 
and saw a black line approaching. ‘‘I thought 
it was another storm, but it was the tops of 
trees,’’ he said. 
They had flown directly into an apple or-
chard. The plane skidded along ‘‘like a to-
boggan,’’ as Kennedy put it, until the left 
wing snagged on a larger tree, cartwheeling 
the aircraft to the left and shearing off parts 
of both wings. The plane came to a stop on 
a hill three miles short of the runway, its il-
luminated beacon slowly spinning, its nose 
crumpled like a soda can. 
‘‘I remember mosquitoes coming in and ab-
solute silence,’’ Kennedy recalled. The si-
lence was broken by the sound of Marvella’s 
voice calling out for her husband, who had 
managed to free himself from his seat belt 
and escape through a broken window. Bayh’s 
stomach was badly bruised and his right arm 
was numb, but with his left arm he dragged 
Marvella out through the window and laid 
her on the grass. He then returned to the 
plane and called out, ‘‘Are you all right up 
there?’’ Kennedy could hear, but he couldn’t 
move or answer. 
Bayh headed off to find help, then became 
aware of the smell of gasoline. ‘‘The plane 
might catch on fire,’’ he said, running back. 
Hearing this, Kennedy found his voice. ‘‘I’m 
still alive!’’ he cried. Bayh reached in and 
maneuvered him out through the window, 
probably saving the 32-year-old’s life. 
‘‘It’s not the kind of crash you’re supposed 
to walk away from,’’ Bayh told reporters 
afterward. 
Years later, he still couldn’t believe what 
he’d done. ‘‘We’ve all heard adrenaline sto-
ries about how a mother can lift a car off a 
trapped infant,’’ he said. ‘‘Well, Kennedy was 
no small guy, and I was able to lug him out 
of there like a sack of corn under my arm.’’ 
After extracting his wife and his fellow 
lawmaker, Bayh limped down to the road 
and tried to flag down a passing car. Nine 
drove by before a pickup truck stopped. Am-
bulances soon followed, and took the pas-
sengers to a nearby hospital. Zimny, the 
pilot, was dead on arrival. Kennedy’s aide, 
Ed Moss, died a few hours later. Kennedy’s 
back was broken in six places, his lung was 
collapsed and he had significant internal 
bleeding. He would remain in the hospital for 
six months, much of it in traction. Birch and 
Marvella Bayh were shaken and bruised, but 
basically unhurt. 
Okay, so I thought that was a fun way to 
start a chapter: a plane crash! Two US sen-
ators! Dragging people to safety! 
My editor read it and said, no. 
As anyone who’s a writer knows, ‘‘No’’ is 
often the most painful and yet most nec-
essary word you can hear. So naturally, I 
pushed back, pleading to keep this story in. 
My editor said, Jesse, all the parts of your 
book need to contribute to the central argu-
ment. This does not do that. It’s not rel-
evant. You know how it would be relevant? If 
Birch Bayh crawled out of the smoking 
wreckage and said, by God, I have to abolish 
the Electoral College! 
It was hard to accept, but he was right. All 
stories need to be streamlined, to be directed 
so the listeners can follow along. In that re-
gard, editors are essential. They help you 
find that central thread and follow it, always 
focusing on what’s important. 
The problem for Birch Bayh was that ev-
erything was important. For him, all the 
parts *did* contribute to the central argu-
ment. 
Imagine an editor confronting this: The 
youngest Speaker in Indiana history; the au-
thor of two constitutional amendments; the 
Senate sponsor of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment; the author of Title IX; the Bayh-Dole 
Act; and on and on and on. 
And on top of that, he literally walked 
away from a plane crash? I mean, come on. 
He pulled his wife out of the burning wreck-
age. He pulled out Ted Kennedy. He saved 
lives. 
An editor would say, stop! Hold up! No one 
will be able to follow all this. Cut. 
Birch Bayh didn’t cut. He just kept adding. 
His life filled with a spirit of democracy and 
inclusion, a commitment to a better, fairer, 
more just, more humane, more equal Amer-
ica. So while I’m a firm believer in strong 
editing, I’m grateful Birch Bayh didn’t have 
an editor. 
And I keep coming back to that night in 
June 1964. 
The accident made the front page of the 
next morning’s New York Times, right next 
to the lead report on the Senate’s passage of 
the civil-rights bill. The headline read: ‘‘Sen-
ator Kennedy Hurt In Air Crash; Bayh In-
jured, Too.’’ 
Of course Kennedy got top billing. He was 
the brother of a fallen president and a rising 
member of the nation’s most prominent po-
litical dynasty. Bayh, despite his late-night 
heroics, was unknown to most Americans. At 
36, he was not yet two years into his first 
term as senator. Had he died that night, like 
most people do when their airplane crashes, 
he would have been remembered as a genial, 
progressive Indiana politician who got along 
well with his colleagues. But he didn’t die. 
And the fluke of his survival turned out to 
be one of those moments on which history 
pivots. Over the decade following the crash, 
Bayh would find himself at the center of the 
nation’s biggest constitutional debates, and 
in the process he became one of the most in-
fluential lawmakers in American history. 
As I said, Birch Bayh holds a rare distinc-
tion: he is the only American other than 
James Madison to have spearheaded multiple 
successful amendments to the Constitution. 
He has two under his belt so far: the 25th, 
adopted in 1967 to lay down clear rules for re-
placing a president or vice president who 
dies, resigns or becomes unable to govern; 
and the 26th, adopted in 1971 to lower the 
voting age to 18 from 21. He may yet to claim 
credit for a third—the Equal Protection 
Amendment, which would prohibit discrimi-
nation on the basis of sex, and for which 
Bayh was the lead Senate sponsor. With his 
help, the ERA passed Congress in 1972. Last 
year it got its 38th state ratification— 
enough (in theory, at least) for it to become 
the 28th Amendment. 
Bayh’s almost unequalled record of con-
stitutional reform speaks for itself, but the 
amendment that would have had the most 
profound effect on the structure of American 
government and society was the one he 
failed to pass—the one that got away, as his 
staffers called it. 
Between 1966 and 1970, the young Indiana 
senator led a vigorous, high-profile campaign 
to abolish the Electoral College and elect the 
president by direct popular vote—a goal he 
came closer to achieving than anyone since 
the 1787 convention in Philadelphia. 
Back then, it was a Pennsylvania delegate 
named James Wilson, the most respected 
lawyer in the country, who pushed through-
out the summer for a direct vote. Like Wil-
son, Senator Bayh fought hard and came up 
short. Like Wilson, he was blocked by south-
ern politicians intent on protecting their 
outsized power, which they had seized and 
maintained through two centuries of system-
atic racial violence and subjugation. 
Unlike Wilson, however, Senator Bayh 
didn’t start out as a believer in the popular 
vote. He favored modest tweaks to the Elec-
toral College, not a complete overhaul. Then 
he learned more about the College’s histor-
ical unfairness and the harms it continued to 
inflict on American politics. Within months, 
he became a convert to the cause of a direct 
presidential election. And but for a handful 
of Senate votes one late September after-
noon in 1970, he may well have converted the 
nation. 
Did you know about any of this? I didn’t. 
Nor did most of the people I’ve asked over 
the last few years, many of whom were po-
litically active adults in the late 1960s. What 
explains this mass amnesia? An effort like 
Bayh’s on an issue like the Electoral College 
should be burned into America’s history 
books. But like Wilson’s valiant but unsuc-
cessful push for a popular vote in Philadel-
phia, Bayh’s has almost completely dis-
appeared down the public memory hole. I’d 
like to pull it back up and see what it can 
teach us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E888 
September 29, 2020 
I’ve spoken about Birch Bayh’s astonishing 
record of accomplishment. But as someone 
who grew up following Boston sports in the 
1970s and 1980s, I have always been less at-
tuned to the successes than to the failures, 
to the near misses. 
So in this talk I want to focus on the one 
that got away: The Electoral College amend-
ment. 
Obviously this matters to me because I 
wrote a book about it. But, if I may, I also 
feel a sort of kinship with Senator Bayh. He 
did not begin as a radical constitutional re-
former. After several years, however, he 
found himself where virtually everyone who 
spends that much time studying the elec-
toral College does: as an unabashed advocate 
for a popular vote. 
In following his journey of discovery into 
the way we choose our president, I found my-
self on a similar track: one of skepticism 
that transformed into full-on belief. 
I will start in the early 1960s, with Birch 
Bayh as a first-year senator from Indiana 
looking to make a name for himself in the 
world’s greatest deliberative body. I’m going 
to tell a shorter version of the story that’s in 
Chapter 5 of my book: 
Despite its important-sounding name, the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee’s 
Sub-
committee on Constitutional Amendments 
was a sleepy affair in 1963. 
In theory it had a significant role to play— 
drafting amendments to the Constitution 
and introducing them into Congress to be 
voted on—but in practice the subcommittee 
had done little of note since the days of Pro-
hibition. When its longtime chair, Estes 
Kefauver, died of a heart attack that August, 
no one immediately stepped up to take his 
place. The job wasn’t that appealing. 
‘‘It was a graveyard,’’ Bayh recalled years 
later. ‘‘How often do you amend the Con-
stitution, for heaven’s sakes?’’ (For the 
record: 27 times, the first 10 of which, known 
collectively as the Bill of Rights, were 
adopted almost before the original Constitu-
tion’s ink was dry. Since then, we’ve ratified 
a new amendment on average once every 13 
years.) 
Bayh also knew that sitting on a com-
mittee was the best way for a young senator 
to gain power and influence. By the middle 
of 1963, only a few months after getting 
elected to the Senate for the first time, Bayh 
had maneuvered his way onto the Judiciary 
Committee. It was a prestigious post that in-
volved interviewing Supreme Court nomi-
nees, among many other high-profile respon-
sibilities. The problem for Bayh was that he 
didn’t want to be just a member of a gang; he 
wanted to lead one, and all the Judiciary’s 
subcommittee chairmanships were spoken 
for. Then Estes Kefauver died. 
Bayh 
didn’t 
volunteer 
to 
take 
over 
Kefauver’s seat at first, because it wasn’t 
being offered. James Eastland, the Judiciary 
Committee chairman, had begun the process 
of shuttering the subcommittee entirely. By 
chance, Kefauver’s former chief of staff knew 
of Bayh’s ambitions and suggested that he go 
to Eastland in person and make the case for 
saving it. In a 2009 interview, Bayh remem-
bered his first meeting with Eastland, a 
staunch segregationist from Mississippi: 
So I got an appointment and saw Senator 
Eastland. He got a little scotch and ice. I 
didn’t really drink at the time, but I may 
have taken a sip or two of it. And I made my 
pitch: ‘‘Mr. Chairman, when I went to law 
school, constitutional law was my most ex-
citing subject. Boy, it would be my dream 
come true if I could be Chairman of that 
Subcommittee.’’ 
He said, ‘‘Well, Birch, I hope you under-
stand here, but Allen Ellender [a conserv-
ative senator from Louisiana] has been giv-
ing us a rough time. I sort of told him I’d 
close this down. I hope you understand, 
boy.’’ 
I said, ‘‘Mr. Chairman, I’d even put one of 
my own staff people there. It wouldn’t cost 
you a nickel.’’ 
‘‘I just made up my mind, Birch. I hope 
you understand.’’ 
‘‘Thank you, Mr. Chairman,’’ and I left. 
The next morning, 9:00, my secretary said, 
‘‘You’ve got Chairman Eastland on the 
phone.’’ 
‘‘Birch?’’ 
‘‘Yes, Mr. Chairman.’’ 
‘‘I want you to be Chairman of that Sub-
committee. I think you’d be a good one.’’ 
Click. 
Whenever else could a plantation owner, 
one step away from being a slave master, an 
avowed segregationist, ever do anything to 
get a little chit with a liberal young turk 
like me? 
If Bayh had any pretensions about the new 
job, they were snuffed out fast. Eastland, 
who had apparently taken Bayh’s won’t-cost- 
a-nickel promise literally, parked the sub-
committee and its small staff in a converted 
men’s room on the third floor of the Capitol 
building. Jay Berman, an aide and later the 
senator’s chief of staff, described it to me. 
‘‘It had no windows and it was very small. No 
claustrophobic could’ve worked there.’’ 
On the plus side, the toilets had been re-
moved. 
In politics as in life, everything can change 
in an instant. Bayh was officially named 
chair on September 30. Fifty-three days 
later, President John F. Kennedy was assas-
sinated. And just like that, a graveyard job 
run out of a bathroom was about to become 
one of the most important in the country. 
Bayh was faced with a suddenly urgent 
challenge: what to do if a president becomes 
incapacitated while in office? Previous presi-
dents had informal arrangements in place to 
deal with such a scenario, but the Constitu-
tion itself provided no next steps. It said 
only that if a president can’t serve, the vice 
president takes over, and any further details 
can be hammered out by Congress. 
The nation was still absorbing the shock of 
Kennedy’s death when Bayh got to work. On 
December 12, he introduced a resolution to 
amend the Constitution by adding clear rules 
for presidential and vice presidential succes-
sion in cases of emergency. 
Under Bayh’s guidance, the bill passed 
both houses of Congress and went out to the 
states for ratification. The Twenty-Fifth 
Amendment went into effect a little more 
than three years after Bayh first introduced 
it. It was a remarkable accomplishment for a 
junior senator who, in the words of a 1970 
New York Times profile, ‘‘had flunked his 
bar exam the first time and had practiced 
law only a couple of months before coming 
to Washington.’’ 
Bayh’s 
success 
on 
the 
Twenty-Fifth 
Amendment transformed him into a re-
spected lawmaker whose opinions mattered, 
particularly when it came to the Constitu-
tion. 
That’s why President Lyndon Johnson 
turned to him for his next big project: 
amending the Electoral College. 
There have been, since the nation’s found-
ing, roughly 800 attempts to amend or abol-
ish the Electoral College. With the exception 
of one—the 12th Amendment—all have failed. 
So what was Lyndon Johnson trying to do? 
He was trying to save the Democratic 
party from insurgent southerners who were 
peeling off as the party turned against seg-
regation and toward civil rights. Longtime 
Democrats like Strom Thurmond in South 
Carolina were not fans of racial equality, and 
they were running third-party campaigns to 
try to undercut the national party. 
Across the south, they urged electors to be 
‘‘faithless’’—that is, to break their pledges 
to vote for the Democratic nominee in favor 
of third-party segregationist candidates like 
Harry Byrd. This alarmed the leadership of 
both major parties, and especially President 
Johnson, whose support depended on south-
ern Democrats. So he asked Birch Bayh to 
take the lead on drafting an amendment that 
would eliminate the risk of faithless elec-
tors. 
Senator Bayh took up the challenge. In 
February 1966, he held the subcommittee’s 
first hearing on amending the Electoral Col-
lege. 
Right out of the gate, he shot down any 
prospect of abolition. ‘‘Putting it optimisti-
cally,’’ he said in his opening remarks, the 
chances of Congress passing a popular-vote 
amendment were ‘‘extremely slim, if not 
hopeless.’’ 
And yet, a few months later, after ques-
tioning multiple witnesses, reading thou-
sands of pages of archival and statistical 
documents, Senator Bayh realized he had 
been wrong. He was aiming too low, getting 
trapped in the details of endless debates 
about ratios and percentages. He was miss-
ing the bigger picture. 
Bayh had come to see, as he would later 
quote from the historian John Roche, that 
the College was ‘‘merely a jerry-rigged im-
provisation which has subsequently been en-
dowed with a high theoretical content.’’ 
On top of that, the nation in the early 1960s 
was in the midst of a democratic awakening. 
From the civil rights movement to the one- 
person-one-vote cases at the Supreme Court, 
from the abolition of the poll tax to the Vot-
ing Rights Act, America’s long history of ra-
cial discrimination and exclusion from the 
ballot box was being challenged like never 
before. Birch Bayh wasn’t just sensitive to 
all of this, he was energized by it. And when 
he looked at that bigger picture, the prob-
lems with the Electoral College seemed 
much more serious. 
Jay Berman, Bayh’s staffer, recalled to me 
the feeling that emerged after months of 
hearings. ‘‘All of a sudden, you’re in the 
weeds and people are saying, ‘You’re amend-
ing the Constitution for this?’ Look, we have 
fundamental issues here. We’ve expended so 
much time and effort to expand the fran-
chise. You’ve been involved in all these civil 
rights bills. What are the consequences for 
the present system if the person with the 
most votes doesn’t win? What was all this 
about if it doesn’t mean that every vote 
should count?’’ 
On May 18, after months of hearings and 
expert witnesses and statistical reports, 
Birch Bayh stood up on the floor of the Sen-
ate and gave what I consider one of the 
strongest and most eloquent arguments for 
the popular vote in the nation’s history. I 
will quote from it at length, because his 
words are full of hope and inspiration, and 
they deserve being repeated. 
Mr. President, from the inception of our 
nation, controversy and complexity has sur-
rounded the question of how to choose the 
President of the United States. 
Indeed, one of the framers of the Constitu-
tion, James Wilson, described this problem 
as ‘‘the most difficult of all’’ to resolve at 
the Convention. . . . 
Bayh acknowledged the hundreds of failed 
efforts to fix the system, then he said, 
Today, Mr. President, the situation is dif-
ferent. Today, for the first time in our his-
tory, we have achieved the goal of universal 
suffrage regardless of race, religion or sta-
tion in life . . . . 
Today, the next logical outgrowth of the 
persistent and inevitable movement toward 
the democratic ideal is the popular election

September 29, 2020 
of our national officers—an election in which 
each person has the right to vote for Presi-
dent without an artificial barrier separating 
him from the choice of his Chief Executive. 
. . . 
Bayh then noted that the subcommittee 
had considered many different amendment 
proposals, before rejecting them all. 
It may well be that mere procedural 
changes in the present system would be like 
shifting around the parts of a creaky and 
dangerous automobile engine, making it no 
less creaky and no less dangerous. What we 
may need is a new engine, Mr. President, be-
cause we are in a new age. 
. . . Some may say this proposal is too 
new, too radical a break with tradition. In 
all honesty, Mr. President, I was among that 
number only a few short months ago. Then, 
we began hearings on the problem. I con-
sulted with scholars in the field. I did a great 
deal of study and reflection. I came to the 
conclusion that this idea was not truly a 
break with tradition at all. It was, in fact, a 
logical, realistic and proper continuation of 
this nation’s tradition and history—a tradi-
tion of continuous expansion of the franchise 
and equality in voting. 
He ran through the list: ending property 
qualifications and giving the vote to poorer 
white people; the abolition of slavery and the 
enfranchisement of blacks . . . of women, of 
Jews and Catholics . . . 
Today, we have witnessed the climax of the 
long struggle to guarantee Negroes the right 
to exercise the franchise—the 14th, 15th and 
24th Amendments; the Civil Rights Acts of 
1957, 1960 and 1964, and the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965. 
In fact, we have only one election remain-
ing, Mr. President, wherein some votes are 
not equal to others and wherein millions of 
votes do not count in the final result—and 
that is in the election of the most powerful 
political officer in the world, the President 
of the United States. 
It is not radical to suggest that we abolish 
the Electoral College and elect our President 
by direct popular vote—no more so than if 
we suggested the advantages of grounding an 
open-cockpit biplane in favor of a supersonic 
jet. 
Direct election of the President would 
make that office truly national. We elect our 
local official locally; our Congressmen by 
districts to protect district interests; our 
Governors and Senators statewide. Why 
should we not elect the President and Vice 
President nationally? The President has no 
authority over state government. He cannot 
veto a bill enacted by a state legislature. 
Why then should he be elected by state-cho-
sen electors? He should be elected directly 
by the people, for it is the people of the 
United States to whom he is responsible. 
Direct election would greatly encourage 
voter participation. Today, if a state votes 
traditionally in the column of one party, 
voters of the other party correctly assume 
that their vote will count for naught. Under 
direct election, these votes will be as impor-
tant as votes cast anywhere else. 
In sum, direct popular election brings with 
it many virtues and no vices; it would sub-
stitute clarity for confusion, decisiveness for 
danger, popular choice for political chance. 
Bayh finished with what we would today 
call the ‘‘mic drop’’: 
James Madison, the father of our Constitu-
tion, knew that the President had to be inde-
pendent of the Congress. He knew, also, that 
in deciding upon a means of choosing a 
President 
some 
compromise 
would 
be 
reached. But he had his own ideas as to how 
the President would best be elected. 
Madison said that ‘‘the people at large . . . 
was the fittest in itself.’’ 
We are at long last arriving at the place 
and time in our history where meaning has 
been brought to the preamble of our Con-
stitution—‘‘We, the People of the United 
States . . .’’ Today we are, indeed, ‘‘We, the 
People . . .’’ 
If there was doubt about it in the early 
years of the Republic, there can be no doubt 
today. Let us echo Madison. Let us put our 
trust in the people. 
This was the key. More than any political 
or partisan advantage, Senator Bayh wanted 
what was best for the American people. 
And he people, as it turned out, felt the 
same way. 
On the same day as Bayh’s speech, Gallup’s 
first-ever national poll on a direct vote for 
president found that sixty-three percent of 
Americans said they favored dumping the 
Electoral College for a popular vote. Twenty 
percent opposed it, and 17 percent had no 
opinion. 
Soon the movement had support from 
across the political spectrum—from the 
Chamber of Commerce to the League of 
Women Voters, from organized labor to the 
American Bar Association. In a report that 
would later be quoted in the New York 
Times, the ABA called the Electoral College 
‘‘archaic, undemocratic, complex, ambig-
uous, indirect, and dangerous.’’ 
The range and depth of support for a pop-
ular vote gave Bayh the confidence that he 
was on the right track. Still, he moved cau-
tiously. As the 1968 presidential race heated 
up, he pulled back on the popular vote cam-
paign. Merits aside, any debate over how 
America might choose its president in the 
future would surely get tangled up in the 
politics of how America was choosing its 
president in 1968. 
What Bayh couldn’t know was how much 
that year’s election—and the collective heart 
attack it gave the nation—would help his 
cause. 
The 1968 election was primarily between 
Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey. But it 
was a third-party candidate—George Wal-
lace, the former Alabama governor and arch- 
segregationist—who nearly managed to dead-
lock the vote and force Congress to pick the 
winner. Wallace won the most votes through-
out the deep South, and earned 46 electoral 
votes, the last time any third-party can-
didate has won any at all. His aim was not to 
win the election outright, but to prevent ei-
ther Nixon or Humphrey from winning a ma-
jority of Electoral College votes. In that sce-
nario, the Constitution orders the House of 
Representatives to choose the president, 
with each state getting a single vote. Wal-
lace thought that if both candidates needed 
him to help push them over the top, he could 
make whatever demands he wanted. 
Wallace failed in the end. Nixon won a ma-
jority of electors. But he succeeded in high-
lighting just how bizarre and dangerous the 
Electoral College could be. It was the first 
time millions of Americans had given the 
system a thought. The prospect of an 
unreconstructed racist extorting the presi-
dency horrified them. The best-selling au-
thor James Michener wrote a whole book ad-
vocating a switch to the popular vote. He 
called the Electoral College a ‘‘time bomb 
lodged near the heart of the nation.’’ 
Meanwhile, Birch Bayh was riding the 
wave of the 1968 election, gathering support 
across the country for a major constitu-
tional reform. By the end of that year, polls 
showed more than 80 percent of Americans in 
favor of a national popular vote for presi-
dent. 
In September 1969, the House voted over-
whelmingly to abolish the Electoral College 
and replace it with a direct popular vote. It 
was a bipartisan effort. Even President 
Nixon got on board, and polls of state legis-
latures suggested strong support throughout 
the country. All signs pointed to another 
successful amendment for Mr. Bayh and a 
radical change in the way Americans chose 
their presidents. 
All signs but one. 
As soon as the amendment reached the 
Senate, it was blocked by Southern seg-
regationists, led by Strom Thurmond of 
South Carolina, who were well aware that 
the Electoral College had been created to ap-
pease the slaveholding states. They were also 
aware that it continued to warp the nation’s 
politics in their favor, since millions of 
black voters throughout the South were ef-
fectively disenfranchised by restrictive reg-
istration and voting laws. Even those who 
were able to vote rarely saw their pref-
erences reflected by a single elector. A pop-
ular vote would make their voices equal and 
their votes matter—and would encourage 
them to turn out at higher rates. 
The Southerners delayed and filibustered 
the amendment for months. On Sept. 29, 
1970—50 years ago this month—the last at-
tempt to end the filibuster failed by five 
votes. It was another echo of the way the 
Electoral College had been preserved for the 
benefit of white political power, particularly 
in the south. 
Now here’s the really interesting part. The 
segregationists had help from a key con-
stituency: blacks and ethnic minorities in 
northern cities like New York City and Chi-
cago. Why? Because at the time, New York 
was the nation’s biggest and most important 
swing state. And racial and ethnic minorities 
in the big cities decided how it swung. These 
voters understood that the Electoral College, 
using statewide winner-take-all laws, gave 
them disproportionate power in choosing the 
president. They didn’t want to give up that 
power any more than the southerners did. 
Strom Thurmond took advantage of this 
fact. He sent personal telegrams to promi-
nent black and Jewish leaders, warning them 
of the consequences of supporting a direct 
popular vote. This made Birch Bayh furious. 
Here’s what he said in a 2009 interview: 
He told these groups, ‘‘What you’re going 
to do is, you’re going to give up your advan-
tage to have influence to sway these large 
electoral votes if you have a direct popular 
vote. It will just be confined to one person, 
one vote. You won’t be able to sway that 
whole group of electors,’’ which is true, of 
course. 
A couple of these guys . . . came to my of-
fice and said, ‘‘You’re going to have to back 
away from this.’’ 
I said, ‘‘What do you mean?’’ 
They said, ‘‘Well, it would give us less 
power.’’ 
I finally said—the only time while I was 
there, in my eighteen years—I said, ‘‘Look, I 
busted my tail to see that each of you and 
your constituencies got one person, one vote. 
Now you’re telling me that if you have 1.01, 
you want to keep it? Get your rear ends out 
of my office and don’t come back.’’ 
Senator Bayh reintroduced his Electoral 
College amendment in every session of Con-
gress through the 1970s, until he lost re-elec-
tion in 1980. 
With Bayh’s departure, the Senate lost its 
best advocate for a national popular vote. 
‘‘No one was a better legislator than he was 
and he couldn’t get it done,’’ Jay Berman 
told me. ‘‘It’s just such an empty feeling be-
cause it was so right to do. And we couldn’t 
do it.’’ 
For the final portion of this talk, I’d like 
jump forward a half century, to today. The 
21st century is barely two decades old, and 
yet it has already been defined by the Elec-
toral College’s anti-majoritarian distortions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E890 
September 29, 2020 
It happened first on Nov. 7, 2000, when Vice 
President Al Gore was the choice of the 
American people, with more than half a mil-
lion more votes around the country than 
George W. Bush. But Bush won the White 
House thanks to a few hundred ballots in 
Florida, and a recount stopped short by the 
Supreme Court. 
It happened again in 2016. Two times in 
less than two decades. And there’s a very 
plausible chance it could happen again in No-
vember. 
If Senator Bayh were here, I know he 
would say this is a crisis for our democracy. 
It is a crisis for our republic. 
In fact I don’t have to speculate. He stayed 
deeply involved in the politics of electoral 
reform after leaving the Senate. In 2005, a 
team of lawyers and activists devised a plan 
to elect the president by a national popular 
vote, not by abolishing the Electoral College 
but by using it exactly as it was designed in 
the Constitution. They came to Washington 
to test the political waters, to see whether 
they could get support for this plan. The 
first person they spoke to was Birch Bayh. 
I was lucky enough to meet the senator— 
two years ago this week, at his home on the 
eastern shore of Maryland. It was the last 
interview he gave before his death. We were 
joined by his wonderful wife, Kitty, and 
Kevin Feely, one of his longtime Senate 
staffers. 
When I asked him about his early life, he 
recalled a childhood spent working on his 
grandparents’ farm in Terre Haute. ‘‘Nobody 
in my family background had ever been in-
volved in politics,’’ he said. ‘‘When my father 
found out what I was doing, I think he won-
dered what he’d done wrong as a parent.’’ 
On the topic of the popular-vote amend-
ment, the pain of the loss was still there. If 
anything, it was keener, now that the Elec-
toral College has awarded the White House 
to two popular-vote losers in the past two 
decades. 
‘‘I don’t know,’’ he told me when I asked 
how he thought of the issue today. ‘‘I like to 
think as a country, as we grow older, we 
learn. It just makes such good sense.’’ 
I asked about the familiar charge that 
eliminating the Electoral College would lead 
to ‘‘mob rule.’’ He was nonplussed. As he saw 
it, the ‘‘mob’’ was the American people. He 
said, ‘‘That, to me, is the positive end of it. 
Why shouldn’t they be able to determine 
their own destiny?’’ 
This was emblematic of Bayh’s broader 
commitment to fairness, equality and inclu-
sion. Birch Bayh’s America is a big, open, 
welcoming place. It has room for everyone, 
and it treats all of us as equals. 
I think it’s fair to say that Birch Bayh was 
one of this nation’s founding fathers. He 
changed the country for the better, and he 
would have done even more if he could. The 
fact that he didn’t succeed in changing how 
we choose our President . . . well, Madison 
didn’t get everything he wanted either. But 
the seeds have been planted. 
Speaking of seeds, I found a short article 
about Senator Bayh in a Reader’s Digest 
from November 1948. It was titled ‘‘GI Am-
bassador.’’ 
Of course, we know that the senator was 
raised in a farming family, and had a knack 
for the work. When he was a teenager, he 
won $200 for the best teenaged tomato patch 
in the state. So, when he joined the army 
and learned he was being shipped overseas to 
help with the recovery effort, what’s the 
first thing he did? 
He ordered seeds. ‘‘Please send at once $4 
worth of vegetable garden seeds,’’ he wrote 
to the county agent in Terre Haute. ‘‘Be sure 
to put in some sweet corn.’’ 
He got 18 packets in the mail. But when he 
showed up for inspection, he nearly lost 
them all. ‘‘Regulations state that you can 
take only military equipment and personal 
belongings,’’ his sergeant said. ‘‘But vege-
table seeds—get rid of ’em!’’ 
So he broke open each packet and emptied 
its contents into a different pocket on his 
uniform. When he arrived in the small Ger-
man village where he was stationed, he slow-
ly redistributed the seeds into their 18 pack-
ets. ‘‘It was quite a job,’’ he said. ‘‘But I did 
want a garden.’’ 
He helped build 45 garden plots and got 2 
village children to tend each plot. By the end 
of the growing season, they’d produced 
mountains of cabbage, beans, spinach, tur-
nips, tomatoes, cucumbers, beets, lettuce, 
kale, chard . . . and sweet corn. The village 
was fed all winter. 
In an interview years later, he said, ‘‘The 
thing I love about agriculture is that it’s 
pretty hard to get away from the facts. 
There it is. Mother Nature takes care of it. 
If you do something wrong, you pay.’’ 
Birch Bayh was a farmer of democracy. He 
planted the seeds of a more equal and more 
just America. He helped us cultivate a na-
tional debate by connecting our modern lives 
to the fundamental principle of universal 
human equality embedded in the Declaration 
of Independence. 
This was not a dry intellectual exercise for 
him. Bayh’s conviction was profound, and his 
inability to achieve a national popular vote 
pained him deeply for the rest of his life. It 
was, he would say, the single greatest dis-
appointment of his career. 
As an example, in the fall of 2000, John 
Feerick, the former dean of Fordham Law 
School and an instrumental figure in the 
passage of the 25th Amendment, was teach-
ing a seminar at Georgetown Law School, 
and invited Senator Bayh as a guest speaker. 
Bayh visited the class in October. In a few 
weeks, the nation would be upended with the 
drama and chaos of a contested election—the 
recount in Florida, the butterfly ballot, the 
hanging chads, the Brooks Brothers riot. . . 
and finally, a tense resolution by the Su-
preme Court, giving George W. Bush a bare 
Electoral College majority, and sending the 
first popular-vote loser to the White House 
in more than a century. 
All of that was in the future when Feerick, 
sitting next to Bayh in his law-school sem-
inar, posed what seemed at the time like an 
innocent hypothetical. 
‘‘I put the question to him,’’ Feerick said, 
‘‘ ‘What do you think the reaction of the 
American people will be if there’s a dif-
ference between the electoral vote and the 
popular vote winner?’ ’’ 
‘‘And his response to me was that the peo-
ple would accept the legal system we have, 
and the outcome of that system. The one we 
have. And then he started to cry.’’ 
I want to return a final time to the words 
Birch Bayh spoke on the Senate floor in 1966. 
A national popular vote is ‘‘a logical, real-
istic and proper continuation of this nation’s 
tradition and history—a tradition of contin-
uous expansion of the franchise and equality 
in voting.’’ 
That is the essence. In my book I write, 
‘‘Maybe 
this 
is 
the 
real 
American 
exceptionalism: our nation was conceived 
out of the audacious, world-changing idea of 
universal human equality. And though it was 
born in a snarl of prejudice, mistrust, and ex-
clusion, it harbored in its DNA the code to 
express more faithfully the true meaning of 
its founding principles. Over multiple gen-
erations, and thanks to the tireless work and 
bloody sacrifices of millions of Americans— 
some powerful but most just regular people 
who wanted to be treated the same as every-
one else—that code has been unlocked, and 
those principles, slowly but surely, have 
found expression.’’ 
I believe a central reason Birch Bayh’s ef-
fort in the late 1960s came so close was that 
this was his argument. It was irrefutable, 
and it resonated with millions of Americans. 
Now here we are, 50 years later, facing the 
same questions he faced, fighting the same 
battles he fought, and relying all along on 
his wisdom, his vision and his humanity to 
help us find our way to an answer—and to a 
more perfect Union.

HONORING RECOLOGY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Recology in 
celebration of its 100th anniversary on Sep-
tember 20, 2020. 
Since its founding in San Francisco in 1920, 
Recology has become a leader in resource re-
covery and landfill diversion. As a result of its 
commitment to Waste Zero, Recology has 
worked to reduce the amount of accumulated 
waste by converting the waste that they collect 
for reuse, recycling, composting, or energy 
generation. Recology has expanded its efforts 
to cover over 140 communities in California, 
Oregon, and Washington. 
Recology is not just a leader in waste man-
agement, but also a leader in employee own-
ership. Since 1986, Recology has been 100 
percent employee-owned and is now one of 
the nation’s ten largest fully employee-owned 
companies. Recology’s efforts to empower its 
employees through employee ownership has 
especially served to empower female and mi-
nority employees, who currently hold a major-
ity of the company’s shares. 
Recology has become an integral part of my 
own Congressional district in California, with 
offices and facilities in Santa Rosa and Vallejo 
employing 135 employee-owners. Not only 
has Recology helped communities in my dis-
trict with its commitment to Waste Zero and 
employee ownership, but it has also continued 
to give back through participation in civic en-
gagement projects and community organiza-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, Recology emulates the 
type of company that we should expect from 
all American companies. Recology is a cor-
porate leader in environmental sustainability, 
employee ownership, and community involve-
ment within countless communities. It is there-
fore fitting and proper that we honor Recology 
here today as they celebrate their 100th anni-
versary.

up, he was a member of both the Cub Scouts 
and Boy Scouts before beginning high school. 
He graduated from Shippensburg High School 
in 1962, and from the Barber School Harris-
burg the following year. He was a member of 
the AV Club in addition to the proud owner of 
a 1952 Chevy Coupe, his first car. Jake start-
ed his work for Community Action in 1968, 
working part-time until 1970. He returned in 
1972 as a full-time Community Development 
Coordinator working from the Shippensburg lo-
cation, and has been with the agency since, 
becoming Housing Counselor in 1994. With 
Community Action, Jake has helped thou-
sands achieve their goals, connecting first- 
time homebuyers to needed resources, and 
promoting economic self-sufficiency. 
While working for Community Action, he 
managed to balance a litany of other roles that 
serve as a testament to his character. He 
worked at both the Carlisle and Chambersburg 
Hospitals in the 1980s and 90s, graduated Co-
lumbia School of Broadcasting in 1980, and 
honed his craft at WSHP radio, all while own-
ing his own business—JB’s Disc Jockey Serv-
ice, which operated into the 2000s. 
Jake is a cancer survivor of 26 years, and 
remains active in marching bands while being 
a world-renowned Masters Powerlifting Cham-
pion. He is a member of the Reilly Raiders 
Drum & Bugle Corps and the leader of the 
Dungeon Powerlifting Crew at the Front Street 
YMCA, holding numerous world records for his 
age group. Jake is also a member of the Mt. 
Pisgah AME Zion Church and the Locus 
Grove Cemetery Committee Firefighter Vigilant 
Hose Company No. 52. He loves gardening, 
the LA Dodgers, trains, fireworks, motorcycles, 
books, firearms, mini whiskey bottles, music, 
and enjoys collecting African-American relics. 
Jake will tell you that his biggest and proud-
est accomplishment, by far, is his family. He is 
the proud father of five children (Andrew, Ger-
ald, Mike, Kacey, and Ashley), 11 grand-
children, and 2 great-grandchildren. Jake has 
lived his life by his personal mantra: ‘‘Never 
stop learning. Live everyday as if it were your 
last. Put your faith in God and never give up.’’ 
With great honor, I commend Gerald ‘‘Jake’’ 
Burke’s distinguished career of service to Tri- 
County Community Action, the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania, and the United States of 
America.

HONORING THE FAITHFUL SERV-
ICE OF ASSISTANT CHIEF DEP-
UTY DOUGLASS TACKETT 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the service of As-
sistant Chief Deputy Douglass Tackett. 
Mr. Tackett began his career in law enforce-
ment as part of the Army Military Police 
Corps. Upon leaving the Army, he transitioned 
to working in civilian law enforcement with the 
Montgomery County Sheriff’s Department. On 
account of his persistent work ethic, he quickly 
rose through the ranks, serving as Jail Admin-
istrator, Lieutenant, Captain, and finally as As-
sistant Chief Deputy. 
Charged with the supervision of the hun-
dreds of inmates housed in the Montgomery 
County Jail on a daily basis, Assistant Chief 
Deputy Tackett sought to maintain order and 
discipline while trying to aid inmates who 
wanted to change their ways. His constant fi-
delity and excellence throughout his career 
stands as an example to be followed by all 
those who are charged with upholding law and 
order. 
Assistant Chief Deputy Tackett’s four dec-
ades of service to the Montgomery County 
Sheriff’s office have been invaluable and he 
has made an impact in his community for 
years to come. His service exemplifies the vir-
tues of steadfastness and dedication. It is fit-
ting that we honor him as he concludes a long 
and faithful career in service to the people of 
Montgomery County. On behalf of the United 
States Congress, I wish to commend Assistant 
Chief Deputy Tackett for his service, and I 
congratulate him on the occasion of his retire-
ment from the Montgomery County Sheriff’s 
office.

RETIREMENT OF DANIEL SPATZ 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Daniel Spatz as he retires after 12 
years as the Washington, D.C. Trip Scheduler 
for The Dalles Community Outreach Team. 
Daniel’s dedication, diligence, and passion to 
support others has helped make the Commu-
nity Outreach Team the success it is today. 
Dan was born in Portland, Oregon and 
raised outside of White Salmon, Washington, 
and graduated from Columbia High School. 
He went on to earn his degree in journalism 
and business from Eastern Oregon State Col-
lege after working at The White Salmon Enter-
prise as a high school student. After college, 
Dan began his career in the newspaper busi-
ness working for every other newspaper in the 
Columbia River Gorge: Hood River News, 
Goldendale Sentinel, The Dalles Reminder, 
and lastly, The Dalles Chronicle. During this 
time, Dan learned all the nuances of news-
paper production including running a printing 
press, running advertisement sales, directing 
news meetings, writing for publication, and ul-
timately serving as an editor and general man-
ager. Additionally, he became an award-win-
ning journalist recognized by both the National 
Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA) 
and the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Asso-
ciation (ONPA). 
While working at The Dalles Reminder, Dan 
met his wife, Michele, when he interviewed 
her for a news story. Together they built a 
family and raised two daughters, Melissa and 
Kathryn, who are now, respectively, a general 
surgeon and an emergency room physician. In 
fact, Dan and Michele have always shared a 
welcoming home, especially since they devel-
oped a high school student exchange program 
between The Dalles and its sister city, Miyoshi 
City, Japan. For several years the Spatz home 
has served as a homestay family and hosted 
numerous Miyoshi City students, visitors, and 
adult chaperones. 
After 30 years in regional journalism, Dan 
left to join Columbia Gorge Community Col-
lege (CGCC) as their Chief Institutional Ad-
vancement Officer where he serves today as 
the Executive Director of Institutional Advance-
ment. His outstanding accomplishments at 
CGCC include negotiating intergovernmental 
agreements securing $14.6 million for capital 
construction programs to build the Treaty 
Oaks Skills Center and student housing on 
The Dalles CGCC campus. Dan also sup-
ported CGCC’s Hispanic Serving Institution 
designation by creating and facilitating the col-
lege’s Latinx Advisory Council, which rep-
resents community organizations, school dis-
tricts, and other groups with a mission to iden-
tify barriers to college recruitment, retention, 
and academic completion of Latinx students. 
Additionally, as Chief Institutional Advance-
ment Officer, Dan embraced the task of 
scheduling the Community Outreach Team’s 
complement of Washington, D.C. meetings 
that occur each March and September. He 
was also instrumental in helping CGCC re-
ceive funding for a new National Guard Readi-
ness Center, a Wind Energy Technician Train-
ing program, new 911 dispatch equipment for 
Wasco County, and construction dollars for 
The Dalles’ East Gateway Project. Dan se-
cured meetings with Oregon and Washington 
Legislators, the American Wind Energy Asso-
ciation, the Department of Energy, and the 
Department of Education enabling the Com-
munity Outreach Team to advocate for and ul-
timately receive funding for these important 
community projects. Dan was also an integral 
member of the Community Outreach Team 
itself and made many trips to Washington, 
D.C. as a representative of CGCC and the 
City of The Dalles. 
Finally, over the last two decades, Dan has 
also served in several other key leadership 
positions within The Dalles and Wasco Coun-
ty. From 2008 to 2016, he was elected to The 
Dalles City Council representing the Cities of 
Wasco County and served on the Mid-Colum-
bia Economic Development District Board, the 
Mt. Hood Economic Alliance Board, and as 
Vice-President of the QualityLife Intergovern-
mental Agency (QLife) Board. Additionally, 
through a CGCC subcontract with Wasco 
County, Dan served as the Wasco County 
Economic Development Coordinator where he 
crafted Wasco County’s comprehensive eco-
nomic development strategic plan and led the 
Wasco 2000 initiative to develop wastewater 
treatment in rural Wamic, Oregon. 
It’s hard to look around The Dalles without 
spotting something that hasn’t been touched 
by Dan’s efforts. The community and region 
are better off because of the time and energy 
he has invested in helping spur growth and 
development in the Gorge. Madam Speaker, I 
ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
Dan’s service, leadership, and dedication to 
the communities of Wasco County and The 
Dalles.

John’s passion for service began even be-
fore he championed community service and 
empowerment in the community. It was during 
his college years as an ethnic-studies student 
at University of California, Riverside that John 
started learning about and developing his Fili-
pino-American identity, eventually starting the 
Asian American fraternity Psi Chi Omega and 
continuing to serve in community organiza-
tions throughout college. Upon graduating, he 
served his country as part of the U.S. Marine 
Corps Reserves, receiving a National Defense 
Service Medal, a Good Conduct Medal, and a 
Rifle Expert Marksman badge during his six 
years with the Marine Corps. John then spent 
the rest of his career and life dedicated to ad-
vocacy and service. 
John had only recently been appointed as 
the Executive Director of Search to Involve 
Pilipino Americans (SIPA), an organization in 
my district that seeks to enrich and empower 
Filipino Americans by providing important 
health and human services, community eco-
nomic development, and cultural enrichment. 
Previously, he led SIPA’s small business 
counseling services and entrepreneurship pro-
gram as a staff member. Even before his term 
as Executive Director began, John was out 
there on the frontlines. When the COVID–19 
pandemic hit, he delivered food to seniors and 
underserved families and led wellness and 
cultural webinars. John even secured critical 
funding to support SIPA’s outreach programs 
and was later honored by the state legislature 
as one of the ‘‘Unsung Heroes of Southern 
California.’’ 
What stands out to all those who worked 
with John over the years is his work ethic, his 
selflessness, and his unwavering commitment 
to serving all communities, regardless of peo-
ple’s race, ethnicity or background. 
John’s lifetime of dedication and service will 
be remembered and greatly missed by all 
whom he encountered and all those who were 
impacted by his tremendous work. May it bring 
comfort to his family, friends, and loved ones 
that so many are celebrating the life John led 
and praying for them at this time.

RECOGNIZING THE UKRAINIAN 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF CHICAGO 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Ukrainian National Museum 
of Chicago (UNM), a cultural landmark in the 
heart of my district, on the occasion of its an-
nual banquet. The UNM prides itself, for good 
reason, on its museum artifacts, library, and 
archives, which highlight Ukraine’s history, its 
ongoing fight for freedom and democracy, and 
the rich culture and contributions made by 
Ukrainian 
Americans 
and 
Americans 
of 
Ukrainian heritage, both to Chicago’s cultural 
tapestry and to that of the United States. 
Each one of the four waves of immigration 
from Ukraine, as well as the generations of 
American Ukrainians who have followed, have 
brought with it a wealth of literary, music, artis-
tic, 
and 
cultural 
artifacts, 
historical 
testimonials, relics, scientific patents, personal 
keepsakes and reminders, all of which speak 
to the importance of Ukrainian heritage and 
the personal and professional accomplish-
ments of American Ukrainians across our 
country. 
Themselves a part of the third wave of 
Ukrainian immigrants to the United States, 
Olexa Hankewych, Julian Kamenetsky and 
Orest Horodysky, founded the Ukrainian Li-
brary and Archival Center in 1952 in order to 
preserve books and other documents at risk of 
destruction in Ukraine. Shortly after the estab-
lishment of the Library and Archival Center, a 
call went out to the Ukrainian community, 
which 
enthusiastically 
responded. 
Several 
years later the Library and Archival Center 
grew into the Ukrainian National Museum of 
Chicago, fully funded by community donations. 
While some artifacts in the Museum’s bur-
geoning collection were purchased in Ukraine, 
others were donated by Ukrainian American 
collectors and artists, as well as from personal 
libraries and individuals throughout the com-
munity, in Chicago and beyond. Over 100,000 
Ukrainian Americans live in Chicago, and I am 
proud that the Museum has its roots in our 
great city. 
The Ukrainian National Museum of Chicago 
too has much to be proud of, due to the hard 
work of its staff, board of directors, and offi-
cers. Unfortunately, only two of its past presi-
dents remain with us—Dr. George Hrycelak 
and Jaroslaw Hankewych, son of the Muse-
um’s founder, Olexa Hankewych. Today, 
under the leadership of Lydia Tkaczuk, the 
Museum’s first female president, the UNM 
continues its work in one of Chicago’s most 
historic 
neighborhoods, 
Ukrainian 
Village. 
More than just engaging visitors and adding to 
their understanding of Chicago’s rich and di-
verse communities, it also serves as a window 
to Ukraine, its history, and its people. 
The Museum’s diverse collection of folk-art, 
fine art, tapestry, traditional dress and artifacts 
help to illuminate the societal impact American 
Ukrainians have had on Chicago and across 
the United States. Its permanent exhibitions 
educate visitors on the history, heritage, poli-
tics, culture and religions of Ukraine and the 
broader Ukrainian American community, in-
cluding 
exhibits 
on 
the 
Kozak 
period, 
Ukraine’s role in the World Wars and impor-
tantly, the Holodomor, the forced famine-geno-
cide of nearly 4 million Ukrainians by Stalin 
across 1932 and 1933. 
Madam Speaker, the Ukrainian National Mu-
seum is a place where visitors feel welcomed 
and engaged. It serves as a pillar of knowl-
edge and culture for the Ukrainian community, 
for individuals of every background who call 
our city home, and for all the universities and 
students, artists, and authors throughout the 
world who have benefited from work in its ar-
chives. The City of Chicago is lucky to house 
such an institution, and it is my privilege today 
to recognize the Ukrainian National Museum 
here in Congress.

HONORING THE LIFE OF REGGIE 
ROBINSON 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and celebrate the life of 
Reggie Robinson, who passed away last 
week. Reggie was a fixture at the University of 
Kansas and inspired countless Jayhawks dur-
ing his time there. He is survived by his wife 
and their two daughters. 
Reggie attended KU both as an under-
graduate and law student. While there, he 
served as the student body vice president and 
went on to work as editor in chief of the Kan-
sas Law Review. But his dedication to KU did 
not stop after earning these degrees. 
Reggie devoted nearly 40 years of his life to 
KU and held numerous leadership roles. He 
was vice chancellor for public affairs at KU, di-
rector of KU’s School of Public Affairs and Ad-
ministration, president and CEO of the Kansas 
Board of Regents, a faculty member at the 
Washburn and KU schools of law, and chief of 
staff to Chancellor Robert Hemenway. Most 
recently, Reggie served as CEO of the Kan-
sas Health Foundation, a position he deeply 
loved. 
Another way that Reggie gave back to the 
community was through service on several 
leadership boards, including for the Friends of 
the Spencer Museum of Art, Hall Center for 
the Humanities, Kansas Leadership Center, 
Douglas County Community Foundation, and 
Bert Nash Community Mental Health Center. 
He also was a life trustee of KU Endowment 
and held advisory roles with the KU Alumni 
Association. 
On a personal note, I had the opportunity to 
meet Reggie several times and I always found 
him to be incredibly passionate about his job 
and ready to represent the best interests of 
his students. Though we didn’t serve at the 
same time, Reggie and I were also both White 
House fellows. Reggie spent five years in 
Washington, D.C., including the time he 
served as a White House fellow assigned to 
the office of then-Attorney General Janet 
Reno. 
Madam Speaker, I offer my sincere and 
deepest condolences to Reggie’s family, 
friends, and all those who benefitted from his 
kindness and mentorship. Reggie inspired 
many who walked the halls of KU and he will 
be dearly missed.

THE IMPROVING CYBERSECURITY 
OF SMALL ORGANIZATIONS ACT 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I’m proud to 
introduce H.R. 8379, the Improving Cyberse-
curity of Small Organizations Act, a bipartisan 
and bicameral bill to help small businesses, 
nonprofits, and local governments implement 
strong protections against cyberattacks. 
Many small businesses, small nonprofits, 
and small local governments can’t afford to 
hire cybersecurity professionals, yet they are 
still 
vulnerable 
to 
highly 
damaging 
cyberattacks. 
Ransomware 
attacks 
have 
caused critical government functions to be-
come inoperable. Data breaches have harmed 
employees and customers of businesses. De-
vices managed by organizations have been 
turned into botnets used to attack other orga-
nizations.

Small Organizations Act simply requires fed-

organizations can adopt to improve their cy-
bersecurity and protect everyone they serve. 
Specifically, H.R. 8379 directs the Cybersecu-
rity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) 
to issue guidance that documents and pro-
motes evidence-based cybersecurity policies 
and controls for small organizations (i.e., small 
businesses, nonprofits, and local govern-
ments); requires CISA, the Small Business 
Administration (SBA), and the Minority Busi-
ness Development Agency to promote the cy-
bersecurity guidance; requires the Secretary of 
Commerce to submit to Congress a report de-
scribing methods to incent small organizations 
to improve their cybersecurity; and requires 
the SBA to report on the state of small busi-
ness cybersecurity every two years. 
I thank Congressman JOHN KATKO, Senator 
JACKY ROSEN, and Senator JOHN CORNYN for 
partnering with me to introduce this bipartisan, 
bicameral bill, and I urge the House to take up 
this legislation in a timely fashion and ask my 
colleagues to support it.

HONORING DR. MONIQUE BUTLER, 
CHIEF 
MEDICAL 
OFFICER 
OF 
SWEDISH MEDICAL CENTER 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
today to recognize the accomplishments of Dr. 
Monique Butler who will be honored by The 
Chamber of Northwest Douglas County as a 
‘‘Woman Who Soars.’’ 
Dr. Butler has been the Chief Medical Offi-
cer for Swedish Medical Center since 2018 
and her career is an inspiration to all aspiring 
female doctors. A board-certified internist, Dr. 
Butler graduated from the University of Michi-
gan, Ann Arbor, and received her medical 
training at Wayne State University School of 
Medicine. 
Dr. Butler also completed a Master of Busi-
ness Administration from the University of 
Tennessee Physician Executive MBA program 
and holds a clinical assistant professorship at 
Michigan State University’s College of Osteo-
pathic Medicine. 
Prior to joining Swedish Medical Center, Dr. 
Butler came from the Children’s Hospital of 
Michigan—Detroit Medical Center, where she 
was the Chief Operating Officer. Previously 
she held positions as the Chief Medical Officer 
at Detroit Receiving Hospital and Sinai-Grace 
Hospital. 
Dr. Butler was voted A Woman of Excel-
lence in STEM careers in Michigan, was rec-
ognized as one of the Michigan Chronicle’s 40 
under 40, and most recently was identified in 
Becker’s Hospital Review as one of the 50 
great African American leaders in healthcare 
to know in the nation. She is the co-founder of 
the Young Doctors of Detroit program and 
founder of The Women Physicians Network. 
A dedicated leader who brings an excep-
tional background, knowledge, expertise, and 
record of success to our community, there are 
few others deserving of such an honor. I con-
gratulate Dr. Butler for receiving recognition as 
a ‘‘Woman Who Soars.’’

SALUTING 
AMERICAN 
PATRIOTS 
OF WWII FOR SERVICE WITH THE 
CANADIAN AND BRITISH ARMED 
FORCES 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
formally honor the legacy of the Ohioans and 
all other Americans who volunteered to defend 
democracy, our nation, and our allies during 
the Second World War. These individuals 
joined the military by the thousands prior to 
the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, 
Hawaii. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
encouraged the volunteerism through words 
and initiatives, and Hollywood supported these 
efforts in feature films. 
Notably, the responding patriots proactively 
fought the forces of Nazism and fascism be-
fore the U.S. was officially a combatant, which 
helped provide time for the United States to 
prepare. The practical skills and knowledge 
obtained through Canadian and British training 
and operations proved invaluable once our na-
tion officially took up arms in Europe and Asia. 
The intrepid volunteers from the State of 
Ohio included Edward Tracey of Cortland, 
Donald James Matthew ‘‘Don’’ Blakeslee of 
Fairport Harbor, and Dominic Salvatore ‘‘Don’’ 
Gentile of Piqua. Gentile has been often re-
ferred to as a ‘‘One Man Air Force’’ and the 
‘‘Ace of Aces.’’ I would be remiss if I did not 
mention Frank Zavakos of Dayton, who was a 
member of the famous No. 71 (Eagle) Squad-
ron of the Royal Air Force, a unit largely com-
prised of American pilots, who gave his life. 
Madam Speaker, those American women 
who served in the British Air Transport Auxil-
iary are also deserving of recognition. Among 
this group was Bessie Lee Pittman, more 
commonly known as Jacqueline ‘‘Jackie’’ 
Cochran. Cochran was a pioneer of women’s 
aviation and the first woman to fly a bomber 
across the Atlantic. She was the wartime lead-
er of the Women Airforce Service Pilots and in 
the postwar era the first female to make a su-
personic flight. Another was Helen Richey, 
who in 1934 won the premier air race in Day-
ton, Ohio, during the first National Air Meet for 
women. Richey was the first female pilot to be 
hired by a commercial airline in the United 
States. Ann Wood-Kelly was also an ATA 
standout, receiving the King’s Medal for Serv-
ice in the Cause of Freedom and eventually 
becoming an assistant to the U.S. air attache´ 
in London, a public relations manager for 
Northeast Airlines, and the first female vice- 
president of Pan American Airways. 
There are certainly more heroes to note. 
Kermit Roosevelt, the son of President Theo-
dore Roosevelt, Jr., secured a commission in 
the British Army. John Gillespie Magee, Jr., 
enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and 
subsequently composed the immortal sonnet 
High Flight. William Meade Lindsley ‘‘Billy’’ 
Fiske III, who was the youngest gold medalist 
in any winter sport until 1992, died as a Royal 
Air Force aviator. Joseph Charles ‘‘Big Joe’’ 
McCarthy of the Royal Canadian Air Force 
flew on Operation Chastise, the famous Dams 
Raid. William Robert ‘‘Poppy’’ Dunn, either the 
first or second American ace of the conflict, 
served in the Canadian Army and Royal Air 
Force. William J. Vanderkloot, Jr., Prime Min-
ister Winston Churchill’s personal pilot, flew for 
the Royal Air Force Ferry Command. Chesley 
Gordon ‘‘Pete’’ Peterson earned a Distin-
guished Flying Cross while flying with the 
Royal Air Force. Last but not least was the in-
spirational Vernon Charles ‘‘Shorty’’ Keough, 
who flew many missions during the Battle of 
Britain. Keough was the most diminutive avi-
ator in the Royal Air Force; yet his legacy is 
lofty in the annals of history. 
This year, 2020, marks the 75th anniversary 
of the formal ending of World War II. The 
bravery and foresight displayed by the volun-
teers from my state and the rest of the United 
States represent a largely unrecognized story 
of valor. Therefore, I ask you and my other 
distinguished colleagues to join me in saluting 
them.

EXPANDING ACCESS TO SUSTAIN-
ABLE ENERGY ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 23, 2020 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 4447, the Clean Econ-
omy Jobs and Innovation Act. 
As we know from the devastating wildfires in 
my state, the reality of the climate crisis is 
here. The planet we are leaving to our chil-
dren is different from the one we were born 
on, and we have to reverse course now before 
it is too late. 
I want to thank my colleagues who offered 
amendments to make this an even stronger 
green bill. In particular, I thank my friend Rep-
resentative BARRAGA´N for offering an amend-
ment I co-sponsored to invest in helping sea-
ports to make their operations more efficient 
and less polluting. And I thank the environ-
mental groups who gave critical input on this 
legislation and on the urgent need for our 
country and for the world to close the chapter 
on the era of fossil fuels. 
During this year’s unprecedented wildfires, 
smoke has been at unhealthy and even haz-
ardous levels for weeks on end in my district. 
Wildfire smoke is especially damaging to vul-
nerable populations, for example unsheltered 
people. H.R. 4447 includes the Smoke Plan-
ning and Research Act to help state and local 
governments protect their communities from 
wildfire smoke. I believe we have a critical 
need for this legislation to respond to a seri-
ous threat to public health—for example by 
creating shelters for at-risk populations or ret-
rofitting schools with air filters so students can 
safely attend school.

September 29, 2020 
H.R. 4447 also includes the Climate Smart 
Ports Act, which will help us address health 
disparities and other issues in communities 
near ports, which have often suffered from 
generations of environmental injustice. The 
legislation includes a $1 billion per year zero 
emissions ports infrastructure program to as-
sist ports and port users with replacing cargo 
handling equipment, port harbor craft, drayage 
trucks, and other equipment with zero emis-
sions equipment and technology. In West 
Oakland, the neighborhood bordering the Port 
of Oakland, the asthma hospitalization rate for 
children under the age of 5 is almost twice the 
rate for Alameda County as a whole. We must 
take action to reduce the massive amounts of 
fossil fuels burned by ports—both to address 
the climate crisis and to help our kids breathe. 
I have heard the concerns expressed about 
some key provisions of this bill, and those 
concerns are valid. I do not support funding 
for projects that could result in further use of 
dirty or dangerous energy sources. I hope that 
we can work to improve this bill as it moves 
through the legislative process. 
Nonetheless, much of the content of this bill 
would make necessary steps toward the clean 
energy revolution that we are all working for. 
It encourages the innovation that we need to 
address the fossil fuel-driven climate emer-
gency while investing in renewable energy re-
sources, electrification of transportation, reduc-
tion of carbon pollution from industrial and 
other sources, modernization of the grid and 
much more. 
For these reasons, I support H.R. 4447 as 
a significant step away from fossil fuels and 
towards innovation and cleaner energy.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
GEORGIA DOBBINS DAVIS 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
tribute to Georgia Dobbins Davis, a long-time 
resident of the 13th Congressional District’s 
Inkster, Michigan and Former Motown artist, 
who passed away on September 18, 2020. 
Born in Arkansas, Ms. Dobbins moved to 
Michigan at a young age. She spent her teen-
age years in Inkster, singing and performing 
with several local musical groups, including 
the Marvels, the group with which Georgia 
Dobbins made her mark on Motown. The Mar-
vels nearly missed the chance to audition for 
Motown when they came in fourth place of 
their high school talent show. In the end, they 
ended up tagging along with the winning 
group. Motown executives were so impressed 
by the group’s performance, they asked the 
young women to come up with an original 
song. Ms. Dobbins worked with a friend who 
wrote the melody for the song ‘‘Please Mr. 
Postman’’ while she wrote the lyrics in only 
three days’ time. ‘‘Please Mr. Postman’’ was 
the hit song that launched a career for the 
Marvels, now known as the Marvelettes. 
While Ms. Dobbins ultimately did not pursue 
a musical career, her song was a significant 
contribution to music and Detroit’s culture and 
sound. It reached number one on the charts 
after only fourteen weeks and has been cov-
ered by artists such as the Carpenters who 
had their own hit with it, and the Beatles. 
Ms. Dobbins remained in Inkster, raising her 
daughter, Kimberly and working at a local gro-
cery store. She was well known for her beau-
tiful smile and kind heart. Please join me in 
honoring the memory of Ms. Georgia Dobbins 
Davis.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BOBBY 
LEE VERDUGO 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Bobby Lee 
Verdugo, a Chicano activist from East Los An-
geles, most known as the leader of the 1968 
East Los Angeles high school walkouts. 
Growing up in the Lincoln Heights neighbor-
hood of Los Angeles, Bobby lived the all- 
American life—he was a popular football play-
er, his father coached a youth baseball team, 
and his mother was part of the Parent Teach-
er Association and volunteered for Bobby’s 
Boy Scouts troop. Despite the active role Bob-
by’s family played in the community, he and 
his Latino classmates would get singled out 
for speaking Spanish in school and were sub-
jected to paddlings by their white teachers as 
punishment. The Latino students at the school 
were also being tracked into vocational class-
es. They were not afforded college pre-
paratory courses or resources, and made to 
feel as if their futures were all but bright. 
Eastside schools were notoriously rundown 
and overcrowded and had some of the worst 
dropout rates in the country. Encouraged by 
his social science teacher, Sal Castro, Bobby 
and other students across the Eastside of Los 
Angeles organized a walkout to protest the 
discrimination, abuse, and mistreatment. Soon 
thousands of Latino students across the coun-
try followed suit, bringing the attention of the 
entire nation to their cause. 
Bobby eventually enrolled at UCLA but left 
after two years to work as a bus dispatcher 
and a labor organizer. He married Yolando 
Rios, his high school sweetheart and fellow 
walkouts organizer, and they had two kids. 
After noticing the lack of resources for at- 
risk young men, particularly Latino youth, 
Bobby decided to enroll at California State 
University of Los Angeles at the age of 40 to 
become a social worker. In 1995, he co-found-
ed Con Los Padres, a counseling program 
modeled after the Mesoamerican talking cir-
cles (cı´rculos), giving teenage fathers the 
space to discuss their feelings, connect to 
their heritage, and receive the support they 
needed to navigate fatherhood. 
His advocacy work led him to speaking invi-
tations across the country and Bobby quickly 
became a frequent figure at Latino high school

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
POLYCYSTIC 
OVARY 
SYN-
DROME (PCOS) 
HON. DAVID SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the serious-
ness of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). 
PCOS is a genetic, hormone, metabolic and 
reproductive disorder that affects women and 
girls. PCOS can lead to lifelong complications 
such as infertility; anxiety, depression and 
other psychosocial disorders; obesity; severe 
hair and skin issues; endometrial cancer; type 
2 diabetes; cardiovascular disease; non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease and other life- 
threatening conditions. Many of these com-
plications are a significant burden on quality of 
life, health, and the healthcare system. 
PCOS affects over 10 million women and 
girls in the United States. Currently, there is 
no cure for PCOS, and women living with this 
disorder experience symptoms such as insulin 
resistance, menstrual irregularities, weight 
gain, thinning scalp hair, and depression and 
anxiety during puberty and throughout their 
lives. PCOS is a grave issue that affects hun-
dreds of thousands of women in Georgia and 
millions more across the country. For far too 
long, PCOS has been a prevalent public 
health concern, threatening the mental and 
physical health and quality of life of girls, 
women and their families. 
Increasing 
awareness 
about 
polycystic 
ovary syndrome is critical to our efforts to ad-
dress the national maternal mortality crisis and 
prevent pregnancy-related deaths. Pregnant 
women with polycystic ovary syndrome are 
more likely to develop gestational diabetes, 
preeclampsia 
(pregnancy-related 
hyper-
tension) and have emergency C-sections. 
Without access to quality prenatal care, many 
African American women with PCOS are not 
diagnosed until they have difficulty getting 
pregnant or experience dangerous pregnancy 
complications. PCOS is also the most com-
mon cause of female infertility. Many women 
living with the disorder often have mis-
carriages or premature deliveries. 
There is a growing need to educate 
healthcare providers about PCOS because 
50–70 percent of PCOS patients are going 
undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. According to 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, about 50 percent of women with PCOS 
develop Type 2 Diabetes or prediabetes by 
the age of 40 and are at high risk for cardio-
vascular disease. Women and girls with this 
disorder are also at higher risk for uterine can-
cer, liver disease, and suicide. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me to 
advance this bipartisan effort and make PCOS 
a public health priority.

trict to celebrate the unveiling of the Advanced 
Manufacturing Collaborative to be located at 
the University of South Carolina Aiken, as well

OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, l rise today 
to recognize the service of Robert S. Crouch 
of Willisburg, Kentucky. 
Following the attacks on our nation in Pearl 
Harbor, Bob answered the call to serve and 
arrived at his local recruiting depot on Decem-
ber 8, 1941, with the intention of signing up for 
the U.S. Army, though he saw the Marines in 
their dress blue uniforms and decided to sign 
up for the Marines instead. Bob was eventu-
ally deployed to the Pacific theatre. He earned 
a Purple Heart for his valiant efforts in the Bat-
tle of Iwo Jima. He was also awarded a Presi-
dential Unit Citation, Campaign Ribbons, the 
WWII Victory Medal, and the Combat Action 
Ribbon. He retired from the Marine Corps as 
a Master Gunner Sergeant in 1984. In addition 
to his service in the Marines, Bob has served 
as a volunteer firefighter and serves as a dea-
con at his church. 
I want to thank Bob for his service to our 
great Nation.

HONORING ZOE¨ ROYER 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
today to recognize the accomplishments of 
Ms. Zoe¨ yer who will be honored by The 
Chamber of Northwest Douglas County as a 
‘‘Woman Who Soars.’’ 
Zoe¨’s story is heartbreaking and inspiring. 
When she was 14, her mother was killed by 
her father who then took his own life. She and 
her younger sister were suddenly homeless 
and entered the foster care system. Zoe¨ was 
placed in more than a dozen homes in her 
teens and dropped out of high school. 
Through the help of a local non-profit, she was 
given hope and a future. She is a recent grad-
uate of Metropolitan State University and now 
works to pay it forward. 
Zoe¨ has become a mental health advocate, 
a writer and activist. Zoe¨ believes in fighting 
for a better and more equitable world through 
building relationships with her community. She 
is passionate about social change and hopes 
to inspire and empower others by telling her 
story. 
Zoe¨
has 
supported 
suicide 
prevention 
projects, charities assisting homeless students 
in education, and feminist non-profits through-
out the state of Colorado. Zoe¨ has been the 
president of several student organizations, in-
cluding a women’s social justice honor society. 
She now holds a psychological sciences de-
gree from Metropolitan State University of 
Denver and is looking forward to attending a 
Ph.D. program. 
As a recent graduate, advocate, and a sur-
vivor of incredible adversity, she truly is de-
serving of such an honor. I congratulate Ms. 
Royer for being recognized as a ‘‘Woman 
Who Soars.’’

HONORING PETER BLACKSTOCK 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the career achievements and 
community dedication of Peter Blackstock, a 
prominent businessman, community steward, 
and philanthropist who has called the central 
coast of California his home for nearly 40 
years. 
Peter Blackstock was born on the East 
Coast and served in the Army as an officer in 
Vietnam before working for the Ford Motor 
Company. In 1982, Peter moved to the Cen-
tral Coast and purchased the Leslie Motors 
Toyota dealership in Seaside and renamed it 
Victory Toyota. Later, he opened Lexus Mon-
terey Peninsula, forming Victory Dealership 
Group. 
During his time as owner of Victory Dealer-
ship Group, Peter was a significant supporter 
of the automobile dealer community. He advo-
cated for and actively contributed to industry 
priorities as a member of the American Inter-
national Automobile Dealers Association’s 
board of directors, President of the California 
New Car Dealers Association, and a director 
on the board of the National Automobile Deal-
ers Association. He also set the bar for dealer-
ships across the country when Victory Toyota 
was LEED certified for environmental respon-
sibility in 2014. As a businessman, Peter is 
held in high esteem by all he worked with for 
his personal integrity, thoughtful contributions, 
professional demeanor, and engaging person-
ality. 
Peter is an especially involved member of 
his community on the Central Coast. He has 
secured resources for and served in many 
roles in countless organizations, including the 
Monterey Peninsula Chamber of Commerce, 
Boy Scouts, Monterey Bay Symphony, Mon-
terey Museum of Art, Make a Wish Founda-
tion, AIM Youth Mental Health, Pac Rep The-
atre Groups, SPCA, AT&T Junior Golf, Church

in the Forest, Hospice Giving, Arthritis Foun-
dation, National WWII Museum, Marine Schol-
arship Foundation, Meals on Wheels, and 
Rancho Cielo. Most notably, he is Director 
Emeritus of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Mon-
terey County, a past President of the Ventana 
Wilderness Alliance instrumental in protections 
for the California Condor, falcons, and other 
raptors, trustee emeritus of the Naval Post-
graduate School Foundation, and was Vice- 
Chairman of the Economic Development Com-
mittee of the Fort Ord Reuse Committee. He 
has also served on the Monterey County 
Sheriffs Advisory Council, the task forces of 
the City of Seaside, the boards of All Saints 
and Stevenson Schools, and as foreman pro 
tempore on the Monterey County Civil Grand 
Jury. 
As he begins his retirement, I have no doubt 
that Peter will continue to find myriad ways to 
support his community and cherish his time 
with his beloved wife, Barbara, and his daugh-
ter, son-in-law, and three grandchildren, who 
are triplets. We, as a community, are grateful 
for his contributions to the Central Coast and 
celebrate his successful career.

IN 
HONOR 
OF 
THE 
EXTRAOR-
DINARY LIFE AND LEGACY OF 
REVEREND ROBERT S. GRAETZ, 
JR. 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Reverend Robert S. 
Graetz Jr., a Lutheran minister and heroic Civil 
Rights Activist who passed away at the age of 
92. In 1955, as a white minister Rev. Graetz 
alongside his wife Mrs. Jeannie Graetz came 
to Montgomery, Alabama to serve the all black 
congregation of Trinity Lutheran Church. Dem-
onstrating tremendous courage, Rev. Graetz 
played a critical role in the Montgomery Bus 
Boycott by personally sacrificing his time and 
resources in the fight for equal rights. 
Born on May 16, 1928 in Clarksburg, West 
Virginia, Rev. Graetz studied Theology at Cap-
ital University in Ohio, where he became inter-
ested in civil rights through his studies, found-
ing a campus group to discuss race relations. 
After graduating in 1950, he attended Trinity 
Lutheran Seminary in Columbus, Ohio where 
he founded the Columbus N.A.A.C.P. chapter. 
In 1951, Rev. Graetz and Jeannie Ellis were 
married in East Springfield, Pennsylvania and 
together they had seven children. 
Shortly after his arrival in Montgomery, Rev. 
Graetz became acquainted with the local 
N.A.A.C.P. youth council director Rosa Parks 
who held weekly meetings in the church 
pastored by Rev. Graetz. Rev. Graetz became 
active in the protest upon learning of the ar-
rest of Rosa Parks. At his next Sunday serv-
ice, he urged his parishioners to participate in 
the Bus Boycott and offered them a ride to 
work. 
What originally began as a single day on 
December 5, 1955 turned into over a year of 
boycotting that ended on December 20, 1956. 
Rev. Graetz spent three hours every morning 
driving black members of the community to 
work. With his increasing involvement, he be-
came an instrumental part of the success of 
the Montgomery Bus Boycott. 
Rev. Graetz became the Secretary of the 
Montgomery Improvement Association, where 
he worked closely with Rosa Parks and avidly 
supported Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Rev. 
Graetz was the only white minister to publicly 
support the efforts of the Montgomery Bus 
Boycott, making him and his family a target of 
the Ku Klux Klan. There were several threats 
and attempts on Rev. Graetz and his family’s 
lives—including two firebombs that damaged 
their home but thankfully harmed no one. Not 
to be deterred, Rev. Graetz loudly and proudly 
continued to fight for what he believed was the 
work of God in securing and defending the 
equal rights of his black church members. In 
support of Rosa Parks, he attended her court 
hearing and even attempted to sit in the col-
ored section in the courtroom. Later, when the 
FBI urged Rev. Graetz and his family to leave 
Montgomery for their safety, they refused and 
remained unwavering in their public support of 
the Civil Rights Movement. 
After the end of the Montgomery Bus Boy-
cott, Rev. Graetz and his wife Jeannie left 
Montgomery and returned to Columbus, Ohio 
in 1958 where Rev. Graetz served another 
predominantly black congregation. In the fol-
lowing years, he and his wife traveled across 
the nation to advocate for civil rights—eventu-
ally spending 13 years in Washington, D.C. as 
a lobbyist for marginalized individuals. 
Throughout his life, Rev. Graetz authored 
several publications including: A Congrega-
tional Guide to Human Relations; An Informed 
Church Serves a Diverse Society; Mont-
gomery—a White Preacher’s Memoir; and A 
White Preachers Message on Race and Rec-
onciliation—Based on His Experiences Begin-
ning with the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rev. 
Graetz also received the following honors: 
Russwurm Award, National Negro Newspaper 
Publishers Association; Selma Humanitarian 
Award; Distinguished Alumnus, Trinity Lu-
theran Seminary; Doctor of Humanities, Cap-
ital University; Ohio Humanitarian Award; Ohio 
Governor’s Humanitarian Award. After return-
ing to Montgomery in 2007, Rev. Graetz and 
his wife dedicated their service to Alabama 
State University and hosted the annual Graetz 
Symposium at the National Center for the 
Study of Civil Rights and African-American 
Culture at Alabama State University. 
On a personal note, I have tremendous re-
spect and admiration for the significant con-
tributions that Rev. and Mrs. Graetz made to 
fight for civil rights and racial equality in the 
Montgomery community. Grounded by his faith 
and genuine belief in the value of all God’s 
children, Rev. Graetz led by example in sup-
porting the Montgomery Bus Boycott. It was 
the boycott of public transit in Montgomery for 
381 days that resulted in the end of racial seg-
regation in commerce across this nation. We 
owe a debt of gratitude to the personal sac-
rifice and threats to their lives that Rev. and 
Mrs. Graetz must have endured in the quest 
for equality and justice for all. To say thank 
you doesn’t seem enough. May we rededicate 
ourselves to the cause of racial equality and 
reconciliation that exemplified the life’s work of 
Reverend Graetz. And may the Lord say—well 
done thy good and faithful servant, Well Done. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the extraordinary life and legacy of 
Reverend Robert S. Graetz, Jr., and his in-
credible contributions to the Civil Rights Move-
ment.

REMEMBERING ERVIN JULIAN 
HON. DEBBIE LESKO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 29, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of Ervin Julian from Sur-
prise, Arizona. Mr. Julian was one of the few 
World War II veterans still alive in Arizona, a 
centenarian, a Valley resident for more than 
50 years, and a proud husband and father. 
Mr. Julian was born in Waltham, Massachu-
setts and enlisted in the United States Navy 
for four years during World War II. During his 
time in service, he was stationed at Naval Air 
Station Corpus Christi, Texas, where he 
worked as the base commander’s assistant. 
Shortly after his service, he moved to Phoenix, 
Arizona where he worked as a wholesale 
salesman. 
He was married to the love of his life, Lou-
ise Julian, for nearly seventy-two years. To-
gether, they raised their son Steven, who 
often refers to his dad as ‘‘a great hero.’’ His 
only grandson, Joseph Charles Bentley Julian, 
is proud of his grandfather’s service and the 
contributions he made to our nation. 
Mr. Julian was a member of the American 
Legion and a big supporter of Boy Scouts of 
America. He fueled his love of antique auto-
mobiles by being active in the Horseless Car-
riage Club of America and Wally Byam Cara-
van Club International. 
His family continues to cherish one of the 
most memorable final moments they shared 
together—when he went viral at a rally for 
President Donald Trump in February 2020. Mr. 
Julian captured the hearts of many when two 
men carried him down a flight of stairs at the 
Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum as the 
crowd chanted ‘‘U-S-A! U-S-A!’’ in the back-
ground. 
On this day, we as a community would like 
to thank Mr. Julian for his service to our coun-
try and ask those who knew him to pray for 
his family during this time of mourning.

church leader, family leader, community leader 
and all around wonderful human being. 
Mr. Walker Harris started work in the ice 
business when he was eighteen years old 
while visiting with his sister and her husband 
while deciding what to do after high school. 
He had grown up in Louisiana and after 
school worked for a black owned business 
helping out; therefore, he knew that he wanted 
to be a businessman. 
While 18 he was hired as an ice bagger, he 
quickly learned the business and its distribu-
tion process. After a few months he heard that 
one of the drivers was retiring and wanted to 
sell his route of thirty clients. Mr. Walker Har-
ris purchased the client list, started his own 
company and was off and running. After a few 
years he heard that a distribution warehouse 
was available for sale, he purchased the ware-
house, upgraded the building and hired driv-
ers. His business acumen, delivery, and cus-
tomer service were so effective that he be-
came one of the top ice distributors in the city 
of Chicago. In the meantime, he was actively 
engaged with his church, became a developer 
of some affordable housing units and became 
known as a leader in the community. He has 
been acknowledged by several church, civic, 
business, and community groups for out-
standing service and contributions to his com-
munity and the city of Chicago. 
I now commend and congratulate Mr. Walk-
er Harris for outstanding service to humanity 
as we celebrate his birthday and the great 
contributions made through his ownership and 
development of the Walker Harris Ice Com-
pany.
