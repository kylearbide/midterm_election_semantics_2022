HONORING 
PROSPER, 
TEXAS, 
TOWN MANAGER HARLAN JEF-
FERSON 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Harlan Jefferson, the 
Town Manager for Prosper, Texas, for his 
over 30 years of dedicated public service to 
our rapidly growing region. 
Mr. Jefferson earned his bachelor of arts in 
political science and master of administration 
from the University of North Texas (UNT). For 
his outstanding efforts, he was recognized as 
a 2003 Distinguished Alumni for the Depart-
ment of Public Administration with UNT. 
Prior to beginning his career with the Town 
of Prosper, Harlan was previously employed 
for 15 years in Flower Mound, serving in the 
roles of Town Manager, Deputy Town Man-
ager/Chief Financial Officer, and Director of Fi-
nance, Mr. Jefferson also previously held the 
position of Treasurer, Director of Treasury Op-
erations, and Risk Manager for the City of 
Denton. 
Mr. Jefferson has played an integral role in 
shepherding the Town of Prosper through a 
period of exponential growth, helping to bring 
valuable amenities to the area including great-
er retail, commercial, and healthcare options. 
Additionally, his initiatives to improve the qual-
ity of life for Prosper residents resulted in the 
addition and expansion of parks and trail sys-
tems, a community activity center, and other 
outdoor recreation options. 
In order to meet the needs of this growing 
community, Mr. Jefferson helped secure need-
ed funds from the Regional Transportation 
Council to improve and expand roadway and 
infrastructure. Further, his commitment to pub-
lic safety has been evident through his guid-
ance in the construction of multiple public 
safety stations and the creation of Crime Con-
trol and Fire Prevention Districts in Prosper. 
Harlan’s service to the community includes 
past involvement as the Campaign Chairman 
of the Denton County United Way, the Texas 
City Management Association’s Board of Di-
rectors, Texas Municipal League Intergovern-
mental Risk Pool Board of Directors, the Pros-
per Chamber of Commerce, and as President- 
elect of the Prosper Rotary Club. 
Now as he begins a new chapter in his life 
working alongside his wife, I ask my col-
leagues in the United States House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in saluting Mr. Harlan 
Jefferson for his many efforts to build our re-
gion and wish him great success in his future 
endeavors. 
EDWARD TALBOT 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Edward Talbot 
of the United States Merchant Marine for his 
service to our country. 
Edward Talbot joined the U.S. Merchant 
Marine as a 20-year-old in 1968 during the 
Vietnam war. From 1968 to 1972, Edward 
served onboard various U.S. flagged deep 
water merchant ships throughout the Pacific, 
working on tankers, cargo ships, container 
ships, and passenger liners. During his time 
as a merchant mariner, he work on ships 
which included military cargo shipments des-
tined for ports throughout Vietnam. 
While serving as seaman on a passenger 
liner off the coast of New Zealand in 1969, 
Edward’s crew spotted and picked up a Ma¯ori 
fisherman who had been lost at sea for over 
24 days. Edward was part of the lifeboat crew 
which retrieved him. After his crew’s heroics 
made the front pages across New Zealand, 
Edward and his crewmembers were cele-
brated by grateful New Zealand citizens. 
For his service to the United States, Edward 
was awarded the Merchant Marine Vietnam 
Service Medal. After his time in the Merchant 
Marine, Edward came back to Colorado and 
served his community as a longtime employee 
for the City of Arvada. Most recently Edward 
served as the director of the Arvada Housing 
Authority and manager for the Housing Pres-
ervation and Resources Division, providing af-
fordable housing and community development 
programs for the community. Edward is now 
retired and lives in Arvada. 
Edward’s lifetime of public service to our 
country and community exemplifies the best of 
Colorado. I extend my deepest appreciation to 
Edward for his dedication, integrity, and out-
standing service to the Arvada community, the 
great State of Colorado, and the United States 
of America.

HONORING BRAD BOLTON OF RED 
BAY, ALABAMA 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to recognize and congratulate Mr. Brad 
Bolton, president, CEO, and senior lender for 
Community Spirit Bank in Red Bay, Alabama, 
on his recent election to become the chairman 
of the Independent Community Bankers of 
America. 
The Independent Community Bankers of 
America is the only national organization that 
exclusively represents community banks and 
their interests, and they create and promote 
environments where community banks flour-
ish. Community banks constitute 99 percent of 
all banks nationwide, employ more than 
700,000 Americans, and hold over $5 trillion in 
assets. 
Mr. Bolton is extremely qualified for his im-
portant role as chairman as he serves in mul-
tiple vital leadership roles at the Independent 
Community Bankers of America. He is cur-
rently chairman of the ICBA Executive Com-
mittee and Board of Directors, a mentor of 
ICBA’s Federal Delegate board and its Policy 
Development and Nominating committees, a 
member of ICBA’s ThinkTECH selection com-
mittee, and serves as the Executive Com-
mittee liaison to the Bank Services Committee. 
He has also previously served on the Board of 
Directors as chairman of the Bank Education 
Committee and several other committees. 
Mr. Bolton holds a Bachelor of Business Ad-
ministration from the University of West Ala-
bama in Livingston, Alabama, and he is a 
graduate of the Barret School of Banking in 
Memphis, Tennessee. 
As a second-generation community banker, 
Mr. Bolton is ardently active at the local level. 
His involvement includes, but is not limited to, 
serving on the Legislative Committee of the 
Mississippi Bankers Association, serving as an 
elected member of the Red Bay, Alabama, 
City Council and a member of the Franklin 
County Community Development Commission. 
He also previously served as past chairman of 
the Alabama Young Bankers, known as Lead-
ership Community Bankers, and on the Atlanta 
Federal Reserve Board’s Community Deposi-
tory Institution Advisory Council. 
Peers have described Mr. Bolton as some-
one who ‘‘works tirelessly for the betterment of 
our industry on the local, state and national 
level’’ and are ‘‘confident he will continue to 
make a difference in community banking as he 
moves to this next level of leadership with the 
ICBA.’’ 
Mr. Bolton is not just a banker in the Red 
Bay community, but also a leader in our state 
and region and, most importantly, a friend. He 
is married to his wife, Julie and they have 
three children, Brooklyn Bolton Yancey and 
her husband Lane Yancey; Bailey Bolton; and 
Brady Bolton. 
He understands the needs of his rural com-
munity and works avidly to fulfill them, so 
today I ask you to join me in congratulating 
him on his election and already life changing 
career and wishing him luck on his future en-
deavors as the chairman of the Independent 
Community Bankers of America.

Police Department. He is retiring after three 
decades of service to the community to be-
come a United States Marshal for New Hamp-
shire. Chief Hart served in the U.S. Marine 
Corps before joining the Londonderry commu-
nity in 1992. Throughout his distinguished ca-
reer, Chief Hart has served as Londonderry’s 
prosecutor, Rockingham County’s attorney, a 
Captain with the Londonderry Police Depart-
ment, acting town manager, and most recently 
as the Chief of Police since 2009. 
Chief Hart has dedicated his life to his com-
munity and guided the Londonderry Police De-
partment through tremendous growth. He led 
the department through a new station and 
building transition, and grew the department to 
68 sworn police officers. Bill exemplifies the 
department’s way of building trust: to treat 
people with kindness, dignity, and respect, no 
matter what. 
As Chief of Police Bill has continuously 
shown dedication to bettering the community 
and the Granite State. He has always gone 
above and beyond to ensure the safety of the 
people 
in 
Londonderry, and all Granite 
Staters. I have no doubt that his commitment 
and leadership will continue as he joins the 
oldest law enforcement agency. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate Chief Hart on his accomplished 
law enforcement career. I thank him and his 
family for their decades of dedication to our 
community and wish him all the best as he 
embarks on his new journey as a U.S. Mar-
shal.

25TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
EAGLE ROCK CONCERTS IN THE 
PARK 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of the 25th anniversary of the Eagle 
Rock Concerts in the Park summer music se-
ries. The Eagle Rock Concerts in the Park se-
ries was founded by Michael Nogueira in 1997 
and has grown to become an annual attraction 
that residents from Eagle Rock and neigh-
boring communities in Northeast Los Angeles 
look forward to each year. 
For the last 25 years, the Eagle Rock Con-
certs in the Park series has advanced commu-
nity cohesiveness in Northeast Los Angeles 
through the artistic musical mediums of per-
formance. 
The Eagle Rock Concerts in the Park series 
was especially critical in promoting a sense of 
comradery and community during the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
Today, I am proud to recognize Michael 
Nogueira, the Eagle Rock Chamber of Com-
merce, and Sir Michael’s Events for their tire-
less efforts in making this annual event an 
overwhelming success and for making North-
east Los Angeles and the Eagle Rock commu-
nity a better place to live. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring and celebrating the Eagle 
Rock Concerts in the Park summer music se-
ries on its 25th anniversary. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JERRY 
GLADBACH 
HON. MIKE GARCIA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Jerry Gladbach, 
an accomplished, distinguished, and beloved 
public servant to the City of Santa Clarita for 
more than three decades. Countless friends, 
colleagues, and family members remember 
Jerry for the way he treated everyone he en-
countered with kindness and respect. In addi-
tion to his affable demeanor and his magnetic 
personality, Jerry also left a remarkable impact 
on the world of Southern California water, 
using his unique set of skills and expertise to 
ensure Santa Clarita had access to clean 
water as it expanded from a small town to a 
booming suburb of Los Angeles. 
Jerry received his bachelor’s and master’s 
degrees from University of Missouri Columbia 
before moving to Santa Clarita in 1968. Upon 
arriving in California during one of the most 
dynamic periods of growth in the State’s his-
tory, Jerry went to work establishing his roots, 
raising a family, and throwing himself into his 
work to provide clean and accessible water to 
the citizens of Los Angeles County. During his 
35 years of service as an engineer at the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
Jerry was responsible for creating solutions to 
provide reliable and clean water to millions of 
people. 
In 1985, Jerry was first elected to the 
Castaic Lake Water Agency Board in 1985, a 
whole year before Santa Clarita was even in-
corporated as a city, serving on the board 
through its merger to become the Santa 
Clarita Valley Water Agency, until his passing. 
During his tenure, he oversaw the expansion 
of Santa Clarita from a city of 85,000 to a city 
of more than 400,000, ensuring access to safe 
and reliable water to all its residents along the 
way. Additionally, he took his breadth of 
knowledge to share with various organizations, 
including the Local Agency Formation Com-
mission, in which he served as president, 
chair, and received the ‘‘Most Outstanding 
Commissioner’’ Award in 2013. His dedication 
and willingness to encourage others left a sig-
nificant impact on those that worked for and 
around him. 
His lifetime of service has left an indelible 
mark on our community, and his work on 
Santa Clarita’s water boards will have a last-
ing impact for generations of Californians. His 
passion, kindness, and knowledge will un-
doubtedly inspire others to follow in his foot-
steps of dedicated public service. Our commu-
nity is blessed to have had a man like him 
serving as a proficient steward of our water re-
sources, and those who knew him are blessed 
to have counted him as a friend. We will con-
tinue to pray for his loving family that he left 
behind, but they can look back fondly at the 
legacy of Jerry knowing that he made a dif-
ference for the city he loved so much. 
ANTHONY IOZZO 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Anthony Iozzo 
of the United States Army for his service to 
our country. 
Anthony Iozzo was an officer in the U.S. 
Army from 1942 to 1944 during World War II. 
Anthony started his service at the United 
States Army Officer Candidate School in Fort 
Benning, Georgia, and successfully graduated 
in October 1942. He was then deployed to Eu-
rope on February 11, 1944, with the 119th In-
fantry. He was part of the second wave of the 
D-Day Invasion and fought heroically in the 
hedgerows of northern France. 
His only child, Anthony, was born on July 
10, 1944. Two days later, he was killed by a 
German sniper at Pont Hebert in northern 
France as his unit was approaching St. Lo and 
the battle there. Anthony was buried in France 
and his body was sent back to the U.S. He 
was buried in the U.S. Military Cemetery in 
Farmingdale Long Island, New York, on Feb-
ruary 3, 1948. 
Anthony was part of the Greatest Genera-
tion who served their country without reserva-
tion and gave their lives for our Nation. For his 
service to our country, Anthony was post-
humously awarded the Purple Heart, Euro-
pean-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal 
with 3 bronze service stars, WWII Victory 
Medal, and Honorable Service WWII Lapel 
Pin. A VFW Post was also dedicated in his 
name in Green Island, New York, his home-
town. 
Anthony’s courageous service helped to de-
fend our Nation’s democracy and ideals 
abroad at a crucial moment in world history. 
His heroism has charted the path for future 
generations of men and women who serve in 
the military. We are proud to have the Iozzo 
family call Colorado home and are forever in-
debted to Anthony for his bravery and sacrifice 
on behalf of our country. 
I extend my deepest appreciation to An-
thony Iozzo for his dedication, integrity, and 
outstanding service to the United States of 
America.

RECOGNIZING ASSYRIAN 
MEMORIAL DAY 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in recognition of Assyrian Memorial Day, 
which is observed annually on August 7th, to 
honor the memory of all Assyrians who fell 
victim to genocide, mass atrocities, and perse-
cution because of their ethnic and religious 
identity. This day commemorates the victims 
of the Assyrian Genocide of 1914–1923 and 
the Simele Massacre of 1933. August 7th 
marks the start of the Simele Massacre, dur-
ing which the armed forces of the Kingdom of 
Iraq systematically targeted and killed thou-
sands of Assyrians. Assyrian Memorial Day is 
an opportunity to pay tribute to the persever-
ance of the Assyrian people and revive efforts

to bring accountability and justice for these al-
most century-old crimes, 
While I rise to recognize the atrocities of the 
past, I also applaud the strength of the Assyr-
ian-American community. Today, over 600,000 
Assyrian Americans live in the United States, 
and I am proud to say that the 8th Congres-
sional District of Illinois is home to a large and 
thriving Assyrian-American community. This 
community has enriched our neighborhood 
with its strength and determination. As a proud 
cosponsor of H. Res. 550, a resolution com-
memorating the Assyrian Genocide and urging 
Turkey to officially recognize the atrocity, I 
stand in solidarity with the vibrant Assyrian- 
American community I represent. 
On August 7th, we remember the tragedies 
that the Assyrian people have faced but also 
recognize their resilience in the face of ex-
treme injustice. Madam Speaker, I call on my 
fellow Members to stand alongside me in ob-
serving August 7th as Assyrian Memorial Day.

HONORING BRENDA HORN OF 
CULLMAN, AL 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, today I 
would like to honor a distinguished citizen of 
Alabama’s Fourth Congressional District, Ms. 
Brenda Nelson Horn. Through her community 
contributions, and love for the people of Ala-
bama, her legacy will surely outlast us all. I 
hope that you will join me in honoring her 
memory. 
In 1960, Brenda was married to Darell 
Mullaney and they started their family imme-
diately. She was the proud mother of Mike, 
Scott and Matt Mullaney. Throughout their 
marriage, they lived in Jacksonville, Florida, 
St. Petersburg, Florida, Birmingham, Alabama 
and eventually back to Cullman, Alabama in 
1972. 
Brenda raised her sons in Cullman until 
1982 when she moved with her second hus-
band, Fred Horn to Orem, Utah. After two 
years in Utah, they moved briefly to Kentucky 
and then to Shelbyville, TN, where they start-
ed a self-storage business. 
She returned to Cullman in 1996 and, the 
following year, she began her work with 
Cullman Industrial Development (ID) Board. 
She became indispensable in the office deal-
ing with the record keeper for many functions 
including financing, contracts, legal docu-
ments, budgets, and invoicing. Brenda loved 
working for the Cullman Industrial Develop-
ment ID Board and developed close friend-
ships during her 25 years there. She consid-
ered those she worked with as her extended 
family. 
Brenda also made significant contributions 
in politics at both the local and state level. Her 
guidance and counsel were sought by many 
candidates for various offices. She managed 
the successful campaigns for candidates for 
the Alabama Legislature and Congress and 
provided consult counsel to many candidates 
for local offices. She served as Treasurer for 
both the Alabama Federation of Republican 
Women and the Cullman County Republican 
Party, as well as President of the Cullman 
County Republican Women. 
Her legacy is left to be cherished by her 
three sons Mike Mullaney and wife, Lisa; Matt 
Mullaney 
and 
wife, 
Melody, 
and 
Scott 
Mullaney; her sister Diane Brown and her hus-
band, Ken; brothers Maxie Nelson and wife, 
Cindy; and Bruce Nelson and wife, Mary Ellen; 
and grandchildren Christopher, Emily, Mitch, 
Kate, Dylan, Hunter, Brianna, McKenzie, 
Sean, and Haylee, as well as numerous 
nieces, nephews, extended family and friends. 
Ms. Horn’s dedication, patriotic spirit, and 
lifelong commitment to our state act as an ex-
ample for us all to look up to as we pursue 
public service. I ask that you join me as we 
commemorate the life of Brenda Nelson Horn, 
and honor her legacy in Cullman County, and 
the state of Alabama.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF SAMUEL ‘‘LOYD’’ NEAL 
HON. MICHAEL CLOUD 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, today, I wish 
to honor the life and legacy of Samuel ‘‘Loyd’’ 
Neal. 
Loyd Neal was a leader committed to serv-
ing his neighbors in Corpus Christi and 
Nueces County. 
Born in Paris, Texas, Loyd went on to join 
the United States Army and attend Texas 
A&M University. 
After graduating from Texas A&M in 1959, 
he married his high school sweetheart, Thetis, 
and they moved to Fort Benning, Georgia, 
where Loyd would report for Army Ranger 
School. 
In 1963, Loyd and Thetis moved to Corpus 
Christi and made it their permanent home. 
Corpus Christi gave Loyd his start in the in-
surance industry. 
His career in the industry lasted 40 years, 
alongside a 30-year career in the U.S. Army 
and Army Reserve. 
Loyd left the military in 1989 having attained 
the rank of colonel. 
In 1998, the City of Corpus Christi elected 
him to become mayor. 
He was re-elected three more times, and his 
8-year tenure was successful in facilitating the 
construction of the American Bank Center 
Arena, Whataburger Field, and updating the 
Harbor Bridge. 
His passion for his community made it dif-
ficult for Corpus Christi to let him go as their 
leader. 
Two years after he stepped down as mayor 
of Corpus Christi, he was elected to serve as 
Nueces County judge. 
He served in this role for 12 years, and peo-
ple leaned on him to help rebuild following 
Hurricane Harvey in 2017. 
Loyd’s service to the city and county went 
beyond that of official office. 
He volunteered his spare time to other orga-
nizations and groups dedicated to serving the 
Corpus Christi region. 
As a veteran, he was committed to helping 
members of our military and veterans. 
It was only natural that he would be ap-
pointed by Governors Bush and Perry to serve 
on both the Texas Strategic Military Planning 
Commission and the Texas Military Prepared-
ness Commission. 
He also championed local military bases 
and veterans on the South Texas Military Task 
Force. 
In addition to membership in these military 
organizations, Loyd served as president of the 
Texas Municipal League, chairman of the Cor-
pus Christi Economic Development Corpora-
tion, chairman of the Corpus Christi Chamber 
of Commerce, chairman of the I–69 Alliance,

From the Harbor Bridge to Whataburger 
Field, Loyd Neal’s impact on the community

His family and loved ones are in my prayers 
during this time of loss.

RECOGNIZING THE CITY OF KEY 
WEST’S 
DESIGNATION 
AS 
A 
‘‘COAST GUARD CITY’’ 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the City of Key West’s designa-
tion as a Coast Guard City. This designation, 
made official on August 4, 2022, at Truman 
Waterfront Park, pays tribute to the city’s long-
standing, fruitful, and supportive relationship 
with the United States Coast Guard (USCG). 
Since 1998, this legal designation has rec-
ognized communities that welcome Coast 
Guard servicemembers and their families with 
open arms. These cities support their local 
USCG families in a variety of ways—by build-
ing monuments, hosting picnics and parades, 
sponsoring patriotic events and awards, estab-
lishing partnerships with the local business 
community, and much more. To achieve this 
designation, a municipality submits a request 
explaining its history of supporting the Coast 
Guard. Only after a rigorous examination by 
Coast Guard Headquarters, the Commandant, 
and the appropriate congressional committees 
is a city finally proclaimed a Coast Guard City. 
The history of the Coast Guard in Key West 
traces back to 1823, when the U.S. Navy 
Antipirate Squadron settled on the island. 
Congress established a depot for naval sup-
plies in 1852. Nine years later, Key West be-
came the headquarters of the East Gulf Block-
age Squadron. Even before the Coast Guard 
was established in the early 20th century, Key 
West Headquarters performed the vital func-
tions of collecting import tariffs, capturing pi-
rates, interdicting smugglers, and rescuing 
those lost at sea. 
Today, the Coast Guard continues to serve 
the greater Key West community by patrolling 
the surrounding 55,000 square miles of water. 
In return, the City of Key West supports

USCG personnel in many ways. Quality-of-life 
initiatives, discounts, and sponsorships enrich 
the lives of Coast Guard servicernembers and 
families. The city integrates both Active-Duty 
and retired personnel into the fabric of all as-
pects of the community—business, education, 
and leisure. Parades, battle reenactments, and 
festivals celebrating the Coast Guard’s pres-
ence are a Key West staple. 
I am honored to celebrate this distinction for 
the City of Key West, and I also thank USCG 
Commandant Admiral Linda Fagan for her 
service to the Key West community. This des-
ignation reflects the deep, enduring relation-
ship between the city and the U.S. Coast 
Guard. May that relationship continue to flour-
ish for many decades to come.

HONORING UNITED WAY OF 
SUMNER COUNTY 
HON. JOHN W. ROSE 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor the tremendous work done by the vol-
unteers, employees, donors, and other advo-
cates of the United Way of Sumner County. 
For 45 years, the United Way of Sumner 
County has worked to improve the lives of oth-
ers by mobilizing the caring power of commu-
nities to advance the common good. They 
serve as the hub of a network that connects 
givers, advocates, and volunteers with local 
businesses, schools, government, and human 
service programs to make lives better and our 
community stronger. It takes a connected 
community to thrive, and that is exactly what 
the United Way of Sumner County strives to 
achieve. 
Their focus on education, financial stability, 
health, and rebuilding lives empowers every 
individual to achieve their full potential where 
it matters most—right here in Sumner County. 
This mindset leads them to invest in initiatives 
like the United for ALICE program, which aims 
to serve as a driver of innovation, research, 
and action to improve the lives of those across 
the county for Asset Limited, Income Con-
strained, Employed individuals, or ALICE indi-
viduals, as they are known. Through the de-
velopment of the ALICE metrics for measuring 
financial hardship, a comprehensive, unbiased 
picture emerges to help match the proper as-
sistance with the proper recipients. 
On August 11, 2022, the United Way of 
Sumner County will host a Community Impact 
Breakfast to celebrate and honor their partner 
agencies, donors, volunteers, and advocates 
who help improve the lives of people in Sum-
ner County through their involvement and 
work at United Way of Sumner County. 
This event, along with many others through-
out the year, is just one example of the work 
they do to better our community and the peo-
ple living within it. I encourage all my fellow 
Tennesseans to find a way to get involved 
with their local chapter of United Way, and 
there is no better chapter to engage with than 
the United Way of Sumner County. 
The United Way of Sumner County em-
bodies the spirit of the Volunteer State. I could 
not be prouder of these individuals who dedi-
cate their efforts to improving the community 
in Sumner County, Tennessee, and I am ex-
tremely thankful for the opportunity to recog-
nize them today. 
I thank Sumner County for all it does and 
may God continue to bless its incredible work.

HONORING VIRGINIA LODMELL 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of a patriotic American, Mrs. Virginia 
Mae Hudson Lodmell, on the occasion of her 
100th birthday. Mrs. Lodmell lives in Frankfort, 
Kentucky. 
Mrs. Lodmell was born in southern West 
Virginia on August 17, 1922. She graduated 
from Woodrow Wilson High School in Beckley 
and attended Beckley College. Wanting to 
support America’s war effort when World War 
II started, she went to work in an ammunition 
plant in Maryland. On December 18, 1943, 
she enlisted in the WAVES. Following basic 
training in New York, Mrs. Lodmell was as-
signed to Norman, Oklahoma, as an Aviation 
Mechanist Mate where she worked as an air-
plane mechanic. She also taught classes on 
radar. She was discharged on November 2, 
1945, as a 3rd Class Petty Officer. 
Following the war, she married Russell Carl 
Lodmell. They lived on a farm in Minnesota for 
several years then returned to West Virginia. 
She worked at a Montgomery Ward’s store 
until her retirement. Mrs. Lodmell has three 
sons, John, Joe, and Jim; nine grandchildren; 
and 27 great-grandchildren. She is a member 
of the United Methodist Church in Versailles. 
It is my honor to recognize Mrs. Lodmell, 
celebrate her 100th birthday and thank her for 
her service and sacrifice to our Nation during 
World War II. As a part of the Greatest Gen-
eration, Mrs. Lodmell and her fellow soldiers 
were a part of the war effort to preserve the 
freedoms that we enjoy today, and we can 
never thank them enough. I am forever grate-
ful for Americans like Virginia Lodmell.

RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE ALLEN FAIRVIEW 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize the Allen Fairview Chamber of 
Commerce as they celebrate their 40th Anni-
versary of excellence, while applauding their 
mission to advocate, educate and build busi-
ness relationships that enable our commu-
nities and its members to prosper. 
Formed in the early 1960s from the roots of 
the original Downtown Business Association, 
Don Rodenbaugh served as the organization’s 
first president. The Chamber would not be in-
corporated until 1982 for the purpose of ad-
vancing the general welfare and prosperity of 
the city of Allen and the Collin County area 
through economic, civic, commercial, cultural, 
industrial, and educational interests of the 
area and its citizens. 
In an effort to further their reach and grow 
new enterprises, in 2010 the Chamber ex-
panded to include businesses in the Town of 
Fairview, legally becoming the modern-day 
Allen Fairview Chamber of Commerce. 
Today, the Chamber has increased their 
membership to nearly 600, including a full-time 
staff of four, a board of directors made up of 
fifteen individuals from their general member-
ship, and six ex-officio members including the 
city manager, school superintendent, county 
commissioner, economic development direc-
tor, executive director of the small business 
development center, and their attorney of 
record. 
The membership of the Allen Fairview 
Chamber of Commerce, under the leadership 
of longtime Chief Executive Officer, Sharon 
Mayer, have invested their time and resources 
to ensure our community truly remains the 
best place to live, work and raise a family. 
Through it all, this organization has played a 
pivotal role in shaping the landscape of our 
Collin County business community and bol-
stering the entrepreneurial spirit that served as 
the backbone of our region. 
Now as we recognize the Allen Fairview 
Chamber of Commerce on this milestone oc-
casion, I ask my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring their 
forty years of exemplary service and wish 
them great success as they continue their im-
portant work.

THRIFTY FOOD PLAN 
HON. DAVID SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following 
letter from the Government Accountability Of-
fice. 
UNITED
STATES
DEPARTMENT
OF
AGRI-
CULTURE—APPLICABILITY OF THE CONGRES-
SIONAL REVIEW ACT TO THE 2021 UPDATES TO 
THE THRIFTY FOOD PLAN 
DECISION 
Matter of: United States Department of Ag-
riculture—Applicability of the Congres-
sional Review Act to the 2021 Updates to 
the Thrifty Food Plan. 
File: B–333732. 
Date: July 28, 2022. 
DIGEST 
The United States Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) issued a document entitled 
Thrifty Food Plan, 2021 (2021 TFP). The 2021 
TFP updates the market baskets used to de-
termine the value of Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to pur-
chase food from retail stores. 
The Congressional Review Act (CRA) re-
quires that before a rule can take effect, an 
agency must submit the rule to both the 
House of Representatives and the Senate as 
well as the Comptroller General, and pro-
vides procedures for congressional review 
where Congress may disapprove of rules. We 
conclude the 2021 TFP meets the definition 
of a rule under the CRA and no CRA excep-
tion applies. Therefore, the 2021 TFP is sub-
ject to the requirement that it be submitted 
to Congress.

We received a request for a decision as to 
whether the 2021 TFP is a rule for purposes 
of the Congressional Review Act (CRA). Let-

Managing Associate General Counsel, GAO 
(Feb. 11, 2022) (Response Letter). 
BACKGROUND 
Thrifty Food Plan 
The Thrifty Food Plan is defined by the 
Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 as a diet re-
quired to feed a family of four persons. See 7 
U.S.C. § 2012(u). The Act uses the cost of this 
diet as the basis for allotments to house-
holds regardless of their actual size. Id. 
These allotments take the form of Supple-
mental 
Nutrition 
Assistance 
Program 
(SNAP) benefits to purchase food from retail 
stores. See 7 U.S.C. § 2013. In order for a 
household to qualify for SNAP benefits its 
gross income cannot exceed the poverty line. 
See 7 U.S.C. § 2014(c). 
The 2018 Farm Bill amended the Thrifty 
Food Plan to require USDA to ‘‘re-evaluate 
and publish the market baskets of the 
thrifty food plan based on current food 
prices, food composition data, consumption 
patterns, and dietary guidance’’ by 2022 and 
at 5-year intervals thereafter. Agriculture 
Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill), 
Pub. L. No. 115–334, title IV, § 4002, 132 Stat. 
4490, 4624 (Dec. 20, 2018). On August 16, 2021, 
USDA 
published 
the 
2021 
TFP. 
USDA, 
Thrifty Food Plan, 2021 (August 2021), avail-
able at https://FNS.usda.gov/TFP (last vis-
ited Jul. 12, 2022). The 2021 TFP is the USDA 
update to the TFP market baskets required 
by the 2018 Farm Bill. 
The 2021 TFP describes the approach and 
methods used in reevaluating the Thrifty 
Food Plan. Prior to the 2021 reevaluation, 
the market basket prices were last updated 
in 2006. 2021 TFP at 30. The result of the 2021 
reevaluation is that the monthly cost of a 
market basket for the reference family of 
four is $835.57. 2021 TFP at 34. This represents 
an increase of $145.19 (in 2021 dollars) from 
the previous market basket price. See id. at 
34–35. The changes to the maximum SNAP 
benefit allotments based on the 2021 TFP 
were effective beginning October 1, 2021. 2021 
TFP at 51. 
The Congressional Review Act 
CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen con-
gressional oversight of agency rulemaking, 
requires federal agencies to submit a report 
on each new rule to both houses of Congress 
and to the Comptroller General for review 
before a rule can take effect. 5 U.S.C. 
§ 801(a)(1)(A). The report must contain a copy 
of the rule, ‘‘a concise general statement re-
lating to the rule,’’ and the rule’s proposed 
effective date. Id. An agency can find for 
good cause that notice and public procedure 
are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary 
to the public interest and the rule will then 
take effect at a time the agency determines. 
5 U.S.C. § 808(2). Each house of Congress is to 
provide the report on the rule to the chair-
man and ranking member of each standing 
committee 
with 
jurisdiction. 
5 
U.S.C. 
§ 801(a)(1)(C). CRA allows Congress to review 
and disapprove rules issued by federal agen-
cies for a period of 60 days using special pro-
cedures. See 5 U.S.C. § 802. If a resolution of 
disapproval is enacted, then the new rule has 
no force or effect. 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(1). 
CRA adopts the definition of rule under the 
Administrative 
Procedure 
Act 
(APA), 
5 
U.S.C. § 551(4), which states that a rule is 
‘‘the whole or a part of an agency statement 
of general or particular applicability and fu-
ture effect designed to implement, interpret, 
or prescribe law or policy or describing the 
organization, procedure, or practice require-
ments of an agency.’’ 5 U.S.C. § 804(3). CRA 
excludes three categories of rules from cov-
erage: (1) rules of particular applicability; (2) 
rules relating to agency management or per-
sonnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, 
procedure, or practice that do not substan-
tially affect the rights or obligations of non- 
agency parties. Id. 
USDA did not submit a CRA report to Con-
gress or the Comptroller General on the 2021 
TFP. In its response to us, USDA stated the 
2021 TFP was not subject to CRA because it 
was not a rule within the meaning of the 
APA or CRA. Response Letter, at 3–4. USDA 
also stated that it met the good cause excep-
tion under the CRA, and, thus, was not sub-
ject to the CRA’s submission requirements. 
See id. at 7–8. For the reasons explained 
below, we conclude that the 2021 TFP is a 
rule under the CRA, does not meet any of the 
exceptions that would exclude the rule from 
coverage, and is, therefore, subject to the 
submission requirement of CRA. 
ANALYSIS 
To determine whether the 2021 TFP is a 
rule subject to review under CRA, we first 
address whether the 2021 TFP meets the APA 
definition of a rule. As explained below, we 
conclude that it does. The next step, then, is 
to determine whether any of the CRA excep-
tions apply. We conclude that they do not. 
The 2021 TFP meets the APA definition of 
a rule upon which the CRA relies. First, the 
2021 TFP is an agency statement as it was 
issued by USDA to update market basket 
prices that were last revised in 2006. See 2021 
TFP at I. Second, the 2021 TFP is of future 
effect, as it provides guidance for new mar-
ket basket prices on which SNAP benefits 
will be based going forward, effective Octo-
ber I, 2021. Id. at 51. See B–316048, Apr. 17, 2008 
(finding that an agency action was of future 
effect because the action was prospective in 
nature since it was concerned with policy 
considerations for the future rather than the 
evaluation of past or present conduct). Fi-
nally, the 2021 TFP is designed to imple-
ment, interpret, or prescribe law or policy as 
it implements the new market baskets as re-
quired by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 
and the 2018 Farm Bill. 2021 TFP at 4–6. 
In its Response Letter, USDA asserts the 
2021 TFP is exempt from the APA’s rule 
making provisions because it relates to 
agency management and benefits, and, con-
sequently, it is not a rule. Response Letter 
at 4. We disagree with this rationale. Specifi-
cally, USDA notes that the APA requires no-
tice and comment for all rules ‘‘except to the 
extent that there is involved . . . a matter 
relating to agency management or personnel 
or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, 
or contracts.’’ [Emphasis removed.] Response 
Letter, at 4 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2)). 
USDA argues that ‘‘evaluating market bas-
kets based on current food prices is a matter 
relating to ‘agency management’ of [] SNAP 
and relates to SNAP ’benefits.’ ’’ Response 
Letter, at 4. However, the language USDA 
cites in 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2) pertains to an ex-
ception to the APA’s rule making process, 
not to the definition ofa rule. Even assuming 
the 2021 TFP is exempt from the APA’s no-
tice and comment requirement, that does 
not mean it is not a rule as defined by 5 
U.S.C. § 551(4). See B–323772, Sept. 4, 2012 (not-
ing the CRA is intended to include within its 
purview, almost all rules that an agency 
issues, not only those that must be promul-
gated according to the APA ’s notice and 
comment requirements). It should also be 
noted that 7 U.S.C. § 2013(c) specifically di-
rects USDA to promulgate regulations re-
lated to SNAP ‘‘in accordance with the pro-
cedures set forth in section 553 of title 5.’’ As 
discussed, the 2021 TFP is an agency state-
ment of future effect designed to implement 
policy, and, therefore, meets the definition 
of a rule. 
USDA contends that Congress did not re-
quire the 2021 TFP to be issued as a rule be-
cause Congress did not specifically require 
the 2021 TFP to be subject to CRA. Response 
Letter, at 5. We disagree with this interpre-
tation of CRA. We conduct our analysis 
under CRA which requires all rules to follow 
the procedures outlined in 5 U.S.C. § 801. All 
rules are subject to the procedures required 
by CRA, whether or not Congress specifically 
requires it, before they can take effect. 5 
U.S.C. § 801. 
USDA also argues that Congress had con-
structive notice that the 2021 TFP would in-
crease SNAP benefits and, as a result, USDA 
was not required to provide formal CRA no-
tice to Congress. Response Letter, at 5-7. 
However, constructive notice is not an ex-
ception to CRA notice procedures. As dis-
cussed above, CRA is a method of congres-
sional oversight of agency rulemaking. CRA 
requires agencies to submit a report to Con-
gress about the rule. 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(])(A). 
The submission of this report initiates the 
congressional review process which can lead 
to Congress disapproving a rule. 5 U.S.C. 
§ 801(b)(I). It is the report that triggers the 
CRA review process. As a result, construc-
tive notice of a rule is not the same as sub-
mitting a formal report as required by CRA. 
While there are exceptions for waiving a 
delay in the effective date of a rule, 5 U.S.C. 
§ 808, there are no exceptions for submitting 
a report. 
Having concluded that the 2021 TFP meets 
the APA definition of a rule, we now tum to 
whether any of the three CRA exceptions 
apply. We also address USDA’s argument 
that the good cause exception provides an 
exemption from the CRA’s submission re-
quirement. As explained below, we conclude 
they do not. 
First, the 2021 TFP is not a rule of par-
ticular applicability. Rules of particular ap-
plicability are addressed to specific, identi-
fied entities. See Administrative Conference 
of the United States, Miscellaneous State-
ments, 39 Fed. Reg. 4846, 4849 (Feb. 7, 1974) 
(explaining that a rule of general applica-
bility is one with an open class but a rule of 
particular applicability is limited to those 
named). The 2021 TFP applies to all families 
whose income falls below the poverty line 
and is not addressed to specific, identified 
entities. Therefore, it is a rule of general ap-
plicability and not a rule of particular appli-
cability. 
Second, this is not a rule relating to agen-
cy management or personnel. A rule relates 
to agency management or personnel if it ap-
plies to agency employees and not to outside 
parties. See e.g. B–331324, Oct. 22, 2019 (deter-
mining that 5 U.S.C. § 804(3)(b) does not apply 
when the rule deals with actions a bank 
should take and not agency management or 
personnel). The 2021 TFP deals with the 
amount of SNAP benefits for qualifying fam-
ilies and, the market basket costs in the 2021 
TFP apply broadly to the contiguous 48 
states and the District of Columbia.

August 5, 2022 
Finally, the 2021 TFP substantially im-
pacts the rights of non-agency parties be-
cause it has an effect on qualifying families 
by granting increased benefit allotments de-
signed for them to obtain a more nutritious 
diet. 
USDA contends the 2021 TFP meets the 
good cause exception under the CRA, and, 
therefore, USDA was not required to follow 
the CRA’s submission requirements. Re-
sponse Letter, at 7–8. In its response USDA 
stated that good cause existed to issue the 
2021 TFP with an effective date in August 
2021. Id. at 8. USDA further stated that this 
excepted it from carrying out formal CRA 
notice before the effective date. Id. While 
CRA does not provide an emergency excep-
tion from its procedural requirements to 
submit rules for congressional review, CRA 
and APA address an agency’s need to take 
emergency action without delay. Agencies 
can waive the required delay in effective 
date requirement when an agency for ‘‘good 
cause’’ finds (and incorporates the finding 
and a brief statement of reasons in the rule 
issued) that notice and public procedure are 
‘‘impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to 
the public interest.’’ 5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b), 808(2). 
Therefore, an agency can provide for a rule 
to take effect immediately while still com-
plying with the agency’s statutory obliga-
tion to submit the rule to Congress for re-
view. Asserting a good cause exception does 
not serve to waive the CRA’s submission re-
quirements all together. Notably, the 2021 
TFP did not incorporate a finding or state-
ment of the reasons why there is good cause 
for an exception to the CRA’s procedural 
rules to submit the 2021 TFP for congres-
sional review, nor did the 2021 TFP include 
an immediate effective date. Therefore, 
USDA did not properly apply the good cause 
exception. 
Thus, we conclude that none of the three 
exceptions that would exclude the rule from 
CRA coverage, or the good cause exception 
apply, and the 2021 TFP is subject to the sub-
mission requirement of CRA. 
CONCLUSION 
The 2021 TFP is a rule for purposes of CRA 
because it meets the APA definition of a rule 
and no CRA exception applies. Therefore,

COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
ILLINOIS 
CORN 
GROWERS ASSOCIATION 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I am proud 
to honor the Illinois Corn Growers Association 
(ICGA) on their 50th Anniversary. The Illinois 
Corn Growers Association is a vital organiza-
tion in our state that works to support the agri-
cultural economy and advocate public policies 
that help promote success and sustainability 
for farmers across Illinois. 
Ilinois farmers are leaders in the production 
of corn. The ICGA has united farm families 
since 1972 to increase market opportunities 
for corn domestically and around the world. 
The ICGA provides a voice for farmers in Illi-
nois to help promote best practices in the in-
dustry and foster stewardship of the land. The 
association also educates the public and co-
ordinates policies that advance the biofuels in-
dustry and drives innovation in how we 
produce and use corn throughout the world. 
I extend my sincere congratulations to ICGA 
members for their achievements over the 
years. Agriculture is the number one industry 
in Illinois. Advocacy groups like ICGA have 
helped shape the industry into what it is today 
and will help lead the industry into the future. 
I wish the organization many more years of 
success.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
ANDREW 
‘‘ANDY’’ 
TENORIO 
LAGUAN˜ A 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Andrew 
‘‘Andy’’ Tenorio Laguan˜a. Andy was an es-
teemed architect, preservationist, and advo-
cate who uniquely elevated the stories of our 
people while physically raising and trans-
forming countless spaces in our community. 
We will fondly remember him as a talented vi-
sionary whose ideas, work, and art have 
meaningfully shaped the face and future of our 
island. 
Andy was a pioneering force of CHamoru 
architecture, engineering, design, construction, 
conception, site planning, and historic preser-
vation. After graduating from Father Duenas 
Memorial School in 1968, he went on to earn 
both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in ar-
chitecture from Iowa State University and the 
University of California Berkeley respectively, 
later emerging as part of the first generation of 
island-born architects from Guam. Establishing 
a respected career and professional record 
over the years, Andy registered as an archi-
tect in both California and Guam, obtained 
certification from the National Council of Archi-
tectural Registration Boards, and navigated 
many professional opportunities at the cul-
mination of his formal education. From 1975 to 
1989, Andy assumed roles as Senior Project 
Designer and Vice President of Hellmuth, 
Obata, Kassabaum Architects in San Fran-
cisco. He then returned home to serve as 
Principal and Partner of Martin, Cristobal, 
Laguan˜a Architects then Architects Laguan˜a & 
Cristobal, LLC, and finally, as Principal and 
Owner of Architects Laguan˜a from 2009 until 
the date of his passing on July 14, 2022. 
With over 45 years of experience, Andy’s 
creativity and contributions reached far and 
wide—spanning the entirety of our island and 
region, and impacting populations across the 
Pacific. Over the decades, his demonstrated 
focus on large-scale government, office, and 
commercial building projects catalyzed the re-
alization of remarkable architectural achieve-
ments including the new construction, renova-
tion, and revitalization of John F. Kennedy 
High School, the Southern Regional Commu-
nity Health Center, Saint Fidelis Friary, the 
GWA Compliance Laboratory, Farmers’ Coop-
erative Facility and relocation of the Flea Mar-
ket, our capital city of Haga˚tn˜a, Cathedral, 
University of Guam, and the prominent Guam 
Museum. His leadership informed and defines 
our island’s building environment through 
years of hands-on guidance to other profes-
sionals in his field, advocacy to update 
Guam’s Building Code and adopt the Inter-
national 
Conference 
of 
Building 
Officials 
(ICBO) International Code, and tireless com-
mitment to honoring unique aspects of our in-
digenous culture. More specifically, Andy 
played a key role in both the preservation of 
endangered sites and promotion of eth-
nography and oral history projects. 
A longstanding pillar in our community, 
Andy further served in numerous organiza-
tional capacities as chairman of the Guam 
Preservation Trust and Guam Historic Preser-
vation Review Board, member and chairman 
of the Professional Engineers, Architects, and 
Land Surveyors (PEALS) Board, member of 
the University of Guam Board of Regents, rep-
resentative of the National Architectural Ac-
crediting Board Accreditation Team, and board 
member of the Young Men’s League (YML) of 
Guam. His invaluable personal and profes-
sional accomplishments have also earned him 
several prestigious awards and recognitions 
ranging from being the first recipient of the 
AIA Guam and Micronesia Chapter’s Scholar-
ship to attend the UC Berkeley College of En-
vironmental Design to obtaining the Most Out-
standing Cultural Tourism Project Award from 
the Guam Visitors Bureau, Winning Finn of 
Design Competition for the Guam Museum, 
YML 2008 Member of the Year Award, 2010 
PEALS Board Golden Jubilee Achievement, 
2010 Guam Chamber of Commerce Na’ La’ 
Bonita Guam Award, a Western Conference of 
Architectural Registration Boards laudatory 
resolution, and the Governor’s Award. 
Andrew ‘‘Andy’’ Tenorio Laguan˜a is an icon 
of service and ingenuity who continues to in-
spire generations of rising architects, local 
community leaders, and global citizens alto-
gether. He did not simply make history as the 
first CHamoru to be elevated to the status of 
Fellow by the American Institute of Architects 
and first Guam architect to chair Region 6 of 
the National Council of Architectural Registra-
tion Boards, he left a lasting mark on it by 
quite literally cementing identity and culture 
into the projects he pursued. My family and I 
wish to extend our hearts and prayers for 
Andy; his wife, Joanne; their daughters, 
Jerusa and Drew Ann; and the rest of their 
family and friends, and I join the people of 
Guam in remembering and celebrating his life 
and legacy of directing one’s knowledge, 
skills, and passions toward uplifting and re-
sponding to the needs of their community. 
Andy will be dearly missed, and his love and 
memories will forever remain in the hearts of 
the people of Guam.

RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-

YARD THEATRE 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize the Plano Arts Coalition as they 
celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the Plano 
Courtyard Theatre. One of the oldest public 
buildings in Plano, the Courtyard Theatre 
serves as a center of cultural enrichment and 
exemplifies the social heritage of our commu-
nity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E829 
August 5, 2022 
Located in downtown Plano, the Courtyard 
Theatre was originally constructed in 1938 as 
the gymnasium for Plano Independent School 
District’s Cox High School as a Works 
Progress Administration Project. After years of 
vacancy, in 1999 the structure was restored 
and transformed into a state-of the-art per-
formance hall as part of then-Assistant City 
Manager Frank Turner’s vision to revitalize the 
city’s downtown area. During this same period, 
members of the community expressed a de-
sire for a theatre to hold community and re-
gional events, ultimately contributing to the se-
lection of the multi-functional Cox Gymnasium. 
Upon completion, the newly renovated 
Courtyard Theatre was capable of housing 
musical performances, theater productions, 
choirs, dance troupes, and other community 
events. As a historic and architectural land-
mark, the Theatre provides its patrons with a 
unique perspective that lends itself to a more 
intimate connection with audience members. 
Community engagement and continued invest-
ment from the city resulted in the project’s ulti-
mate success and in the City of Plano earning 
the prestigious ‘‘Downtown Arts Designation’’ 
by the State of Texas Cultural Arts Commis-
sion. 
As we reflect on the rich history of this 
treasured institution, I ask my colleagues in 
the United States House of Representatives to 
join me in recognizing the Plano Courtyard 
Theatre and its team on their milestone anni-
versary and wish them continued success as 
they continue to ensure the city remains one 
of the best places to live, work, and raise a 
family.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
FOX 
VALLEY 
UNITED WAY 
HON. BILL FOSTER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Fox Val-
ley United Way. Since 1922, United Way’s nu-
merous grants and programs have provided 
invaluable resources to our community, acting 
as the backbone of many different social serv-
ices programs. 
Throughout their 100 years, Fox Valley 
United Way has been inspiring hope for a 
brighter future, first in Aurora, and today in 23 
communities throughout Kane and Kendall 
counties. They have continually invested in the 
health, education, and financial stability of the 
families in these communities, laying the foun-
dation for each community to grow and thrive 
into the future. 
United Way’s programs provide assistance 
and support at many different stages of a fam-
ily’s development. For example, the SPARK 
early childhood program gives students enter-
ing kindergarten the tools they need to suc-
ceed. Kane County 211 has filled a crucial 
gap in social services resources by providing 
referrals to services for those with nowhere 
else to turn. Through these, and many other 
valuable programs, United Way has proved 
their commitment to aiding the communities 
they serve in whatever way possible. 
Fox Valley United Way is a vital resource to 
this community. Not only have they created an 
incredible wealth of resources of their own, 
they have supported and continue to support 
other local social services and programs to 
maximize the good they put out into their com-
munity. Their investments in the health, edu-
cation, and financial stability of local families 
are commendable, and I am grateful to join in 
the celebration of this organization and its pro-
lific contributions to the community. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in wishing United Way 
all the best for another 100 years of service.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY MIKE 
FLYNN’S RETIREMENT 
HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, for over 
30 years, Mike Flynn has served as the Dis-
trict Attorney General for Tennessee’s Fifth 
Judicial District. Today, it’s my honor to recog-
nize his distinguished career and congratulate 
him on his retirement. 
Mike grew up in Maryville, Tennessee, and 
attended the University of Tennessee for his 
undergraduate and law degrees. He has a 
love for East Tennessee and, in 1990, chose 
to run for the District Attorney General position 
in his home county where he has served ever 
since. 
Mike has a real heart for crime victims, and 
he fights to make the justice system work for 
them. Once, when he was asked why he ran 
for the position, he said, ‘‘I ran for District At-
torney General because I felt that the voices 
of my victims were often overlooked. Through-
out my career, I have attempted to listen to 
victims and make them a part of the criminal 
justice system.’’ That kind of mentality greatly 
benefits our American system of justice. 
Mike also played an active role in starting a 
Recovery Court program in Blount County. 
These recovery courts put individuals with 
mental health and substance abuse disorders 
in treatment programs so they can recover 
and make better lives for themselves instead 
of relapsing once they finish serving their time. 
I’m pleased to congratulate Mike on his re-
tirement after 32 years of service to the Blount 
County community. I wish him all the best as 
he enters the next chapter of his life.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
AGNES LOUISE WINDSOR 
HON. BARRY MOORE 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 5, 2022 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
today, I recognize the life of Agnes Louise 
Windsor, who sadly passed away on Tuesday, 
July 26, 2022, at the age of 89. 
Agnes Louise Windsor impacted thousands 
of young lives through her time as an educator 
and local historian of Slocomb, Alabama. She 
was a tireless volunteer who served on local, 
county, state, and national boards for service 
projects during her career, which spanned 
sixty-eight years. 
Mrs. Windsor’s drive to make a difference in 
her community led her to dedicating her life to 
volunteerism and serving others. She has re-
ceived recognition for her outstanding leader-
ship and tireless efforts in addressing and 
raising awareness about issues to include 
hunger, literacy, GED classes, senior con-
cerns and welfare, children’s educational 
issues, political concerns and voter education 
and registration. 
Because of her efforts, Mrs. Windsor earned 
numerous awards and has the gratitude of 
those she served, her church family, commu-
nity, and her peers. Her achievements include 
numerous teacher of the year and vol-
unteerism awards, notably the Volunteer Ac-
tion Award presented by President George 
H.W. Bush in 1990, as well as the NAACP 
Image Award in 2016. 
Agnes Louise Windsor was an upstanding 
and respected citizen of Alabama’s 2nd Dis-
trict who left lifelong impressions on many stu-
dents and community members. She will be 
sorely missed by many friends, family mem-
bers, and all those she taught.
