WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 2020 
No. 213 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Ms. MCCOLLUM).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
December 16, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable BETTY 
MCCOLLUM to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 1:50 
p.m.

REJECTING LIBERAL LOCKDOWNS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, liberal Governors across the 
country have shown they know nothing 
about good governance. 
Many times I have heard impassioned 
speeches from my Republican col-
leagues on how liberal Governors run-
ning their States have gone off the 
deep end. Today, I am here to share 
North Carolina’s story. 
For months, Governor Roy Cooper 
has avoided numerous opportunities to 
keep North Carolina open for business. 
He imposed phases of reopening that 
only caused more businesses to go 
under while he claimed it was the best 
option. 
Now he believes a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. 
curfew will somehow eliminate COVID– 
19 altogether. What this curfew will do 
in the end is remind North Carolinians 
that their Governor has no idea what 
he is doing. 
COVID–19 is not a creature that 
roams the streets in the dead of night 
and retreats to its burrow once day-
break hits. This is a virus. Necessary 
safety precautions can be taken to pro-
tect yourself, your loved ones, and 
those around you. 
But when ill-conceived directives 
from Governor Cooper come into play, 
North Carolinians begin to question 
where the ambition ends and where 
leadership begins. 
The American people hear time and 
time again that we must follow the 
science, but when we question the 
science 
that 
is 
used 
to 
justify 
lockdowns, we seldom receive true 
clarity. 
We can all agree that the imperative 
here is to protect people from the 
scourge of the virus. That is abun-
dantly clear. However, that imperative 
becomes horribly diluted when State 
and local economies suffer, people lose 
their jobs, and ends can’t be met be-
cause of lockdowns. That is the sad re-
ality of what lockdowns can do. 
I have a message for Governor Coo-
per: Your abject failures during this 
pandemic have hurt the livelihoods of 
people who are proud to call North 
Carolina home. The last thing North 
Carolinians need is a bureaucrat sit-
ting in the Governor’s mansion who 
hands down blanketed mandates. 
Hopefully, 
Governors 
across 
the 
country, including yourself, will look 
to common sense as a guide moving 
forward; but based on what has been 
done to date, you would probably 
squander that opportunity, too. 
Leadership is not a foreign concept. 
So why not lead the right way and put 
aside your desire to see North Carolina 
closed for business? 
North Carolina is an economic power-
house because of its hardworking citi-
zens who show up to work and get the 
job done. It is high time it is treated 
that way. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair and not to a per-
ceived viewing audience.

HONORING THE LIVES OF 
GUADALUPE AND MARIA LOPEZ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise to honor Guada-
lupe and Maria Lopez, who were taken 
from us by COVID–19 in Chicago only a 
few weeks ago. 
Like thousands during this pan-
demic, their children—Erica, Richie, 
and Andy—weren’t even able to say a 
proper good-bye. 
Guadalupe and Maria were loving 
parents, 
grandparents, 
and 
active 
members of the community who raised 
their family in Archer Heights in Chi-
cago. 
Lupe, as most people knew him, was 
a beloved 911 dispatcher for 33 years. 
Chicago police officers described him 
as a ‘‘voice of security and reassur-
ance’’ who guided them on the radio 
through some of the most dangerous 
situations. Colleagues remember him 
as always ready to help jump-start a 
car or change a tire, even after a long, 
stressful shift. 
Maria owned an income tax service in 
my neighborhood of Little Village. She 
served the community and, particu-
larly, immigrants with kindness and 
dedication.

Lupe and Maria’s marriage was a 
love story, and their children and 
grandchildren were the center of their 
universe. They are reunited in Heaven. 
My wife, Evelyn, and I are keeping 
the Lopez family in our prayers.

BRIGHTER DAYS AHEAD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, this week, Americans wit-
nessed a remarkable achievement. Less 
than a year after the novel coronavirus 
reached the shores of America, the first 
doses of a safe and effective vaccine 
were 
administered 
to 
frontline 
healthcare workers in Pennsylvania 
and around the country. 
This amazing accomplishment is not 
only a testament to America’s unparal-
leled healthcare heroes, researchers 
and scientists, but it is also a testa-
ment to the promise of American inno-
vation. 
In just a matter of months, Oper-
ation Warp Speed has harnessed the 
full power of the Federal Government, 
the private sector, and the scientific 
community to deliver results for the 
American people, all in record time. 
I am sincerely grateful to the leaders 
at the helm of this historic public/pri-
vate partnership, including President 
Donald Trump and Secretary of Health 
and Human Services Alex Azar, who 
was born in my district, in Johnstown, 
Pennsylvania. Truly, all of those who 
have served in Operation Warp Speed 
have done an incredible job. 
As our Nation continues to combat 
the COVID–19 pandemic, we recognize 
that a safe and effective vaccine is key 
to restoring our communities, rebuild-
ing our economy and, ultimately, sav-
ing lives. While the first COVID–19 vac-
cine developed by Pfizer already has 
been granted emergency authorization 
from the FDA, we expect more to fol-
low in the coming days and weeks. 
Now, it is imperative for the Amer-
ican people to know the facts about 
these vaccines so that they can make 
informed consent. 
Number one: As part of Operation 
Warp Speed, multiple COVID–19 vac-
cines are being developed by private 
companies and simultaneously pro-
duced, accelerating the typical produc-
tion process so that, as soon as a safe 
and effective option is cleared, it is 
ready to go. 
Number two: Each COVID–19 vaccine 
is undergoing the same rigorous safety, 
quality, and efficacy screenings as any 
other modern vaccine. 
Number three: The FDA will only 
grant emergency use authorization to a 
vaccine following the recommendation 
of an independent advisory board. 
Number four: The American people 
can be confident in the safety and the 
efficacy of a COVID–19 vaccine. 
Madam Speaker, like many Ameri-
cans, I recognize that this vaccine has 
lifesaving potential, and I plan to take 
the vaccine as soon as I am eligible. 
As part of Operation Warp Speed, our 
Nation is equipped to facilitate this 
vaccine distribution more efficiently 
than any other country in the world. 
At the same time, we know that it will 
take time before everyone can receive 
it. 
As we wait, this is not the time to 
grow complacent. COVID–19 cases are 
rising in Pennsylvania and around the 
country, and it is up to all of us to do 
our part to protect our family, our 
friends, and our neighbors. 
This year, I have been amazed by 
Americans’ commitment to one an-
other and to their communities. To-
gether, we can defeat this virus. As we 
wait for the widespread immunization, 
we must continue to stand strong 
against this invisible enemy. 
Yes, the coronavirus remains an 
ever-present threat to America and to 
our economy. Yes, we are in a shared 
fight to save lives and to save liveli-
hoods. And, yes, there is hope on the 
horizon. It is arriving in communities 
every day in the coolers on UPS and 
FedEx trucks. 
As we near the end of this incredibly 
challenging 
year, 
Americans 
have 
much to be grateful for. Thanks to our 
scientific community, to Operation 
Warp Speed, and especially to our 
healthcare heroes, there are brighter 
days ahead. 
f 
MOBILITY, INNOVATION, AND 
PLACEMAKING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to the importance and 
interrelationship of mobility, innova-
tion and placemaking. 
In honor of my predecessor, the late 
Honorable John Lewis, I am happy to 
offer the John Lewis TOD Innovation 
Loop. The John Lewis TOD Innovation 
Loop envisions spurring over $5 billion 
of economic development in Georgia’s 
Fifth District in honor of the legacy of 
Congressman John Lewis’ sacrifice and 
commitment to equity, justice, and 
economic empowerment. 
Specifically, this project provides an 
opportunity to achieve justice in mo-
bility and placemaking through stra-
tegic land use and transit-oriented de-
velopment. 
Campbellton Road, a major artery of 
this project, is the area where both of 
Congressman Lewis’ homes were lo-
cated. This funding will ultimately cre-
ate a snowball effect for signature 
catalytic 
projects, 
such 
as 
Fort 
McPherson TOD, Tyler Perry Studios, 
Greenbriar, and Westgate redevelop-
ments. 
One of the first projects in the John 
Lewis TOD Innovation Loop is high-ca-
pacity transit in the Campbellton Road 
corridor. The project will introduce 
Light Rail Transit or Bus Rapid Tran-
sit to the area served by one the city’s 
busiest bus routes. 
All told, this will create billions of 
dollars 
of 
economic 
revitalization, 
which will result in greater transpor-
tation options, better quality of life, 
and renewed civic engagement. I en-
courage my colleagues to support this 
project. 
I include in the RECORD an appropria-
tions request in honor of John Lewis. 
CONGRESSMAN KWANZA HALL, 
5th District, Georgia, December 14, 2020. 
THE JOHN LEWIS TOD INNOVATION LOOP—TO-
WARDS
JUSTICE
IN
MOBILITY
AND 
PLACEMAKING 
I am happy to submit this extraordinary 
appropriations request in honor of John 
Lewis. The John Lewis TOD Innovation Loop 
envisions spurring over $5 Billion of eco-
nomic development in Georgia’s Fifth Dis-
trict in honor of the legacy of Congressman 
John Lewis’ sacrifice and commitment to eq-
uity, justice and economic empowerment. 
Specifically this project provides an oppor-
tunity to achieve justice in mobility (trans-
portation) and placemaking through stra-
tegic land use and transit oriented develop-
ment (TOD). Campbellton Road, a major ar-
tery of this project, is the area where both of 
Congressman Lewis’ homes were located. 
IMMEDIATE 2020 FUNDING REQUEST FOR THE 
JOHN LEWIS TOD INNOVATION LOOP 
1. $5M for development of the conceptual 
plan. 
2. $50M for Accelerated Campbellton Road 
Bus Rapid Transit project. 
This funding will ultimately create a snow-
ball effect for signature catalytic projects 
listed below. Their estimated economic im-
pacts are: 
Fort McPherson TOD / Tyler Perry Stu-
dios, $800M. 
Oakland City TOD, $200M. 
Campbellton Road or Bus Rapid Transit 
and future Light Rail, $50M/$250M. 
Greenbriar—Westgate Area, $1B. 
John Lewis Senior Transit Center @ Barge 
Rd, $500M. 
Camp Creek @ Campbellton Road, $200M. 
Campbellton @ Fulton Industrial, $200M. 
Fulton Industrial @ MLK Drive, $200M. 
Aerotropolis (Atlanta Airport Area), $1.7B. 
Total impact: $5.05 Billion. 
One of the first projects in the John Lewis 
TOD Innovation Loop is high-capacity tran-
sit in the Campbellton Road Corridor. This 
project will assist in transforming this cor-
ridor of established neighborhoods and busi-
nesses into a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly, 
mixed-use community and could incentivize 
major redevelopment efforts at Greenbriar 
Mall and Fort McPherson. The project will 
introduce Light Rail Transit or Bus Rapid 
Transit to the area served by one of the 
city’s busiest bus routes. The budget is $50 
million and the project would be adminis-
tered by Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Au-
thority.

PROBLEMS IN AMERICA’S PRISONS 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to draw the Chamber’s attention 
to a second problem, a problem in 
America’s prisons. 
I include in the RECORD the following 
hyperlink to an article from Reuters: 
https://www.reuters.com/investigates/ 
section/usa-jails. 
The article draws attention to the 
private prisons, the death penalty, and 
COVID. These are longstanding chal-
lenges in our criminal justice system.

mentioned in that article, are life sen-
tences, the Federal sentencing guide-
lines, and solitary confinement. 
I am supplementing to this state-
ment and to the article an appropria-
tions proposal. Were it here during the 
appropriations process, I would submit 
this proposal so that it may be inte-
grated into future appropriations vehi-
cles. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of several 
pieces of legislation that I am proud to co- 
sponsor on behalf of the people of Georgia’s 
5th Congressional District. 
First, I will highlight several pieces of legis-
lation critical to fighting the COVID–19 pan-
demic. As a survivor of COVID–19, I know 
firsthand the pain and difficulty this terrible dis-
ease has caused too many Americans. 
Health care is a right, not a privilege. Ensur-
ing that every American has high-quality 
health care is never more important than dur-
ing a pandemic that has claimed nearly 
300,000 American lives. That is why I support 
H.R. 6317, the Ensuring Coverage in Public 
Health Emergencies Act, introduced by the 
gentleman from Texas, Mr. DOGGETT, and 
hope to be added as a co-sponsor this week. 
This bill would create a special 30-day enroll-
ment period during public health emergencies 
to allow employees to enroll in health plans. It 
also would require coverage of services like 
vaccines, diagnostic testing, and treatment 
and care. 
As we fight the pandemic, it is critical to ad-
dress the racial and ethnic disparities in how 
COVID–19 
affects 
Americans. 
Systemic 
health, economic, and social inequities mean 
that minority communities have borne the 
worst of this terrible disease—in cases, 
deaths, jobs lost, and pay cut. We are, sadly, 
not all in this together. H.R. 6585, the Equi-
table Data Collection and Disclosure on 
COVID–19 Act, and H.R. 6763, the COVID–19 
Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force Act, 
were both introduced by the gentlewoman 
from Illinois, Ms. KELLY. These bills will pro-
vide critical information and attention to this 
problem and help to mitigate the effects that 
this disease has had on communities like the 
ones I represent, and I look forward to being 
added as a co-sponsor. 
Black women experience some of the worst 
systemic disparities in health, housing, em-
ployment, and education. I am proud to sup-
port two other bills co-sponsored by Congress-
woman KELLY of Illinois and hope to be added 
as a co-sponsor. H.R. 8196, the Protect Black 
Women and Girls Act would establish an Inter-
agency Task Force to examine the complex 
problems and make recommendations for pol-
icy changes to help increase opportunity for 
our mothers, sisters, and daughters. H.R. 
1897, the Mothers and Offspring Mortality and 
Morbidity Awareness (MOMMA’s) Act, will di-
rect federal resources to prevent maternal 
mortality and expand Medicaid to cover one 
year of postpartum needs. Georgia faces a cri-
sis: My state has the worst maternal mortality 
rate in the country, and many women, particu-
larly women of color, lack access to critical 
pre- and postpartum services and lack health 
insurance. We know that we all do better 
when we all do better, and as we rebuild our 
country from the ruin caused by the pandemic, 
we must leave no one behind. 
During a time in which we need people to 
stay home as much as possible, but people 
have lost jobs and income, it is more critical 
than ever to provide critical housing assist-
ance. The CARES Act provided many home-
owners with the right to have all mortgage 
payments completely paused for a period of 
time. Renters, however, face a patchwork of 
regulations across the country that leave them 
in more uncertain positions. That is why I co- 
sponsored H.R. 6820, the Emergency Rental 
Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization 
Act, introduced by Mr. HECK of Washington. 
This bill would provide $100 million in emer-
gency assistance to help prevent people at 
risk of homelessness from finding themselves 
on the street. Especially as coronavirus cases 
rise and as the weather gets colder, we must 
ensure that as many people as possible are 
able to safely find the protection and dignity of 
their own home. 
Our nation’s experience with COVID–19 has 
highlighted this country’s need for paid family 
and medical leave. H.R. 1185, the FAMILY 
Act, introduced by the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut, Ms. DELAURO, would create a new 
paid family and medical leave system run by 
the Social Security Administration. Under this 
system, workers and employers would split the 
very modest cost of the program. Paid leave 
benefits employers and employees alike— 
workers have time and flexibility to help them-
selves or their families through personal cri-
ses, while employers can afford to keep 
trained workers on the job. But the United 
States is the only rich nation without it. Paid 
leave would have helped save countless jobs 
and businesses during this difficult year. 
Sadly, COVID–19 is not the only epidemic 
facing the American people. This summer, the 
rest of the country was reminded of what my 
constituents in Metro Atlanta know all too well: 
that people of color, particularly African-Ameri-
cans, face systemic racism every day. Some-
times, this discrimination manifests itself as 
unnecessary and brutal police violence, as we 
saw in the murders of George Floyd, Breanna 
Taylor, and, in my district, Rayshard Brooks. 
Black Lives Matter, and their Black Lives 
Mattered. 
I have co-sponsored legislation to ensure 
police treat citizens with dignity and respect 
and are accountable to the communities they 
serve. First, I am proud to introduce a bill 
aimed at abolishing qualified immunity, which 
helps shield police officers who break the law 
from accountability. H.R. 4408, the Eric Gar-
ner Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act, 
introduced by the chairman of our caucus, Mr. 
JEFFRIES of New York, would forbid the use of 
police chokeholds. I also support H.R. 7100, 
the George Floyd Enforcement Trust and In-
tegrity Act, introduced by the gentlewoman 
from Texas, Ms. JACKSON LEE. This com-
prehensive legislation improves accountability 
by introducing new accreditation standards re-
lated to use of force, civilian review, and other 
provisions like training and data collection. 
We also must do all we can to erase the bit-
ter legacy left by enslavement and forced 
bondage. H.R. 40, sponsored by the gentle-
woman from Texas, Ms. JACKSON LEE, would 
create a commission to study and develop 
reparations proposals for African-Americans. 
Black communities today still suffer from the 
wages, property, and rights stolen by slavery 
and Jim Crow. We must also work to end the 
forced labor that still exists due to mass incar-
ceration, and I am proud to introduce a con-
stitutional amendment to end that horrific prac-
tice that perpetuates human suffering. 
H.R. 7217, the Confederate Monument Re-
moval Act, introduced by the gentlewoman 
from California, Ms. LEE, would remove all 
Confederate memorials from the United States 
Capitol, so that we do not risk perpetuating 
the myths of white supremacy to a new, more 
diverse, more inclusive generation of Ameri-
cans. I strongly support efforts in the Georgia 
General Assembly to replace the state’s statue 
of Alexander Stephens in Statuary Hall with 
one honoring my predecessor and friend, the 
late Honorable John Lewis. Congressman 
Lewis challenged the historical status quo in 
the South by championing civil and human 
rights through peaceful, dramatic, nonviolent 
action, dating from his tenure as president of 
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Com-
mittee and including his 17 terms serving in 
this House. 
I am also proud to join two other bills impor-
tant to my constituents. 
H.R. 2975, the Women’s Health Protection 
Act, offered by the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia, Ms. CHU, prohibits states like Georgia 
from restricting access to abortion services. 
Georgia has some of the most restrictive abor-
tion laws in the country, but my constituents 
deserve to make their own choices regarding 
their health. 
Lastly, H.R. 5349, the Protect SNAP Act, 
was introduced by the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut, Ms. DELAURO. This bill prohibits the 
administration from limiting access to the Sup-
plemental Nutrition Assistance Program, com-
monly known as food stamps. Last year, the 
administration announced a plan to make 
nearly 700,000 people ineligible for food as-
sistance. We know SNAP is critical to making 
sure that children in the richest country in the 
world have food in their stomachs, and it 
would be doubly irresponsible to deny them 
help during a pandemic and recession. Con-
gress must do all it can to ensure this vital 
program is strengthened and expanded, not 
cut. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent 
the people of Georgia’s 5th Congressional 
District. I believe these bills to be some of the 
critically important measures this body should 
be considering and passing to help the Amer-
ican people through this difficult time.

DEMOCRAT ELECTION THEFT EX-
PERT DESCRIBES HOW HE DOES 
IT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, as an overview, House Speak-
er NANCY PELOSI, without a floor vote, 
has dictated that we wear a mask while 
speaking on the House floor or we will 
be silenced; hence, my mask. 
Madam Speaker, this is my seventh 
speech in a series on voter fraud, elec-
tion theft, and the presidential elec-
tion. 
Today, I continue citing an August 
29, 2020, New York Post expose that re-
veals the sordid underbelly of voter 
fraud and election theft that plague 
American elections.

a Democrat election thief expert’s ‘‘rap

consultant to various campaigns,’’ re-
veals his stunning election theft strat-
egies and view that ‘‘election fraud is 
more the rule than the exception.’’ 
The Democrat election theft expert 
steals elections at nursing homes, stat-
ing: ‘‘Hitting up assisted-living facili-
ties and helping the elderly fill out 
their absentee ballots was a gold mine 
of votes. There are nursing homes 
where the nurse is actually a paid oper-
ative. They literally fill the ballot out 
for them.’’ 
The Democrat election theft expert 
steals elections by exploiting weak 
voter identification laws. 
‘‘The Democrat election theft expert 
would send operatives to vote in poll-
ing stations, particularly in States 
likes New Jersey and New York that do 
not require voter ID.’’ 
b 1215 
The Democrat election expert de-
scribes how he deploys his election 
theft team: 
You fill out these index cards with that 
person’s name and district, and you go 
around the city and say: You are going to be 
him. You are going to be him. 
At the polling place, the fake voter would 
sign in and vote. 
The imposters re-create the signature that 
already appears in the voter roll as best they 
could. In the rare instance that a real voter 
had already signed in and cast a ballot, the 
impersonator would just chalk it up to an in-
nocent mistake and bolt. 
The Democrat election theft expert steals 
elections at homeless shelters, which offer a 
nearly 
inexhaustible 
pool 
of 
reliable— 
buyable—voters. 
Laughing at the roughly $174 per vote Mike 
Bloomberg spent to win his third mayoral 
term, he said he could have delivered the 
same result at a 70 percent discount. 
Madam Speaker, voter fraud and 
election theft increasingly rot at the 
foundation of America’s republic: our 
elections. 
Voting by illegal aliens and other 
noncitizens is rampant and flipping 
elections because socialist Democrats 
have made it illegal to require proof of 
citizenship when illegal aliens and 
other noncitizens demand to be reg-
istered to vote. 
This year, at a minimum, hundreds 
of thousands and, more likely, millions 
of illegal aliens and other noncitizens 
voted after Joe Biden openly promised 
amnesty and citizenship if he is elected 
President. 
Vote-by-mail schemes are both hor-
ribly prone to voter fraud and illegal 
because they violate Article I, Section 
4 of the Constitution and Congress’ en-
suing designation, with minor excep-
tions, of one 24-hour day as the elec-
tion day during which citizens can 
vote. Congress could have but did not 
create an election week, an election 
month, or an election season. 
Madam Speaker, the overwhelming 
and irrefutable evidence compels but 
one conclusion: If only lawful votes 
cast by eligible American citizens are 
counted, then Donald Trump won the 
electoral college. 
In 1776 American patriot Thomas 
Paine said it best: 
These are the times that try men’s souls. 
The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot 
will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of 
their country, but he that stands by it now 
deserves the love and thanks of man and 
woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily con-
quered; yet we have this consolation with us, 
that the harder the conflict, the more glo-
rious the triumph. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all American 
patriots to join the fight for America 
and against dictatorial socialism. Why? 
Because America is worth fighting for. 
As such, on January 6, 2021, provided 
the required one Senator joins me, I 
will move to reject electoral college 
submissions of all States whose elec-
tion systems are so badly flawed as to 
render their vote submissions unreli-
able, untrustworthy, and unworthy of 
acceptance.

TRIBUTE TO PHIL ROE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize my 
friend, PHIL
ROE, Representative of 
Tennessee’s First District, as he choos-
es to end this chapter in his life and re-
turn to being a private citizen. 
On television, many Americans are 
left with the impression that the U.S. 
House of Representatives is a place of 
constant combat. Naturally, over the 
past two centuries, the House has seen 
many great debates about the future of 
our Nation. 
Debate at its essence is about pas-
sionately arguing for your preferred 
course of action. The beauty of the peo-
ple’s House and the reason that former 
Speaker 
Longworth 
described 
the 
House as coming nearer reflecting at 
all time the popular will than does any 
other individual or legislative body in 
this or any other country is that we de-
bate in earnest, yet we do so with a 
premium on civility. But, alas, as I 
say, many Americans are left, based on 
the 
evening 
cable 
entertainment 
shows, with the opposite impression. 
My experience over the past 6 years 
is that this Chamber is, in fact, a place 
where the great issues of the day are 
debated and where, through that work 
and debate, firm friendships are estab-
lished. Those friendships extend across 
the aisle, across cultures, and across 
generations. 
Over the past 6 years, I have come to 
have the greatest respect for one of my 
colleagues who, after 12 years, has 
elected to leave the House and return 
to that most basic title that we all 
hold with honor, that of citizen. 
During the course of these years, I 
recognize my friend, PHIL ROE, Rep-
resentative of Tennessee’s First Dis-
trict, as a man of high character, im-
mense intellect, and great loyalty. His 
loyalty to the people of the Tri-Cities 
of east Tennessee is shown in his daily 
spirit. 
His loyalty, passion, and care for his 
fellow veterans have overflowed in his 
role as chairman of the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee and currently 
as ranking member. He has never for-
gotten his service in the U.S. Army in 
the Medical Corps, where he was sta-
tioned in Korea. 
He has never forgotten his constitu-
ents, who enjoy a livelihood in the 
thriving region in and around Johnson 
City, Tennessee. 
For three decades, prior to coming to 
Congress, PHIL
was an OB/GYN. He 
claims, Madam Speaker, that his ter-
rific record of public service and local 
office, including being mayor of John-
son City, were essential to his prepara-
tion for and success in earning a seat 
in Congress. But we all know better, 
Madam Speaker. We know that simply 
delivering the vast majority of your 
constituents is a surefire way to be 
successfully elected. 
As a Christian, PHIL
sets a high 
standard and is a stalwart in the an-
nual National Prayer Breakfast prepa-
ration and our weekly Thursday morn-
ing bipartisan fellowship, where he 
never hesitates to bring his guitar and 
share his musical talents. There must 
be something in the water in Bristol, 
Tennessee, home of country music. 
It is true that PHIL and I bonded over 
critical national defense policy, ac-
countability and excellence in care for 
our veterans, and his solutions for mar-
ket-based policies that would lead to 
more affordable healthcare for all 
Americans. But we grew up as Scouts, 
so our real mutual love is for the out-
doors. To this day, decades later, we 
share a love of backpacking, camping, 
and hiking in the mountains. 
In fact, in 2019, both of us were so ex-
cited that Congress passed, and Presi-
dent Trump signed into law, new na-
tional wilderness areas in each our dis-
tricts. For me, I was able to add acre-
age to Flatside Wilderness and com-
mence a formal study of the area. For 
PHIL, it was adding nearly 20,000 acres 
of some of the wildest pockets of Cher-
okee National Forest in east Tennessee 
to the wilderness system. 
We both share an amazing affection 
for that long day at high-altitude 
above the treeline. One evening in 
Maine, after a delicious dinner, we 
agreed, hey, let’s get up in the morning 
and go climb the highest mountain on 
the eastern seaboard and hike the end 
of the Appalachian Trail. We will climb 
and retrace the steps of Henry David 
Thoreau’s attempt to climb Mount Ka-
tahdin. 
Sure enough, we were true to our 
word. We got up at 3 a.m. and drove 
from the coast to the trailhead, arriv-
ing at 7 a.m. We spent one of the most 
memorable days on the trail that I can 
recall. The summit of Mount Katahdin 
was pea soup, but you can tell from our 
smiles that the long trek up and down 
was worth every step. 
Congressman ROE, you have fought 
the good fight. You have kept the 
faith. And like every good Scout, you 
have left your campsite cleaner than 
when you found it. Now it is time for a 
few less cross fires and a few more late- 
night campfires.

families many, many happy days on

RECOGNIZING PAUL KRATZ ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a faithful public 
servant who served the city of Omaha 
for nearly 23 years. 
Paul Kratz, who led the city’s legal 
department as the city attorney, re-
tired last week to spend his days with 
his wife of 47 years, Diane. He is also a 
wonderful friend of mine. 
A 1975 graduate of the University of 
Nebraska College of Law, Paul oversaw 
a staff of 35, including 24 attorneys, 
and negotiated redevelopment agree-
ments and managed litigation. Origi-
nally hired by former Mayor Hal Daub, 
also a former Congressman here, he 
served during the administrations of 
Mayor Mike Fahey, Mayor Jim Suttle, 
and current Mayor Jean Stothert. 
Mayor Stothert had this to say about 
Mr. Kratz: 
Paul has been an important adviser, nego-
tiator, and taxpayer advocate for more than 
two decades. He has guided mayors and city 
councils to make decisions that make 
Omaha the great and growing city it is 
today. 
Former Mayor Suttle said this about 
him: 
During my time as mayor, Paul Kratz al-
ways told me what I needed to hear, not nec-
essarily what I wanted to hear. Out of this 
foundation came a strong relationship built 
on trust and honesty. In addition, it made 
me a better mayor and a better leader, espe-
cially as we led the city through the two 
major tragedies of a potential bankruptcy 
and the devastating 2011 Missouri River 
flood. 
Former Mayor Daub said this: 
Paul Kratz brought unique skills and a 
love of public service to Omaha city govern-
ment. Always the gentleman, his calm and 
pleasant demeanor provided stability in his 
well-managed office and earns broad agree-
ment of admiring his objectivity and wise 
advice. He understood and appreciated the 
political ramifications of legal advice, the 
value of compromise, and his insights and 
creative recommendations to a multitude of 
tough issues were always helpful. His talent 
and tenacity in public service is rare, and he 
will leave very large shoes to fill. 
Paul Kratz may have been the man 
behind the curtain in negotiations, but 
his legacy will remain because of doz-
ens of projects, including the CHI 
Health Center, the Bob Kerrey Pedes-
trian Bridge, the TD Ameritrade Park, 
and the College World Series contract. 
In addition, the legacy of service of 
the Kratz family continues with his 
children. His youngest son, Gregory 
Kratz, practices law in Fairbury, Ne-
braska, and also serves as an officer in 
the Nebraska Air National Guard. Jeff 
Kratz, his oldest son, serves as my leg-
islative director and has worked for 
many years serving the needs of Ne-
braska taxpayers. 
Paul Kratz’s dedication to Nebraska 
has touched countless lives, and his 
positive example has surely inspired 
another generation of his family to 
carry his torch for many years to 
come. 
We thank him for his dedicated serv-
ice to our city and wish him the best in 
future endeavors. 
RECOGNIZING STEVE NELSON ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Steve Nelson, a 
man who has been at the forefront of 
Nebraska’s booming agriculture indus-
try and who retired on December 8 of 
this year as the president of the Ne-
braska Farm Bureau, a position he has 
faithfully served since 2011. 
A farmer his whole life, Steve has 
produced irrigated corn, hybrid seed 
corn, and soybeans at his farm near 
Axtell in south central Nebraska. 
In his work with the Farm Bureau, 
both before and during his tenure as 
president, Steve has helped to secure 
farm bills and worked to reform and 
lower taxes to help protect farm and 
ranch families. 
He has also fought to bolster animal 
agriculture against those who want to 
end it and sought initiatives to grow 
Nebraska’s livestock industry. 
While Texas and Nebraska may have 
had a rivalry on the football field, they 
also have held a rivalry in livestock. 
During Steve’s time as president, Ne-
braska was ranked first for several 
years in commercial red meat produc-
tion. 
Steve has also advocated for Nebras-
ka’s agriculture industry to other 
countries, 
serving 
as 
a 
delegation 
member to Denmark, Japan, South 
Korea, Belgium, and many others. 
I am sure his wife, Elma, a retired 
nurse, is looking forward to spending 
more time with her husband and is 
proud of the work he has done, as are 
his kids: Scott and his wife, Amy, who 
farm with Steve; and their daughter, 
Stacy, and her husband, Bobby, who 
live in Ashland. Sadly, their daughter, 
Sarah, passed away unexpectedly in 
2006. Of course, his four grandchildren, 
I am sure, will spend more time with 
grandpa on the farm. 
I thank Steve for advocating and bol-
stering Nebraska’s agriculture indus-
try. I thank him for his friendship and 
his counsel. 
Madam Speaker, I wish Steve the 
best on his retirement from the bureau. 
f 
FAREWELL TO PHIL ROE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize a friend and colleague who will be 
retiring from Congress as the 116th 
Congress comes to a close. I have 
served with Dr. PHIL
ROE
since we 
came into Congress together as class-
mates in 2009. 
PHIL represents the First Congres-
sional District of Tennessee. His path-
way to Congress includes being an 
Eagle Scout, veteran, mayor, and med-
ical physician, delivering more than 
5,000 of his future constituents. 
PHIL and I have sat next to each 
other on the House Education and 
Labor Committee for 12 years. We 
started at the very end of the seniority 
seating and now sit prominently as 
senior members. 
b 1230 
Congressman ROE has left his mark 
serving the American people as chair 
and Republican leader of the House 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. He au-
thored the MISSION Act, which en-
sures veterans have the ability to re-
ceive the best possible care now and in 
the future, and the Forever GI Bill, 
which ensures veterans won’t lose ac-
cess to the education benefits that 
they earned through their service. 
Madam Chair, in his own words, Con-
gressman PHIL ROE said it best: ‘‘I’ll 
leave Congress at the end of the year 
knowing that our Nation’s heroes are 
better served today because of our 
work.’’ 
Thank you, PHIL. And thank you to 
his wife, Clarinda, and their family for 
sharing PHIL with us. Best wishes for 
whatever the next chapter’s adventures 
bring. 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESSMAN GREG WALDEN 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, in 2018, Congressman 
GREG WALDEN won his 11th term in 
Congress to represent Oregon’s Second 
Congressional District. When the 116th 
Congress ends, he will retire after 22 
years of service to our Nation. 
GREG graduated from the University 
of Oregon with a journalism degree and 
took over the operations of his father’s 
radio station in Hood River—and added 
another—before winning his congres-
sional seat in 1998. 
In 2014 and 2016, he successfully 
chaired the National Republican Con-
gressional Committee. GREG served as 
chairman of the House Committee on 
Energy and Commerce in the 115th 
Congress and currently serves as the 
Republican leader of the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to 
have worked with Congressman GREG 
WALDEN and share passions with him: 
his passion to improve forest manage-
ment and lead reforms to make our 
Federal forests healthier, make our 
rural communities more financially 
solvent, and make our forests more re-
silient to climate change. 
To his wife, Mylene, thank you for 
sharing this lifelong Oregonian, Eagle 
Scout, and great public servant with 
us.

December 16, 2020 
Best wishes, GREG. I know you will 
continue to make a difference in retire-
ment. 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESSMAN ROB BISHOP 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize a 
retiring leader and mentor, Congress-
man ROB BISHOP. 
A public schoolteacher turned public 
servant, ROB BISHOP represents Utah’s 
First Congressional District in the 
United States Congress. I have had the 
privilege of serving with and under the 
leadership of Congressman BISHOP on 
the Committee on Natural Resources 
for 8 years. 
First elected in 2003, ROB served as 
chairman of the powerful House Com-
mittee on Natural Resources and is 
now its ranking member. He has been a 
key player on many public land bills. 
Congressman BISHOP is committed to 
helping Congress strike a balance for 
wise management of our public lands 
and resources. Protecting private prop-
erty rights and State sovereignty and 
preserving the Western heritage are 
among his chief priorities on the com-
mittees that guided him. There is no 
stronger fighter to protect the liveli-
hoods of public land users in rural 
America, while ensuring that we are 
responsible stewards of our natural re-
sources. 
Madam Speaker, Congressman ROB 
BISHOP negotiated much of the legisla-
tion included in the Natural Resources 
Management Act. This legislation ex-
panded access to public lands, while 
also shrinking the size of the Federal 
estate, and provided wins for America’s 
sportsmen, hunters, and fishermen. 
Thank you, ROB, for your service, 
your friendship, and your mentoring. 
Thank you, as well to his wife, 
Jeralynn, and his children and grand-
children for sharing ROB with us. 
Best wishes in the next chapter of 
life. 
f 
HONORING DR. FRED MULLINS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor a highly esteemed surgeon, com-
passionate physician, hero, and an in-
credible person. 
Dr. Fred Mullins, who was president 
and CEO of the Burn and Reconstruc-
tive Centers of America, sadly, passed 
away at the age of 54. In his over 30 
years of caring for thousands of pa-
tients, he was a trailblazer in burn care 
across the Nation and the world. 
Dr. Mullins was also a founding board 
member of the Georgia Trauma Foun-
dation, a member of the Georgia Trau-
ma Commission, and chairman of the 
JMS Research Foundation. He was a 
native Augustan and graduated from 
Augusta College before attending the 
Medical College of Georgia. 
Dr. Mullins was given a foundation 
for his skills in burn care by Dr. Joseph 
M. Still, and his focus was on carrying 
Dr. Still’s legacy to provide the best 
possible care to patients. 
I became acquainted with Dr. Mullins 
in February of 2008, after the explosion 
of the Savannah Sugar Refinery in my 
hometown of Port Wentworth. A num-
ber of the victims there were taken to 
the Augusta Burn Center; and there, I 
witnessed Dr. Mullins’ compassion, his 
concern, and his care for patients. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
because 
of 
Dr. 
Mullins’ unrivaled work and care for 
patients, he now leaves behind a legacy 
that represents dedication to the well- 
being 
of 
patients 
and 
improving 
healthcare 
across 
the 
Nation 
and 
world. 
Madam Speaker, my thoughts and 
prayers go out to his family, his 
friends, his patients, and all who knew 
him. 
REMEMBERING HARRISON DEAL 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor Statesboro native Harrison Deal, 
who, tragically, passed away on Fri-
day, December 4, from a fatal car cash 
in Pooler, Georgia. 
Harrison was a 20-year-old student at 
the University of Georgia and was ex-
pected to graduate in 2022. He was a 
former intern for Senator PERDUE, and 
worked in the Athens office for Senator 
KELLY LOEFFLER’s campaign. 
Governor Brian Kemp stated Har-
rison was a member of the ‘‘Kemp 
Strong’’ family, and was a Kemp son 
and brother they never had. He has 
been described as an incredible, mag-
nificent young man by Senator PERDUE 
and Senator LOEFFLER. 
He clearly touched countless lives in 
the State of Georgia and beyond. 
Madam Speaker, Harrison was the 
son of Bulloch County Commissioner 
Curt Deal and his wife, Jenni, and was 
the brother of Hannah and Halli Deal. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to 
the Deal family, Harrison’s friends, and 
all who knew him during this most dif-
ficult time. 
RECOGNIZING MARCUS HILL 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor and con-
gratulate a great American. Marcus 
Hill retires from serving as a senior ex-
ecutive adviser for the Federal Law En-
forcement Training Centers, or FLETC, 
on January 28, 2021. 
Marcus began his career of service as 
a 
personnel 
management 
specialist 
with the Department of the Navy in 
1983 and was assigned to the naval sub-
marine base located in Kings Bay, 
Georgia. This position further inspired 
him to a life of service, so he went on 
to serve an Active-Duty tour in the 
United States Air Force. 
Before he transferred to FLETC in 
1999, Marcus served in several leader-
ship assignments within the Navy. His 
career in FLETC spanned widely and 
included joining the Transportation 
Security Administration, or TSA, after 
the tragic events of 9/11. 
Marcus’ life has been marked by dis-
tinguished commitment to serving his 
country and fellow man, which is why 
he has received numerous awards and 
honors, to include the 2017 Presidential 
Rank Award for Meritorious Service 
among many others. 
It is people like Marcus who inspire 
us to live for something greater than 
ourselves, and I am thankful for the 
wonderful example he has set, which 
will surely outlast his career for count-
less years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I wish him and his 
family the best as he embarks on his 
retirement. 
f 
NO VOTER FRAUD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JEFFRIES) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to condemn the treacherous 
and seditious behavior of some in this 
Nation who continue to poison the in-
tegrity of our democracy. 
The voters have spoken. The re-
counts have spoken. The electoral col-
lege has spoken. Joe Biden will be the 
46th President of the United States of 
America. Over 80 million people voted 
for Joe Biden—more than any other 
Presidential candidate in American 
history. 
Joe Biden won blue States, like New 
York and California. 
Joe Biden won swing States like 
Michigan, 
Pennsylvania, 
and 
Wis-
consin. 
Joe Biden won red States, like Geor-
gia and Arizona. 
Joe Biden is the next President of the 
United States of America. 
And yet there are some in this coun-
try who continue to peddle wild con-
spiracy theories without a shred of evi-
dence: 
The Republican Governor of Georgia 
found no evidence of voter fraud. 
The Republican Governor of Ari-
zona—no evidence of voter fraud. 
The Republican-led FBI found no evi-
dence of voter fraud. 
The Republican-led Department of 
Justice found no evidence of voter 
fraud. 
Republican-appointed 
judges 
throughout the country have found no 
evidence of voter fraud. 
The Republican Attorney General, 
Bill Barr, found no evidence of voter 
fraud. 
The Supreme Court, with six Repub-
lican-appointed Justices dismissed the 
baseless lawsuit that contained not a 
shred of evidence of voter fraud. 
Madam Speaker, Joe Biden was duly- 
elected as the next President of the 
United States of America, and yet 
there are some in this Nation who are 
behaving like members of the Jefferson 
Davis Caucus, including a former Mem-
ber of this Chamber, who suggested 
that Texas secede. 
Madam Speaker, it is time to respect 
the Constitution. 
It is time to respect our democracy. 
It is time to respect the voters. 
It is time to respect the rule of law. 
It is time to respect the peaceful 
transfer of power.

Gracious God, thank You for giving

As we near the end of a long and dif-

emerge. The long and difficult work of 
compromise and problem-solving has 
been encouraging. Continue to inspire 
the men and women of Congress to 
work together to fashion bills to fund 
the government and offer assistance to 
those who find themselves on the edge 
of economic disaster. 
Bless as well those who, in great 
hope, deliver vaccines to the men and 
women who have been on the front line 
of the battle against the plague of 
COVID–19. May their work continue in 
good and improving health. Comfort 
those who have suffered the loss of

May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF DICK 
HINCH, SPEAKER OF NEW HAMP-
SHIRE HOUSE 
(Mr. PAPPAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to remember the life and legacy of 
State Representative Dick Hinch, the 
speaker of the New Hampshire House. I 
was deeply saddened last week when I 
learned of the sudden passing of Speak-
er Hinch. He was yet another American 
we have lost due to COVID–19. 
Dick was a dedicated elected official 
for the people of Merrimack, the town 
he represented at the State house for 
six terms. Just a week before his pass-
ing on December 2, Dick was sworn in 
as the new speaker of the New Hamp-
shire House, a role he considered to be 
the honor of his life. 
I saw him on election day, when he 
warmly greeted me at his polling place 
just like everyone else coming to vote. 
It didn’t matter that I was a Democrat 
and he was a Republican. He knew that 
public service was a higher calling, and 
he treated everyone with the utmost 
respect. 
Dick was a happy warrior and em-
bodied the spirit of New Hampshire’s 
citizen legislature. We are better off 
because of his decades of work on be-
half of the people of Merrimack and 
New Hampshire. 
My thoughts are with his wife, Pat, 
and their children, as well as his fam-
ily, friends, and colleagues, during this 
difficult time. May he rest in peace.

REMEMBERING PATROLMAN 
TYLER HERNDON 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Pa-
trolman Tyler Herndon of Kings Moun-
tain, North Carolina, who passed away 
on December 11 in the line of duty. 
He was a dedicated public servant, 
and many who knew him knew that he 
loved his job and his community im-
mensely. 
To his father, Mark; mother, Debbie; 
sister, Lindsey; and girlfriend, Holly, 
Tyler was someone who always put a 
smile on people’s faces. 
Tyler always wanted to be in law en-
forcement. After he received his bach-
elor’s degree in criminal justice from 
UNC-Charlotte, he went on to pursue 
his dream. 
May God bless Tyler’s family and the 
many brave men and women serving 
with the Mount Holly Police Depart-
ment.

WE MUST WORK TOGETHER 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to exhort all of us in this Chamber 
to work together. 
I know there are those of us in this 
Chamber for whom the spending of one 
Federal dollar is a physically painful 
event, but now is not the time to be 
deficit hawks. Now is the time for us to 
come together. 
The United States of America is 
more than the sum of its parts. In 
times of great danger to our Nation, we 
come together, and the Federal Gov-
ernment leads the way. We did it when 
we defeated fascism in Europe and 
Asia. We did it when we rebuilt Europe 
and Asia to become great allies and 
peaceful and productive partners. 
We can do it again. We have a ter-
rible enemy right now in the COVID 
virus. It is wrecking our economy, and 
it is killing our people. We have lost 
more than 300,000 people, more than 
our combat losses in World War II. 
Let’s 
work 
together 
for 
robust 
COVID relief for our economy. Let’s 
get it done, Mr. Speaker.

CONGRATULATING PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ON VACCINE SUCCESS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, The Washington Times edi-
torial board is appreciated for pub-
lishing ‘‘Joy, and Vaccines to the 
World,’’ where they praised President 
Donald Trump for his efforts to bring a 
vaccine to the United States faster 
than any other vaccine in history. 
The article is explaining: 
The lifesaving COVID–19 vaccine that 
President Trump promised to deliver has ar-
rived in record time. Hallelujah. 
On Friday, the Food and Drug Administra-
tion concluded its review of the front-run-
ning vaccine developed and gave a green 
light for distribution. Initial shipments are 
expected to reach all 636 locations across the 
50 States by today. 
‘‘Promises made, promises kept,’’ Mr. 
Trump likes to say. That is the can-do spirit 
that makes America special. Just in time for 
Christmas, the fruits of Operation Warp 
Speed are starting to bring joy to the world. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Our family’s sympathy for the death 
of former DNC Chairman Don Fowler.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7168 
December 16, 2020 
SURVIVAL CHECKS FOR MIXED- 
STATUS FAMILIES 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
we are close to finalizing a relief pack-
age, but I ask my colleagues: Relief for 
whom? 
A relief package without survival 
checks is not a relief package at all, 
nor is a relief package that leaves out 
millions of immigrants and their fami-
lies. Any deal that we strike must in-
clude survival checks to families and 
immigrants, and mixed-status families 
must be included. 
Earlier this year, countless families 
that I represent were denied stimulus 
checks, including U.S. citizens whose 
spouses are immigrants. We even ex-
cluded children who may have an im-
migrant parent. 
How in the world did we exclude U.S. 
citizen children? 
In this season of sacred holidays, I 
implore all of us to be compassionate 
and not punish kids for their parents’ 
status. Families are struggling to put 
food on their tables and keep roofs over 
their heads. 
Circumstances are dire. We need to 
put money directly into working fami-
lies’ pockets. I urge my colleagues that 
any relief package must include sur-
vival checks for everyone, including 
immigrant children. 
f 
HONORING THOSE WHO HONOR 
OUR VETERANS 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Johnny Isakson 
and DAVID
P. ROE, M.D. Veterans 
Health Care and Benefits Improvement 
Act of 2020, a bipartisan legislative 
package that includes two bills that I 
have proudly introduced this Congress, 
the VET TEC Expansion Act and the 
Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act of 
2020. 
Since coming to Congress in 2007, one 
of my most important priorities in this 
Chamber has been to protect and im-
prove the benefits that our Nation’s 
veterans have earned and deserve. I in-
troduced the VET TEC Expansion Act 
and the Reducing Veteran Homeless-
ness Act earlier this Congress in re-
sponse to comments and feedback I re-
ceived from veterans and veterans or-
ganizations throughout my district and 
across the country. 
Both pieces of legislation seek to 
build upon existing veterans benefits 
programs, including the VET TEC pilot 
program and the HUD–VA Supportive 
Housing Program, by expanding and 
streamlining them for veterans and 
veterans service providers who utilize 
them. 
The VET TEC Expansion Act will 
continue to ensure that our heroes can 
enhance skills they developed in the 
military when returning to private life 
by providing access to nontraditional 
and 
technology-oriented 
courses 
through the VET TEC pilot program. 
This bill would expand VET TEC to in-
clude part-time courses and permit ad-
ditional course providers into the VET 
TEC pilot program. 
I am also pleased that H.R. 7105, like 
the initial House-passed version of this 
bill, would increase the VET TEC fund-
ing authorization by $30 million per 
year through 2023 to help the VA meet 
demand for this popular program with 
our veterans. 
In addition, no veteran in my district 
or anywhere in the country should be 
homeless due to unnecessary VA staff-
ing vacancies. The Reducing Veteran 
Homelessness Act would require that 
the VA contract out any consistently 
vacant HUD-VA Supportive Housing 
case management positions to commu-
nity experts so that unused housing 
vouchers can be matched with home-
less veterans who need them the most. 
Finally, I want to take a moment to 
thank Dr. ROE for his unwavering com-
mitment to our Nation’s veterans 
throughout his time in this Congress, 
specifically as chairman and ranking 
member of the House Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee over the course of the past 
4 years and for his own personal service 
to the United States Army, serving in 
Korea. 
His strong leadership on behalf of our 
fellow veterans has been unwavering 
since he came to Congress, and his te-
nacity, knowledge, and friendship will 
be missed in this Chamber after he re-
tires from Congress. 
On behalf of a very grateful Nation, 
we thank Dr. ROE
for his servant’s 
heart, for putting the veterans first, 
and for improving the quality of the 
care for them. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to join me in 
supporting this bipartisan bill and 
thanking Congressman ROE
for his 
service.

HOPE AND DESPAIR IN CENTRAL 
FLORIDA 
(Mr. SOTO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, there is a 
mix of hope and despair in central 
Florida. 
This week, the first vaccines arrived 
to help protect our healthcare profes-
sionals. But unemployment remains 
around 10 percent; food banks lay bare; 
many 
are 
behind 
on 
rent; 
and 
coronavirus cases continue to rise. 
The message is clear in both Florida 
and across our Nation: Americans need 
help. 
It is time for this Congress to come 
together 
and 
pass 
meaningful 
coronavirus emergency relief to defeat 
the virus; to help small businesses and 
the unemployed; and to ensure food, 
housing, and direct stimulus checks for 
our constituents. 
The solution is within our grasp. We 
just need to come together this week 
to get the job done. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues: Don’t be an Ebenezer Scrooge. 
Embrace the Christmas spirit. Join me 
and vote ‘‘yes.’’

RECOGNIZING MIKE VUCKOVICH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give a spe-
cial shout-out to Mike Vuckovich, su-
perintendent 
of 
the 
Indiana 
Area 
School District. 
Mike was recently recognized as one 
of America’s Superintendents to Watch 
for 2020. He was one of only 24 recipi-
ents to receive this recognition and the 
only Pennsylvanian. 
Mike has been on the job just 2 years 
but recently was recognized by the Na-
tional School Public Relations Asso-
ciation as a 2020 Superintendent to 
Watch. The organization selects super-
intendents from across the country 
who ‘‘demonstrate dynamic, fast-paced 
leadership with strong communication 
at its core.’’ 
This is exactly what Mike has done 
with his time at Indiana Area School 
District. 
Mike has been a champion for digital 
technology and online communication 
throughout the district, investments 
that have clearly come in handy in the 
age of coronavirus. The district’s new 
website and social media accounts have 
been a useful tool to keep parents, 
teachers, and students on the same 
page during what has undoubtedly been 
a hectic and stressful school year. 
I thank Mike for his drive, dedica-
tion, and initiative, and I am pleased 
to have a leader like Mike in Indiana 
County.

EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF SANDY 
HOOK ELEMENTARY SHOOTING 
(Mrs. HAYES asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in remembrance of the 26 beau-
tiful lives that were lost on December 
14, 2012, at Sandy Hook Elementary 
School. 
Mr. Speaker, 8 years ago, 20 innocent 
children and six selfless educators were 
murdered in what should have been the 
safest places in their community: their 
school. 
Today, I ask that we pause, reflect, 
remember, and recommit ourselves to 
working to ensure that this never hap-
pens again. 
For many residents of Newtown, Con-
necticut, 8 years feels like yesterday. 
Time has stood still for so many fami-
lies as they attempt to rebuild their

community and honor the precious 
memory of their children and edu-
cators. 
Mr. Speaker, much needs to be done 
to ensure that our schools and commu-
nities are safe places. We owe it to the 
26 families from Sandy Hook to work 
together to make this happen. We owe 
it to the over 38,000 people who will die 
each year from gun violence to do bet-
ter. We owe it to the 50 million people 
who are affected by mental health 
challenges each year. We owe it to our-
selves, because we are capable of cre-
ating change. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we honor, re-
member, and reflect, and then we get 
back to work.

IN RECOGNITION OF DAWN BAKER 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Savannah, 
Georgia, WTOC news anchor Dawn 
Baker for appearing in this year’s 
‘‘CNN Heroes’’ special. In the special, 
she was recognized as the first person 
to participate in phase 3 of the COVID– 
19 vaccine trial in the U.S. 
Local news anchors have thousands 
of viewers, so they have a great respon-
sibility to serve as positive leaders in 
their community. By demonstrating 
the importance and safety of the 
coronavirus vaccine, which is now 
being distributed across the country, 
Dawn has exemplified the qualities of a 
true leader. 
However, this is not the first time 
Dawn has been a hero. Throughout her 
career in journalism, she has blessed 
countless lives through her dedication 
to improving her community and the 
State of Georgia. 
Mr. Speaker, I take this time to 
thank all heroes like Dawn Baker for 
stepping up to the plate during an un-
precedented time and demonstrating 
commitment to a better, healthier 
America.

aware of a final judgment by a Federal agency 
against an educational institution or owner of 
an educational institution pertaining to sub-
stantial misrepresentation described in sub-
section (b) or of other credible evidence relating

partnership with the applicable State approving

stitution or owner that it is at risk of losing ap-
proval under this chapter of its courses or pro-
grams of education; 
‘‘(2) provide the educational institution or 
owner 60 days to provide any information it

final determinations under paragraph (1).

which the Under Secretary shall provide to the 
educational institution or owner within such 
period after making the preliminary finding as 
the Under Secretary shall establish for purposes 
of this clause, except that, in every case, such 
period shall end before the date on which the 
Under Secretary makes a final determination 
under such paragraph; and 
‘‘(iv) include— 
‘‘(I) a process for receipt of findings from a 
third-party pertinent to this section; and 
‘‘(II) a process for an educational institution 
or an owner to provide such information as the 
educational institution or owner determines ap-
propriate to the Secretary, including informa-
tion about corrective actions the educational in-
stitution or owner may have taken in response 
to preliminary findings under paragraph (1). 
‘‘(C) The process established under subpara-
graph (A) shall not prohibit a State approving 
agency from— 
‘‘(i) independently investigating a potential 
violation of subsection (a), (c), or (d); or 
‘‘(ii) taking action if the State approving 
agency finds a violation of subsection (a), (c), or 
(d). 
‘‘(3) Upon a preliminary finding under this 
subsection of a violation of subsection (a), (c), 
or (d) by an educational institution, or the 
owner of an educational institution, the Under 
Secretary shall require the educational institu-
tion or owner to submit to the Under Secretary 
a report prepared by an approved third-party 
auditor of the advertising and enrollment prac-
tices of the educational institution or owner. 
‘‘(4)(A) Before making a final determination 
under this subsection regarding a violation of 
subsection (a), (c), or (d) by an educational in-
stitution or owner of an educational institution,

stitution or owner that pertain to activities and 
practices covered by subsections (a), (c), and 
(d); 
‘‘(ii) consider the results of a risk-based sur-
vey conducted by a State approving agency, if 
available; and 
‘‘(iii) review— 
‘‘(I) the findings and information received 
pursuant to the processes established under

‘‘(II) in a case in which a report was sub-
mitted under subsection (f)(3), such report; 
‘‘(III) the report submitted under paragraph 
(3)(B) of this subsection; 
‘‘(IV) any findings and results submitted 
under subsection (e)(3); 
‘‘(V) the marketing and outreach material of 
the educational institution and the contractors 
of the educational institution.

final determination under this subsection solely 
based on preliminary findings. 
‘‘(5) The Under Secretary may not delegate 
authority to make a final determination under 
this subsection, including to any employee of

sion.

termination by the Under Secretary for Benefits 
under subsection (g) that an educational insti-
tution or the owner of an educational institu-
tion violated subsection (a), (c), or (d), the 
Under Secretary shall, but subject to subpara-
graphs (B), (C), and (D) of this paragraph, take 
one of the following actions independent of any 
actions taken under section 3690 of this title: 
‘‘(i) Publish a caution flag on the GI Bill 
Comparison Tool, or successor tool, about that 
educational institution and alert its currently 
enrolled eligible veterans and eligible persons. 
‘‘(ii) Suspend the approval of the courses and 
programs of education offered by the edu-
cational institution by disapproving new enroll-
ments of eligible veterans and eligible persons in 
each course or program of education offered by 
that educational institution. 
‘‘(iii) Revoke the approval of the courses and 
programs of education offered by the edu-
cational institution by disapproving all enroll-
ments of eligible veterans and eligible persons in 
each course or program of education offered by 
that educational institution. 
‘‘(B) In deciding upon a course of action 
under subparagraph (A), for the first violation 
of this section, the Secretary shall consider the 
factors set forth in paragraph (2). 
‘‘(C) Subject to subsection (i), any repeat vio-
lation and final finding within five years of the 
first violation of this section shall result in— 
‘‘(i) a suspension of approval of new enroll-
ments as described in subparagraph (A)(ii) of 
this paragraph until reinstatement under sub-
section (j); or 
‘‘(ii) a revocation of approval under this 
chapter as described in subparagraph (A)(iii) of 
this paragraph until reinstatement under sub-
section (j). 
‘‘(D) Subject to subsection (i), any third viola-
tion within three years of the second violation 
of this section shall result in revocation of ap-
proval under this chapter as described in sub-
paragraph (A)(iii) of this paragraph until rein-
statement under subsection (j). 
‘‘(E) Any action taken under subparagraph 
(A) of this paragraph regarding a violation of 
subsection (a), (c), or (d) by an educational in-
stitution or the owner of an educational institu-
tion shall be taken on or before the date that is 
180 days after the date on which the Under Sec-
retary provided notice to the educational insti-
tution or owner regarding the violation in ac-
cordance with the process established under 
subsection (g)(2)(B)(iii). 
‘‘(2) The factors set forth in this paragraph 
are the following: 
‘‘(A) That the Secretary’s action brings suffi-
cient deterrence for future fraud against stu-
dents and the programs of education carried out 
under this title. Fraud against veterans must be 
met with a repercussion strong enough to send 
a deterrent message to this and other edu-
cational institutions and owners. 
‘‘(B) That the educational institution has se-
cured an approved third-party auditor to verify 
the educational institution’s, or owner’s, adver-
tising and enrollment practices for at least three 
years going forward. 
‘‘(C) That the educational institution or 
owner has repudiated the deceptive practices 
and has communicated to all employees that de-
ceptive practices will not be tolerated, and has 
instituted strong governance procedures to pre-
vent recurrence. 
‘‘(D) That the educational institution has 
taken steps to remove any pressure on its enroll-
ment recruiters, including by removing enroll-
ment quotas and incentives for enrollment. 
‘‘(E) That the State approving agency or the 
Secretary acting in the role of the State approv-
ing agency, has completed a risk-based survey 
and determined the educational institution is 
worthy of serving eligible veterans and eligible 
persons. 
‘‘(3) Enforcement action under this section 
shall not preclude enforcement action under sec-
tion 3690 of this title. 
‘‘(4) No action may be carried out under this 
subsection with respect to a final determination 
by the Under Secretary under subsection (g) 
while such final determination is pending re-
view under subsection (i). 
‘‘(i) APPEALS.—(1) The Secretary shall estab-
lish a process by which an educational institu-
tion or the owner of an educational institution 
that is the subject of more than one final deter-
mination by the Under Secretary under sub-
section (g)(1) that the educational institution or 
owner violated subsection (a), may request a re-
view of the most recent final determination. 
‘‘(2)(A) The Secretary shall— 
‘‘(i) review each final determination for which 
a review is requested under paragraph (1); and 
‘‘(ii) pursuant to such review, issue a final de-
cision sustaining, modifying, or overturning the 
final determination. 
‘‘(B) The Secretary may not delegate any de-
cision under subparagraph (A). 
‘‘(C)(i) Review under subparagraph (A)(i) of 
this paragraph shall be the exclusive avenue for 
review of a final determination under subsection 
(g)(1). 
‘‘(ii) A decision issued pursuant to a review 
under subparagraph (A)(i) may not be appealed 
to the Secretary for review under section 7104(a) 
of this title. 
‘‘(3)(A) Not later than 30 days after the date 
on which the Secretary issues a final decision 
under paragraph (2)(A)(ii), the Secretary shall 
submit to Congress a report on such final deci-
sion. 
‘‘(B) A report submitted under subparagraph 
(A) shall include the following: 
‘‘(i) An outline of the decisionmaking process 
of the Secretary that led to the final decision de-
scribed in subparagraph (A).

cational assistance to that individual under the 
laws administered by the Secretary as if such 
negative effects did not occur. The authority

provided under section 1 of Public Law 116–128 
(38 U.S.C. 3001 note prec.), but in no case may 
the Secretary provide more than a total of four 
weeks of additional educational assistance by 
reason of section 4 of the Student Veteran

(b) HOUSING AND ALLOWANCES.—In providing 
educational assistance to an individual pursu-
ant to subsection (a), the Secretary may— 
(1) continue to pay a monthly housing stipend 
under chapter 33 of title 38, United States Code, 
during a month the individual would have been 
enrolled in a program of education or training 
but for the COVID–19 emergency at the same 
rate such stipend would have been payable if 
the individual had not been negatively affected 
by the COVID–19 emergency, except that the 
total number of weeks for which stipends may 
continue to be so payable may not exceed four 
weeks; and 
(2) continue to pay payments or subsistence 
allowances under chapters 30, 31, 32, 33, and 35

tablishment certifies to the Secretary that such 
program or training is truncated, delayed, relo-
cated, canceled, partially canceled, converted 
from being on-site to being offered by distance

available by reason of the COVID–19 emergency;

tion to such program or training specified under

cational assistance (including with respect to 
monthly housing stipends, payments, or subsist-
ence allowances) that would be payable to the 
individual but for the COVID–19 emergency.

Secretary determines that an individual who re-
ceived assistance under this section did not 
make progress toward the completion of the pro-
gram of education in which the individual is en-
rolled during the period for which the indi-
vidual received such assistance, any assistance 
provided pursuant to this section shall not be

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
7105, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7105, as amended, the Johnny Isakson 
and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans 
Health Care and Benefits Improvement 
Act of 2020. 
H.R. 7105, as amended, was intro-
duced by Representative MIKE LEVIN, 
chairman of the Subcommittee on Eco-
nomic Opportunity, and the bill before 
us today contains several crucial im-
provements that will better the lives of 
veterans during the COVID–19 pan-
demic and beyond. 
Mr. Speaker, the first title of this 
bill contains legislation from Rep-
resentatives 
LEVIN, 
UNDERWOOD, 
SABLAN, BROWNLEY, WEXTON, and LEE 
to improve the Forever GI Bill. These 
provisions will ensure that institutions 
of higher learning are more account-
able to student veterans. 
These provisions will improve over-
sight of colleges and universities, pro-
vide more flexibility for veterans to 
use their benefits, and improve infor-
mation sharing with students so that 
they can make a more informed deci-
sion on where to continue their edu-
cation. 
Further, building off my Student 
Veterans Coronavirus Response Act 
from earlier in the year, this legisla-
tion includes immediate COVID–19-re-
lated 
relief, 
from 
Representative 
CUNNINGHAM, to student veterans. His 
legislation will extend housing benefits 
to student veterans, provide more flexi-
bility when using their education bene-
fits during the pandemic, and mod-
ernize 
apprenticeship 
programs 
to 
allow them to continue effectively dur-
ing COVID–19. 
Mr. Speaker, to better serve those 
veterans who are experiencing home-
lessness, this legislation includes con-
tributions from Representatives PA-
NETTA, PETERS, WILD, BEATTY, and 
BROWNLEY
to provide more veterans 
with access to the HUD-VASH pro-
gram, including veterans with children 
and women veterans, and to provide 
legal services to homeless veterans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7205 
December 16, 2020 
Recognition of service and sacrifice 
is a priority of mine, and I thank Rep-
resentative COX for his bill that awards 
benefits 
to 
military 
advisers 
who 
served in Vietnam immediately prior 
to the Vietnam war. This group of ad-
visers faced hostilities in the years pre-
ceding the formal declaration of war in 
Vietnam, and some lost their lives. The 
Military Assistance Advisory Group 
will now have greater access to certain 
wartime benefits. 
Mr. Speaker, similarly, this legisla-
tion expands benefits for certain vet-
erans, including Medal of Honor recipi-
ents. Thanks to Representative LAMB’s 
legislation, those veterans and their 
survivors will now receive a greater 
amount of special pension. 
My priority next Congress is to bring 
more veterans with toxic exposures 
into VA and create an easier process to 
get these veterans benefits. One group 
I have heard a lot about is K–2 vet-
erans, who served at Karshi-Khanabad 
Air Base in Uzbekistan. These service-
members slept in tents above soil that 
glowed and oozed, and, unsurprisingly, 
many later fell ill. 
Mr. Speaker, I fully support inclusion 
of legislation that partners with the 
Centers for Disease Control to study 
these exposures and resulting health 
effects. 
For veterans who have passed away, 
burial benefits ease the burden on 
grieving 
families. 
This 
legislative 
package expands these benefits, cre-
ating greater access. Representative 
DELGADO’s legislation makes counties 
eligible for VA grants to build and op-
erate veteran cemeteries, bringing a 
veteran’s final resting place closer to 
home for rural communities. 
Representative SABLAN’s legislation 
works to expand those grants, which 
are also available to States, territories, 
and Tribal governments, to cover in-
creasing costs of cemetery operations. 
This legislative package includes sev-
eral 
provisions 
from 
numerous 
healthcare-related bills, and I will just 
take a minute to highlight a few. 
I am really delighted we are able to 
include Representative GALLEGO’s Na-
tive American PACT Act, which pro-
hibits VA from collecting copays from 
a veteran who is a member of an Indian 
Tribe. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7105, as amended, 
also includes innovative ideas like Rep-
resentative KAPTUR’s the Vet HP Act, 
which seeks to expose undergraduate 
students considering careers in medi-
cine 
to 
directly 
experience 
VA’s 
healthcare environment. 
In addition, this package includes 
language 
requiring 
State 
veterans 
homes to provide VA with reoccurring 
reports on COVID–19 cases and related 
issues in the facility. This is one more 
way that VA and Congress can ensure 
veterans in State veterans homes have 
the resources they need during this 
public health emergency. 
Mr. Speaker, I am especially pleased 
this end-of-year package includes the 
Deborah Sampson Act, introduced by 
Representative JULIA
BROWNLEY, the 
chairwoman of the Veterans’ Affairs 
Health 
Subcommittee. 
Title 
V 
is 
named after Deborah Sampson, a Revo-
lutionary War veteran from Massachu-
setts who served in the Continental 
Army for 17 months and was wounded 
in battle more than once. 
Mr. Speaker, Deborah Sampson was 
neither the first nor the only woman to 
serve in the Continental Army, nor was 
she the first woman to be granted a 
pension by Congress, but she was the 
most persistent. Over 38 years, Con-
gress granted her a pension, backpay; 
and, 
ultimately, 
her 
husband 
was 
granted a survivor’s pension after her 
death. It is because of similar persist-
ence by women warriors who followed 
in Deborah Sampson’s footsteps that 
we are considering this legislation 
today. 
Among the numerous provisions in-
cluded in this legislation—perhaps the 
most important—relate to eliminating 
sexual harassment and assault. 
Today, nearly one in four new re-
cruits joining the military is a woman; 
and, as a result, women veterans are 
the fastest growing demographic in the 
veterans community, and VA must be 
prepared to welcome them. 
Unacceptably, at least one in four 
women veterans experience sexual and 
gender harassment at VA facilities. 
This must end. 
Mr. Speaker, last week, both the VA 
OIG and the Fort Hood Independent 
Review Committee issued reports that 
emphasized the need to do more to ad-
dress the toxic culture that exists at 
the Department of Defense and at VA. 
No veteran, caregiver, employee, con-
tractor, or other public visitor should 
experience sexual harassment or as-
sault at VA. 
H.R. 7105, as amended, requires VA to 
develop a comprehensive policy that 
includes bystander intervention, man-
datory reporting mechanisms for em-
ployees, confidential reporting mecha-
nisms for veterans, and holds leader-
ship accountable for addressing sexual 
harassment and assault at VA facili-
ties. 
This bill also includes provisions put 
forward by Representative PAPPAS that 
require new rules for how VA collects 
debts owed by beneficiaries to avoid 
unnecessary harm to veteran credit 
ratings, as well as to prevent many 
overpayments from happening due to 
eligibility changes. 
Mr. Speaker, finally, the bill before 
us improves the protections offered by 
the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act 
for veterans and their families. The in-
cluded legislation from Representa-
tives BUSTOS and ROSE provides addi-
tional protections to ensure that vet-
erans aren’t disadvantaged by their 
service to our Nation and that they are 
allowed more flexibility and protec-
tions for their employment and leases. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support H.R. 7105, as amended, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1430 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7105, the Johnny Isakson and 
David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health 
Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 
2020. 
This legislation is a culmination of 2 
years of bipartisan work by the House 
and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Commit-
tees. It contains provisions that will 
provide veterans and their families 
with improved access to care, com-
pensation, education, housing, and bur-
ial benefits that they have earned and 
will result in a Department of Veterans 
Affairs that is better able to meet their 
needs. 
I am proud that one of my last votes 
in Congress will be in support of this 
bill. I am also humbled that it bears 
my name and that of my friend, former 
Senator Johnny Isakson from Georgia. 
It was a pleasure to work with Senator 
Isakson as the chairman of the Senate 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee before his 
retirement last year. 
Our shared passion for serving our 
fellow veterans led to the creation and 
passage of landmark veterans’ legisla-
tion, including the MISSION Act, the 
Forever GI Bill, the Accountability and 
Whistleblower Protection Act, and the 
Veterans Appeals Improvement and 
Modernization Act. 
I am honored to share this recogni-
tion with him, and I thank our col-
leagues for recognizing our work in 
this way. It would take more time than 
I have to list every worthy proposal in 
this bill and thank every lawmaker, 
Republican and Democrat alike, who 
sponsored them. 
The many provisions included in this 
omnibus bill will support veterans and 
families from the time they transition 
out of the military to the time they 
are interred in a VA, State, Tribal, or 
private cemetery and at multiple crit-
ical touchpoints in between. 
For transitioning veterans, it will 
authorize a review of the Transition 
Assistance Program, or TAP; allow 
TAP to be provided at off-base loca-
tions; and support community organi-
zations that are supporting service-
members as they transition. 
For student veterans, it will expand 
the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Schol-
arship program to student veterans 
working on their medical degrees; re-
quire schools to provide all student 
veterans with in-state tuition, regard-
less of when they left Active Duty; 
make improvements and increase fund-
ing for the VET TEC pilot program to 
connect veterans with careers in the 
technology industry; strengthen over-
sight of schools that use the GI Bill; 
expand the restoration of benefits to 
students whose schools close in the 
middle of a term; and ensure that more 
servicemembers and veterans can take 
advantage of the improved benefits 
available through the Post-9/11 GI Bill. 
For veterans with service-connected 
disabilities, it will ensure that claims

for disability compensation include 
pertinent information from veterans’ 
private providers by requiring the VA 
to reinstate public-facing Disability 
Benefits Questionnaires, or DBQs, and 
issue a report detailing whether an al-
ternative 
disability 
exam 
process 
would better serve veterans and, if so, 
implement it. 
For women veterans, it will ensure 
that the VA healthcare system is more 
prepared for and responsive to their 
needs and help it instill a culture that 
is more welcoming, inclusive, and safe. 
For veterans who have experienced 
military sexual trauma, it will stream-
line benefits and make it easier to get 
the care and compensation they de-
serve. 
For veterans struggling with home-
lessness or housing insecurity, it will 
increase funding for transitional hous-
ing providers; improve case manage-
ment 
services 
in 
the 
HUD-VASH 
voucher program; provide additional 
funding and flexibility to allow service 
providers to care for those with chil-
dren and meet rising demands associ-
ated with COVID–19; authorize grant 
funding for legal services; and support 
those leaving the criminal justice sys-
tem. 
For veterans worried about their fi-
nances, it will address a major root 
cause of veteran debt by allowing vet-
erans to remove dependents from the 
eBenefits system. 
For veterans concerned about the 
general management and operation of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, it 
will improve VA’s work with Congress 
and the Government Accountability 
Office to address high-risk service lines 
and improve VA’s overall efficiency 
and effectiveness; and strengthen fi-
nancial management across the De-
partment, which is more important 
now than ever before as VA’s budget 
approaches $250 billion a year and total 
liabilities surpass $4 trillion. 
For veterans who are providing crit-
ical 
care 
and 
support 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic, it will provide a 
time-limited presumption of exposure 
to help streamline benefits for those 
who develop long-term disabilities as-
sociated with exposure to COVID–19 as 
a result of their service during this un-
forgettable moment in history. 
For veterans at the end of their lives, 
it will create a single burial benefit for 
non-service-connected veterans by rais-
ing the cost of the non-service-con-
nected burial allowance to match the 
allowance for veterans who pass away 
in a VA facility; allow VA to pay for 
certain burial transportation costs for 
families who choose to lay their loved 
ones to rest in a State or Tribal vet-
erans cemetery; and permit VA to re-
place a veteran’s VA-furnished head-
stone in a private cemetery to add me-
morial inscriptions for eligible family 
members. 
Finally, for veterans’ survivors, it 
will extend GI Bill survivor benefits to 
the families of servicemembers who 
died of a service-connected injury 
while in the Reserves, and it will ad-
dress an inequity in Federal benefits 
for surviving spouses by allowing them 
to retain their eligibility for VA De-
pendency and Indemnity Compensation 
if they remarry after the age of 55. 
I can go on and on; but, suffice to 
say, there is something in this bill for 
just about every one of our Nation’s 
veterans and their loved ones. 
I am very grateful to every Senator 
and Member of Congress who has intro-
duced one of the various pieces of legis-
lation in this package, including Re-
publican Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY of 
California; my good friend and incom-
ing Ranking Member MIKE BOST from 
Illinois; Congressman GUS
BILIRAKIS 
from Florida; General JACK BERGMAN 
from 
Michigan; 
Congressman 
JIM 
BANKS
from 
Indiana; 
Congressman 
ANDY BARR from Kentucky, Congress-
man ADAM
KINZINGER
from Illinois; 
Congressman 
DOUG
LAMALFA
from 
California; and Congressman JODEY 
ARRINGTON from Texas. 
This bill would not have been pos-
sible without the hard work, dedica-
tion, and support of numerous individ-
uals and organizations, including VA; 
our partners in the veteran service or-
ganization community; the Women 
Veterans Task Force; committee mem-
bers from both sides of the aisle, par-
ticularly the chairs and ranking mem-
bers of our Subcommittees on Dis-
ability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs, on Economic Opportunity, on 
Health, and on Oversight and Inves-
tigations; our colleagues on the Senate 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee; and last, 
but certainly not least, my good 
friends and fellow Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee leaders: Chairman TAKANO, 
Chairman MORAN, and Ranking Mem-
ber TESTER. 
Serving in the United States Army, 
Second Infantry Division, as I did, was 
a defining moment in my life. Helping 
to serve my fellow veterans in Congress 
these past 12 years along such an es-
teemed group of lawmakers who I am 
proud to call friends has been a honor 
of a lifetime. 
The 116th Congress has been one for 
the history books in more than one 
way. I hope that it will end on a high 
note today by passing this important 
bill and providing that, despite all of 
the challenges before us at this par-
ticular moment in time, Congress can 
still come together on a bipartisan 
basis to enact meaningful legislation 
on behalf of some of our most deserving 
constituents, the men and women who 
have so bravely defended our freedoms 
and the families and caregivers who 
support them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of my 
colleagues to join me in supporting 
this bill today, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Miss RICE), my good friend and 
member of the House Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee. 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of H.R. 7105, the John-
ny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Vet-
erans Health Care and Benefits Im-
provement Act. 
In addition to including the Deborah 
Sampson Act, a key piece of legislation 
that will improve healthcare and ac-
cess to VA services and benefits for 
women veterans, this legislation also 
includes the Boosting Rates of Amer-
ican Veteran Employment Act, which I 
introduced, along with Congressman 
PAUL COOK from California, to expand 
employment opportunities for our vet-
erans. 
The BRAVE Act is commonsense, bi-
partisan legislation that will authorize 
the VA Secretary to give preference to 
contractors with high concentrations 
of full-time veteran employees when 
awarding Federal contracts. 
First, this will reward companies 
that actively hire and invest in vet-
erans. Second, it will create an incen-
tive for other companies to do the 
same, which, in, turn will help bring 
more veterans into their workforce 
with good paying jobs, the types of op-
portunities that give veterans and 
their families the stability they need 
as they transition to civilian life. 
Most importantly, as more and more 
companies hire more and more vet-
erans, they will ultimately see that in-
vesting in veterans is just good for 
business. That is what the real incen-
tive should be. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
TAKANO and Ranking Member ROE for 
including the BRAVE Act in this bipar-
tisan bill package, and I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 7105 today. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), my 
good friend and new ranking member 
on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I 
have been in Mr. BOST’s district many 
times. I know his passion. He is a 
former marine. I guess once a marine, 
always a marine, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I stand in 
full support of H.R. 7105, and I am 
proud to be the sponsor of several pro-
visions included in today’s veterans’ 
omnibus bill. 
The first is a provision that would 
modernize the Service-Disabled Vet-
erans Insurance program by increasing 
the maximum coverage from $10,000 to 
$40,000; ensuring that veterans cannot 
be denied coverage for any preexisting 
condition; removing the requirement 
that veterans apply for coverage within 
2 years of receiving an award of service 
connection; and requiring premiums to 
cover the long-term cost of the pro-
gram, like the VA has with other life 
insurance programs. 
Once 
the 
modernization 
program 
goes into effect, the outdated program 
would be sunset for new applicants. 
Another provision of mine will au-
thorize a pilot program to extend li-
cense portability to certain nonphysi-
cian providers who perform disability 
exams under contract with the VA. As 
a result, contract vendors will be able 
to schedule a veteran’s exam sooner.

H7207 
December 16, 2020 
This is critical, as the VBA focuses its 
efforts on reducing the backlogs of dis-
ability exams that has been caused by 
the pandemic. 
Additionally, this bill will address a 
problem that occurred when a veteran 
has a change in their dependency sta-
tus, but the VA does not take imme-
diate action to reduce the veteran’s 
benefits payments. As a result, the vet-
eran may incur an overpayment that 
the veteran must pay back. My provi-
sion would allow a veteran to remove 
their 
dependent 
from 
their 
award 
through eBenefits within 60 days of the 
veteran’s input and without VA ap-
proval. 
This package also includes another 
one of my bills, H.R. 7445, which would 
expand eligibility for VA home loans 
programs to certain members of the 
National Guard and Reserve. 
Mr. Speaker, it is only right and log-
ical that members of the National 
Guard and Reserve who perform Fed-
eral Active Duty be given the same 
benefits as their full-time Active Duty 
counterparts. 
Before I close, I would like to thank 
Ranking Member ROE for his leader-
ship on the committee these past 4 
years, both as ranking member and as 
chairman. He has done a great job of 
representing the veterans of this Na-
tion and making sure that his focus 
and the committee’s focus is kept on 
what is best for them. 
I want to thank him for how he 
treats and works with each member of 
the staff, as well as each Member, to 
guide us through. Remember, under his 
guidance, we have enacted several 
pieces of legislative accomplishments, 
including appeals reform, the MISSION 
Act, and the Forever GI Bill. 
Now, as the full committee ranking 
member, I hope to follow in his foot-
steps, and I hope I can do him proud 
and continue our work to improve ben-
efits and services for our veterans and 
their families. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LEVIN), my good friend, who 
is also a member of the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee and is the 
Chairman of the Economic Opportunity 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, we simply cannot allow our vet-
erans to fall into homelessness, end up 
jobless, or go without the basic serv-
ices that they deserve. These chal-
lenges have only been exacerbated by 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I am proud to lead the Johnny Isak-
son and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans 
Health Care and Benefits Improvement 
Act so that we can do right by our vet-
erans during this pandemic and be-
yond. 
This legislation includes several of 
my bipartisan bills. It includes the Re-
ducing Veteran Homelessness Act and 
the Homeless Veteran Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act to lift veterans out of 
homelessness. 
It includes the Navy SEAL Chief 
Petty Officer William ‘‘Bill’’ Mulder 
Transition Improvement Act to ease 
the transition to civilian life and help 
veterans build meaningful careers. 
It includes the Protect the GI Bill 
Act and the Pandemic Assistance for 
Student Veterans Act to help veterans 
make the most of their GI Bill benefits. 
It includes the Brian Tally VA Em-
ployment Transparency Act to protect 
veterans’ legal rights. 
This legislation will make a real dif-
ference for veterans across the coun-
try, and I am proud of the bipartisan 
progress we are making today. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN), 
my good friend who represents the 
Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I think 
General BERGMAN is the highest rank-
ing officer who has served in the U.S. 
Congress, a marine. 
b 1445 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 7105, the John-
ny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Vet-
erans Health Care and Benefits Im-
provement Act of 2020. 
I consider the word ‘‘optimism’’ to 
mean hope that actually includes a 
plan, and I have sincere optimism that 
the bipartisan legislative package be-
fore us today will serve as a blueprint 
for the great work we can achieve in 
the next Congress by working together. 
More importantly, I have confidence 
that it will make a positive difference 
in veterans’ lives. 
For example, H.R. 7105 includes my 
legislation, the GI Bill Planning Act of 
2019, which will give military enlistees 
greater ability to consider which GI 
Bill benefits are right for them. 
Just think, in the heat of the first 2 
weeks of their boot camp, 70 percent of 
enlistees decide to pay $1,200 upfront to 
opt into their Montgomery GI Bill ben-
efit, but 97 percent actually end up 
using the more robust post-9/11 GI Bill. 
By delaying this Montgomery GI Bill 
opt-in decision 6 months and respon-
sibly ending new enrollment in 10 
years, we will actually save recruits 
money and ensure they are more in-
formed on their future education bene-
fits. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman 
and the ranking member for including 
not only my bill but several other 
major measures that I have co-led to 
improve VA transparency in benefits 
decisions, as well as increase account-
ability in the Department’s efforts to 
address programs that are at a high 
risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 7105, and I wish Dr. ROE 
fair winds and following seas. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. BRINDISI), my good friend, 
who is also a member of the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. 
Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 7105. 
I am proud that this bill includes the 
Chuck Osier Burial Benefits Act, which 
would require the VA to furnish an urn 
or a plaque if a deceased eligible vet-
eran was not interred in a traditional 
cemetery. All veterans deserve to be 
honored for their service, regardless of 
how their families choose to lay them 
to rest. 
It is named in honor of Chuck Osier, 
an Air Force veteran from Sherrill, 
New York, who passed away in 2015. Be-
cause Chuck was not interred in a tra-
ditional cemetery, his family could not 
honor him with a VA-furnished mark-
er. 
His widow, Donna, has been working 
with Members of Congress from central 
New York for years to get this fixed. I 
am proud to stand here for Chuck and 
Donna and finally get this bill passed. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation for 
our Nation’s veterans and their fami-
lies. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), my 
good friend, my neighbor just north of 
me in Kentucky, and a very, very 
prominent member of the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in strong support of H.R. 7105, the 
Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. 
Veterans Health Care and Benefits Im-
provement Act of 2020. 
Let me start by thanking my good 
friend, the ranking member of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, a former 
chairman of this committee, for his 
service to this country, not just as a 
veteran himself, but also leading this 
committee and being a tireless cham-
pion of the men and women who have 
served our country in uniform, through 
all of his accomplishments on this 
committee. 
I am so grateful for what you have 
done for our veterans and, on a per-
sonal note, as a mentor to me and so 
many others, leading the way, showing 
your patriotism. You are going to be 
missed here, but we appreciate your 
friendship. 
I am grateful, Mr. Speaker, that the 
two bipartisan bills I introduced this 
Congress are included in this com-
prehensive 
veterans 
package: 
an 
amended version of my bill, H.R. 7795, 
the Veterans Benefits Fairness and 
Transparency Act of 2020, which I in-
troduced with my Democratic col-
league, Representative ELAINE
LURIA 
from Virginia; and H.R. 5772, the Vet-
eran STEM Scholarship Enhancement 
Act, which I introduced and later 
worked on with Representative LAUREN 
UNDERWOOD from Illinois. 
My bill, the Veterans Benefits Fair-
ness and Transparency Act of 2020 will 
make it easier for veterans to file their 
disability claims by requiring the VA 
to restore the availability of disability 
benefits questionnaires, or DBQs, to 
their publicly available website so that 
a veteran can use their own personal 
healthcare provider when filing for 
benefits. This bill also cuts red tape 
and bureaucracy by preventing a vet-
eran’s claim from being rejected just

because the VA changed a line on a 
form. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
my constituent, retired Master Gun-
nery Sergeant Kenneth Gilliam, a 30- 
year Marine Corps veteran, and Ken-
tucky Sixth District Veterans Coali-
tion member retired Chief Warrant Of-
ficer Denny Hart, who were the inspira-
tion for this legislation. 
My other bill, the Veteran STEM 
Scholarship Enhancement Act allows 
the VA to more quickly process vet-
eran scholarship applications for the 
Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholar-
ship by lifting the requirement for pri-
ority groups among eligible veterans 
applying for the scholarship unless the 
VA determines that it is nearing the 
scholarship’s yearly funding limit. 
This bill also prevents the Rogers 
STEM scholarship from counting to-
ward the 48-month limit a veteran 
can— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, this bill also 
prevents the Rogers STEM scholarship 
from counting toward the 48-month 
limit a veteran can receive GI benefits. 
I have seen veterans in my district in 
central and eastern Kentucky, espe-
cially at Eastern Kentucky University, 
take 
advantage 
of 
this 
important 
scholarship. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of my vote 
for this package that delivers for our 
Nation’s veterans. I thank, again, my 
colleagues for working in a bipartisan 
way to shepherd this very important 
package of veteran advocacy legisla-
tion to fruition. 
Once again, I thank my good friend 
for his distinguished service in this 
body, Dr. PHIL ROE. Thank you, sir. It 
has been an honor serving with you on 
this subcommittee especially. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS), my good 
friend who is also a member of the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee and 
chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Oversight and Investigations. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman TAKANO for getting this im-
portant legislation to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7105, a crucial piece of veterans 
legislation that aptly bears the name 
of our distinguished ranking member, 
Dr. ROE. 
The bill now includes three pieces of 
legislation that I introduced to ensure 
VA is able to fulfill its mission of sup-
porting all those who have borne the 
battle. These three provisions will help 
improve the quality of care and address 
deficiencies that frustrate and even 
harm our veterans. 
The first requires VA to address bu-
reaucratic waste, fraud, abuse, and 
mismanagement identified by the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office’s High 
Risk List. 
A second provisions honors the sac-
rifices of our female veterans by ensur-
ing they have access to properly fitted 
prosthetic items, just as their male 
counterparts do. 
The third focuses on punitive debt 
collection practices by VA against our 
veterans, many of whom have done ev-
erything right. This provision sets lim-
its on when VA may initiate collection 
proceedings and even gives our vet-
erans the ability to update crucial ben-
efit information online. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House and 
Senate committees for getting this bi-
partisan bill to the floor, and I urge my 
colleagues to pass this legislation 
today. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON), 
who served on the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee and the Ways and Means 
Committee. He has been a tireless ad-
vocate for veterans during that time. 
Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, 
there would not be a Texas if it were 
not for Tennessee. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, how 
can a Texan respond to that in the 3 
minutes that has been allotted to me? 
Mr. Speaker, I will say, with all sin-
cerity, what an incredible man, what a 
great statesman and a leader for this 
country. For all things good about our 
veterans and the promises that we have 
made and the services that we render 
to them, Dr. PHIL ROE, what a hero and 
what a great mentor to many of us. 
I join the many who have benefited 
from your friendship and leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Chairman 
TAKANO’s friendship, and I thank him 
for his leadership and his love for our 
veterans. Our country’s character, I 
think we would say, could be measured 
in a few ways. One of them is how we 
treat those who we send off to battle. 
In addition to being the right thing 
to do—that is, deliver on the promises 
we make to our veterans—it is also 
good national security policy. It is 
more than just recruiting the right 
people and providing the best training. 
If we are going to maintain the great-
est fighting force in all the world, we 
need to make sure we do right by our 
Active Duty military men and women 
as they transition to civilian life and 
being veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to focus on title 
IV of this piece of legislation. It is the 
Transition 
Assistance 
Improvement 
Act that I have worked on for a few 
years now. It is named after my dear 
friend from high school, Bill Mulder, 
Chief Petty Officer Navy SEAL Bill 
Mulder. I love saying his name. 
He is a warrior’s warrior. He, too, 
gave his life for this country. He suf-
fered and struggled with the wounds of 
battle that you can’t easily see. Let’s 
put it that way. 
I am so grateful to Chairman TAKANO 
and Chairman ROE, and my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle, espe-
cially Representative MIKE LEVIN, for 
helping shepherd this along and hon-
oring Bill Mulder and his family and, 
in doing so, passing this legislation 
that will engage our Active Duty mili-
tary earlier in the process, before they 
venture out as civilians, to equip them 
and empower them with education and 
opportunities for employment and to 
connect them with their brothers and 
sisters, fellow veterans in the commu-
nity. 
All the component parts of this, I 
think, will end up with lives saved, less 
Bill Mulders, in terms of his final chap-
ter, and less pain for wives of military 
personnel, like Sydney Mulder. 
To Sydney, let me say thank you for 
your sacrifice. 
To Bill’s children, Nina, Jake, and 
Sam, thank you for what you guys rep-
resent in military families. Your dad is 
a true American hero. His legacy will 
not stop here. It will live on in you, 
and it will live on in the lives that it 
changes because of this piece of legisla-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. 
ARRINGTON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
thank you for indulging me. 
God bless the Mulder family. God 
bless those who serve our great coun-
try. 
I pray to God that this will help 
make an impact on the real lives of our 
veterans as they transition and maxi-
mize their greatest God-given potential 
as civilians once again. That is the way 
this ought to work, and I know that is 
our desire. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Texas and his de-
votion to Bill Mulder and his memory. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), 
my good friend, a longtime friend to 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and a 
senior member of the Appropriations 
Committee. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman TAKANO for his dedication 
and leadership to move these import 
veterans provisions through Congress. 
Included in this package is my bill, 
the Veterans-Specific Education for 
Tomorrow’s Health Professionals Act. 
The VET HP Act will create a 1-year 
pilot program to allow pre-med stu-
dents to gain clinical observation expe-
rience at VA medical centers. I thank 
the chairman for his leadership in help-
ing include this. 
This legislation will not only in-
crease opportunities for students from 
diverse backgrounds to gain the clin-
ical observation time they need for 
medical school, but it will also allow 
them the opportunity to gain a deeper 
understanding 
of 
veterans’ 
specific 
health needs and experiences, which we 
just heard about, while connecting 
them with the VA medical system. 
In identifying and training future 
physicians interested in serving vet-
erans, this legislation will, hopefully, 
help fill some of the estimated 30,000

medical vacancies at the Department 
of Veterans Affairs by creating a viable 
pipeline of future physicians. 
Mr. Speaker, one of our highest re-
sponsibilities as a Congress is to ensure 
our veterans receive the timely, high-
est quality care they deserve from 
trained professionals. I am pleased that 
this bill, the VET HP Act, with the 
leadership of Chairman TAKANO
and 
with my sponsorship as well, will di-
rectly support these priorities. 
b 1500 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), a champion and a 
staunch advocate, who is unparalleled 
in her support for our Nation’s 22 mil-
lion veterans. 
Under the Speaker’s leadership, the 
House has passed the largest increases 
in veterans funding in history, includ-
ing investments in mental health serv-
ices, 
Agent 
Orange 
disability, 
healthcare benefits, economic and edu-
cational opportunities, as well as job 
training. 
She understands we must build up, 
not tear down, the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs. She has upheld the sa-
cred pledge that, just as the military 
leaves no one behind on the battlefield, 
we must leave no veteran behind here 
at home. 
This Congress, with her support, we 
have continued to preserve the sacred 
trust of our men and women in uniform 
and the 200,000 servicemembers who be-
come veterans each year. 
Mr. Speaker, I am, of course, refer-
ring to the Speaker of this great House 
from the great State of California, the 
Honorable NANCY D’ALESANDRO PELOSI. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
great leadership. He makes us so proud 
as the chair of the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee. 
I proudly rise in support of H.R. 7105, 
a strong bipartisan package of legisla-
tion that strives to meet our respon-
sibilities to honor the service and sac-
rifice of those who don the uniform. 
The strength of this package and its 
support across the aisle is a testament 
to the outstanding leadership of Chair-
man MARK TAKANO. We are very proud 
of him as a Californian and as a Mem-
ber of this House. 
The bill has been an all-hands-on- 
deck effort, and I salute the many 
Members whose provisions and perspec-
tives have strengthened it: 
Congresswoman JULIA BROWNLEY, the 
chair of the Health Subcommittee and 
the Women’s Veterans Task Force, who 
has worked tirelessly to achieve gender 
equity at VA, including, now, through 
the landmark Deborah Sampson Act 
included in this omnibus; 
Congressman MIKE LEVIN, the pride 
of our freshman class, who introduced 
this omnibus as chair of the Sub-
committee on Economic Opportunity, 
who has been a champion for the finan-
cial security of our veterans on every-
thing 
from 
the 
GI 
Bill 
to 
antihomelessness initiatives. 
And to you, Mr. Ranking Member 
ROE, thank you for your leadership and 
your friendship and prioritizing our 
veterans. I am so proud that this bill is 
named for you. Congratulations to you, 
and thank you. 
I also recognize former Senator John-
ny Isakson. What a great person he is. 
What a great Member of the Senate he 
has been. I enjoyed being with him 
when we were saluting our veterans at 
Normandy, when he made that visit 
there and made us all so proud. 
Johnny was always bipartisan, reach-
ing across the aisle for our veterans, 
and it was a joy to serve in this House 
as he served as a Senator. But I want 
him to know that he is very missed 
and, again, recognized for his leader-
ship. 
Mr. Speaker, last year, many Mem-
bers were blessed to be able to travel to 
Europe to mark 75 years of the Nor-
mandy landing and the Battle of the 
Bulge on another visit. 
At the commemoration of the Battle 
of the Bulge, almost 1 year ago this 
day, I met a veteran in his nineties 
who urged us to pray for peace. He 
spoke for the veterans who were gath-
ered there in a program with the King 
of Belgium and the President of Ger-
many. It was very interesting. The Sec-
retary of Defense spoke, but the vet-
eran spoke for the veterans, and he 
talked about the camaraderie and the 
band of brothers and all that, but at 
the end, he said: Pray for peace. 
In that same spirit of peace, hope, 
and respect, this Congress has honored 
our veterans and their families and 
caregivers with transformative action: 
from the Blue Water Navy Vietnam 
Veterans Act to expand protections for 
those devastated by exposure to Agent 
Orange, to ending the cruelly unfair 
widows tax and kiddie tax—remember 
that?—to passing the COMPACT Act to 
combat veteran suicide, to investing 
nearly $20 billion in VA readiness in 
pandemic research. 
Now the House is building on this bi-
partisan momentum with this omni-
bus, which includes provisions from 
nearly 60 House-passed bills. 
This bill strengthens veterans’ edu-
cation, investing nearly $350 million in 
improving GI benefits for surviving 
family members, increasing work study 
options and fellowship opportunities 
for veterans, securing benefits for 
those who cannot complete courses due 
to the pandemic, and more. 
It safeguards veterans’ benefits, in-
cluding by modernizing the benefit sys-
tem with commonsense reforms, in-
vesting 
in 
benefits 
for 
surviving 
spouses, and improving eligibility for 
housing and home loan assistance for 
National Guard and Reserve members. 
This bill protects veterans’ health, 
improving care for those exposed to the 
coronavirus and burn pits, improving 
VA’s scheduling process, and increas-
ing reporting from State veterans’ 
homes in light of COVID outbreaks. 
This bill is focused on justice, equal-
ity, and opportunity, and we are par-
ticularly proud of the steps taken to 
help servicemembers transition to the 
civilian workforce and to improve serv-
ices and VA access for Native Amer-
ican veterans, including eliminating 
their copays. 
House Members can take pride in the 
inclusion 
of 
Congresswoman 
BROWNLEY’s Deborah Sampson Act, a 
crown jewel in this package and the 
most comprehensive women veterans 
bill in over a decade. 
This bill improves the health, bene-
fits, education, and VA support system 
for women veterans, including by re-
quiring 
VA 
to 
create 
the 
antiharassment and antiassault policy, 
improving 
women-specific 
primary 
healthcare, 
expanding 
access 
to 
childcare, and strengthening mental 
health initiatives. 
This bill could not be more timely. 
Last week, the VA inspector general’s 
report revealed the appalling coverup 
and discrediting of a woman veteran 
who works on the task force that cre-
ated this legislation at the hands of 
Secretary Wilkie and top VA officials. 
It is a profound injustice for any pa-
triot with the courage to serve to have 
to experience having his or her voice 
silenced and integrity questioned. Con-
gress will not relent until every serv-
icemember, 
every 
veteran, 
every 
woman can live free from the fear of 
assault or abuse. 
This package was drafted—this is 
what I am so proud of, because, on a 
regular basis, we meet with the veteran 
service organizations, and it is their 
opportunity to tell us what their prior-
ities are. There are so many issues that 
needed to be addressed. Some of them I 
have already mentioned here that have 
been addressed over time and right 
now. But their wisdom and their expe-
rience and their patriotism really helps 
shape our agenda. 
Thank you, Mr. TAKANO, for listening 
and for acting upon the knowledge and 
values they give us. 
This package was drafted in con-
sultation with leading veterans groups, 
and we are proud to have the support of 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the 
American Legion, the Military Officers 
Association of America, Student Vet-
erans of America, Disabled American 
Veterans, the National Military Fam-
ily Association, Iraq and Afghan Vet-
erans of America, the Association of 
the U.S. Navy, Paralyzed Veterans of 
America, and Veterans Education Suc-
cess, just to name a few. The list goes 
on. 
As we send this package to the Presi-
dent’s desk, House Democrats 
are 
ready to take further action to honor 
our veterans in the next Congress, 
working alongside the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration. 
Just as the military pledges to leave 
no one behind on the battlefield, we 
solemnly promise to leave no veteran

behind. That is particularly personal to 
me, having four brothers who served in 
the armed services, an uncle who died 
in World War II, but also a daughter 
who is so committed to our veterans 
that practically every day she will say 
to me: What did you do for our vet-
erans today? And not just on Veterans 
Day. 
As we send this package, recognize 
that our work on behalf of veterans, 
their families, and their caregivers 
must be bipartisan and of the highest 
priority. I urge the passage of this bill. 
And as I say to those VSOs when 
they come in: Understand this; for you 
and to honor you, we pledge to always 
work as much as possible in a bipar-
tisan way. 
That is the way they would want us 
to do so. That is why I am particularly 
proud, Congressman ROE, to recognize 
your leadership, and I am so happy 
that this bill is named for you and for 
Johnny Isakson, as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I once again voice my 
appreciation for Mr. TAKANO for his 
great leadership. I thank him. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I am sure 
Christine Pelosi is going to be tweeting 
in just a few moments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Mr. 
COURTNEY), my good friend and mem-
ber of the Armed Services Committee 
and senior member of the Education 
and Labor Committee. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of this bill and salute Mr. 
TAKANO
and Mr. ROE
for their fine 
work. 
In particular, I want to foot stomp 
section 2011, which instructs GAO to 
conduct an independent analysis of the 
VA’s 1-year manifestation rule, which 
has unfairly blocked benefits for three 
debilitating 
conditions 
caused 
by 
Agent Orange dioxin used in the Viet-
nam war. 
In a nutshell, veterans are required 
to show these illnesses manifested 
themselves within 1 year of exposure in 
order to get VA help. Only one prob-
lem: 50 years ago, when servicemem-
bers were handling this poison, the 
U.S. Government never disclosed how 
dangerous it was. When its toxicity 
was finally recognized decades later, 
the 1-year clock to prove manifestation 
had long expired. It is the ultimate 
catch-22. 
Section 2011 would not exist but for 
the tireless work of Vietnam veteran 
Gerry 
Wright 
from 
Andover, 
Con-
necticut, who has crisscrossed America 
rounding up support for abolishing this 
rule—no lobbyists, no super-PACs, just 
old-fashioned citizen activism. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Gerry. 
He is a true patriot. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
bill. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. KILDEE), my good friend. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman TAKANO and Ranking Mem-
ber ROE and my Michigan colleague, 
JACK BERGMAN, with whom I worked on 
this legislation, for bringing this bill to 
the floor, which includes my legisla-
tion, the Transparency For Wounded 
Warriors Act. 
This legislation will improve the 
Traumatic 
Servicemembers’ 
Group 
Life Insurance program, known as 
TSGLI, which provides financial sup-
port to help servicemembers recover 
from severe injuries. 
This issue came to me 7 years ago as 
a result of an injury suffered by Ser-
geant First Class Cameron Corder from 
Clio, Michigan, my neighbor just a few 
miles away from where I live, who sus-
tained a severe back injury while on 
Active Duty serving as a flight medic 
in Afghanistan. 
Despite his traumatic injury, the 
Army repeatedly denied his TSGLI 
claims, and for years my staff and I 
fought all the way to the top rungs of 
the military to try to get Cameron his 
benefits. Finally, in November of 2017, 
after years of denials, Cameron re-
ceived those benefits. 
His experience, though, was a clear 
case of bureaucratic harm suffered by a 
Wounded Warrior. His treatment was 
unacceptable. This legislation will, 
hopefully, ensure that it won’t happen 
to other servicemembers. 
I am pleased that the House has in-
cluded this bill in this bipartisan pack-
age. When it comes to my constituents 
and veterans, I don’t give up until I 
win. 
I thank my friend Chairman TAKANO, 
and I especially thank Dr. ROE. I very 
much enjoyed serving with you and 
look forward to staying connected to 
you in some fashion. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. GALLEGO). 
Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 7105. This important 
package includes a bill I authored, H.R. 
4908, the Native American Veteran 
PACT Act. 
Native people have fought in every 
American war since the American Rev-
olution, more than a century before 
they were even granted citizenship. 
When I served in Iraq, I fought along-
side Navajo marines, some of the best 
marines you will ever meet. I have wit-
nessed, firsthand, Native communities’ 
tradition of service to America, which 
is why I introduced the PACT Act, to 
make sure America keeps its promises 
to these heroes. 
The PACT Act would prohibit the VA 
from charging copays to Native Amer-
ican veterans. The United States Gov-
ernment has a treaty obligation to pro-
vide healthcare to Native Americans 
free of charge. 
b 1515 
Despite this, the VA has long charged 
Native veterans unconstitutional co-
payments for their care. That should 
end today. 
Now more than ever, in the midst of 
a health crisis that has been dispropor-
tionately affecting Native people, we 
need to make sure that Native veterans 
have access to the healthcare they are 
due, both as veterans and as members 
of Tribal nations. 
That is why, Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this important 
provision to uphold our trust responsi-
bility and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the under-
lying package. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. DELGADO), my good friend. 
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman, Mr. TAKANO, for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7105. This legislation incor-
porates two bills I was proud to intro-
duce. 
The first bill is my bipartisan Fair-
ness for Local Veteran Cemeteries Act, 
an easy bipartisan fix to allow local-
ities to honor our Nation’s veterans. 
As the law is currently written, only 
State-run veteran cemeteries are eligi-
ble for the National Cemetery Admin-
istration’s Veterans Cemetery Grants. 
This cripples counties and States that 
don’t 
have 
State-operated 
veteran 
cemeteries, including New York, Flor-
ida, Alaska, and Oregon, where veteran 
cemeteries are operated by counties or 
county-equivalents. 
Our bill will ensure counties and lo-
calities can use Federal funds to help 
run veteran cemeteries. 
H.R. 7105 also incorporates my Im-
proving Benefits for Underserved Vet-
erans Act, which would require the VA 
to publish a report on veterans’ bene-
fits, disaggregating by sex or minority 
group member status. This is an impor-
tant step in leveling the playing field 
for women and minority veterans. 
The men and women of the armed 
services dedicate their lives to defend-
ing our Nation and its values. I am 
proud to support this legislation that 
helps our Nation provide better care 
for our veterans and protect their final 
resting place. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. HAALAND), my good friend. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to put on their 
masks. 
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, as one 
of the first Native American women 
elected to Congress and the daughter of 
two veterans, I am proud that my bill 
with Representative MIKE GALLAGHER, 
the Department of Veterans Affairs 
Tribal Advisory Committee Act, will 
be included in this package.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7211 
December 16, 2020 
All veterans deserve the best care 
that our country can give, but there 
are gaps in services for Native Amer-
ican veterans. 
The advisory committee established 
by this bill will ensure that we look at 
and remedy the specific barriers Native 
American veterans face so they will 
have access to the same care that other 
veterans have. 
For these reasons and many more, I 
am thankful for the inclusion of my 
bill today and look forward to seeing 
its implementation by President-elect 
Biden. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman from California 
(Mr. TAKANO) has expired. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I am prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, it is obvious today, 
with the minority leader, the Speaker, 
and numerous, numerous distinguished 
Members coming to speak, the impor-
tance of this. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
TAKANO for his work on this. I thank 
all the Members who, in a bipartisan 
way, brought this extremely important 
bill to fruition. 
I certainly appreciate the honor of 
having this bill named after Senator 
ISAKSON and myself, and I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7105, the 
Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improve-
ment Act, includes my bill helping get more 
funding for operations and maintenance to lo-
cally-run, veterans cemeteries nationwide. 
My legislation, H.R. 5487, increases the 
amount the VA can grant for this purpose 
each year from $5 million to $10 million. As 
more veterans choose to be buried close to 
their home, more states, territories, and tribal 
governments are applying for funding from the 
VA to help cover the costs of operating and 
maintaining local veterans cemeteries. 
And, while the list of applications grows, the 
amount the Department can award has not. 
Under current law, no more than $5 million 
can be awarded per year to meet the needs 
of over 100 cemeteries. 
H.R. 5487, the Veterans Cemetery Grants 
Improvement Act updates that authorization by 
a modest $5 million. The Act will help veteran 
cemeteries in every state, territory, and tribal 
nation, remain the dignified and well-main-
tained resting places our veterans deserve. 
I know in my own district, the Northern Mar-
iana Islands, the veterans cemetery, built with 
federal funds, faces challenges in this respect. 
Veterans’ families have come to me for help 
and this bill responds. 
I know my co-sponsor, Representative 
STEIL, shares this concern for the Southern 
Wisconsin Veterans Memorial Cemetery in his 
district, as do other Members for the ceme-
teries that serve their constituents. 
And I know the members of this House are 
committed to honoring our nation’s veterans 
and their families, who have sacrificed so 
much to ensure our country remains safe and 
free. 
I thank Chairman TAKANO
and Senator 
TESTER for all their support to include into H.R. 
7105 this important measure. 
I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 7105. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the bill, H.R. 7105. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the Senate 
amendment was concurred in. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
TRANSPARENCY AND EFFECTIVE 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
MEASURES 
FOR VETERAN CAREGIVERS ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
2216) to require the Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs to formally recognize 
caregivers of veterans, notify veterans 
and caregivers of clinical determina-
tions relating to eligibility for the 
family caregiver program, and tempo-
rarily extend benefits for veterans who 
are determined ineligible for the fam-
ily caregiver program, and for other 
purposes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7212 
December 16, 2020 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 2216. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
2216, Senator PETERS’ bill, the TEAM 
Veteran Caregivers Act. 
This legislation clarifies certain ele-
ments of VA’s program of comprehen-
sive assistance for family caregivers 
and the general caregiver program. 
The bill formally recognizes a vet-
eran’s primary caregiver in the vet-
eran’s medical record and requires 
standardization in letters determining 
program eligibility. 
Additionally, it extends the benefits 
of the comprehensive program for 90 
days after a veteran has been deter-
mined to no longer be clinically eligi-
ble. This will allow the family care-
givers, who have likely forgone or 
minimized their own careers in order 
to care for veterans, the means and 
necessary time to transition back to 
the workforce without worrying about 
how to pay the bills. This is an unnec-
essary stress on those who have al-
ready been through so much. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support S. 2216, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself as much time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 2216, the TEAM Veteran Care-
givers Act. 
Just as our Nation’s veterans are he-
roes, so are their caregivers. When a 
servicemember or veteran is seriously 
injured in service to our country, their 
family caregiver serves as an irreplace-
able source of support and care during 
recovery and beyond. 
They are just as vital a part of the 
veteran’s care team as the veteran’s 
doctors and nurses. They deserve re-
spect, recognition, and support for all 
the work they do for their veteran 
loved ones and the personal sacrifices 
that work requires of them. 
Since the Department of Veterans 
Affairs’ family caregiver program was 
created by Congress in 2012, caregiver 
support services—including a monthly 
stipend, respite care, training, and 
healthcare, if needed—have been of-
fered to eligible caregivers of post-9/11 
veterans. 
We expanded the family caregiver 
program to include caregivers of pre-9/ 
11 veterans in the MISSION Act 2 years 
ago, and those caregivers began receiv-
ing benefits through the program in 
October. 
Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I 
didn’t say the Dole Foundation and 
Senator Dole had a great influence on 
this. 
Along with expanding the family 
caregiver program to caregivers of vet-
erans of all eras, VA also made several 
programmatic changes, which I hope 
will ensure the program works better 
for every single veteran and caregiver 
in need of it. However, it may also re-
sult in some caregivers who were for-
merly eligible for the program to no 
longer be eligible for it because their 
veteran loved one had sufficiently re-
covered as to no longer require the 
same level of caregiving services. 
To help individuals under those cir-
cumstances, this bill would require the 
VA to notify veterans and caregivers of 
medical decisions and determinations 
that may affect their eligibility for the 
family caregiver program and to ex-
tend the caregiver benefits on a tem-
porary basis to those who are deemed 
ineligible for the program, ensuring 
that they have time to adjust to life 
without the support it provides them. 
It would also require VA to list the 
names of caregivers in veterans’ elec-
tronic health records to ease commu-
nication between providers and care-
givers. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Sen-
ator GARY PETERS from Michigan and 
Senator MARSHA BLACKBURN, my fellow 
Tennessean, for introducing this bill, 
as well as Congressman ANDY BIGGS 
from Arizona for sponsoring the House 
companion to it. I thank each of them 
for their leadership on this issue and 
their commitment to caring for care-
givers. 
Mr. Speaker, I will be proudly sup-
porting this bill today, and I urge all of 
my colleagues to join me. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), my 
good friend, who is the House sponsor 
of this legislation. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. I thank the 
ranking member for all of his work 
here on this bill and so many others to 
benefit the lives of our veterans and 
their families. I appreciate it very 
much. 
I strongly support S. 2216, the TEAM 
Veteran Caregivers Act, and, as the 
sponsor of H.R. 6571, the House com-
panion of this legislation. 
Family caregivers assume enormous 
responsibilities 
by 
caring 
for 
our 
wounded veterans, including many who 
are among our most vulnerable. 
I introduced this legislation because 
one of my constituents, Ms. Sharon 
Grassi, came to us with her concerns 
related to the VA’s family caregiver 
program. Sharon is the mother and 
caregiver of her son Derek, a 100-per-
cent disabled veteran who served mul-
tiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as a 
combat medic. Since Derek’s departure 
from the service, Sharon has dedicated 
her life to securing the well-being of 
her son. 
Sharon told our office countless sto-
ries of her struggles attempting to gain 
access to her son’s VA medical records, 
even something as simple as a much- 
needed copy of an MRI. 
As many caregivers know, having 
timely access to medical records is ex-
tremely important to move forward in 
the recovery process of the patient. 
Sharon has had issues getting access to 
these records because the VA does not 
formally recognize family caregivers in 
the health records of the veteran. 
Today, we are one step closer to fix-
ing this issue by requiring the VA to 
report to Congress on the feasibility 
and the advisability of recognizing 
family caregivers in the electronic 
health records of the veteran. 
I will continue to work with my 
House and Senate colleagues and the 
VA to ensure that no family caregiver 
goes through the same bureaucratic 
nightmares as Sharon has. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all the care-
givers who support our wounded vet-
erans every day, the Elizabeth Dole 
Foundation, Disabled American Vet-
erans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, 
and all the veterans service organiza-
tions that voiced their strong support 
for this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, my col-
league from Tennessee, Dr. ROE, for his 
service in Congress and his strong sup-
port of our Nation’s veterans. I will say 
I respect him. His leadership and exper-
tise will be missed in the Halls of this 
Congress. 
Thank you, Dr. ROE. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I am prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to take a couple 
of minutes of personal privilege before 
I do close. 
This will be the last couple of days I 
am here on the House floor, and I 
would like to thank the constituents of 
the First Congressional District of 
Tennessee who have supported me 
overwhelmingly for the past 12 years. I 
cannot thank you enough. 
I have made so many great friends as 
I have traveled those 12 counties in 
rural east Tennessee, and I couldn’t be 
prouder of them. Certainly, my prayers 
are with them now during this COVID 
epidemic. 
This was a year like no one ever ex-
pected, Mr. Speaker. I think we will all 
look back years from now, and history 
will judge us on how we did now. 
I want to thank my family and 
friends that I have had. I would not be 
here without them. 
During this past 12 years, I have had, 
obviously, some personal issues. My 
wife died of cancer during the 12 years 
I was here. I lost a very dear personal 
friend not 6 weeks after that. My moth-
er died a year after that. And a year 
after that, I was diagnosed with cancer 
myself, and I am a cancer survivor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7213 
December 16, 2020 
I want to thank the people in this 
body and in this House for the personal 
support that they gave me and uplifted 
me, the Congressional Prayer Break-
fast, and just many friends, as Mr. 
BIGGS talked about, that would stop 
and speak to you and lift you up. I 
don’t think people see that. 
I want to thank my staff. I have had 
an incredible staff since I have been 
here. I am amazed at the insight and 
work that these young people do on 
both sides of the aisle. It is just amaz-
ing. We would not get this legislation 
completed. You see this big, thick 
binder right here. It is these staff mem-
bers that put this together, do the hard 
work, and bring us together. And I 
can’t thank them enough. 
And my colleagues: I have met and 
made some amazing friends that will 
last a lifetime here. 
I remember, and I will pass this 
along, an old coach told me this once. 
We were at a Boy Scout camp and I was 
a counselor there. One of the scouts 
ran up and said: ‘‘Coach, Coach, we 
have a problem down at shower house 
number 2.’’ 
And he said: ‘‘What is it?’’ 
The scout said: ‘‘Well, the toilet is 
stopped up.’’ 
And the coach, I will never forget 
this, he said: ‘‘We don’t have problems 
here. We have opportunities.’’ 
So, basically, we have had a lot of op-
portunities, I have, since I have been 
here. 
I have been able to serve on some 
committees, 
the 
Veterans’ 
Affairs 
Committee, which I have been a mem-
ber since day one; the Education and 
Labor Committee, which I had the 
privilege of serving as the chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Health, Employ-
ment, Labor, and Pensions. I served a 
term on the Agriculture Committee. I 
served on the Joint Select Committee 
on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension 
Plans. I have co-chaired the GOP Doc-
tors Caucus for the past several terms. 
b 1530 
Mr. Speaker, I mean this sincerely. 
No one person does any of these things. 
It does take a team effort. And that 
team effort, you heard it today, you 
heard both sides of the aisle contribute 
to this piece of legislation that we just 
passed by voice vote. 
We were able to pass in a bipartisan 
way the MISSION Act, which will fun-
damentally change—it is a very com-
plex 
act 
that 
will 
fundamentally 
change how veterans get their care and 
improve the quality of care for our vet-
erans. 
The Forever GI Bill—Mr. Speaker, 
when I got out of the Army in 1975, I 
was able to use the GI Bill, and I know 
it paid me $300 a month for 2 years. It 
sunsetted at 10 years. This Congress 
fully paid for that. 
These young people now, these men 
and women who have served this coun-
try, can use that benefit the rest of 
their lives and that benefit can be 
transferred. It is an incredible help to 
families now with the high cost of edu-
cation. 
We had an SGR, the sustainable 
growth rate repeal, and Medicare re-
form, the Medicare wage index reform. 
We passed the National Desert Storm 
and Desert Shield War Memorial Act. 
With Whip HOYER, we passed an 
EpiPen bill so that they can be put it 
schools around the country. And I can 
tell you, after that happened, in my 
own district about 3 years ago, a stu-
dent had an anaphylactic reaction. She 
did not know she had a problem. And a 
life was saved because of that. 
I think if I did anything in Con-
gress—and I want to thank Mr. HOYER 
for his help with that. We have another 
asthma bill that is getting hot lined in 
the Senate, to show you can do bipar-
tisan work across the aisle. 
That is just a few of the things that 
we were able to succeed and do. These 
are, again, not done by any one person. 
They are done as a team. And I want to 
thank everyone who helped make my 
time here in Congress successful. 
I can tell you, it is one of the great 
privileges of my life to serve in the 
House of Representatives, in the great-
est deliberative body in the world, the 
United States Congress. It is an honor 
I will never forget, Mr. Speaker. 
I will finish by saying that I encour-
age my colleagues to support this bill 
and, graciously, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I would just like to take a few mo-
ments to say even more words of praise 
for my colleague, Dr. PHIL ROE, my 
ranking member. We have served on 
two committees coterminously: the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee, which 
you chaired and which I now chair and 
which we have been both ranking mem-
bers; and the Education and Labor 
Committee. 
It is sort of a fate of coincidence, but 
it has been an absolute pleasure to be 
your colleague, sir. I wish you well in 
this next chapter of your life. 
I especially want to take note of the 
example you set by organizing the con-
gressional delegation trip to Afghani-
stan. I believe it was either my first 
term or my second term in Congress. 
What an honor that was to travel with 
you and a bipartisan delegation to 
serve turkey dinner during Thanks-
giving. I never forgot that lesson. 
I vowed that if I ever became chair-
man of the committee, that we would 
do the same thing, we would continue 
that tradition of serving our troops 
who cannot be with their families dur-
ing the holiday season. 
That spirit of service carried into the 
work that you have done and I have 
done together, with all the Members. 
We say it is a team effort. It is a spe-
cial part of the Congress that we have 
staff that interact with each other, not 
primarily in an antagonistic mode. 
There are differences, but we work 
them out and we work them out bi-
camerally. 
I note that Mr. Towers is going to go 
work on the other side, and I say that 
with all great affection. Some things 
will change, some things will stay con-
stant. 
This behemoth, it is more than 300 
pages of legislative text. That is a tes-
tament to the spirit of wanting to do 
right. 
I want to congratulate my own staff 
director, Ray Kelley, for that amazing 
work of both he and Jon and their 
counterparts in the Senate. This could 
not be the work of PHIL ROE and myself 
alone. It was the work of incredible 
leadership at the staff level. 
I could go on and name every staff 
person. I have 28—29 staffers, and they 
all have performed magnificently to 
produce, I think, this incredible holi-
day gift to America’s veterans and to 
America. 
So PHIL ROE, thank you for, together, 
this gift that our teams have created 
for our country. Thank you for the gift 
you have been to our country. 
And my final word to you is, on your 
next chapter, Godspeed. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 2216. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7215 
December 16, 2020 
The bill provides funding to State, 
local, and community organizations to 
provide incarcerated and recently re-
leased individuals with mental health 
and substance abuse treatment. Pro-
viding continuity of care in relation to 
mental health and substance abuse 
treatment when individuals are re-
leased from correctional facilities is a 
critical bridge back into their commu-
nities; but continuity of care of this 
sort is seldom available to returning 
citizens. This bill addresses that gap. 
At a series of hearings this Congress, 
the Judiciary Committee has explored 
the many challenges that recently re-
leased individuals face. These return-
ing citizens confront a myriad of bar-
riers that hamper reentry. Unfortu-
nately, many struggle with mental 
health and substance abuse. Navigating 
reentry, which is already daunting, can 
be made even more difficult due to 
these additional challenges. 
Because the need is great, the reach 
of this bill is broad. The grants award-
ed by S. 3312 improve mental health 
and substance abuse treatment during 
pretrial detention, throughout incar-
ceration, and upon return to the com-
munity. Eligible grantees include juve-
nile justice agencies, mental health 
agencies, and community-based behav-
ioral health providers. 
The bill’s keen focus on the provision 
of care by local, community-based pro-
viders is deliberate, as this is con-
sistent with long-term reentry success. 
This is why I am particularly sup-
portive of this provision of the bill that 
implements a preference for grantees 
that provide community-based care 
and promote policies that reduce the 
number of technical probation viola-
tions. 
Also notable in S. 3312 is the broad 
panoply of mental health services that 
it incorporates. These include peer sup-
port, 
enrollment 
in 
long-term 
healthcare programs, and introduction 
to clinically proven medications. This 
bill recognizes that no single reentry 
solution will work for every returning 
individual. 
The programs authorized in S. 3312 
would further promote much-needed 
cooperative efforts among criminal and 
juvenile 
justice 
agencies, 
mental 
health agencies, and community-based 
behavioral health providers. 
The 
programs 
receiving 
funding 
under this bill would engage relevant 
stakeholders in the formulation of pro-
gram design, implementation, training 
on 
services, 
and 
examination 
of 
healthcare reimbursement issues that 
may pose a barrier to ensuring long- 
term financial sustainability of these 
programs. 
The holistic approach to reentry that 
this bill adopts has consistently been 
shown to promote successful reentry 
and offer better long-term solutions. 
In recent years, Congress passed the 
hallmark Second Chance Act and a 
number of other bills, including H.R. 
8161, the One Stop Community Reentry 
Program Act, focused on promoting 
successful reentry and, in turn, sup-
porting public safety. Like those bills, 
S. 3312, the Crisis Stabilization and 
Community Reentry Act, is a nec-
essary tool to ensure that proper serv-
ices reach people involved in the crimi-
nal justice system. 
Finally, I thank our colleague, Rep-
resentative DAVID
TRONE, for cham-
pioning the companion bill in the 
House. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 3312, the Crisis Stabilization and 
Community Reentry Act of 2020. I was 
proud to introduce this House com-
panion bill, this bipartisan piece of leg-
islation, with Representatives RUTHER-
FORD, TRONE, ARMSTRONG, DEAN, and 
SCANLON. 
The Crisis Stabilization and Commu-
nity Reentry Act authorizes grants for 
State and local correctional facilities 
to partner with community mental 
health and behavioral health providers 
to provide clinical services for people 
with serious mental illness and sub-
stance abuse disorders. 
When I served as a district judge in 
southwestern Pennsylvania, many of 
those who came before my bench were 
suffering 
from 
untreated 
and 
undiagnosed mental illness. In fact, ac-
cording to a 2012 Bureau of Justice Sta-
tistics survey, approximately 1 in 7 
State and Federal prisoners, and 1 in 4 
jail inmates met the threshold for seri-
ous psychological distress in the 30 
days prior. 
S. 3312 ensures that we provide these 
individuals with treatment, suicide 
prevention, and tools for long-term re-
covery upon release from a correc-
tional facility. By ensuring continuity 
of mental healthcare, we can facilitate 
successful reentry, which is critical to 
reducing recidivism; in turn, improving 
public safety and saving taxpayer dol-
lars. 
I want to, again, thank my fellow 
sponsors in the House, as well as Sen-
ators CORNYN
and BLUMENTHAL, for 
prioritizing this important issue. 
I am proud to support this bipartisan, 
bicameral bill that will give law en-
forcement the tools that they need to 
keep our communities safe, while also 
ending the revolving door between pris-
on and the streets. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 3312, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1545 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague and good friend 
from Pennsylvania for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Crisis Stabilization and Commu-
nity Reentry Act of 2020. 
I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, as a 
former sheriff with over 40 years of ex-
perience in law enforcement, I under-
stand the issues people face as they 
leave and transition from incarceration 
to a free society. Throughout my time 
in law enforcement, I saw many indi-
viduals—too many individuals—re-of-
fend time and time again, often with 
the same offenses involving substance 
abuse and mental health issues. 
Part of the problem back then was, 
when a prisoner was released from 
State prison, literally all we gave them 
was a blue bag for their valuables and 
a bus ticket home. And we wondered 
why they failed and returned to a life 
of crime—not much for rehabilitation. 
So, when I became the sheriff of 
Jacksonville, I partnered with the 
Florida Secretary of Corrections and 
community groups to implement pro-
grams that provided continued treat-
ment and services to individuals during 
and after they left prison because those 
exiting prison systems face numerous 
challenges as they go back to their 
communities, often with little or no 
support from friends or family. 
As my colleague just mentioned, the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics calculates 
that one in seven individuals in State 
and Federal prisons, and one in four in-
dividuals in jails, experience serious 
psychological distress. Their battles 
with psychological distress and sub-
stance abuse do not stop when they 
exit prison. In fact, they are exacer-
bated upon their release. Indeed, dur-
ing this transition phase, that support 
is often needed the most. 
Today’s bipartisan legislation would 
streamline mental health and medical 
services for these individuals, pre-
venting a lapse of care between prison 
and society, and, instead, creating a 
continuum of care for those at greater 
risk of relapse. 
The Crisis Stabilization and Commu-
nity Reentry Act establishes a warm 
handoff of care between law enforce-
ment, community-based groups, and 
mental health specialists. The partner-
ship between law enforcement and 
community groups is critical as they 
both share a common goal to lower re-
cidivism and ensure people can thrive 
and succeed when they return back to 
their communities. 
By offering grants through the De-
partment of Justice, States and com-
munities would be able to provide 
medication-assisted treatment, coun-
seling, and other transition services 
that are prioritized for those who need 
it most. 
This bipartisan legislation is sup-
ported by the National Sheriffs’ Asso-
ciation, the Major Cities Chiefs Asso-
ciation, the National Council for Be-
havioral Health, and the National Alli-
ance on Mental Illness, and the Treat-
ment Advocacy Center.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7216 
December 16, 2020 
I am proud to support this initiative 
as a member of the congressional bi-
partisan Opioid Task Force, as a mem-
ber of the Mental Health Caucus, and 
also as a proud member of the Law En-
forcement Caucus, because as a sheriff, 
I have seen firsthand and know the suc-
cess a bill like this can accomplish. 
This bill is going to save lives, it is 
going to save money, and it is going to 
reduce crime. With a renewed focus on 
those people in greatest need, we can 
work together to ensure that pattern 
of recidivism can become a problem in 
the past rather than one that will be 
shouldered by future generations to 
come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
bill, which, again, Mr. Speaker, is 
going to save lives, save dollars, and 
reduce recidivism. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, in closing, once again, I would like 
to urge my colleagues to support S. 
3312, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, the Crisis 
Stabilization and Community Reentry 
Act of 2020 represents a significant step 
toward ensuring that incarcerated peo-
ple receive appropriate mental health 
and substance abuse care while in a 
correctional facility and that those 
services are available upon their re-
entry into the community. 
I am encouraged by the bipartisan 
and bicameral support for this bill. I, 
again, thank Representative TRONE, as 
well 
as 
Senators 
CORNYN
and 
BLUMENTHAL and my colleague from 
the Judiciary Committee, Representa-
tive RESCHENTHALER. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill today, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary, Committee, I rise 
in strong support of S. 3312, the ‘‘Crisis Sta-
bilization and Community Reentry Act,’’ bipar-
tisan legislation that ensures people experi-
encing a mental health crisis receive appro-
priate care while in a correctional facility. 
Specifically, the Crisis Stabilization and 
Community Reentry Act would authorize $10 
million in grants to communities to create col-
laborative programs involving justice agencies 
and community-based behavioral health pro-
viders, including Certified Community Behav-
ioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs). 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation addresses the 
challenges faced by many person during their 
period of incarceration and as they seek to re-
enter the community. 
This includes access to proper medication 
and additional training for law enforcement of-
ficers so they can address the needs of our 
most vulnerable individuals. 
The bill also calls for a warm handoff be-
tween law enforcement and community mental 
health clinics upon re-entry into the community 
to ensure the best possible start. 
It would also create a national technical as-
sistance center to serve communities around 
the country. 
Crisis Stabilization and Community Reentry 
Act grants would support community-level cri-
sis response programs, including collabo-
ratively designed crisis response services and 
technical support programs that promote medi-
cation adherence and continuity of care. 
This grant funding will also support targeted 
training programs related to medication adher-
ence and continuity of care; including the pur-
chase and use of long-acting antipsychotic 
medications to support adherence. 
Importantly, the infusion of funding will 
strengthen local agency and provider capacity 
to reduce suicides during incarceration. 
Finally, the legislation establishes a national 
technical assistance center to support justice 
and mental health agencies, community be-
havioral health providers, CCBHCs, and other 
stakeholders in developing training and treat-
ment approaches for justice-involved persons 
with mental illness, as well as payment strate-
gies that promote best-practices with respect 
to care for this vulnerable group of persons. 
This legislation is strongly supported by and 
has earned the endorsement of The National 
Council, which is another reason why I strong-
ly support this bipartisan, common-sense 
criminal justice reform and urge all Members 
to join me in voting to pass S. 3312, the Crisis 
Stabilization and Community Reentry Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
BASS) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 3312. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCAN-
LON). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 2174, the Missing Persons and Un-
identified Remains Act, a bipartisan 
measure aimed at assisting State and 
local governments to locate missing 
people and identify human remains. 
This bill not only authorizes grant 
funding to States and localities for 
such purposes, but it also improves the 
Federal Government’s data collection 
procedures and expands Customs and 
Border Protection’s response to the 
tragic rise in migrant deaths along our 
southern border. 
These changes bring much-needed fi-
nancial relief to local jurisdictions na-
tionwide and provide a modicum of dig-
nity and consolation to the families of 
those who have perished. 
Sadly, there is a pressing need for 
this legislation. The process by which 
States and localities and law enforce-
ment agencies must tackle these issues 
exacts a financial and emotional toll. 
When remains are found, their identi-
fication by State and local law enforce-
ment and medical examiners, often 
supported by crime and forensic labora-
tories, provides decedents and their 
survivors with dignity and respect. 
But bringing closure to these fami-
lies is costly. State and local entities 
must transport, preserve the remains, 
perform autopsies, attempt DNA test-
ing, and conduct forensic examina-
tions. These tasks can be particularly 
burdensome on small jurisdictions that 
often have to rely on State support to 
carry out these complex tasks. 
That is why the grant program that 
this bill authorizes is so important. 
While the need for this support is 
greatest along our southern border, the 
grant funds authorized by S. 2174 will 
support jurisdictions nationwide to 
carry on this critical work. 
S. 2174 also contains a number of pro-
visions that will strengthen the Fed-
eral Government’s efforts to identify 
missing and unidentified people. Nota-
bly, the bill would create a bridge be-
tween States and localities and a Fed-
eral database to help match reports of 
missing people with unidentified re-
mains. 
Importantly, the bill authorizes Cus-
toms and Border Protection to install 
up to 170 self-powering cellular relay 
rescue beacons along the southern bor-
der that will help stranded migrants 
call for help should they find them-
selves injured or in need of emergency 
services. 
A broad coalition of stakeholders 
have endorsed S. 2174, including the As-
sociation of State Criminal Investiga-
tive Agencies; the League of United 
Latin American Citizens, or LULAC; 
and the Christian Life Commission. 
This broad swath of support speaks to 
the need for the legislation and bol-
sters the bipartisan nature of the bill. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
VICENTE GONZALEZ for his leadership on 
this issue and his tireless work on be-
half of his House companion to this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, while I support this leg-
islation, I strongly believe in ensuring 
justice for all victims and their fami-
lies. I want to be absolutely clear that 
the continued crisis at our border re-
quires more from Congress. 
S. 2174 provides resources to law en-
forcement and related entities tasked 
with processing the remains of those 
who tragically died while making the 
dangerous journey to enter this coun-
try illegally. 
But Congress should be doing more to 
secure our borders and to prevent these 
tragic deaths in the first place. I am 
concerned about the burdens this bill 
places on our already strained U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection. 
Under this bill, CBP is charged with 
documenting information about indi-
viduals who died at the border, report-
ing on the causes of their deaths, and 
mapping their final locations. I truly 
fear that these reports may be used by 
open-border advocates to malign the 
men and women of the U.S. Border Pa-
trol when those advocates inevitably 
decide to play politics and start to 
argue that CBP is not doing enough to 
mitigate migrant deaths. 
In reality, to prevent future deaths 
at the border, we need to make it abso-
lutely clear that no one should embark 
on this dangerous journey because ille-
gal entry is simply not an option. We 
must fix our broken immigration sys-
tem, which incentivizes people to cross 
our border illegally. Strong border se-
curity and interior enforcement is the 
best way to stop loss of life. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1600 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GONZALEZ). 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in support of S. 2174, the 
Missing Persons and Unidentified Re-
mains Act, which gives local law en-
forcement the tools they need to ad-
dress a devastating issue that is drain-
ing resources in rural communities in 
south Texas and across the southwest 
border. 
Border communities are currently 
shouldering the cost of identifying and 
recovering the remains of migrants 
who tragically perished while migrat-
ing to the United States. This affects 
our citizens, ranchers, and farmers. 
The Missing Persons and Unidenti-
fied Remains Act is a bipartisan, bi-
cameral effort that will give local law

rural healthcare, education, broadband, 
and other key services that are, trag-
ically, needed in these areas. 
This is a critical bill to help address 
issues that are symptomatic of a larger 
problem. Unless we invest time and re-
sources to address the root cause of mi-
gration from Central America, we will 
continue to witness these tragic deaths 
in our border region. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Brooks County 
Sheriff Benny Martinez, Jim Hogg 
County Sheriff Erasmo Alarcon, Jr., 
and Duval County Sheriff Romeo Ra-
mirez, to name a few. These men have 
been on the front lines of this issue and 
continue their work to identify who 
has died. 
I also acknowledge the Southern Bor-
der Communities Coalition, the Church 
World Services, and the Texas Civil 
Rights Project for their work to raise 
awareness about this issue and help 
build support for this bill. Without the 
support of this large cross section of 
stakeholders, we would not be here 
passing this legislation today. 
For the families that have lost their 
loved ones, this bill is an opportunity 
to bring closure. I know many of you 
may not find the answers you seek, but 
there is a much better chance because 
of this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, in recognition of the bi-
partisan support for this bill, I request 
that all my colleagues vote in support 
of this important effort. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, in closing, while I support this bill, 
I think Congress must do more to se-
cure our borders. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the assistance provided 
by this bill will help bring peace of 
mind to the families of missing persons 
by taking meaningful steps to improve 
the identification of remains. 
I applaud the bipartisan and bi-
cameral support for this bill. I thank 
Representatives GONZALEZ
and HURD 
for their efforts in the House, as well as 
Senators CORNYN and HARRIS for cham-
pioning the bill in the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in support of this bill today, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary, Committee and a 
member representing a state on the nation’s 
southern border, I rise in strong support of S. 
2174, the ‘‘Missing Persons and Unidentified 
Remains Act of 2019,’’ sponsored by the sen-
ior senator from Texas, Sen. CORNYN, and 
Sen. KAMALA HARRIS, the next Vice-President 
of the United States and the first woman and 
person of color to win election to that high of-
fice. 
I support the Missing Persons and Unidenti-
fied Remains Act because it is bipartisan leg-
islation that will help prevent migrant deaths 
on the Southwest border and will help border 
counties and nonprofit organizations locate 
and identify missing migrants. 
Mr. Speaker, migrants seeking a better and 
safer life in the United States who attempt to 
cross the U.S.-Mexico border between ports of 
entry are often faced with difficult terrain and 
extremely dangerous conditions. 
The temperature in barren border sections 
of Arizona’s Sonoran Desert, for example, can 
reach over 104 degrees Fahrenheit in the 
summer and drop to below freezing in the win-
ter. 
Since 1998, the U.S. Border Patrol has re-
ported 7,505 migrant deaths on the border, 
most due to dehydration, drowning, and expo-
sure to extreme heat or cold. 
For more than two decades, over one mi-
grant a day has died while attempting to enter 
without authorization, a misdemeanor offense 
under Federal law. 
The actual number dead is likely much high-
er than that, as the statistics only report those 
who have been positively identified by border 
patrol agents. 
The bodies of migrants tragically lost during 
attempted border crossings become increas-
ingly difficult to identify after exposure to the 
desert for prolonged periods. 
The continuing loss of life on the border is 
unacceptable and allowing many of the dead 
to remain unidentified is inhumane, families of 
border crossers unsure of their loved ones’ 
fate and depriving them of the opportunity un-
able to say goodbye. 
The legislation before us would create 
grants for humanitarian and state actors to re-
port and identify missing persons and unidenti-
fied remains, including migrant border cross-
ers. 
The bill also provides resources for rescue 
beacons, which have been used effectively to 
rescue migrants who are in danger. 
Mr. Speaker, the Missing Persons and Un-
identified Remains Act would authorize the At-
torney General to provide grants to various 
entities to report, process, and identify missing 
persons and unidentified remains. 
Entities eligible for the grants would include 
state and local governments, humanitarian aid 
groups, nonprofit organizations, forensics and 
toxicology laboratories, and medical exam-
iners’ offices. 
This funding will improve reporting of miss-
ing persons to the Combined DNA Index Sys-
tem (CODIS) and the National Missing and 
Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), data-
bases used to identify border crossers who 
have lost their lives. 
Additionally, the legislation authorizes the 
purchase and implementation of up to 170 
self-powered ‘‘rescue beacons’’ in isolated 
border regions to prevent further migrant 
deaths. 
Rescue beacons are tools used by U.S. 
Border Patrol in desolate border areas to res-
cue migrants in distress. 
They are 30 to 40 feet tall, solar-powered, 
and satellite-connected. 
They are equipped with a 9–1–1 cellular 
relay, a strobe light, and a multilingual instruc-
tional placard to help migrants alert border pa-
trol personnel to a distress call. 
Not long ago, on Christmas Eve, 2017, a 
distress call from a rescue beacon allowed 
border patrol agents to rescue a migrant fam-
ily near Lukeville, Arizona, representing three 
of hundreds of lives that have been saved by 
the beacons since they were first implemented 
in the late 1990s. 
As of November 12, 2019, there were 34 
rescue beacons situated in desolate border 
areas; this bill would increase the total number 
of beacons by 600 percent. 
The bill clarifies privacy protections con-
cerning the use of biometric data in the report-
ing and identification of missing persons and 
unidentified remains and provides that any 
piece of biometric evidence handled by an en-
tity receiving grant funding be used for the 
sole purpose of identifying missing persons 
and unidentified remains. 
Finally, S. 2174 requires the Attorney Gen-
eral, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), 
and the Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) each to submit annual reports on use 
of grant funding and on programs imple-
mented to save migrant lives and identify the 
dead. 
Mr. Speaker, the Missing Persons and Un-
identified Remains Act would make an imme-
diate impact, both by saving lives on the bor-
der and by allowing the families of those who 
have lost loved ones to gain closure. 
I strongly support this bipartisan, common- 
sense reform that would enable the United 
States to lessen the loss of life on our south-
ern border and treat those dying or crossing 
between ports of entry with dignity and hu-
manity. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting to 
pass S. 2174, the Missing Persons and Un-
identified Remains Act of 2019. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, S. 2174, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to the extent pro-
vided in advance in appropriations Act,

appropriated 
for 
the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7220 
December 16, 2020 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘One Small 
Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 space-
craft launched from the John F. Kennedy 
Space Center carrying Neil A. Armstrong, 
Edwin E. ‘‘Buzz’’ Aldrin, Jr., and Michael 
Collins. 
(2) July 20, 2019, marked the 50th anniver-
sary of the date on which the Apollo 11 
spacecraft landed on the Moon and Neil Arm-
strong and Buzz Aldrin became the first hu-
mans to set foot on a celestial body off the 
Earth. 
(3) The landing of the Apollo 11 spacecraft 
and humanity’s first off-world footprints are 
achievements unparalleled in history, a di-
rect product of the work and perseverance of 
the more than 400,000 individuals who con-
tributed to the development of the Apollo 
missions on the shoulders of centuries of 
science and engineering pioneers from all 
corners of the world. 
(4) Among the thousands of individuals 
who have contributed to the achievements of 
the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration (in this section referred to as 
‘‘NASA’’) are African-American women such 
as Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, 
Mary Jackson, and Dr. Christine Darden, 
who made critical contributions to NASA 
space programs. Katherine Johnson worked 
at NASA for 35 years and calculated the tra-
jectory of the Apollo 11 landing and the tra-
jectories for the spaceflights of astronauts 
Alan Shepard and John Glenn. Katherine 
Johnson, together with many other individ-
uals 
the 
work 
of 
whom 
often 
went 
unacknowledged, helped broaden the scope of 
space travel and charted new frontiers for 
humanity’s exploration of space. 
(5) The landing of the Apollo 11 spacecraft 
was made on behalf of all humankind, and 
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were accom-
panied by messages of peace from the leaders 
of more than 70 countries. 
(6) The lunar landing sites of the Apollo 11 
spacecraft, the robotic spacecraft that pre-
ceded the Apollo 11 mission, and the crewed 
and robotic spacecraft that followed, are of 
outstanding universal value to humanity. 
(7) Such landing sites— 
(A) are the first archaeological sites with 
human activity that are not on Earth; 
(B) provide evidence of the first achieve-
ments of humankind in the realm of space 
travel and exploration; and 
(C) contain artifacts and other evidence of 
human exploration activities that remain a 
potential source of cultural, historical, ar-
chaeological, anthropological, scientific, and 
engineering knowledge. 
(8) On July 20, 2011, NASA published the 
voluntary guidance entitled ‘‘NASA’s Rec-
ommendations 
to 
Space-Faring 
Entities: 
How to Protect and Preserve the Historic 
and Scientific Value of U.S. Government 
Lunar Artifacts’’. 
(9) In March 2018, the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy published a report enti-
tled ‘‘Protecting & Preserving Apollo Pro-
gram Lunar Landing Sites & Artifacts’’. 
(10) Article one of the ‘‘Treaty on Prin-
ciples Governing the Activities of States in 
the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, in-
cluding the Moon and Other Celestial Bod-
ies,’’ commonly known as the ‘‘Outer Space 
Treaty,’’ states ‘‘[o]uter space, including the 
moon and other celestial bodies, shall be free 
for exploration and use by all States without 
discrimination of any kind, on a basis of 
equality and in accordance with inter-
national law, and there shall be free access 
to all areas of celestial bodies.’’ 
(11) Article eight of the Outer Space Trea-
ty states, ‘‘[a] State Party to the Treaty on 
whose registry an object launched into outer 
space is carried shall retain jurisdiction and 
control over such object, and over any per-
sonnel thereof, while in outer space or on a 
celestial 
body. 
Ownership 
of 
objects 
launched into outer space, including objects 
landed or constructed on a celestial body, 
and of their component parts, is not affected 
by their presence in outer space or on a ce-
lestial body or by their return to the Earth.’’ 
(12) Article nine of the Outer Space Treaty 
states, ‘‘[i]n the exploration and use of outer 
space, including the moon and other celes-
tial bodies, States Parties to the Treaty 
shall be guided by the principle of co-oper-
ation and mutual assistance and shall con-
duct all their activities in outer space, in-
cluding the moon and other celestial bodies, 
with due regard to the corresponding inter-
ests of all other States Parties to the Trea-
ty,’’ and continues, ‘‘[i]f a State Party to the 
Treaty has reason to believe that an activity 
or experiment planned by it or its nationals 
in outer space, including the moon and other 
celestial bodies, would cause potentially 
harmful interference with activities of other 
States Parties in the peaceful exploration 
and use of outer space, including the moon 
and other celestial bodies, it shall undertake 
appropriate international consultations be-
fore proceeding with any such activity or ex-
periment. A State Party to the Treaty which 
has reason to believe that an activity or ex-
periment planned by another State Party in 
outer space, including the moon and other 
celestial bodies, would cause potentially 
harmful interference with activities in the 
peaceful exploration and use of outer space, 
including the moon and other celestial bod-
ies, may request consultation concerning the 
activity or experiment.’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) as commercial enterprises and more 
countries acquire the ability to land on the 
Moon, it is necessary to encourage the devel-
opment of best practices to respect the prin-
ciple of due regard and to limit harmful in-
terference to the Apollo landing site arti-
facts in acknowledgment of the human effort 
and innovation they represent, as well as 
their archaeological, anthropological, histor-
ical, scientific, and engineering significance 
and value; and 
(2) the Administrator of the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration should 
continue to develop best practices to respect 
the principle of due regard and limit harmful 
interference with historic Apollo lunar land-
ing site artifacts. 
SEC. 3. BEST PRACTICES RELATED TO APOLLO 
HISTORIC LUNAR LANDING SITE AR-
TIFACTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion shall— 
(1) add the recommendations in subsection 
(b) as a condition or requirement to con-
tracts, grants, agreements, partnerships or 
other arrangements pertaining to lunar ac-
tivities carried out by, for, or in partnership 
with the National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration; 
(2) inform other relevant Federal agencies 
of the recommendations described in sub-
section (b); and 
(3) encourage the use of best practices, con-
sistent with the recommendations in sub-
section (b), by other relevant Federal agen-
cies. 
(b) 
RECOMMENDATIONS
DESCRIBED.—The 
recommendations described in this sub-
section are— 
(1) ‘‘NASA’s Recommendations to Space- 
Faring Entities: How to Protect and Pre-
serve the Historic and Scientific Value of 
U.S. Government Lunar Artifacts’’ issued by 
the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration on July 20, 2011, and updated on Oc-
tober 28, 2011; and 
(2) any successor recommendations, guide-
lines, best practices, or standards relating to 
the principle of due regard and the limita-
tion of harmful interference with Apollo 
landing site artifacts issued by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
(c) EXEMPTION.—The Administrator may 
waive the conditions or requirements from 
subsection (a)(1) as it applies to an indi-
vidual contract, grant, agreement, partner-
ship or other arrangement pertaining to 
lunar activities carried out by, for, or in 
partnership with the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration so long as— 
(1) such waiver is accompanied by a finding 
from the Administrator that carrying out 
the obligation of subsection (a)(1) would be 
unduly prohibitive to an activity or activi-
ties of legitimate and significant historical, 
archaeological, anthropological, scientific, 
or engineering value; and 
(2) the finding in paragraph (1) is provided 
to the Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation of the Senate not later 
than 30 days prior to the waiver taking ef-
fect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN) and 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legisla-
tive days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on S. 1694, the bill now under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
1694, the One Small Step to Protect 
Human Heritage in Space Act. 
First, I thank Senators PETERS and 
CRUZ for their leadership in the Senate 
on this important legislation, as well 
as Chairwoman JOHNSON and Ranking 
Member LUCAS and Subcommittee on 
Space and Aeronautics Ranking Mem-
ber BABIN, along with myself, for intro-
ducing the companion bill in the House 
of Representatives, which we are all co-
sponsors of. 
Mr. Speaker, I think we can all rec-
ognize the incredible accomplishments 
of the United States and our leadership 
in space and particularly when, 51 
years ago, our Nation sent Apollo 11 on 
its journey to the Moon and back, 
when some 650 million people tuned in 
to watch this historic first Moon land-
ing and see astronaut Neil Armstrong 
take humankind’s first step onto the 
lunar surface. 
Now, half a century later, the rugged 
boot print of Neil Armstrong’s and 
Buzz Aldrin’s feet and their walk on

the Moon remain at Tranquility Base. 
The first American flag to be planted 
on the Moon’s surface still marks the 
site of their landing, as do the sci-
entific hardware and other items that 
Armstrong and Aldrin left behind. 
These objects and others from the 
Apollo 
era 
tell 
the 
story 
of 
humankind’s extraordinary journey to 
the Moon. They have historical, ar-
chaeological, and inspirational value, 
and it is up to us to work to protect 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, following the 50th anni-
versary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, 
the One Small Step Act both recog-
nizes the achievements of the Apollo 
program and takes important measures 
to preserve our Nation’s human herit-
age in space, heritage such as the rover 
tracks, footprints, scientific experi-
ments, and spacecraft hardware, among 
others, at these lunar landing sites. 
Now, today, as more and more actors 
enter the space arena, including other 
nations and commercial entities with 
plans to carry out lunar activities, and 
we as a nation are working our way to 
send humans back to the Moon and 
then on to Mars as part of our deep 
space exploration program, it is more 
important today than ever that we 
take action to protect the historic arti-
facts that memorialize our first explo-
ration of the Moon and the advance-
ments achieved by the Apollo program. 
The One Small Step Act does this by 
taking timely action based on guidance 
from NASA. 
In 2011, our Nation’s space agency re-
leased recommendations on how to pre-
serve the first lunar landing sites. 
Their report states that future visits to 
the Apollo landing sites ‘‘could impose 
significant disturbance risks to these 
sites, thus potentially destroying irre-
placeable historic, scientific, and edu-
cational artifacts and materials.’’ 
The act we are considering today re-
quires action to follow this report’s 
recommendations. S. 1694, the One 
Small Step to Protect Human Heritage 
in Space Act, directs the NASA Admin-
istrator to include in its contracts, 
grants, and agreements lunar activities 
carried out by, for, or in partnership 
with conditions and requirements of its 
2011 recommendations about how to 
protect and preserve the historic and 
scientific value of U.S. Government 
lunar artifacts. 
The One Small Step Act further di-
rects the NASA Administrator to in-
form other relevant Federal agencies of 
the recommendations in the 2011 NASA 
report. 
The bill we are considering today 
makes changes to the language origi-
nally passed by the Senate last year. It 
recognizes NASA’s central role in 
working with partners on lunar activi-
ties and ensures they follow best prac-
tices regarding U.S. lunar landing site 
artifacts. This approach strikes an im-
portant balance in preserving lunar 
heritage sites, while not imposing reg-
ulatory framework. 
Further, this act builds on NASA’s 
work through the Artemis Accords to 
establish principles and set positive ex-
amples of responsible behavior, includ-
ing ‘‘to preserve outer space heritage, 
which they consider to comprise his-
torically significant human or robotic 
landing sites, artifacts, spacecraft, or 
other evidence of activity on celestial 
bodies in accordance with mutually de-
veloped standards and practices.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, NASA’s Apollo program 
was an inspiration to so many across 
this country and around the world. Its 
lunar landing artifacts are of cultural, 
historic, archaeological, and scientific 
significance for all of humanity, be-
yond just the United States. 
The Senate is prepared to pick up 
this version of their bill as soon as it 
passes the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the One Small Step to 
Protect Human Heritage in Space Act 
and to ensure that this important leg-
islation is enacted into law. 
Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, I 
thank the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs for helping us to bring this bill to 
the floor today, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

I appreciate your willingness to work coop-
eratively on this bill. I recognize that S. 1694 
contains provisions that fall within the ju-
risdiction of the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs. I appreciate that your Committee will 
waive further consideration of the bill and 
that this action is not a waiver of future ju-
risdictional claims over this subject matter. 
I will make sure to include our exchange of 
letters in the Congressional Record and will 
support the appointment of the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs conferees during any 
House-Senate conference. Thank you for 
your cooperation on this legislation. 
Sincerely,

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
Washington, DC, December 14, 2020. 
Hon. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
House Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN JOHNSON: I am writing 
to you concerning S. 1694, One Small Step to 
Protect Human Heritage in Space Act. I rec-
ognize that the bill contains provision that 
fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs. 
In an effort to work cooperatively and to 
expedite the consideration of the bill, the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs will waive re-
ferral of S. 1694. This, however, is not a waiv-
er of future jurisdictional claims by the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs over this leg-
islation or its subject matter. 
Thank you for agreeing to include our ex-
change of letters in the Congressional 
Record. Additionally, I ask that you support 
the appointment of Committee on Foreign 
Affairs conferees during any House-Senate 
conference convened on this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
1694, the One Small Step to Protect 
Human Heritage in Space Act. 
As an original cosponsor of the House 
companion bill, H.R. 3766, I certainly 
appreciate the importance of respect-
ing the historic significance of the 
Apollo missions. 
Mr. Speaker, I represent Johnson 
Space Center, or JSC, the home of 
NASA’s Mission Control and the men 
and women who made the Apollo mis-
sions possible. JSC has a long history 
of 
developing 
spacecraft 
and 
con-
ducting missions in space. 
From the very earliest Mercury mis-
sions that put the first Americans in 
space through Gemini and Apollo mis-
sions, as well as the space shuttle and 
International Space Station era, Hous-
ton has been the anchor of our Nation’s 
human spaceflight program. As NASA 
develops the next generation of human 
spaceflight capabilities, Houston and 
JSC will remain America’s tether to 
deep space. 
But while it is important to recog-
nize and respect the accomplishments 
of the past, we should not simply rest 
on our laurels. We have a lot more to 
do. 
Mr. Speaker, America does not look 
longingly in the rearview mirror of his-
tory. We stand on the shoulders of gi-
ants and carry the torch lit by those 
before us farther into the unknown. 
The bill before us correctly balances 
these two competing interests: respect-
ing the past and enabling the future. 
The Outer Space Treaty, drafted at 
the dawn of the space age, lays out im-
portant principles for all spacefaring 
nations. It calls for establishing the 
Principle of Due Regard, which re-
spects the activities of actors in space 
and creates a process for signatories to 
the treaty to undertake appropriate 
consultations before any action that 
would potentially cause harmful inter-
ference with another party to the trea-
ty. 
More importantly, the treaty estab-
lishes, in its opening article, the over-
arching principle that outer space, in-
cluding the Moon and other celestial 
bodies, shall be free for exploration and 
use by all states without discrimina-
tion of any kind on the basis of equal-
ity and in accordance with inter-
national law, and there shall be free ac-
cess to all areas of celestial bodies. 
This bill directs NASA to continue 
developing recommendations and best

NASA to include these recommenda-
tions in all contracts, grants, coopera-
tive agreements, and partnerships. 
The bill does not create any addi-
tional regulatory authority. Instead, 
the bill offers a carrot rather than a 
stick. If the private sector wants to le-
verage the vast experience and re-
sources that NASA offers, they simply 
must abide by NASA’s own internal 
policies. 
NASA is not a regulatory agency, 
and this bill does not grant any other 
agency any new power or mechanism 
to influence commercial space activi-
ties. This will allow our Nation’s 
emerging 
and 
vibrant 
commercial 
space sector to continue to innovate, 
while also respecting the rich archae-
ological, anthropological, historical, 
scientific, and engineering accomplish-
ments of the Apollo program. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Mem-
ber LUCAS, Senator PETERS, Senator 
CRUZ, and Chairwoman JOHNSON
for 
working with me to get this bill across 
the finish line. 
I also thank Chairwoman KENDRA 
HORN for her leadership over the last 2 
years. Her tenure as chairwoman for 
the Subcommittee on Space and Aero-
nautics was marked by significant 
change and accomplishments for our 
Nation’s space program. 
Her steady and fair treatment for all 
Members’ interests should serve as a 
shining example to this distinguished 
body. She will be missed, and I wish 
her the very, very best in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I recommend swift pas-
sage of this measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
b 1615 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by first 
thanking Ranking Member BABIN, as 
well 
as 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON
and 
Ranking Member LUCAS and Senators 
PETERS and CRUZ, for their work on 
this. 
Particularly, I thank Ranking Mem-
ber BABIN. It has truly been an honor 
to be able to work with his on these 
issues and to do so in a constructive 
way that advances policy that is good 
for the United States, for discovery, for 
innovation, and for our leadership in a 
way that we can come together. 
Space is one of those areas where it 
is and should be bipartisan, where we 
can come together for the best inter-
ests of our Nation, to continue to ad-
vance discovery and to encourage inno-
vation. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill does just that. 
It finds the right balance between pre-
serving the heritage of the Apollo era, 
for a reminder of what we can accom-
plish when we come together to work, 
to advance technology, to do what has 
never been done before, while not plac-
ing too much burden on our ability to 
move forward into the future and ad-
vance that discovery. 
Our Nation’s space program has long 
served as a source of inspiration and 
innovation and helped make sure that 
we, as a nation, are a leader in tech-
nology, innovation, and discovery. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage swift pas-
sage of this bill. I encourage all of my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yea,’’ and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to support House passage of S. 1694, 
the ‘‘One Small Step to Protect Human Herit-
age in Space Act.’’ 
I want to thank Senator PETERS and Senator 
CRUZ for initiating this legislation in the Sen-
ate. I also want to extend my appreciation to 
House Science Committee Ranking Member 
LUCAS, and Space and Aeronautics Sub-
committee Chairwoman HORN and Ranking 
Member BABIN for joining me in cosponsoring 
the House companion bill. We all share the 
goal of protecting human heritage in space, 
and it is fitting that we are working together to 
seek passage of the ‘‘One Small Step’’ legisla-
tion. 
More than 50 years ago, the world watched 
in awe as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin 
landed on the lunar surface and became the 
first humans to set foot on another planetary 
body. Prior to their successful landing, NASA 
implemented a series of tests, including 
robotic landings and human in-space test pro-
grams in preparation for the Apollo human 
landings. The culmination of those precursor 
efforts resulted in the safe and successful 
Apollo 11 lunar landing, a moment that 
changed the course of humanity. 
Apollo human landing missions explored a 
total of 6 sites on the Moon, leaving indicators 
of human presence, including rover tracks, 
footprints, and scientific experiments and 
spacecraft hardware, among other lunar land-
ing site artifacts. Those artifacts that remain 
imprinted in the lunar dust and on the surface 
of the Moon are cultural, historic, scientific, 
and archeological artifacts. The bill we are 
considering today, the ‘‘One Small Step to 
Protect Human Heritage in Space Act,’’ directs 
the NASA Administrator to take important ac-
tions toward preserving those artifacts. 
The United States led the way in lunar ex-
ploration with humans and we must also lead 
the way in setting examples and guiding re-
sponsible behaviors in outer space, including 
behaviors related to our lunar landing site arti-
facts. Congress and the American taxpayers 
made possible the United States’ historic and 
momentous Apollo lunar landings by author-
izing the program and investing four percent of 
the nation’s federal spending at the time to 
successfully carry it out. It is incumbent upon 
the House of Representatives to honor these 
historic lunar artifacts and to honor America’s 
investment and commitment to making the 
Apollo program a success. The direction in the 
One Small Step bill will put into law our com-
mitment toward preserving America’s human 
heritage in space. 
Apollo remains an inspiration; it brought the 
world together during a period of unique chal-
lenges and resulted in long-lasting benefits to 
Americans. As we plan and prepare to send 
Americans into deep space once again, and 
as other nations and actors become increas-
ingly capable of lunar activity, honoring and 
preserving Apollo’s historic and cultural signifi-
cance must be prioritized. In doing so, we cel-
ebrate American ingenuity and the awe-inspir-
ing, humanity-changing achievements of which 
we are capable. 
In closing, I want to also extend my support 
of S. 2472, the ‘‘Neil A. Armstrong Test Facil-
ity Act’’ to honor an American hero in our 
space program. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port passage of both S. 1694, the ‘‘One Small 
Step Act’’ and S. 2472, ‘‘the Neil A. Armstrong 
Test Facility Act.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. 
KENDRA S. HORN) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1694, 
as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to require the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration to add recommendations and 
inform other relevant agencies of infor-
mation relating to the principle of due 
regard and the limitation of harmful 
interference with Apollo landing site 
artifacts, and for other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
NEIL A. ARMSTRONG TEST 
FACILITY ACT 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the 
rules and pass the bill (S. 2472) to re-
designate the NASA John H. Glenn Re-
search Center at Plum Brook Station, 
Ohio, as the NASA John H. Glenn Re-
search Center at the Neil A. Armstrong 
Test Facility. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2472 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Neil A. Arm-
strong Test Facility Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds as follows: 
(1) Neil A. Armstrong, through his own def-
inition, was first and foremost as a test 
pilot. 
(2) A native of Wapakoneta, Ohio, Arm-
strong began his inspiring career in space ex-
ploration in Cleveland, Ohio, at what is now 
the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center. 
(3) Becoming the first human to land a 
spacecraft, and then set foot upon, the moon, 
represents the greatest dream of any test 
pilot. 
(4) Therefore, it is fitting that the premier 
aeronautics and space test station in Ohio 
should be renamed in his honor. 
SEC. 3. REDESIGNATION OF NASA JOHN H. 
GLENN RESEARCH CENTER AT PLUM 
BROOK STATION, OHIO, AS NASA 
JOHN H. GLENN RESEARCH CENTER 
AT THE NEIL A. ARMSTRONG TEST 
FACILITY. 
(a) REDESIGNATION.—The NASA John H. 
Glenn Research Center at Plum Brook Sta-
tion, Ohio, is hereby redesignated as the 
NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at the 
Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the station re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘NASA John H. Glenn 
Center at the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facil-
ity’’.

(c) SAVINGS.—Nothing in this section shall 
be construed to alter the relationship be-
tween the Plum Brook Station and the 
NASA John H. Glenn Research Center. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN) and 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GON-
ZALEZ) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legisla-
tive days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on S. 2472, the bill now under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 2472, the Neil A. Armstrong Test 
Facility Act. 
NASA astronaut and Apollo 11 space-
craft commander Neil Armstrong in-
spired all of humanity by taking ‘‘one 
small step for man, one giant leap for 
mankind,’’ touching down on a plan-
etary body hundreds of thousands of 
miles away as a part of the Apollo 11 
Moon landing mission. He is a national 
hero, a naval aviator, and one of many 
early pioneers of human space explo-
ration. 
Mr. 
Armstrong 
was 
born 
in 
Wapakoneta, Ohio, and started his 
NASA career in 1955, at the National 
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics— 
or NACA—Lewis Research Center, now 
the NASA Glenn Research Center. 
This legislation recognizes his sig-
nificant achievements, service, and 
contributions to the Nation by renam-
ing the NASA John H. Glenn Research 
Center at Plum Brook Station, Ohio, as 
the NASA John H. Glenn Research Cen-
ter at the Neil A. Armstrong Test Fa-
cility. 
NASA’s Plum Brook Station, located 
in Sandusky, Ohio, is home to world- 
class test facilities, where NASA and 
the international space community 
perform complex, critical ground tests 
of space vehicles and systems. 
Just this year, the Orion Multi-Pur-
pose Crew Vehicle finished its final 
campaign of environmental testing at 
Plum Brook Station as NASA prepares 
to return humans to deep space explo-
ration. 
Mr. Armstrong returned to his home 
State of Ohio after his service to the 
Nation and NASA. It is truly appro-
priate that a world-class aerospace test 
facility in the State of Ohio be named 
for a native son and one of the world’s 
most accomplished and dedicated pi-
lots. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on S. 2472, the Neil A. Armstrong Test 
Facility Act, to honor an American 
hero. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 2472, the Neil A. Armstrong Test 
Facility Act. This legislation would 
simply rename the NASA Plum Brook 
Station testing facility in Sandusky, 
Ohio, after Neil Armstrong. 
I want to first thank the esteemed 
Senator PORTMAN from the great State 
of Ohio for his work on this legislation 
and his many years of service to our 
State. 
Additionally, I want to thank my 
colleague from across the aisle, and an-
other fellow Ohioan, Congresswoman 
KAPTUR, for her efforts on this as well. 
Ms. KAPTUR
is a tremendous leader 
within our State. While we may be on 
opposite sides of the aisle, we have al-
ways found ways to work together on 
behalf of northern Ohio. 
On July 20, 1969, the world watched in 
wonder as Neil Armstrong became the 
first man to ever set foot on the Moon. 
Born in Wapakoneta, Ohio, Armstrong 
was the embodiment of a dedicated 
American. Serving as a naval aviator 
during the Korean war and partici-
pating in various test pilot programs, 
he was never one to shy away from a 
challenge. His courage was reflective of 
not only himself, but also that of the 
United States as we raced to beat So-
viet Russia to the Moon. It is why, 
today, we move to honor Armstrong’s 
legacy by renaming the Plum Brook 
Station at NASA’s John Glenn Re-
search Center to the Neil A. Armstrong 
Test Facility. 
A staple of northern Ohio and a con-
tinuing symbol of American ingenuity, 
Plum Brook is home to an array of 
projects for supporting our country’s 
endeavors into the unknown. Ranging 
from the world’s most powerful space 
environment simulators to full-scale 
testing 
for 
launch 
vehicles, 
Plum 
Brook is critical to NASA’s mission. 
Renaming Plum Brook after one of our 
State’s greatest heroes is a fitting way 
to memorialize Neil Armstrong’s leg-
acy within the State of Ohio and to in-
spire the next generation of leaders in 
our quest to explore the universe. 
This legislation has already passed 
the United States Senate via unani-
mous consent and has the full support 
of the entire Ohio congressional dele-
gation. 
I 
thank 
Senators 
PORTMAN
and 
BROWN on this bill. I also thank Chair-
woman JOHNSON and Ranking Member 
LUCAS for their help in bringing this 
bill to the floor today so that it can 
reach the President’s desk. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR). 
It is very fitting that we have another 
Ohioan to speak on this bill. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of S. 2472, the Neil A. Arm-
strong Test Facility Act. 
Congresswoman HORN, you have been 
a trusted and valued colleague and 
have ably served our Nation and your 
constituents. I want to express my 
deep appreciation for your assistance 
on today’s legislation and for your 
friendship as you served so honorably 
in this Congress. In the busy days be-
fore the end of the session, Ohio is 
truly grateful for your assistance in 
getting this bill to the finish line. We 
can’t thank you enough. 
Mr. Speaker, the Neil A. Armstrong 
Test Facility Act renames the NASA 
Plum Brook Station after a true Amer-
ican hero, who happened to be a Buck-
eye, an Ohioan. 
Our State is known for aviation, for 
its flight milestones, for its courageous 
heroes and inventors. The Plum Brook 
Station, located in Sandusky, Ohio, is 
a true asset to American excellence in 
space exploration. The facilities at the 
site are second to none. They contain 
the Space Environments Complex, with 
the world’s largest space test chamber. 
In its In-Space Propulsion building, 
it has a space chamber where you can 
fire an upper stage rocket. There is 
also a world-class clean-air hypersonic 
wind tunnel that even the Department 
of Defense didn’t know about, and a 
space chamber to test equipment to 
simulate planetary surface conditions. 
Imagine what someone like Neil 
Armstrong had to learn in order to be 
successful 
in 
that 
history-making 
flight. 
These capabilities enable our sci-
entists to prepare for the rigors of 
space exploration. 
The Plum Brook Station and test fa-
cility is a national asset. Today, it is 
being renamed after an American pio-
neer in human history. This year, 
Plum Brook Station finished testing 
the ORION spacecraft that will fly the 
Artemis I mission. This mission will 
eventually return a person to the 
Moon. 
Fifty-one years after Neil Armstrong 
captivated the world with his famous 
words that united humankind and al-
lowed us to dream for a common pur-
pose, the Nation turns our attention 
back to this test facility. How humble 
it was when he said, ‘‘One small step 
for man, one giant leap for mankind.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to express 
my deep appreciation to Representa-
tive ANTHONY GONZALEZ’s partnership 
on this bill. I am pleased to see him 
managing the Republican time today. I 
couldn’t be happier. He and his staff 
have been able to be collegial partners 
in securing a floor vote, and I thank 
him for that. I also thank our col-
leagues in the other body who have 
helped as well. 
I, along with the people of Ohio, are 
also extremely grateful to Chairwoman 
EDDIE
BERNICE
JOHNSON; 
Ranking 
Member LUCAS; our Senate colleagues, 
Senators BROWN
and PORTMAN, for 
their bicameral partnership on today’s 
legislation. This is the way Congress 
should work.

society 
and 
planet,

NASA test facility at Sandusky, Ohio, 
for Neil Armstrong offers a reminder to 
the world of our common purpose that 
can give us the giant leaps that lie 
ahead for humankind. Indeed, America 
must continue reaching for the stars 
and beyond. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 2472, the Neil A. Armstrong 
Test Facility Act. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Neil A. Arm-
strong Test Facility Act. The Buckeye 
State is honored to have been the home 
of American hero Neil Alden Arm-
strong. 
From the Wright brothers to the 
namesake of this legislation, Ohio 
boasts a rich history as leaders in the 
aerospace industry. 
Born in northwest Ohio, Neil Arm-
strong made history on July 21, 1969, as 
he uttered the words: ‘‘That’s one 
small step for man, one giant leap for 
mankind.’’ 
As the first human being to step foot 
on the Moon, Neil Armstrong inspired 
generations of Americans to literally 
follow in his footsteps. 
The United States owes a debt of 
gratitude to Mr. Armstrong for his 
service at NASA through multiple 
space exploration programs, as well as 
the U.S. Navy. 
The Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility 
Act would honor this American hero by 
bestowing his name on a critical NASA 
test facility station in Armstrong’s 
home State of Ohio. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in support of the Neil A. Arm-
strong Test Facility Act. 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Neil Armstrong’s heroism not only 
inspired a generation during the Apollo 
era, but also continues to inspire gen-
erations today as we look forward to 
the Artemis program. 
As America looks to send the first 
woman and next man back to the 
Moon, and as we look to Mars and be-
yond, renaming Plum Brook Station 
would be a great gesture of thanks for 
Armstrong’s service to the Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by 
thanking Mr. GONZALEZ for his work on 
this legislation and to say how much of 
a privilege it has been to be able to 
serve with him and work with him on 
the Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee and on the Space and Aero-
nautics Subcommittee. Indeed, this is 
one among many ways that we have 
proven that there is still the ability to 
work together to achieve common 
ends. 
To my colleague, Ms. KAPTUR from 
Ohio, thank you for your friendship 
and support. It is an honor to be able to 
work on issues that acknowledge and 
recognize 
the 
accomplishments 
of 
those heroes in the Apollo program 
who showed us what it means to come 
together to achieve something that has 
never been done before. 
b 1630 
As we recognize Neil Armstrong with 
this renaming of this facility, it is in 
honor of perhaps one of the most well- 
known quotes of all time. Because of 
the magnitude of that accomplishment, 
‘‘One small step for man, one giant 
leap for mankind,’’ was only made pos-
sible through the innovation and the 
effort of Neil Armstrong and so many 
others across this Nation who invested 
in the Apollo program. 
As an Oklahoman, although we can-
not claim Neil Armstrong but can 
claim a rich heritage in the aerospace 
arena and have astronauts at every 
phase of the Apollo program, I can 
think of no more appropriate recogni-
tion of Neil Armstrong than to name 
this facility after him. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

MARKING A DAY OF HOPE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
first of all, I want to, as a member of 
the Judiciary Committee, associate 
myself with the Missing Persons and 
Unidentified Remains Act of 2019, a 
very vital act for dealing with families 
who have lost loved ones, as well as the 
Crisis Stabilization and Community 
Reentry Act, S. 3312, which deals with 
helping people who are incarcerated 
adjust back to the community. 
I believe that we had a day of hope 
yesterday in Houston and around the 
world. In fact, it was not only yester-
day, but it was Monday. That is when 
the first vaccines began to come to the 
Nation. 
I went to the public hospital system, 
and I became part of UPS—that is, 
Pfizer vaccines that I was able to lift 
at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Hospital 
and then walk that vaccine to the 
pharmacy so that people would have 
hope. Then, I went to Ben Taub Hos-
pital—the 
public 
health 
system, 
again—and watched people from all 
backgrounds get vaccinated. 
This is a day of hope. We must con-
tinue, but we must continue to walk 
carefully. We must continue to stay 
distant, get testing, and wear our 
masks. 
There is hope. I am delighted to have 
been able to be there to say to our con-
stituents that there is hope, Madam 
Speaker. 
f 
JUSTICE FOR HARMONY ALLEN 
(Mr. MAST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, Har-
mony Allen is a veteran who was raped 
by her Air Force instructor while serv-
ing our country. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate justice for Harmony Allen. 
Now, for two decades, Harmony has 
been fighting for justice. Despite being 
convicted in 2017, her rapist was set 
free on a misconstrued technicality 
after the Nation’s highest military 
court disregarded Congress’ intent and 
incorrectly applied a 5-year statute of 
limitations on Harmony’s case. 
To fix this loophole, I introduced 
Harmony’s Law to ensure that con-
victed rapists are held accountable. I 
also worked with the Solicitor General 
in the Supreme Court to hear Har-
mony’s case and overturn this massive 
miscarriage of justice. 
Madam Speaker, last week, the Su-
preme Court ruled unanimously in Har-
mony Allen’s favor. The Court’s 8–0 de-
cision is a monumental one, and it 
serves a justice to Harmony that was 
long overdue. It also prevents the po-
tential early release of hundreds of 
convicted rapists, making this a vic-
tory for all victims of military sexual 
assault. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES ON BE-
HALF OF GEORGIA’S FIFTH CON-
GRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
(Mr. HALL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
alert the Chamber to three legislative 
activities that I am pursuing on behalf 
of Georgia’s Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict and a transportation and infra-
structure bill that I will be introducing 
later this week. 
The first will seek to eliminate quali-
fied immunity in police misconduct 
cases. The second piece of legislation is 
a constitutional amendment that con-
cerns forced labor. The third piece of 
legislation is one that would expunge 
all records of nonviolent offenders im-
pacted by the war on drugs and other 
various crime bills for any State and 
local government that is the recipient 
of Federal crime dollars. 
Later this week, I will be introducing 
legislation to commission a study on a 
vital transportation corridor in Geor-
gia, which would connect Campbellton 
Road to the businesses that are right 
to make greater metro Atlanta their 
home. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support my pieces of legisla-
tion and this project. 
f 
RECOGNIZING COHO BREWING 
COMPANY 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to recognize Coho Brewing 
Company in Cape May Court House in 
south Jersey. Coho was founded by 
Karen Buckingham in January 2019, in-
spired by her passion for craft beer. 
The brewery’s interior design is in-
spired by all our law enforcement and 
first responders. Karen hosted fund-
raisers and cornhole tournaments to 
raise money for the State police and K– 
9 units. Each of Coho’s beer cans has a

ers. She has also turned part of her 
tasting room into a brew-tique, which 
gives clothes and goods to those in 
need. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Karen for 
all she does for the south Jersey com-
munity and for our first responders, 
God bless Karen, God bless America, 
and God bless our first responders. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DR. PHIL ROE 
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the impressive 
career of my good friend, Dr. PHIL ROE, 
who is retiring at the end of this Con-
gress. 
A veteran himself, Dr. ROE served 
honorably as chairman and ranking 
member on the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee, where he worked on preventing 
veteran suicide, increasing patient ac-
cess to care, and providing agency ac-
countability. 
Dr. ROE has been a strong leader of 
our GOP Doctors Caucus, providing 
strong insight, a steady hand, and a lot 
of patience as we have debated critical 
legislation affecting patients and pro-
viders. 
Over the years, I have been blessed 
enough to call Dr. ROE a dear friend. 
He showed me what life in rural Ten-
nessee was like; he has regaled us with 
his guitar skills; he has made us laugh; 
and he has been a source of wisdom for 
all of us. 
It has also been a pleasure to get to 
know his beloved wife, Clarinda, who I 
know is looking forward to having him 
around more often. 
I know that I can speak on behalf of 
all of my colleagues when I say thank 
you for your service, PHIL. Good luck 
in retirement, and God bless you.

IN RECOGNITION OF SENATOR 
LAMAR ALEXANDER 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of Senator 
LAMAR
ALEXANDER, who is retiring 
from the United States Senate after 18 
years in office. My friend, Senator 
ALEXANDER, has led a strong career 
representing Tennesseeans at the State 
and Federal levels. 
Senator ALEXANDER was Governor of 
Tennessee from 1979 to 1987. As Gov-
ernor, he revamped the economy by 
cutting regulations to attract new 
businesses and jobs and reformed our 
public education curriculum. 
Following two terms as Governor, 
Senator ALEXANDER was president of 
the University of Tennessee and served 
as Secretary of Education in President 
George Herbert Walker Bush’s adminis-
tration. He returned to elected office in 
2002, winning Tennessee’s open U.S. 
Senate seat. 
In 
Congress, 
Senator 
ALEXANDER 
demonstrated strong leadership and 
legislated in the best interests of all 
Tennesseeans. 
Among 
his 
many 
achievements are the SUPPORT Act, 
comprehensive legislation to fight the 
opioid epidemic, and, as of late, the 
Great American Outdoors Act, which 
will preserve the Smokies and other 
national parks for years to come. 
Senator ALEXANDER and I are fond of 
the same quote from our friend Alex 
Haley: ‘‘Find the good and praise it.’’ 
There is a lot of good in LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER, and I thank him for his many 
years of service. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
MCBATH). Members are reminded to put 
on their masks. 
f 
AMERICA’S CONFIDENCE IN OUR 
ELECTORAL SYSTEM 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
America’s confidence in our electoral 
system has suffered an egregious blow 
this cycle. Of the many credible con-
cerns surrounding this year’s process, 
Dominion voting machines have neared 
the top of the list. From crashing dur-
ing a recount in Georgia to several er-
rors in Antrim County, Michigan, it is 
clear that Dominion’s authority on 
vote counting is in question. There 
needs to be a fully independent audit of 
Dominion’s voting machines. 
No, this is not an attempt to over-
turn an election; this is about making 
sure, moving forward, all Americans 
have faith in our elections, whether it 
is the constitutional actions setting 
election process in place or trans-
parency in the tabulation of the vote. 
Madam Speaker, my Republican col-
leagues and I have stressed that every 
legal vote must be counted, but we 
must also ensure those who count our 
votes, whether a person or a machine, 
are also fully complying with the law.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE 
AND 
CORRUPTION—MESSAGE 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116– 
173) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13818 of December 20, 2017, is to 
continue in effect beyond December 20, 
2020. 
The 
prevalence 
and 
severity 
of 
human rights abuse and corruption 
that have their source, in whole or in 
substantial part, outside the United 
States, continue to threaten the sta-
bility of international political and 
economic systems. Human rights abuse 
and corruption undermine the values 
that form an essential foundation of 
stable, secure, and functioning soci-
eties; have devastating impacts on in-
dividuals; weaken democratic institu-
tions; degrade the rule of law; perpet-
uate violent conflicts; facilitate the ac-
tivities of dangerous persons; under-
mine economic markets; and continue 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United 
States. Therefore, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13818 with respect to serious 
human rights abuse and corruption.

NEW HOLLAND AGRICULTURE 
125TH ANNIVERSARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a local business in 
my congressional district and con-
gratulate them as they celebrate their 
125th anniversary this year. 
To my constituents in the 11th Dis-
trict, when they hear the words ‘‘New 
Holland,’’ they often think of a great 
borough with about 6,000 residents lo-
cated in Eastern Lancaster County. 
But when others across the globe hear 
the words ‘‘New Holland,’’ it often 
means to them high quality, agricul-
tural machinery. 
New Holland Agriculture, which is a 
brand of CNH Industrial, was founded 
125 years ago in New Holland, Pennsyl-
vania, by a gentleman named Abe Zim-
merman. What Mr. Zimmerman began 
as a small machine shop in 1895 would 
eventually grow to become a global 
leader in agricultural equipment, from 
tractors to harvesting. 
The company became known for 
technological innovations, particularly

the development of the first automatic 
hay baler nearly 80 years ago. The com-
pany’s hay tools plant still operates in 
New 
Holland, 
Pennsylvania, 
where 
they produce approximately 30 models 
of balers, which are exported to 45 
countries around the world. New Hol-
land Agriculture has 800 dealerships in 
North America and nearly 5,000 more 
across the globe. 
Madam Speaker, I am particularly 
thankful for and proud of the hard 
work by the company’s nearly 1,000 
full-time employees in New Holland, 
Pennsylvania. Many of them I know 
personally and are some of my closest 
friends. 
I particularly want to mention my 
father-in-law, Jim Greiner, who spent 
his entire career at New Holland. He 
retired after 45 years as a project engi-
neer and had a great career there. 
I am thankful for how New Holland 
has given back to the community, par-
ticularly working to support STEM 
education in my congressional district. 
The organization recently hosted an 
externship program for local educators 
to provide a hands-on learning experi-
ence for teachers to see how New Hol-
land’s employees use STEM every day 
at the workplace. 
Madam Speaker, I offer my congratu-
lations to New Holland North America 
on their 125th anniversary. I am cer-
tain that Mr. Abe Zimmerman, who 
founded the company so long ago, 
could not have envisioned how the 
business would grow to support agri-
culture across the globe but would be 
very, very proud of what his company 
has accomplished. I wish them contin-
ued success as they navigate the next 
125 years in business and thank them 
for having a positive impact on the 
community that I represent. 
IN HONOR OF FRONTLINE WORKERS AND 
SERVICEMEMBERS 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
also rise today to honor the brave men 
and women in my district and across 
America who have been working hard 
to combat COVID–19. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, 
doctors, nurses, and medical profes-
sionals in hospitals, long-term care fa-
cilities, and community health centers 
have committed long hours away from 
their families to put the needs of oth-
ers before their own. They have worked 
without pause to keep our community 
healthy and to care for those in need. 
Throughout this pandemic, farmers, 
producers, truck drivers, and manufac-
turers have also worked without pause 
to provide for us all. The farmers and 
agriculture producers in my district 
adjusted to changes in supply chain op-
erations to keep our Nation fed. Truck 
drivers and logistics professionals en-
sured deliveries of essential goods and 
personal protective equipment were de-
livered, and delivered on time. 
Educators have also faced significant 
challenges this year, but they have 
continued to provide students with the 
best education possible in these cir-
cumstances. Adapting to the chal-
lenges of remote instruction, educators 
in school districts had to adjust quick-
ly to make sure students are still re-
ceiving that quality education. Amer-
ica’s teachers always rise to the occa-
sion, and they have done so once again. 
Madam Speaker, we also honor the 
brave servicemembers in the United 
States Armed Forces who are away 
from their families for this upcoming 
holiday season, and we pray for their 
continued safety. We must also hold 
their families in our hearts as they, 
too, serve our Nation with bravery 
while their loved ones are abroad. 
Madam Speaker, lastly, I thank ev-
eryone here in the Capitol working 
hard to put safety measures in place so 
we can be here in Washington to serve 
and work for the American people. I 
know that brighter days lie ahead for 
our neighbors and nations. Thera-
peutics and vaccines are going to help 
us turn the corner on this virus. 
Please keep your loved ones and 
neighbors in mind. Wear a mask, wash 
your 
hands, 
and 
practice 
social 
distancing this holiday season. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Thereupon (at 5 o’clock and 54 min-

No. 213 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Spirit, our hope for the years 
to come, today, teach our lawmakers 
to do things Your way, embracing Your 
precepts and walking in Your path. In-
spire them to trust You for safety. As 
they receive guidance from You and 
follow Your leading, replace anxiety 
with calm, confusion with clarity, and 
pessimism with hope. 
Lord, guide our Senators to find 
workable solutions for the problems of 
our Nation and world. 
You are our God, and the good things 
we have come from You. 
We pray in Your marvelous Name. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
ALEXANDER). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 1 minute in 
morning business, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
IOWA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we 
all know that, without a doubt, 2020 
has been a difficult year. But for me it 
was an important year to continue 
fighting for Iowans and listening to 
Iowans. 
This year I completed my 40th year 
of my 99 county meetings that included 
a Q&A in every one of those counties. 
This annual tradition keeps me in 
touch with the grassroots of Iowa and 
allows me to bring their ideas to the 
policymaking tables here in Wash-
ington, DC. 
With all the twists and turns this 
year took, my county meetings were 
more beneficial than ever. I just want 
to mention a couple of these twists and 
turns. 
The twist and turns involved the big 
devastating windstorm we called the 
‘‘derecho’’ that went through central 
Iowa, destroying 800,000 acres of crops. 
Those twists and turns involved deal-
ing with all the issues coming from 
COVID–19. 
One thing I know for sure, Iowans are 
very resilient people. So I look forward 
to continuing these county meetings 
and the Q&A’s involved with them at 
the beginning of the new year. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Democratic leader and I worked into 
the evening alongside the Speaker of 
the House and the House Republican 
leader. We made major headway toward 
hammering out a targeted pandemic 
relief package that would be able to 
pass both Chambers with bipartisan 
majorities. We committed to con-
tinuing these urgent discussions until 
we have an agreement, and we agreed 
we will not leave town until we have 
made law. 
The American people need more help. 
It is that simple. Further targeted re-
lief is now months overdue. We need 
vaccine distribution money. We need to 
re-up the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram to save jobs. We need to continue 
to provide for laid-off Americans. Con-
gressional leaders on both sides are 
going to keep working until we get this 
done. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO PAT ROBERTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on a completely different matter, it is 
both my honor and unhappy duty to 
offer one more parting tribute to a dis-
tinguished Senator who will leave us at 
the end of the 116th Congress. 
My good friend the senior Senator 
from Kansas, PAT
ROBERTS, is pre-
paring to close out the longest congres-
sional tenure the Sunflower State has 
ever seen. 
When PAT arrived in Washington as a 
freshman House Member, he was a 
young man among giants—Byrd, Ste-
vens, Dole. But over the past four dec-
ades, the name ‘‘Roberts’’ has come to 
define its own iconic brand of heart-
land statesmanship. 
PAT is the first to admit he didn’t es-
tablish that name all on his own. He 
inherited it from another great Kan-
san. Charles Wesley Roberts was a ma-
rine, a journalist, and a leader in Re-
publican politics. 
So get ready to experience some deja 
vu, because at age 16, our future col-
league got to attend the 1952 conven-
tion that nominated Kansas’s own Gen-
eral Eisenhower. That early taste of 
politics planted a seed. 
PAT
earned his own Marine Corps 
commission. In fact, he served with the 
first contingent to return to Iwo Jima, 
where his father had fought 15 years 
earlier.

December 16, 2020 
Then he decided to ply another fam-
ily trade. Like generations of Roberts 
men, including an abolitionist news-
paperman three generations back, he 
took up journalism. 
Only then did PAT bring his talents 
here to Washington, to Senator Frank 
Carlson’s office. He impressed, and by 
the next time his next boss, Keith 
Sebelius, announced his retirement, 
PAT was running out of excuses not to 
go on and run himself. 
Campaigning in Kansas’s ‘‘Big First’’ 
district required countless road trips 
across nearly half the State. But lis-
tening to neighbors, building relation-
ships, and earning trust came natu-
rally. PAT’s district elected him no 
fewer than eight times, and the whole 
State sent him here to the Senate an-
other four. 
Before long, every small-time diner 
in Western Kansas was filled with peo-
ple who saw PAT not just as an elected 
official but as a trusted friend. The 
way I hear it, you walk into a res-
taurant or a coffee shop with PAT, and 
you budget about 15 minutes of con-
versation before you even make it to 
your table. Many of those conversa-
tions revolve around one particular 
line of work. There is a reason why no 
less an authority than Bob Dole would 
later dub this man ‘‘Mr. Agriculture.’’ 
When Republicans retook the House 
majority in 1994, they knew who had to 
chair the Ag Committee. The rest is 
history for our colleague, for his State, 
and for farmers and growers all across 
America. 
The 1996 farm bill that PAT shep-
herded included ‘‘Freedom to Farm,’’ 
landmark legislation that set a new 
tone for the way American farmers 
would compete in a global market. 
Now, today, we know that PAT would 
later become the only American ever 
to chair the Ag Committee in both the 
Senate and the House. But on this side 
of the dome, he tackled a few other as-
signments first. 
PAT
had already helped clean up 
some ethics messes in the House, and 
so his discretion and integrity landed 
him on the Senate Ethics Committee. 
In short order, he was chairing it. 
Then came the Intelligence Com-
mittee gavel and, with it, more sen-
sitive challenges. Our trusted marine 
had to conduct oversight and ask hard 
questions in the wake of September 11 
and the Iraq invasion. He oversaw es-
sential reports and helped shape re-
form. 
But we couldn’t keep the Kansan 
away from his top passion for long. So 
it wasn’t long before Mr. Agriculture 
was chairing the committee with the 
most importance of all to his constitu-
ents back in Kansas. 
Chairman ROBERTS has been a con-
stant voice and a consistent champion 
for the men and women of this country 
who get their hands dirty, grow crops, 
raise livestock, and, as our colleague 
likes to say, ‘‘feed a troubled and hun-
gry world.’’ 
Even in polarized times, the Ag Com-
mittee has largely remained a haven 
for bipartisan work. That is partly the 
nature of an issue set where divisions 
tend to be more regional than ideolog-
ical, but it is also because of the 
skilled, thoughtful, and genial con-
sensus-builder we have had at the cen-
ter of the dais. 
Two years ago, because of the chair-
man, the farm bill conference report 
passed by an overwhelming margin of 
87 to 13—87 votes for our farm bill. By 
my count, that was the eighth farm 
bill our colleague had a hand in. It 
turns out that experience actually 
matters, or, as our colleague likes to 
say, ‘‘it takes a long time to do big 
things’’—‘‘a 
long 
time 
to 
do 
big 
things.’’ 
That is true of multiyear farm bills. 
It is true of the advances PAT has 
pushed forward on geopolitical issues 
like food security. It is true of other 
important projects that our friend has 
taken under his wing, like the crusade 
to make certain that President Eisen-
hower receives the monument he de-
served here in Washington. This pan-
demic may have changed the unveiling 
ceremonies this year, but it is only fit-
ting that Ike persevered. That is 
thanks to a quarter century of work 
from PAT ROBERTS. 
There is a reason the people of Kan-
sas have rehired our colleague time 
after time, and it is not just for his en-
tertaining wit, although I will have 
more on that subject in just a moment. 
It is because, when their Senator sees a 
way to strengthen his home State or 
his country, he keeps at it until he gets 
it done. 
In short, PAT has spent decades mak-
ing sure that it is not just places like 
Manhattan, NY, but also Manhattan, 
KS, that get the attention and support 
they deserve. 
In fact, thanks to PAT, Manhattan, 
KS, is the home for our Nation’s his-
toric new National Bio and Agro-De-
fense Facility. He played the long 
game and spent years getting his State 
ready to make the pitch. This state-of- 
the-art research facility will come on-
line at K-State, next to another impor-
tant research facility that happens to 
be named Pat Roberts Hall. 
He has looked out for Fort Riley and 
its essential missions. He has helped 
devastated communities like Greens-
burg rebuild after disaster. In every 
way imaginable, Kansas has had its 
champion. 
PAT’s voice has been a powerful pres-
ence in these halls. But in rare mo-
ments when he hasn’t been getting re-
sults, the voice has, of course, been 
making us laugh. PAT is one of the best 
humored Senators in a long time—not 
funny, humorous. 
It is not just PAT’s quick wit or his 
punch lines themselves that take the 
cake. The best part is just the unpre-
tentious fearlessness with which he 
will go after a good laugh in almost 
any situation. 
It is a daunting task to try to convey 
PAT’s winsome humor as a third party. 
It is a package deal. The words, the 
voice, the expression all work together. 
But I will share just one example. 
Several years back, PAT and I were 
both attending a formal dinner hon-
oring Bob Dole and Howard Baker. PAT 
had been asked to offer some remarks 
in Bob’s honor. Apparently, he decided 
a conventional toast would just simply 
not cut it; the fancy evening would 
need shaking up. 
It so happened that PAT had recently 
attended Kennedy Center Honors that 
honored Neil Diamond. So when PAT 
took the podium at that dinner, with 
that famous tune ‘‘Sweet Caroline’’ 
stuck in his head, he wound up leading 
the audience in the world premiere 
sing-along of the new original song 
‘‘Sweet Robert Dole . . . Bob, Bob, 
Bob.’’ A little unusual, sure, but some-
how it was the perfect contribution. It 
literally brought the house down. 
So we have here a senior Senator 
from a State that expects greatness 
from its representatives. They gave 
America a young man from Abilene 
who led the fight against tyranny in 
Europe and became President. They 
gave us another son from Russell who 
fought in that fight, came home, be-
came Senate majority leader, and ran 
for President. 
But let’s add one more name to that 
distinguished company. Historians cer-
tainly will. There is a third Kansas 
statesman from Holton who belongs on 
that list: Eisenhower, Dole, and ROB-
ERTS. 
In his own farewell speech, PAT 
quoted his first boss in Washington, 
Senator Carlson. He said: 
There are no self-made men or women in 
public office. It is your friends and family 
who make you what you are. 
Well, more than all the bills he has 
passed, above all the outcomes he 
willed into reality, PAT says his family 
is his ‘‘crowning achievement.’’ So I 
must 
conclude 
by 
thanking 
PAT’s 
‘‘magnolia blossom,’’ Franki, for her 
generosity in lending PAT to us all 
these years and everything she has 
done to make it possible. And the Sen-
ate thanks his three kids and their 
eight grandchildren for making do with 
less of our colleague’s time than they 
deserve. 
So PAT, we know we are going to 
laugh less without you. I am afraid we 
are not going to get as much done 
without you. 
But you have made us better for 
knowing you, the Senate better for 
having you, and Kansas and your coun-
try so much better for your devoted 
service. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as we 
rapidly approach the end of the session, 
Senators are working in earnest to fin-
ish a bipartisan government funding 
bill as well as an emergency Federal 
relief package. 
Over the past several weeks, the bi-
partisan Gang of 8 came together to 
provide a framework for an agreement 
on 
emergency 
COVID 
relief. 
That 
framework has been the basis of discus-
sions between the four congressional 
leaders: 
Speaker 
PELOSI, 
Leader 
MCCARTHY, Leader MCCONNELL, and 
myself. Secretary Mnuchin has been in 
our talks as well, representing the 
President. 
Yesterday we had two very long and 
very productive meetings. Our final 
discussion 
stretched 
late 
into 
the 
evening. 
As we race the clock to reach a final 
accord before the end of the year, we 
are close to an agreement. It is not a 
done deal yet, but we are very close. 
Now, for Democrats, this has always 
been about getting the American peo-
ple the relief they need in the time of 
an acute national crisis, of an emer-
gency to so many Americans. This has 
been about delivering a lifeline to 
Americans who were laid off, through 
no fault of their own, families strug-
gling to pay the rent and put food on 
the table, small businesses hanging on 
for dear life. 
This has been about saving our 
schools, our healthcare system, and de-
livering the resources to produce and 
distribute the vaccine that should fi-
nally, finally help our country turn the 
corner and defeat this evil disease. 
We are on the precipice of achieving 
these goals. We Democrats would have 
liked to go considerably further, but 
this won’t be the last time Congress 
speaks on COVID relief. Right now, we 
must address this emergency over the 
short term. But make no mistake, we 
will work in the future to provide addi-
tional relief as the country requires, 
but we need to provide a platform to 
build on. We need to address this emer-
gency right now. 
At the end of one of the most dif-
ficult years in recent American his-
tory, a vaccine has given us all a rea-
son for hope. Let’s give the country an-
other reason. The finish line is in sight. 
Everyone wants to get this done. Let’s 
push through the few final meters and 
deliver the outcome that the American 
people very much need. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

TECHNOLOGY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yester-
day afternoon, the Commerce Sub-
committee on Communications, Tech-
nology, Innovation, and the Internet 
held our final hearing of the 116th Con-
gress. The title of yesterday’s hearing 
was ‘‘Betting on the Rest: Expanding 
American 
Entrepreneurship 
Outside 
Traditional Hubs,’’ and it focused on 
examining where venture capital is 
being invested in this country and 
where it is not, with an eye to explor-
ing ways to expand investment to 
other parts of the country. 
Over the past 50 years, venture cap-
ital has come to play an essential role 
in 
advancing 
American 
entrepreneurism. Venture capitalists 
have provided key funding for startups 
that have gone on to become some of 
America’s most profitable companies. 
Many of the technologies and services 
we rely on today would not be around 
if venture capitalists hadn’t been will-
ing to take a risk on innovation. 
However, venture capital investment 
in the United States has traditionally 
been highly concentrated in certain 
areas of the country. In 2019, Cali-
fornia-based companies received 50 per-
cent of all venture-backed investment 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
Just 
three 
States—California, 
New 
York, 
and 
Massachusetts—accounted for almost 
75 percent of all venture-backed invest-
ment in the country. 
There are a lot of valid reasons for 
this investment concentration. How-
ever, this geographic imbalance also 
means that a majority of regions with-
in the United States are often shut out 
from the kind of investment that cre-
ates jobs, revitalizes communities, and 
enables the pursuit of the American 
dream. 
Without greater access to capital in 
underserved regions, the flow of talent, 
wealth, and opportunity will continue 
to move to only a handful of coastal 
cities, and the full reach and diversity 
of American ingenuity will go unreal-
ized. Fortunately, there are a lot of in-
dividuals in the private sector who are 
already working to address this issue 
and expand venture-backed investment 
to other areas of the United States, 
and we had the opportunity to hear 
from some of them yesterday. I was 
very grateful for their input. We were 
very pleased to have a South Dakota 
entrepreneur among our panelists. 
I am committed to making sure that 
the Federal Government serves as a 
help, not a hindrance, to the expansion 
of venture capital investment. I took 
the reins of the Commerce Commit-
tee’s Subcommittee on Communica-
tions, Technology, Innovation, and the 
Internet at the start of the 116th Con-
gress, and I am very proud of the work 
we have done over the past 2 years. We 
have had a very active Congress, hold-
ing eight hearings in Washington, DC, 
as well as a hearing in my home State 
of South Dakota. These hearings have 
explored everything from broadband in-
vestment in rural America to the way 
the social media companies filter infor-
mation on their platforms. 
I have introduced several bills over 
the past 2 years that have been in-
formed by our work at the committee, 
including the PACT Act, the TRACED 
Act, the Telecommunications Skilled 
Workforce Act, and the STREAMLINE 
Small Cell Deployment Act. 
A priority of mine over the past sev-
eral years has been ensuring that 
America stays at the head of the next 
wave of internet technology, which is 
5G. In addition to the tremendous tech-
nological benefits that will result from 
5G, staying at the forefront of the 5G 
revolution will bring tremendous eco-
nomic investment and create a lot of 
great American jobs. 
I spent a lot of time working on this 
issue when I was chairman of the Com-
merce Committee, and heading up the 
Communications, Technology, Innova-
tion, and the Internet Subcommittee in 
this Congress has allowed me to con-
tinue to focus on 5G. 
Last year, I introduced the STREAM-
LINE Small Cell Deployment Act along 
with the ranking member of the sub-
committee, Senator SCHATZ. Our legis-
lation would help expedite the deploy-
ment of the small cells that are a key 
part of 5G infrastructure. 
This year, I introduced the Tele-
communications Skilled Workforce Act 
to address another part of the 5G equa-
tion, and that is ensuring that we have 
the workforce in place to handle the 
demands of installing and maintaining 
5G technology. 
As a resident of a rural State, ensur-
ing access to broadband internet in 
rural communities has long been a pri-
ority of mine. I introduced legislation 
this year to direct funds from radio 
spectrum auctions to expand rural 
broadband access. I am continuing my 
work to ensure that rural communities 
get access to 5G technology.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7514 
December 16, 2020 
Now, 5G has the potential to offer 
tremendous benefits to rural commu-
nities, from expanded access to tele-
health services to precision agriculture 
technologies, and I am committed to 
ensuring that rural communities are 
not left behind in the 5G revolution. 
Pretty much every American has 
been forced to deal with annoying and 
illegal robocalls. These calls are a 
major nuisance, and too often, they are 
more than a nuisance. Every day, vul-
nerable Americans fall prey to even 
more sophisticated scammers and have 
money or their identities stolen. 
I have worked on this issue for years, 
and in 2019 I introduced the Telephone 
Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement 
and Deterrence Act, or the TRACED 
Act, 
along 
with 
Senator 
MARKEY. 
While this legislation won’t stop every 
robocall, the TRACED Act provides 
tools to discourage illegal robocalls, 
protect consumers, and crack down on 
offenders. I am very proud that last De-
cember, the President signed our legis-
lation into law. 
More and more, Americans get news 
and information from social media 
sites, and particularly during this past 
election cycle, a lot of questions have 
arisen about the ways that social 
media platforms are filtering the infor-
mation that we see. Internet platforms 
have actively cultivated the notion 
that they are merely providing the 
technology for people to communicate 
and to share their thoughts and ideas, 
but the reality is somewhat different. 
Sites like Facebook and Twitter make 
use of sophisticated content-modera-
tion 
tools, 
algorithms, 
and 
rec-
ommendation engines to shape the con-
tent that we see on these platforms. 
Now, content moderation can cer-
tainly improve the user experience. 
Most of us would prefer that YouTube 
recommend videos that match our in-
terest. The problem is, the content 
moderation has been and largely con-
tinues to be a black box, with con-
sumers having little or no idea how the 
information they see has been shaped 
by the sites they are visiting. 
Last year, I chaired a subcommittee 
hearing on this issue, and the informa-
tion we gathered helped inform two 
pieces of bipartisan legislation that I 
introduced this Congress—the Filter 
Bubble Transparency Act and the Plat-
form Accountability and Consumer 
Transparency Act, or the PACT Act. 
Both of these bills would increase 
transparency around the content-mod-
eration process so that users have a 
better sense of how the information 
presented to them is being filtered. The 
Filter Bubble Transparency Act and 
the PACT Act go a long way toward 
making social media and other sites 
more accountable to consumers, and I 
will continue to work to advance these 
legislative efforts here in the Senate. 
I am grateful to have had the oppor-
tunity to chair this subcommittee over 
the past Congress and for the oppor-
tunity it has given me to work on the 
important issues and the legislation 
that I have mentioned. I want to thank 
the subcommittee’s ranking member, 
Senator SCHATZ, for all the work he 
has done to make our committee so ef-
fective. I look forward to continuing to 
work with all my subcommittee col-
leagues to advance the 5G revolution, 
address the challenges presented by the 
internet age, and to make life better 
for the American people. 
I yield the floor.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The Senator from Oregon. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2828 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in a mo-
ment, I am going to make a unanimous 
consent request on a piece of legisla-
tion on which my Eastern Oregon con-
stituents have done an extraordinary 
job with respect to building a coalition 
that brings people together on a con-
tentious issue. It deserves enormous 
credit, and I will describe their efforts 
here shortly. 
I also want to thank, as we begin, 
Senator BARRASSO. Senator BARRASSO 
will be taking on a new role in January 
on the Senate Committee on Energy 
and Natural Resources. He and I have 
worked together often, and I have ap-
preciated his talking with me on this 
matter as he begins to look to his new 
duties in January. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 2828, the Malheur Com-
munity Empowerment for the Owyhee 
Act, and the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration; further, that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed; and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I do appre-
ciate the work the Senator from Or-
egon has done on this public lands bill. 
I know the amount of effort that has 
gone into this legislation is significant. 
Locally driven public lands bills take 
an incredible amount of time to get 
right. 
This legislation has gone through in-
tensive local stakeholder involvement, 
very similar to what we have done in 
Wyoming with the Wyoming Public 
Lands Initiative in my home State. 
The Wyoming Public Lands Initiative 
was 
spearheaded 
by 
our 
Wyoming 
County 
Commissioners 
Association. 
This initiative was started in order to 
resolve, through local negotiations, the 
status of so-called ‘‘temporary’’ wilder-
ness study areas in Wyoming that have 
now, seemingly, become permanent. 
I recognize and understand that pub-
lic lands negotiations often result in 
compromise. This give-and-take is a 
good thing, for it lets people closest to 
the issue have a significant voice. So I 
appreciate the efforts the stakeholders 
on the ground in Oregon have made to 
get this bill to where it is today. How-
ever, I believe additional work is still 
needed. 
I would let my friend from Oregon 
know that I will work with him and 
any other Senators with public lands 
issues before the Committee on Energy 
and Natural Resources. We may not al-
ways agree on a given outcome, but I 
am committed to having those discus-
sions with Members of this body. 
For this reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I know 
my colleague does have other business 
that he has to get to, but before he at-
tends to that, I just want to thank him 
for spending time with me already on 
this issue. I am going to outline the ex-
traordinary effort that was made by 
my constituents. 
I think we all know—and I am going 
to discuss it—that in the West, very 
often, citizens feel nobody is listening 
to them, that nobody cares about 
them. The Senator and I have talked 
about this. This is kind of a question 
of, How do you empower them with a 
framework that can help them but also 
serve as a model for the country? 
So a big thanks to my colleague, and 
I am looking forward to working with 
him on this and other matters next 
year. 
What Senator BARRASSO and I are 
discussing is the Malheur Community 
Empowerment for the Owyhee Act, 
known in our part of the county as the 
Malheur CEO Act. The bill has been in 
the works since late 2018. Back then, 
when a group of ranchers and business 
people who live in Malheur County, 
OR, came to see me, they came to talk 
about this incredible part of Oregon 
they call home. It is wide open coun-
try, and not many people live there, 
but those who do want to make sure 
they have a say in how it is going to be 
preserved and managed for the future. 
When I say this bill has been in the 
works since 2018, that is not the whole 
story, because the fact is that the 
groundwork for this bill has been in 
the making for decades, and it is only 
recently that an incredible coalition of 
Oregonians from across the political 
spectrum has come together to make it 
possible for us to propose this legisla-
tion. 
As I touched on with Senator BAR-
RASSO, in rural areas of the West, like 
Malheur County, there is often a feel-
ing that people from thousands of 
miles away, particularly in DC, think 
that they somehow know better than 
rural citizens about what is good for 
those rural communities. I guess I 
would sum it up as: In rural areas, 
there is the sense that somehow, often, 
elites just look down on them; that no-
body is listening; that people in power

December 16, 2020 
consider them kind of simple cowboys 
who care little about saving land, air, 
and water. 
Now, I have townhall meetings in 
every county in Oregon. I had 970 of 
them until earlier this spring when we 
couldn’t do them in person due to the 
pandemic. So we started doing them 
virtually. I know from all of those 
townhall meetings that constituents in 
Eastern Oregon are actually working 
every day to try to propose common-
sense, practical policies to preserve 
special places for their kids and their 
grandkids. They know that they are 
working for all Americans because all 
Americans own public lands. Eastern 
Oregonians believe—and I think it is a 
very powerful point—that nobody cares 
more about protecting Oregon’s nat-
ural treasures than those who live 
every day in those communities and 
are always thinking about what the fu-
ture 
is 
for 
their 
kids 
and 
their 
grandkids. 
I will repeat that. 
Folks in rural Oregon know that the 
land is public land, that it belongs to 
all Americans, and they know that 
their communities’ futures depend on 
keeping the lands healthy and usable. 
The ranchers of Malheur County want 
to be active participants in improving 
and keeping the ecological health of 
our public lands, and with this legisla-
tion that we are discussing today, they 
will have a real shot at doing just that. 
The fact is that, in some parts of the 
West, there have been bad actors who 
have abused the land for their own gain 
and flouted the law in a dangerous 
way. For example, in 2016, a heavily 
armed group of extremists that was not 
from Oregon, led by members of the 
Bundy family, stormed the Malheur 
National Wildlife Refuge and occupied 
it for weeks. There was a standoff that 
people all over the country saw, be-
tween them and Federal, State, and 
local law enforcement. There was one 
death. Further south, in Nevada, the 
Bundys have not only stolen millions 
of dollars’ worth of grazing fees from 
the American people, they also basi-
cally pushed aside basic environmental 
standards laid out by the Taylor Graz-
ing Act, leading to degraded land-
scapes. 
Now, in Malheur County, just a few 
hours of wide open spaces east of the 
Malheur National Wildlife Refuge that 
the extremists took over, our ranchers 
and our small business people, to their 
great credit, said: We are going to take 
a different path, a better path. In 
Malheur County, you don’t have the 
Bundys breaking the law. Our Malheur 
County ranchers are committed to 
being better and doing better, but that 
doesn’t mean they aren’t skeptical of 
people coming in and changing the 
rules when it comes to public lands 
surrounding their communities. 
So, in 2018, the Owyhee Basin Stew-
ardship Coalition from Malheur County 
came to Washington to meet with me. 
Senator BARRASSO will be interested in 
this. This group of ranchers and small 
business people came to me with a very 
improbable request for a Democratic 
U.S. Senator: Would I be willing to 
work with them to pass land manage-
ment legislation that could serve as an 
alternative to a designation as a na-
tional monument? 
I thought this would be the point my 
colleagues would be interested in: I 
asked one member of the group if they 
had come to me because they thought 
I might take leave of my senses and 
say yes to their request. When I asked 
them, the person who was looking at 
me said: Yes, that is what we thought, 
Ron. 
Looming over the discussion was the 
history of this wonderful part of East-
ern Oregon. I am not going to take my 
colleagues through a long discussion of 
the history of the Taylor Grazing Act, 
as it goes all the way back to 1932. So 
I will just start with the fact that in 
this area, Malheur County makes up 
most of the Vale District of the Bureau 
of Land Management, which, of course, 
is part of the Department of the Inte-
rior. The Vale District was the poster 
child for ‘‘scientific grazing manage-
ment’’ in the 1960s and early 1970s 
under the Taylor Grazing Act. Did it 
live up to its potential? I would say it 
didn’t because its efforts really were 
not adequately funded, and it lacked 
the 
consistent 
monitoring 
or 
the 
adaptive management needed to make 
it work on the ground, and that raises 
the question: What results are really at 
issue? 
The Taylor Grazing Act is about 
turning cattle out onto public lands 
and attempting to assure they don’t 
destroy the land, but where is the act 
when it comes to fighting invasive 
weeds and actually improving soil 
health 
and 
responding 
to 
climate 
change and the effects of rangeland 
fires? In looking at what happened over 
the decades—the 1930s, the 1960s, the 
1970s—this bill says we are going to an-
swer those questions for 2020. 
The Owyhee Basin Stewardship Coa-
lition from Malheur County wanted to 
work together. I was glad that they 
came with their improbable request. I 
said we have got one chance here on 
our watch to bring people together, to 
come up with a sensible proposal. And 
when they indicated they wanted to 
work with me, I basically said: How 
could I refuse? 
Knowing the violence that can erupt 
in the West when people become closed 
off, when people just refuse to talk, 
that is when you have a prescription 
for trouble. As long as we are talking, 
as long as we are coming together, as 
long as we are sitting with each other 
and maybe just having a coffee, a tuna 
fish sandwich, you have an opportunity 
to come up with solutions. That is why 
I agreed to this. 
I agreed, in effect, to try to match 
the courage of these ranchers and busi-
ness people in coming forward, and I 
said: If they are going to be willing to 
think through how to do this, I am 
going to join them. 
Now, the other area I want to touch 
on is—I said at the get-go and I think 
this has implications for dealing with 
public lands in the West. I said that 
there has got to be three requirements 
to help us all protect the land and pre-
serve the ranching way of life. 
First, we would have to bring every-
body to the table—environmentalists, 
ranchers, local folks, and we would 
have to bring some of the folks from 
the more metropolitan area as well. 
That is because, in effect, when I said 
that, they said: OK. You know your 
way around legislation. We will try to 
find common ground. 
And there is common ground on the 
key question. In every nook and cran-
ny of Oregon, there are people who care 
about our natural treasures in the 
Owyhee Canyonlands. Malheur County 
may keep its clock on Idaho time, but 
it is enormously loved all across our 
State. In my view, that alone ought to 
be a reason, after decades and decades 
of differences with respect to how to 
manage these treasures, that alone is a 
reason to work together. 
The second rule of our discussions 
was all about we weren’t going to liti-
gate this with the press and outside 
groups every time somebody had a lit-
tle question, any kind of a dispute. So, 
in effect, we had set it up so that other 
groups, environmental and ranchers, 
there was going to be a lot of oppor-
tunity for folks to have their say. 
And the third rule was that there 
would be an understanding that we 
would respect our environmental laws. 
That was also very pivotal. So, in 
March of 2019, we got our group to-
gether in the conference room at the 
National Guard Armory in Ontario, 
OR, and those were the things that we 
wanted to start with that we thought 
gave us a chance to build this coalition 
that could lead to passing legislation 
to manage these treasures. So we got 
ranchers, 
environmentalists, 
local 
businesses, and we meet, essentially, 
every other Monday for months and 
months. 
I also want to thank the Bureau of 
Land Management and the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, Oregon State 
parks, fish and wildlife management 
agencies, local Tribe representatives, 
all of whom put in enormous amounts 
of time offering information, expertise, 
and good will. I met with local county 
officials, 
as 
well, 
relearning 
their 
thoughts with respect to roads and 
water infrastructure and their most 
important local economic needs. So 
that is what really led to this legisla-
tion. 
Finally, what we said is that we have 
to make sure that people have an op-
portunity to also talk, sort of, a little 
bit offline. So after these sessions, we 
always found a way to make it to a 
gathering place somewhere where peo-
ple could just have a soda, perhaps 
something a little bit stronger, and we 
could just take the time informally to 
talk about what we thought the future 
was for this incredible part of the 
world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7516 
December 16, 2020 
Now, in closing up, I want to mention 
that I think land designation discus-
sions pit people against one another in 
the West if you do it the traditional 
sort of way. We needed some unity if 
we were going to come together on a 
bill. So that is why we wanted to make 
sure everybody had a shared under-
standing of how this would be ad-
dressed. 
I particularly want at this time to 
commend Sarah Bittleman, who is sit-
ting here with me, who, month after 
month after month, call after call after 
call, email after email after email, al-
ways tried to keep this on focus. 
I also want to mention at this time 
our inspiration was the late Mary 
Gautreaux, who was in our office for 
over two decades. She was the spirit of 
this effort. She lived in Portland. Yet 
she was beloved—beloved—by the peo-
ple of rural Oregon, the people of 
Malheur County. So with Sarah and 
Mary as the energy behind this, we 
really set out to build this coalition, 
which has gotten us to this point. It 
was a coalition driven on the fact that 
people would take the time to do this 
right. 
When I brought it to the attention of 
Senator BARRASSO, who obviously will 
play a key role in the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee next year, 
the first thing he wanted to hear about 
was the kind of groundwork that had 
been laid for local input, for local 
stakeholders. I described to him much 
of what we have been talking about. 
So I introduced the Malheur CEO Act 
in November of 2019. It was part of a 
legislative hearing in 2020, and let me 
just very quickly describe a couple of 
elements of it. It works this way: It in-
cludes range land management en-
hancements, loop roads to focus tourist 
travel and build the local economy, and 
about a million acres of wilderness des-
ignation. It also moves around a mil-
lion acres of land now being studied 
into multiple-use management. 
The bill implements a few key strate-
gies: a plan to let ranchers do range 
improvements, irrigation systems, re-
moving water-sucking juniper, and re-
placing invasive weeds with native 
grasses and improve the ecological 
health of the range land. 
So here are the pictures to my left. 
The first is a picture of rangeland 
being overrun by weeds. The second 
shows rangeland in a native, healthy 
condition. 
Now, the bill also establishes a 
Malheur Community Empowerment for 
the Owyhee advisory group so on an on-
going basis it can advise BLM on land 
management. And the bill also provides 
substantial funding for the BLM so it 
can finish environmental soil surveys 
and carry out environmental policies 
associated with this bill and monitor 
the implementation of the bill. 
The bill includes funding for the 
study and designation of three loop 
roads designed to improve the visitor 
experience, keep visitors out of trou-
ble, and drive more traffic to the small 
retail businesses, which I think we all 
understand desperately—desperately— 
need our attention. 
I also want to thank at this point, 
while I am on floor, Senator GRASSLEY. 
He and I have led the bipartisan effort 
on the Finance Committee. 
I see Senator MANCHIN
here. He 
knows how strongly we feel about get-
ting the small businesses the deduct-
ibility 
associated 
with 
these 
PPP 
loans. 
I bring this up only by way of saying 
that we are grateful to Senator GRASS-
LEY for working with me. He is the 
chair of the Finance Committee. I am 
the ranking Democrat, but Senator 
MANCHIN and others deserve credit for 
helping us get that proposal moving, 
and we made it clear we have to get 
that in before we go home. Part of it is 
our concern for the small retail busi-
nesses that we saw in the Owyhee. 
Finally, the bill provides for amen-
ities at the Owyhee Reservoir with a 
marina. That is also good for the local 
economy. Recreation is a big economic 
engine in our part of the world. 
And the last point I will just mention 
is the bill is a compromise. Everybody 
had to make some concessions. 
There are folks who feel that the en-
vironmental groups got too much here. 
There are folks who feel the ranchers 
and the small business people got too 
much. But the fact is, all sides said: We 
have some core values and some core 
priorities. Let’s see if we can address 
the core values and core priorities on 
both sides of this so that this spectac-
ular portion of Eastern Oregon could be 
protected and preserved and we could 
respect and empower the people who 
call it home and work so hard to make 
a living there. 
Finally, I ask unanimous consent to 
put into the RECORD the names of all 
the people who worked so hard on this 
effort—our Owyhee Basin Stewardship 
Coalition. They are ranchers; there are 
folks on various kinds of environ-
mental organizations and groups; and 
they deserve incredible credit for being 
willing to put in the time and effort on 
something that seemed so improbable. 
Finally, I want to thank my partner 
here in the Senate, Senator MERKLEY. 
He has been terrific as we worked on 
this. We both share a love of the land 
in Eastern Oregon. 
Now it is up to the U.S. Senate to get 
this passed. It isn’t going to happen 
today, unfortunately, but I want the 
Senate to know I am going to stay at 
it until this gets done. I think it will 
be of enormous benefit for rural Or-
egon. I think it will be of enormous 
benefit for our State, and I think it 
will be a model for how our country 
brings people together, particularly as 
it relates to issues where we have been 
polarized in the past. 
There being no objection, the mate-

Mr. WYDEN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr.

Mr. 
President, 
I 
would like permission to basically be 
able to complete my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I want 
to start by thanking all of the Mem-
bers—and I mean all of the Members— 
who have worked so diligently to 
produce this product. 
This is the product we produced with 
the so-called Gang of 8, but it turned 
into a bigger gang than that because 
more and more people want to work in 
a bipartisan way in the Senate. I have 
said: It is alive and well; we just have 
to exercise it more. 
We did that. We brought over the bi-
cameral group, the Problem Solvers, 
and they were tremendously instru-
mental in being involved in this proc-
ess. I am so pleased to have that bi-
cameral work, bipartisan work. We 
need more of it, and we are going to ba-
sically demand more of it. But with 
this product right now, as the ‘‘four 
corners’’ are working, this is the tem-
plate they have used. 
Leader SCHUMER has said that this is 
what they have used because the legis-
lative language has already been pro-
duced. There might be some tweaks to 
it, but there are so many people. 
Let me tell you how it started. My 
dear friend Senator DURBIN
is here. 
After the election, we called each other 
back and forth, a few of us, saying: 
Something has to be done. Nothing is 
moving. People are hurting. 
We heard that all during the election, 
and they couldn’t figure out why we 
hadn’t done anything. I had no good ex-
planation because, basically, the two 
leaders on both sides of the aisle were 
locked, and I said we didn’t know how 
to break it. The only way we could 
break it is by doing something showing 
we could come together. 
We did that. We did that in a way 
that—we had a dinner. Senator MARK 
WARNER from Virginia said: Let’s have 
a dinner. Senator LISA
MURKOWSKI 
said: Come to my house. So we go to

LISA
MURKOWSKI’s house, and there 
were eight of us. We had four R’s and 
four D’s, and we grew from there. On 
our side, there was Senator MARK WAR-
NER, Senator DICK
DURBIN, Senator 
JEAN SHAHEEN, myself. On the Repub-
lican side, there was Senator LISA 
MURKOWSKI, Senator SUSAN
COLLINS, 
Senator BILL
CASSIDY, and Senator 
MITT
ROMNEY. From there, it grew. 
Then we brought the bipartisan group 
over—Congressman JOSH
GOTTHEIMER 
and Congressman TOM REED and the 
Problem Solvers—and we kept growing 
from there, and we had more Senators 
coming in. So we got input from every 
quadrant we could possibly in order to 
do what we did, but it took quite a 
while. 
The biggest hurdle we had was how 
much we could agree that we need as 
an emergency. Democrats were at 1.2, 
1.3. The Republicans were at 5 or 6. We 
couldn’t move off of that, and it took 
us a while to say: Let’s look at emer-
gencies and everything that basically 
is going to run out of time in December 
and be nullified. People are going to 
lose their lifelines. 
We started putting all those figures 
together and came up with the $900 bil-
lion figure. That is where 908 came 
from. I understand they are still at the 
900, which we appreciate very much. I 
am hopeful that we can help break that 
deadlock and be a part of this, but 
there is so much more that has to be 
done, and there is so much more need 
out there that will need to be done. We 
must all come together behind Presi-
dent-Elect Joe Biden to make sure that 
we do it and look at the need of Amer-
ica, not the greed of America. 
Trust me, if you are sending checks, 
everyone is in line, but if you are real-
ly getting to the people who are on the 
frontline, they need it. 
I have people who have said and we 
have all said: We are not going to go 
home. We can’t go home until we do 
something. Guess what. If we don’t do 
anything, a lot of people won’t have a 
home to go to this holiday season. 
They truly won’t. They are being evict-
ed. They are losing their lifeline. They 
are losing their shelter. 
Food assistance—my goodness. Think 
about all the people in need. Have you 
ever seen the lines of people whom you 
have never seen before, who have never 
been to a food give-out or a food bank 
or a food line? 
These are the things that we ad-
dressed, and we addressed them in the 
most compassionate way. That is our 
job. 
I understand that our four corners 
are very close to a deal. I think it will 
be done. I know it will be done because 
we have to do it. Failure is not an op-
tion. So we are going to work very 
hard to continue to do that. 
Let me tell you, we have unemploy-
ment assistance for people who lost 
their jobs, food assistance, shelter as-
sistance. We have small business debt 
relief. We have student loan forbear-
ance. We have so many other things, 
and people are depending on us. We in-
clude $300 a week. I am not sure what 
the final bill will be on the safety net 
realm there. We had $13 billion for food 
assistance. We had SNAP benefits, 
helping people who are falling into that 
chasm of welfare who need help, and 
$35 billion for healthcare providers. We 
had 20 percent set aside for the rural 
hospitals and rural clinics. We had $16 
billion for testing and tracing, and I 
understand they are increasing that, 
which is needed; $12 billion for commu-
nity development financial institu-
tions; $5 billion for emergency funding 
for substance abuse prevention and 
treatment and mental health services; 
$82 billion for education, including $20 
billion for basically higher education; 
$10 billion to support childcare; $10 bil-
lion for broadband, including $3 billion 
for education and distance learning; 
and $45 billion in emergency funding 
for transportation. There are so many 
needs that we have out there. 
We have a second bill too. I am un-
derstanding that was a little bit more 
controversial, but I can tell you one 
thing: There was no controversy on the 
first 
bill—$748 
billion; 
100 
percent 
Democrats and Republicans—all had 
input to make that happen. 
Again, I say the staffs have worked a 
yeoman’s job over day and night for 
the last month. They have done a ter-
rific job. 
Now for State and local, I really be-
lieve personally there is a need because 
I have seen the frontline workers and 
the amount of revenue we might lose 
for people not to have those services 
that are essential. They are depending 
on it. We might lose it because the 
States or the localities don’t have the 
revenue. So we have to come back and 
address that. If we don’t do it now, we 
have to do it as soon as President-Elect 
Joe Biden takes over, look at it again 
to try to help those in need, and we 
will do that. 
So we have come together. We have 
come together. Also what we are say-
ing is the money that the Governors 
and everyone has left over, they are 
going to be able to have extensions on 
how that is used, and we have some di-
rection. 
We want to make sure that the locals 
have some opportunities too. Some of 
the local communities and local mu-
nicipalities or local counties did not 
get the revenue that they should have 
gotten in the first tranche of money, so 
we are hoping that is taken care of 
also. 
So all these protections that we put 
in there, we are trying to help. We are 
trying to get a pathway forward to 
bring our economy back, to make sure 
we are able to. But this is the product 
that got it all going, and this is the 
group of people who made it happen, 
the bipartisan group who worked day 
and night, and I can’t thank them 
more. I couldn’t be more proud to be 
with a group whom I consider true 
Americans who stepped up to the plate 
and got something done when we didn’t 
think it could be done. 
But, again, I want to thank all of my 
colleagues, my Republican colleagues 
and friends and Democratic colleagues 
who worked so hard, and everybody 
who is going to benefit. I think it can 
be a merry Christmas. It can be a much 
happier Christmas for sure when we all 
go home and look at our constituents 
and say ‘‘We have done everything we 
can to get you through the most chal-
lenging time,’’ which will be the first 
quarter of 2021, and this bill is an emer-
gency bill that goes through April 1. 
I would note—oh, we are ready to go.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1762 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
much ink has been spilled the past few 
years over the threat of foreign influ-
ence in our politics. It is a topic I have 
spoken about many times on this floor. 
This issue has become highly politi-
cized, but it requires bipartisan agree-
ment to address. 
It is increasingly clear that our ad-
versaries will stop at nothing to influ-
ence political discourse in our country. 
We can all agree that there is a real 
need to improve our Nation’s foreign 
influence laws. Fortunately, the Sen-
ate has a real opportunity today to fi-
nally do something about it. 
In 1938, Congress passed the Foreign 
Agents Registration Act, referred to by 
the acronym ‘‘FARA.’’ It did this in 
1938 to expose Nazi propaganda and 
identify foreign attempts to influence 
policymakers and the American public. 
The bill was last updated in 1966. And it 
now requires those who lobby on behalf 
of foreign governments and interests to 
register their affiliations and activities 
with the Justice Department. 
FARA reflects the fundamental prin-
ciple that transparency brings account-
ability. Until recently, however, the 
law had been seldom used, and few on K 
Street paid much attention to the ne-
cessity of registering under this act if 
they were lobbying for a foreign coun-
try. Of course, that was not due to a 
lack of foreign influence efforts. 
Given 
FARA’s 
important 
trans-
parency provisions, its lack of enforce-
ment was shocking to me, and that is 
the problem that these several legisla-
tors sponsoring this legislation are try-
ing to correct. 
I first raised concerns about lack-
luster FARA enforcement in April 2015 
when a former Clinton White House 
staffer and a lawyer for a Georgian po-
litical party failed to register as for-
eign agents. I also raised concerns 
about work for Ukrainians by Paul 
Manafort and the Podesta Group. I 
raised concerns when the firm behind 
the discredited Steele dossier failed to 
register for its lobbying work to repeal 
U.S. sanctions against Russia. I even 
subpoenaed Manafort to testify at a 
Judiciary Committee hearing on lax 
FARA enforcement. I praised Mueller 
for dusting off the law that had been 
ignored for so long. 
I have conducted FARA oversight 
without regard to power, party, or 
privilege. Americans expect equal ap-
plication of the law no matter which 
political party someone is affiliated 
with. I am an equal opportunity over-
seer. FARA ought to be better enforced 
and equally enforced. That is why my 
office worked thoroughly to expose 
holes in the existing FARA law and 
found ways to shore it up. 
My bipartisan Foreign Agents Disclo-
sure and Registration Enhancement 
Act is the product of years of oversight 
and policy work. The bill requires the 
Justice Department, for the first time, 
to craft a comprehensive FARA en-
forcement strategy and to release advi-
sory opinions to promote transparency. 
It gives FARA investigators new tools, 
including civil investigative demand 
authority, to help identify violations. 
The bill appropriately limits those in 
the Justice Department who can use 
this authority, and it provides essen-
tial due process protections. In fact, it 
is based on identical authorities in the 
False Claims Act, which I sponsored 
now 35 years ago, which for years has 
helped to root out waste, fraud, and 
abuse. 
The bill also enhances penalties for 
FARA 
violations 
to 
deter 
future 
abuses. It requires foreign agents to 
immediately 
disclose 
their 
clients. 
That way, policymakers know the true 
sources and can make the most in-
formed decisions. 
Finally, it requires a review of the 
Lobbying Disclosure Act exemption to 
determine whether it has been abused 
to conceal foreign influence efforts. 
Legitimate interests engaging in le-
gitimate conduct shouldn’t bear an un-
necessary burden. That is why our bill 
strikes a real and right balance. But we 
must also ensure that FARA’s exemp-
tions haven’t created loopholes for for-
eign governments to hide their true in-
tentions. 
I am pleased to have support from 
the chairman and ranking member of 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
and 
the 
chairman and vice chairman of the In-
telligence Committee. We have bipar-
tisan support on the Foreign Relations 
Committee, including from Senators 
SHAHEEN, RUBIO, MURPHY, and YOUNG, 
who have all worked to shine light on 
foreign influence, and we now have the 
signoff of the chairman of that com-
mittee, along with support from this 
administration. 
Groups 
like 
the 
Project on Government Oversight and 
another group that goes by the name of 
Issue One endorse the measure, saying

it ‘‘directly addresses structural weak-
nesses of FARA.’’ 
This is a truly bipartisan bill with 
common ground where it is usually 
tough to find it. The Senate should 
send a clear signal today that it is seri-
ous about shining a light on foreign in-
fluence by passing this bill. 
Before I make a UC request, I would 
like to ask one of the leaders in this 
area, Senator CORNYN, to make com-
ments. Then I will make the UC re-
quest. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me 
start by thanking Chairman GRASSLEY 
for his leadership on this. This has 
been a bipartisan endeavor, and we 
look forward to working with Senator 
MENENDEZ, the Senator from New Jer-
sey, who says that he supports the spir-
it of what we are trying to do. I will let 
him speak for himself in describing it, 
but let me just tell you what brings me 
to this issue. 
It is an experience we had in 2016 
when we tried to pass the Justice 
Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. 
This provided a carve-out in the doc-
trine 
of 
sovereign 
immunity 
that 
would allow Americans to sue foreign 
governments for financing terrorist at-
tacks on American soil. If that sounds 
familiar, it is exactly what they be-
lieve happened on 9/11—that a foreign 
government financed a terrorist at-
tack, taking the lives of their loved 
ones on 9/11. 
When we tried to pass the Justice 
Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, I 
got called by a former colleague here 
in the Senate who happened to be rep-
resenting the Kingdom of Saudi Ara-
bia. They were doing everything they 
could to prevent the passage of the bill. 
I know they were working the phones, 
trying to get anybody else they could 
get to object to the ultimate unani-
mous passage of the bill and the over-
riding of President Obama’s veto. 
Next, we were met with not only lob-
bying but veterans who were enticed to 
come to Washington, DC, and stay at a 
local, pricey hotel to try to lobby Con-
gress to make the argument that some-
how this was hurtful to our veterans 
who had served in the military. It 
didn’t make any sense to me then, and 
it doesn’t make any sense to me now. 
What I am suggesting is that our ri-
vals around the world will use a num-
ber of creative ways to try to influence 
us by lobbying. That is why the For-
eign Agents Registration Act that we 
are talking about here is so important. 
We have even seen a recent report of 
a Chinese intelligence officer trying to 
influence a Member of the U.S. Con-
gress. Fortunately, according to public 
reports, he got a defensive briefing, as 
you should under those circumstances, 
and was able to break off that relation-
ship, according to published reports. 
We know that the Communist Party 
of China is investing in things like the 
Confucius Institutes around our insti-
tutions of higher learning to try to in-
fluence the education of our next gen-
eration of leaders. 
In other words, the Communist Party 
of China and other countries will stop 
at nothing to try to influence the poli-
cies that come out of this body and out 
of Congress and out of Washington, DC, 
and bend them in their favor. 
So I am an enthusiastic supporter of 
what the Senator from Iowa is trying 
to do. I look forward to working for 
maybe even something better than 
what we are proposing right now, and I 
understand the Senator from New Jer-
sey is committed to doing that. 
This is a serious problem, and I will 
bet you there are a number of ways 
that foreign governments—not just 
China but other countries around the 
world—try to influence policies here in 
America, and we don’t even know they 
are doing it. Reforming the Foreign 
Agents Registration Act and the Lob-
bying Disclosure Act is so important to 
make sure that people have to file for 
full transparency when representing a 
foreign government. 
I appreciate the leadership of my 
friend, the Senator from Iowa, and I 
look forward to working with our col-
leagues across the aisle to try to get 
this done. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
have two sentences before I ask unani-
mous consent. 
I think by passing the bill, this will 
give the Senate an opportunity to send 
a clear signal that it is serious about 
shining a light on foreign influence. 
Opposing it, in fact, would only help 
our foreign adversaries continue to 
hide what they are really doing. 
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Committee on 
Foreign Relations be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 1762 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. I further ask that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, in 
reserving the right to object, let me 
thank Senator GRASSLEY for his work 
on this issue, and I agree with him that 
our current foreign regime is in need of 
updating. I look forward to working 
with him and Senator CORNYN and with 
Senators WHITEHOUSE
and SHAHEEN, 
who both came to speak to me about 
this, as well as with Chairman RISCH 
and the cosponsors of this legislation, 
on engaging in a comprehensive effort 
to do just that. 
FARA, the Foreign Agents Registra-
tion Act, is perhaps the most critical 
tool we have for shining a light on for-
eign influence efforts in the United 
States. Its aim is to ensure that the 
public knows the source of foreign-di-
rected efforts that are intended to in-
fluence American public opinion, pol-
icy, and laws. 
I agree with the Senator that the 
past few years have demonstrated that 
changes are sorely needed to FARA, 
but they also demonstrate that the 
statute may need more than a few 
tweaks. 
And before we have determined ex-
actly what the most needed reforms 
are, it seems shortsighted to provide 
additional enforcement tools before we 
have figured out what that regime 
should look like. 
Indeed, adopting ad hoc changes 
rather than looking at more com-
prehensive reform could actually cre-
ate more problems down the road. 
Many have noted that FARA’s defini-
tions and requirements are broad and 
sow confusion over exactly when and 
under what circumstances an indi-
vidual must register and report covered 
activities. There is no denying the na-
ture of lobbying, influence efforts, and 
communication methods have dramati-
cally changed since FARA was enacted 
in 1938 or even revised in 1966. 
We live in a dramatically more inter-
connected and complex world today. 
Foreign 
influence 
efforts 
and 
disinformation have made their way 
into the top echelons of U.S. Govern-
ment and this very body. It seems only 
prudent that we step back and examine 
whether there are blind spots in the 
current FARA regime. 
There are a number of bills pending 
in both the House and the Senate that 
propose reforms to FARA. Some pro-
pose a new unit altogether for review-
ing and enforcing FARA violations. 
Others propose additional disclosure 
and registration requirements, signifi-
cant changes to the current FARA ex-
emptions, or more electronic reporting. 
Yet none of those have been given thor-
ough or, indeed, any consideration by 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, the committee of jurisdiction. 
There are also a number of concerns 
about the current FARA regime, as 
well as how it has been applied, that 
deserve consideration. Some nonprofit 
organizations, for example, have raised 
serious concerns about how FARA 
could be applied to them and are seek-
ing additional changes to this bill to 
ensure it is not weaponized. 
And as other countries, such as Rus-
sia and Hungary, adopt their own 
versions of FARA laws and look to use 
them to crack down on civil society 
groups and nonprofits, we should be es-
pecially concerned about the signal 
that any potential weaponizing of 
FARA sends. 
The past few years have shown how 
critical it is that we not adopt a patch-
work approach but that we get it right. 
The disturbing rise of foreign influ-
ence campaigns that use a variety of 
measures to mask who is the ultimate 
source or beneficiary should serve as 
an alarm bell for all of us. So before 
this body passes any tweaks or new 
tools and adds to the current patch-
work of FARA regulations and exemp-
tions, I think we should take a step 
back and take a comprehensive look, 
and we have not done that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7520 
December 16, 2020 
So, 
respectfully, 
these 
changes 
should not pass this body without care-
ful consideration by the committee of 
jurisdiction. A committee markup is 
the appropriate vehicle for considering 
such changes to assess the ramifica-
tions of the changes in this bill and to 
see if other changes are warranted. 
I stand ready and willing to work 
with Chairman RISCH, Senator GRASS-
LEY, and other colleagues to make any 
needed changes to FARA, but because 
of all of these concerns that I have, I 
would object today to passing this bill 
out of the Senate without first giving 
the committee the opportunity to con-
sider it and other potential reforms. 
I urge my colleagues to give us the 
opportunity to work through this to-
gether and ensure the Foreign Assets 
Registration Act is fit for the 21st cen-
tury. And because of that, I do object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Of course I am dis-
appointed, but I know that Senator 
MENENDEZ is a serious legislator, and if 
what we have to do to do something in 
this area is work into the next Con-
gress on this issue, I look forward to 
continuing to work for it. 
The reason I am kind of disappointed 
is the fact that we had two Democratic 
bills and two Republican bills. I intro-
duced my first bill in 2017, and it took 
a lot of work to put together the bill 
that I asked unanimous consent on, to 
work out the differences with several 
different approaches, and I thought 
that we had taken everything into con-
sideration, particularly bringing to-
gether people from the Intelligence 
Committee and the Judiciary Com-
mittee that had interest in this legisla-
tion as well. 
Maybe another reason I am dis-
appointed out of that hard work that 
so many people put into this is the fact 
that on the part of particularly our 
Democratic colleagues, we have heard 
so much over the years, lecturing 
about foreign influence, and that is 
why I thought it would be easy to move 
forward today, and I am sorry it is not, 
but I look forward to January and 
starting over again and working with 
Senator MENENDEZ to get this job done. 
Hopefully, it will not take 3 years more 
to get something done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I look 
forward to working with the Senator 
from New Jersey and the Senator from 
Iowa. As I said, this is a very serious 
problem for the U.S. Government, and, 
thus, for the American people. 
One of our greatest assets is also one 
of our greatest vulnerabilities. We are 
an open society. Our adversaries are 
not, and, thus, they use things like the 
internet 
for 
information 
warfare, 
whereas we see it as a valuable tool to 
do business, to stay in touch with our 
families, and to communicate with one 
another. Our adversaries are deter-
mined, and they are relentless, so I 
hope that just this little colloquy 
today will help alert more of our col-
leagues about the importance of our 
working together to address this. I 
look forward to being part of that proc-
ess. 
Nothing happens very quickly around 
this place. Sometimes you have to 
work on things for years to get them 
done. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, speaking of working 
hard to solve problems, my hope is that 
we are closing in on our ability to pass 
the next COVID–19 relief bill. As the 
Presiding Officer knows, we have been 
at this for a while. 
It has been since March that we 
passed the CARES Act, and we have 
tried a number of times to try to pass 
additional relief for our small busi-
nesses and individuals, provide more 
resources to our frontline healthcare 
workers—make sure that they have the 
PPE, the testing and that the vaccine 
that is now here can be deployed in a 
way that as many Americans who can 
get the vaccine as possible will do so. 
Again, we know that the intervening 
election has been a problem because 
some people saw benefits to not solving 
the problem, and that would somehow 
gain them advantage at the ballot box. 
And still, today, there are still dis-
agreements over a handful of con-
troversial provisions, but as we enter 
the final days of the 116th Congress, it 
is now time to break that stalemate. 
There is no doubt in my mind that 
every Member of this body has a little 
different vision about what the next re-
lief package should look like, but as 
the old saying goes, we shouldn’t let 
the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
The search for compromise—which is 
really part of our job description here— 
on some of the most controversial 
measures has left us emptyhanded, and 
it is time to set aside those pieces that 
we can’t agree on and make progress 
on the ones we can. 
First and foremost is funding for vac-
cine distribution that I alluded to a 
moment ago. Last week, the FDA ap-
proved the first COVID–19 vaccine, and 
the process of vaccinating our frontline 
healthcare workers is already under-
way. And there is a good chance that 
by this time next week, millions of 
doses of a second approved vaccine will 
be en route to hospitals across the 
country. 
There is no question that the race to 
develop an effective COVID vaccine has 
been a success. It has really been noth-
ing short of a miracle. Now it is crit-
ical we take additional actions to en-
sure the race to distribute the vaccine 
is successful as well. 
We have been waiting and planning 
for a vaccine all year, but the funding 
Congress provided in the CARES Act to 
help execute the nationwide distribu-
tion project has run dry. While the cost 
of the vaccine itself is already covered, 
there are a host of other expenses that 
come with vaccinating tens of mil-
lions—maybe hundreds of millions—of 
people. 
States are dipping into their other 
sources of funding to ensure they have 
the capabilities to carry out this wide-
spread effort, but it takes specialized 
equipment from ultralow temperature 
freezers to store the vaccine, to masks 
and gloves and other PPE to protect 
those administering it, and it is easy to 
see that the costs add up quickly. 
So the time for politicking and cam-
paigning is over. Now is the time for us 
to solve this problem and ensure that 
this vaccine distribution program goes 
off without a hitch. This is the silver 
bullet we have been praying for and 
hoping for, and it would be shameful if 
our partisan dysfunction in Congress 
stood in the way of the success of Oper-
ation Warp Speed. 
Second, we must support the men 
and women whose livelihoods have 
been upended by the pandemic. We all 
know that. We have done a lot, but we 
need to do more. 
We didn’t know in March how long 
this 
virus 
would 
last, 
how 
many 
lockdowns would ensue. 
In April, as businesses closed doors to 
stop the spread of the virus, our na-
tionwide 
unemployment 
rate 
sky-
rocketed to 14.7 percent. Tens of mil-
lions of Americans simply had no way 
to earn a paycheck, cover their bills, or 
even put food on their table. Many re-
lied on the bolstered unemployment in-
surance benefits provided through the 
CARES Act, which helped cover bills 
and expenses until they were able to 
resume their jobs. 
Fortunately, our economic engine did 
not remain stalled for long. That is not 
only due to what we have done here but 
what the Federal Reserve has done. 
And over the past several months, the 
unemployment 
rate 
has 
gradually 
ticked down and reached 6.7 percent in 
November. 
I have no doubt that we will continue 
to rebuild our economy and put more 
people back to work who are eager to 
get back to work. But the reality is, it 
is going to take a while. 
There are still workers with no way 
to earn a paycheck, and unless we take 
action, they are sure to face an even 
more dire economic strain in the days 
ahead. The day after Christmas—the 
day after Christmas—two key pro-
grams from the CARES Act expire, 
which will leave millions of Americans 
without the jobless benefits that they 
and their families need to survive. It 
would be a shame, it would be embar-
rassing and, frankly, just flat negligent 
on our part if we did not intervene to 
make sure that we establish a con-
tinuum of support for these folks who, 
through no fault of their own, find 
themselves without work. 
These are the same people who, 
again, through no fault of their own, 
had the rug pulled out from under 
them earlier this year, and we can’t 
leave them hanging. We have to help. 
Third, we need to continue sup-
porting our small businesses. Congress

December 16, 2020 
invested $670 billion in the Paycheck 
Protection Program. Every time I say 
a number like that—or $3 trillion—I 
still have to pinch myself that we are 
spending the money. We need to spend 
this money in order to meet this pan-
demic, but the Paycheck Protection 
Program, in particular, has been a life-
line for America’s small business own-
ers, especially in my State. 
Texas received more than $41 billion 
through more than 417,000 individual 
PPP loans. This has given our busi-
nesses the resources they need to stay 
afloat and stay connected to their em-
ployees until things can return to 
whatever the next normal is. 
But we know the process is hap-
pening much faster for some businesses 
than others. It is interesting: A number 
of businesses, I would say, are flour-
ishing during the pandemic—it is real-
ly, really interesting—while others are 
just flat on their backs or nonexistent. 
Many small businesses that have al-
ready received PPP loans are still op-
erating at a significant loss. They are 
unable to bring in enough revenue to 
keep their businesses and employees 
above water, and they need more as-
sistance. Again, that is because of a 
lack of demand or because of restric-
tions governments have placed on peo-
ple in the interest of public health— 
some of them seemingly pretty arbi-
trary. I won’t go down that path here. 
But these folks need help. 
Currently, those businesses aren’t el-
igible for a second draw of the PPP, 
and unless we want Main Streets 
across the country to turn into ghost 
towns, that needs to change. We need 
to reopen the PPP with additional 
funding for the hardest hit businesses 
to receive a second loan. This is the 
most effective way of keeping Ameri-
cans connected with their employers 
and more small businesses on track for 
a strong postpandemic recovery. 
There are a number of other busi-
nesses—small businesses—that didn’t 
qualify for the PPP which need our as-
sistance, too. Things like small, inde-
pendent music venues are the best ex-
ample of a critical Main Street indus-
try that is dying under the current 
COVID restrictions. 
That is why I worked with our friend 
from Minnesota, Senator KLOBUCHAR, 
to introduce the Save Our Stages Act, 
which will keep independent venues 
across America from closing their 
doors for good. This wouldn’t just 
apply to live music venues in Austin, 
TX. This would apply to symphonies 
and, potentially, Broadway. This would 
apply across the board. 
I am proud to say that 56 of our col-
leagues have cosponsored the Save Our 
Stages Act, making it one of the most 
widely supported stimulus proposals 
before the Senate. 
Again, I know the Presiding Officer 
has had his shoulder to the grindstone 
on this topic for a long time now. We 
still have a lot of work to do, but we 
don’t have much time. 
Beyond these three goals, there is a 
lot more I would like to see in the re-
lief bill, and I guarantee all 535 Mem-
bers of Congress would like to see more 
for other things in the relief bill. But 
the fact of the matter is, we have been 
unable to reach an agreement on a bill 
that includes the most controversial 
priorities, and it is time to take action 
where we can act and where we do have 
consensus and come back next year and 
try to do more and try to do better. 
Each of these areas I just men-
tioned—support for vaccines, our work-
ers, and small businesses—have that 
sort of strong bipartisan support. So I 
think all 100 of us—whether Repub-
licans, Independents, or Democrats— 
should be able to line up behind a bill 
that supports these goals. Over the last 
several days, we have seen more bipar-
tisan communication and cooperation 
than we saw in months—in the months 
leading up to this point, certainly since 
March. And I hope we are able to reach 
an agreement and pass another relief 
bill before gaveling out. As a matter of 
fact, I heard the majority leader say we 
are not leaving until we do, and I agree 
with that. 
The American people have repeatedly 
called on Congress to provide support 
for those hit hardest by this pandemic, 
and we simply cannot and will not let 
them down. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BLUNT). The Senator from Arkansas. 
DEBORAH SAMPSON ACT 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize a significant legisla-
tive victory the Senate delivered for 
women veterans that will eliminate 
barriers to care and services that many 
women face when accessing the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs. 
The VA estimates that women make 
up approximately 10 percent of our Na-
tion’s veteran population. That number 
is expected to increase to more than 16 
percent within the next 25 years. As a 
result, the number of women veterans 
receiving healthcare from the VA has 
more than tripled since 2000. 
The changing face of our military re-
quires us to reexamine how we can best 
serve these veterans. The VA has been 
slow to modernize its delivery of 
healthcare and benefits to support 
their needs. Women veterans are more 
likely to face homelessness, unemploy-
ment, and go without needed medical 
healthcare. They are reluctant to turn 
to the VA for help. More than 50 per-
cent of women veterans believe they 
are not entitled to or eligible for VA 
care. We must do more to fulfill our 
promise. 
We need to create a culture at the 
VA that welcomes women veterans and 
makes them feel like they belong. It is 
long overdue, and we need to update 
the belief that when a women seeks 
care at the VA, it is because her hus-
band is the veteran. So often, it is not 
uncommon for a veteran employee to 
pass a woman in line and ask, you 
know, is her husband around. 
Arkansans have shared with me sug-
gestions for improvement that include: 
expanding care options women can ac-
cess at the VA to reduce the need for 
referrals to community care, increas-
ing trained medical professionals who 
specialize in women’s health issues, 
and enhancing privacy in exam rooms. 
These are reasonable steps that the VA 
can implement to ensure equitable ac-
cess to services. 
The good news is, we are one step 
closer to making these upgrades a re-
ality, thanks to Senate passage of the 
Deborah Sampson Act. The Veterans’ 
Affairs ranking committee member, 
JON TESTER, and I introduced this leg-
islation, fittingly, named after a Revo-
lutionary War veteran who disguised 
herself as a man to help defeat the 
British. In her spirit, we must do more 
to address the gender disparities at the 
VA. 
We used the recommendations we 
heard from veterans in Arkansas, Mon-
tana, and all across the country to de-
velop our legislation to eliminate the 
barriers to care. The Deborah Sampson 
Act creates a dedicated Office of Wom-
en’s Health at the VA, expands the re-
integration and readjustment group, 
counseling retreats for women veterans 
and their families, and improves call 
center services. 
It increases the number of gender- 
specific providers and coordinators in 
VA facilities, trains clinicians, and ret-
rofits VA facilities to bolster privacy 
and improve the environment. It pro-
vides access to legal services for 
women veterans and expands childcare 
for veterans receiving healthcare at 
the VA. 
These are just a few of the improve-
ments this bill requires the VA to im-
plement so we can better serve the 
needs of women veterans. 
I appreciate the leadership of Senator 
TESTER and the support of veterans 
service organizations and encourage 
Members of Congress to support this 
legislation. I applaud the Senate for 
advancing the legislation and urge my 
colleagues in the House of Representa-
tives to quickly approve this bill so we 
can ensure women who serve in uni-
form receive the care and services that 
they so earned. 
Also, as always, I want to thank the 
staffs of myself and Senator TESTER 
who worked so hard in this regard, and, 
simply, this would not have become 
law without their tremendous efforts. 
So, with that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The Senator from Wyoming. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to ask our 
Democratic colleagues to join us Re-
publicans in providing immediate re-
lief—relief 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
coronavirus and economic relief for the 
people of this country. 
Americans don’t ask much of their 
government, but they are asking us for 
something right now. No. 1, they are 
asking to help control the spread of the 
coronavirus, and, No. 2, they are asking 
to help with an economic recovery.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7522 
December 16, 2020 
America and Americans shouldn’t 
have to choose between staying open 
and staying healthy. We need both, and 
Congress needs to provide a path be-
yond the pandemic. 
A path forward, as the Presiding Offi-
cer knows, is something Republicans 
have been proposing now for a long 
time. We have done it, first, with the 
CARES Act, and we need to do it right 
now with additional coronavirus and 
economic relief legislation. 
Our bill is practical. It supports our 
neighborhoods—men and women work-
ing on Main Street in our small towns 
and communities all across the coun-
try. We also need to provide unemploy-
ment help for those who, for no reason 
of their own, happen to find themselves 
out of work as a result of the pan-
demic. We need to get the vaccine to as 
many Americans as we can as quickly 
and safely as we can, especially during 
this holiday season, when we are really 
looking at a medical miracle. 
Now, what we have seen from the 
other side is gridlock—no path forward 
on the economy, no path forward on 
coronavirus. We have seen them play 
politics with the pandemic. House and 
Senate Republicans have tried now 40 
times—40 different times—to get some-
thing accepted that can be sent to pro-
vide that relief for the American pub-
lic. The Democrats, each and every 
time, blocked it. The gridlock must 
end today. 
Mr. President, I would like to spend 
just a moment on this historic vaccine 
discovery. It is, to me as a doctor, com-
parable to insulin, comparable to the 
vaccine for polio, and comparable to 
penicillin as an antibiotic. It is going 
to be that dramatic in terms of the 
change in the world. 
As we gather on the floor today, 
planes, trucks, UPS, and Federal Ex-
press are all taking vaccines across the 
country to many, many locations— 
over 636 this first week. So it is not 
just a scientific triumph. It is also a 
logistical triumph. 
Every newspaper in the country yes-
terday, I believe, had a picture of some-
body receiving the vaccine, receiving 
the shot in that local community. It is 
a remarkable time for our Nation. As 
Christmas packages are being deliv-
ered, so is this great hope for people re-
ceiving the vaccine. 
All told, this week, there were 3 mil-
lion doses distributed to people around 
the country, in 636 sites. In my State 
alone, Wyoming, there are 5 different 
locations where the vaccine has arrived 
and over 5,000 people being vaccinated 
this week. By the end of the year, there 
will be 15,000. I am sure in the Pre-
siding Officer’s State of Indiana, there 
are more locations than that, more 
people being vaccinated. The frontline 
workers are getting it first, and that is 
the way we need to do it. 
As part of the CARES Act—the Pre-
siding Officer and I voted for it—$10 
billion went to help develop the vac-
cine and money spent to distribute the 
vaccine. But we need to do more. About 
$6 billion is additionally needed to help 
in a full distribution of the vaccine. 
Well, I am ready to vote for that. I 
want to make sure we have that money 
so the vaccine, which has been amazing 
in terms of the speed of development, 
can also be deployed similarly to what 
was done. 
This vaccine was done in an unprece-
dented scale—the number of people 
who are going to be vaccinated, the 
success, the timeline. A safe, effective, 
and powerful vaccine is truly aston-
ishing. Never has a vaccine been devel-
oped or distributed faster. 
It truly is this Senate, under the 
CARES Act, and this administration, 
under Operation Warp Speed, which 
stood this operation up and made it 
successful. So we are seeing the real ef-
fects as people are getting the shot. 
When you think about it in the big 
picture—and you know this, Mr. Presi-
dent, from your background in business 
and contributing in your community— 
this is what we talk about when we 
talk about American ingenuity. It is 
why people around the world look to 
America for answers, because when 
things that are critical occur, it is 
America that finds the solutions, as we 
have done right now with this vaccine. 
We have come together, public as 
well 
as 
private, 
over 
the 
last 
8 
months—the FDA—to approve a vac-
cine. It is interesting: Who should get 
it first—the doctors, the nurses? I 
know firefighters are getting it here in 
the District of Columbia. Firefighters 
have been getting it at home in Wyo-
ming, and people like the healthcare 
providers, and then, of course, those 
who are most vulnerable, people who 
are in our nursing homes right now and 
in assisted living facilities, people who 
are most vulnerable. That is who ought 
to get it first. 
I know when the time comes for me, 
I am going to get it. My wife is going 
to get it. We will be saying yes because 
I believe it is safe, I believe it is effec-
tive, and I believe it is the solution 
that gets us through this. It gets us 
through the disease, and it gets the 
economy back on track. 
I talked to one of the doctors who 
runs the intensive care unit at Wyo-
ming Medical Center. The healthcare 
personnel are exhausted. They have 
been working double shifts. If one gets 
sick, others have to pick up the work-
load, as more and more people show up 
in the hospitals and the emergency 
rooms with coronavirus. This is very 
welcome relief. 
I talked to a physician who works in 
the emergency room. She is going to be 
vaccinated on Friday. So this is what 
we need. 
It is so interesting. The pundits talk 
about 
the 
dark 
winters 
of 
the 
coronavirus 
surge, 
but 
for 
the 
healthcare providers in our home com-
munities, they have to keep the doors 
open every day and keep the lights on 
and take care of these patients, one 
after another after another. 
Once the first one came—and the 
wave hit different parts of the country 
at different times—once the first pa-
tient came, they continued to come, 
and they are still coming today. That 
is why this vaccine is such a welcome 
relief and why, for the healthcare pro-
viders who have done such remarkable 
work, we can say this is their finest 
hour. They have kept us going, kept 
patients, offered of themselves, and 
now the vaccines have arrived. 
We need to do more in this body. We 
have healthcare workers leading by ex-
ample. We have folks in assisted living. 
Close to half of all the people who lost 
their lives because of coronavirus were 
residents of assisted living. But of 
those millions of healthcare workers, 
we need to make sure that the vaccines 
continue to flow to them and to all of 
society and to all people in this coun-
try. 
It is by doing that, that we will put 
this disease behind us. We will be back 
to our strong, robust, and growing 
economy. Our kids will be back full 
time in school. The universities will be 
returning to the robust future that we 
know is ahead of them. 
It is because of the work of this body, 
months ago, with the CARES Act. 
But our work is not done. As we ap-
proach the Christmas holidays, there is 
more work to be done. I turn to my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
and say: Please, join us this holiday 
season to make sure that the American 
people, who don’t ask for much, are 
able to continue to keep their lives on 
track, get back on track, and move for-
ward into the year 2021 with a vaccine 
available to everyone and for a much 
better new year. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me 
say a few words on the coronavirus re-
lief package that is now being nego-
tiated. In my view, this bill of roughly 
$900 billion has a number of enor-
mously important provisions in it 
which will do a great deal of service 
and help for the American people. 
We are talking about funding for vac-
cine 
distribution, 
which 
is 
a 
no- 
brainer. We have got to get that vac-
cine out to every State in this country 
if we are going to finally put an end to 
this horrific pandemic. We are talking 
about, in this bill, in this proposal, in-
creased 
funding 
for 
education, 
healthcare, childcare, nutrition, hous-
ing, transportation, and many other 
very important areas. 
I agree with all of that, but the prob-
lem is that, while this proposal ad-
dresses some of the major crises facing 
our country and the families of our 
country, there is simply not enough 
money in the proposal to deal with the 
unprecedented crises that we now face. 
It is no secret to anybody that right 
now, at this moment in America, we 
face the worst set of crises that this 
country has seen for perhaps a hundred 
years. 
The 
pandemic 
is 
surging 
throughout America. More and more

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7523 
December 16, 2020 
people are being diagnosed with the 
virus. More and more people are ending 
up in hospital. More and more people 
are dying. 
But it is not just a public health cri-
sis that we are addressing; we are deal-
ing with a terrible, terrible economic 
meltdown, where many, many millions 
of people have lost their jobs; they 
have lost their healthcare. People are 
working, in many cases, for fewer 
hours. Rather than 40 hours a week, 
they are working 30 hours a week—less 
income coming in. 
So this bill has a lot in it that is 
good, but given the enormity of the cri-
ses that we face, it simply does not go 
anywhere far enough. 
As the Presiding Officer may well re-
member, in May, in response to the cri-
sis, the Democratic House passed a He-
roes bill calling for $3.4 trillion in new 
money to address the kind of crises 
that we are facing. And while that bill 
did not have everything that I wanted 
in it, it was a serious, serious step for-
ward in addressing the multitude of 
crises facing our country. It was a $3.4 
trillion bill, passed in the House in 
May. 
In July, the House came back and 
said: Well, we are not going to spend 
$3.4 trillion; we are going to reduce it 
to $2.2 trillion, and they passed what 
was called a Heroes 2 bill, which called 
for $2.2 trillion in new money. Again, it 
did not go as far as I would want but 
was a very serious effort. 
Among other things in that bill as 
well as the first Heroes bill, there was 
a provision to extend unemployment 
benefits for another 4 months and pro-
vide a $600 supplementary check. And 
there were provisions in it to provide a 
$1,200 direct payment to adults and $500 
to their children. That was the Heroes 
2 bill for $2.2 trillion. 
Just a few months ago, the Trump 
administration, represented by Sec-
retary of the Treasury Mnuchin, pro-
posed a $1.8 trillion bill—$1.8 trillion. 
Today, the bill that is being nego-
tiated calls for all of $348 billion in new 
money. This is a $900 billion bill, but 
most of the funding is carried over 
from the CARES Act—$348 billion in 
new money. In other words, this is 
roughly 10 percent of what Democrats 
in the House passed in the first Heroes 
bill. 
Now, I was a mayor for 8 years. I 
know a little bit about negotiating. I, 
frankly, don’t know how you negotiate 
from $3.4 trillion down to $348 billion. 
You got 10 percent of what you origi-
nally started with. 
This is not just numbers. What this is 
about is whether, in this moment of 
unprecedented crisis, when families are 
struggling to feed their children, when 
a half a million people are sleeping out 
on the street, when in the midst of this 
awful pandemic over 90 million Ameri-
cans are uninsured or underinsured and 
can’t go to the doctor in the midst of a 
pandemic, when they are sick, at a 
time when many, many millions of 
families are worried about getting 
evicted from their apartments or their 
homes because they no longer have the 
income to pay their rent or pay their 
mortgage—that is the crisis that we 
are in right now. And, unfortunately, 
this proposal does not address that cri-
sis to the degree that it should. 
Now, that is the bad news. My hope— 
very sincere hope—is that when the 
Biden administration comes into office 
in late January, their very first pri-
ority will be to address the deficiencies 
and the inadequacies in this bill. 
The American people today, the 
working class of this country today, 
are struggling in a way that we have 
not seen since the Great Depression of 
the 1930s. People are desperate. I will 
never forget, in my State, in my com-
munity, in my neighborhood, a few 
months 
ago—Burlington, 
VT—they 
shut down—the State shut down a 
highway, and hundreds and hundreds of 
automobiles lined up, one behind each 
other, in order to get emergency food 
distributed 
by 
Vermont 
National 
Guard—in my community. 
That is going on all over this coun-
try, where States are in worse shape 
than the State of Vermont. People who 
have never, ever gone to an emergency 
food shelter are now lining up for emer-
gency food packages in the United 
States of America, in the richest coun-
try in the history of the world, at a 
time, by the way, when a number of 
billionaires are doing phenomenally 
well. 
So this bill, in my view, does not go 
anywhere near far enough in terms of 
addressing our crises, and I hope that 
as soon as the Biden administration 
comes into office, they will address 
those deficiencies. 
Now, the good news—there is some 
good news, and I am happy, as we enter 
the holiday season, to say something 
that I think the American people are 
wanting to hear. And that is, when you 
ask the American people—and the poll-
sters do that. They say to the Amer-
ican people that we are in the midst of 
this terrible crisis; what do you think 
should happen? 
Overwhelmingly, some 80 percent of 
the American people—overwhelmingly, 
Republicans, Democrats, Independents, 
they say that, in the midst of this 
emergency, we need the U.S. Govern-
ment to respond to our pain because we 
don’t want to get evicted; we don’t 
want our kids to go hungry; we don’t 
want to be saddled with incredible 
debt. The government has got to do 
something. 
Eighty percent of the American peo-
ple—Democrats, 
Republicans, 
Inde-
pendents—understand that. 
Then, when you ask them, ‘‘What is 
the most important thing that can be 
done?’’—there is a long list of things— 
what they say is the most important 
thing that can be done is, in this mo-
ment, help my family out. Get me 
some money so I can pay my bills, so I 
don’t get evicted, so I can feed my kids, 
so I can go to the doctor when I get 
sick. Get me a direct payment. 
As you know, the CARES Act pro-
vided $1,200 for every working-class 
adult in this country; that is, for an in-
dividual earning less than $75,000 a 
year; for a couple, $150,000; plus $500 for 
their kids. That means, for a family of 
four—husband, wife, and two kids— 
that is $3,400. 
Now, you don’t get rich with that, 
but when you get a check for $3,400 for 
a family of four, it means that maybe 
you can pay your bills; maybe you can 
breathe a little bit easier; maybe, come 
Christmastime, you might actually be 
able to buy your kids a few gifts; 
maybe the fear of eviction is lessened 
just a little bit. 
That is what we did in the CARES 
Act, and that is what I wanted in this 
bill. Now, a week ago, 10 days ago no-
body here was talking about the need 
for direct payments, help for working 
families, despite the fact that that is 
the issue, the program that the Amer-
ican people most wanted. There are a 
lot of other important things that we 
are dealing with. That is what the 
American people wanted: Help us out. 
Let us make a decision. Get us some 
money in this time of need. 
I am happy to say, working with peo-
ple like Senator HAWLEY of Missouri; 
working with the Progressive Caucus 
in the House of Representatives; work-
ing with Senators GILLIBRAND, WAR-
REN, MERKLEY, MARKEY, and WYDEN; 
working with PRAMILA JAYAPAL and 
many others in the House, ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, RASHIDA TLAIB, ILHAN 
OMAR, RO KHANNA, and many others 
who have stood up in the House and 
said ‘‘We have to have direct pay-
ments,’’ I am happy to say that, as of 
now—and we are going to fight for 
more because this process is not over— 
the proposal, as I understand it, pro-
vides for a direct payment of $600 for 
every working-class adult and $600 for 
their kids. That means for a family of 
four, that would be $2,400. That is half 
of what I wanted, but it is a step for-
ward. I am going do my best to make 
sure that we come as close to that 
$1,200 as we possibly can. 
Millions of our people today are liv-
ing in desperation. Half of our workers 
are living paycheck to paycheck, while 
one out of four American workers 
today is either unemployed or making 
a starvation wage of less than $20,000 a 
year. During the holiday season, over 
one-third of Americans expect to lose 
income—one-third—and are having a 
difficult time paying for basic house-
hold expenses. In America today, hun-
ger is at its highest level in decades. 
More than half a million Americans are 
homeless, and over 30 million of our 
people are on the brink of eviction. By 
January 1, 12 million Americans will 
owe an average of $5,800 in back rent. 
As bad as this crisis is for the whole 
population, from coast to coast, it is 
worse for the African-American and 
Latino and Native American commu-
nities. During this pandemic, nearly 60 
percent of Latino families and 55 per-
cent of African-American families and

December 16, 2020 
many, many, many Native American 
families have either experienced a job 
loss or a pay cut. 
All across this country, working fam-
ilies are standing up and saying: You 
know what, we have served in the mili-
tary. We are doing our best to raise our 
kids in this unprecedented moment in 
history. We need help. 
I want to thank not only my friends 
in the Congressional Progressive Cau-
cus in the House of Representatives— 
JAYAPAL, TLAIB, OMAR, OCASIO-CORTEZ, 
RO KHANNA, and many, many others—I 
also want to thank the millions of 
Americans who have stood up and de-
manded that the government respond 
to the needs of working families. 
I want to thank the over 60 groups 
representing millions of working fami-
lies, 
progressives, 
the 
elderly 
and 
young people, including Public Citizen, 
the Center for Popular Democracy, the 
Sunrise Movement, Social Security 
Works, Presente, and People’s Action, 
for pushing a progressive agenda for-
ward and for demanding that this gov-
ernment respond to the needs of our 
people. 
So here we are, as this proposal con-
tinues to be negotiated. As I said ear-
lier, it is my hope that not only do we 
make sure that unemployment benefits 
are extended for another 16 weeks at 
$300 per week, it is my hope that we 
can see some light here and get to the 
$1,200 direct payment that adults in 
this country desperately need. I am 
going to do my best in the coming days 
to make sure that happens. I hope the 
American people will join with me and 
get on the phones and call up their 
Members of the House and Members of 
the Senate and say that in this unprec-
edented moment in American history, 
government has to respond to the 
needs of working families. 
With that, I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7525 
December 16, 2020 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from New 
Jersey. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4711 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today and will soon 
ask unanimous consent for the passage 
of the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security 
and Privacy Act of 2020. This legisla-
tion is about standing up for the inde-
pendence of our Federal judiciary and 
the safety of all of those who serve it. 
Many of you already know the ter-
rible tragedy that recently struck Fed-
eral District Judge Esther Salas and 
her family in New Jersey. This sum-
mer, an unhinged and violent indi-
vidual showed up at Judge Salas’s 
home, impersonating a package deliv-
ery driver. When her 20-year-old son 
Daniel Anderl answered the door, the 
assailant opened fire, taking the life of 
her only child and seriously wounding 
her husband Mark Anderl. 
Unfortunately, this tragedy is not 
the first attack on a Federal judge. 
There was the 1979 murder of Judge 
John Wood in San Antonio, TX; the 
1988 murder of Judge Richard Daronco 
in Pelham, NY; the 1989 murder of 
Judge 
Robert 
Vance 
in 
Mountain 
Brook, AL; the 2005 murder of the hus-
band and mother of Judge Joan Lefkow 
in Illinois. 
And there have been other attacks as 
well. In June, 2013, Chief Judge Tim-
othy Corrigan was targeted by a gun-
man who purchased the address of his 
Florida home on the internet for a 
mere $1.95—$1.95. The gunshot missed 
his ear by less than 2 inches. 
Just last month, a judge’s address 
was circulated on social media, urging 
people to gather outside his home 
while the judge was hearing a high-pro-
file case. 
According to the U.S. Marshals Serv-
ice, threats against Federal judges rose 
by 500 percent between fiscal years 2015 
and 2019. This trend should worry all of 
us who care about our Constitution. An 
independent judiciary in which judges 
can render decisions without fear of 
retribution and violence is essential to 
the integrity of our democracy. 
Indeed, the idea that any judge at 
any level of government could be in-
timidated undermines the very concept 
of the rule of law. We expect all Ameri-
cans to have respect for the rule of law, 
even when they disagree with the out-
come of a case or a particular ruling. 
Unfortunately, that is not always the 
case. 
Some individuals delude themselves 
into believing that violence is the an-
swer. We may not be able to eliminate 
hatred from someone’s heart, but what 
we can do is make sure that the men 
and women who serve on our Federal 
bench do not make for such easy tar-
gets. That is why, after Daniel’s mur-
der, I made a personal commitment to 
Judge Salas. I told her that I would de-
velop legislation, along with my col-
league Senator BOOKER, to better pro-
tect the men and women who sit on our 
Federal judiciary, to ensure their inde-
pendence in the face of increased per-
sonal threats on judges, and to help 
prevent this unthinkable tragedy—un-
thinkable 
tragedy—from 
ever 
hap-
pening again to anyone else. 
The Daniel Anderl Judicial Security 
and Privacy Act of 2020 is a bipartisan, 
bicameral, and commonsense plan to 
safeguard the personal information of 
Federal judges and their families. And 
I want to thank my colleague Senator 
BOOKER, who has been there every step 
of the way, a member of the Judiciary, 
and 
Chairman 
GRAHAM—Senator 
LINDSEY GRAHAM—for leading this ef-
fort with me. 
Our legislation makes it unlawful for 
data brokers to knowingly sell, trade, 
license, purchase, or otherwise provide 
personally identifiable information of a 
Federal judge or their family. 
Since 
its 
introduction, 
we 
have 
worked with several stakeholders, in-
cluding the Administrative Office of 
the U.S. Courts, the U.S. Marshals Of-
fice, the American Civil Liberties 
Union, among others. Together, we 
carefully updated legislative language 
in order to uphold the First Amend-
ment right of the press to report on 
matters of public concern and balance 
that right with our urgent need to bet-
ter protect the safety of Federal judges 
and their families. 
Federal judges and their families will 
continue to be able to seek relief 
through the courts for the knowing and 
willful publication of their personal in-
formation, and the party responsible 
for the violation will have to pay the 
cost and reasonable attorney’s fees. 
The bill enjoys widespread support 
among judicial and attorney organiza-
tions, including the National Associa-
tion of Attorneys General, the Na-
tional Judicial Conference, the Federal 
Judges Association, the National Con-
ference of Bankruptcy Judges, the 
American Bar Association, the Na-
tional Hispanic Bar Association, the 
National Bar Association, and several 
others. 
America’s Federal judges must be 
able to render rulings without fearing 
for their lives or the lives of their loved 
ones. We must better protect Federal 
judges’ 
personal 
information 
from 
those who would seek to do them harm. 
That is exactly what the Daniel Anderl 
Judicial Security and Privacy Act of 
2020 will do. This legislation will not 
bring Judge Salas’s son back. But we 
must ensure, as Judge Salas said, that 
his death not be in vain. 
As she recently wrote in the New 
York Times, ‘‘Daniel’s death is speak-
ing to us, but will we listen? For the 
sake of my brothers and sisters on the 
bench, Congress must act now. Every 
day that goes by without action leaves 
our federal judges, our justice system 
and our very democracy in danger.’’ 
We must protect the independence of 
our courts, the safety of our judges, 
and prevent this sort of tragedy from 
ever happening again. This is a com-
monsense bill. It will save lives, and I 
urge my colleagues to approve it with-
out delay. 
Before I ask for consent, I want to 
turn to my distinguished colleague, the 
Senator from New Jersey, Mr. CORY 
BOOKER. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today in support of 
my senior Senator’s unanimous con-
sent request to pass the Daniel Anderl 
Judicial Security and Privacy Act. 
As Senator MENENDEZ pointed out, 
this is a bipartisan piece of legislation. 
It is bicameral. It will take important 
steps to safeguard the personally iden-
tifiable information of Federal judges 
and their family members from indi-
viduals who wish to do them harm. 
As Senator MENENDEZ
said, it is 
named after Daniel Anderl, the son of 
Judge Esther Salas and Mark Anderl, 
who was senselessly murdered in July 
of this year by a hate-filled gunman. 
The gunman was able to access per-
sonal information, as Senator MENEN-
DEZ said, by going to Judge Salas’s in-
formation, getting it—including where 
she lived, the routes she took to work, 
and even her place of worship and her 
home address. As a result, Judge Salas 
and her husband have gone through 
something that no parent ever, ever 
should have to go through. 
No person who takes on the responsi-
bility of serving as a Federal judge 
should ever have to live in fear that 
they or their family could be targeted 
by someone wishing to do them harm, 
who is able to easily access their per-
sonal information. Passing this bill 
today in memory and in honor of Dan-
iel Anderl will mark a commitment of 
this body to safeguarding the privacy 
and security of our Federal judges and 
their families so that we can make sure 
we are doing everything in our power 
to prevent this from happening to an-
other family. 
Our bill, as Senator MENENDEZ said, 
has broad support. It has been endorsed 
by the Administrative Office of the 
U.S. Courts, Federal Judges Associa-
tion, the Federal Magistrate Judges 
Association, the National Conference 
of Bankruptcy Judges, the Federal Bar 
Association, the National Association 
of Attorneys Generals, and others— 
people from all backgrounds, people 
from both parties, Independents. We 
have a unanimous chorus of support of 
people who believe that this is justice 
and will help keep judges safe. 
James C. Duff, the Administrative 
Director of the U.S. Courts, said in his 
statement of support of this bill: ‘‘It is 
crucial in our system of justice that 
judges can decide cases without fear for 
their safety and that of their family.’’ 
He is absolutely right. 
I echo Senator MENENDEZ’s request 
to pass the Daniel Anderl Judicial Se-
curity and Privacy Act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
as if in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Judiciary Com-
mittee be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 4711 and the Senate

S7526 
December 16, 2020 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; further that the Menendez sub-
stitute amendment at the desk be con-
sidered and agreed to; that the bill, as 
amended, be read a third time and 
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I agree that 
members of the judicial branch need 
better protection. In fact, I have been 
active in this issue for the last couple 
of years, and each time this has come 
forward, at the end of the year, with 
very little time to do the normal proc-
ess, I have advocated that an amend-
ment be added that would include pro-
tection of Members of Congress. I real-
ly think that it is important that we 
protect addresses for our judges, but it 
is also important that we do this for 
our elected officials. 
In recent years, what has happened 
has taught us that the legislative 
branch needs better protection as well. 
That was clear in 2011, when Congress-
woman Gabby Giffords was tragically 
shot while doing the most important 
part of the job—meeting with constitu-
ents. 
Words cannot express how happy and 
inspiring it was to see Congresswoman 
Giffords here in the Chamber as her 
husband, Senator KELLY, was recently 
sworn in as a Member of the body. But 
words also cannot express the pain felt 
by the family of the people who were 
killed and wounded that day. That 
should have been a wakeup call to bet-
ter protect Members of Congress and, 
in doing so, better protect the people 
around them. 
But just a few years later, a shooter 
nearly killed Congressman STEVE SCA-
LISE during baseball practice for the 
annual charity baseball game. I was 
there, and I said at the time that our 
lives were saved by the Capitol Hill po-
lice. Had they not been there, things 
might have gone much worse. 
But the Capitol Hill police are not 
stationed at our homes where our fami-
lies live while we serve in Washington. 
Extending the provision of this bill to 
the Members of Congress would better 
protect all of us—our families, our 
neighbors, and our constituents. 
It is a very minor request that I am 
asking. It is an amendment that would 
not change anything or lessen any-
thing about the bill. It is a very rea-
sonable request, and I don’t understand 
exactly why we can’t make this bill 
better by applying it to both judges 
and Members of Congress. 
My substitute amendment, which I 
will offer for unanimous consent, will 
make simple changes to the legisla-
tion. It would extend the same protec-
tions it would offer to the judicial 
branch to the legislative branch. 
Second, the laudable goal of this leg-
islation is to protect personally identi-
fiable information from being sold and 
posted online by data brokers. Allow-
ing at-risk individuals to file private 
action against data brokers for declar-
atory and injunctive relief, plus rea-
sonable attorney’s fees, will achieve 
that goal. 
I ask the Senator to modify his re-
quest to, instead, include my sub-
stitute amendment at the desk, and 
that my substitute amendment be con-
sidered and agreed to; the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motions 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right 
to object to the modification, I appre-
ciate the Senator’s concern to expand 
the universe of people covered by this 
bill, including Members of Congress. 
While that is a laudable goal, I person-
ally think it would be more appro-
priate to legislate that in another bill. 
This bill is for the Federal judiciary 
because of the special threats they face 
and the importance of ensuring their 
independence in terms of being able to 
make judgments based on the law and 
the facts, not upon some fear that 
lurks outside of their home or outside 
of their chambers. 
I also understand that the amend-
ment would strip out—and if I am 
wrong, I would be happy to be cor-
rected—would strip out the ability to 
seek redressing the court as it relates 
to the provision that we provide for 
judges. Without a threat of some dam-
ages, there is little incentive for a data 
broker to remove the personal identifi-
able information of a judge and his or 
her family. This is not about frivolous 
suits. This is about protecting the Fed-
eral judiciary. 
In addition to that, we had made sev-
eral good-faith efforts before we got to 
this point to address the concerns of 
my colleagues across the aisle. We ac-
tually had the Administrative Office of 
the U.S. Courts engage in conversa-
tions directly with our colleagues. 
My colleagues had concerns about a 
new grant program to States. Well, we 
changed that language to a report. 
Senator LEE was part of those con-
cerns. To better understand the proper 
Federal role, we changed it to a report. 
They don’t want to deal with some of 
the questions that we had for the U.S. 
marshals. Again, this is about pro-
tecting the Federal judiciary. Guess 
what branch protects the Federal judi-
ciary. The U.S. marshals. We changed 
that. 
It never seems to be enough. It never 
seems to be enough. It is unfortunate 
that the Federal judiciary will pay the 
price of this recalcitrance, but I can-
not, at this time, agree to the modi-
fication. Therefore, I object to it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the original request? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, I would like to offer across the 
aisle that we are willing to compromise 
with the Senator from New Jersey. We 
are willing to work with him on get-
ting the bill passed. The only thing 
that we would like to do is to have it 
include Congress, as well. 
The other points you had mentioned 
that you object to, as far as changing, 
I would be willing to discuss. I think 
there would be a middle ground. 
I think this could be passed. When we 
pass something unanimously, there has 
to be a little give and take. No one gets 
their way. I am not saying that you 
can’t have it. I am for your bill in gen-
eral. 
I think it ought to be expanded to 
Congress. We had at least two people 
shot. Gabby Giffords was shot. We had 
STEVE
SCALISE
shot. We had other 
threats. Congress is threatened and 
families are frightened. 
I don’t know about you, but, rou-
tinely, the sheriff and police have to 
come to our house for threats to my 
house. I am not alone. This happens to 
other people. There is no reason why 
we should do this only for one branch 
of government. They put the satellite 
picture of my House on the nightly 
news, basically pointing out where 
every crazy person in the world can go 
to find my house. 
We do need to do something. This 
isn’t a new request. I requested this a 
year ago when a very similar bill came 
up a year ago for special protections 
for the judiciary. I said, once again: 
Good idea, we should apply it to Con-
gress. 
We go forward a whole year, and now 
we are doing the same thing again, and 
nobody seems to be listening. 
I will tell you that I am willing to 
compromise on this and willing to 
work with you to pass it, but I think 
we should extend it. It is not that hard. 
If we extend it to Congress and flip it 
back, then, I think it would pass unani-
mously in the House, as well. But I ob-
ject to this version. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
just say to my colleague that I cer-
tainly am concerned about his safety 
and security and, for that fact, the 
safety and security of all of our col-
leagues. I appreciate his concern and 
understand it and look forward to 
working with him on that. 
I will say that the other elements 
that Senator LEE had incorporated into 
his amendment just renders the secu-
rity—whether for a Member of Con-
gress or for the judiciary—useless, in 
which case, I don’t want to give false 
security to anybody that they are 
being protected if, in fact, they don’t 
have the wherewithal to do so. 
I look forward to that opportunity. 
I promised Judge Salas that her son’s 
death will not be in vain. We may not 
have achieved this tonight with Sen-
ator BOOKER, but we are going to make 
this happen, hopefully, sooner rather 
than later. But we will make this hap-
pen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7527 
December 16, 2020 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, last 
week, I came to this floor on two sepa-
rate occasions with Senator SANDERS 
to talk about the need for direct assist-
ance to working families in my State— 
in the State of Missouri—and all across 
this country. I said that I was willing 
to use every tool at my disposal to 
make sure that this body acted to give 
direct assistance to working people in 
need as part of COVID relief. I said 
then, and I say it again today, that 
working people should be first in line 
for COVID relief, not last. They should 
be the first consideration, not some 
afterthought. 
I am pleased to report that we were 
told today, as negotiations are ongoing 
about a COVID relief bill, that direct 
assistance to working people and work-
ing families is in the bill, that working 
people will be getting assistance. 
I want to say once again here on this 
floor, as that package continues to 
take shape, how important it is that 
working families be able to count on 
some relief and how important it is for 
this body to prioritize working people 
over government, over big businesses, 
over government programs, and to give 
assistance directly to the people them-
selves. 
Look, people know how to spend 
their money and what is best for their 
own families. The quickest way to help 
people in need is to give them direct 
assistance and let them make the 
choices for their own families, for their 
own kids, not to have to wait in line 
for some program, not to have to talk 
to some bureaucrat but to be able to 
make their own choices direct, with as-
sistance that comes direct to them. 
That is going to be in this bill, I under-
stand. 
I am sure as heck going to continue 
to fight to see that it is in the bill and 
that any relief that is passed by the 
Senate prioritizes working people with 
direct relief. 
Some have questioned whether this is 
really necessary. Some have said: Well, 
it is not an emergency, and this bill is 
only for emergencies, and direct assist-
ance isn’t an emergency. 
To that I say: Is it not an emergency 
that working people are having to line 
up for food—literally, line up for food— 
in this country, in this day and age, be-
cause they don’t have enough money to 
go purchase nutrition for their own 
children? 
Just think about what is happening 
in my own State. 
Let me tell you about Monark Bap-
tist Church in Neosho, MO, down in 
Southwest Missouri. They had a food 
distribution program. They have done 
this for years, by the way, but as 
COVID intensified this past year, they 
stood up their efforts. Neighbors came 
together and donated. They got all the 
food that they could. They went out 
there in Neosho, MO—not a huge town. 
Monark Baptist Church went out and 
started distributing food. 
Do you know they distributed food to 
hundreds of families for hours. When 
they had run out of the food, there 
were over 50 cars—not individuals, 
cars. Fifty cars were still in line, as far 
as the eye could see, having driven 
miles and miles around from neigh-
boring counties to come for the help. 
These are working people. These are 
not folks who want some handout. 
These are working people. These are 
proud people. These are people who 
don’t want government to do stuff for 
them. They want to be able to get back 
up on their own feet and provide for 
themselves. 
Government shut down their busi-
nesses and took away their jobs this 
past year and put them in this position 
of, in some cases, outright desperation. 
Let me tell you about a gal from 
Kansas City, 22 years old. Her first 
name is Mars. I won’t share her last 
name just for her own privacy. You 
know, she has talked to me and told 
me about her plight. She moved to 
Kansas City earlier this year, right 
around the time the pandemic started. 
She got an apartment. She was getting 
set up and getting going. Then, the 
pandemic hit. Then, the shutdown hit. 
Then, she lost her job. Then, she lost 
her plumbing. The water wouldn’t 
work. She complained to the landlord. 
They wouldn’t do anything. The ceiling 
collapsed. The landlord wouldn’t do 
anything. Then she didn’t have enough 
money to make rent, and, the other 
day, she woke up with a 10-day eviction 
notice out on her front door. 
These are people who need help, not 
because they don’t know how to work 
but because they do know how to work 
and the government has put them in 
the position that they are facing today. 
This pandemic has put them in the po-
sition they are facing today. What they 
want is the ability to get back up on 
their own two feet and to provide for 
themselves by the work of their own 
hands. That is what direct assistance 
to working families will do. 
So to those who say it is not an 
emergency, I urge you to open your 
eyes and to look around at the people 
who are hurting, who are struggling, 
who are desperate for help. 
I have heard that it is said: Well, it is 
not stimulative. What a word—direct 
assistance isn’t stimulative, as if the 
American people are knobs and dials to 
be twisted and turned around to get a 
desired outcome, as if the economy is 
something to be micromanaged in 
Washington, DC. 
I am not interested in stimulus. I am 
interested in helping working people 
survive. I am not interested in micro-
managing this economy. I am inter-
ested in getting working people back 
up on their feet so they can manage 
their own lives. That is what this is 
about. That is why the need is so great. 
That is what we are trying to accom-
plish. 
We have a chance to do this, to get 
this done, to get accomplished here 
something that we can be proud of be-
fore Christmas, to send a message to 
the American people that they matter, 
to send a message to working people in 
my State and in every State in this 
Country that they matter and that we 
are here fighting for them; that we 
look forward to the day when they are 
back at work, ready to work, able to 
support themselves and their families, 
and that we are on the path to getting 
there. 
That is the message that we can 
send. That is the message that we must 
send. I will not leave this body until it 
is accomplished. 
I promise you this. If I have anything 
to say about it, we will not be leaving 
here before Christmas until direct as-
sistance is on the way to the working 
people of this Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
TRIBUTE TO TOM UDALL 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I want 
to take some time to thank and com-
mend my colleagues who are departing 
the Senate. All of these Members have 
devoted themselves to serving the Na-
tion and serving their States. We are 
all better off for their service. 
Let me begin with my friend and col-
league TOM UDALL. TOM inherited a 
family tradition of fighting for the 
American West and its citizens. His 
time in the Senate only added to the 
Udall legacy. 
TOM has been one of our Chamber’s 
leaders on conservation and the envi-
ronment. He championed the creation 
of monuments and worked to block the 
Trump administration’s harmful envi-
ronmental policies. And, this year, he 
helped secure permanent funding for 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, which was pioneered by TOM’s fa-
ther, Stewart Udall. 
TOM’s commitment to the health of 
our Nation’s environment has always 
been evident, and I was proud to hand 
off my role as the Democratic leader of 
the 
Senate 
Interior 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee to TOM in 2015. During 
his tenure, funding for the Interior ap-
propriations bill grew by 25 percent, 
and more than 100 anti-environmental 
riders were blocked. These victories 
would have been impossible without 
TOM’s ability to connect with his fel-
low Members and get things done. They 
are also a testament to TOM’s deep 
knowledge of America’s lands and re-
sources. 
Of course, TOM’s successes go beyond 
his 
environmental 
work. 
TOM
has 
worked tirelessly to ensure our Na-
tion’s Native Americans receive the re-
spect and support they are entitled to. 
He salvaged and ultimately passed bi-
partisan legislation updating the Toxic 
Substances Control Act for the first 
time since 1976, which was a big victory 
for public health. I was also pleased to 
work with TOM to pass legislation in 
2016 to help reduce and prevent suicide 
among adolescents and young adults. 
Finally, I am especially grateful for 
TOM’s efforts to increase resources for

the National Endowment for the Arts 
and the National Endowment for the 
Humanities. These Federal agencies 
are part of Rhode Island’s late and 
great Senator Claiborne Pell’s lasting 
legacy. They lift our spirits, tell our 
stories, and strengthen our sense of 
community. TOM’s work in advancing 
these agencies has enriched our coun-
try and helped bring so many people 
together. 
Thankfully, TOM has said that, while 
he is leaving the Senate, he is not re-
tiring from public service. I know New 
Mexico and our country are better off 
for that. I wish TOM and his family the 
best as they go forward. 
TRIBUTE TO DOUG JONES 
Madam President, let me turn now to 
my dear friend DOUG JONES. I have had 
the privilege to serve alongside DOUG 
JONES
both on the Armed Services 
Committee and the Banking Com-
mittee during his time in the Senate. 
DOUG has had a long and successful 
career helping those who need it most 
and doing what is right even if the 
price is. Yet I was still struck, time 
and again, by his dedication to the wel-
fare of our servicemembers and vet-
erans and their families—something I 
witnessed firsthand when we traveled 
together to visit servicemembers in 
Iraq and Afghanistan last year, and no-
where was DOUG’s commitment to 
these Americans more apparent than in 
last year’s National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. 
DOUG was greatly troubled that thou-
sands of Gold Star families were being 
unfairly shortchanged by certain laws 
related to survivor benefits. So, DOUG, 
like he has throughout his professional 
life, went to work to right an injustice. 
He introduced the bipartisan Military 
Widow’s Tax Elimination Act and was 
the Democratic lead on the Gold Star 
Family Tax Relief Act. I was proud to 
help DOUG
enact these bills, which 
allow military widows and widowers 
and their children to receive the full 
survivor benefits they are entitled to, 
as part of the fiscal year 2020 National 
Defense 
Authorization 
Act. 
DOUG’s 
work on these issues has directly im-
proved the lives of tens of thousands of 
Gold Star families who have given so 
much to our country. 
Naturally, DOUG worked hard again 
this year to shape the fiscal year 2021 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
and he shaped it for the better. The 
legislation includes a provision written 
by DOUG requiring a GAO audit of con-
tinuing efforts to ensure that racial 
and gender disparities in the military 
justice system are properly addressed 
and eliminated. He was also instru-
mental during the markup of the fiscal 
year 2021 NDAA when the committee 
voted to remove the names of confed-
erate soldiers from our military instal-
lations, and in the wake of the deadly 
shooting at Naval Air Station Pensa-
cola, DOUG met with the family of a 
slain Navy ensign, Kaleb Watson, and 
subsequently fought for two specific 
provisions in the fiscal year 2021 NDAA 
to require military installations to 
plan or conduct live emergency re-
sponse training events to help prevent 
such tragic shootings in the future. 
DOUG also continued his career-long 
fight for civil rights while in the Sen-
ate. He enacted the Civil Rights Cold 
Case Records Collection Act, which re-
quires the review and release of un-
solved civil rights case records to help 
deliver justice for the victims’ fami-
lies, and he has been a passionate de-
fender of voting rights for all Ameri-
cans. 
DOUG has never been afraid to take a 
difficult vote or to speak out for what 
is right. We will miss DOUG’s persist-
ence and conscientiousness in the Sen-
ate. I salute him and wish him well in 
his future endeavors. 
TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER 
Madam President, with respect to 
Chairman LAMAR ALEXANDER, biparti-
sanship and compromise are synony-
mous, and they have also always been 
central to the success of this institu-
tion. No one has been more of a con-
tributing factor to the successes we 
have had than LAMAR ALEXANDER, and 
he has embodied these principles dur-
ing his time in the Senate. 
I first had the privilege of working 
with him on the Joint Economic Com-
mittee and the Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee, which 
he now chairs, and we have spent many 
years serving together on the Appro-
priations Committee. 
LAMAR is focused more on getting 
things done than on making headlines. 
He worked across the aisle to pass 
landmark laws, including the Every 
Student Succeeds Act, the 21st Century 
Cures Act, and the SUPPORT for Pa-
tients and Communities Act. He and I 
also worked together to enact laws 
that reduce infant deaths and make 
children’s medications safer. These 
laws have improved the lives of count-
less Americans. They are a testament 
to LAMAR’s work ethic and the influ-
ence he has in the Senate. 
LAMAR has also not shied away from 
tackling contentious issues. I have al-
ways appreciated his willingness to 
take lonely positions, particularly with 
respect to his thoughtful work on mat-
ters such as immigration and govern-
ment shutdowns. 
I wish him well in the future. He has 
left an extraordinary legacy and exam-
ple for all of us. 
TRIBUTE TO PAT ROBERTS 
Madam President, PAT ROBERTS has 
had a distinguished career in both the 
Senate and the House of Representa-
tives. His work has touched on many 
issues, but he has been particularly 
dedicated to preserving the strength of 
our national defense and ensuring the 
well-being of our servicemembers. 
PAT’s concern for the defense of our 
Nation is longstanding. He began his 
public service as a young man in the 
U.S. Marine Corps, and he has dis-
played the steadfast resolve emblem-
atic of marines throughout his time in 
Congress. 
I observed this commitment first-
hand during our years serving and 
traveling together as part of the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee. PAT 
successfully pushed for the creation of 
a more modern refueling and transport 
tanker for our Air Force. He helped se-
cure improvements at Fort Leaven-
worth and created the first Senate cau-
cus exclusively dedicated to supporting 
the U.S. Marine Corps. 
As Chairman of the Dwight D. Eisen-
hower Memorial Commission, PAT ably 
led the effort to build a memorial to 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 
Washington, DC, and I am delighted 
that, after years of PAT’s hard work 
and leadership—and I observed this 
firsthand during my few years as a 
member of the Commission—the me-
morial was officially opened and dedi-
cated in September. That, too, will be 
a lasting tribute to PAT
ROBERTS’ 
work. 
Beyond his defense work, PAT was 
greatly concerned with the well-being 
of our farmers. He is the only Member 
to have authored and enacted farm 
bills in both the House and the Senate. 
We also worked closely together to 
pass legislation upgrading our Nation’s 
trauma centers to ensure that severely 
injured patients receive the best pos-
sible care. 
PAT was always quick with quips and 
brought levity to this body. I thank 
him for his spirit and his lifelong serv-
ice. 
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL B. ENZI 
Madam President, MIKE
ENZI
has 
long served the people of Wyoming 
with distinction. MIKE
and I spent 
many years working together on the 
Banking Committee and on the HELP 
Committee, which he chaired during 
some of my service on that committee. 
I have always appreciated his decency 
and thoughtfulness. 
He spent his time in the Senate ad-
vancing his ‘‘80–20‘‘ approach to legis-
lating. He sought to focus on the 80 
percent of issues, where both sides 
could come to an agreement, rather 
than on the 20 percent of issues where 
he felt an agreement was unreachable. 
He worked quietly behind the scenes to 
get things done, and he got things 
done. 
MIKE is one of the few U.S. Senators 
with an accounting background, and he 
and I worked closely together to bring 
greater awareness to financial literacy 
issues, as well as to create the Senate 
Financial Literacy Caucus to help 
Americans 
develop 
and 
maintain 
healthy financial habits. 
I am also especially grateful for 
MIKE’s support for legislation I led in 
2010 updating museum and library serv-
ices to better meet the needs of Ameri-
cans. As the then-ranking member of 
the HELP Committee, MIKE played a 
pivotal role in securing the law’s pas-
sage. 
Our work together was of great im-
portance, and I will miss his thought-
fulness and determination. I wish MIKE 
well in all of his future endeavors.

December 16, 2020 
TRIBUTE TO CORY GARDNER 
Madam President, I also want to rec-
ognize CORY GARDNER. While we never 
served on the same committee, I had 
the pleasure of working with him on a 
number of issues. 
We were able to come together with a 
group of our colleagues and pass a law 
designating 9–8-8 as a national suicide 
prevention and mental health crisis 
hotline. The designation will make it 
easier for people to access this criti-
cally important lifeline when they 
really need it. I thank CORY for his 
partnership and leadership on this 
issue. 
CORY also worked diligently to secure 
the passage of the Great American Out-
doors Act last summer. This law per-
manently funds the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund and addresses a 
maintenance backlog on Federal parks 
and public lands. The Great American 
Outdoors Act is a real victory for the 
environment and conservation. 
I thank CORY for his service and wish 
him the best as he leaves the Senate. 
TRIBUTE TO MARTHA MCSALLY 
Madam President, I also want to 
thank MARTHA MCSALLY for her service 
in this Chamber. MARTHA is a veteran 
of the Air Force and has always been a 
fighter. In fact, when you say ‘‘veteran 
of the Air Force,’’ you are really under-
stating her role in the Air Force. She 
fought to become the first American 
woman to fly a fighter jet in combat. 
She fought to become the first Amer-
ican woman to command a fighter 
squadron in combat, and she continued 
fighting while a Member of the U.S. 
Senate. 
Indeed, 
MARTHA
was a steadfast 
champion for the well-being of our 
servicemembers, military families, and 
veterans during her time on the Armed 
Services Committee. She worked to in-
clude language in the fiscal year 2020 
National Defense Authorization Act 
improving the effectiveness of sexual 
assault investigations in the military 
and strengthening support for victims. 
MARTHA also played a key role in 
helping enact over 30 provisions in the 
fiscal year 2020 NDAA to address the 
systemic crisis of privatized housing 
and help remedy the mistreatment of 
military families, and she teamed with 
Senators TESTER and SULLIVAN to pass 
legislation enhancing the tools the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs uses to 
meet the mental health needs of vet-
erans. These accomplishments are only 
a few examples of the important work 
MARTHA did here, but they illustrate 
her 
wholehearted 
commitment 
to 
bettering the lives of those who do so 
much for our country. 
I attribute all of this great success 
and achievement—first woman fighter 
pilot, first woman to lead a squadron in 
combat, and more—to a simple reason. 
MARTHA was born and raised in War-
wick, RI, right next to my hometown 
of Cranston, RI. MARTHA’s close rel-
ative was the mayor of Cranston. My 
dad worked as a custodian in the 
school system. He respected, admired, 
and was a friend of Jim Taft. MARTHA’s 
father was also one of the most re-
spected lawyers in Rhode Island, some-
one who was a tenacious and bright 
lawyer. That tradition is carried on by 
her brother Mark, whom I had the 
privilege and pleasure to know while I 
was practicing law in Rhode Island. 
It is a wonderful family, and she has 
brought great distinction to not only 
the Senate, to not only the State of Ar-
izona, but also to the State of Rhode 
Island. I wish her the very best going 
forward. 
TRIBUTE TO KAMALA HARRIS 
Madam 
President, 
finally, 
while 
KAMALA HARRIS is not leaving the Sen-
ate entirely, I would like to take a mo-
ment to recognize and thank her as she 
moves to her new role as Vice Presi-
dent of the United States and, accord-
ing to the Constitution, as President of 
this body. 
KAMALA is relentlessly determined to 
help and support the most vulnerable 
Americans. She has helped lead the 
charge to protect Dreamers, expand 
healthcare coverage, and reform our 
criminal justice system. KAMALA dedi-
cated her Senate tenure to policies 
that make America a more equitable 
country and ensure equal opportunities 
and rights for communities of color. 
KAMALA is also a former prosecutor, 
and she brought a prosecutor’s inci-
siveness and grit with her to this body. 
She led the case against many of the 
Trump administration’s most harmful 
policies and nominees, and I know she 
will bring that tenacity to the Office of 
Vice President of the United States. 
I also know that she will help guide 
and heal our Nation as we continue to 
combat the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I wish her well as she begins her new 
role, and I look forward to working 
with her and President-Elect Biden to 
meet the many challenges before us. 
To all of my colleagues who are de-
parting the Senate, I give you my 
greatest respect and admiration for 
your service to your States, to the Sen-
ate, and to the United States of Amer-
ica. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that

standing

that 
the 
postcloture time on the Atchley nomi-
nation expire at 11:30 a.m., Thursday,

table and the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO LINDA BEHNKEN 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
getting toward the end of the week 
here. We still have got a lot of work to 
do in the U.S. Senate, particularly on a 
relief package and end-of-the-year ap-
propriations. So we are working hard 
on that. 
But I also want to take the oppor-
tunity, given it is the end of the week, 
to do what I consider one of my favor-
ite activities of the entire week each 
week in the Senate, and that is talking 
about someone in my State who is 
making a difference, helping out our 
communities and making Alaska one 
of the best States—the best State, in 
my view—in the country. This is the 
individual we call the Alaskan of the 
Week. 
So I want to do an acknowledgment 
to some of our Hill reporters who have 
taken an interest in the ‘‘Alaskan of 
the Week’’ each week. I think some-
times because they recognize it is fin-
ishing up the week. We are not yet 
done yet, though. We have a lot of 
work to do. But I also appreciate them 
reporting on it because it is just good 
to see stories about people who are 
doing good work for their State and 
their community. 
What we try to do with this series, 
which we have been doing now for a 
number of years, is to talk about peo-
ple who don’t always get the recogni-
tion that they deserve, people who are 
making a big difference. You know, 
Alaska, like really every other State in 
the country, is experiencing serious 
challenges right now as a result of 
COVID–19, but I am confident, just like 
the rest of the country, we will get 
through this more resilient than ever. 
We have a saying. I certainly love 
this saying: Tough times don’t last, but 
tough people do. Americans, Alaskans, 
North Dakotans are tough, and we are 
going to get through this. 
I would like to introduce our Alaskan 
of the Week, Linda Behnken, from the 
gorgeous city of Sitka, AK, in South-
east Alaska. The ‘‘Paris of the Pa-
cific,’’ it is called, Sitka. A fun fact 
about Sitka, it is the largest city in 
the United States by land area, encom-
passing over 4,800 square miles, includ-
ing water. That is big. The population 
is fairly big for our State. It is beau-
tiful. If you haven’t been to Sitka, you 
have got to go. It is gorgeous. 
Now, Linda—boy, talk about Linda. 
Linda is innovative, caring, and she 
has a deep and abiding commitment to 
our great State, her community, and to 
the profession that she has devoted her 
life to, one that is revered and so im-
portant in Alaska, and that is commer-
cial fishing. 
For more than 30 years now, Linda 
has been on a boat catching fish out of 
Alaska’s waters. It is the best seafood, 
mind you, in the world. No doubt about 
that one—wild Alaskan seafood. Not 
only is she a successful fisherman, 
which is, of course, a full-time job, she 
has also worked to ensure that Alaska 
continues to have sustainable fisheries.

We are what I call the superpower of 
seafood. Over 60 percent of all fish 
caught in the United States is har-
vested in Alaska’s waters—6–0. That is 
huge. But we need to make sure we 
have oceans that are clean and sustain-
able and that the profession is safe and 
small fishermen can thrive and the 
young fishermen can enter the profes-
sion. That is what Linda has been fo-
cused on for her entire career in Alas-
ka. 
So for this work and so much more, 
including a huge role in helping needy 
families, particularly during this pan-
demic, Linda was recently awarded the 
prestigious Heinz Award for the Envi-
ronment, named after the late U.S. 
Senator John Heinz. It is a very pres-
tigious award. 
Here is the thing. Linda didn’t even 
apply for it. She didn’t seek it. She was 
sought out and I believe shocked when 
she found out she received this very 
prestigious award that comes with a 
$250,000 cash prize. Now, that is a big 
deal. I will say more about that cash 
prize in a minute. 
Let me tell you a bit about Linda’s 
story and how she came to be such a 
passionate steward of our fisheries, of 
our sea, and of our ocean. Born and 
raised in Connecticut, Linda headed to 
Alaska in 1982 during a summer break 
from college. She wanted to make 
some money. She heard that one of the 
ways she could do it was to fish in the 
great State of Alaska. 
She took a ferry from Bellingham, 
WA, to Sitka, and she immediately fell 
in love with this gorgeous—and I mean 
gorgeous—community the minute she 
got off the boat. It took her about a 
month pounding the docks to find a 
deckhand job. There weren’t a lot of 
women in this business then. She did 
eventually find not just a job but a 
wonderful community. 
‘‘The fishing community,’’ she said, 
‘‘is full of independent and resourceful 
people who are really there for each 
other’’ in their times of need. She also 
described how, when the fishing was 
done or when it was bad weather, peo-
ple would gather around the docks. 
Some would light up the grill. Some 
would bring pie, a loaf of bread. Instru-
ments would come out. Stories were 
told. Kids played. Linda said: ‘‘I found 
a sense of community that I really 
hadn’t [found]’’ anywhere else. 
So she loved it. She went back to the 
lower 48 to finish her undergraduate 
degree, but Alaska was always with 
her. She knew that she had found a 
home and a mission to help create 
more sustainable fisheries in the great 
State of Alaska. 
To that end, she enrolled in a mas-
ter’s degree program in resource devel-
opment at Yale and then came back to 
Alaska. 
‘‘What I saw going on in the ocean 
drove me to . . . graduate school.’’ 
During that time, in the 1980s, she said 
that the way the fishing was managed 
wasn’t working well for the smaller 
fishermen, nor was there much of an 
emphasis back then on sustainability. 
When she came back to Alaska, she 
began to fish again, eventually buying 
her own small commercial fishing boat, 
which she now fishes with her husband 
and two sons who have themselves been 
fishing since a very, very young age. 
I have always said that the Alaskan 
fisherman is the quintessential small 
business 
man 
and 
small 
business 
woman. It is often family businesses. 
They take huge risks. They create a 
great product. They work hard as can 
be. They are the quintessential small 
business men and women in America, 
and Linda proves the point. 
She became the executive director of 
the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Asso-
ciation, which is an alliance of small- 
boat commercial fishermen committed 
to sustainable and safe fisheries. 
Let me talk about safety on our 
waters in Alaska. Fishing, particularly 
in Alaska’s waters, is one of the most 
dangerous jobs out there. Linda has 
had many harrowing stories—caught 
out fishing in the frigid waters for 
hours in the center of storms, man 
overboard, challenges, wind whisking 
away equipment. But all in all, it is 
much safer now than it used to be when 
Linda first started to fish. Then, when 
a certain fishery opened, everyone 
rushed out at once to get as much fish 
as possible regardless of the conditions. 
That has changed. Now fishing is a 
safer—but still dangerous—business in 
my great State. 
Linda was also involved in limiting 
bigger commercial vessels from oper-
ating in the waters of Southeast Alas-
ka and worked for more stringent envi-
ronmental regulations on the cruise 
ship industry. 
Among other things related to fish-
eries, she served 9 years on the North 
Pacific Fishery Management Council 
and is a founding member of the Alas-
ka Sustainable Fisheries Trust, which 
promotes Alaska seafood, helps young-
er men and women enter the field, and 
helps feed the hungry from the bounty 
of the sea—all of which contributed to 
her winning the Heinz Award. 
This pandemic that we are experi-
encing has negatively impacted so 
many lives, but it has also brought out 
some of the best in us in Alaska and in 
America, people across the country, 
reaching out to their neighbors, volun-
teering their time to do as much as 
they can. 
This includes Linda. When she read 
early on in the pandemic that a gro-
cery store in her area stopped accept-
ing checks, she got to work. Working 
with her groups, the Alaska Sustain-
able Fisheries Trust and the Alaska 
Longline 
Fishermen’s 
Association, 
they began delivering food—fish—to 
people’s doors, locally caught and proc-
essed seafood to those who were in 
need. 
So far—get this—with their partners, 
they have provided over 400,000 pounds 
of 
delicious 
Alaska 
seafood. 
They 
brought in 400,000 pounds—wow—to 
children’s 
programs, 
food 
pantries, 
women’s shelters, Tribal organizations, 
and military organizations. You get 
the picture. She is working hard. They 
have done amazing work. And I want to 
thank her and so many who worked 
with her for this great effort. 
Something else that Linda did, a de-
cision she made for her community. 
Earlier, I spoke about that cash prize 
that came with the Heinz Award— 
$250,000. She took $100,000 of that 
money, which was her prize money, and 
donated it back to the organization 
that she helped found, the Alaska Sus-
tainable Fisheries Trust, to work on 
sustainable fisheries, combating cli-
mate change, and to help young fisher-
men enter the profession so we have 
sustainable fisheries going forward. 
I am sure Linda probably heard the 
good news: Our legislation, my legisla-
tion, the Save Our Seas 2.0 legislation 
to clean up our oceans passed the Sen-
ate recently and is on its way to the 
President’s desk for his signature. 
More good news. 
As she said: ‘‘We won’t have jobs if 
we don’t take care of our fisheries.’’ 
Keep them sustainable ‘‘and get young 
people into the profession.’’ People like 
Linda—committed, organized, generous 
of spirit, hard-working, in love with 
what she does in her State and her 
community—will get us through this 
pandemic. These are the people in 
Alaska, in America. And it is people 
like her that will also ensure that 
Alaska remains the superpower of sea-
food, not just for America but for the 
world. 
So, Linda, for all that you do, for all 
that you are going to continue to do, 
thank you, thank you, thank you. 
Great work, and congratulations on 
being our Alaskan of the Week. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
WESTERN SAHARA AND ABRAHAM ACCORDS 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, 6 days 
ago, on the 10th, I came down to the 
floor after having discovered some-
thing that happened. I think it really 
was not intentional the way it hap-
pened, but I would like to share that 
with you and share the frustration that 
I have. 
There is a situation that is taking 
place and has taken place for 30-some 
years in Western Sahara. This is an 
area where after a colonial period, the 
different colonies in there were at-
tached to other countries. In the case 
of Western Sahara, that actually had 
been attached to Spain. It was called 
Spanish Sahara at that time. This was 
way back in pre-1966. One of the many 
good things that President Trump has 
done is that he has put together this 
program called the Abraham accords, 
and that is bringing the Arab popu-
lation and the Jewish population in the 
Middle East together. This is some-
thing that Presidents have tried to do 
for a long period of time—both Demo-
crat and Republican, not successful. 
And this has become successful because 
the thing that was announced just 6 
days ago was that Morocco was going 
to salvage a relationship with Israel.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7531 
December 16, 2020 
I don’t know how many or what kind 
of detail went into that, but, inadvert-
ently, I think, they agreed to some-
thing that Morocco has been trying to 
do for a long period of time, and that 
is, to have the United States recognize 
that they have rights to the land that 
is known as Western Sahara. 
Now, as for Western Sahara, back 
after the colonial days, they started 
getting their independence in various 
parts of that world. They had been at-
tached to Spain at that time. Well, 
anyway, what the President did—and I 
say I think this was inadvertently 
done—was to give Morocco claims to 
the land that rightly belongs to the 
Western Saharans. 
Now, I think that he could have se-
cured the agreement with Morocco 
without giving away and reversing 45 
years of our longstanding foreign pol-
icy. 
Now, I have to confess that when I 
came down to the floor last week, I was 
feeling shocked and deeply saddened by 
the announcement. The news about the 
United States recognizing Morocco’s 
claim over Western Sahara took me by 
surprise because I had been involved in 
that issue for a long period of time. 
And we have had a policy in the United 
States since pre-1966 that we firmly 
supported the rights of the Saharans— 
the Western Sahara people—to their 
own land that was taken unfairly from 
them. 
Now, this came as a surprise to me, 
and I came down to the floor. That was 
6 days ago. And I want to tell you what 
has happened since that time, just to 
refresh the memory of those individ-
uals. 
There are a lot of people out there 
who are concerned about this. 
Remember what happened histori-
cally and kind of a chronology of what 
happened in Western Sahara. First of 
all, in 1966, the United Nations General 
Assembly resolution agreed that a res-
olution of self-determination should be 
held, and that is, to allow the United 
Nations endorsing the idea that a reso-
lution of self-determination be made 
for the population of Western Sahara. 
That was 1966, and we are in full agree-
ment with that here in the United 
States. 
Then, because of the fact that Mo-
rocco was trying to claim some owner-
ship of the land that belonged to the 
people of Western Sahara, in 1975 the 
International Court of Justice denied 
Morocco the right to territory of West-
ern Sahara. Now, this was the Inter-
national Court of Justice. That is sup-
posed to be a final thing. 
And Morocco then invaded Western 
Sahara. Now, keep in mind that you 
have Morocco—a very, very wealthy 
country with all kinds of resources— 
taking on a group of people who had 
been sent out of their homes, out and 
living in the bush. I have been there 
several times. The conditions are just 
not livable conditions. And then, of 
course, they were invaded by Morocco 
as a result of the International Court 
of Justice decision. 
Then, in 1991, the U.N. ceasefire mis-
sion began to provide a referendum of 
self-determination. 
So 
that 
is 
the 
United Nations coming in again and 
saying that they need to have the right 
of self-determination. That is some-
thing that was restated over and over 
again. Well, that was a ceasefire in 1991 
that was supposed to stop all kinds of 
brutality and the bad things that were 
going on in that part of the world. 
I became very close, many years ago, 
with James Baker. James Baker, back 
during the Bush 1 administration, was 
Secretary of State, and he was Sec-
retary of Treasury, and he took this 
on, back during the first Bush adminis-
tration, as a personal thing. He went 
and became familiar with this and 
tried to put together a special envoy to 
Western Sahara and worked at it for a 
long period of time. James Baker is 
still around and still committed. 
I remember when I called James 
Baker—this was several years ago—and 
I said: I have been watching what you 
did—what you tried to do—in Western 
Sahara to free these people up, and I 
just want you to know that I have been 
there, I have seen it, and I agree with 
you, and I want to get your advice as 
to how we can best make this happen. 
All we want is a referendum of self-de-
termination so people can decide for 
themselves what they want their land 
to be a part of. 
So James Baker responded to me, 
and he said: That was one of the very 
few failures that we had during that 
administration. 
He said: I was Secretary of State, and 
I worked hard on it and did everything 
I could, and I feel sorry. I wish you the 
best of luck. 
Well, then, in 2004, the United States 
and Morocco signed a free-trade agree-
ment. This is interesting because we 
signed the free-trade agreement with 
Morocco, and the agreement explic-
itly—explicitly—excluded Western Sa-
hara because Morocco does not have 
sovereignty over it. So they agreed. 
They signed the same thing that we 
signed saying that that land did not be-
long to Morocco, and it was specifi-
cally agreed that it be excluded. That 
was the United States and Morocco 
way back in 2004. 
So you have, in 1966, the United Na-
tions making that declaration. In 1975, 
the International Court of Justice de-
nied the right of the territory to Mo-
rocco; 1991, the ceasefire; 1997; then 
again, in 2004, the United States and 
Morocco signing a free-trade agree-
ment—which all of this was agreed to. 
So this isn’t news for me. I have been 
involved in this issue for decades, as 
well, and I have visited the refugee 
camps in that area. About 10 years ago, 
I met with Aminatou Haidar. It was 
someone who would become well recog-
nized and some of the abuses that had 
been taking place for a long time. She 
was here in Washington and came to 
my office. She is from that area, and 
she was here to accept an award from 
the Robert F. Kennedy Center for 
Human Rights for her work on behalf 
of her people in Western Sahara. I re-
member her so well. 
She had been arrested by Morocco for 
demonstrating peacefully in Western 
Sahara. She was in prison for 4 years. 
She was blindfolded the entire time for 
4 years, and she was tortured and treat-
ed terribly, and she lost her eyesight as 
a result of that. And all that was for 
peacefully protesting on behalf of her 
homeland. 
But it didn’t stop her work. She kept 
fighting for her people, even facing ar-
rest again. Additionally, 15 years ago, I 
did something that is kind of unusual 
here in Washington. People don’t real-
ize this—that Members of the House 
and the Senate don’t always testify be-
fore the other body. And 15 years ago, 
they were having a hearing in the 
House on international affairs, and I 
asked if I could be a witness. So I went 
there and testified, and I gave the his-
tory that is similar to what I just stat-
ed—the history of what has been going 
on there—and why the referendum for 
self-determination was so necessary. 
But I also called out a hidden part of 
this, and that is the lobbyists. You 
know, it seems like every time some-
one has a cause that is unjust, they go 
and hire all the lobbyists in Wash-
ington. We are having that right now 
with an organization in another sub-
ject area. But at that time, that was 
2005, and at that time, the following 
lobbyists had been hired by Morocco: 
the Livingston Group, Tew Cardenas, 
Edelman public relations, Miller & 
Chevalier, Gabriel and company, Rob-
ert Holley, and Whiton Case. Those are 
seven lobbyists that were hired by Mo-
rocco. 
And 
now, 
that 
hasn’t 
changed. 
Today, right now, they are represented 
by JPC Strategies, Third Circle, and 
Neale Creek, and average over $1 mil-
lion each year. 
So all these lobbyists in Washington 
have been hired by Morocco. And whom 
do the Western Saharans have to lift 
up their voices? They have no one—no 
one at all. 
So, given my personal history, you 
can forgive me for being shocked and 
deeply saddened at having their future 
so harshly stolen from them after they 
spent three generations waiting for the 
promise of a referendum for self-deter-
mination. 
I have to say this. I am quite sure 
that our President was not even aware 
of that. He is doing the right thing in 
terms of the accords that we are doing 
in that part of the world, bringing the 
Arabs and the Jews together. It is a 
good thing. But this is an issue that 
should never have come up or been a 
part of it, and I am quite sure that he 
was not aware of this. 
So now, seeing the reactions around 
the world, it is clear that there is kind 
of a silver lining. I look at this as an 
opportunity. It is an issue that people 
are worn out on. We tried and tried and 
tried everything we could think of. And 
just from my coming to the floor 6

December 16, 2020 
days ago, all these things have hap-
pened since that time. People have a 
new hope. 
And remember, the conflict in West-
ern Sahara is what we used to call a 
frozen, forgotten conflict. That has a 
finality to it. There is something about 
a ‘‘frozen conflict,’’ you know—that 
nothing more is going to happen. They 
called it a frozen conflict and made it 
easy for the rest of the world to let the 
status quo continue, leaving the West-
ern Saharan people in limbo, waiting 
for a referendum that had been prom-
ised way back in 1966. 
The forgotten conflict allowed Mo-
rocco to continue encroaching and get-
ting away with human rights abuses 
like the one I just described—torturing 
that young lady for 4 years, causing 
her to go blind. So those were the unin-
tended consequences of this arrange-
ment that was made with Morocco. 
So it has never been so clear to the 
international community. I have never 
seen the international community so 
united. Everybody is on our side on 
this thing—the side that we have had 
and will return to for some 30 years. 
The African Union said—this is just 
since the last 6 days: ‘‘The position of 
the African Union remains unchanged, 
in conformity with relevant AU’’—that 
is the African Union—‘‘and United Na-
tions resolutions.’’ 
On the United Nations: ‘‘The United 
Nations said Thursday its position was 
‘unchanged’ on the disputed Western 
Sahara region after the United States 
recognized 
Morocco’s 
sovereignty 
there.’’ 
That is the United Nations coming 
back again. 
In a news article, the European 
Union indicated last Thursday that 
‘‘the status of Western Sahara has not 
been determined and must be nego-
tiated in a process led by the United 
Nations, after the President of the 
United States, Donald Trump, has rec-
ognized the Moroccan sovereignty.’’ 
So the European Union is in full 
agreement with what we are about to 
try to do again. 
The United Kingdom said: ‘‘Our posi-
tion on the status of Western Sahara 
remains unchanged.’’ 
It didn’t change them a bit what we 
did here in the United States. 
Algeria. Algeria is right next door. I 
meant to bring a map down here to fa-
miliarize everyone with the area that 
we are talking about. Algeria said: 
‘‘The conflict of Western Sahara is a 
question of decolonization which can 
only be resolved through the applica-
tion of the international law and the 
well-established charter of the United 
Nations and the African Union in this 
matter, which provides for the authen-
tic exercise by the Sahrawi people of 
their inalienable right to self-deter-
mination and independence.’’ 
That is Algeria. And, by the way, 
every one of the 52 nations in Africa is 
in full agreement with what we are 
talking about right now. 
And James Baker hasn’t gone away. 
This is way back in the first Bush ad-
ministration. He was Secretary of 
State. This is his statement just the 
other day—yesterday, it was. He said: 
While I strongly support the Abraham Ac-
cords, the proper way to implement them 
was the way it was done with the UAE, Bah-
rain and Sudan, and not by cynically trading 
off the self-determination rights of the peo-
ple of Western Sahara. I agree with Senator 
JAMES INHOFE— 
That is me— 
when he characterized this development as 
‘‘shocking and deeply disappointing.’’ It 
would appear that the United States of 
America, which was founded first and fore-
most on the principle of self-determination, 
has walked away from that principle regard-
ing the people of Western Sahara. This is 
very regrettable. 
That is James Baker. 
Even more, these are other opinions. 
These are opinion pieces. This came 
out, and I just read them this morning. 
David Keene—we all remember David 
Keene. He was with the Washington 
Times. He was with the American Con-
servative Union and with the NRA. His 
quote was this: 
The United States has sometimes quite 
properly, given our interests, stayed out of 
controversies like this, but one is hard 
pressed to find another situation in which we 
have 
virtually 
announced 
that 
justice 
doesn’t matter and that those like the West-
ern Saharans who have sought their rights 
peacefully rather than [by way] . . . [of] ter-
rorism and . . . [guns] are fools. 
John Bolton, in Foreign Policy, said: 
[T]he Polisario is at a crucial juncture. It 
would be fully justified if it chooses to re-
turn to the battlefield, but much depends on 
the positions of Algeria, Mauritania and oth-
ers—and what resources are available. 
Now, that gets back to the question 
of resources. We have unlimited re-
sources by the very wealthy nation— 
one of the wealthiest nations in the 
world, Morocco. 
Stephen Zunes—I got to know him a 
long time ago. He is a scholar with the 
University of San Francisco. He spe-
cializes in this area. This is his quote 
just in the last 2 days: 
Morocco’s claim on Western Sahara is re-
jected by the United Nations, the World 
Court, the African Union and a broad con-
sensus of international legal scholars that 
consider the region a non-self-governing ter-
ritory that must be allowed an act of self-de-
termination. This is why no country had for-
mally recognized Morocco’s takeover—until 
now. 
This is still Stephen Zunes. He said: 
‘‘Human Rights Watch, Amnesty Inter-
national and other reputable human 
rights groups have documented wide-
spread suppression of peaceful, pro- 
independence activists by Moroccan oc-
cupation 
forces, 
including 
torture, 
beatings, detention without trial and 
extrajudicial killings. 
Still quoting the scholar, Stephen 
Zunes: 
‘‘Since 
the 
Polisario’’— 
Polisario, of course, are those fighting 
for their freedom and for their rec-
lamation. ‘‘Since the Polisario pro-
claimed 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in 
1976, 84 countries have recognized West-
ern Sahara as an independent state.’’ 
Everybody agrees with this. It is one 
of the few things in foreign policy 
where there is no opposition. They all 
agree with that self-determination for 
the Western Sahara people. 
I am so saddened by the betrayal to-
ward the people of Western Sahara for 
unilaterally 
recognizing 
Morocco’s 
claim. Yet I am seeing the unexpected 
results from the proclamation. 
If highlighting the injustice of these 
people pushes the rest of the world to 
finally get them the referendum they 
deserve, it may be worth it, and that is 
what I am seeing right now. I remem-
ber so well—it has now been some three 
or 
four 
generations 
of 
Western 
Saharans and the little kids you see in 
the camps, in the refugee camps, living 
under conditions that we can’t even 
imagine in this country, but they are 
happy little kids. They carry around a 
sign. I don’t have the pronunciation in 
their language, but it says: ‘‘We will 
fight till we get back our homes.’’ 
These are little kids. They all know— 
the fourth generation of those who 
have been abandoned. 
So I remember—and I called, and I 
found out—what was the year? Was it 
2007? Yes, in 2007, Mark Powers and I— 
he has been with me on a lot of things 
in Africa that we have been interested 
in. He and I met with all of the elected 
leaders of the Western Saharans in a 
room that is out in the desert. We ac-
tually heard all their stories. They are 
all Muslims out there, and we all 
prayed together. We prayed to the Lord 
for mercy in this case. And I think that 
maybe it is closer than we thought it 
was. 
That is what is happening right now. 
It is something that—we have to move 
back to our original position that we 
have held since 1966 in supporting peo-
ple—the right for a referendum of self- 
determination. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7533 
December 16, 2020 
of bipartisan work, with input from all 
of our veteran service organizations, 
dozens of Senators and Members of the 
House of Representatives, our partners 
at the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
and the leadership of the former Senate 
and House VA Committee chairmen, 
Senator Isakson and Congressman ROE. 
Among its many provisions, this leg-
islation invests in the education and 
employment of veterans to make cer-
tain they have the tools necessary to 
achieve success after service through 
expanded opportunities to use their 
earned benefits for longer periods of 
time and more opportunities for job 
training. 
This bill will also give the VA the 
tools necessary to serve veterans at 
risk of homelessness in a more mean-
ingful way during the pandemic and re-
quire the VA to provide greater over-
sight and support to our State vet-
erans’ homes. 
It also includes provisions from the 
Deborah Sampson Act, a landmark bill 
that makes clear women who serve 
their country in the Armed Forces 
must have a VA that is as effective for 
them as it is for the men who also have 
served. 
As I mentioned, this bill is named 
after two public servants. Johnny Isak-
son was my predecessor as chairman, 
and I have worked hard to follow his 
example of bipartisanship in working 
with our VA Committee ranking mem-
ber, Senator JON TESTER. Legislation 
like this bill is the result of many 
months of work by members of our 
staff, stemming from a desire from 
both sides of the aisle to better serve 
our Nation’s veterans. The important 
relationships that exist between Sen-
ators, our House colleagues, and our 
staff members result in a bipartisan so-
lution like the one that passed the 
House today and that passed the Sen-
ate just a few days before. 
I would also like to thank Dr. PHIL 
ROE. I served with him in the House of 
Representatives. He is the current 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
ranking member and its former chair-
man. I thank him for his partnership 
and his friendship as we worked to-
gether to serve veterans, since we both 
served on that committee in the House 
together. 
The VA is making positive, measur-
able changes to better serve our vet-
erans, and Congressman ROE and Sen-
ator Isakson deserve credit not only for 
being a big part of that change but also 
for being an example for the rest of us 
as to how we can work across the aisle 
and across the Capitol to improve the 
lives of our country’s veterans and all 
of our fellow citizens. 
I would also like to recognize Con-
gressman ROE’s counterpart, House VA 
Committee Chairman TAKANO, for see-
ing this bill to completion in the House 
of Representatives today. 
I would like to thank my counterpart 
in the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee, Ranking Member JON TESTER, 
the Senator from Montana, for his hard 
work this past year in helping to lead 
our committee’s efforts to do the right 
thing for our Nation’s veterans. This 
bill is a testament to his dedication to 
serving our veterans and to his staff’s 
tireless work on veterans’ behalf. 
One more thank-you certainly rests 
with our SVAC members for providing 
so many legislative solutions to issues 
that we have heard from the VA, from 
our VSOs and from veterans in each of 
our home States. I know that making 
certain our veterans continue to re-
ceive care and benefits was foremost in 
their minds during this pandemic, and 
I would like to thank Senators BOOZ-
MAN, CASSIDY, ROUNDS, TILLIS, SUL-
LIVAN, BLACKBURN, CRAMER, LOEFFLER, 
and each of our Democratic colleagues 
on the committee for their contribu-
tion to this landmark legislation. 
Our veteran service organizations 
often speak for veterans who cannot 
speak for themselves, and they help 
Members of this body understand the 
issues and concerns that veterans may 
be facing across the country in addi-
tion to our own home States. I thank 
all of the VSOs that have worked on 
this bill, for many years in many cases, 
meeting with me and with our com-
mittee staff, explaining issues and 
working closely with us to make cer-
tain we find the right solutions for our 
Nation’s veterans. I hope each VSO— 
veteran service organization—and its 
members will benefit from this legisla-
tion following the President’s signa-
ture. I hope they will benefit for dec-
ades to come. 
Finally, I want to thank our team at 
the Senate VA Committee for every-
thing they have put into this legisla-
tion. 
Thank you to Senator TESTER’s staff 
for all of your thoughtful work draft-
ing the language to help address real 
issues that impact real veterans. 
Thank you to my VA staff, who have 
put in the work conducting oversight 
and responding to casework so we can 
understand the needs of veterans in 
Kansas and across the country and 
make meaningful, lasting changes so 
they may experience the American 
dream that they once fought so hard to 
secure for each of us. 
Thank you to Chelsey Ladd, Victoria 
Lee, Scott Nulty, Kevin Ryan, Thomas 
Wilson, Michele Payne, Barry Walker, 
Pauline Schmitt, Thomas Coleman, 
Asher 
Allman, 
Jake 
Vance, 
Mark 
Crowley, 
Brian 
Newbold, 
Lindsay 
Dearing, Emily Blair, Kelsey Baron, 
Tiffanii Woolfolk, and David Shear-
man. 
Finally, I want to recognize my staff 
director, Caroline Canfield, who is end-
ing her service with my office and with 
the Senate at the end of this month. 
She has served as a tremendous asset. 
She is a tremendous asset and a force 
multiplier as my military legislative 
assistant, as my lead appropriations 
staffer, and now as my VA Committee 
staff director. 
Our Nation’s veterans and our mili-
tary members are better off because of 
the work she has done throughout her 
career and because of her tenacious 
‘‘never take no for an answer’’ ap-
proach to doing all things right. 
Caroline, you will be missed, but you 
are always part of the team. You de-
serve our gratitude for what you have 
accomplished on behalf of our Nation’s 
military men and women and on behalf 
of our veterans. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO JAN BARAN 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I want to extend congratulations 
and best wishes to a friend, a skilled 
attorney in the areas of campaign fi-
nance and election law, and a devoted 
defender of the First Amendment. 
After more than 35 years, Jan Witold 
Baran is retiring from the law firm 
Wiley Rein LLP at the end of the 
month. Throughout his distinguished 
career, 
Jan 
has 
successfully 
rep-
resented thousands of clients, includ-
ing me. He has put his brilliance to 
work defending all Americans’ rights 
to participate in our democracy and ex-
press themselves through voluntary 
contributions to the candidates of their 
choice, so that a few elite gatekeepers 
cannot control the public discourse in 
our country. 
When you consider Jan’s background, 
it is no surprise he is committed to 
preserving freedom. Jan was born in 
postwar Europe to a Flemish mother 
and Polish Catholic father. Before Jan 
was born, his father had survived 21⁄2 
years in concentration camps including 
Auschwitz, before he was liberated by 
American troops at Dachau. Jan’s fa-
ther was incarcerated because during 
his tenure as mayor of a small town in 
Poland, he refused to turn in his rifle 
to the Gestapo. Clearly a stubborn 
dedication to freedom under law is in 
Jan’s bloodline. 
Next year will mark the 70th anni-
versary of the Baran family’s immigra-
tion to America. I am sure his parents 
would be extremely proud of what their 
son has accomplished. A decorated 
scholar from Vanderbilt Law School; 
general counsel for the National Re-
publican Congressional Committee; a 
trailblazing attorney at the FEC; gen-
eral counsel to the 1988 campaign of 
President George H. W. Bush; counsel 
to the Republican National Committee. 
President Bush appointed him to the 
Commission on Federal Ethics Law Re-
form and as Ambassador and Chairman 
of the U.S. Delegation to the World Ad-
ministrative Radio Conference. 
Jan Baran has been an integral part 
of legal teams that have defended 
Americans’ political speech rights be-
fore the U.S. Supreme Court. He was 
part of my team when I challenged the 
constitutionality of the campaign fi-
nance law known as McCain-Feingold. 
From McConnell v. FEC to Citizens 
United and beyond, Jan was in the mid-
dle of these important battles. Through 
these episodes and many more, I per-
sonally have witnessed and appreciated 
Jan’s candor, sharp legal mind, and 
strategic thinking. 
Washington can be a transient place, 
but Mr. Baran has stayed in the fray 
for more than 40 years and given his 
best every day to uphold free speech 
and defend the Republic. I am not sure 
if the people of that small town in Po-
land know that the son of their war-
time mayor’s son built such a distin-
guished career in just one generation. 
His talent, perseverance, and commit-
ment to his country are a credit to 
where Jan came from and the life he 
has led along the way. I extend my 
warm wishes to him and his wife Kath-
ryn, their four children, sons-in-law, 
and grandchildren. 
f 
MOZAMBIQUE 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to call attention to the rapidly 
burgeoning 
Islamist 
insurgency 
in 
northern Mozambique, which is drag-
ging that country into ever-increasing 
violence and chaos. In the past decade, 
Mozambique has taken steps to resolve 
a decades-long civil war and while 
peace 
remains 
elusive, 
with 
long-
standing 
support 
from 
the 
United 
States, there has been progress. This 
progress, when coupled with the 2010 
discovery of enormous natural gas re-
serves in the remote northern province 
of Cabo Delgado, could have changed 
the development course of the country. 
But a new conflict has emerged in Mo-
zambique that threatens all of the po-
tential gains for the citizens of the 
province and the entire country. 
The origins of this extremist insur-
gency share traits with many others 
globally: a marginalized community’s 
grievance against corrupt and distant 
rulers, fueled and brutally exploited by 
radical Islamist ideologues, has al-
lowed extremism to take root and gain 
traction, while the innocent majority 
of the local population bears the cost. 
The extremists have proclaimed alle-
giance to ISIS and have rapidly devel-
oped increasingly sophisticated mili-
tary capabilities; Mozambique’s poorly 
trained security forces have proven un-
able to vanquish the group. It is an in-
surgency on the advance. It has seized 
seizing entire towns and now controls 
considerable territory. 
The insurgents, who have attracted 
foreign fighters and recently launched 
attacks into neighboring Tanzania, 
have used horrific acts of terror—in-
cluding systematic use of arson, mur-
der, often including beheadings, and 
kidnapping—to force compliance with 
their aims. Their acts have effectively 
displaced more than 500,000 people in 
Cabo Delgado, creating a severe hu-
manitarian crises. In 1 week in Novem-
ber alone, more than 10,000 people fled 
to the port city of Pemba, many in 
rickety, unsafe boats. A significant of 
these internally displaced persons now 
languish in crowded, unsanitary condi-
tions. 
What can be done to solve this crisis? 
And what should be the role of the 
United States, which today appears to 
be retreating from Africa? This year 
has perhaps taught us more than any 
in recent memory that stability and se-
curity around the world can directly 
impact the stability and security of the 
United States. We have a sustained in-
terest in helping to support innocent, 
suffering people and promoting sta-
bility. 
The security aspect of the threat re-
quires a security solution. However, 
the Mozambican security forces have 
demonstrated that they cannot effec-
tively respond to this threat without 
assistance. It is clear that they lack 
proper training and equipment, and a 
substantial body of reporting has es-
tablished that elements of these forces 
have 
frequently 
committed 
serious 
human rights abuses, as well as en-
gaged in petty corruption targeting the 
local impoverished population. The 
Mozambican Government must take 
steps to ensure that state security 
forces are not only effective, but that 
they also engage in such a manner that 
earns the trust of the population they 
are charged with protecting 
The good news is that the inter-
national community has begun to re-
spond. The U.S.’s counterterrorism co-
ordinator recently visited Maputo to 
offer our assistance to the government. 
European countries have also pledged 
to assist with building Mozambique’s 
security capacities. Any such counter-
terrorism support must include rig-
orous human rights training, as well as 
improvements in civil-military rela-
tions and effective intelligence-gath-
ering. The government should also be 
pressed to reduce its reliance on local 
militias, who have even less training 
and accountability than government 
troops. 
The humanitarian crisis also de-
mands immediate action. Of the half 
million people who have been dis-
placed, 41 percent are children. The 
provinces of northern Mozambique that 
host most of these newly displaced peo-
ple are among the poorest in one of the 
world’s least-developed countries and 
have little capacity to assist those af-
fected by the crisis. In total, more than 
1.3 million people in northern Mozam-
bique are in urgent need of humani-
tarian assistance and protection, ac-
cording to the U.N. The international 
community must step up and fully fund

the modest request of the U.N. Office 
for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs, which has said that it requires 
$254 million to provide humanitarian 
assistance through 2021. 
Counterterrorism training and hu-
manitarian assistance alone, however, 
are not enough to defeat ISIS in Mo-
zambique. They are only tools to re-
spond to the immediate crisis. To effec-
tively address the root causes of the 
conflict—the social and economic in-
equalities that have allowed extremism 
to 
take 
hold 
and 
flourish—the 
Mozambican Government and inter-
national partners must assist in reach-
ing the country’s increasingly-alien-
ated northern communities. The gov-
ernment must engage with its northern 
citizens and deliver what the majority 
of the population wants and expects: 
better governance and critical social 
services. The international community 
can help by collaborating and coordi-
nating their engagement with the gov-
ernment on a package of development 
aid that helps to address poor govern-
ance, increases transparency and fights 
corruption, effectively delivers health 
and education services, and fosters job 
opportunities and local entrepreneur-
ship. Mozambique and its international 
partners also must scale up programs 
aimed at countering extremist ide-
ology and promoting defections from 
the insurgency. 
Donors must also hold the govern-
ment’s feet to the fire on its obligation 
to invest it its own citizenry, including 
by insisting that the government de-
velop its natural resources—notably 
the gas reserves in Cabo Delgado—in an 
equitable, transparent, manner that re-
sults in that a significant portion of 
prospective natural gas revenues being 
invested in the provinces that host Mo-
zambique’s gas resources. 
As the conflict grows in scope and in-
tensity, the United States will need to 
further develop a coordinated, inter-
agency strategy, one which uses all the 
levers of American power—diplomatic, 
development, and defense—to address 
Cabo 
Delgado’s 
military, 
humani-
tarian, and development crisis and to 
work with regional partners on to both 
inform and implement such a strategy. 
The situation in Mozambique is dire, 
and unfortunately it has not attracted 
an appropriate level of attention from 
policymakers. It is tragic to see a 
country that seemed to be on the cusp 
of transformation dragged back into 
conflict. The situation is not hopeless. 
The United States and its partners can 
together effectively help Mozambique 
defeat this insurgency and support the 
Mozambican people’s aspirations for a 
more hopeful future, but the situation 
is urgent. We must act now.

HONORING COMMAND SERGEANT 
MAJOR BENNIE G. ADKINS (RET.) 
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, it is with 
sadness and humility that I ask this 
body to pause for a moment to remem-
ber and honor a great American and a 
citizen of my home State, CSM Bennie 
G. Adkins, who died of complications 
related to the COVID–19 virus on April 
17, 2020. He was laid to rest with full 
military honors this morning after a 
funeral service in the chapel at Arling-
ton National Cemetery. 
Command Sergeant Major Adkins, 
known 
to 
friends 
and 
family 
as 
‘‘Bennie,’’ received the Medal of Honor 
at a White House ceremony on Sep-
tember 15, 2014, for acts of heroism dur-
ing the Vietnam war. Although Bennie 
was recommended for the Medal of 
Honor at the time, he was instead 
given the next highest award, the Dis-
tinguished Service Cross. In 2002, the 
Army began reviewing Distinguished 
Service Cross awards for possible up-
grades, and finally, 48 years later, 
President Obama bestowed a well-de-
served Medal of Honor upon Bennie 
Adkins. 
As we know, the Medal of Honor is 
the Nation’s highest medal for valor in 
combat. According to a statute passed 
in 1918, the President is authorized to 
present this award to ‘‘each person 
who, while an officer or enlisted man of 
the Army, shall hereafter, in action in-
volving actual conflict with an enemy, 
distinguish himself conspicuously by 
gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of 
his life above and beyond the call of 
duty.’’ Other legislation authorizes the 
award within the other military de-
partments as well. 
In the history of this country, the 
Medal of Honor has been awarded to 
3,507 individuals. Fewer than 70 of 
those recipients are still alive today. 
I point this out because I believe that 
when these heroes leave Active Duty 
and come home to live among us in our 
communities, their very presence in 
our midst lifts us all up. They inspire 
and embolden countless other acts of 
courage and sacrifice, both great and 
small, many of which we have seen in 
the recent weeks and months our Na-
tion and our world have been battling 
the 
very 
virus 
that 
took 
Bennie 
Adkins’ life. 
So it is with gratitude and a deep 
sense of loss that we remember this ex-
traordinary man. 
The facts of the events that led to 
Bennie Adkins’ recognition bear men-
tion. However, as President Obama said 
when 
presenting 
Bennie 
with 
the 
Medal, ‘‘I have to be honest, in a battle 
and daring escape that lasted four 
days, Bennie performed so many acts of 
bravery we actually don’t have time to 
talk about all of them.’’ I will, there-
fore, attempt to summarize, combining 
information from the citation that ac-
companied the award, media accounts 
of the events, and quotes from Bennie’s 
memoir. 
When Camp A Shau was attacked by 
a large Viet Cong force early on March 
9, 
1966, 
then-Sergeant 
First 
Class 
Adkins rushed through intense hostile 
fire to man a mortar position. Al-
though wounded himself by incoming 
fire, Bennie briefly relinquished his 
mortar to a comrade and ran through 
exploding mortar rounds in order to 
drag several wounded Americans to 
safety. During the battle, Bennie later 
recalled, bullets hit and killed one man 
he was carrying on his back. At an-
other point, Adkins, a former baseball 
catcher, caught a North Vietnamese 
hand grenade in midair and flung it 
back at the enemy. 
Over the course of 4 days, Bennie re-
peatedly exposed himself to hostile fire 
while rescuing and helping evacuate 
his fellow soldiers, retrieving addi-
tional munitions, and repelling re-
peated waves of attacking enemy sol-
diers. Bennie suffered 18 wounds—in-
cluding to an eye and his torso—but 
managed to kill an estimated 135 to 175 
enemy troops. 
Because of his efforts to carry a 
wounded soldier to an extraction point 
rather than leave him behind, Bennie 
and his group were unable to reach the 
last evacuation helicopter. Running ex-
tremely low on ammunition, he re-
turned to the mortar pit, gathered ad-
ditional ammunition, and ran through 
intense fire back to the communica-
tions bunker. After being ordered to 
evacuate the camp, Adkins and the re-
maining small group destroyed all sig-
nal equipment and classified docu-
ments, then fought their way out of the 
camp and into the jungle, where they 
evaded the pursuing North Vietnamese 
Army for 2 days. 
Their escape was aided by the sawed- 
off shotgun Bennie carried as a sidearm 
and by the unexpected intervention of 
an Indonesian tiger. Trapped in the 
jungle, the group’s radio damaged in 
the battle, Adkins managed to rig his 
shotgun as an antenna, enabling him to 
communicate their location to friendly 
forces. As the group endured a second 
night in the jungle waiting for help to 
arrive, the tiger, which had been hunt-
ing nearby, frightened off the enemy, 
giving Adkins and the others an oppor-
tunity to create a makeshift landing 
pad for a rescue helicopter the next 
morning. 
The Medal of Honor citation con-
cludes, ‘‘Sergeant First Class Adkins’ 
extraordinary heroism in close combat 
against a numerically superior hostile 
force was in keeping with the highest 
traditions of the military service and 
reflects great credit upon himself, his 
unit, and the United States Army.’’ 
Extraordinary indeed. 
Remarkable as those details are, the 
facts of Bennie’s postservice life are 
equally worthy of note. 
Bennie and his wife Mary were mar-
ried for more than 60 years—until she 
passed away in 2019. They don’t give 
medals for that, but I know from ob-
serving my own parents’ 60-plus years 
together that, no matter who the cou-
ple are, that kind of dedication, loy-
alty, and commitment are special. 
After 20 years of service in the Army, 
Bennie retired and went back to 
school. He earned three degrees from 
Troy University—a bachelor’s in fi-
nance and two master’s degrees—and 
opened his own accounting firm in Au-
burn. Then, Bennie began deploying his

charisma, his wit, his way with people, 
and his resources to help others pursue 
their goals through education. 
For several years, Bennie taught 
night classes at Alabama’s Southern 
Union Junior College and Auburn Uni-
versity, as well as GED classes at the 
local jail. Later, he established The 
Bennie Adkins Foundation, which to 
date has provided about 50 educational 
scholarships to noncommissioned Spe-
cial Forces officers. 
Bennie’s dedication to the service of 
his country and to his fellow Ameri-
cans never waned. For many years he 
traveled extensively, in what he de-
scribed as his fourth career, ‘‘trying to 
instill patriotism in our young people.’’ 
And according to President Obama in 
2014, ‘‘the first thing you need to know 
is when Bennie and I met in the Oval 
Office, he asked if he could sign back 
up. His lovely wife was not amused.’’ 
I know that for Bennie’s family and 
his community, this is a loss impos-
sible to describe or to measure. My 
wife Louise joins me in sending our sin-
cerest condolences to Bennie’s daugh-
ter Mary Ann Adkins Blake (David), to 
his sons Michael Adkins (Christine), 
and Keith Adkins (Jaime), and to his 
many grandchildren and great-grand-
children. 
To paraphrase his Medal of Honor ci-
tation, Bennie Adkins’ extraordinary 
life reflects great credit upon himself, 
his family, and his country. May he 
rest in peace, and may God bless the 
United States of America.

REMEMBERING 
GENERAL 
CHARLES 
ELWOOD 
‘‘CHUCK’’ 
YEAGER 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor an American hero and 
one of West Virginia’s native sons who 
was larger than life and an inspiration 
for generations of Americans—General 
Charles 
Elwood 
‘‘Chuck’’ 
Yeager. 
Chuck bravely served our Nation as a 
pilot for more than 30 years in the U.S. 
Air Force during World War II and 
Vietnam. When he became the first 
pilot to break the sound barrier he 
challenged each of us to test the limits 
of what is possible. I am grateful to 
have known this legendary West Vir-
ginian and to call him my dear friend. 
Chuck truly embodied what it means 
to be from the Mountain State. Born in 
1923 in rural Lincoln County, Chuck 
grew up the way many of us do in West 
Virginia—hunting 
and 
fishing 
and 
learning early to be respectful of na-
ture and our fellow man. Like his fa-
ther, A. Hal Yeager, who was a gaswell 
driller, Chuck showed an aptitude for 
mechanics, and by the time he was a 
teenager, he was able to assemble a car 
engine on his own. His work ethic and 
natural talent would serve him well 
throughout the rest of his remarkable 
life. 
In 1941, Chuck enlisted in the Army 
Air Forces right out of high school and 
trained as a mechanic before heading 
to flight school. In 1944, he experienced 
a harrowing encounter when his plane 
was shot down over German-occupied 
France. He and another American trav-
elled on foot through mountainous ter-
rain and snow toward neutral Spain. As 
they stopped to rest, the Nazis opened 
fire, wounding the man traveling with 
Chuck. Chuck carried him into Spain, 
where they met British forces. Despite 
the treacherous journey he had just en-
dured, 
to 
everyone’s 
astonishment, 
Chuck was determined to fly again. He 
climbed his way through the ranks, 
pursuing a return to combat duty, 
which was eventually granted. For his 
service, Chuck received the Silver 
Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, 
the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple 
Heart, and the Air Medal. He also re-
ceived the Presidential Medal of Free-
dom, the Nation’s highest civilian 
award, from President Ronald Reagan 
in 1985. There are so few Veterans left 
from the World War II era, and it is our 
responsibility and our privilege to rec-
ognize the service of these noble he-
roes. 
In 1957, Chuck became an air squad-
ron commander and then commander 
of the Aerospace Research Pilot School 
at Edwards in 1961. He also commanded 
a fighter wing and flew combat mis-
sions during the Vietnam war. He re-
tired as an Air Force brigadier general 
in 1975, and in an honorary gesture, he 
was promoted to the rank of major 
general in 2005. 
We all of course know the story of 
the day Chuck became the first pilot to 
break the sound barrier. On October 14, 
1947, Chuck flew an orange Bell X–1 air-
craft at nearly 700 mph and made his-
tory. Flying F–15 planes, he broke the 
sound barrier again on the 50th and 
55th anniversaries of his pioneering 
flight, and he was a passenger on an F– 
15 plane in another breaking of the 
sound barrier to commemorate the 65th 
anniversary. 
I knew Chuck very well and he was a 
dear friend to me and Gayle. As Gov-
ernor, I was fortunate to host Chuck at 
least once a year for the One Shot Deer 
Hunt, which gives proceeds to helping 
the hungry. He told me so many in-
credible stories of his service, includ-
ing all the intricate details of his leg-
endary flight. I recall him telling me 
that the only reason he got to fly the 
Bell X–1 that day was because the pre-
vious pilot they asked wanted too 
much money. They offered Chuck an 
extra 60 dollars a month, and he 
jumped at the chance. Not only is the 
story 
true 
about 
Chuck 
pushing 
through with a broken rib, but he 
wasn’t even supposed to break the 
sound barrier that day. He thought if 
he didn’t go for it that first day, he 
wouldn’t get another chance. Chuck 
truly had nerves of steel. 
Long after his record-breaking flight, 
Chuck remained in our hearts as a 
symbol of patriotism and bravery. His 
life is full of tales of his bravery, his 
stoicism in the face of danger, and his 
determination to perform his duty no 
matter the cost. 
The legacy Chuck leaves is such an 
important part of our heritage as West 
Virginians. Our little State has mined 
the coal that forged the steel that built 
the tanks and ships that keep our 
country the strongest in the world. It 
is an honor to remember Chuck as part 
of our military service heritage and 
our way of life that sinks deep into the 
roots of West Virginia’s rich culture. I 
encourage all Americans to learn what 
they can about this legendary West 
Virginian. 
Gayle and I are praying for Chuck’s 
wife Victoria, daughters, Susan and 
Sharon, son, Don, and all who loved 
and admired him.

RECOGNIZING OREGON’S FIRST 
FEMALE EAGLE SCOUTS 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to be able to recognize Oregon’s 
first female Eagle Scouts, the highest 
rank attainable in the Boy Scouts of 
America, or BSA. Evelyn Becker, Juli-
ana Cimral, and Anya Kramer have 
demonstrated remarkable leadership, 
skill, and perseverance to earn this im-
portant distinction and have done it 
through an unprecedented pandemic. 
For more than 100 years, the Eagle 
Scout rank has represented a tremen-
dous accomplishment that is recog-
nized in Oregon and across the country. 
To earn Scouting’s highest honor, a 
Scout must demonstrate mastery of 
numerous skills and obtain a merit 
badge for each one, earn a position of 
responsibility within their troop, and 
complete a service project that will di-
rectly benefit their community. Until 
recently, girls and young women were 
not allowed to join BSA, but that fi-
nally changed for the better in Feb-
ruary of 2019. Evelyn, Juliana, and 
Anya, Oregon’s first three female Eagle 
Scouts, received their rank in October 
and will join others in receiving their 
official Eagle title in February 2021. 
We can see examples of their skills 
and dedication to improving their com-
munity in the Eagle service projects 
they tackled. Juliana, a senior at Jes-
uit High School, employed her knowl-
edge of and interest in bees and the im-
portance these pollinators play in the 
food supply chain to build 25 bee houses 
that have increased the pollination and 
production of nearby gardens. Evelyn, 
a sophomore at Scappoose High School, 
built a fence to separate her local 
school from a busy highway and a 
bioswale to prevent children from fall-
ing into the water and to help improve 
the safety of her community. Anya, a 
freshman at Western Oregon Univer-
sity, spent months building a partner-
ship between the West Linn Food Pan-
try and Period.org so that women in 
need would have access to feminine hy-
giene products, an often overlooked es-
sential. 
It has been exciting to see the BSA 
finally welcoming the other half of the 
population into their ranks. Each of 
these 
three 
women 
watched 
their 
brothers succeed in Boy Scouts while

growing up. When finally given the 
chance, they continued that family 
tradition of achievement. I am excited 
to see what new heights these out-
standing Eagle Scouts and community 
leaders will reach. Many more will 
come after them, and our communities 
will be better for it. 
Oregonians always take pride in serv-
ing our State and this great country, 
and these three Eagle Scouts are a 
great example of that. Today I say con-
gratulations to the first women from 
Oregon to earn the rank of Eagle 
Scout, and I wish them many more 
years of success.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO CARMINE CANN, SR. 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, it is a 
great privilege of mine to rise and 
honor a pillar of strength in my home 
State of West Virginia, Carmine Cann, 
Sr., as we celebrate his 90th birthday 
on July 27, 2020. 
Carmine has been like family to me 
for much of my life, and if there is any-
thing to know about Carmine, it is 
that family is everything. It is one of 
the countless things I have always ad-
mired most about him, in addition to 
his unwavering devotion to our home 
State and his unparalleled knowledge 
of business and the law. Throughout 
my own life and career, I have always 
kept Carmine in the back of my mind— 
remembering to stay strong for my 
State and my family. 
A native of Clarksburg, Carmine 
practiced law with his father upon 
graduating from West Virginia Univer-
sity College of Law. In 1954, their firm 
merged 
with 
another 
and 
became 
Young, Morgan and Cann, where he 
practiced 
until 
joining 
Flaherty’s 
Clarksburg office in 2017. 
Carmine served in the West Virginia 
Legislature for 8 years as a member of 
the House of Delegates. Throughout 
government circles, he was widely 
known for his keen political awareness. 
The Charleston Gazette dubbed him 
‘‘Mighty Mouse’’ for his accomplish-
ments in and behind the scenes. After 
choosing not to run for reelection, Car-
mine served the West Virginia Coal As-
sociation 
and 
West 
Virginia 
Beer 
Wholesalers Association as a govern-
mental relations consultant for over 25 
years. 
Some of his awards and honors in-
clude St. Mary’s Irish Legend in 2011, 
Italian American Man of the Year by 
the West Virginia Italian Heritage Fes-
tival in 2005, and recipient of the Dis-
tinguished West Virginian Award in 
1995. 
Among his many roles in the commu-
nity, Carmine is also well known as a 
founding member of the Italian Herit-
age Festival’s Board of Directors. The 
Italian Heritage Festival is such a spe-
cial event for me and for people not 
only in West Virginia but for people 
from across the country. The Italian 
immigrants who came to this country 
didn’t know where they were going, 
couldn’t speak the language, and were 
unfamiliar with Appalachian culture. 
All they knew is that they had to work 
hard and were determined to provide a 
good life for their families. That is 
what the Festival represents, and those 
are the ideals that Carmine upheld. His 
lovely wife Florence, their 7 children, 
25 
grandchildren, 
24 
great-grand-
children, and their entire family, 73 
people altogether, have all been active 
in this beloved festival. After Flor-
ence’s passing, Carmine endowed the 
Florence Chico Cann Children’s Cre-
ative Arts Program as well as the Chil-
dren’s Chorus. Carmine is committed 
to the beautiful North Central region 
of our State, and I know I join count-
less West Virginians in thanking him 
for his service to his community for so 
many years. 
Carmine will tell you that much of 
his success is rooted in faith, and he is 
forever thankful for the blessings that 
his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, has 
provided. He is never one to accept ac-
claim very well, instead deferring all 
praise and thanks to the Almighty. He 
is a shining beacon of his faith, family, 
community, and State. 
Carmine’s expertise has been sought- 
after by Senators, Congressmen, Gov-
ernors, budding community leaders, 
and his friends and family. He has 
never been one to shy away from a 
friendly debate with those who have 
opposing views. Carmine has the great-
est respect for all opinions—people 
from all walks of life. He is first and 
foremost an outstanding person, a gen-
tleman in the old sense, and a true 
broker of compromise in a world so in 
need of that leadership and trust. 
Carmine, despite that we aren’t able 
to have a birthday party in your honor 
this year, I know this will still be a 
memorable occasion for you to reflect 
on your many accomplishments and ex-
periences, while you enjoy the well 
wishes from your loved ones. You have 
provided so much happiness and wis-
dom to the lives of those around you, 
myself included. It is my wish that the 
memory of this special day remains 
with you just as your guidance and in-
fluence will remain in all the lives you 
have touched. I know that Florence, a 
true angel, is smiling down on you. 
Gayle and I are thinking fondly about 
you on this special day, and we sin-
cerely appreciate your many years of 
loyal friendship.∑

TRIBUTE TO COMMAND SERGEANT 
MAJOR PHILIP R. CANTRELL 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, it is 
an honor to rise today to recognize the 
unwavering service of a true West Vir-
ginian, CSM Phillip R. Cantrell, as he 
retires from Active military service 
and transitions to a new chapter of 
public service. Phillip Cantrell is sim-
ply the best of the best. He is humble, 
competent, compassionate, and a war-
rior scholar. He has served in the 
toughest of environments, leading gen-
erations of men and women while hav-
ing an immeasurable and positive in-
fluence on them. I know this because I 
was fortunate to have Phillip on my 
staff for a year as a congressional fel-
low and am fortunate to call him my 
friend. 
Command Sergeant Major Cantrell is 
retiring from his final assignment, 
where he served as the senior enlisted 
leader of the West Virginia National 
Guard, a duty that he assumed in 2018 
where he advised the Adjutant General 
on all matters pertaining to the nearly 
6,400 enlisted soldiers and airmen of the 
West Virginia National Guard. Before 
this assignment with the West Virginia 
National Guard, Phillip served in the 
toughest and most elite Active Army 
units, in combat and in peace. Phillip 
is the Soldier’s Soldier, having trained 
a generation of leaders as a drill ser-
geant, led infantry units in combat as 
a first sergeant and command sergeant 
major, and paid reverence to our Na-
tion’s veterans as the command ser-
geant major of the Old Guard. 
Growing up in Logan County, Phillip 
enlisted in the Active Army Infantry in 
May of 1988 as soon as he graduated 
high school. He attending infantryman 
training at Fort Benning, GA, and 
would add many qualifications along 
the 
way, 
including 
Master 
Jumpmaster, Air Assault, Combat In-
fantry, and Drill Sergeant Badges. He 
married his wife Sherry in June 1989, 
and they have been together through 
numerous deployments, traveling the 
world together to serve their country 
and State. 
Anyone who has served in the mili-
tary knows that the noncommissioned 
officer is the backbone of the Army. 
Throughout his career, Phillip has 
done the heavy lifting and served at 
every level of noncommissioned officer 
leadership, to include team and squad 
leaders, platoon sergeant, first ser-
geant, operations sergeant major and 
battalion and brigade command ser-
geant major. 
Command Sergeant Major Cantrell 
served in the 82nd Airborne Division 
from 1988 to 1996, participating in Oper-
ation Just Cause and Operations Desert 
Shield/Desert Storm before being reas-
signed to Fort Leonard Wood to serve 
as a drill sergeant. Upon his comple-
tion of drill sergeant duty, he returned 
to the 82nd Airborne Division and Fort 
Bragg, where he was deployed on a 
peacekeeping mission to Kosovo with 
the 3/504th Infantry Regiment. 
In 2005, while first sergeant of D 
Company, 2/505th Infantry Regiment, 
82nd Airborne Division, Command Ser-
geant Major Cantrell was deployed in 
support of Hurricane Katrina relief ef-
forts and subsequently deployed two 
companies to Iraq in 2006 in support of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was de-
ployed to Iraq in one of the most dan-
gerous locations during 2006–2007, the 
time period known as the surge, when 
troop deployments were unexpectedly 
extended from 12 months to 15 months.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7538 
December 16, 2020 
My State director served on the ground 
with him in Iraq during this time and 
attests to his solid leadership, having 
seen him operate during the most chal-
lenging, life-and-death conditions. She 
called him ‘‘the best in a unit of the 
bests,’’ which is a testament to his 
leadership in the most difficult of con-
ditions. 
After his combat deployments to 
Iraq, he was promoted to sergeant 
major in 2008 and after completion of 
the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Acad-
emy was assigned as the 8th Army Op-
erations 
and 
Protection 
Sergeant 
Major in Yongsan, Korea. 
Command Sergeant Major Cantrell 
was then competitively selected to 
serve as the battalion command ser-
geant major of 4th Battalion, 3rd Infan-
try Regiment at Fort Myer and in 2012 
was hand-selected as the brigade com-
mand sergeant major of the 3rd Infan-
try Regiment, ‘‘The Old Guard.’’ This 
hallowed unit is America’s oldest Ac-
tive Duty infantry unit where only the 
best are selected to serve. The Old 
Guard is the official ceremonial unit of 
the Army, providing a guard at the 
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and per-
forming countless commemorations at 
Arlington National Cemetery, amongst 
other missions. Phillip’s service at The 
Old Guard is of the highest caliber and 
reflects great credit upon his patriot-
ism and abilities. 
After serving as the most senior en-
listed member of The Old Guard, Phil-
lip was again competitively selected as 
an 
Army 
congressional 
fellow, 
an 
honor awarded to very few highly com-
petitive servicemembers. That is where 
I really got the chance to know Phillip 
and see him in action when he served 
as a member of my staff for a year. 
I have come to know Command Ser-
geant Major Cantrell well throughout 
the years as a valuable part of my 
team as an Army congressional fellow 
and can attest to his strength of char-
acter and profound leadership. It is a 
privilege to recognize him for his serv-
ice to our State and Nation. 
Following the year in my office, he 
was a congressional legislative liaison 
in the Army Senate Liaison Division, 
traveling around the world with con-
gressional delegations. 
Command Sergeant Major Cantrell 
holds a master’s degree in legislative 
affairs from George Washington Uni-
versity and a bachelor’s in human re-
source management from American 
Military University. 
Because of Phillip’s career and his 
unique leadership talents, it is my 
greatest honor to recognize his service. 
When visitors come to West Virginia, I 
jump at the chance to tell them we 
have fought in more wars, shed more 
blood, and lost more lives for the cause 
of freedom than most any State. We 
have always done the heavy lifting and 
never complained. We have mined the 
coal and forged the steel that built the 
guns, ships, and factories that have 
protected and continue to protect our 
country to this day. 
I am so deeply proud of what West 
Virginians have accomplished and what 
they will continue to accomplish to 
protect the freedoms we hold dear. 
Command Sergeant Major Cantrell is a 
part of this legacy of excellence and an 
inspiration to all who will follow in his 
footsteps. I want to wish Phillip, his 
wife Sherry who has been with him 
every step of the way, along with his 
family and many friends, a heartfelt 
congratulations and warm wishes for 
future health and happiness.∑

REMEMBERING MARK ALLEN 
GOUZD 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President I rise 
today to honor the life of a proud West 
Virginian and a devoted husband, fa-
ther, and grandfather, my cousin, Mark 
Allen Gouzd. 
Put simply, Mark embodied what it 
means to be a West Virginian, and the 
legacy he has left is such an important 
part of our heritage. There is no great-
er accomplishment than being in a po-
sition to give back to your community, 
and his work in mine safety and rescue 
truly benefited our home State in a 
profound way that undoubtedly saved 
countless lives. 
After graduating from Mannington 
High School and later Fairmont State 
College, Mark began his career in land 
surveying and eventually began work-
ing with Federal Number 2 Mines. As 
an instructor for the Mine Rescue Pro-
gram, Mark diligently prepared miners 
for the rigors of working underground. 
The teams he trained always went on 
to perform well in local, State, and 
even national competitions. For the 
last few years, Mark worked as an ex-
tension agent for West Virginia Univer-
sity as the manager of mine rescue and 
emergency response training at WVU’s 
Doll’s Run facility. He also served as 
the WVU Collegiate Mine Rescue Team 
trainer. 
Having experienced a coal mining 
tragedy within our own family, Mark’s 
work was especially admirable and 
came from a place of caring deeply for 
the people who keep our lights on, as 
well as their families. West Virginia 
suffered an immeasurable loss when 78 
brave coal miners were killed in the 
Farmington No. 9 mine disaster 52 
years ago. My dear uncle John Gouzd, 
one of my neighbors, and several high 
school classmates were in the mine 
that day. For days, we all sat around 
the company store waiting for updates 
about the fate of our loved ones. I will 
never forget the look on my mother’s 
face when she heard the news that her 
younger brother had died in the explo-
sion. Our community and the entire 
State came together to mourn the lives 
we lost. For Mark and me, that dis-
aster fueled our passion for promoting 
changes that would help keep our min-
ers safe and also ensure their families 
were taken care of. 
I always consider myself fortunate to 
have grown up around such strong, in-
spiring people. Marion County and our 
home State as a whole is just special 
that way. I always respected and ad-
mired Mark for the strong, passionate 
leader he was. As a lifelong member of 
St. 
Patrick’s 
Catholic 
Church 
in 
Mannington, Mark served as a lector, 
Eucharistic minister, and choir mem-
ber. The importance of faith and family 
was at the forefront of everything he 
set out to do, and it carried him 
through any hardships he faced. 
He loved to work with his hands and 
found solace in gardening and working 
on his farm, and I know I join our en-
tire family in remembering Mark as 
the hard-working, generous soul he 
was. His legacy lives on through our 
many loving memories of him as well 
as through the brave coal miners who 
learned from his lifesaving training. 
What is most important is that he 
lived a full life, surrounded by his loved 
ones. Gayle and I extend our condo-
lences to his beloved wife of nearly 36 
years, Lora; their sons, Zachary and 
his wife Kelly, and Jeremy and his wife 
Allie; and his grandson Oliver; as well 
as his parents Joe and Carole; his sis-
ters, Christina and her husband Jack, 
and Cynthia and her husband Steve; his 
brother-in-law Remy Petrucci; and his 
mother-in-law and father-in-law, Leon-
ard and Judy Myers; in addition to his 
numerous nieces and nephews. Again, 
we extend our most sincere condo-

who had the privilege of knowing him.∑

REMEMBERING CASSIE JOHNSON 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
one 
of 
West 
Virginia’s 
finest. 
Patrolwoman Cassie Johnson of the 
Charleston 
Police 
Department 
rep-
resented the very best of who we are as 
a statewide community, and she was 
taken from us far too soon on Decem-
ber 3, 2020, at the age of 28. Cassie was 
the daughter of an ironworker; she 
shared her mother’s steely resolve and 
iron constitution. 
Being a police officer in the city she 
loved and grew up in was a dream come 
true for Cassie. She was sworn in by 
Mayor Amy Goodwin in January of 2019 
and had previously worked as a city 
humane officer. Cassie was born and 
raised in our State’s capital. She could 
have gone anywhere, and she chose to 
stay and protect and serve the commu-
nity that made her who she was. 
She was truly a beautiful person in 
every way. Growing up, Cassie was an 
athlete and particularly loved softball. 
She would one day find that the Little 
League field she played on as a child 
was on her beat, and so she watched 
over it with great care so the current 
generation of children could play in 
safety. One of the first things she did 
when she was assigned to the field was 
to clean up the drug paraphernalia to 
make it a safe place for kids. Because

December 16, 2020 
of her efforts, children and their fami-
lies have been able to enjoy the field as 
a clean, safe, fun place to play. 
Cassie was an animal lover and dedi-
cated her life to rescuing pets who had 
been cast aside, even taking an animal 
behavior class in Tennessee so she 
could better understand the language 
of dogs. Cassie’s beloved dog, Emma, 
was a chocolate lab who passed away 
just a few months ago. Cassie grieved 
deeply for Emma because she had a 
special connection with her. Years ago, 
when Cassie was in high school, Emma 
had 
nine 
chocolate 
lab 
pups—in 
Cassie’s bedroom. Her mom tells the 
story of taking the runt of the litter 
with her to pick Cassie up at school. 
When they got home, there were choco-
late lab pups everywhere. That was 
just one of the many adventures Cassie 
had with Emma. No doubt, they are re-
united again. 
Cassie was a music lover, most likely 
because her mother sang her to sleep as 
a child. She was surrounded by instru-
ments and music throughout her life. 
She loved to make the world beautiful, 
and that is also why she enjoyed deco-
rating for the holidays. The weekend 
before she passed, she decorated her 
mother’s house for Christmas, along-
side her dear sister, Chelsea. One of the 
last actions she took the day of her 
passing was to wipe the snow from 
those holiday decorations because she 
always looked out for her mother any 
way she could. 
Most importantly, Cassie was a genu-
inely good person and lived her whole 
life with West Virginia values. She 
worked hard and bought her own home 
at the age of 25. She was beloved in the 
community and in her profession, as 
evidenced 
in 
the 
tremendous 
out-
pouring of grief, support, and fellow-
ship that followed her tragic passing. 
Her mother describes her as respectful 
and 
well-mannered 
throughout 
her 
whole life. Cassie will be deeply missed 
not only because of who she was but 
because we are all so keenly aware of 
and sorrowful for what might have 
been. 
No one can ever take away what 
Cassie represented to the Charleston 
community and the entire Mountain 
State. Every one of our female leaders 
in West Virginia is the epitome of 
strength and advancement in their 
fields and serve as inspiring role mod-
els for the next generation, and that is 
due in great part to the women who 
broke ground in generations past. Be-
cause of their accomplishments, more 
young women like Cassie have, and 
will, blaze their own trails and con-
tinue to make our State and entire Na-
tion proud. I have such tremendous re-
spect for our police officers and all of 
our first responders. Cassie’s compas-
sion, courage, and selflessness will live 
on through the memories of those who 
knew and loved her, as well as through 
the countless lives she touched and in-
spired every day. She leaves us having 
made a profound impact in the commu-
nity she loved as well as in the lives of 
those around her. 
I had the tremendous and humbling 
honor of visiting with Cassie’s family 
at her bedside in her final hours. It is 
clear to me that Cassie came from 
strong roots and that her life was filled 
with joy and love. She was a beloved 
daughter, sister, and a loyal friend, 
who adored her three dogs and all ani-
mals. True to her character, Cassie was 
an organ donor, and her final act of 
selflessness has given someone else a 
chance at life. 
The Charleston Police Department 
has retired Cassie’s unit number, 146. I 
know I join the entire Mountain State 
in mourning our shared loss of this 
bright, generous, vibrant spirit. Gayle 
and I extend our deepest condolences to 
Cassie’s mother Sheryl, her sister Chel-
sea, her brother Terry, and all her fam-
ily and friends, her colleagues with the 
Charleston Police Department, as well 
as the city of Charleston, and will for-
ever keep them in our prayers.∑

REMEMBERING DR. RICHARD 
HOWARD 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a proud West Virginian, 
noble veteran, a beloved son, brother, 
uncle, godfather, great-uncle, and a 
dear friend to all who had the pleasure 
of knowing him. It is a privilege to rec-
ognize the life and legacy of a very 
dear friend to myself and Gayle, Dr. 
Richard Howard, for his many years of 
dedicated 
service 
to 
the 
city 
of 
Charleston and beyond. 
Born and raised in Charleston, WV, 
Richard attended West Virginia Uni-
versity, where he achieved many dis-
tinctions as a member of the National 
Blue Key, Helvetia, Sphinx and presi-
dent of the freshman class in 1960. He 
received early acceptance into the 
West Virginia University School of 
Dentistry, earning his doctor of dental 
surgery degree in 1967. Put simply, 
when Richard put his mind to some-
thing, there was no stopping him from 
doing it at 100 percent. 
That mentality worked in his favor 
as he joined the U.S. Air Force as a 
captain, stationed during the Vietnam 
era at Dover Air Force Base. Following 
his honorable discharge, Richard re-
turned to Charleston to start his long- 
tenured career in dentistry. After a 
year as a partner with a local dental 
office, Richard set up his own practice 
as Howard Family Dentistry, later 
known as a joint venture with his 
brother as Howard and Howard Family 
Dentistry. 
There is a lot to be said of someone 
who bravely serves our Nation, then re-
turns home to continue giving back to 
the community that made them who 
they are. When visitors come to West 
Virginia, I jump at the chance to tell 
them we have fought in more wars, 
shed more blood, and lost more lives 
for the cause of freedom than most any 
State. We have always done the heavy 
lifting and never complained. We have 
mined the coal and forged the steel 
that built the guns, ships, and factories 
that have protected and continue to 
protect our country to this day. I am 
so deeply proud of what West Vir-
ginians have accomplished and what 
they will continue to accomplish to 
protect the freedoms we hold dear. 
That is Richard’s legacy, and his cour-
age, loyalty, and humility will never be 
forgotten. 
Richard was deeply involved in the 
community through the Kanawha Val-
ley Dental Association, the West Vir-
ginia Dental Association, the American 
Dental Association, and the Academy 
of General Dentists, the International 
College of Dentists, and was founder 
and twice-serving president of the Vir-
ginia Street Dental Study Club. He was 
a member of the Beni Kedem Shrine, 
the Legion of Honor, Shrine Jesters, a 
32 degree Mason, the Veterans of For-
eign Wars, the Charleston Symphony, 
the Charleston Community Music As-
sociation, and the West Virginia Uni-
versity Woodburn Circle of Honor. 
Richard was a major supporter of his 
church, St. George Orthodox Cathedral, 
of which he was knight in the Order of 
St. Ignatius of Antioch. 
Richard had such a zest for life and 
was a true renaissance man in every 
sense of the word. Each challenge he 
took on, he conquered, and he did so 
with unparalleled generosity, humility, 
and leadership. When his father passed 
away, Richard truly stepped up as the 
family patriarch. He adored his siblings 
and his entire family, always willing to 
offer advice. He would be honest with 
you if you were wrong, but his judge-
ment was always fair. His bright smile 
and vibrant personality made any occa-
sion even more special. His accomplish-
ments are endless and he was an inspi-
ration to all. He is dearly missed. 
Put simply, Richard represented the 
very best of West Virginia, which is 
saying quite a lot. In the Mountain 
State, if you are hungry you will be 
fed. If you are lost, someone will not 
only give you directions but will offer 
to drive you to your destination. That 
is just who we are, and that is who 
Richard was. We have lost a shining 
star in our home State’s capital, but 
his impact on the lives of his patients 
and his passion for this special commu-
nity will last forever. It was an honor 
to have known him and to call him my 
friend. 
What is most important is that Rich-
ard lived a full and accomplished life, 
surrounded by dear friends and family. 
It is my hope that his loved ones are 
able to find peace, strength, and sup-
port in one another. I extend my con-
dolences to his brother Dr. Edward E. 
Howard; sisters Jolene Howard, Janet 
M. Howard, Margaret Howard Teeter 
(Andrew), and Sabrina Howard Stump 
(James); 
nephew, 
Dr. 
Matthew 
D. 
Stump; and nieces Dr. Jacqueline H. 
Stump, Elizabeth Stevens Bloch (Tom), 
and great nephew Thomas M. Bloch III. 
Gayle and I, from our family to yours, 
extend to you our most sincere condo-
lences for our shared loss of this won-
derful person. The unwavering love

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL 
JAMES A. HOYER 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, it is 
an honor to rise today to recognize the 
legacy of MG James A. Hoyer of the 
West Virginia National Guard, a man 
whom I have worked with for decades 
and a man whom I am fortunate to call 
my friend. 
General Hoyer assumed the duties as 
The Adjutant General, West Virginia 
Joint Forces Headquarters-West Vir-
ginia in 2011, providing command guid-
ance and vision to the West Virginia 
Army and Air National Guard of more 
than 6,500 Citizen Soldiers and Airmen. 
Upon obtaining his undergraduate de-
gree from the University of Charleston, 
he was commissioned in 1983 through a 
joint Reserve Officer Training Corps 
program with West Virginia State Uni-
versity. General Hoyer’s military ca-
reer began in the West Virginia Na-
tional Guard as a Cavalry Officer. He 
attended the Special Forces Officer 
Qualification course and spent more 
than 14 years with the 2nd Battalion, 
19th Special Forces Group. General 
Hoyer led the development of the West 
Virginia National Guard Counterdrug 
Task Force and the Joint Interagency 
Training and Education Center and its 
Center for National Response—a na-
tional level operational and training 
capability for critical infrastructure 
protection and consequence response. 
General Hoyer’s most recent assign-
ment was Director, Joint Staff, of the 
West 
Virginia 
Joint 
Force 
Head-
quarters. 
General Hoyer continued his edu-
cation throughout his career, including 
West Virginia Graduate College in 1987, 
United States Army War College in 
2004, and obtained his Federal/Depart-
ment of Defense Identify Management 
Certificate from the Naval Post Grad-
uate School in 2009. 
Among his many awards, decorations 
and achievements, General Hoyer has 
earned the Legion of Merit, Meri-
torious Service Medal (with 1 Bronze 
Oak Leaf Cluster), Army Commenda-
tion Medal (with 1 Bronze Oak Leaf 
Cluster), Army Achievement Medal 
(with 2 Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters), 
Army Reserve Component Achieve-
ment Medal (with 1 Silver Oak Leaf 
Cluster), 
National 
Defense 
Service 
Medal (with 1 Bronze Service Star), 
Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on 
Terrorism 
Service 
Medal, 
Armed 
Forces Reserve Medal (with Silver 
Hourglass and M Device), Army Service 
Ribbon, 
Overseas 
Service 
Ribbon, 
Army Reserve Component Overseas 
Training Ribbon, West Virginia Com-
mendation Medal, West Virginia Emer-
gency Service Ribbon, West Virginia 
State Service Ribbon, West Virginia 
Service 
Ribbon, 
West 
Virginia 
Counterdrug Ribbon, West Virginia 
Distinguished 
Unit 
Award, 
Special 
Forces Tab, Master Parachutist Badge, 
Air Assault Badge, and the Thailand 
Parachute Badge. 
I have seen firsthand how the Guard 
protects the citizens of West Virginia 
when we are in our most desperate 
hour of need and how the Guard pro-
tects our country when called upon to 
serve at the command and control of 
the President of the United States. As 
Governor, my most honored title was 
that of Commander-in-Chief of the 
Guard. I worked closely with Jim 
Hoyer and the Guard and did every-
thing I could to increase capabilities 
for personnel, equipment, and facili-
ties. 
As U.S. Senator, I have the honor of 
serving on the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, as well as the Appropria-
tions Committee, the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee, and as ranking member on 
the Senate Energy Committee. I con-
tinue to work hand-in-hand with Jim 
Hoyer to promote good policy for the 
Guard, the Department of Defense, and 
all of our Nation’s heroes. 
Throughout my time as Governor 
and as Senator, I have relied on the Na-
tional Guard not only to do their mis-
sion but to provide solid advice so that 
I could form the best policies. I have 
truly counted on Jim Hoyer’s sound 
guidance and military expertise every 
step of the way. Whether it was form-
ing the Congressional Veterans Jobs 
Caucus, writing amendments on the 
Defense bill, preventing war in Syria, 
providing death gratuity benefits for 
families of the fallen during a govern-
ment shutdown, or bringing more mili-
tary assets like the C–130J to West Vir-
ginia, Jim Hoyer has been with me 
every step of the way. 
The West Virginia National Guard 
fulfills its mission of ‘‘Delivering Free-
dom with Courage’’ every single day. I 
am so very proud of the Guard for serv-
ing our State and our Nation so coura-
geously in times of need, and I am 
grateful for their unwavering service 
and selfless efforts to protect our 
homeland. This success is due in large 
part to the Guard’s outstanding leader-
ship, and I am grateful to General 
Hoyer for serving as a part of this leg-
acy of excellence. 
When visitors come to West Virginia, 
I jump at the chance to tell them we 
have fought in more wars, shed more 
blood, and lost more lives for the cause 
of freedom than most any State. We 
have always done the heavy lifting and 
never complained. We have mined the 
coal and forged the steel that built the 
guns, ships, and factories that have 
protected and continue to protect our 
country to this day. I am so deeply 
proud of what West Virginians have ac-
complished and what they will con-
tinue to accomplish to protect the free-
doms we hold dear. 
While General Hoyer is retiring and 
everyone is sure to miss his strong 
leadership, his dedication and commit-
ment to excellence will leave a lasting 
legacy with the countless lives he has 
touched. Again, I congratulate General 
Hoyer for his remarkable years of serv-
ice and his outstanding dedication to 
protecting our great Nation. I am hon-
ored to wish good health and much 
happiness to him, his wife Amy, his 
sons Jacob and Drew, and his wonderful 
extended family in the days and years 
ahead.∑

TRIBUTE TO JEREMY WAYNE 
HARRELL 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, today I 
recognize the tremendous dedication of 
Jeremy Wayne Harrell, of Louisville, 
KY, the founder of an all-volunteer or-
ganization called the Veterans Club. 
Already nationally celebrated for its 
Equine Therapy Program and for ef-
forts to create a recovery center for 
homeless veterans, this unique Ken-
tucky nonprofit has made veteran iso-
lation its singular focus during the 
coronavirus pandemic. A veteran him-
self, Mr. Harrell recognizes that social 
isolation created by the pandemic can 
amplify the sense of loneliness already 
experienced by many veterans as they 
transition into civilian life following 
multiple deployments. Mr. Harrell was 
recently honored by Metro Louisville 
government 
with 
its 
Distinguished 
Veteran and Citizen Award and by 
Humana as the winner of its Boots on 
the Ground Campaign Award. I am 
proud to represent veterans like Jer-
emy Harrell in the U.S. Senate and in 
particular to recognize him today for 
his steadfast commitment to our vet-
erans and their families. The great 
work of the Veterans Club is an inspi-
ration to us all to find and connect 
with those in our communities who 
struggle with a sense of isolation.∑

days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register its declaration, the 
President publishes in and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13818 of December 20, 2017, is to 
continue in effect beyond December 20, 
2020. 
The 
prevalence 
and 
severity 
of 
human rights abuse and corruption 
that have their source, in whole or in 
substantial part, outside the United 
States, continue to threaten the sta-
bility of international political and 
economic systems. Human rights abuse 
and corruption undermine the values 
that form an essential foundation of 
stable, secure, and functioning soci-
eties; have devastating impacts on in-
dividuals; weaken democratic institu-
tions; degrade the rule of law; perpet-
uate violent conflicts; facilitate the ac-
tivities of dangerous persons; under-
mine economic markets; and continue 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United 
States. Therefore, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13818 with respect to serious 
human rights abuse and corruption.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. CARDIN: 
S. 5031. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for a 
progressive consumption tax and to re-
form the income tax, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
introduced the Progressive Consump-
tion Tax Act of 2020. 
We need a tax code that is fair for 
American families and for employers. 
We need a tax code that rethinks how 
our Nation collects the revenue that 
allows us to build our roads and bridges 
and keeps our Nation safe. We need a 
system that values our most vulner-
able Americans, small businesses, and 
makes our U.S.-based businesses more 
competitive. 
In our recent history, comprehensive 
tax reform has been out of grasp. Con-
gressional leaders have long called for 
a 1986–style tax reform in which the 
tax code would be streamlined and sim-
plified to broaden the tax base and 
lower income tax rates. The 2017 tax 
law was a representation of how hard 
this type of tax reform is. It kept in 
place much of what makes the tax code 
complicated and inefficient, did not se-
cure permanent income tax rate reduc-
tions for working families, and it in-
creased the deficit by nearly $2 trillion. 
It is time we take a new approach. 
As we look to the future and work to-
wards the goal of a sustainable econ-
omy that works for all, my colleagues 
and I will need to think creatively 
about how to raise revenues and pro-
vide for the services the government 
must and can deliver. 
Austere and regressive spending cuts 
are not the answer to the question of 
how to set the country on a sustainable 
path and support working families. In-
stead, we should look at ways to raise 
reasonable revenues and make the tax 
code work better for all. The Progres-
sive Consumption Tax Act should be 
part of that conversation. 
I introduced versions of this bill in 
the past to provide an opening for dis-
cussion and an opportunity to review 
legislative language for this type of 
comprehensive tax reform. Now more 
than ever it is critical Congress revisit 
the thinking about comprehensive tax 
reform that is lasting and progressive. 
The 2017 tax law was constructed 
with many temporary policies that will 
require future action on tax policies as 
these provisions expire. 
While some of those will be years 
from now, this conversation can never 
start early enough. We know that good 
ideas can take time to become main-
stream. In a world where about 150 
countries now have a consumption tax, 
it is time the U.S. join this main-
stream thinking. 
The legislation I have introduced 
today is an example of truly progres-
sive, fiscally responsible, pro-growth 
tax reform could look like. 
It also provides an opportunity for 
the U.S. to catch up with the rest of 
the world. All OECD countries except 
the U.S. have a consumption tax. 
The Progressive Consumption Tax 
Act would put this country on a level 
playing field by providing for a pro-
gressive consumption tax, or PCT, at a 
rate of 10 percent. The PCT would gen-
erate revenue by taxing goods and serv-
ices, rather than income. 
The revenues collected by the PCT 
would eliminate an income tax liabil-
ity for most households in this Nation. 
Lower income individuals, those cur-
rently eligible for the Earned Income 
Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, 
would receive rebates to cover the cost 
of their PCT burden, cementing the 
progressivity of this new system. 
For those who do still have an in-
come tax liability under this Act would 
have lower rates and a simplified in-
come tax. Under current law, the top 
marginal income tax rate is 37 percent. 
Under the Progressive Consumption 
Tax Act, the top income rate would be 
just 28 percent. 
The 2017 tax law reduced the cor-
porate tax rate to 21 percent. This Act 
would further reduce that rate to 17 
percent. Businesses would be more 
competitive and this would contribute 
to a pro-growth economy in the U.S., 
all while collecting reasonable reve-
nues. 
As we discuss this proposal, you will 
hear me say this over and over again: 
An overarching goal of the Progressive 
Consumption Tax Act is ensuring the 
tax code is progressive, meaning that 
those who make less in income don’t 
have a higher tax burden than wealthy 
people. The provisions included in this 
Act—removing an income tax liability 
for most households and providing re-
bates—are meant to maintain progres-
sivity in the tax code for families. 
For those who worry that a consump-
tion tax will bring in ‘‘too much’’ 
money, my legislation remains bal-
anced. It is designed to raise stable and 
reasonable tax revenues. However, if 
more revenues than envisioned are col-
lected under this legislation, a ‘‘circuit 
breaker’’ would return additional reve-
nues to taxpayers. Again, we put 
money back into the hands of the tax-
payers. 
In 2017, I offered the Progressive Con-
sumption Tax Act as an alternative to 
the tax legislation considered that 
year. While it would have been a re-
sponsible choice to enact then, it could 
still provide a fresh start now. 
Since that law was passed, there has 
been increased interest in looking at 
ways to reform the nation’s tax laws to 
tilt any benefit more towards those 
who were left behind and raise reason-
able revenues. My colleagues in Con-
gress and stakeholders are searching 
for forward-looking ideas for how to 
modernize the tax code. I am excited 
that President-elect Biden has put for-
ward tax reform proposals and Congres-
sional leaders have done the same. The 
longer we wait to put this country in a 
better, more competitive, progressive 
position, the harder it will be. 
That’s why I am reintroducing the 
Progressive 
Consumption 
Tax 
this 
year. As this Congress closes and the 
new Congress convenes, I hope we will 
seriously consider the tax system in 
this country and consider the types of 
reforms proposed in the Progressive 
Consumption Tax Act. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of my bill appear in 
the RECORD following these remarks.

By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. 
BENNET, Mr. BROWN, Mr. CASEY, 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO, Mr. DURBIN, 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR, and Mrs. MUR-
RAY): 
S. 5035. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to provide match-
ing payments for retirement savings 
contributions by certain individuals; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I 
have 
introduced 
the 
Encouraging 
Americans to Save Act (EASA). This 
legislation makes common sense re-
forms to the saver’s tax credit by mak-
ing the credit refundable and restruc-
turing it as a government matching 
contribution that is directly deposited 
into a worker’s retirement savings ac-
count. 
This bill would offer matching con-
tributions for the first time to millions 
of middle and lower income individuals 
not covered by an employer-sponsored 
retirement plan, including those who 
save through an IRA under a State or 
local government savings program- 
such as workers in my home State of 
Oregon under the OregonSaves pro-
gram. The government match is also 
available to middle and lower income 
savers who participate in an employer- 
sponsored plan. 
The government match provided by 
the bill would both encourage saving 
and help middle and low income earn-
ers build assets by providing an imme-
diate, meaningful return on their per-
sonal contributions. The legislation 
would also establish a coronavirus 
bonus recovery credit that would pro-
vide an additional government match 
of up to $5,000 to workers on their re-
tirement saving for a five year period 
beginning in 2022. I urge my colleagues 
to support this legislation. 
By Mr. GRAHAM: 
S. 5036. A bill to amend the Overtime 
Pay for Protective Services Act of 2016

ing the service obligation.

cordance with subparagraph (B), the Sec-
retary shall, upon such reinstatement—

cipient to fulfill the service obligation de-

2020 CONGRESSIONAL ART 
COMPETITION WINNER 
HON. DEBBIE LESKO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Evie Nguyen of Glendale, Ari-
zona on winning the 2020 Congressional Art 
Competition for Arizona’s 8th Congressional 
District. 
Evie’s artwork, completed in charcoal and ti-
tled ‘‘Mutual,’’ highlights the close relationship 
between humans and nature by showcasing 
herself with a Cactus Wren, Arizona’s state 
bird. 
Evie was a senior at Deer Valley High 
School when the artwork was completed. Her 
art is currently being displayed in the U.S. 
Capitol along with the other Congressional Art 
Competition winners from around the country. 
Each spring, I am proud to host the Con-

credibly talented students across Arizona’s 8th

It is an honor to represent these promising 
young artists in Congress.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
FIRE 
CHIEF 
MICHAEL 
W. 
MCLAUGHLIN 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Chief Michael McLaughlin and cele-
brate his retirement from the Cosumnes Fire 
Department. Chief McLaughlin started his fire 
service career in 1988 as a Reserve Fire-
fighter with Contra Costa County Consolidated 
Fire Protection District. Throughout his fire 
service career, he has served for South Lake 
County and Lawrence Livermore before being 
promoted to Assistant Fire Chief. He then be-
came a Division Chief for the Merced Fire De-
partment before serving with Cosumnes CSD 
Fire Department which covers my district. Dur-
ing his time with the CSD Fire Department, he 
has held the title of Deputy Fire Chief before 
his promotion to his current role as Fire Chief. 
Before Chief McLaughlin became a fire-
fighter, he worked as a paramedic in Alameda 
and Contra Costa Counties. He was also in-
strumental in the creation and growth of the 
South Lake County and Lawrence Livermore 
Paramedic Programs and has been a licensed 
Paramedic in California since 1990. Mr. 
McLaughlin has an Associate of Science De-
gree in Fire Technology from Yuba College, 
along with a Bachelor of Science Degree in 
Fire Department Administration from Cogswell 
Polytechnical College. 
I want to extend my congratulations and 
thank Chief McLaughlin for his hard work and 
dedication to keeping California safe. Chief 
McLaughlin also assisted in the development 
of the HERO Act, legislation I introduced to 
provide first responders access to critical men-
tal health resources which passed the House 
of Representatives this fall. I ask my col-
leagues 
to 
join 
me 
in 
celebrating 
Mr. 
McLaughlin for his work in the community and 
wish him the best in retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DAMIEN 
JEROME LOPEZ 
HON. TOM O’HALLERAN 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Damien 
Jerome Lopez, a brave first responder and 
firefighter from Globe, Arizona, who passed 
away last week after his battle with COVID– 
19. 
For over two decades, Damien bravely 
served his community as a first responder and 
firefighter, retiring as a Captain in 2016. 
This year, during the coronavirus pandemic, 
Lopez selflessly answered the call to care for 
his community and began working as a health 
care educator, assisting COVID–19 response 
efforts on the San Carlos Apache reservation. 
A beloved community member, colleague, 
friend, and father, he was known for his dedi-
cation to helping all people. Damien was a 
generous man with a kind heart and a warm 
sense of humor. I know how much he meant 
to the people of Globe. 
My family and I are keeping the Lopez fam-
ily, Damien’s friends and loved ones, and the 
entire Globe and San Carlos Apache commu-
nities in our prayers as we mourn his passing.

TRIBUTE TO FREDDIE PATRICK 
NEFF 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to Freddie ‘‘Fred’’ 
Patrick Neff, who passed away on Saturday, 
October 31, 2020. Fred was a veteran, small 
business owner, a devoted family man, and he 
will be deeply missed. 
Fred was born on March 17, 1936 in Den-
ver, Colorado. After traveling throughout the 
West as a youth, Fred decided to join the Air 
Force. The Air Force took him to many military 
bases in the Far East as well as around the 
United States. While stationed at Clark Air 
Force 
Base 
he 
met 
his 
wife, 
Emerita 
Arrogante. Following a stint at March Air Force 
Base, Fred retired from the military after put-
ting in his 30 years as a decorated veteran. 
Retirement from the military allowed Fred to 
do many things in the second half of his life. 
In his later years, he founded and served as 
president of two construction companies: 
Kadena Pacific and Cal American Construc-
tion Inc. According to his family, Fred loved 
dogs. Over the years, he was a proud dog 
dad to Herman, Nikko, Rambo, Ace, Ivan, 
Jude, Sadie and Rocco. Fred loved to hunt 
and fish, and enjoyed going out to dinner or 
out for a cup of coffee. Before he passed, 
Fred shared with his family that he had ‘‘no re-
grets’’ and truly his life’s testimony reflected a 
full, well lived life. 
In addition to his wife, Emerita, Fred is sur-
vived by his children: Susanna, Beverly, and 
Ray. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the 
Neff family, his friends, and everyone fortunate 
enough to know Fred. Although Fred may be 
gone, the many contributions he made to his 
community and family will have a lasting im-
pact.

HON. MO BROOKS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Mr. Ken Tucker on

An Alabama native and alumnus of the Uni-
versity of Alabama, Ken earned his bachelor’s

guished career serving as Boeing’s Director of

defense 
programs, 
including

few. 
Ken 
fostered 
workforce 
development 
through enhancing STEM education in the 
Southeast. Notably, he helped establish aero-

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER AND 
SERVICE OF DR. TOM TERRY 
HON. PETER WELCH 
OF VERMONT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to offer congratulations to Dr. Thomas F. Terry 
on his retirement after practicing for 45 years 
as an optometrist. All but one of those years 
were spent in White River Junction, Vt., not far 
from his place of birth in Windsor. 
Dr. Tom Terry is a prime example of what 
another Vermonter, President Calvin Coolidge, 
said in Bennington in a speech on Sept. 21, 
1928. During his speech, Coolidge talked 
about the state he loved—Vermont: ‘‘I love 
Vermont because of her hills and valleys, her 
scenery and invigorating climate, but most of 
all because of her indomitable people.’’ 
Coolidge’s description of Vermont and her 
people are as apt today as it was more than 
90 years earlier. While there have been many 
Vermonters who fit this description, but no one 
more than Dr. Tom Terry of Wilder, Vt. 
He was born in the Connecticut Valley. After 
graduation from Windsor High School, Dr. 
Terry graduated from Springfield College with 
majors in chemistry and physics. He then at-
tended New England College of Optometry 
and graduated with a doctorate degree in 
1975. A year later he returned to Vermont and 
set up a practice in White River Junction 
where he continued to serve his many pa-
tients, until his retirement on Dec. 30, 2020. 
During his years of practice, Dr. Terry devel-
oped a major interest in primary and medical 
eye care, including macular degeneration and 
glaucoma care. Dr. Terry was also trained a 
as low vision specialist and worked, as such, 
with the Vermont Division of the Blind. 
Dr. Terry became well-known for his skills, 
not only in Vermont, but throughout New Eng-
land and in national optometric councils. He 
served for six years as President of the 
Vermont Optometric Association, as well as 17 
years on the Board of Optometry for the state. 
For 27 years, Dr. Terry did service on various 
American Optometric Association committees 
as well as nine years as Acting Eye Clinic 
Chief at the Veterans Administration Hospital 
in White River Junction. Dr. Terry’ s deep in-
terest in health care matters also led him to 
serve for 10 years on the Board of the Alice 
Peck Day Memorial Hospital in nearby Leb-
anon, N.H. 
As much as Dr. Terry enjoyed serving his 
many patients in Vermont and New Hamp-
shire, he was also instrumental in helping his 
town and state to promote regional health, 
economic renewal, and prosperity. In that re-
gard, Dr. Terry was on the Board of Directors 
of the Mas coma Savings Bank for 18 years, 
many of which as Chair of the bank’s founda-
tion directing charitable contributions to local, 
regional and state organizations. 
My brave state of Vermont may be small, 
but it is large in its spirit of community and 
service. Madam Speaker, that is why I take 
great pleasure in recounting the many com-
mendable attributes and service of my con-
stituent, Dr. Terry for the House and the na-
tion. It clearly demonstrates the work that one 
individual can do for his town, state and the 
nation to make it a better place to live and 
work. 
I am pleased to congratulate Dr. Thomas 
Terry and to thank him for his long service on 
behalf of our Vermont community. He is one 
of our ‘‘indomitable people.’’

HONORING SOUTH METRO FIRE 
RESCUE CHIEF JERRY RHODES 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
today to recognize the achievements of Jerry 
Rhodes who is retiring as an Assistant Fire 
Chief of the South Metro Fire Rescue Fire 
Protection District in Colorado’s 6th District. 
Jerry Rhodes is a proud 8th generation 
member of the fire service who started his ca-
reer on August 20, 1974 with the City of Glen-
dale Fire Department. There he served in 
many critical roles including Paramedic and 
Assistant Chief of Fire Prevention. His career 
continued with the Cunningham Fire Protec-
tion District in Colorado where he worked his 
way up to Fire Chief. 
Throughout his career, Jerry has served on 
countless boards and committees to further 
the efforts of fire and emergency medical serv-
ices and has given back to the community in 
so many ways, including his service as ad-
junct instructor for community colleges and 
universities. His leadership and outreach with 
elected officials, community groups, religious 
institutions, and professional organizations 
sets the standard for future fire service organi-
zations. Jerry’s contributions to the community 
and fire service have been celebrated through 
many honorable distinctions and awards. 
In 2018, Jerry was instrumental in the con-
solidation of the Cunningham Fire Protection 
District, South Metro Fire Rescue, and Little-
ton Fire Rescue into a single fire protection 
district that will improve the quality and long- 
term sustainability of prevention, mitigation, 
and emergency response services across a 
community of 287 square miles. 
As Jerry Rhodes retires, we want to express 
our sincere gratitude for his dedication, hard 
work, leadership, and service he has provided 
to the citizens and members of the South 
Metro Fire Rescue Fire Protection District and 
to the entire fire service for the past 46 years.

Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise

Palmer of Waterford, Connecticut. My friend 
Sharon passed away at her home in Con-
necticut on Friday, December 4th, 2020. She 
was 77 years old. 
Sharon’s life represents the best of Con-
necticut. A longtime educator, labor leader, 
and ultimately, Labor Commissioner, Sharon 
dedicated her life to bettering the education of 
our children and the circumstances in which 
we work. She will be remembered as an ener-
getic force to be reckoned with, solid in her 
values, and strong in her accomplishments. 
A lifelong learner, Sharon graduated from 
East Hampton High School in 1961, earned a 
Bachelor of Science from St. Joseph College, 
and a master’s in Marine Science from East-
ern Connecticut state in 1978. Soon after, she 
began a passionate teaching career at Nathan 
Hale-Ray High School in Moodus, Con-
necticut. She later taught math and science at 
Clark Lane Jr. High School, and even took her 
dedication to teaching on an international tour 
by joining the Department of Defense and 
teaching our servicemembers’ children in Han-
over, Germany. 
One way or another, Sharon was always a 
force for good in Connecticut. During her time 
teaching in Waterford, she started planting 
seeds for a second career outside of the 
classroom—still aiming to serve and advocate 
for others—as treasurer and then president of 
her local AFT chapter. In her never-ending 
quest to fight for the betterment of her com-
munity, Sharon also became a fervent voice in 
local politics as a member of Waterford’s Rep-
resentative Town Meeting. Despite constantly 
taking on new roles throughout her life, she 
would continue to serve in her municipal gov-
ernment for over 23 years. 
In 1989, Sharon grew from her role as a 
local chapter president and became the first 
vice-president of AFT-CT. She kept that posi-
tion for 12 years before she took on the exec-
utive vice president position for another two, 
and then ultimately was elected as President 
of the state’s second largest teacher’s union in 
2003. She has been one of the most notable 
union leaders in the state and could often be 
found testifying at Connecticut’s state Capitol 
in Hartford. It was because of her high profile 
and her vibrant credibility within the labor com-
munity that she was appointed as former Gov-
ernor Dannel Malloy’s first Labor Commis-
sioner. It was only then that she would step 
down from her leadership positions both in 
Waterford and as President of AFT-CT. Before 
retiring from a consecutive 58-year long ca-
reer, she became a vital part of the state gov-
ernment, acting as a strong, critical voice for 
the working community and an liaison to local 
labor organizations. 
Madam Speaker, it has been an honor to 
witness Sharon Palmer’s service in action and 
especially to be her friend. Hers is a proud 
legacy—one that will continue the good fight 
for years to come—and I ask that the entire 
House join me in continuing her legacy by 
never losing sight of the fight for working fami-
lies.

HONORING 
NANCY 
STERN 
FOR 
HER 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
THE 
EASTERN SHORE RURAL HEALTH 
SYSTEM 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and recognize Nancy Stern upon her re-
tirement from Eastern Shore Rural Health Sys-
tem, Inc. 
For over 20 years, Nancy has led Rural 
Health as the center’s Chief Executive Office. 
In her time as CEO and beyond, Nancy has 
exhibited extraordinary passion for the Eastern 
Shore community and has been a staunch ad-
vocate for Community Health Centers nation-
wide. 
Nancy began her career as a health educa-
tor, originally working part-time as she raised 
her young family. She worked in health edu-
cation for over a decade before taking the role 
of Director of Human Resources for Rural 
Health. After three years in this role and an-
other two years as the Director Operations, 
Nancy was appointed as Rural Health’s CEO 
where she has remained for the last 20 years. 
Nancy has been a key figure in Rural 
Health’s growth, modernization, and expansion 
to meet 21st century standards. Under Nan-
cy’s leadership, Rural Health added adult den-
tal and behavior health care to better assist 
Eastern Shore residents. Nancy also oversaw 
the Eastville Community Health Center’s con-
struction as well as the expansion and re-
placement of the Onley and Atlantic Commu-
nity Health Centers respectively. Additionally, 
she led Rural Health in acquiring a partnership 
with Kiwanis International for the Chin-
coteague Community Health Center. In her 
20-year tenure, Rural Health’s workforce ex-
panded from 100 employees to 300 and in-
creased its budget from $6 million to $29 mil-
lion today. 
Nancy’s dedication to providing for the 
health and well being of the Eastern Shore 
community is truly inspiring. I am proud to 
honor and recognize her leadership and the 
role she has played in making our community 
a better place. Coastal Virginia is a better 
place because of her efforts.

HONORING TOM BROWN 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to congratulate Thomas 
Brown on his retirement and thank him for his 
many meaningful years of service to the Sixth 
Congressional District of Missouri. 
Tom has been a crucial member of my team 
in the House of Representatives for fifteen 
years, and his impact on Missouri’s Sixth Con-
gressional District cannot be overstated. In 
2005, Tom joined my team as Chief of Staff, 
and has since held multiple other titles, includ-
ing District Director and Senior Advisor. Tom’s 
wealth of knowledge about Missouri and the 
needs of the constituents in the Sixth Con-
gressional District made him both an effective 
leader in the office and an invaluable voice for 
the district. In the past fifteen years, Tom has 
made himself known as a true force to be 
reckoned with, using his wide network of rela-
tionships and his unmatched experience in the 
region to bring real change to Missourians. 
Tom’s dedication to the people of Missouri 
is in no way limited to his time on my staff. 
Before joining our team, Tom served as a 
Clay County Commissioner, Chairman of the 
Missouri Lottery Commission, and the Chair-
man of the Board at Saint Luke’s North Hos-
pital. Tom has also served on boards for the 
Mid-America Regional Council, Tri-County 
Mental Health, and Synergy Services. His tire-
less efforts on behalf of Missouri will be felt 
long after his time on staff comes to an end. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in recognizing Tom Brown for his commit-
ment to the Northland, Missouri’s Congres-
sional Sixth District, and the entire Show Me 
State. I am honored to have worked with him 
for the past 15 years and am honored to call 
him, and his family, my friends and neighbors.

IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT 
OF TOM VANKIRK 
HON. CONOR LAMB 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the retirement of Tom VanKirk, Ex-
ecutive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer 
at Highmark Health on December 31, 2020. 
Mr. VanKirk joined Highmark Inc. in March 
2012 following a 41-year career at Buchanan, 
Ingersoll & Rooney. In addition to overseeing 
the acquisition of West Penn Allegheny Hos-
pital System and Jefferson Hospital as well as 
the formation of Highmark Health in 2013 and 
its affiliation with Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
of northeast Pennsylvania in 2015, he has 
managed the legal affairs of the company and 
the legal department, and serves on the com-
pany’s leadership team. He was also instru-
mental in the formation of Highmark Health’s 
strategic partnerships with Johns Hopkins 
Medicine and Penn State Health. Mr. VanKirk 
also serves as the secretary of the board of 
directors of Highmark Inc. and Highmark 
Health. 
Prior to joining Highmark in 2012, Mr. 
VanKirk served as Chairman and CEO at 
Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney from 2003 until 
2009, and Chairman until 2012, where he pro-
vided strategic leadership, client relationship 
development and attorney recruitment. He 
also managed the merger of three major law 
firms into Buchanan. Mr. VanKirk served as 
COO for 18 years from 1985 to 2003 before 
becoming CEO at Buchanan Ingersoll. He was 
a corporate takeover and antitrust trial lawyer 
and corporate advisor to many Fortune 1,000 
companies. 
As a community leader, Mr. VanKirk is in-
volved in many civic and non-profit initiatives 
throughout the Pittsburgh region. He serves 
on the Executive Committee of the Pittsburgh 
Cultural Trust, the Pennsylvania Economy 
League and Chaired the Pennsylvania Busi-
ness Council Board. In addition, Mr. VanKirk is 
a trustee of the University of Pittsburgh, the 
YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh, United Way, the 
Board of visitors of the PITT School of Social 
Work, The Carnegie Museum, and on the 
board of Penn State Health. 
Mr. VanKirk and his wife Bonnie have been 
involved in the founding of both the Hillman 
Cancer Center and the August Wilson Center, 
two vital Pittsburgh institutions. He is a grad-
uate of two great Pennsylvania schools. 
Bucknell and Penn State Dickinson School of 
Law. 
[From Penn State University Newswire] 
According to a recent news article looking 
back on his life and contributions to our 
community, ‘‘When Mr. VanKirk, 1970, at-
tended Penn State Dickinson Law five dec-
ades ago, it was a time of tremendous unrest. 
The civil rights movement and protests 
against the Vietnam War were peaking, and 
VanKirk felt drawn to the field of law.’’ 
Said Mr. VanKirk of this experience, ‘‘I 
think the law has always been a great place 
to make a meaningful and lasting impact on 
society.’’ 
On behalf of the constituents of Pennsylva-
nia’s 17th Congressional District, I would like 
to congratulate Mr. VanKirk on his retirement 
and thank him for his tireless work to enhance 
the quality of life of our community.

HONORING JACQUIE SULLIVAN ON 
HER 
RETIREMENT 
AS 
COUNCILMEMBER 
ON 
THE 
BA-
KERSFIELD CITY COUNCIL 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Bakersfield’s longest-serving 
City Councilmember, Jacquie Sullivan, a con-
stituent and longtime friend. Years ago, I re-
member calling Jacquie to encourage her to 
run for City Council. Now as she prepares to 
retire, I am honored to recognize her legacy 
and thank her for 25 years of public service to 
the city of Bakersfield and Kern County. 
Born in Bakersfield, Jacquie attended local 
public schools and later moved north, grad-
uating from Tahoe Truckee High School. Soon 
after earning her high school diploma, she se-
cured her real estate license and, while raising 
four children, entered the rental investment in-
dustry. In 1993, after the loss of her daughter 
Joyce, Jacquie, despite her soft-spoken na-
ture, became one of our community’s out-
spoken voices helping to change the stigma 
surrounding HIV and AIDS. She worked to 
educate the next generation, drive awareness 
of the disease, and advocated for more fund-
ing for treatments and prevention. Through her 
advocacy, Jacquie spoke at many Kern Coun-
ty school functions and helped raise thou-
sands of dollars to provide better care for 
those afflicted with HIV/AIDS. 
In 1995, Jacquie was elected to the Bakers-
field City Council. As Councilmember for Ward 
Six, she worked with her colleagues to 
prioritize neighborhood safety, affordable fam-
ily living, and promoting prosperity in her ward 
and across Bakersfield. During her tenure, she 
enhanced resident quality of life by stream-
lining building projects, introducing a city 
framework for emergency funding, and fos-
tering economic growth opportunities for small 
businesses. 
Jacquie’s advocacy and legacy, however, is 
not confined just to the borders of Bakersfield,

California. In 2002, she founded In God We 
Trust America, Inc., a nonprofit organization 
that encourages elected officials to display our 
national motto ‘‘In God We Trust’’ in public 
spaces like at town halls and other facilities. 
As a result of this nonprofit, more than 700 
buildings at various levels of government 
throughout 37 states have the motto displayed 
including the Bakersfield City Council Cham-
bers, as well as the Kern County Sheriff’s De-
partment, which recently added motto decals 
to its patrol vehicles. 
It has been a pleasure to work with my 
close friend Jacquie, collaborating with her on 
issues impacting our community to improve 
the lives of our constituents. While her pres-
ence and passion on the Bakersfield City 
Council will certainly be missed, I have no 
doubt she will continue to advocate for the 
policies and programs that she holds dear. On 
behalf of the 23rd Congressional District of 
California, I thank Jacquie for her service and 
wish her well as she begins this new chapter 
enjoying time with her children, Richard, Julie, 
and Linda, and her grandchildren.

TRIBUTE TO DAVID KENNETT 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to a dedicated and 
trusted member of my staff. At the end of this 
Congress, my Chief of Staff, David Kennett, 
will be departing my office after many years of 
invaluable service. 
After graduating from Delaware County 
Christian School in 1990, Dave attended 
Wheaton College where he earned a Bachelor 
of Arts degree in English and History. While 
working at Houlihan’s restaurant in Springfield, 
Virginia, Dave first joined my D.C. office as an 
intern. After writing up a well-researched 
memo on the history of Puerto Rico, Dave 
was offered a job as our staff assistant by my 
first Chief of Staff, Ed Slevin. He was soon 
promoted to a legislative assistant position, re-
sponsible for a portfolio that included infra-
structure and natural resources issues. In 
1998, Dave left my office, for the first time, to 
move to California. 
Dave and his family would wind up moving 
back to D.C. and he rejoined my office to 
serve as my legislative director in 2001, a post 
he would fill until leaving for the second time, 
in 2003 to join The Ferguson Group, where he 
worked as a federal advocate on behalf of a 
number of Riverside County organizations, in-
cluding the Western Municipal Water District 
and the Riverside Community College District. 
In 2016, following the departure of my long-
time Chief of Staff, David Ramey, Dave once 
again joined my office to serve in that leader-
ship role. His third stint in my office began just 
as a new Republican administration was form-
ing and Dave played a big role in helping 
qualified Californians find roles to serve in our 
federal agencies. Dave staffed our weekly 
California Republican Delegation lunches as 
well as aided me in my role this past Con-
gress as a Deputy Chair of the National Re-
publican Congressional Committee. 
Dave’s immeasurable contributions to my of-
fice, the constituents I have represented and 
to our country are something for which we 
should all be very grateful. Personally, I have 
and will continue to value my friendship with 
Dave and wish him and his wife Catherine, 
their daughter Carolyn and son David the very 
best and brightest future.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
COACH WALLY BUMPAS 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, Coach Wally 
Bumpas was an icon to the many young men 
and women he mentored, and I’m honored to 
have known him when he coached at Brandon 
High School. Coach Bumpas taught history 
and coached football in Lambert, Shelby, Wi-
nona, Jackson, McComb, and Brandon, Mis-
sissippi, and in 1990 was inducted into the 
Mississippi Association of Coaches Hall of 
Fame. He loved his players and seeing them 
advance in their careers and personal lives. 
Coach Bumpas was an avid reader, especially 
of World War II history, and he found great 
pleasure in traveling and fishing. Among his 
fondest times were trips to Europe and an Af-
rican safari with his wife, Kennie, and fly fish-
ing in the Bahamas with many friends includ-
ing Quinton Dickerson, Dave Goldberg, and 
Charlie Modica, Jr. They thoroughly enjoyed 
his company and advice, and they cherish the 
photos, stories, and memories of the time they 
shared together. 
After retiring from a longtime coaching ca-
reer in 1995, Coach Bumpas was hired at his 
retirement party by former Mississippi Gov-
ernor Kirk Fordice. Working in Governor 
Fordice’s successful re-election campaign that 
year with many new friends including Lisa 
Buelow Ireland, Coach Bumpas began a sec-
ond career in politics and public service. In 
1996, Coach Bumpas worked on the success-
ful campaign of former Mississippi Third Dis-
trict Congressman Charles W. ‘‘Chip’’ Pick-
ering, Jr. He subsequently served for many 
years on Congressman Pickering’s congres-
sional staff in Mississippi. Congressman Pick-
ering always considered Coach Bumpas to be 
a loyal, trusted friend and was grateful to have 
him as a member of his staff. 
Coach Bumpas also enjoyed researching 
his genealogy and learned he descended from 
French Huguenot Eduod Bompasse, who ar-
rived at Plymouth on the ‘‘Good Ship For-
tune,’’ the first boat to arrive after the 
Mayflower, on November 10, 1621. In recent 
years, Coach spent his days enjoying his 
home on Lake Lorman in Madison County, 
Mississippi. Coach Wally Bumpas passed 
away at the age of 84 on December 6, 2020, 
surrounded by family. He is survived by his 
wife and the love of his life, the former Kennie 
Tuth Robison, whom he married on July 23, 
1961, at St. John’s Catholic Church in Oxford, 
MS. He is also survived by son Wally 
Bumpas, Jr. and wife Reni, daughter Elizabeth 
‘‘Sis’’ Bumpas, son Ken Bumpas and wife 
Lisa. as well as seven grandchildren and four 
great-grandchildren. Coach Bumpas was pre-
ceded in death by his brother Gilbert Dell 
Bumpas, Jr. 
Through his actions of encouragement to 
thousands of people he knew, Coach Bumpas 
left Mississippi a better place than he found it. 
He will be missed greatly by those who knew 
him, but the lessons he instilled in so many 
will continue to positively impact lives for many 
years to come.

HONORING 
SCOTT 
CUNNINGHAM, 
SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE RANK-
ING MEMBER FOR THE HOUSE 
ETHICS COMMITTEE 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Scott Cunningham, a 
member of my staff for over thirteen years, for 
his outstanding and dedicated service to the 
United States House of Representatives and 
to the Twenty-Fourth Congressional District of 
Texas. 
A Dallas native, Scott first came to Capitol 
Hill in 1999 as a congressional intern for Con-
gressman Pete Sessions and would return to 
intern again for each of the next two summers. 
In 2007, he joined my staff and has continued 
to serve the people of the 24th District of 
Texas with energy and integrity, first as my 
policy director and then as my legislative di-
rector and deputy chief of staff. He is currently 
my senior advisor, counseling and supporting 
me in my role as the Ranking Member of the 
House Ethics Committee. 
Much of Scott’s day-to-day work is now be-
hind-the-scenes, but his passion for public pol-
icy is still evident. He has handled each issue 
area for my team at some point during his ten-
ure, even serving as a one-man legislative 
team for five months. As hectic as that time 
may have been, I also know that Scott 
stresses about nothing more than managing 
my flights. I am sure I would not have made 
it to Washington every week without him. 
Scott’s contributions were not limited to leg-
islative work. He is known for his servant’s 
heart and is never happier than when he is 
able to help a constituent with a casework 
issue. Whether it takes only five minutes or a 
full five years to solve, Scott is always deter-
mined to see a job through to the end. He 
came to Capitol Hill all those years ago to 
help people, especially his fellow Texans, and 
any of my constituents who have worked with 
him can attest to the fact that he has suc-
ceeded. 
I am not sure what my tenure in Congress 
would 
have 
been 
like 
without 
Scott 
Cunningham as part of my team, and not only 
because he drew the first-place selection in 
the Congressional office lottery twice for me 
and his coworkers. Scott’s loyalty, determina-
tion, and focus on giving back all informed 
how my team and I approached our work here 
on Capitol Hill. On behalf of myself and the 
people of Texas’s 24th District, I thank him for 
his thirteen years of service and wish him the 
very best on his future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. AHMAD 
JABER 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the memory of the late Dr. Ahmad 
Jaber, a physician and founder of the Arab 
American Association of New York, a human 
rights advocacy organization. 
Dr. Jaber was born and raised by his wid-
owed mother in the Palestinian village of 
Yamoun in the West Bank. Following the ex-
ample of his mother, Dr. Jaber worked hard to 
put himself through college and medical 
school. He immigrated to the United States in 
1974 to pursue a medical career in obstetrics. 
While he is well-known for having delivered 
more than five thousand babies over the 
course of his career, Dr. Jaber was celebrated 
for his generosity and advocacy on behalf of 
others. 
Dr. Jaber founded the Arab American Asso-
ciation of New York as a welcoming center for 
new immigrants to New York from the Middle 
East. Under his leadership, the organization 
grew to become a social services organization 
that provides adult education services, youth 
programming, and mental health services. 
More than that, the organization seeks to cre-
ate cross-culture dialogue within New York’s 
multiethnic communities. It has served as a li-
aison to challenge discrimination against Arab 
Americans. 
I invite you to join me in recognizing the leg-
acy of Dr. Ahmad Jaber as we give honor to 
his memory.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COMMU-
NITY 
DRIVEN 
RECOVERY 
FOR 
PUERTO RICO ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce the Community Driven 
Recovery for Puerto Rico Act along with my 
colleague from New York, ADRIANO ESPAILLAT. 
This bill strengthens transparency and local 
oversight of federal recovery efforts in Puerto 
Rico by establishing a Civil Society Task 
Force to ensure that Puerto Ricans have a 
seat at the table in decisions about recovery 
efforts. 
More than three years since Hurricane 
Maria hit Puerto Rico, the island is still dev-
astated and Puerto Rican voices have been 
shut out of the federal recovery process. The 
Civil Society Task Force established by this 
bill will represent different sectors of Puerto 
Rican society including community organiza-
tions, unions, nonprofits and small businesses. 
The Task Force will be embedded within fed-
eral recovery agencies to ensure that the 
Puerto Rican community’s ideas and concerns 
are incorporated into the recovery process. 
The federal recovery effort in Puerto Rico 
has been removed from the people of the is-
land for too long, and this bill provides an im-
portant mechanism to bridge that gap and en-
hance the accountability, transparency and 
credibility of the process. I urge this body to 
advance this bill.

TRIBUTE TO RANDY BONNER 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to my friend Randy 
Bonner, who is stepping down this month from 
the Canyon Lake City Council. Randy is a 
community leader, a veteran, and a dedicated 
public servant whose many tireless efforts to 
better our region will be missed. 
Randy settled into his lakeshore home in 
Canyon Lake more than two decades ago 
after retiring from his two professional careers, 
which included over 35 years in the computer/ 
disk drive industry, and 28 years in the Marine 
Corps Reserves, from which he retired as a 
Colonel. His first foray into serving the small, 
gated city of Canyon Lake came in 2007 when 
Randy was elected to serve as the Canyon 
Lake POA Treasurer, then as the president in 
2008. With his experience on the Canyon 
Lake POA, Randy felt prepared to serve on 
the City Council in 2010 and was elected by 
the voters to fill that role. After a brief hiatus 
off the council, Randy was elected again in 
2016 to rejoin the council. He was selected by 
his city council colleagues to serve as the 
city’s mayor in 2014 and 2017. 
Throughout his time on the council, Randy 
has been a Board Member of the Western 
Riverside County Conservation Agency, the 
Western Riverside Council of Governments 
and the Riverside Transportation Agency. He 
has also served on the I–15 Through 
Temecula Valley Task Force and the South-
west Communities Financing Authorities Joint 
Powers Agreement (Animal Friends of the Val-
ley). Randy is also an active member of the 
Canyon Lake Men’s Golf Club, Over The Hill 
Group, After Lunch Bunch, Canyon Lake Trav-
el Club, Canyon Lake Yacht Club, and was 
the Master of Ceremonies at the first Canyon 
Lake Veterans Day event and then again in 
2010. 
I want to personally acknowledge and thank 
Randy for serving on my Academy Nomina-
tions Selection Committee, and helping to de-
termine which students from the 42nd Con-
gressional District receive nominations to our 
military service academies. I know I speak on 
behalf of all residents in expressing my heart-
felt thanks and praise for Randy’s significant 
contributions to the city of Canyon Lake. I 
wish Randy, and his family, the very best in 
the years to come.

CONGRATULATING REBECCA 
LEGGIERI ON HER RETIREMENT 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Rebecca Leggieri, Clerk 
of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, 
who will be retiring at the end of this year after 
more than 24 years of service to our country. 
Becky was born in Schenectady, New York, 
and went to St. Lawrence University on a 
ROTC scholarship. She joined the Army as a 
Quartermaster officer and rose to the rank of 
Lieutenant Colonel. Ms. Leggieri first came to 
the House as an Army Fellow for Rep. Caro-
lyn Kilpatrick of Michigan in 2009. Rep. Kil-
patrick was a member of the Subcommittee, 
and during her fellowship Becky met the com-
mittee staff and learned the mechanics of the 
appropriations process. The Committee, rec-
ognizing her talent, hired Rebecca in 2010. 
She began serving on the Defense Sub-
committee in the minority. In that capacity, she 
needed to be versed on every facet of a vast 
and complex bill that encompasses hundreds 
of thousands of people and every issue rang-
ing from day care to the delivery systems for 
nuclear weapons. This year’s bill amounts to 
nearly $700 billion and it impacts our nation’s 
security and that of our planet. Becky’s skills 
and her life experiences were all she needed 
to make the right decisions. In 2015, Becky 
Leggieri became the Subcommittee’s Minority 
Staff Director and has worked by my side for 
the past five years to ensure oversight of the 
Department of Defense and numerous intel-
ligence agencies. She balanced competing pri-
orities from administrations, Members of Con-
gress, labor. industry, state and local govern-
ments, and citizen interest groups. Her hon-
esty, knowledge of the issues, and willingness 
to listen allowed her to develop legislation in 
which the many parties involved felt a sense 
of shared ownership in its enactment. 
Becky Leggieri is a person of scrupulous 
ethics and is possessed of a sterling intellect 
and nimble mind, an innate political shrewd-
ness, and poise under pressure. Most impor-
tantly, she used these talents in the service of 
her country and this institution to ensure that 
the Committee and House’s constitutional pre-
rogatives were respected and protected. Her 
steady hand will be sorely missed. 
I know Ms. Leggieri’s husband, John, and 
her children, Olivia and Gabriel, are so very 
proud of her, as are we all. I wish Becky every 
happiness and success in her future endeav-
ors.

COMMITTEE REPORT FROM THE 
COMMITTEE ON VETERANS’ AF-

OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
as Chairman of the House Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs, to bring attention to an impor-
tant issue facing our nation’s veterans. 
During a hearing held on November 13 of 
last year, the Committee heard about the risks 
faced by our nation’s veterans when using so-
cial media. Based on the results of that hear-
ing, as well as additional research and anal-
ysis, my Committee has prepared a report that 
not only details the risks faced by veterans, 
but also outlines a series of policy options and 
other solutions. The executive summary of the 
report, ‘‘Hijacking Our Heroes: Exploiting Vet-
erans

Media,’’ is below and the full text of the report 
is available at: https://veterans.house.gov/imo/ 
media/doc/Hijacking%20Our%20Heroes.pdf. 
The threat of foreign individuals and orga-
nizations influencing United States (U.S.) 
elections by manipulating social media has 
been a persistent and growing issue since be-
fore the 2016 election year. The threat was a 
significant concern during the 2020 elections. 
Recent investigations and analysis docu-
ment the broad proliferation of online influ-
ence campaigns that originate overseas. This 
includes the use of ‘‘spoofing,’’ or the act of 
disguising 
an 
electronic 
communication 
from an unknown source as being from a 
known, trusted source. A subset of these op-
erations target the veteran and military 
service member communities in order to 
misappropriate their voices, authority and 
credibility. 
The 
pervasiveness 
of 
social 
media, as well as the nature of the specific 
threat to our election integrity and the sow-
ing of political discord makes this a critical 
issue affecting both veterans and those who 
value veterans’ voices. As described by 
Chairman of the House Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs, Mark Takano (D–CA), ‘‘the 
issue of protecting our elections from foreign 
influence is one of critical importance to all 
Americans and preserving the power of vet-
erans’ voices should be of equal concern to us 
all. 
On Wednesday, November 13, 2019, the 
House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs held 
an investigative hearing to examine the na-
ture and scope of threats posed to the vet-
erans’ community through ‘‘internet spoof-
ing.’’ Experts testified that stolen, misappro-
priated, or fraudulently created social media 
accounts can be used to target veterans for 
the purposes of disseminating political prop-
aganda and fake news in order to influence 
elections. The witnesses also described ro-
mance scams and commercial fraud being 
perpetrated using spoofing techniques. Rep-
resentatives of three major social media 
platforms—Facebook, Instagram, and Twit-
ter—discussed how they are addressing this 
threat, particularly considering the 2020 
elections, and described best practices for in-
formation sharing, protective measures, and 
law enforcement cooperation. The Com-
mittee later held a briefing on January 14, 
2020, with representatives from several com-
ponents of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI) that handle law enforcement for 
online crimes. 
Ranking Member Dr. David P. Roe (R–TN) 
noted during the hearing, ‘‘The evidence is 
clear that veterans have their identity mis-
appropriated and that they, like other social 
media users, could be targets for propaganda 
or scams.’’ Although everyone who uses the 
internet 
is 
subject 
to 
online 
scams, 
spamming, phishing, identity theft, and 
other such risks, veterans are particularly 
susceptible to internet spoofing based on 
their higher propensity for political engage-
ment (including running for office, volun-
teering, and sharing political opinions and 
information). For the purposes of dissemi-
nating political propaganda or exerting in-
fluence on dividing Americans on sensitive 
political ‘‘wedge issues,’’ veterans are tar-
geted because of their close identification 
with strong national security policies, patri-
otism, personal sacrifice, and honor. 
Chairman Takano stated during the hear-
ing, ‘‘By impersonating veterans, these for-
eign actors are effectively eroding the hard- 
earned power and integrity of veterans’ 
voices.’’ 
Veterans are more likely to be engaged in 
their communities, be perceived as leaders, 
and can exert influence on political matters 
(particularly with respect to defense and na-
tional security matters). Therefore, a suc-
cessful spoofing scam that results in a vet-
eran or Veteran Service Organization (VSO) 
unknowingly distributing or endorsing a 
piece of disinformation can yield greatly in-
creased, and sometimes even exponential, re-
sults due to the added credibility imparted 
to that disinformation by virtue of its ap-
proval by the veteran or VSO. With each suc-
cessive endorsement or share, the credibility 
of the disinformation snowballs. The collec-
tive association with actual veterans and 
VSOs makes it increasingly unlikely that 
the disinformation will be closely scruti-
nized, questioned, or eventually exposed as 
fraudulent 
or 
misleading. 
Moreover, 
scammers also try to spoof veterans to gain 
leverage over them. Many veterans move 
into jobs requiring security clearances or 
within the federal government after they 
leave the military—those positions can be 
jeopardized if the veteran is compromised 
through financial fraud, identity theft, or 
otherwise becomes susceptible to blackmail. 
Internet spoofing became a visible problem 
in the context of the 2016 U.S. election, when 
foreign disinformation spread widely across 
social 
media, 
including 
Facebook, 
Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, among 
others. However, disinformation on social 
media and information operations conducted 
by sophisticated actors have occurred for far 
longer. In the past few years, foreign infor-
mation operations have targeted divisive po-
litical issues within American society and 
have sought to manipulate and divide polit-
ical and social communities. Unfortunately, 
our military and veterans’ communities are 
no exception. Moreover, the incidents of for-
eign spoofing increased following the 2016 
election, and industry experts project that 
these numbers will continue to increase 
through 2020 and beyond. Russia’s Internet 
Research Agency (IRA), a Russian company 
which has engaged in online influence oper-
ations, more commonly known as a ‘‘troll 
farm,’’ dramatically expanded its informa-
tion operations after the 2016 U.S. Presi-
dential elections, both in terms of volume 
and intensity. Russia and Iran are the most 
prominent state actors in this context, but 
recent work has identified additional state 
actors, such as China and Saudi Arabia, 
using information operations to target com-
munities and topics of interests. 
The Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence published a five-volume bipartisan 
report focused on Russia’s influence oper-
ations. The second volume focused on Rus-
sia’s use of social media platforms to influ-
ence the election, while the third volume fo-
cused on the shortcomings of Obama Admin-
istration efforts to combat the ongoing at-
tacks. The third volume highlighted the lack 
of legislative or regulatory action to combat 
a known threat emanating from Russia and 
its intelligence services. The Senate Report 
sheds light on the broader issues of misin-
formation campaigns and predatory schemes 
targeting veterans presented in a report pre-
pared by the Vietnam Veterans of America 
(VVA). 
Industry analysts, journalists, and law en-
forcement agree that the problems of inter-
net spoofing and foreign influence exerted 
through social media continue to grow at an 
alarming pace. However, neither the major 
platforms nor the FBI were able to identify 
an obvious or comprehensive solution to this 
ongoing problem. Both continue to devote 
significant resources towards combatting 
spoofing. However, the foreign entities who 
perpetrate much of this illicit activity are 
becoming 
more 
sophisticated 
in 
their 
schemes and are targeting broader swaths of 
internet users to more quickly and effi-
ciently disseminate their fraudulent mes-
saging before they are identified and deacti-
vated. 
Facebook and Twitter note that auto-
mated systems can struggle to differentiate 
authentic images and accounts from fraudu-
lent, unauthorized, or duplicated accounts 
and thereby risk erroneously flagging and re-
moving legitimate accounts. The platforms 
have chosen to err on the side of minimizing 
false negatives by relying upon patterns of 
suspicious activity and certain tactics or 
techniques, rather than on other identifying 
data (e.g., duplicative names or images, 
geolocation information, or ostensible orga-
nizational affiliations). Suspicious activity 
patterns, such as irregular, repetitive, or vo-
luminous posting, triggers additional layers 
of review, including an examination of the 
geolocation data in order to assess where the 
suspicious activity may be originating. The 
final review and removal decisions some-
times warrant human examination, but often 
removals are made without any human re-
view. Although these layered review proc-
esses may be effective in protecting legiti-
mate users, they undoubtedly also add a sig-
nificant gap in removal time for fraudulent 
accounts, which provides a window within 
which spoofers can continue to operate. 
Law enforcement agencies, such as the 
FBI, are constrained in their abilities to effi-
ciently identify and eliminate spoofers be-
cause the agencies only have limited access 
to the data held by the social media plat-
forms. Often these agencies do not receive 
important information until after the plat-
forms have already removed a spoofed ac-
count, at which point law enforcement is un-
able to actively monitor and trace the ac-
count in real time. 
The ability of spoofers to operate from 
overseas, anonymously, or by using fraudu-
lent or concealed identities requires law en-
forcement to rely upon account identifica-
tion data and detailed activity patterns in 
order to accurately identify or locate the po-
tential spoofer. However, Title II of the Elec-
tronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) 
(18 U.S.C. §§ 2701–2713), known as the Stored 
Communications Act, requires a government 
entity to serve a subpoena on social media 
platforms to compel the production of cer-
tain relevant information. Requiring a time- 
consuming legal process to obtain identifica-
tion data hampers the ability of law enforce-
ment to respond quickly or to fully under-
stand the scope of a potential spoofing cam-
paign. Therefore, the law enforcement agen-
cies recommend increasing the amount and 
level of detail that the platforms can easily 
provide to the authorities. 
Past attempts to address this problem 
have been piecemeal in nature and have 
proven ineffective to date. This fragmented 
approach has prevented any wholesale, sys-
temic efforts to tighten rules or law enforce-
ment protocols. Incremental adjustments 
have been made by individual platforms, 
which leaves an irregular landscape where 
motivated, corrupt actors may still be able 
to exploit weaknesses among the platforms. 
Based on discussions with representatives 
of law enforcement, and considering the 
issues raised by the social media platforms 
during the hearing, the Committee believes 
that there are additional measures needed to 
address the growing threats posed by spoof-
ing. Our recommendations fall into two 
broad categories. 
The first category is oriented at users of 
social media and is defensive in nature, such 
as teaching users how to be aware of the dan-
gers posed by spoofers on social media and 
training them how to protect themselves 
through heightened vigilance, healthy skep-
ticism, and adherence to basic principles of 
cyber-hygiene. 
The second category is aimed at putting 
the social media platforms and law enforce-
ment on the offensive and developing robust

mechanisms to more effectively identify and 
quickly eliminate foreign-based spoofers. 
While the first category is likely to be less 
costly and easier to implement, the second 
category may ultimately prove to be more 
effective in bringing the threat under con-
trol.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF JEWEL 
WARE 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
acknowledge the loss of a great public servant 
for the 13th Congressional District, Wayne 
County Commissioner Jewel Ware, and honor 
her memory and legacy as a commissioner for 
our district. 
First elected in 1994, Ms. Ware was the 
longest-serving Wayne County Commissioner, 
with a district that covered a large portion of 
Detroit. She was particularly well-known for 
her commitment to serving senior residents 
and her work to improve access to mental 
healthcare. She worked directly with commu-
nity-based organizations to champion issues 
important to the residents of the communities 
she served. Most recently, Commissioner 
Ware had sponsored a resolution that would 
ban on chokeholds and restraint by police in 
using deadly force. 
Beyond her legislative work, Ms. Ware vol-
unteered her time and energy in public service 
with a number of organizations, including the 
NAACP and The Charles. H. Wright Museum 
of African American History. She spearheaded 
an annual sock and mitten drive for children in 
need. Ms. Ware could frequently be found vis-
iting senior housing, coordinating services 
such as free income tax preparation. Commis-
sioner Ware also served as a member of Zeta 
Phi Beta Incorporated where she dedicated a 
lot of her time to serving others. I am truly 
saddened by the loss for our Wayne County 
and Detroit communities and am deeply grate-
ful for the time we shared in public service to-
gether over the last decade. Her passing is 
truly a great loss to our district, but her pres-
ence will forever be felt in our community. 
Please join me in tribute to Wayne County 
Commissioner Jewel Ware, as we remember 
her life and extraordinary contributions to 
Wayne County and the 13th Congressional 
District.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF ANNE EVANS 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor an energetic and tireless advocate for 
Connecticut businesses, Anne Evans, on her 
incredible career. When she retires at the end 
of this month, the state will lose one of the 
most enthusiastic and genuine advocates for 
local economic development after a life of 
working for and with small and local busi-
nesses. 
Anne has served for 13 years as District Di-
rector of the U.S. Department of Commerce 
International Trade Administration District Of-
fice in Middletown, Connecticut. In that posi-
tion, she has brought Connecticut businesses 
and ingenuity to the global marketplace. As a 
Department of Commerce Employee, she took 
her role as a public servant seriously, pro-
viding local businesses with the sort of global 
perspective and expertise they need to grow 
into new markets. Before joining the Com-
merce Department, Anne worked for decades 
in the private sector in her family’s tire busi-
ness and ultimately became a world-recog-
nized leader in tire recycling products in Eu-
rope and the U.S. That background made her 
particularly well equipped to assist small busi-
nesses cope with the sometimes daunting 
challenges of the global marketplace. 
Like all good public servants, Anne’s pas-
sion and enthusiasm comes from a true affec-
tion for our state and its people. 
Anne has worked to help well over 2,500 
Connecticut companies export their products 
and attract customers overseas—providing an 
enormous economic boon to our State and 
providing a place for Connecticut on the na-
tional business stage. Additionally, she has 
worked extensively with Connecticut veterans 
and National Guard reservists, spearheading 
the Veterans Workforce Development Program 
and helping countless veterans receive train-
ing and find private sector employment in 
Connecticut. 
In recent years, Anne worked closely with 
my office on major events to support Con-
necticut’s aerospace and defense industries— 
and just last year, hundreds of people came to 
Connecticut during the International Space 
Summit to engage with Connecticut compa-
nies. Anne helped expand agricultural exports 
abroad for smaller family farmers in Con-
necticut, assisted small suppliers in becoming 
part of the submarine supply chain, and made 
countless connections across industries and 
countries to help create win-win opportunities 
for everyone. 
Anne’s ingenuity, entrepreneurship, and cre-
ative thinking has been instrumental not just in 
helping Connecticut’s economy, but globally. I 
have fond memories of the many trade mis-
sions that she and I organized and led to-
gether—from Canada to Northern Ireland to 
Israel. 
I thank Anne for her tireless work for Con-
necticut. I will truly miss having her at Com-
merce but look forward to seeing where she 
lands next. I know that she will be successful 
in anything she does in the future. 
Congratulations on her well-deserved retire-
ment.

TRIBUTE TO YOLANDA CARRILLO 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to my dear friend Yo-
landa Carrillo, who will be stepping down from 
the Corona City Council this month. Yolanda 
is a passionate advocate and a true leader 
who has made a significant lifetime contribu-
tion to my hometown of Corona, California. 
In October of 2018, the Corona City Council 
voted unanimously to approve the appoint-
ment of Yolanda to the Council to fill the va-
cancy left by Dick Haley who resigned due to 
health concerns. Yolanda was a natural choice 
to sit on the City Council considering her deep 
knowledge of and involvement in the commu-
nity. She currently serves as the Executive Di-
rector/CEO 
of 
the 
Corona-Norco 
Family 
YMCA, an organization she has been a part of 
since 1996. Just prior to her appointment to 
the City Council, Yolanda was appointed as a 
Planning Commissioner for the City of Coro-
na’s Planning and Housing Commission. 
Yolanda has served in many different ca-
pacities for her city, county, and state organi-
zations. She has been a board member of the 
Corona Police Community Partnership, Co-
rona Chamber of Commerce, UNITY, and 
Simple Acts of Care and Kindness. She is 
also a member of the Corona Woman’s Im-
provement Club, Corona Rotary Noon Club, 
Corona Elks Lodge, the Navy League, among 
many other organizations. I, like many others 
in our community, know from experience that 
when Yolanda becomes an advocate of a 
cause, you better get on board or get out of 
the way. Her passion and determination are 
second to none. 
I know I speak on behalf of all Corona resi-
dents in expressing my heartfelt thanks and 
praise for Yolanda’s many contributions to the 
City of Corona. I wish Yolanda and her hus-
band, Ed, the very best in the future.

HONORING 
PEGGY 
BREEDEN 
ON 
HER RETIREMENT AS MAYOR OF 
THE CITY OF RIDGECREST 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Peggy Breeden, a community 
leader, cancer survivor, friend, and Mayor of 
Ridgecrest, California. After having led the 
City of Ridgecrest over the last six years, 
Peggy is retiring as Mayor. 
Peggy was born in Syracuse, New York on 
her family’s dairy farm where she and her sib-
lings all worked tending and milking over 100 
cows that their family raised. In fact, Peggy’s 
family farm only received electricity in 1952, 
making her no stranger to hard work in the 
face of adversity. In 1982, she moved to 
Ridgecrest to be with friends and family and 
went on to own the Swap Sheet, a local ad-
vertising weekly newspaper. But she also had 
a calling for public service. In addition to man-
aging her business, she served on numerous 
local boards and foundations, including the In-
dian Wells Valley Water District, Cerro Coso 
Community College Foundation Board, the 
Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District, and 
the Navy Community Council. 
She took her commitment to serving the 
community of Ridgecrest a step further by 
successfully running for Mayor, making history 
both as Ridgecrest’s first female mayor and as 
the first elected mayor since the office became 
its own position directly elected by city voters. 
Peggy’s soft-spoken and unassuming manner 
should not understate her intense dedication 
to Ridgecrest, demonstrated leadership skills, 
and political acumen. She showcased these 
qualities as she dealt with one of the largest 
crises to ever face Ridgecrest. 
In July 2019, Ridgecrest experienced the 
largest earthquakes in over 20 years, which

included two separate 6.4 and 7.1 magnitude 
earthquakes that did an estimated $3 billion of 
damage in the City and to the surrounding 
communities of Eastern Kern County, includ-
ing Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. 
Peggy sprang into action right away to help 
the residents of her community, working tire-
lessly with State and Federal officials to en-
sure that buildings and infrastructure were 
safe and that residents had access to food, 
shelter, and water immediately following the 
natural disaster. In the aftermath of the earth-
quakes, Peggy successfully worked to ensure 
that the President of the United States de-
clared a Major Disaster, which opened Federal 
assistance programs and funding for displaced 
homeowners, renters, and businessowners so 
life could return to normal as quickly as pos-
sible. 
However, the earthquakes were not the only 
major 
challenge 
Peggy 
helped 
guide 
Ridgecrest through. This past year, she led 
the City through the ongoing coronavirus pan-
demic, working with the City Council and resi-
dents of the community to make sure that the 
City remained financially sound so it could 
continue operations, despite the economic 
downturn from various stay-at-home orders. 
Peggy also worked hard to ensure that nego-
tiations between the city and the U.S. Navy re-
mained on track to build a new wastewater 
treatment plant on NAWS China Lake to serve 
both the interests of the Navy and Ridgecrest. 
This project has seen its ups and downs over 
the years, but her steadfast commitment to it 
set the stage to help ensure it will come to fru-
ition. 
While her achievements as Mayor may have 
made headlines, Peggy’s tenure as Mayor is 
best defined by the everyday interactions she 
has with the people of Ridgecrest. Through 
devastating earthquakes and a rapidly spread-
ing virus, to working to address sustainable 
groundwater policies and supporting the mu-
tual interests of China Lake and Ridgecrest, 
Ridgecrest residents have always been able to 
count on Peggy to have their back. 
It has been an honor to work alongside 
Mayor Peggy Breeden over the past six years 
while 
she 
served 
in 
elected 
office 
for 
Ridgecrest, and I am proud to count her as a 
friend. I cannot thank her enough for her work 
in our community over the years. On behalf of 
the Ridgecrest community and the 23rd Con-
gressional District, I want to wish her the best 
as she leaves public service and begins the 
next chapter of her life.

HONORING SARA BONNEY AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, this week, 
many of us took the opportunity to observe 
Giving Tuesday by contributing to nonprofit or-
ganizations that support those in need and 
help us build a better community. 
Since 2012, Giving Tuesday has stood as a 
reminder to each of us to do good and to give 
what we can to help others in more need than 
ourselves. I rise today to ask the House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring an ex-
ceptional Iowan who exemplifies the charitable 
spirit of the people in central and southwest 
Iowa. Sara Bonney is the Chief Marketing Offi-
cer at the Community Foundation of Greater 
Des Moines. Over the last 7 years, Sara has 
done incredible work to promote the mission 
of the Community Foundation and make 
meaningful connections between donors and 
nonprofit organizations in the Des Moines 
area. 
Like many Iowans, Sara grew up on a farm 
in rural Iowa. Her parents were active mem-
bers in their community, constantly finding 
ways to give back and volunteer their time. 
Sara’s parents believed everybody has their 
own gifts—and that it is their responsibility to 
use those gifts for giving back to others. This 
is a value that Sara has carried with her and 
inspired her to pursue a career in nonprofit 
work and charitable giving, 
The Community Foundation of Great Des 
Moines has worked with donors and nonprofits 
in the Des Moines metro area for over 50 
years. The Community Foundation has estab-
lished countless giving funds and grants to 
support projects and organizations which have 
addressed their critical needs—spanning from 
education, fine arts, immigration and health 
care amongst so many others. 
Over the last year, Sara and her team iden-
tified an opportunity to make it easier for do-
nors and nonprofits to connect in a way that 
would produce more impactful contributions. 
That 
led 
to 
revamping 
their 
website 
givedsm.org. This website works with non-
profits to list their specific needs. In turn, do-
nors can access their lists. find organizations 
that align with their values, and make contribu-
tions that will have greater impacts on the re-
cipients. 
Givedsm.org is just one of the many 
projects Sara has worked on in the last 7 
years. When asked what inspires her to con-
tinue doing her work, Sara cites her amaze-
ment at the charitable nature of Iowans. Over 
the last year, thousands of Iowans have faced 
extreme hardships due to coronavirus. One 
might think this would negatively impact the 
number 
of 
contributions 
received 
on 
givedsm.org. However, the Community Foun-
dation has seen an exponential increase in the 
number of donations they have received 
through the website. 
As Sara likes to say: when Iowans rise, we 
rise together. 
Sara’s extraordinary commitment to sup-
porting nonprofits in our community has 
widereaching impacts on people in all walks of 
life. A lifelong Iowan, Sara hopes her work 
continues to make Iowa a better home for 
generations to come. 
We are incredibly fortunate to have people 
like Sara in Iowa’s Third District. It is my honor 
to recognize her as our Iowan of the Week.

HONORING THE CAREER OF RON 
LOMBARD 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the distinguished career of Ron Lom-
bard, as he retires after nearly 40 years in 
Central New York news. 
Ron is giant in local media. A key player in 
developing the region’s first 24-hour news sta-
tion, he helped revolutionize the way Central 
New Yorkers get their news, and throughout 
his career has inspired and mentored some of 
the region’s most celebrated reporters and 
media professionals. 
Ron Lombard grew up in Central New York 
and graduated from Solvay High School be-
fore going on to study at Syracuse University’s 
Newhouse School of Public Communications. 
After graduating in 1981, he began his career 
working as a reporter for WCBA in Corning, 
and in Central New York at WFBL, WSEN, 
and WSYR. Eventually, Ron secured a posi-
tion at WSYR as the Assignment Editor, and 
later, at the age of 31, began working at 
WIXT–TV as the News Director. 
In 2002, Ron took over as News Director at 
Time Warner Cable as the company em-
barked on an ambitious project: launching a 
24–hour news channel in Syracuse. Ron was 
instrumental in the development and direction 
of the station, working long hours to make this 
dream a reality. In 2003, in recognition of this 
work, Ron was given the honor of pushing the 
button to bring the new station to air. Since its 
debut, Time Warner Cable, now Spectrum 
News, has become one of the most trusted 
and reliable sources of news for Central New 
York, providing around-the-clock coverage to a 
market that has more than 600,000 sub-
scribers. Under his leadership, Ron guided the 
news team through periods of rapid growth 
and change, all while upholding the station’s 
commitment to accuracy. Ron oversaw and 
helped professionally support a staff of over 
70 photographers, reporters, assignment desk 
editors, and producers. 
Outside of work, Ron is dedicating to giving 
back to his hometown. He is deeply involved 
with the Brewerton United Methodist Church, 
and for many years served on the boards of 
Leadership Greater Syracuse and the McMa-
hon Ryan Child Advocacy Center, which sup-
ports children who have suffered from abuse. 
He is a proud husband to his wife Deb and fa-
ther to his daughter, Abby. 
At Spectrum News and throughout his ca-
reer, Ron has been known for his outstanding 
work ethic, impeccable reputation, and com-
mitment to mentoring the next generation of 
reporters and media professionals. His impact 
is far-reaching and will be celebrated for years 
to come. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in recognizing the distin-
guished career of Ron Lombard. A revolu-
tionary figure in Central New York news, I 
wish Ron Lombard the best in his retirement.

entrepreneur, Coral. I recently had the pleas-
ure of touring Coral’s Corner, where I wit-
nessed the hard work that Coral puts into 
growing and selling her products while bal-
ancing her academic responsibilities. Through 
collection and recycling of gardening products, 
partnerships with other local vendors, and cus-
tomer-appreciation events, Coral has estab-
lished her business as a generous and com-
passionate figure in the community. Coral’s 
Corner has been in business for just over a 
year and has expanded to an additional loca-
tion in response to strong community interest. 
Businesses like Coral’s Corner are vital to 
the economic livelihood of the North Country. 
Entrepreneurship drives job growth and sus-
tainability and creates the opportunity for indi-
viduals to turn passions into careers. Coral’s 
drive to pursue her passion from a young age 
makes her a tremendous role model for both 
her peers and adults. Her commitment to 
growing and selling quality products while also 
giving back to her community reflects exem-
plary professionalism and maturity. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I 
would like to thank Coral for her entrepre-
neurial spirit and dedication to her community, 
and I congratulate Coral’s Corner and Cones 
on a successful first year in business.

TRIBUTE TO S.R. ‘‘AL’’ LOPEZ 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to and congratulate Director S.R. 
‘‘Al’’ Lopez for his nearly two decades of dedi-
cated service to Western Municipal Water Dis-
trict (Western). I have had the pleasure of 
knowing Al for decades, and while his service 
on the Western Board is coming to a close 
this month, I know he will continue to be a 
leader in our community. 
After serving as a Council Member on the 
Corona City Council from 1982 to 1994, Al 
was first elected and joined Western’s Board 
of Directors in January of 2001. He represents 
Division 5, which includes my hometown of 
Corona, Home Gardens, El Cerrito, and a por-
tion of Temescal Canyon. 
Al has been an active community partner 
throughout his service on the board. He rep-
resented Western on committees for several 
agencies, including the Western Riverside 
County Regional Wastewater Authority; the 
Temescal Valley Municipal Advisory Council; 
and the Association of California Water Agen-
cies Joint Powers Insurance Authority Liability 
Committee. In addition, Al served as West-
ern’s alternate representative for the Santa 
Rosa Regional Resources Authority Com-
mittee and the Joint Inland-Orange County 
Caucuses. His leadership in the region in-
cludes membership on Western’s Finance 
Committee and his roles on the joint commit-
tees of Western and Elsinore Valley Municipal 
Water Districts. 
Al is a great American, a veteran, a true 
public servant, and a friend. I want to join our 
entire region in thanking Al for his many years 
of dedicated service and I wish him the very 
best in his next chapter. 
CELEBRATING LIEUTENANT COLO-

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize American patriot 
Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Patrick Josh Baker 
on the occasion of his retirement from the 
Army. America is more secure thanks to LTC 
Baker’s dedicated service, Alabama’s 5th Dis-
trict is proud of LTC Baker, and I extend my

naissance Battalion (ARB). 
In 2003, LTC Baker was deployed to sup-
port Operation Iraqi Freedom 1 (OIF) as a Pla-
toon Leader and Liaison Officer. Upon re-de-
ployment from OIF 1, he attended the Army 
Aviation Captain’s Career Course and Mainte-
nance Managers program. Later, in OIF 06– 
08, LTC Baker served as the Company Com-
mander in the C/1–227th and D/1–227th ARB.

ily the very best as he ends his twenty-one 
years of service in the U.S. Army.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EMER-
GENCY NURSES ASSOCIATION 
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the 50th anniversary of 
the Emergency Nurses Association. Com-
prised of 51,000 members worldwide, the 
Emergency Nurses Association, or ENA, is the 
only professional organization dedicated to ad-
vancing excellence in emergency nursing. 
Founded in 1970, ENA has become the 
world’s premier organization for emergency 
nurses. It was originally established to set 
standards for best practices in emergency 
nursing care and has since worked to provide 
both continuing education programs and a 
representative voice for emergency nurses. 
ENA has successfully raised awareness and 
improved outcomes for our nation’s trauma 
patients. Sadly, traumatic injuries such as 
head injuries, bums, and those resulting from 
car crashes, falls, and firearms are currently 
the leading cause of death for Americans 
aged 44 years or younger. ENA offers courses 
for emergency nurses that provide them with 
the knowledge, skills, and hands-on training 
needed to deliver high-quality trauma care. 
Since its inception in 1986, ENA’s critical trau-
ma nursing core course has been taken by 
more than one million emergency nurses and 
is now considered the gold standard for the 
education of nurses in lifesaving trauma care 
techniques. 
ENA’s advocacy for the recently enacted 
Military Injury Surgical Systems Integrated 
Operationally Nationwide to Achieve ZERO 
Preventable Deaths Act, known as the MIS-
SION ZERO Act, has led to the creation of an 
innovative program allowing military trauma 
teams and professionals to work in civilian 
trauma centers to ensure the highest quality 
trauma care in both peace and war. 
Last but certainly not least, ENA also effec-
tively raises awareness about workplace vio-
lence directed towards emergency nurses and 
other emergency department personnel. It has 
advocated at both the State and Federal level 
to enact laws that hold those who assault 
healthcare workers in hospitals accountable 
for their actions. 
As Co-Chair of the Congressional Nursing 
Caucus, I ask our colleagues to join me in 
congratulating the Emergency Nurses Asso-
ciation on its 50th anniversary and extending 
our gratitude to its members for their commit-
ment to improving the quality of emergency 
care which has helped save the lives of mil-
lions of Americans.

Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, to live to become 109 years old in

Such has been the life and legacy of Mrs. 
Rosie Atchison who was born on August 15th, 
1911 in Bolivar Mississippi and passed away 
on November 23rd, 2020. Her birth mother 
passed away when Rosie was just six weeks 
old and she was taken into the care of her fa-
ther Mr. Henry Liner who raised her as the 
2nd oldest of 27 children whom he fathered.

tired of the fields and a failed marriage, took 
her two children and migrated to Chicago 
looking for a better life and that is exactly what 
she found. With faith in God she joined Great-
er Salem Missionary Baptist Church where the 
renowned gospel singer Mahalia Jackson was 
a member and she also sang in the choir. She 
met and married her second husband Mr. An-
drew Atchison who worked for the Diamond 
Glue Factory. She found a job cleaning rail 
cars for the Pennsylvania Railroad and worked 
there until her retirement in 1970. 
Mrs. Atchison and her husband became 
very productive citizens and developed a rep-
utation for helping others less fortunate than 
themselves and she became known to many 
as big mama. Rosie and her family lived in the 
mecca building in the heart of the Bronzeville 
community until they were forced out to make 
room for the Illinois Institute of Technology. 
They protested and held marches around city 
hall but lost. After her husband died she pur-
chased a 2 flat building in the Englewood 
community and kept on helping people. 
On November 23, 2020, after 109 years 
Rosie passed away leaving 2 daughters, 15 
grandchildren, 60 great grandchildren, 95 
great great grandchildren and 24 great, great, 
great, great, grandchildren, one sister Jose-
phine Liner Wilson and a host of nieces, neph-

HONORING JOSH HURLBERT 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to thank Josh Hurlbert for his 
many meaningful years of service to the Sixth 
Congressional District of Missouri. 
Josh has been an invaluable member of my 
team in the Sixth Congressional District for 
twelve years. Getting his start as a volunteer 
for the office, Josh has worked his way 
through several positions on my staff. From 
Staff Assistant to Caseworker to Senior Field 
Representative—Josh is truly a jack of all 
trades. Josh also served the district in his role 
as Smithville Alderman. His untiring work ethic 
and vast knowledge of federal agencies and 
state issues alike have made him a crucial 
member of my staff. 
Josh’s dedication and leadership has not 
gone unnoticed by voters in Missouri. Upon 
leaving my staff, Josh will continue his service 
to the State of Missouri as a member of the 
Missouri House of Representatives. As the 
Representative for the Twelfth District, Josh 
will continue to honorably represent the resi-
dents of North Missouri and ensure that their 
voices are heard by the government. I look 
forward to working with him to continue to im-
prove the lives of our shared constituents. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in recognizing Josh Hurlbert for his com-
mitment to not just Missouri’s Sixth Congres-
sional District, but the entire state of Missouri. 
I am honored to have had him on my team for 
12 years and I am excited to see him continue 
as a leader in the Missouri House of Rep-
resentatives. 
EXPRESSING 
CONDOLENCES 
AND 
CELEBRATING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
CHARLEY FRANK PRIDE 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
it is with great sorrow that I acknowledge the 
passing of Charley Frank Pride, but with great 
joy that I recall his storied career as an artist, 
gifted musician and professional baseball play-
er, and with even greater joy that I recall our 
significant friendship. 
Charley Frank Pride was born in Sledge, 
Mississippi, on March 18, 1938. Charley’s par-
ents were both sharecroppers and cotton pick-
ers. Since he was young and couldn’t decide 
for himself what he could or couldn’t do, he 
was forced to pick cotton as a child. However, 
he grew up listening to country music. He 
walked around the house singing songs of 
Hank Williams and Roy Acuff. 
At the age of six, he found himself listening 
to the Grand Ole Opry on the country music 
radio station. At one time, Charley was given 
the nickname ‘‘Mocking Bird’’ by a neighbor 
who says Charley’s daily chores were to sing 
each morning and to play baseball. 
When Charley Pride was fourteen, he 
bought his first guitar from Sears and Roebuck 
and taught himself how to play by listening to 
different songs on the radio. Charley didn’t 
want to follow his father’s footsteps. His plan 
was to become famous in baseball, but his 
dream was to be a country singer. At the age 
of seventeen, he began to seek his fortune. 
In 1958, he played baseball in the American 
Negro League for the Birmingham Black Bar-
ons. But his baseball career didn’t last long. 
Charley stated ‘‘I’m not a black man singing 
white man music, I am an American singing 
American music. I worked out those problem 
years ago, and everybody else will have to 
work their way out of it too.’’ That was the end 
of Charley Pride’s baseball career. 
Later Charley had an audition for Jack 
Clement, a song writer and record producer. 
After the audition, Charley proved to Chet 
Atkins and the manager for the Mets that he 
wasn’t trying to fit in with the whites, he was 
just a business man singing American music. 
Chet Atkins, vice-president of RCA recording 
in Nashville, realized that Charley Pride’s 
country singing was a talent. This led Pride to 
a RCA recording contract. 
Two of his best and popular records are 
Snakes Crawl at Night, and Just Between You 
and Me, which earned a Grammy in 1968. 
Pride’s first number one hit on the singles 
chart was (‘‘All I Have to Offer You Is Me’’ in 
1964. ‘‘Kiss an Angel Good Morning’’ was a 
million-selling crossover single recorded in 
1971. Charley Pride has more than 36 number 
one country singles. He has produced more 
than 35 albums. 
On May 1, 1993, Pride joined the Grand Ole 
Opry. In 1994, the Academy Of Country Music 
presented him with its prestigious Pioneer 
Award. In 1994 his autobiography Pride: The 
Charley Pride Story was published by William 
Morrow. In 1996, he received a Trumpet 
Award by Turner Broadcasting, marking out-
standing African-American Achievement. 
His song ‘‘Roll On Mississippi’’ was consid-
ered as the official song of his home state, a 
stretch of Mississippi highway was named for 
him, and he performed a special Christmas 
performance for President and Mrs. Clinton at 
the White House. 
He was inducted into the Country Music Hall 
of Fame in 2000. In 2008 Charley Pride’s tal-
ent earned him the state of Mississippi’s top 
arts award for Lifetime Achievement in the 
2008 Governor’s Awards for Excellence in the 
Arts. 
Madam Speaker, on Saturday, December 
12, 2020 Texas and this Nation has lost the 
presence of one of its most humble and tal-
ented individuals on many fronts in American 
life. Charley’s loss will be deeply felt among 
many, but his work will not. His caring nature, 
his artistic work and for me more importantly, 
his friendship will live forever.

RECOGNIZING ETERNAL LIGHT 
FOOD PANTRY 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Eternal Light Food Pantry, an 
organization based in Dearborn Heights, 
Michigan that serves residents through food 
assistance to the families of Wayne County. 
Founder, Sam Bazzi, was moved and in-
spired by the hardship facing many working 
families and other vulnerable populations in 
our district. He started the Eternal Light food 
pantry to assist community members strug-
gling with food apartheid. He and his team of 
volunteers have served countless residents, 
including forty-two thousand people in 2020 
alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Through the community connections created 
by delivering meals and food baskets, Mr. 
Bazzi has gone above and beyond, referring 
those in need to social services organizations, 
and even helping to raise funeral funds for an-
other individual. Mr. Bazzi’s commitment to 
community and service are unparalleled and 
truly a reflection of how the 13th Congres-
sional District has continued to show up for 
each other during these difficult times. I am 
truly grateful for the work of Sam Bazzi and 
Eternal Light for answering the call to service 
and helping those who are in need the most. 
Please join me in tribute to Eternal Light 
Food Pantry, for its outstanding service to the 
people of Michigan’s 13th District.

Iowa Department of Transportation and at-
tended a training program at Iowa State Uni-
versity. He moved to California in 1962 work-
ing as a lunch truck driver at Orange County 
Food Service. In the summer of 1963, LeRoy 
met the love of his life, Sylvia. They became 
engaged soon after and were married in Au-
gust of 1964. Once married, LeRoy and Sylvia 
settled in my hometown of Corona, California. 
In 1974, LeRoy and Sylvia purchased the 
Park N’ Eat Drive In from Sylvia’s mother, 
Anna Ensley. In 1984 after outgrowing their 
6th Street location they moved to a larger lo-
cation on Industrial Way in Corona. The busi-
ness soon grew to over 65 lunch trucks. To-
gether, LeRoy and Sylvia owned and operated 
Park N’ Eat Industrial Catering for 39 years in 
Corona. In addition to being a successful busi-
nessman, LeRoy was a well-known and re-
spected fundraiser for many community orga-
nizations within Corona. LeRoy truly had a 
servant’s heart and devoted much of his time 
to helping the community, but his two favorite 
groups were the Corona Elks and Corona 
Host Lions. 
In addition to his wife, Sylvia, LeRoy is sur-
vived by his children: Deanna (Dean), Robert 
(Rebecca), Jennifer (Eric), six grandchildren, 
and one great-grandchild. He is also survived 
by six younger brothers and sisters. I extend 
my heartfelt condolences to the Fleming fam-
ily, his friends, and everyone fortunate enough 
to know LeRoy. Although LeRoy may be gone, 
the many contributions he made to his com-
munity and family will have a lasting impact.

PROBLEM WITH OUR PRISONS 
HON. KWANZA HALL 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
draw attention to the problem with our prisons. 
Earlier today I included in the RECORD a 
hyperlink to an article from Reuters. The arti-
cle draws attention to private prisons, the 
death penalty, and Covid. These are long-
standing scourges in our criminal justice sys-
tem. Also on that list of problems but not men-
tioned in that article are life sentences, the 
federal sentencing guidelines, and solitary 
confinement. 
I had supplemented to my earlier statement, 
and to the article, an appropriations proposal 
that, were I here during the appropriations 
process, I would have submitted so that it may 
be integrated into future appropriations vehi-
cles. I submitted this article, along with trou-
bling Georgia statistics. 
I would also note that I am submitting this 
statement and article on the same day that I 
introduced three pieces of legislation: 
The first will seek to eliminate qualified im-
munity in police misconduct cases. Often 
times, police officers, when confronted with al-
legations of official misconduct, will invoke 
qualified immunity as a shield to liability. It is 
very difficult for putative plaintiffs/victims of po-
lice misconduct to surmount this privilege. This 
bill, if enacted into law, would end qualified im-
munity throughout the nation and make it easi-
er to hold police accountable. 
The second piece of legislation is a constitu-
tional amendment, and concerns forced labor. 
The Thirteenth Amendment ended slavery. 
Unfortunately, a vestige of this practice still re-
mains in the form of forced labor as a function 
of prison sentences. This proposed constitu-
tional amendment would end this practice. 
These pieces of legislation are fully drafted 
and ready for filing. 
The third piece of legislation is one which 
would expunge all records of nonviolent of-
fenders impacted by the ‘‘war on drugs’’ and 
other various crime bills for any state and local 
government that is the recipient of federal 
crime dollars.

dream, fortitude, drive, work ethic, humor, and 
full enjoyment of all this life offered. 
James Berry Craddock was born on Janu-
ary 12, 1935 in Pueblo, Colorado. When Berry 
was five years old, he skinned his knee play-
ing outside and developed Osteomyelitis, but 
was saved by a new drug at the time, peni-
cillin. Despite having to learn to walk again, 
Mr. Craddock never let his disability define or 
hinder him in any way. He was known as a 
risk-taker and an accomplished skier, racing 
the slalom and the downhill. Berry even re-
ceived his first appearance in the local paper 
for rafting down the Royal Gorge on a one- 
man raft. 
Berry graduated from Canon City High 
School and attended the University of Colo-
rado, graduating in Civil Engineering and Busi-
ness Management. After college, he worked 
designing warehouses at Welbourne Construc-
tion Company. It was at Welbourne Construc-
tion where Berry pioneered twin tee construc-
tion and designed what would become known 
throughout Colorado and New Mexico as ‘‘The 
Craddock Building’’. 
On June 24, 1967, Berry married his wife, 
Linda, of 52 years. Soon after their marriage, 
Berry and Linda moved to Colorado Springs 
where they raised their sons, Matthew, James, 
and Michael. Mr. Craddock was known as a 
family man and he frequently stated that his 
biggest legacy was his three sons. He was 
fiercely proud of them and their accomplish-
ments, their families, and their character. 
It was also in Colorado Springs where Berry 
brought his vision to life and started Craddock 
Development Company. With only $5,000 to 
his name and help from his business partners, 
Berry built a real estate empire that lasts to 
this day. Berry was a fierce advocate of the 
Pikes Peak Region and constructed over 300 
buildings in his career, from hotels, to res-
taurants, warehouses, offices, and self-storage 
facilities. 
In his free time, Berry loved the outdoors, 
golf, fishing, and entertaining friends and fam-
ily at Lake Uneva. Berry cherished his hunts 
with his band of brothers at the Sanborn 
Ranch Duck Club and his annual pheasant 
hunt in South Dakota. Berry was an active 
member of the Broadmoor Golf Club, the El 
Paso Club, the Garden of the Gods Club, and 
the Vail Valley Foundation. It was in Vail 
where he developed lasting friendships with 
former President Gerald Ford, Senator Jack 
Kemp, and Clint Eastwood. 
Today, on behalf of Colorado’s 5th Congres-
sional District, we celebrate Mr. Craddock’s 
impactful life and legacy, he was truly one of 
a kind. May it be of comfort to his family and 
friends that we all pray for them during this 
sad time. May Mr. James Berry Craddock rest 
in peace.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
KAREN 
KLOTZ’S 
PUBLIC 
SERVICE 
TO 
VIRGINIA’S FIRST DISTRICT 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Karen Klotz’s dedicated 
public service to Virginia’s First Congressional 
District. After over six years of her crucial and 
impactful work with my office, Karen will be 
leaving my Stafford District Office at the end 
of the month. Karen has been a crucial mem-
ber of the team and of service Virginia’s First 
Congressional District, and she will be missed. 
Karen has always been available to help a 
constituent in need regardless of the issue. 
There has never been a case too difficult that 
Karen was unable to handle. Karen especially 
enjoyed researching and solving the more un-
usual and complicated cases. She has an un-
paralleled knowledge of the intricacies of navi-
gating federal agencies. She is a thoughtful 
and compassionate person whose resourceful-
ness has been an asset to this office. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you rise with me 
to recognize Karen Klotz and her years of 
dedicated work for the constituents in Vir-
ginia’s First District. Karen exemplifies what a 
true public servant should be, and I wish her 
the best of luck in her future career and jour-
ney.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF OFFICER THOMAS PYRCZ 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mourn the passing of a remarkable 
person and protector of the people, Officer 
Thomas ‘‘Tommy’’ Pyrcz of Enfield, Con-
necticut. Officer Pyrcz was only 66 when he 
passed away suddenly on December 2nd, 
2020 at the Enfield Police Department, an in-
stitution he served in one capacity or another 
for 50 years. He was a lifelong resident of the 
town of Enfield, Connecticut. 
It is hard to think of a man more devoted to 
their local community than Tommy Pyrcz. Al-
ways true to his town, drawn to public safety,

he took the initiative to join the Enfield chapter 
of Police Explorers before even graduating 
from Enrico Fermi High School in 1972. He 
was regularly and rightfully rewarded for his 
devoted service after graduating—first becom-
ing an auxiliary officer, then an assistant dog 
warden, and police dispatcher. Each and 
every one of these positions ultimately pre-
pared him to join the force as a full patrol offi-
cer in 1979. 
Thomas Pyrcz’s career at his town’s police 
department would continue on for another 40 
years. During those 40 years, he went on to 
serve as a leader of the police department’s 
accreditation team for 20 years, working with 
his colleagues to hone their skills and build 
upon the mission of strengthening the stand-
ards exemplified by the Enfield Police Depart-
ment and its officers. This work not only in-
fused new techniques and technology to im-
prove public safety, but also infused the com-
munity values that reflect the town of Enfield. 
The high quality of his work was recognized 
across the state when he was named Vice 
President of the Connecticut Police Accredita-
tion Coalition in 2013, advancing standards in 
policing across the state. After a long career 
spanning 50 years, he retired from the depart-
ment in August of last year. 
Officer Pyrcz service to his community did 
not end with retirement. After ‘‘pulling the pin’’ 
from uniformed service, he quickly returned to 
his work as a civilian accreditation manager in 
October 2019. His sudden loss leaves a deep-
ly felt void at the Enfield Police Department. 
Madam Speaker, Thomas Pyrcz represents 
what it should mean to be a police officer: an 
integral member of one’s community. At a fu-
neral service at Enfield’s St. Adalbert’s Church 
family, friends and former colleagues such as 
former Chief Carl Sferrazza and current Chief 
Alaric Fox spoke movingly of his life of caring 
and giving. His life should be an example to 
all. Madam Speaker, please join me in ex-
pressing the deepest condolences of the U.S. 
House of Representatives to Officer Thomas 
Pyrcz’s wife Lynn, his children Steven and 
Julie and our hope that the outpouring of af-
fection and appreciation from the community 
gives them some solace.

TRIBUTE TO MR. LEE RAYBURN 
PIONEER WESTSIDE OF CHICAGO 
BUSINESS 
AND 
COMMUNITY 
LEADER 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, the Almighty God has called to his 
eternal rest Mr. Lee Rayburn, a skilled me-
chanic and business leader who became a 
legend on the westside of Chicago in the auto-
mobile repair business. I met Mr. Rayburn in 
the late 1960’s when one of my staffer Ms. Ar-
lene Granderson introduced me to Mr. Nate 
Irwin who was her mechanic and was working 
at Rayburns Automobile Repair Shop at Roo-
sevelt and Independence. Mr. Irwin became 
my mechanic and my friend as did his boss, 
Mr. Rayburn. For more than fifty years Mr. 
Rayburn and his mechanics repaired my cars, 
fixed my flats, and preformed tow services, 
whenever I needed them. I soon learned that 
Mr. Rayburn was not only good at repairing 
cars, but was also interested in community 
politics, social service activities and was a 
great financial supporter of community causes. 
He, Garfield Major, Willie Barney, The Knox 
Family at the hardware store, Cliff Duwel 
White, Walker Harris the iceman, Dave at the 
hot dog stand and Rev. Murphy at Rose of 
Sharon Cleaners became the heart of busi-
ness support group in the area. Mr. Rayburn 
loved his business and loved the Lawndale 
Community. After he was no longer actively 
working, he would come up to the shop and 
sit around talking with customers and giving 
people advice. He was a great mechanic, a 
great businessman, a great family man, a 
great community leader, and he will be greatly 
missed.

TRIBUTE TO VIVIAN SPADY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is an honor 
to recognize one of the finest community lead-
ers in New York’s Sixteenth Congressional 
District, Vivian Spady. 
Vivian Spady has lived in New Rochelle her 
entire life; her family’s roots in the area run 
deep. As a mother, grandmother, and commu-
nity activist, Vivian has been providing oppor-
tunities to meet the needs of those around her 
for decades. In 2012, her long-standing vision 
took shape when she launched her non-profit 
organization—Big Viv’s Foundation. It started 
with a successful Christmas toy drive. Ever 
since, she has worked hard to provide neces-
sities and a sense of community to those who 
are most in need. In addition to Christmas toy 
drives, her annual events include Thanks-
giving turkey drives, Easter egg hunts, winter 
clothing drives for the homeless and a Moth-
er’s Day brunch for seniors. Vivian’s events 
have been show-cased in local media, most 
recently in Lohud, the Westchester/Rockland 
news. 
Bringing children opportunities to learn and 
grow is one of Vivian’s biggest joys. With her 
resourcefulness and drive, dozens of youth 
have attended shows and events including the 
Monster Jam Auto Show, Liberty and Knicks 
basketball games, and trips to the New York 
State capital. Focusing on young women, Viv-
ian has developed a girl’s night out program to 
foster a sense of security and fun while focus-
ing on health and hygiene. Vivian has em-
bodied the principle of teaching youth by 
sending children to Iona Prep summer camp 
and the habitat for humanity builder’s camp. 
The horrific coronavirus pandemic has not 
stopped Vivian, she held numerous outdoor 
events during the summer and fall for New 
Rochelle children, distributed over 100 turkeys 
for Thanksgiving and is continuing with her an-
nual toy drive. No matter what happens, Viv-
ian is unstoppable, she has persevered 
through recovery from pancreatic cancer to 
this year, hospitalization for coronavirus. 
Madam Speaker, Vivian Spady embodies 
the best of what we, as Americans, can be. I 
am proud to know her and to have served her 
in Congress. Her work continues and the re-
sults of her unwavering commitment will ben-
efit generations of New Rochelle residents. 
TRIBUTE TO JASON SCOTT 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to my good friend 
Jason Scott, who will be stepping down from 
the Corona City Council this month after serv-
ing the city for twelve years. Jason is the em-
bodiment of a public servant, who has made 
an invaluable lifetime contribution to my home-
town of Corona, California. 
Throughout his life, Jason has dedicated 
himself to educating the next generation of 
Riverside County citizens. In a career that 
spanned four decades, from 1979 to 2019, 
Jason worked as a teacher and principal for 
the Corona-Norco Unified School District. In 
2008, Jason was elected to the Corona City 
Council, where he would be selected on three 
occasions by his peers to serve as mayor. 
During his time on the City Council, Jason 
was chosen to represent the city on the West-
ern Riverside Council of Governments Board 
of Directors. Corona experienced significant 
growth during Jason’s tenure, and his leader-
ship and experience helped the city tackle a 
number of challenges and seize opportunities 
presented by that expansion. 
Jason has worked tirelessly through his 
deeds to causes other than his own. He has 
long been an active member of many commu-
nity organizations in the city of Corona and 
has served as a Board Member for the 
Friends of the Corona Public Library, United 
Way, UNITY, and Corona Fire Safety Founda-
tion. He is a member of the Corona Elks, Co-
rona History Association, Corona-Norco PTA, 
and the Corona Historic Preservation Society. 
Jason shared his life for 30 years with his wife 
Dee until her passing in February 2017 of 
pancreatic cancer following a two-year battle. 
During and after that incredibly difficult period, 
I was truly inspired by Jason’s strength and 
will to keep working and advocating for others. 
I know I speak on behalf of all residents in 
expressing my heartfelt thanks and praise for 
Jason’s significant contributions to the City of 
Corona. I look forward to seeing Jason around 
town, and I wish him the very best in the fu-
ture.

In 1958, Mr. Reale was hired as a radar an-
tenna designer by General Electric. An inno-
vator by nature, Mr. Reale holds four U.S. pat-
ents and one international patent for his radar 
antenna designs. He designed the PAR radar 
antenna, which revolutionized radar antenna 
design, and the PAR radar, which became the 
largest radar instillation in the world. Later in 
his career, Mr. Reale designed the antenna for 
the Over-the-Horizon radar, which is currently 
the largest radar in the world. Today, many of 
Mr. Reale’s designs are still in use, serving to 
detect and track ballistic missiles and protect 
our nation against foreign threats. 
Outside of his career, Mr. Reale was an ac-
tive member of his community. After retiring, 
he began a weekly luncheon club for retired 
engineers. He thoroughly enjoyed playing 
handball, golf, and tennis, and was an active 
member of Our Lady of Pompei Church and 
the Men’s Holy Name Society. Mr. Reale was 
a loving husband to his wife, Jeanette, and 
role-model to his five children and eight grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House to join me in recognizing Mr. John 
Reale, Sr. A cherished member of our Central 
New York community, Mr. Reale will be deeply 
missed. I ask my colleagues to keep him and 
his family in mind as we celebrate his life.
