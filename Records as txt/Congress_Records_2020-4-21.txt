home, to bring comfort and assistance 
in their districts as they are able to do.

Please inspire the governors in this

f 
APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
The legislative clerk read the fol-
lowing letter: 
U.S. SENATE,

f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent to be recognized, notwith-
standing the order for a pro forma ses-
sion today. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection?

f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT 
AGREEMENT—H.R. 6322 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I

dered. 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, ear-
lier today, leaders in both Chambers 
and the administration reached a bi-
partisan agreement to supplement the 
historic CARES Act. At the core of our 
agreement is $320 billion more for the 
Paycheck Protection Program, which 
is already saving millions of small 
business jobs and helping Americans 
get paychecks instead of pink slips. 
This is even more money than we had 
first requested a while back. In the in-
tervening time and at our request, this 
new money puts a special focus on 
community banks and credit unions. 
Separately, thanks to the hard work 
of Senator COLLINS and Senator RUBIO, 
the bill supplies $60 billion for addi-
tional economic injury disaster loans; 
and because of Senator ROBERTS, Sen-
ator DAINES, and our other colleagues 
from rural States, it will be clear that 
farmers and ranchers will be eligible as 
well. 
Senate 
Republicans 
wanted 
more 
funding 
for 
Americans’ 
paychecks 
nearly 2 weeks ago before the program 
even shut down, but in the days that 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
delayed 
these urgent funds, additional Federal 
help for hospitals, healthcare pro-
viders, and testing became timely as 
well. Republicans have always sup-
ported more medical funding as soon as 
it was necessary, so I am proud this 
package will provide roughly $75 bil-
lion 
more 
to 
fund 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare providers in this crisis. 
Thanks to Chairman ALEXANDER and 
Chairman BLUNT, there is an additional 
$25 billion for State-led—State-led— 
COVID–19 testing plans and for re-
search, development, and other testing 
support for key Federal agencies, such 
as the CDC, the NIH, and BARDA. 
This is a significant package. It does 
just what I outlined the evening we 
passed the CARES Act back in March. 
The Senate is continuing to stand by 
the American people, watching the 
CARES Act go into effect, and adding 
funding when necessary to key pro-
grams that are working well. It is un-
fortunate that it took our Democratic 
colleagues 12 days to agree to a deal 
that contains essentially nothing that 
Republicans ever opposed. In my view, 
it is indefensible that Main Street 
small businesses and their workers had 
their assistance cut off for partisan le-
verage. That was the word of choice for 
one leading House Democrat: ‘‘Lever-
age.’’ The American people cannot be 
political leverage. 
I am glad we are now poised to move 
ahead. Senate Republicans are pre-
pared to pass the bill. It is my hope the 
entire Senate will be able to pass it as 
soon as possible, potentially as soon as 
just a few minutes from now. 
Before I conclude, I want to share my 
gratitude for the people whose efforts 
allow us to produce these vital pieces 
of legislation on a crash timeline in 
these most unusual circumstances. A 
lot of talented people worked day and 
night to produce this bill: in the ad-
ministration, Secretary Mnuchin and 
his staff at the Treasury Department 
and White House Chief of Staff Mark 
Meadows; here in the Senate, our Mem-
bers on both sides, our committee and 
leadership staff on both sides, and the 
incredible team players in the Office of 
the Legislative Counsel—these are non-
partisan staff who serve the institution 
and our country. As usual, we literally 
would not have this legislative text 
without 
their 
extraordinary 
help. 
These are unprecedented times for the 
entire Nation, and the Senate is no ex-
ception. So I want to thank everyone— 
those who worked remotely from their 
kitchen tables, those of you here in the 
Chamber right now, the Capitol police 
officers who protect the place day and 
night—I thank you all, and more im-
portantly, your country thanks you. 
Now, let’s just get this done. Let’s 
move ahead and get it done for the 
American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2178 
April 21, 2020 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT 
AGREEMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent there now be 
up to 15 minutes of debate each for 
Senators SCHUMER, PAUL, CARDIN, LEE, 
and SULLIVAN; further, that the time be 
for debate only and upon the use or 
yielding back of their individual times, 
I be immediately recognized with no 
intervening action. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, 
in the month since I last addressed this 
Chamber, life for nearly every Amer-
ican has been upended. Stay-at-home 
orders have swept across the country. 
The monthly toll of new unemploy-
ment claims are measured in the mil-
lions. Our health system has been 
strained to the breaking point. Amer-
ican workers and businesses are suf-
fering financial hardship not seen since 
the Great Recession. Almost 800,000 of 
our fellow citizens have tested positive 
for 
COVID–19. 
And 
most 
heartbreakingly, 
America 
has 
lost 
more than 37,000 precious lives to this 
coronavirus—many, many of them New 
Yorkers. 
Over the past 2 months, the Senate 
has come together on three occasions 
to pass legislation in response to this 
multifaceted crisis, to rescue our ailing 
healthcare system, to cushion the blow 
to American workers and businesses, 
and to prepare our country for a more 
prosperous future on the other side of 
this pandemic. 
Our 
last 
legislative 
effort, 
the 
CARES Act, was unprecedented in size 
and in scope—the largest stimulus in 
American 
history. 
Remarkably, 
on 
such a large and complex bill, the Sen-
ate came together 96–0 to pass this cru-
cial emergency relief, getting ayes 
from Senator SANDERS to Senator CRUZ 
and everyone in between. It shows 
that, even with the partisanship here, 
as tough and harsh as it can be, we can 
come together unanimously in a time 
of great crisis. 
Still, the depth of the crisis we now 
face meant that funding for certain 
programs in this bill had already been 
depleted, and a number of required 
fixes had to be made to make sure 
these programs worked as intended. An 
interim bill, COVID 3.5, is necessary. 
Now, my friend, the Republican lead-
er, tried to bypass negotiations on such 
an interim measure. He tried to jam 
through a bill that would have in-
creased funding for one small business 
lending program but not others, when 
they were all running out of funding. 
His proposal did not attempt to fix the 
dire lack of lending to small businesses 
that are truly small, underbanked, un-
derserved, minority, or women-owned. 
His proposal included nothing at all for 
our healthcare system, nothing to ad-
dress the national shortage in testing, 
nothing to help State, local, or Tribal 
governments who are breaking their 
budgets to fight this disease. 
All of us want to help our small busi-
nesses—all of us—but this emergency 
demands we take action on many 
fronts. So we have spent the last week 
negotiating with the administration— 
Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Chief of 
Staff Meadows, as well as Speaker 
PELOSI and House Democrats with us, 
the Senate Democrats, to improve the 
legislation. We reached a final agree-
ment earlier today. 
Now, there are plenty of disagree-
ments between our parties these days, 
but once again, we are coming together 
to pass this legislation by unanimous 
consent—not a single Senator objected. 
I want to thank Secretary Mnuchin. 
I spent hours and hours with him at all 
hours of the day. I want to thank some-
one I didn’t know very well, Chief of 
Staff Meadows, who is very good at 
making sure an agreement can come to 
fruition, even in the wee hours of the 
morning. Of course, I want to thank 
my dear friend and partner, Speaker 
PELOSI. I want to thank Leaders 
MCCONNELL and MCCARTHY who, at the 
end of the day, did not let partisan dis-
agreement stand in the way of doing 
what is right for this country. 
Again, just like the CARES Act, the 
hard work of bipartisan negotiation 
paid off. The fact that Democrats said, 
You need to talk to us, not try to 
steamroll us, once again, made a huge 
and positive difference. This legislation 
is significantly better and broader than 
the initial proposal offered by the Re-
publican leader. 
Republicans asked us to funnel more 
money into a program that wasn’t 
working the way it should. We nego-
tiated a bill that not only provided 
support but made it more effective, 
more inclusive, and addressed other ur-
gent national priorities as well. The 
legislation before us contains 220 bil-
lion more dollars, including funding for 
small businesses through community 
financial institutions, new funding for 
our hospitals and healthcare systems, 
and a substantial downpayment on a 
national testing regime so desperately 
needed and asked for by one and all. 
Let me repeat that: The legislation 
now includes an additional $220 billion, 
$120 billion for small businesses, $100 
billion for our healthcare system, di-
vided among healthcare providers and 
a need for testing and contact tracing. 
The new money includes $50 billion in 
additional emergency small business 
loans and $10 billion in additional busi-
ness grants. That includes $60 billion in 
new funding set aside for small lenders. 
If you don’t know a banker, if you are 
not a relatively large-sized company, 
you were left out. Two out of three 
loans in New York were ignored. The 
mom-and-pops, the small businesses, 
the restaurants, and the barber shops, 
the hardware stores, the butchers, and 
small startups, both service and manu-
facturing, they couldn’t get in. Now, 
they will be because of our work. 
Our bill will help rural small busi-
nesses, 
minority 
small 
businesses, 
women-owned small businesses get the 
money they need. I believe every Mem-
ber of our Caucus heard from busi-
nesses in their States who couldn’t ac-
cess Federal lending because they 
didn’t have a prior relationship with a 
big bank. 
So what we have done is set aside 
lending for smaller, community-based 
lenders and dedicated half of that fund-
ing—$30 billion—to Community Devel-
opment Financial Institutions and Mi-
nority Depository Institutions. We in-
sisted that this money be separate 
from the competition with the bigger 
companies, so that moms-and-pops, 
restaurants and nail salons, startups, 
and minority businesses can get some 
access. 
Unlike Leader MCCONNELL’s proposal, 
this bill also includes $100 billion in 
money to fight the coronavirus itself. 
We are not going to cure the economic 
problem unless we cure the health 
problem. We can give loans to small 
businesses, but if there are no cus-
tomers walking the streets to go into 
their stores, what good is that? 
So we insisted that $75 billion go to 
our hospitals. Our hospitals are going 
underwater—certainly, the big ones in 
cities like mine that have an epicenter 
of corona, but smaller hospitals in 
rural areas. Talk to our rural rep-
resentatives, and they are telling you 
their hospitals might go under. And 
medium-sized hospitals in New York 
State—St. Joseph’s in Syracuse and St. 
Peter’s in Albany—each laid off 700 
people this week. They are going to get 
help because of what we did. 
The experts are clear. To fight this 
disease and reopen the economy safely, 
we 
need 
to 
dramatically—dramati-
cally—expand testing capacity and fre-
quency. We don’t have enough tests; 
that cry rings from one end of America 
to the other. It is urban, suburban, 
rural, north, east, south, and west; we 
don’t have enough tests. 
Well, now, help is on the way because 
Democrats stood and fought for it—$25 
billion, $11 billion to go to the States 
to help them test and do the contact 
tracing they need, money to help cre-
ate a manufacturing and supply chain 
that will have adequate tests and ade-
quate supplies for those tests so we can 
finally get them going. We need them 
desperately. 
One of the last provisions secured in 
these negotiations at midnight last 
night was a requirement that the ad-
ministration report on a national stra-
tegic testing plan on how it plans to in-
crease domestic testing capacity, test-
ing supplies, and the disparities in all 
communities. Thus far, unfortunately,

S2179 
April 21, 2020 
the administration has refused to ac-
cept responsibility for the sorry state 
of testing in our country. Under this 
agreement, the Trump administration 
will now, at last, be required to report 
on what its national testing plan actu-
ally looks like. Congress provided the 
startup funds for the testing program. 
It is now up to the administration to 
prepare a national testing strategy and 
implement those funds to proper effect 
before it is too late. 
Of course, this bill is not perfect. We 
are sorely disappointed Republicans re-
fused to work with us to strengthen 
food 
assistance. 
I 
am 
sorely 
dis-
appointed that Republicans turned a 
deaf ear to Governors, mayors, Tribal 
leaders, county and local officials, 
Democratic and Republican, all 50 Gov-
ernors who have been pleading with the 
Federal Government for more help. 
And it is not about abstract govern-
ment. I know we don’t like government 
on the other side of the aisle. It is 
about policemen, firefighters, bus driv-
ers, hospital workers. They are being 
laid off because the local governments 
and the State governments are starv-
ing and not getting their revenues. We 
fought and fought, but unfortunately, 
on the other side of the aisle, they re-
sisted. I hope they won’t resist in 
COVID 4. We are going to need a large, 
large amount of money to help our lo-
calities 
so 
those 
policemen, 
fire-
fighters, and bus drivers are not laid 
off. Republicans need to come to the 
table and work with us to give our 
States the help they need. They should 
be eager to do it. 
Secretary Mnuchin committed—and 
the President tweeted today—that they 
will support State and local funding in 
the next round of legislation, as well— 
and this is very important—as a provi-
sion providing flexibility to use all 
past and future relief dollars to offset 
lost revenue. The President signaled 
his support for this concept as well in 
a tweet this morning. We should have 
passed support for State and local gov-
ernments. Democrats will see to it that 
it gets done in the next package. 
Now, finally, I would remind my col-
leagues that this is an interim meas-
ure. There are plenty of hard-won pro-
visions that we Democrats are pleased 
with, but it is, ultimately, a building 
block. 
In the weeks ahead, Congress must 
prepare another major bill, similar in 
size and ambition to the CARES Act. 
The next bill must be big and bold and 
suited to the needs of a beleaguered 
country. State localities and Tribal 
governments need support, so does the 
Postal Service. Working Americans 
need rental assistance. Frontline work-
ers deserve hazard pay, and it is not 
just doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and 
other medical workers, but truck driv-
ers, grocery store clerks, police offi-
cers, firefighters, and more. 
We must make sure that our elec-
tions this fall are conducted fairly, 
that States have enough money to run 
them properly, and that every Amer-
ican can exercise his or her constitu-
tional franchise safely and confidently. 
This is a COVID-related issue. 
So those issues and more will be pri-
orities for the Senate Democratic Cau-
cus in the next bill. Yes, it has been a 
long few months for the American peo-
ple, but even now, there are signs that 
the sacrifices Americans have made are 
beginning to slow the spread of the dis-
ease. We are a long way from the end, 
but this, too, shall pass. 
Until the day when we can begin to 
return to normal, it is up to Congress 
and the entire Federal Government to 
deliver the leadership and resources 
that only we can provide. The private 
sector will not provide the aid our Na-
tion requires. The efforts of individual 
States or even individual citizens, he-
roic as they are, will not be enough. We 
dare not abandon them in these dark 
and difficult times. 
The American people need their gov-
ernment. They need their government 
to act strongly, boldly, wisely. Let us 
do what we were elected to do and pass 
this bill today. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Utah. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is with a 
heavy heart that I come to the floor of 
the Senate today. Over the last few 
weeks, I talked to countless people 
throughout Utah and across the Na-
tion, but especially in Utah, about the 
troubles that they have encountered, 
about the profound sadness that the 
American people are experiencing right 
now, the frustrations that they have. 
This is something that we have never 
seen in this country, not on this scale, 
not during our lifetimes. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to 
my fellow Americans and my fellow 
Utahns as they are struggling to make 
ends meet, whether it is figuring out 
how to make payroll or keep food on 
the table at home or a combination of 
both, as it is for so many. I am mindful 
of them and of all the difficulty that 
the American people are going through 
right now. 
I want to begin by echoing something 
that Senator SCHUMER said a moment 
ago. We need to do what we were elect-
ed to do. Now, I don’t agree with every-
thing Senator SCHUMER just said—in 
fact, I would strongly disagree with a 
lot of what he just said—but I do agree 
with that. We need to do the job we 
were elected to do. 
Let’s think about where we are right 
now and where we have been over the 
last 
few 
weeks. 
We 
have 
seen 
healthcare providers working 24 hours 
a day, 7 days a week. We have seen the 
President and his staff at the White 
House working 24 hours a day and 7 
days a week. We have seen the Centers 
for Disease Control and members of the 
public health community who have 
continued to work tirelessly—farmers, 
truck drivers, grocery store employees, 
and pharmacists working to make sure 
that we continue to have access to the 
things we need in order to live. We 
have seen members of the news media 
working overtime, even if, as is the 
case for many of them, they do so only 
to blame all of this—rather unfairly in 
my opinion—on the President of the 
United States. We have seen parents 
working 
both 
their 
jobs—both 
of 
them—from home and simultaneously 
home schooling their children; yet Con-
gress is in recess. This, Mr. President, 
is simply unacceptable. 
If COVID–19 requires Congress to act, 
then it requires Congress to convene. 
Now, look, I understand the need for 
distancing, and there are ways we can 
accommodate that here. Support staff 
can stay home. Policy experts can 
mostly work from home. Many of our 
meetings—most of them, in fact—can 
be conducted over the phone or by 
video conference. I have seen this my-
self in the last few weeks. I have been 
working as many hours as ever, just 
with a lot of meetings over the phone 
and through Zoom and platforms like 
that. 
The meetings can continue, but all 
the essential work of Congress—that is, 
any steps necessary in order to enact 
legislation, the task of legislating 
itself—can be done only by Members 
who are voting and present in their re-
spective legislative Chambers, either 
the Senate or the House of Representa-
tives. This is a nondelegable duty. We 
can’t delegate it to anyone else in gov-
ernment, and so we have got exactly 
two choices. We can choose to legis-
late, in which case we have to convene, 
or we can stay in recess and not legis-
late. Those really are the only two op-
tions. 
It is no coincidence, it is no accident 
that the very first clause of the very 
first section of the very first article of 
the Constitution says that ‘‘all legisla-
tive Powers herein granted shall be 
vested in the Congress of the United 
States, which shall consist of a Senate 
and a House of Representatives.’’ 
Article I, section 7 then goes on to 
prescribe the formula by which all Fed-
eral law will be enacted. This may hap-
pen only when the same discrete set of 
words presented in the form of a legis-
lative proposal passes the House and 
the Senate and is then submitted to 
the President for signature or veto. 
Under our constitutional system, 
under any definition of the term, Sen-
ators are essential employees. We are 
being paid. We have a crisis to continue 
to work through. Our services are nec-
essary. In order to perform those serv-
ices, we have to perform them here in 
Washington. 
To be very clear about this, this isn’t 
entirely a new thing. Sure, the most 
recent iteration of this is new and 
began when the COVID–19 crisis began 
about a month ago, but the fact is Con-
gress has, in many respects, been 
shirking its responsibilities for years— 
for decades, in fact. For the better part 
of the last—I don’t know—three, four,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2180 
April 21, 2020 
five, six decades, Congress has been 
sort of backing away from its law-
making responsibilities. We have ceded 
voluntarily—sometimes willfully—the 
responsibility for making law, in some 
cases, to the courts—in many, many 
cases to executive branch agencies. 
This, for many, is a feature, not a bug, 
but it is an unconstitutional feature. It 
is something we should dismiss and 
render a bug. You see, we can’t dele-
gate that power. It is supposed to be-
long only to us, and that means we are 
not supposed to enact law saying, Enti-
ty X, Y, or Z shall enact good law in 
the area of expertise of that agency. 
But in this crisis, we have doubled 
down on that decades-long bad habit. 
In many cases, within Congress itself, 
we have empowered party leaders to 
negotiate in secret, sort of asking us to 
rubberstamp 
out 
these 
take-it-or- 
leave-it proposals without individual 
Members being able to read them, let 
alone have meaningful input in their 
negotiation, and reducing the role of 
each individual elected lawmaker in 
the law-making process through a se-
ries of tweets and press conferences. 
This isn’t legislating. 
I was interested a few minutes ago 
when Senator Schumer was talking, as 
he was referring to provisions that 
were negotiated successfully just last 
night to add this or that provision into 
this deal. Well, most of us were not 
part of that process. Most of us saw 
this legislative package, this bill, only 
within the last few hours. That isn’t a 
true negotiation, and it is not a true 
legislative process. Now, I understand 
that we are in unusual circumstances, 
but we can’t let it happen this way 
again. This is not acceptable. We 
should not be passing major legisla-
tion—especially legislation providing 
nearly a half trillion dollars in new 
spending—without Congress actually 
being in session, without Members ac-
tually being here to debate, discuss, 
amend, and consider legislation and 
vote on it individually, rather than on 
an absentee basis, rather than by dele-
gating that power to someone else. 
This crisis is too big to leave up to a 
small handful of people. Different parts 
of the country will face different kinds 
of threats and, therefore, have different 
kinds of needs. Different industries will 
need different kinds of help in order to 
recover the health of the economy. As 
long as Congress remains in recess, 
Democrats are free to politicize and 
stifle legislation with impunity as they 
did just a couple of weeks ago. Only re-
turning to work and indeed actually 
working will give the American people 
the government they deserve. 
The American people need to know 
who is helping them and who is simply 
playing politics. We can’t allow them 
to know that if we are not in session. 
We can’t just spend another half tril-
lion dollars every week or 2 or 3 and 
hope and pretend that it is going to 
turn out okay. 
The upcoming challenges are far too 
numerous and onerous and complex to 
leave up to just a few staff meetings 
behind closed doors. We have got issues 
involving testing, masks, healthcare 
policy, liability, leave, regulatory re-
form, immigration, and the judicial 
system, just to name a few. All of these 
things require serious legislative ac-
tion. We can’t just give those issues 
the attention that they deserve simply 
by sitting in our respective homes. 
Now, look, I am not saying that 
Members aren’t working. I and most of 
the Members I know have been working 
as hard as ever in the last few weeks, 
but we can’t do that which is uniquely 
our job—sure, we can have meetings. 
We can make phone calls. We can help 
solve problems just like any other 
American could, but we cannot do the 
job for which we were elected without 
actually being here. 
You see, the reason Congress works 
so little, even in moments like this 
one, is because Congress has chosen to 
prioritize its own convenience. 
The 31⁄2-day legislative workweek, 
blocking tough amendment votes, nu-
clear options, things like this are all 
reminders of the fact that we have to 
get back to work, especially if we are 
going to have a debate about when ev-
eryone else will be able to return to 
work. If it makes anyone feel better, 
remember the Senate floor is often 
empty—just as it is at this very mo-
ment—making it perhaps the safest 
place in America. We can, in fact, 
structure our votes in such a way that 
we can distance ourselves. We have 
proven that in recent weeks. We can do 
it again. 
In closing, we have to remember that 
challenges 
don’t, 
themselves, 
build 
character. They reveal it. Our char-
acter is revealed rather than built on 
challenging times. The character of our 
institution is on the line here. It is 
being exposed and revealed for all the 
world to see. 
COVID–19 certainly has revealed to 
us the character of the Chinese Govern-
ment and its lackeys inside the World 
Health Organization. It has revealed 
the character of America’s doctors and 
nurses, our priests and our pastors. Our 
families and our communities have 
pulled together. Many State and local 
leaders have proven themselves to be 
up to the challenge, especially, I say 
with great pride, both Democrats and 
Republicans in my home State of Utah. 
Congress stepped up before we re-
cessed to appropriate money for work-
ers and businesses who were facing an 
unprecedented monumental crisis, but 
that was weeks ago. That was literally 
20 million lost jobs ago. There is more 
to do—there is a lot more to do—more 
than we have ever faced. The country 
is changing along with the rest of the 
world, and we need policy to change 
with it. 
Unlike millions of our constituents, 
Members of Congress are still receiving 
paychecks. It is time for us to earn 
them. It is time to do our job. It is 
time to return to Washington and get 
to work. We are not currently sched-
uled to come back until May 4. When 
we come back on May 4—which I hope 
we do—I hope the force will be with us, 
but we have got to get back together 
even sooner than that because we can’t 
legislate without our Members here. 
We can’t do that from recess. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am 
pleased that we are ready to act and we 
will be able to pass legislation in a few 
moments that will help deal with this 
pandemic. Like my colleagues, I have 
been in teleconferences with different 
groups in Maryland, and I have seen 
the pain caused by the coronavirus. In 
Maryland, we are losing around 30 citi-
zens every day to the coronavirus. Over 
the last week, our Nation has lost over 
15,000 to the coronavirus. This pan-
demic is with us in a very serious way, 
and we need to respond. 
I am pleased that, this afternoon, we 
will be providing additional resources 
to our healthcare providers, particu-
larly those that are on the frontlines, 
in dealing with the coronavirus and 
that we will be passing legislation to 
establish a national strategy on test-
ing, working with our States to make 
sure all communities have adequate 
testing so that, when we reopen our so-
ciety, we can do so in a safe manner. 
I am also pleased that we are acting 
on the small business provisions. The 
programs that we passed in the CARES 
Act that provide help to small busi-
nesses was very popular and was over-
subscribed. I am particularly pleased 
that we are able to pass today provi-
sions that are greatly improved from 
when I was last on the floor a little 
over 1 week ago when the majority 
leader made the unanimous consent re-
quest that would have included only 
additional money for the Paycheck 
Protection Program,—$250 billion—and 
would 
not 
have 
dealt 
with 
the 
healthcare issues or the challenges 
that I expressed on the floor at that 
time in regards to the small business 
provisions. The reason that we now 
have a bill that we can be very proud of 
is because this has been negotiated 
with all Members of the Senate being 
involved through a bipartisan process, 
rather than just being brought to the 
floor by the majority. 
We saw that happen on the CARES 
Act originally. The original bill that 
was brought to the floor by the major-
ity leader that he attempted to pass 
did not include major help for our 
State and local governments, did not 
include major help for our healthcare 
institutions, did not provide funds for 
many of our programs that are criti-
cally important to our local commu-
nities. We were able to improve that 
program because we worked together. 
Democrats and Republicans have pro-
duced a bill that we can be proud of. 
As I said when I was last on the floor 
in regards to the small business provi-
sions, we have a bipartisan process.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2181 
April 21, 2020 
Senator RUBIO and I have been working 
closely together to develop the tools 
for small businesses. Yes, I do acknowl-
edge the work with Senator COLLINS 
and Senator SHAHEEN because we have 
come together to try to put together a 
package that could work. 
What I had mentioned on the floor 
when the last UC was made was that 
there were problems with the original 
request made by the majority leader, 
and I pointed that out. Underserved 
communities have not been able to get 
in, in the same number as those larger 
small businesses who have relations 
with banking institutions. I pointed 
that out to the Secretary of the Treas-
ury and to the Small Business Admin-
istrator on April 7 by a letter I au-
thored along with Senator SCHUMER 
and the Democratic members of the 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship 
Committee. We pointed this out 2 days 
before we had the original UC request. 
Quoting from that letter to the Sec-
retary and the Administrator: 
We believe that more can be done to reach 
out to and authorize those lenders, such as 
Community Development Financial Institu-
tions, Minority Depository Institutions, and 
mission-based non-profit lenders, which are 
best positioned to bridge the trust gap be-
tween many underserved communities and 
the traditional financial sector. For exam-
ple, a survey conducted by the Association 
for Enterprise Opportunity found that more 
than half of Black respondents indicated 
they felt unfairly treated by financial insti-
tutions, compared to only 26 [percent] of 
White respondents. 
We knew we had to do something to 
bridge that gap. When the request was 
made 10 days ago, it did not include 
any help for these minority businesses 
or the rural areas or women-owned 
businesses that have been shut out in 
great numbers to the first requests 
under the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. 
What this bill that we now have on 
the floor does corrects that. It corrects 
that by providing $60 billion, in addi-
tion to the $250 billion. We are now up 
to $310 billion more going into the Pay-
check Protection Program; but $60 bil-
lion is dedicated to dealing with minor-
ity communities, rural communities, 
and women-owned businesses by having 
more funds going out to the commu-
nity banking institutions and minority 
banking institutions and mission-based 
nonprofit lenders so that we can get 
more of the funds into the hands of 
those small businesses that are in des-
perate need: the smaller small busi-
nesses. 
I have numerous examples. I will just 
use one, if I might, from a business in 
Maryland, e-End Frederick, that writes 
to us and says that thanks to this pro-
gram—this employer has 20 employees. 
This is a small business, 20 employees. 
What he says basically is: I was look-
ing to how I could transition my em-
ployees to unemployment because I 
couldn’t afford to continue to keep 
them on payroll, but now, thanks to 
the Paycheck Protection Program, I 
am able to keep my employees on the 
payroll. He says, ‘‘That’s the best thing 
about the PPP.’’ 
I couldn’t agree more. That is what 
we are trying to do. It is paycheck pro-
tection—keep workers employed so 
small businesses don’t have to go back 
out when this virus is over and try to 
find a workforce in order to be com-
petitive. They can keep their work-
force in place and, by the way, keeping 
the pressure off our unemployment 
compensation system. 
We were able, through the change we 
were able to make—and I applaud Sen-
ator SCHUMER and Speaker PELOSI for 
sticking to the principle that all small 
businesses needed to be included, and 
as a result, this package now includes 
these allocations that will get to our 
minority 
and 
underserved 
commu-
nities. 
There is a second issue I raised on 
the floor 10 days ago, and that is the 
Economic Injury Disaster Loans, the 
EIDL loans. It ran out of money before 
the PPP program ran out of money. It 
was not part of the unanimous consent 
request by the majority leader, as well 
as the grant program that was created 
under CARES. 
Smaller small businesses use these 
disaster loans. Why? Because it gives 
them working capital so they can stay 
in business. PPP covers payroll, but 
they need more than payroll. These are 
longer-term loans with no payments 
during the first year so that businesses 
can stay afloat after a disaster, and we 
qualify the coronavirus as one of those 
disasters. This is a critically important 
program in our State and in our Na-
tion. We added to it by providing a 
grant program up to $10,000 in grants, 
not loans, to small businesses. 
In my State of Maryland, we had 
12,000 small businesses that applied for 
that grant. We had 26,000 apply for the 
PPP. I am just pointing out how pop-
ular this program is. The grant pro-
gram is $10 billion. The PPP program is 
$349 billion. It ran out of money before 
the PPP grant program. We need to put 
more money in that grant program. 
The 
unanimous 
consent 
agreement 
didn’t do that. Thanks to the negotia-
tions of Senator SCHUMER
and the 
Democrats, we were able to get $50 bil-
lion put into the EIDL, the Economic 
Injury Disaster Loan program, which 
will be able to leverage about $300 bil-
lion of additional loans under that pro-
gram that will help the smaller of the 
small businesses. We were able to get 
$10 billion put into the EIDL grant pro-
gram so that they can open, once 
again, applications from small busi-
nesses that want to get the cash grant 
from the Small Business Administra-
tion. These loans and grants are made 
by SBA, not by financial institutions, 
so all small businesses have access. 
I did some rough calculations, and if 
my math is correct, in Maryland, the 
average size of the business that quali-
fied for the EIDL grant was between 
four and five employees. These are 
really the smallest of small businesses, 
and that is the group I hope we would 
want to help. The original UC did not 
have that. We now have funds in it. 
This package is much better to reach 
those small businesses that desperately 
need help. 
I brought this to the attention of 
Secretary Mnuchin shortly after our 
conversations on the floor last time, 
and 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Secretary 
Mnuchin. When I explained to him the 
EIDL program and I explained to him 
how these programs work for smaller 
small businesses, he showed interest, 
and I am glad that we were able to ne-
gotiate with him the additional $60 bil-
lion going into those programs. It is a 
better package thanks to the bipar-
tisan process. 
I do want to mention one additional 
issue that we need to deal with, and 
that is accountability. We need to get 
information on how these programs are 
working, and I would hope we would 
get bipartisan support for that. 
On April 17, I authored a letter with 
Senators SCHUMER, WYDEN, and SHA-
HEEN to Secretary Mnuchin and Admin-
istrator Carranza in which we asked for 
the PPP to give us the numbers and 
amount of loans disbursed to small 
businesses, including a breakout of 
loans by State, demographics, indus-
try, and loan size; the number and 
amount of loans disbursed to busi-
nesses under the NAICS 72 exception— 
that is the one for restaurants and the 
hospitality field; including a breakout 
of loans by State, demographics, and 
loan size. Give us a number of loans 
provided 
to 
nonprofits—nonprofits 
were for the first time eligible for 
these 7(a) loans—and religious institu-
tions, including a breakout of the loans 
by State, industry, and loan size; and 
the number of loans disbursed by lend-
ing institutions, so we could find out 
what the concentration is of these 
loans. We asked for similar informa-
tion in regards to the Economic Injury 
Disaster Loan program, the numbers, 
et cetera, giving us that information, 
including 
those 
who 
received 
the 
grants. 
Lastly, we ask for information about 
the loan forgiveness program because 
there is another program under the 
CARES Act that allows for a 6-month 
forgiveness of repayment of existing 
7(a) or 504 loans, and we need informa-
tion on that in order to carry out our 
responsibility of accountability. We 
have a responsibility to make sure the 
money is getting to the right places. 
I had a communication with Senator 
RUBIO
this week in which we both 
agreed that we are concerned that we 
might be seeing some large chains get-
ting more money than we think we in-
tended under the act. We intended 
there would be a $10 million cap; yet we 
see reports where certain businesses 
were able to find a way to get more 
than $10 million. We also had self-cer-
tification that there is need. You have 
to show that you were damaged by the 
coronavirus. We think we should exam-
ine whether there was any false certifi-
cation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2182 
April 21, 2020 
The first thing we want to do on the 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship 
Committee on a bipartisan basis is do 
our oversight to make sure that, if 
there is abuse, that we put a spotlight 
on it and correct it to make sure that 
the moneys go to the small businesses 
that we intended to receive help. 
We need now to work on the next 
stimulus package. I was glad to hear 
the President talk about this. Senator 
SCHUMER talked about it. Yes, our first 
priority should be the health and wel-
fare of the American people in dealing 
with the coronavirus itself, and we 
need to do more. We clearly need to do 
more with State and local govern-
ments. That is going to be a critical 
part of the next package. But we also 
need to look at improvements in the 
small business package. We know that, 
through this 8–week period for repay-
ment, many of us have heard that they 
need additional flexibility. After all, 
how do they predict when they can re-
open if government has told them they 
have to stay closed? We need to give 
some degree of flexibility in the 8–week 
period. 
We have different small businesses 
that want us to consider their eligi-
bility. What happens after 8 weeks? If 
we are still seeing our economy not up 
to full speed, we need to talk about 
how we transition after 8 weeks to 
make sure these small businesses can 
succeed. 
The lessons learned on the CARES 
Act, the lesson learned on this legisla-
tion we are taking up this afternoon is, 
when we work together, when we nego-
tiate together, when we do a bipartisan 
package which the American people ex-
pect us to do during this national 
emergency, we get a better product, 
and we can do it quicker. I urge us all, 
as we move on to the fourth stimulus 
package, let’s start from the beginning 
in a bipartisan way so that we can get 
the very best product for the American 
people and deal with this national cri-
sis. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. LEE). 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
f 
REOPENING THE ECONOMY 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, no amount 
of 
money—not 
all 
the 
money 
in 
China—will save us from ourselves. Our 
only hope of rescuing this great coun-
try is to reopen the economy. If you 
print up billions of dollars and give it 
to people, they are unlikely to spend it 
until you end the quarantine. 
The good news, though, is that the 
scientific community finally has facts 
instead of conjecture. The models that 
used 3.4 percent mortality were, fortu-
nately, very wrong. Random samples of 
thousands of people have now been 
tested for antibodies or immunity to 
coronavirus. 
Two 
large 
randomized 
studies in California show similar re-
sults. The number of people who al-
ready 
developed 
antibodies 
to 
the 
coronavirus is 25 to 50 times higher 
than the number that is being reported 
as infected. This is great news. This 
study means that the mortality rate 
may well be 25 to 50 times less deadly 
than previously thought. 
The virus is still dangerous, and we 
shouldn’t ignore the risks, but we 
should put those risks in perspective. 
These randomized tests indicate that, 
instead of a 3.4 percent mortality, that 
the rate could be as much as only 0.1 
percent or 0.2 percent. We now have 
scientific evidence from randomized 
studies that we can manage this dis-
ease without continuing the draconian 
lockdown of the economy. 
The question before us isn’t to do 
nothing or to print endless amounts of 
bailout cash. The debate should now in-
clude the one choice that will get our 
economy 
growing 
again: 
reopening 
American commerce. 
Today, I rise in opposition to spend-
ing $500 billion more. The virus bail-
outs have already cost over $2 trillion. 
Our annual deficit this year will ap-
proach $4 trillion. We can’t continue on 
this course. No amount of bailout dol-
lars will stimulate an economy that is 
being strangled by quarantine. 
It is not a lack of money that plagues 
us but a lack of commerce. This eco-
nomic calamity only resolves when we 
begin to reopen the economy. Opening 
the economy will require Americans to 
rise above partisanship, to understand 
that deaths from infectious disease will 
continue, but that we cannot indefi-
nitely quarantine. 
Make no mistake about it, this has 
been a difficult month for our country. 
For many of us, we have not seen a 
greater challenge. I am encouraged to 
see how our communities are respond-
ing. In Kentucky, we have seen tremen-
dous collaboration. People from all 
walks of life have come together to 
help each other. We have worked to 
identify and supply additional protec-
tive gear, masks, and gloves to protect 
our doctors and nurses who risk their 
lives on a daily basis. 
UPS has set up an airlift operation 
out of Louisville that includes a 
healthcare facility for FEMA. This lets 
FEMA make overnight deliveries from 
anywhere in the country. Over 3 mil-
lion pounds of masks, gloves, and other 
equipment have been shipped to the 
Louisville airport by UPS. 
We have worked with some of our 
bourbon distillers to assist them in 
transitioning to producing hand sani-
tizer. We helped repatriate Americans 
trapped overseas. We also have seen 
how our communities have banded to-
gether to support neighbors, busi-
nesses, and those in need. 
When protective equipment was in 
short supply, we discovered a way to 
use industrial masks, and we supported 
legislation to allow us to bring ap-
proximately 30 million masks into the 
medical community. When the FDA 
wouldn’t approve COVID–19 tests other 
than the CDC’s—a test that initially 
failed—we introduced legislation that 
circumvented 
the 
FDA 
and 
cir-
cumvented the redtape to get testing 
done quicker. 
Over the years, the U.S. has accumu-
lated more than $23 trillion in debt, 
spending money that we do not have 
and borrowing from our kids’ and our 
grandkids’ future. The gargantuan Fed-
eral bailout that just passed over $2 
trillion brings us closer and closer to a 
point of no return, a point in which the 
world loses confidence in the dollar and 
a point in which our debt becomes an 
existential threat to our security. The 
United States is already having to bor-
row simply to pay our promises to sen-
ior citizens. 
The U.S. is borrowing about $1 tril-
lion a year just to pay for everyday ob-
ligations. This is before the pandemic 
bailout. The U.S. is already borrowing 
nearly $2 million every minute. With 
the recent $2 trillion bailout, we are 
borrowing faster than we have ever 
borrowed before. 
Had we practiced sound budgeting in 
the past, we would have been in a sig-
nificantly better position to weather 
this storm. Congress’ failures of the 
past, coupled with the pandemic prices 
of the present, could seriously jeop-
ardize our economic future. In this mo-
ment, we need to think carefully about 
what we do next. 
To stop the spread of this virus, com-
merce has been disrupted, businesses 
have closed, and millions have lost 
their jobs. Right now, the number is 20 
million unemployed. The job losses will 
continue no matter how much money 
you throw at it until you reopen the 
economy. 
Our government has intervened with 
unprecedented scale to prop up our 
economy. We have injected $2 trillion. 
I do believe it makes sense for the gov-
ernment to provide support to busi-
nesses and families who can’t make it 
through this. I supported expanding 
unemployment benefits for workers 
displaced by government quarantine, 
including 
self-employed 
individuals 
that have lost their businesses. But 
make no mistake, the massive eco-
nomic calamity we are experiencing 
right now was caused by government. 
Passing out $1,200 checks indiscrimi-
nately to people who haven’t lost their 
jobs will do nothing to rescue the coun-
try. If we were going to make discrete 
direct payments, the criteria should 
have been sending checks to people 
who needed it, people who lost their 
jobs, people furloughed, people who had 
wage cuts. Instead of directing help to 
the unemployed, though, some of these 
bailout checks will go to couples who 
earn nearly $200,000 a year. But you 
could give everybody in the country 
$12,000, and it wouldn’t end this reces-
sion. Our recovery only comes when 
the quarantine has ended. 
Experts will disagree on the exact 
date that we should reopen the econ-
omy, but sane, rational counsel should 
continue to push for the quickest end 
possible. Opining about never shaking 
hands again is a recipe for keeping the 
economy closed until no one dies from

infectious disease. While the infectious 
disease experts should be queried, so, 
too, should economists. We should seek 
counsel about balancing the harm to 
health caused by disease with the harm 
to health caused by enforcing dysfunc-
tion on the economy—not easy deci-
sions. 
Most importantly, leaders in each 
State must weigh in on the problem. 
New York City’s opening date will be 
different from Fargo, ND. We need to 
get past a one-size-fits-all approach to 
infectious disease. 
Realize that most of this money that 
is being loaned to small business is not 
a loan. Most of this money will not be 
repaid. It will ultimately be considered 
grants that will be added to our na-
tional debt. 
Let’s be honest about this. Applica-
tions for the program opened to over-
whelming initial demand. The current 
data indicates that the money is gone, 
so now, here we are again, with leader-
ship from both parties saying, Let’s do 
another $300 billion, what is another 
couple hundred billion dollars? But re-
alize the money desired is not money 
we have saved for a rainy day. This 
money doesn’t exist anywhere. It will 
be created or borrowed. Even more 
alarming than the money is the idea 
that one Senator can stand on the floor 
and pass legislation spending a half- 
trillion dollars and have no recorded 
vote and no debate. 
Look, I understand the hardships of 
Senators returning from around the 
country, so I have not invoked the Sen-
ate rules to demand a recorded vote. I 
did return today, though, so that his-
tory will record that not everyone gave 
in to the massive debt Congress is cre-
ating. My hope is that, across the 
country, there will remain a vibrant 
voice for limited government for our 
constitutional Republic. I don’t want 
to see this massive accumulation of 
debt destroy this great country. My ad-
vice to the Senate and to the American 
people is let’s be aware of what we are 
doing by creating all this new debt, and 
let’s think before we jump to a terrible, 
terrible conclusion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, we 
are going to vote here in a minute on 
the next package that is going to try 
to help our Nation address these un-
precedented 
challenges. 
I 
want 
to 
thank the majority leader, the White 
House, and the Democrats who have 
come forward to do this. 
It is very important that we are 
doing this. In my view, as the leader 
said, we should have done this 12 days 
ago. We are facing unprecedented chal-
lenges. When we passed the CARES Act 
4 weeks ago—and I think Leader 
MCCONNELL did an incredible job bring-
ing the U.S. Senate together on a vote 
of 96–0, as Minority Leader SCHUMER 
mentioned with regard to this legisla-
tion that our Nation needed so des-
perately and that we are trying to pro-
vide more resources because the re-
sources needed had already been spent. 
After that vote, I came to the floor, 
and I made a statement that, although 
I was proud to have voted for that and 
proud to have been a part of the nego-
tiations for that because our Nation 
was going to need it—did need it, des-
perately—that we knew there would be 
mistakes. We knew there would be 
areas that weren’t covered that should 
have been. We knew elements of that 
bill would run out of money, as they 
have. 
I made a plea that we should be here 
working on behalf of the people we rep-
resent. Our Governors are back home 
working hard, doing a good job; but as 
I mentioned, the evening that we 
passed the CARES Act, from the per-
spective of Congress—House and Sen-
ate—this should be our duty station as 
we address these unprecedented chal-
lenges, and I still believe that. We have 
heard about the difficulties that could 
come with voting and having Members 
of Congress catch COVID–19, but we 
can do this safely. We can vote safely. 
As Senator LEE mentioned earlier, 
Americans all over the country are on 
the 
frontlines—truck 
drivers, 
healthcare workers, grocery store at-
tendants—helping their fellow Ameri-
cans. If they can be doing that, I think 
we should be here working on behalf of 
them. 
There is so much more to do. We need 
to be nimble. Let me give you an exam-
ple. The energy sector right now— 
hugely important to my State—is 
being decimated because of what is 
happening globally with regard to en-
ergy prices. Great workers are being 
laid off. Small businesses in many sec-
tors in Alaska like tourism are at a 
huge risk. Had we been here—you 
know, there is a lot of talk right now 
about the delay—the minority leader, 
Speaker PELOSI, wouldn’t have had an 
excuse to delay the funding for the 
PPP for 12 days. How many small busi-
nesses and jobs were lost because of 
that delay? We will never know, but I 
am sure it was in the thousands. 
I am reading a book right now, 
‘‘1776,’’ by David McCullough. It is 
about the incredible challenges that 
our Nation went through at the birth 
of our Nation. It is mostly about 
George Washington and the tough bat-
tles he led and fought. He lost a lot of 
them in New York. 
One remarkable thing about that 
book is, for almost the entire year in 
1776, the Continental Congress was ac-
tually in session directing General 
Washington. They were in Philadelphia 
at enormous risk as the British were 
closing in on them. But as the war was 
raging for most of that year—that re-
markable year of 1776—they were work-
ing. 
We have so much more work to do for 
our Nation in these unprecedented 
times, whether it is confirming judges 
or phase four of an infrastructure pack-
age that we should be working on or 
even confirming key members of the 
executive branch. I am hopeful that, 
just in a couple of minutes, we are 
going to be able to move forward with 
Rear Admiral Michael Weahkee’s nom-
ination to be the Director of Indian 
Health Service at the Department of 
Health and Human Services. As our Na-
tive communities are being threatened 
by COVID–19, having this admiral, who 
has got broad support throughout our 
Tribal governments, including in Alas-
ka, be able to be confirmed right now is 
just one example of the work that I am 
hopeful we can be doing. 
So this should be our duty station, 
working around the clock for people we 
represent, getting through these un-
precedented times, being able to ad-
dress challenges as they arise—and 
they are arising every hour, every 
minute. 
I want to end on a positive note— 
speaking of duty station—a good news 
story that involves the people of inte-
rior Alaska and our wonderful U.S. 
military. Right now, literally as we 
speak, there are two F–35s that have 
left 
Texas—brand 
new—coming 
to 
Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. Fif-
teen years ago, Eielson Air Force Base 
was on the verge of being shut down. 
The interior Alaska communities of 
Fairbanks, North Pole, and so many 
leaders fought that. They said, No, this 
is a strategic location for our military, 
we shouldn’t shut this down. 
Now, these communities today will 
be receiving the first of 54 F–35s, two 
squadrons. I want to commend, not just 
my fellow Alaskans for their grit and 
determination to make this day hap-
pen—a huge day in my State—but the 
U.S. military. The U.S. military, a 
year and a half ago, said the F–35s will 
start coming to Alaska in April 2020. 
Despite this pandemic, that is what is 
happening today—remarkable grit and 
determination of my fellow Alaskans 
but also remarkable service to our Na-
tion by the U.S. Air Force delivering 
these F–35s on time. That will make 
my State have over 100 fifth generation 
fighters protecting our country. So 
this is an inspiring story, as we are 
hearing all kinds of inspiring stories 
throughout our Nation, throughout 
these challenging times. 
But in my view, we should be ready 
to help these great people that we lead 
and that we serve to get them through 
these unprecedented times. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2187 
April 21, 2020 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT 
AGREEMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that Senator PAUL be recog-
nized to speak for up to 5 minutes and 
offer a unanimous consent request and 
that, following his remarks, I imme-
diately be recognized with no inter-
vening action. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, no virus, 
not even a plague, should cause us to 
forget that our freedom is the result of 
resisting the concentration of power in 
the hands of a few. 
Recently, there has been dangerous 
talk of the President adjourning Con-
gress. I am reminded of the long 
English battle to forbid the King from 
dissolving Parliament. In fact, Charles 
I lost his head partly because he in-
sisted on dissolving Parliament. In 
those days, Parliament did not take 
Charles’ royal power grab laying down. 
When Charles I dissolved Parliament in 
1629, members took matters into their 
own hands and descended on the speak-
er, John Finch, and sat on him. Since 
he could not rise, the Parliament could 
not close. While he squirmed and was 
held down, Parliament passed several 
motions, condemning the King’s power 
grab. 
Ultimately, the English Parliament 
would change the Constitution to for-
bid the King from dissolving Par-
liament. Now, I am not suggesting we 
hold the President of the Senate down 
and commandeer the Senate—though 
the idea has crossed my mind. 
Whatever path of resistance we take, 
talk of the administration adjourning 
or 
temporarily 
dissolving 
Congress 
should loudly be resisted as if the Re-
public depended on it. 
Perhaps more alarming than allow-
ing a President threatening to dissolve 
Congress is that Congress currently 
has allowed itself to become more of an 
oligarchy than an assembly. A few 
Members of the leadership are set to 
pass legislation, spending nearly a half 
a trillion dollars, without any recorded 
vote or debate. Shouldn’t someone 
shout stop? Shouldn’t someone point 
out the terrible precedent of having a 
few Members speak for all the Mem-
bers? 
I, for one, believe that if there exists 
too much danger to have Congress 
meet—and if there exists too much 
danger to have Congress meet in per-
son, we should allow emergency voting 
remotely. 
In that vein, I offer the following res-
olution. I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the consider-
ation of my resolution at the desk; I 
further ask that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble agreed to, and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
without any intervening action or de-
bate. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard. 
The majority leader. 
f 
STUDENT VETERAN CORONAVIRUS 
RESPONSE ACT OF 2020 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 6322, which was received 
from the House. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report the bill by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 6322) to make certain improve-
ments in the educational assistance benefits 
under the laws administered by the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs in the case of 
changes to courses of education by reason of 
emergency situations, and for other pur-
poses. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed, and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 6322) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time, 
and passed. 
f 
SIGNING AUTHORITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the major-
ity leader and the senior Senator from 
Alaska be authorized to sign duly en-
rolled bills or joint resolutions through 
Monday, May 4, 2020. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. As if in executive 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Indian Affairs be dis-
charged of PN1250 and that the Senate 
proceed to the en bloc consideration of 
the following nominations: Executive 
Calendar Nos. 545, 546, and PN1250. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the nominations 
en bloc. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate vote on the 
nominations en bloc with no inter-
vening action or debate; that, if con-
firmed, the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table, en bloc; that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the nominations of 
Mitchell A. Silk, of New York, to be an 
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; 
John Bobbitt, of Texas, to be an Assist-
ant Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development; and Michael D. Weahkee, 
of New Mexico, to be Director of the In-
dian Health Service, Department of 
Health and Human Services, for the 
term of four years, en bloc? 
The nominations were confirmed en 
bloc.

SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
GABRIELLA 
MILLER KIDS FIRST RESEARCH 
ACT 2.0 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 21, 2020 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Gabriella Miller Kids First 
Research Act 2.0, a bipartisan bill that I intro-
duced on Friday, April 17th. If enacted, this bill 
would make great strides to fund the fight 
against childhood cancer, birth defects, and 
other rare pediatric diseases. 
Cancer is the single leading cause of death 
among American children of any disease. The 
U.S. is rapidly approaching 16,000 children di-
agnosed with cancer annually, and the inci-
dence of childhood cancer has been steadily 
increasing over time. Additionally, one in 33 
babies born in the U.S. are affected by a birth 
defect, and birth defects are the leading cause 
of death among infants. These pediatric dis-
eases are still poorly understood, and addi-
tional funding is greatly needed to augment 
existing research to promote new discoveries 
for children affected by them. 
In an effort to uncover new insights into the 
biology of pediatric disease, Congress passed 
the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act in 
2014, which established a Ten-Year Pediatric 
Research Initiative Fund within the National In-
stitutes of Health’s (NIH) Common Fund. The 
law authorized $12.6 million in funds annually 
for pediatric disease research through the 
Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research 
Program, commonly known as Kids First. 
Since the original law was enacted, Kids First 
has sequenced more than 20,000 samples 
from childhood cancer and structural birth de-
fect cohorts. Most recently the program initi-
ated the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Re-
source Center—a comprehensive integrated 
data resource for research and patient com-
munities meant to advance discoveries. 
The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 
2.0 builds off the important progress made by 
the 2014 Gabriella Miller Kids First Research 
Act by providing a new source of funding for 
the Kids First Research Fund. Specifically, the 
bill would redirect civil monetary sanctions lev-
ied against pharmaceutical manufacturers by 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
for violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act. By diverting penalties from pharma-
ceutical companies that break the law, the bill 
would sustain Kids First’s critical childhood 
disease research for generations to come. 
The 2014 law and the bill I introduced Fri-
day is named to honor 10-year-old Gabriella 
Miller who passed away from an inoperable 
brain tumor. She was a fierce advocate for 
childhood cancer research, and her efforts to 
boost awareness of pediatric cancer helped 
raise funds for children’s cancer charities. I 
would like to thank Gabriella’s mother and my 
constituent, Ellyn Miller, for her tireless advo-
cacy on behalf of children with cancer through 
Smashing Walnuts. I am honored to have 
worked closely with Ellyn on the Gabriella Mil-
ler Kids First Research Act 2.0. 
I introduced this bill to find treatments and 
cures so that our nation’s children will have a 
fighting chance to survive cancer and other 
rare disease. The Gabriella Miller Kids First 
Research Act 2.0 will reaffirm our strong com-
mitment to finding cures for pediatric diseases.

RECOGNIZING BOBBY ZAREM 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 21, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Mr. Bobby Zarem of 
Georgia’s First District for his decades of influ-
ence as a legendary publicist. 
Mr. Zarem is known for helping launch the 
careers of well-known celebrities like Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and John Travolta, and 
spearheading publicity for movies such as Sat-
urday Night Fever and Dances with Wolves to 
root them in American cinematic history. 
He eventually created Zarem Incorporated 
in New York, which is now one of the most 
successful public relations and publicity busi-
nesses in the country. 
Notably, he was the creative genius behind 
the ‘‘I Love New York’’ campaign, which is 
now advertised on t-shirts and hats throughout 
the world. 
Although much of his success was on 
Broadway and Hollywood, Mr. Zarem has 
been a pillar in making his hometown of Sa-
vannah the artistic and cinematic success it is 
today. 
He was given the Lifetime Achievement 
Award at the Savannah Film Festival to recog-
nize 
his 
outstanding 
accomplishments 
throughout his life. 
I want to congratulate Mr. Zarem on making 
Savannah proud, and I wish him the best of 
luck in all his endeavors to come.

SHAQUAN GRIFFIN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 21, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Shaquan Grif-
fin for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Serv-
ice Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Shaquan Griffin is a student at Arvada High 
School and received this award because his 
determination and hard work have allowed him 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Shaquan 
Griffin is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels 
strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Shaquan Griffin for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

HON. CONOR LAMB 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 21, 2020 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
remember 
and 
honor 
the 
life 
of 
Amil 
Padezanin, a fellow Marine and a pillar in the 
community in Beaver County. 
Mr. Padezanin served in the U.S. Marine 
Corps during the Korean War. He was a re-
tired brakeman and conductor working for 42 
years out of the Conway Yards for Conrail, 
formerly known as Penn Central and the 
Pennsylvania Railroad. 
During his 85 years in Freedom, PA, Mr. 
Padezanin played varsity football at Freedom 
High School, served on the town council, led 
the town’s holiday festivities, was a member of 
the Freedom Serbian Club, and was an avid 
Freedom Bulldogs sports fan. He was also a 
member of the St. Elijah Serbian 0rthodox 
Church in Aliquippa, and a member of the 
Serb National Federation, the oldest and larg-
est Serbian fraternal organization in the coun-
try. 
I want to express my deepest condolences 
to Mr. Padezanin’s wife Martha and the entire 
Padezanin family. 
We will all miss Amil, but it may help to re-
member that there is no such thing as a 
former Marine, and that his duties are much 
needed in the next world. As it says in our 
hymn, ‘‘if the Army and the Navy ever look on 
heaven’s scenes, they will find the streets are 
guarded by United States Marines.’’

an active member and faithful leader in his 
church, and coaching his youngest daughters’ 
various sports teams, his life was a blessing to 
countless individuals.

CLARIFICATION 
OF 
CONGRES-
SIONAL 
INTENT 
REGARDING 
SECTION 6412 OF PUBLIC LAW 
116–92 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 21, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, last year I in-
troduced H.R. 3494, the Damon Paul Nelson 
and Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, 
and 2020. The IAA was included in the Fiscal 
Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, 
which became Public Law 116–92. 
Section 6412, a provision that I authored 
and that first passed the House as part of the 
IAA, authorizes the Director of the CIA to pro-
vide enhanced injury benefits to a covered 
employee and/or qualifying dependents who 
suffer an injury overseas due to war, insur-
gency, hostile act, or terrorist activities. 
I rise today to clarify the intent of Congress 
on one point: due to the unique and limited 
circumstances under which these benefits are 
authorized, and for the purposes of Section 
104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, all 
amounts paid pursuant to Section 6412 should 
be treated as amount paid under chapter 81 of 
title 5, United States Code, regardless of 
whether the recipient would otherwise qualify 
for workmen’s compensation.

HARTMAYER 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER

Tuesday, April 21, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Bishop Gregory 
Hartmayer for being named the seventh Arch-
bishop of Atlanta by Holy Father Pope 
Francis. 
Bishop Hartmayer has remarkably served 
several roles in the church for over 40 years, 
including a guidance counselor, teacher, and

After spending many years in New York and 
Massachusetts, Bishop Hartmayer moved to 
Georgia to serve as a pastor and then bishop. 
He has been recognized by his community, 
family, and friends as a kind, faithful, and 
humble servant of the Lord. 
Bishop Hartmayer was appointed the four-
teenth bishop of the Diocese of Savannah by 
Pope Benedict the 16th in 2011. 
I was honored to have him as my guest at 
Pope Francis’ speech to a joint session of 
Congress in 2015. 
His life has been marked by graciously 
sharing wisdom, peace, and clarity with every-
one he encounters, and freely giving his re-
sources for the good of others. 
Thank you, Bishop Hartmayer, for your serv-
ice to the people of the Diocese of Savannah, 
and to Georgia’s First District. 
I know God will continue to use you in 
amazing ways as you serve as the seventh 
Archbishop of Atlanta, and I wish you all the 
best.

TAHOMA HIGH SCHOOL STATE 
CIVICS CHAMPIONS 
HON. KIM SCHRIER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 21, 2020 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, congratu-
lations to the hardworking students of Tahoma 
High School from Maple Valley, Washington, 
for being selected for the 11th consecutive 
time to represent Washington state in the an-
nual ‘‘We the People: The Citizens and the 
Constitution’’ competition organized by the 
Center for Civic Education. 
These dedicated students have spent the 
past year studying the history and principles of 
the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. They 
have gained a better understanding of our na-
tion’s founding values, representative democ-
racy, and how the lawmaking process func-
tions. 
The annual in-person ‘‘We the People’’ final 
competition typically takes place in Wash-
ington, D.C., in late April. Understandably, due 
to the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, the 
event was cancelled this year. Regardless, I 
am tremendously proud of these students’ dili-
gent work over the past year. Civic education 
is vital to a well-rounded high school edu-
cation. In this time of crisis, it is more impor-
tant than ever that young people are well-in-
formed so they can engage constructively with 
public policy. I hope that these talented stu-
dents feel empowered to vote, participate in 
politics, and be leading voices for positive 
change in our state and country. I am excited 
to hear about how they carry the principles 
and values of civic education into their future 
endeavors and become the next generation of 
leaders. 
I am especially grateful to Gretchen Wulfing 
for her dedication to civic education. In addi-
tion to teaching government at Tahoma High 
School, Gretchen has coached Civic Edu-
cation for 12 years. Most recently, in 2016, 
she was honored as one of Washington’s dis-
tinguished Civic Educators. 
Teachers like Gretchen are especially vital 
in this uncertain time, and the 8th District is 
extremely appreciative for her dedication to 
educating students in Maple Valley. 
Finally, I would like to individually recognize 
each student, whose tremendous commitment 
and enthusiasm to learning our Constitution, I 
deeply 
admire. 
Congratulations 
to: 
Riley 
Barlett,

Congratulations again to Gretchen and 
these bright students from Tahoma High 
School for their dedication to civic education. 
We in Washington’s 8th District couldn’t be 
more proud of them, and we wish them the 
best of luck.

HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN

Tuesday, April 21, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of the extended members of the 
Cortez and Nicolas family of Virginia and 
Texas who are Hispanic media pioneers and 
American patriots serving our nation in war 
and peace for over 75 years. 
In the 40s and 50s, Mr. Raul Cortez devel-
oped KCOR radio and television and the 
Spanish International Network which grew into 
UNIVISON the nation’s largest provider of 
Spanish language content thanks to the major 
contributions of his son-in-law Mr. Emilio Nico-
las, his wife Irma, their son Emilio Nicolas Jr. 
and family. In 1976 the Cortez and Nicolas 
family established the nation’s First Satellite 
Interconnected TV Network which provided 
coast to coast coverage. 
I commend Mr. Frank Cortez Jr. and Mr. 
Daniel P. Cortez of Stafford, Virginia, for their 
Spanish and English language media contribu-
tions through their patriotic and informational 
media broadcast segments in print and elec-
tronically. 
Five generations of Cortez and Nicolas fam-
ily members have answered the military call to 
duty since World War I including Mr. Juan 
Manuel Cortez, Mr. Raul Cortez Jr. who 
served in Korea, Mr. Daniel Cortez who was 
wounded and decorated for extraordinary her-
oism in Vietnam and Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Cor-
tez II and his wife April Cortez who honorably 
served in the Air Force during Operation En-
during Freedom. 
The Cortez and Nicolas families are proud 
Americans of Hispanic descent and remain the 
genuine pioneers of America’s Hispanic media 
and military patriotism. Their veteran’s activ-
ism continues to this day with the develop-
ment of the National Vet Corps Alliance where 
Mr. Daniel Cortez is chairman in support of 
H.R. 886, The Veterans Treatment Court Co-
ordination Act of 2019 which I was proud to 
co-sponsor. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recogni-
tion and celebration of the Cortez and Nicolas 
families’ contributions to Hispanic media, our 
brave armed forces, and to the United States 
of America.

INTRODUCTION 
OF THE ROBUST

RESPONSE 
TO 
PANDEMIC ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 21, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce the Systemic Risk Miti-
gation Act with my colleagues, Representative 
JAN SCHAKOWSKY of Illinois and Representa-
tive MARK TAKANO of California. 
As COVID–19 devastates nearly every 
country in the world, it is more important than 
ever to affirm that the United States will sup-
port developing countries in getting the help 
they need from International Financial Institu-
tions (IFIs) like the World Bank and Inter-
national Monetary Fund (IMF). This bill accom-
plishes that by: Instructing U.S. representa-
tives to the IFis to support a suspension of 
debt payments to those institutions during the 
COVID–19 pandemic; Instructing U.S. rep-
resentatives to the IFis to oppose programs 
that undermine countries’ ability to respond to 
COVID–19, such as those that encourage cuts 
to public health spending; Instructing the U.S. 
representative to the IMF to support issuing 3 
trillion ‘‘Special Drawing Rights.’’ 
The issuance of ‘‘Special Drawing Rights’’ 
will help countries avoid depleting their re-
serves during the turbulent economic times 
ahead; 3 trillion SDR’s will help all of us—and 
especially emerging markets and developing 
economies—avoid financial catastrophe. 
I urge this body to advance this legislation.

25TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 21, 2020 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the Aviation Museum of Kentucky on 
their 25th anniversary. The Aviation Museum 
began as a dream of members of the Ken-
tucky Aviation History Roundtable. In April of 
1995, the Aviation Museum was incorporated 
as a non-profit and it opened to the public in 
August with the help of the surviving members 
of the 1942 Doolittle Squadron. 
The Aviation Museum is located at Lex-
ington, Kentucky’s Blue Grass Airport. The 
Aviation Museum helps the general public un-
derstand and become enthusiastic about avia-
tion, thus building support for the aviation in-
dustry. This industry contributes billions of dol-
lars and thousands of jobs to Kentucky’s 
economy. Kentucky exported $14.6 billion in 
aerospace parts in 2019. 
The Aviation Museum provides many edu-
cational opportunities for Kentucky’s young 
people through flight training, Learning through 
Aviation, and Aviation Summer Camp. An im-
portant part of the Aviation Museum’s mission 
is educating youth about career potential in 
the field of aviation. 
The Aviation Museum provides over 25,000 
square feet of exhibit space. Exhibits show-
case the science of flight and the history of 
aviation in Kentucky. Attracting visitors from all 
50 states and indeed from around the world, 
the Aviation Museum contributes to the tour-
ism economy of Kentucky. 
The Kentucky Aviation Hall of Fame is 
housed at the Aviation Museum and tells the 
stories of 99 Kentuckians with special achieve-
ments. Recognized honorees include military 
pilots, civilian pilots, and scientists. 
The Aviation Museum of Kentucky fills an 
important role in Kentucky. It is my honor to 
acknowledge them on their 25th anniversary 
before the United States Congress.

Major Curtis Ivins. 
Major Ivins is currently assigned to the 2nd 
Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division stationed 
at Ft. Stewart, Georgia, which is in Georgia’s 
First District. 
He is not only a hero in his service with our 
nation’s armed forces, but also with helping 
people in his local community. 
In February of this year, Curt was witness to 
a single vehicle accident in Chatham County, 
GA. 
Without hesitation, he immediately engaged 
and was able to free the mother and two sons 
from the vehicle before it continued to roll. 
Curt saw the accident, ran from his vehicle, 
broke their windows, and cut seat belts to pull 
them to safety just before the vehicle rolled 
again. 
I am proud to represent thousands of mili-
tary servicemen and women. This includes 
Curt, and all those who rise to the occasion in 
all times of need and put their lives at risk for 
others.

determination and hard work have allowed him 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Taelyn 
Risby is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels 
strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Taelyn Risby for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.
