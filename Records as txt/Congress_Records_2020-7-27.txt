COUNTERING CHINESE DOMINANCE 
IN TELECOM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, our Nation is facing a critical 
point as we discern whether we will 
lead or whether we will follow in 21st 
century innovation. 
The Chinese Communist Party, fol-
lowing years of underhanded practices, 
including cheating and even outright 
theft, is poised to gain global domi-
nance in the technology and tele-
communications sectors. Their ulti-
mate goal is controlling critical mar-
ket segments and even weaponizing the 
global supply chains for medical equip-
ment, weapons, and other critical elec-
tronics. 
Through pawns like Huawei and ZTE, 
this regime is seeking to dominate 
next-generation technology like artifi-
cial intelligence, semiconductor pro-
duction, quantum computing, 5G, and 
beyond. 
Funded directly by the Chinese Com-
munist Party, these companies are free 
to operate however they please, dis-
torting the global market and edging 
out free-market competitors in their 
mission to monopolize the industry. 
If we do not intercede, Huawei and 
ZTE could stand to be the only compa-
nies left with the ability to innovate. 
This is a daunting threat as we look 
past 5G to 6G. 
As I consider the innovation that I 
personally have witnessed in the span 
of my own medical career, I recognize 
that there is a world of opportunity to 
be discovered in the remaining days of 
the 21st century, from remote surgeries 
and autonomous vehicles to other inev-
itable additions to our ever-increasing 
virtual world. 
If the United States does not act now 
to correct course, the Chinese Govern-
ment will succeed in controlling the 
world’s electronic network—our data, 
our research, and, ultimately, our secu-
rity. 
As a nation, we cannot allow this 
malicious regime to take hold of the 
world’s network. America needs to lead 
the way and work with our allies to 
beat the Chinese Communist Party in 
deploying next-generation telecom net-
works. 
On the China Task Force, we are de-
veloping pragmatic solutions to stand 
up to the Chinese Government. We are 
working on legislation to standardize 
and create interoperability to every 
point in radio access networks. Open 
RAN, or O-RAN, are critical to driving 
competition in existing networks. 
Additionally, we are working to less-
en Huawei and ZTE’s grip on the global 
market. For years, Americans have 
gone to great lengths to break up 
trusts and other monopolies by enforc-
ing free-market principles. Now, the 
China Task Force is developing oppor-
tunities to do this on a global scale. 
Throughout this process, we must be 
mindful of the supply chains that are 
used to manufacture every component 
of the devices that we rely on daily. I 
am working to end Chinese dominance 
in manufacturing and sourcing, from 
rare earth elements and mineral ex-
traction all the way to their undercut-
ting of the internet. By ending this 
stranglehold, we can ensure that China 
will not be able to control and dictate 
their terms for any nation to access fu-
ture technologies. 
All of us surely can agree that Amer-
icans must be set up once again to lead 
the world in research and innovation. 
We want American jobs for American 
citizens. We want American innovation 
for the American people. And as Presi-
dent Trump said last week, we want 
the American Dream for American 
children. 
Congress must counter the Chinese 
Communist Party’s efforts to dominate 
the telecom sector, and we must ensure 
that Americans can step up to the 
challenge. 
For centuries, Americans have been 
trailblazers. Once again, we are facing 
a new frontier. This is not the time to 
stop moving forward. This is our 
chance, and this is the time to make a 
difference.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3862 
July 27, 2020 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak in sup-
port of two pieces of legislation coming 
to the floor this week, the Child Care Is 
Essential Act, and the Child Care for 
Economic Recovery Act. 
This pandemic has exposed fault lines 
that exist just beneath the surface of 
our society. Whether it is a broken 
healthcare system or the consequences 
of our Nation’s history of racial injus-
tice, this pandemic is exacerbating 
harms done by systems that fail our 
families. Our system of childcare is no 
exception. 
Childcare is a powerful tool for edu-
cating our children and for fueling our 
economy. If we unite around its utility 
and take decisive action to save the 
childcare sector, we can help rebuild 
and revitalize our future. 
Simply put, childcare is essential. 
But ignored, underappreciated, and ne-
glected for so long, our system of early 
care and education is now at a break-
ing point. 
Right now, 40 percent of our Nation’s 
childcare centers and family childcare 
homes will be forced to close perma-
nently without immediate financial 
support. Our children, moms, dads, doc-
tors, nurses, teachers, small business 
owners, and over 23 million families 
will have nowhere to turn. 
Think about that. Before this pan-
demic, it was difficult and sometimes 
nearly impossible for working families 
to find quality, affordable childcare. If 
the pandemic destroys 4 out of every 10 
childcare spaces, how will parents re-
turn to work? How will businesses re-
open? How many children will be 
pushed out of their classrooms? 
Great outcomes for an entire genera-
tion of children are at stake and could 
be impacted for years if we don’t invest 
now in early care and education. With 
proper investment, childcare can com-
bat the economic and social inequities 
of our time, in addition to providing a 
foundation for our children. What is 
more, with an investment in childcare, 
we can stabilize and secure American 
families. 
Before the pandemic, childcare costs 
often exceeded a family’s rent or mort-
gage payment, driving parents out of 
the labor market entirely. Parents of 
color face even more hurdles and costs 
in finding affordable, high-quality care. 
Economists are predicting that los-
ing access to childcare is not just 
about losing 2 or 3 years of income. It 
is an entirely different trajectory for 
the rest of a parent’s life. This also dis-
proportionately impacts women in the 
workplace. 
The rising costs of childcare are asso-
ciated with a 13 percent decline in em-
ployment of mothers with children 
under 5. Investing in childcare is about 
ensuring moms can pay the bills and 
pursue their dreams. It is also an in-
vestment in opportunity and in equal-
ity for our Nation’s mothers. 
These bills will also honor our Na-
tion’s caregivers, who provide an essen-
tial service to our children, economy, 
and community. In an industry where 
96 percent of childcare professionals 
are women, and 40 percent of them are 
women of color, over 325,000 have lost 
their jobs since February. This work-
force is already underpaid, many of 
them barely making minimum wage. 
Our failure to value the work of care-
givers is one of the many examples of 
how our society and how Congress fails 
to value women’s work and, especially, 
the work of women of color. 
Finally, it is not just our families 
who rely on childcare. Childcare is es-
sential to our entire economy. 
A survey from Northeastern Univer-
sity tells us that during the pandemic, 
working parents lose, on average, a full 
day of work productivity every week 
due to a lack of childcare. We know 
that has repercussions for our busi-
nesses. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
Foundation found that in one State 
alone, a lack of childcare is estimated 
to cost employers almost as much as $3 
billion annually in lost productivity, 
absences, and turnover rate. 
The solution is not complicated. The 
problem we face is solvable. The two 
bills before us are a critical first step. 
Our Nation needs to seize this oppor-
tunity to provide equity in education, 
parity for women, and stability in our 
economy. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
pass the Child Care Is Essential Act 
and the Child Care for Economic Re-
covery Act. It is time to invest in our 
children, our women, and our economy. 
f 
SUPPORTING ESSENTIAL 
WORKERS IN FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, a strong, reliable food 
supply chain is important 365 days a 
year. But COVID–19 has underscored 
just how much we rely on this essential 
industry in times of crisis. 
The men and women who work to 
provide our Nation with the food, fiber, 
and energy that we depend on each and 
every day are among the unsung heroes 
in this crisis. 
In April, I introduced the GROCER 
Act to establish a Federal tax holiday 
for our grocery store and convenience 
store employees from February 15, 2020, 
to June 15, 2020. The bill benefits indi-
viduals making less than $75,000 a year 
and gives the Treasury Secretary the 
discretion to extend this benefit for an 
additional 3 months. 
To build on the support for the GRO-
CER Act, Congressman DWIGHT EVANS 
and I introduced the AG CHAIN Act. 
The AG CHAIN Act extends the GRO-
CER Act to the entire food supply 
chain defined by recent Department of 
Homeland Security guidance. That in-
cludes 
our 
farmers, 
ranchers, 
meatpackers, distributors, and more. It 
also builds on the GROCER Act to in-
clude a payroll tax exemption in addi-
tion to the Federal tax holiday. 
Supporting our essential workers in 
the food supply chain is something 
that Republicans, Democrats, and ev-
eryone in-between can get behind. 
A recent poll showed support from 
the public as well. According to the 
Morning Consult, 90 percent of voters 
consider agricultural and food produc-
tion workers essential, and 93 percent 
consider grocery store workers and 
convenience store workers essential. 
When it comes to providing tax relief 
to the essential workers who keep our 
grocery stores and our farms oper-
ational, two-thirds of voters supported 
some kind of tax relief for these indi-
viduals. 
b 0930 
Those numbers speak for themselves, 
Mr. Speaker. 
We all depend on a strong food supply 
chain to feed our families. Even in 
times of crisis, the shelves and coolers 
in our grocery stores have remained 
stocked. Now, that would not be the 
case if we were not blessed with such a 
hardworking and resilient agriculture 
industry. 
Food security is national security, 
and employees in the food supply chain 
are working overtime to ensure crops 
are harvested, shelves and coolers are 
stocked, and Americans have food on 
the table. 
The AG CHAIN Act is a simple way 
to say thank you to the hardworking 
men and women across the full spec-
trum of the food supply chain. It is a 
commonsense way to support these 
workers, and it is a way to put more of 
their hard-earned money back into 
their own pockets. 
Today and every day, I am grateful 
for the hard work of our food supply 
chain workers, and I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting the 
AG CHAIN Act.

A FEW THOUGHTS ON THE PASS-
ING OF MY FRIEND JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. FUDGE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, Henry 
Wadsworth Longfellow writes in part: 
Life is real! 
Life is earnest! 
And the grave is not its goal; 
Dust thou art to dust returneth, 
Was not spoken of the soul. 
John still lives in most of us because 
his soul, his spirit, and his heart still 
live. 
Mr. Speaker, like all Americans, I re-
acted with deep sadness to the passing 
of my friend, Congressman John Lewis. 
John and I served together for 12 years 
in Congress, and I was so proud to have 
known him as a colleague, a mentor, 
and a friend. 
A lot has been said about the man 
that John Lewis was, but what strikes 
me the most is the man that he never 
became.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3863 
July 27, 2020 
For a person who faced virulent ha-
tred, he was never a man who hated. 
For a person who stood as a focal 
point for an entire movement, he never 
focused the lens on himself. 
For a person born to segregation, he 
never excluded others from the move-
ment for equal rights. 
For a person whose voice pierced the 
air like a foghorn, he never spoke 
empty words. 
For a person to whom grace was too 
rarely extended in his life, he never al-
lowed himself to withhold it from those 
around him. 
For a person who was at the center of 
the Nation’s gravest affairs, he never 
passed up an opportunity to laugh or to 
dance. 
From his refusals, he became the 
man whom we admire so profoundly. 
John’s death comes at a turbulent time 
for our country, and his loss is sharply 
felt by the many who still fight for 
equality in our country. 
Young Black Americans struggling 
for equal treatment, women fighting 
for equal pay, LGBTQ advocates push-
ing for equal protection, marginalized 
people striving to protect their right to 
vote, and young leaders yearning for 
equity in a nation that has denied it 
for too long saw in John a model for 
perseverance, humility, courage, and 
leadership. 
We could not be forgiven for despair-
ing the loss of such a man as John 
Lewis in these times. But I think John 
would tell us to do otherwise. I think 
he might say that the movement for 
equality and equity in our Nation did 
not start with him and it shouldn’t die 
with him. 
He might look around at the newest 
generation of remarkable young Black 
and Brown leaders in technology, so-
cial justice, business, education, public 
service, and every other walk of Amer-
ican life and feel confident that, while 
the work remains, the fight is in good 
and capable hands. 
He, undoubtedly, would look at the 
progress we have made and the strug-
gles ahead and tell us not to dwell too 
long on the passing of one leader, how-
ever impactful, because there is just 
too much work to do. 
But that is hard. It is hard for me, 
and I imagine it is hard for you. Con-
gressman John Robert Lewis was more 
than an icon; he was a real person, per-
fect in his imperfections, and I will 
miss him dearly. 
f 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OF THE 
LEFTIST MOB 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from Pennsylvania respon-
sibly and carefully sanitized the po-
dium up here before I began my 5- 
minute remarks, but I will tell you 
that there is not enough disinfectant in 
all of the District of Columbia to sani-
tize this Chamber on account of my 
Democrat colleagues who fail to con-
demn what has been going on in what 
once 
were 
great 
American 
cities 
throughout this Nation. It is shameful, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Leaders are elected to this great 
body with its history and with the full 
confidence of the American people that 
we will call evil by its name. But they 
sit idly by and are complicit in their si-
lence and do not condemn the chaos, 
the 
destruction, 
the 
violence, 
the 
crimes, and the terrorism that is rav-
aging our Nation. 
As we speak and as we sit in this 
quiet and peaceful Chamber, there are 
citizens—our fellow Americans—who 
feel that their lives and their private 
property are threatened. They can’t 
even bear arms with their constitu-
tional right to protect themselves and 
their property without being pros-
ecuted by some rogue city attorney. 
We have got to stand up to this mob. 
We have to say: No more will you burn 
our cities; no more will you terrorize 
our communities and intimidate and 
use fear to squelch any attempt by our 
local leaders to stop this now. 
But they are intimidated, Mr. Speak-
er. The local leaders have completely 
bowed the knee to these leftist extrem-
ist groups that have hijacked peaceful 
protest. 
There are folks with righteous indig-
nation who have taken to the streets 
to speak their truth to power, and I re-
spect that. God bless them. That is the 
American way. 
We just celebrated one of the great-
est who demonstrated peacefully and, 
through love for his country and his 
fellow man, made more difference than 
1 million mobs could have. His name is 
John Lewis, and I am honored to have 
served with him. 
But what is happening right now is 
these local leaders are either unwilling 
or incapable of stopping it. This week-
end was 2 months of persistence in this 
violence and in the crimes perpetrated 
against Federal officers and local law 
enforcement who have been hamstrung 
to even defend themselves, let alone 
the property that they have been asked 
by their ‘‘courageous leaders’’ to de-
fend. They are getting fireworks shot 
off in their face. 
Where are the city leaders? 
Where is Mr. Biden? He is safe in his 
basement. That is courageous leader-
ship? That is what America needs right 
now? 
Criticize President Trump all you 
want. He is at least doing something to 
stand up to the mob and protect tax-
payers’ Federal property. 
Our Federal law enforcement officers 
are doing their job faithfully and duti-
fully while our citizens’ rights are 
being completely trampled. There is no 
pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness in 
these cities. They are burning. 
Protesters in California set fire to a 
courthouse, damaged police stations, 
and assaulted officers, ABC says: ‘‘in 
peaceful demonstrations that have in-
tensified.’’ 
Are you kidding me? In Texas, we 
call it bull with the end of that word 
with a T. 
Mr. Speaker, you know it. You know 
that these things are happening, and 
they wouldn’t happen in parts of Texas 
because the citizens would not allow it. 
What do we do with fireworks, bro-
ken windows, spray paint, and lasers 
being shot at them? 
Seattle experienced an antipolice 
riot where 59 police officers were in-
jured by arson, vandalism, and assault. 
I have got the list of Federal crimes 
right here. These people ought to be 
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the 
law. They should be locked up away 
from the citizens who are just trying to 
live out their lives in this great Na-
tion. 
These are the Federal crimes: advo-
cating to overthrow the government, 
aggravated assault and battery, arson, 
assault with a deadly weapon, attempt-
ing to kill an officer, conspiracy to im-
pede or injure an officer, and demands 
against the U.S. 
This is domestic terrorism as defined 
by the statutes that we stand on and 
that we have debated. They say that 
domestic terrorism is violent crimes. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to respect 
that you gaveled me out because I re-
spect the rules of this Chamber, so I 
thank you for the indulgence.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE 
AMERICAN LATINO ACT 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2420) to establish within the 
Smithsonian Institution the National 
Museum of the American Latino, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2420 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National 
Museum of the American Latino Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States is a symbol of democ-
racy, freedom, and economic opportunity 
around the world, and the legacy of Latinos 
is deeply rooted in the very fabric of the his-
tory, democracy, freedom, and economic op-
portunity of the United States. 
(2) There exists no national museum with-
in the Smithsonian Institution that is de-
voted to the documentation and explication 
of Latino life, art, history, and culture. 
(3) The establishment of the National Mu-
seum of the American Latino will be con-
sistent with the purposes of the Smithsonian 
Institution, created by Congress in 1846, ‘‘for 
the increase and diffusion of knowledge’’. 
(4) The National Museum of the American 
Latino— 
(A) will be the keystone for people in the 
United States and other Smithsonian Insti-
tution visitors to learn about Latino con-
tributions to life, art, history, and culture in 
the United States at its signature location 
on the National Mall; and 
(B) will serve as a gateway for visitors to 
view other Latino exhibitions, collections, 
and programming at other Smithsonian In-
stitution facilities and museums throughout 
the United States and the territories of the 
United States. 
SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

(1) to illuminate the story of the United 
States for the benefit of all by featuring 
Latino contributions; and 
(2) to provide for— 
(A) the collection, study, research, publica-

ant to the rule, the gentleman from

RODNEY 
DAVIS) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to insert extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 2420. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, this bill and the cre-
ation of the National Museum of the 
American Latino has traveled a long 
road, stretching back to 1994 and, legis-
latively, back to 2003, 17 years ago. 
In 1994, the Smithsonian Institution 
Task Force on Latino Issues issued a 
report, titled, ‘‘Willful Neglect: The 
Smithsonian 
Institution 
and 
U.S. 
Latinos.’’ This report concluded that 
‘‘because of both indigenous roots and 
Spanish heritage, Latinos predate the 
British in the Americas. They have 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
every 
phase and aspect of American history 
and culture. Yet the Smithsonian In-
stitution almost entirely excludes and 
ignores Latinos in nearly every aspect 
of its operations.’’ 
In 2003, our former colleague Rep-
resentative Xavier Becerra introduced 
a bill to establish a Commission to 
Study the Potential Creation of the 
National Museum of the American 
Latino. 
Language 
establishing 
this 
Commission was finally enacted in 
2008. 
In 2011, the Commission to Study the 
Potential Creation of the National Mu-
seum of the American Latino issued its 
report. The Commission reported that 
‘‘the time has come for the creation of 
the new museum on The National 
Mall’’ that ‘‘reflects the contributions 
of Latinos in every aspect of American 
history and culture.’’ 
Since then, our colleague, Represent-
ative JOSE´ SERRANO, has carried this 
legislation, and fought tirelessly to en-
sure American Latinos, our history, 
our culture, and our contributions to 
this Nation are recognized on The Na-
tional Mall. 
Representative SERRANO has spent a 
career championing the civil rights and 
civil liberties of all Americans; first, in 
the New York State Assembly, where 
he served for 16 years, and then in the 
House, where he served for 30 years. He 
has educated us on everything from 
Puerto Rico to New York, to the story 
of American Latinos, to, yes, a little 
bit of Sinatra, too. 
I remember a committee hearing last 
year, 
shortly 
after 
Representative 
SERRANO
announced his retirement, 
where he told the committee: ‘‘If you 
want to give me a going away present 
that I will cherish forever, give me a 
museum.’’ 
It is true that there are plans to open 
the Molina Family Latino Gallery at 
the American History Museum, which 
is a step in the right direction. But to 
once 
again 
quote 
Representative 
SERRANO: ‘‘No matter how hard we try, 
hundreds of years of history, art, and 
culture cannot be contained in one 
4,500-square-foot exhibit. We deserve a 
dedicated museum of our own in the 
heart of Washington, D.C. We need a 
Latino Museum.’’ 
Mr. SERRANO
is right: We need a 
Latino Museum. 
H.R. 2420 follows the plan for the cre-
ation of the National Museum of Afri-
can American History and Culture. It 
would establish the position of direc-
tor, as well as board of trustees, and 
follows 
the 
successful 
cost-sharing 
framework of the National Museum of 
African American History and Culture 
by providing for a 50/50 split between 
Federal and non-Federal funds in con-
structing the museum and support fa-
cilities. 
Let me remind my colleagues of the 
history of the National Museum of Af-
rican American History and Culture, 
which opened in 2016. This history 
stretches back to 1988, 28 long years. 
And it took 16 years since the legisla-
tion establishing the museum for the 
museum to open its doors. 
Passage of this bill today is not the 
first step in realizing the creation of 
the National Museum of the American 
Latino, nor is it the final step, but it is 
an important milestone on a decades’- 
long journey and the culmination of 
years of effort and advocacy by Rep-
resentative SERRANO, my Hispanic Cau-
cus colleagues, and countless outside 
advocates. 
The Latino community represents 
one-sixth of the American population. 
Latinos are an integral part of our his-
tory and culture and have been at the 
center of American progress for genera-
tions. And yet, study after study has 
shown that the story of this commu-
nity within the broader scope of Amer-
ican history has not been told. 
Passage of H.R. 2420 brings us closer 
to being able to tell this story, a story 
intertwined with the very history of 
our country. This is a story that de-
serves to be honored and recognized. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this H.R. 2420, and 
for my colleagues in the Senate to pass 
it quickly and send it to the President 
for his signature so that we can begin 
the journey of realizing this important 
addition to the story of all Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

sulted and involved as the bill or similar leg-
islation moves forward so that we may ad-
dress any remaining issues within our juris-

garding this legislation and look forward to

DEAR CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 2420, the National 
Museum of the American Latino Act. This

sions that fall within the jurisdiction of the

ciate your Committee’s willingness to be dis-
charged from further consideration of H.R.

Hon. ZOE LOFGREN, 
Chairperson, Committee on House Administra-

DC. 
DEAR CHAIRPERSON LOFGREN: I write con-
cerning H.R. 2420, the National Museum of 
the American Latino Act. There are certain 
provisions in this legislation that fall within

In order to expedite floor consideration of 
H.R. 2420, the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure agrees to forgo action on 
the bill. However, this is conditional on our 
mutual understanding that forgoing consid-
eration of the bill would not prejudice the 
Committee with respect to the appointment 
of conferees or to any future jurisdictional

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, 
Washington, DC, June 24, 2020. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DEFAZIO: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 2420, the National 
Museum of the American Latino Act. This 
bill was referred primarily to the Committee 
on House Administration, with additional re-
ferrals to the Committee on Natural Re-
sources and the Committee on Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure. 
I recognize that this bill contains provi-
sions that fall within the jurisdiction of the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure. I appreciate your Committee’s 
willingness to be discharged from further 
consideration of H.R. 2420 and acknowledge 
that this discharge is not a waiver of future 
jurisdictional claims by the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure over this 
subject matter and will not prejudice your 
Committee with respect to the appointment 
of conferees if this were to be necessary. 
I would be pleased to include your letter 
and this response in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of H.R. 
2420. 
Sincerely, 
ZOE LOFGREN, 
Chairperson. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I, too, agree with my friend from 
California: Mr. SERRANO
was right. 
This is something we need to do. 
And I will probably catch some flack 
for it later from him, but I have to say 
Mr. AGUILAR is correct: We ought to do 
something to honor the Latino commu-
nity that has made our country the 
greatest country in the history of the 
world. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to sup-
port the underlying legislation that 
would create the first Smithsonian mu-
seum honoring Latinos. Again, our 
country would not be what it is today 
without their contributions. 
More than 18 percent of our popu-
lation is Latino. Sixteen percent of the 
men and women serving in our military 
heroically are Latino. You don’t have 
to look too far to see their contribu-
tion to the brave men and women in 
our police forces throughout this Na-
tion. Also, every essential workforce 
that we see in America today is popu-
lated 
with 
hardworking 
American 
Latinos. I would also be remiss if I 
didn’t mention, of course, a third of 
Major League Baseball players are 
Latino. 
And, unfortunately, we are not going 
to get to see who would win the Con-
gressional Baseball Game this year. I 
think it was our year; I truly do. And 
I do certainly miss being able to jaw 
with my good friends, Mr. AGUILAR and 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS, while they came up to 
the plate while I was playing catcher in 
that game. And I will tell you, the 
Latino contribution to Congressional 
baseball has led to many more vic-
tories than I would have liked, because 
I would like to win again this year. 
Earlier this year, the House Adminis-
tration Committee had a hearing on 
the possibility of creating this museum 
to specifically honor Latinos. This was 
an important step that hasn’t been 
done on other issues that we face in 
this Congress, because hearings give us 
an opportunity to ask important ques-
tions about the complexities of cre-
ating a world-class museum. And I am, 
again, glad Chairperson LOFGREN led 
the effort in getting this done. 
At the hearing, we discussed the 
Smithsonian’s 
current 
struggles 
in 
handling the maintenance of their nu-
merous facilities. In fact, Chairperson 
LOFGREN and I sent a letter last fall to 
appropriators asking for robust funding 
to address the Smithsonian’s current 
maintenance and repair needs, which 
have now reached nearly $1 billion. 
The lack of upkeep has led to dam-
aged collections and building closures. 
It is concerning to me to hear how 
much the Smithsonian is struggling to 
take care of their current facilities, 
not to mention the possibility of cre-
ating new ones. 
This brings me to another concern: 
the cost of a new museum. And the 
most recent Smithsonian museum con-
structed, the National Museum of Afri-
can American History and Culture, 
truly a work of art and history, cost 
$555 million. That was nearly $200 mil-
lion more than the Commission esti-
mated. 
Given 
the 
current 
billion-dollar 
backlog, costs are always important to 
consider, particularly as we envision 
what museums will look like in a post- 
pandemic America. I bring these costs 
up, not to say this is an impossible 
task ahead of us; it is to make sure 
that we learn from the mistakes of the 
previous cultural giants like the last 
museum that was built. As we look at 
the contributions of Latinos, we need 
to be realistic about the current re-
straints of the Smithsonian. 
Additionally, I am glad this legisla-
tion includes a provision requiring all 
political viewpoints to be represented, 
because I believe it is important we re-
spect our diversity and all cultures 
throughout 
the 
Smithsonian. 
No 
Smithsonian, no museum in America, 
should put a political litmus test on 
what Americans get to learn from. This 
is what makes our country great. 
Madam Speaker, I hope the Smithso-
nian Institute takes my concerns seri-
ously as this great initiative moves 
forward, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CA´ RDENAS), a strong 
supporter of the legislation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I also yield 2 minutes 
to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CA´ RDENAS). 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, it 
is unusual, but look at this bipartisan 
effort together here. This is an amaz-
ing moment. 
As mentioned, our colleague, JOSE´ 
SERRANO, has been a champion on this 
cause for many years, and I miss him 
dearly, and I look forward to seeing 
him very, very soon. 
There are more than 58 million rea-
sons why we need a National Museum 
of the American Latino: 
Since the founding of our great Na-
tion, Latinos have been largely invis-
ible and excluded from the history 
books. 
Our community has been used as 
scapegoats for the problems America 
faces. 
We are looked at as ‘‘others,’’ and 
have been made to feel like outsiders 
in our own country.

The root of this problem stems from 
a lack of knowledge of and apprecia-
tion for Latino contributions to Amer-
ica’s success. 
Now, more than ever, when Latinos 
are being vilified and spoken of as ‘‘less 
than,’’ the American people deserve to 
learn the truth of our history and our 
heritage. The American Latino Mu-
seum is essential to sharing the stories 
and the journey of Latinos in America. 
From America’s original sin of Native 
American genocide, the American Civil 
War, and through the civil rights 
movement, to the horrors of the deadly 
El Paso shooting, where 23 people were 
killed at the hands of a murderer who 
drove hundreds of miles with the sole 
intent of killing as many Mexicans as 
possible; we must teach our entire his-
tory, the beautiful, the glorious, and 
the horrors and the injustices. Our 
story is the story of the United States 
of America. 
If we truly want to build a country 
that works for everyone, we must start 
by including everyone. We owe it to 
ourselves and our children to learn 
about Latino history in America. That 
is exactly what museums are for: To 
teach and inspire. And for years, I, 
along with Congressmembers SERRANO, 
HURD, 
SA´ NCHEZ, 
ROYBAL-ALLARD, 
AGUILAR and many others have worked 
tirelessly to gain bipartisan support in 
finally establishing a Latino Museum. 
We understand its symbolic and histor-
ical significance for our country. 
Latinos make up 17 percent—more 
than 58 million people—of the United 
States population, and they are the 
largest and fastest growing ethnic 
group in America. Hispanic Americans 
contribute more than $2.3 trillion to 
the United States economy every year. 
That GDP would make itself a country 
of the eighth largest economy in the 
world. People like my brother-in-law 
who was born in Mexico, served in the 
United States Army, and was shot and 
wounded while fighting for our country 
in Vietnam. His story deserves to be 
heard. Today, there are more than 
200,000 Hispanic Active-Duty service-
members serving in the United States 
Armed Forces. Sixty Hispanic Ameri-
cans have received the Congressional 
Medal of Honor, the highest award for 
valor in action against an enemy force 
that can be bestowed on an individual 
serving in the Armed Forces of the 
United States of America. 
Our story is America’s story, and 
Latino history is American history. 
Latino leaders were key players during 
the U.S. civil rights movement. Histor-
ical movements like the Chicano civil 
rights and labor movements, which in-
cluded some of the largest student 
walkouts in American history, are not 
taught in our classrooms. Americans 
like Dolores Huerta, who was beaten 
within an inch of her life, and Navy 
veteran Cesar Chavez, have been in-
strumental in securing American work-
ers’ rights. In the face of relentless 
brutality and adversity, Huerta and 
Chavez remained committed to non-
violence 
while 
fighting 
for 
farm-
workers’ rights, workers who were 
maimed or died while working in the 
fields and cast aside like forgotten 
fruit by farmowners. Dolores and Cesar 
prevailed by establishing the first 
farmworkers 
union 
in 
the 
United 
States, forever changing the course of 
this Nation for the better. 
There are countless stories of Amer-
ican Latinos; stories of perseverance, 
dedication, and beating the odds to 
achieve their dreams; like the story of 
my friend and astronaut Jose Her-
nandez. Jose grew up in a poor farm-
worker family. As a child, he would 
work in the fields before sunrise and 
look up at the stars, dreaming of going 
to space. Jose followed that dream 
through his college career as a sci-
entist and engineer. His journey took 
him from the fields of California as a 
farmworker to the NASA space pro-
gram. Jose applied to the NASA space 
program 13 times, to be rejected 12 
times. After his thirteenth attempt, he 
was finally accepted into the program 
and fulfilled his childhood dream, be-
coming the first astronaut to commu-
nicate back to Earth in Spanish from 
space. Jose’s story is a story of perse-
verance, dedication, and unshakeable 
will. Jose’s inspiring story deserves to 
be heard and shared so that every 
child, regardless of race or personal 
circumstances, can achieve his or her 
dreams. Like little Joaquin, or Jimena, 
or little Sky, or little Sage; they de-
serve those inspirations to see some-
body who looks like them achieve their 
dreams. 
A National Latino Museum is a fit-
ting and appropriate way for all Ameri-
cans to celebrate and learn the truth 
about how Latinos have contributed to 
our great country; to honor Latinos 
who are on the frontlines and who, lit-
erally, gave their lives in service of our 
Nation. A Smithsonian museum dedi-
cated to Latino history and culture 
would educate the American public on 
the stories of American Latinos that 
are 
excluded 
from 
our 
museums, 
schools, and history books. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
30 seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia. 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, it 
is time we establish a national museum 
devoted to American Latino history 
and culture. We are a great Nation, but 
this Nation is incomplete without giv-
ing the honor and respect that every 
single community deserves. 
I thank my colleagues for this oppor-
tunity to share this beautiful moment 
with all of America so that we can 
make this museum real. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. HERRERA
BEUTLER), the Latino 
leader in the Republican Conference 
and the ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Legislative Branch Ap-
propriations. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
I rise today in support of the Na-
tional Museum of the American Latino 
Act. 
The National Mall is the most-visited 
national park, with over 25 million 
visitors each year. It is nicknamed 
‘‘America’s front yard.’’ It is a testa-
ment to the accomplishments, history, 
and diversity of the people that make 
up these United States of America. 
However, there are almost 60 million 
Americans whose stories, contribu-
tions, and traditions do not have a 
platform or a spotlight here. Millions 
of us, both Mexican Americans like me, 
and people of other heritages, value 
those contributions to our Union and 
want to see that platform become part 
of our country’s message. 
Let me say, I so believe this spotlight 
needs to happen, in part, because my 
generation of Hispanics, we didn’t have 
the Spanish language passed on to us, 
in part, because it wasn’t popular to 
tout that. Now, more than ever, most 
of us have had to learn it through 
things like wonderful products, or in 
college, or in high school, which is awe-
some; but I want to see that pride of 
passing that language down and pre-
serving the culture, as it is an Amer-
ican culture; and what better oppor-
tunity would we have than to highlight 
it here in America’s front yard. 
The story of the American Latino is 
woven into the fabric of this Nation. 
Latinos have fought in every U.S. war 
since the American Revolution and set-
tled in parts of the United States be-
fore the arrival of Pilgrims at Plym-
outh Rock. 
Latinos are a crucial part of the 
American identity. There are those of 
us who have explored space, like astro-
naut Ellen Ochoa. We’ve brought inno-
vation to the world, like inventor 
Elena Medo. We have done things that 
few other athletes in the world could 
do, like baseball legend Edgar Martinez 
of my home State in Washington, the 
Seattle Mariners. And I am proud to 
note personally that we have helped 
shape our Nation’s laws by serving in 
Congress. 
I have had the amazing opportunity 
to be the first and only Hispanic Mem-
ber of Congress, House or Senate, to 
have served from Washington State. I 
would like to highlight that it was my 
predominantly White, smaller corner 
of what I will call the best part of the 
Pacific Northwest that bestowed upon 
me this amazing honor. 
Hispanic Americans represent the 
heart of the American Dream: Strong 
family values, amazing work ethic, 
strong faith in community and in 
civics. My first or second term here I 
remember walking down the National 
Mall and seeing a protest, and it was a 
very peaceful protest, unlike some that 
I have seen. It was families, and they 
were walking side-by-side, and they

were wrapping themselves in the Amer-
ican flag. To me, they represent the 
best of us. 
I look forward to visiting the Na-
tional Museum of the American Latino 
and sharing these stories with my chil-
dren, these American stories. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this legislation. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA), a key advo-
cate and champion of this legislation, 
and chairman of the Natural Resources 
Committee. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding to 
give me an opportunity to speak on be-
half of H.R. 2420, legislation introduced 
by our esteemed friend and colleague, 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
SERRANO), a pioneer and a powerful ad-
vocate for Latino people in his time in 
this Congress. And the whole Nation, 
all Americans have benefited from his 
work, and we are all grateful for what 
he has done for many people in this 
country. 
I have a brief story. You will hear a 
lot about the statistical importance 
and the history that needs to be told, 
but I have a brief story. You know, I 
am a first-generation American cit-
izen. My parents migrated and immi-
grated into this country with the dis-
tinct goal of giving their kids a chance. 
And to that end, they did. But, see, my 
story is not unique, nor is it, for that 
matter, extraordinary. It is the story 
that binds all the diversity of Latinos 
together, a shared experience and a 
shared demand for respect, fairness, 
and to be treated as equals. 
The Latino Museum, this vote, comes 
at a time of forced divisions in this 
country, attempts to demonize and 
marginalize Latinos by the highest 
voice in this land. Our American his-
tory and identity are also Latino his-
tory and identity and, through this his-
tory, the United States exists. 
Latino history, like American his-
tory, is ongoing, it is evolving, but to 
tell the full stories, the scars, the cur-
rent wounds, the changes, the unsung 
leaders in all arenas, with that story 
also comes hope. And today and tomor-
row, as we honor our great friend and 
leader and beacon, John Lewis, here at 
the Capitol, for being the person that 
he was, and a great American—you 
know, my proudest moment and privi-
lege was to be arrested with him in a 
civil disobedience protest on behalf of 
immigrants, 
DACA 
recipients, 
and 
their families. 
So today, we are voting for 2420, and 
we are saying ‘‘yes’’ to the Latino Mu-
seum, but I think, more importantly, 
this ‘‘yes’’ vote by Congress is also a 
vote that extends respect, provides ac-
knowledgment, provides equity, and 
begins to tell the story of all Ameri-
cans in this country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this legislation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD), 
my good friend, a gentleman who has 
been leading on Latino issues in our 
Republican Conference, and someone 
who bravely served our country in the 
CIA, but also, will be greatly missed in 
this institution. 
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Latinos became the largest ethnic 
group in the United States in 2008 and, 
well before 2060, will make up 25 per-
cent of the American population. In 
spite of their essential relevance to our 
country’s intellectual and cultural life, 
the task force that the gentleman from 
California spoke about that was com-
missioned in 1994 by the secretary of 
the 
Smithsonian 
Institution 
found 
that, ‘‘U.S. Latinos and Latinas are the 
only major contributor to American 
civilization still uncelebrated by any 
specific, systemic, permanent effort in 
this country’s major cultural institu-
tion.’’ We are rectifying this situation 
today. 
The National Mall is America’s front 
yard, and it draws millions of visitors 
every year to some of the best muse-
ums and monuments that honor our 
most revered citizens. Half of all Amer-
icans will visit the National Mall in 
their lifetime, but there is nothing to 
the American Latino. To fully under-
stand American history, we need a mu-
seum for the American Latino and 
Latina. 
Historian Dr. Peter Stearns has said: 
‘‘History helps us understand people 
and societies, helps us understand 
change and how the society we live in 
came to be. History contributes to 
moral understanding, provides iden-
tity, and studying it is essential for 
good citizenship.’’ At a time of intense 
public debate about whitewashing his-
tory, we should jump at the chance to 
collect, present, and protect in one 
place artifacts, stories, and collections 
that reflect our entire history. 
The National Museum of African 
American History and Culture had one 
million visitors in its first 4 months. If 
this is any indication of the potential 
success for a museum of the American 
Latino, this investment will be well 
worth it. 
Many incredible people have fought 
to bring to life the idea of a national 
museum for the American Latino. 
Robert McCormick Adams, secretary 
of the Smithsonian Institution, com-
missioned the 1994 task force. 
Raul Yzaguirre chaired the task 
force, with his vice chair Mari Carmen, 
and they have been fighting for this 
museum for 25 years. 
In 2004, my friend and former col-
league, 
Ileana 
Ros-Lehtinen, 
along 
with another former colleague, Xavier 
Becerra, first introduced legislation to 
establish the museum. 
Henry Munoz, a fellow San Antonian, 
served faithfully as chairman for the 
National Museum of the American 
Latino Commission with his vice chair, 
Susan Gonzales from California. They 
authored a report on how to achieve 
this vision. 
And another organization critical to 
the success of this initiative, Friends 
of the American Latino, whose chair, 
Danny 
Vargas, 
vice 
chair, 
Ivette 
Fernandez, and CEO, Estuardo Rodri-
guez, have toiled to make this a re-
ality. 
Today, Congress gets to fulfill the 
work of these folks and many more. If 
we want to understand this experiment 
we call America, then we must under-
stand ourselves, and we can’t do that 
unless we understand all of our Na-
tion’s history. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this landmark piece of legislation. I 
am proud to associate my name with 
Ranking Member DAVIS, who has been 
a champion of this, to see this go to 
fruition, and the distinguished gentle-
men from California (Mr. AGUILAR), my 
good friend, and the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CA´ RDENAS), and, of 
course, the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. SERRANO). 
b 1030 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the majority 
leader of our Caucus and an incredible 
advocate and supporter for years of 
this piece of legislation. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I join my colleague, Mr. AGUILAR, 
and I thank him and Mr. DAVIS for 
bringing this to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I echo but I will not 
repeat all the words of the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. HURD), who has been a 
real leader in this House. I thank him 
for his remarks and his acknowledg-
ment of the importance of the Latina 
and Latino population to our country 
and the contributions they have made. 
Madam Speaker, I want to rise and 
thank Representative SERRANO and the 
Congressional 
Hispanic 
Caucus 
for 
leading this effort. 
As the Speaker knows, Mr. SERRANO 
is one of my closest friends. The dean 
of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus 
has been one of the most effective and 
hardworking Members of this House, 
and he will be missed next year when 
he retires after 30 years representing 
New Yorkers. He has been and will con-
tinue to be a dear, dear friend. 
This is also a very meaningful day 
for all the members of the Hispanic 
Caucus, including our colleague and 
friend, Representative LUCILLE
ROY-
BAL-ALLARD, whose father, Ed Roybal, 
was a dear friend of mine and on whose 
committee I served, and who was the 
founder of the caucus, with others. It 
started with five members in 1976. 
Today, it has 38 members. 
I am proud to join Representative 
SERRANO
and the Congressional His-
panic Caucus on this bill and bring it 
to the floor today. 
For more than 500 years, half a mil-
lennium, Latinos have been a part of 
our American story. Through medicine, 
education, innovation, public service, 
the military, athletics, and the arts,

Latinos and Latinas have strengthened 
our economy, enriched our heritage, 
and have made America a safer and 
more prosperous Nation. 
The story of America is incomplete 
without the story of the American 
Latino. 
That is why a national museum of 
the American Latino is so critical and 
appropriate. I know that it will be a 
wonderful addition to the Smithsonian 
Institution and our National Mall. 
At a time, Madam Speaker, when 
many people, including in our govern-
ment at the highest levels, denigrate, 
discriminate, and target Latinos, we 
need this museum to recognize the 
service and the extraordinary assets 
that 
the 
Latino 
community 
has 
brought to America. 
I hope my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle will join me in supporting this 
bill, as I believe they will. 
I look forward to the day when we 
can walk through the doors of the 
Smithsonian’s newest museum and ex-
perience the full richness and diversity 
of Latino cultures and how they have 
helped to make America great. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
would inquire how much time remains 
on each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR) 
has 81⁄2 minutes remaining. The gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
RODNEY 
DAVIS) has 7 minutes remaining. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. AGUILAR and Ranking Mem-
ber DAVIS for their work in bringing 
this bill to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the National Museum of the 
American Latino Act, this bipartisan 
legislation that would establish a new 
museum at the Smithsonian to share 
the Latino American experience, not 
just with the Nation, but with the 
world, an experience that we know all 
too well in my district on the central 
coast of California, an experience that 
has not been told enough, but one this 
country is somewhat familiar with, 
sacrificing so much to come to this 
country to give their children better 
lives, living the American Dream, but 
by doing so, contributing so much, not 
just to their families, but to our cul-
ture, to our economy, and, of course, 
our communities. 
By fighting for security abroad in all 
American wars, to fighting for dignity 
at home in the grape wars, to influ-
encing our arts, our agriculture, our 
sciences, and sports, the contributions 
Latinos have made to American cul-
ture and history are innumerable and 
must always be told. 
I say this not just because it is de-
served; I say this because Latino his-
tory is our history. That is why the 
Latino experience should be captured, 
portrayed, and highlighted in our Na-
tion’s museum at the Smithsonian. 
I look forward to voting on this bi-
partisan bill and watching this pass on 
a bipartisan basis. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, first, I want to thank the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR), 
and all those founding mothers and fa-
thers who, many years ago, thought 
about this museum and how important 
it would be to add to the fabric of our 
country in our own backyard, an Amer-
ican Latino museum. 
I stand here today, proudly, because I 
still remember in 2014 hosting a recep-
tion for the museum to try to raise 
money, to try to raise awareness, to 
make sure that people understood why 
it was so needed. 
So, I stand proudly today to support 
this bill, because, as Latinos, 60 million 
strong and growing, we have a place to 
be, and that is in the museum. 
Latinos contribute billions to our 
economy and are starting more small 
businesses than any group, and during 
this pandemic, we have worked essen-
tial jobs that have kept our country 
moving forward. 
It is time for Latinos to see our con-
tributions, our culture, and our history 
reflected in all institutions, including 
the Smithsonian museums. 
More importantly, it is time for our 
children to come to a museum and see 
the stories of their own heritage, their 
own culture, and their own language. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues, Democrats and Republicans, 
to support this very important bill. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Latino history is American history. 
Nuestra historia es historia Ameri-
cana. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a mem-
ber of the Judiciary Committee and a 
key advocate for civil rights. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlemen for allowing me 
the privilege of joining my brothers 
and sisters in the Hispanic Caucus for 
really a moment of history in this his-
toric legislation authored by our dear 
friend, Congressman SERRANO
from 
New York, the National Museum of the 
American Latino Act. 
Madam Speaker, I have watched Con-
gressman SERRANO for all the years 
that he has served, and I do want to 
take this moment to say what an honor 
to have been able to serve with him. 
He walked among giants as a civil 
rights activist in this Congress. You 
could always count on his voice for up-
holding civil rights and justice, and his 
leadership on the Commerce, Justice, 
Science, and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Subcommittee is well evi-
dent. I thank him again for his leader-
ship. 
In the opening findings of this legis-
lation, it says: ‘‘The United States is a 
symbol of democracy, freedom, and 
economic 
opportunity 
around 
the 
world, and the legacy of Latinos is 
deeply rooted in the very fabric of the 
history, democracy, freedom, and eco-
nomic 
opportunity 
of 
the 
United 
States.’’ 
It is long overdue for our memory to 
be able to reflect that that is true 
across this Nation. 
I have had the privilege in Texas to 
count as some very dear friends the en-
tire Hispanic-Latin community, and it 
is in their name so many heroes and 
sheroes in our community walked 
alongside so many of us for justice of 
any kind. 
I have had the privilege of going with 
members of the Hispanic Caucus to 
fight against the devastation and das-
tardly acts of children in cages and 
human 
beings 
in 
cages 
and 
dis-
respecting those who would want to be 
equal in this Nation. 
In addition, I have seen the soldiers 
in Iraq and Afghanistan who wore the 
uniform whose family members were 
yet not citizens of the United States. 
I fight along with my brothers and 
sisters against the dastardly act of this 
administration to not count undocu-
mented persons. 
We know that this Nation 
was 
formed in the Constitution by the 
words to ‘‘form a more perfect Union.’’ 
How do you have a perfect Union 
without the historic recognition of the 
Latino community and how they built 
the pillars of this Nation? 
Let me say how exciting it will be for 
children and others to be able to come 
there. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for this legislation having 
scholarship opportunities for African 
Americans, Hispanics, and others to do 
their work in the arts. 
I want to conclude my remarks by 
highlighting the respect and friendship 
of Caesar Chavez and Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King. I do that in the recognition 
of my good friend Dolores Huerta, as 
well, who was mentioned previously. 
What a fighter for justice. What a tra-
ditional mother, if you will, in her 
fight and embracing the fight. She 
never gave up and never gave in. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
30 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding me 
the additional time. 
These words are from Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King: ‘‘I am deeply moved by your

courage in fasting as your personal sac-
rifice for justice through nonviolence. 
Your past and present commitment is 
eloquent testimony to the constructive 
power of nonviolent action and the de-
structive impotence of violent reprisal. 
You stand today as a living example of 
the Gandhian tradition with its great 
force for social progress.’’ 
They never met, but I honor both of 
them, and I honor this museum. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
men for giving me the opportunity to 
speak, and I ask for support of the leg-
islation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CISNEROS). 
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the National Museum of the 
American Latino Act. 
The Latino community has and con-
tinues to play a pivotal role in the 
growth and success of the United 
States. For hundreds of years, Latinos 
have been at the forefront of the fight 
for justice, equality, and opportunity, 
breaking barriers and advancing rights 
for all Americans. 
In Orange County, in the 1940s, five 
Mexican-American families challenged 
school segregation. In the landmark 
case of Mendez v. Westminster, they 
paved 
the 
way 
for 
desegregating 
schools in California. It influenced the 
historic Brown v. Board of Education 
ruling 7 years later. 
People should know this story. From 
education to science and politics to 
art, Latinos and Latinas have been pio-
neers, leaders, innovators, and game 
changers. Latino history is American 
history. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Representative 
SERRANO
for 
cham-
pioning this cause. It deserves a place 
on The National Mall. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in support of the National 
Museum of the American Latino Act. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CUELLAR), another strong 
advocate of the legislation. 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I also rise in support of H.R. 2420 for 
several reasons. 
If you look at the impact of the His-
panic culture here in the United 
States, all you have to do is go back. 
The first language that was ever spo-
ken in the United States, a European 
language, was Spanish. 
The first settlement in the United 
States was St. Augustine, Florida. 
And if you look at the impact that 
the Spanish culture has had on the 
U.S., all you have to do is look at the 
State symbols like the State coats of 
arms, seals, and flags, and you will see 
that the coats of arms and the flags of 
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, 
Montana, New Mexico, Texas, Puerto 
Rico, Los Angeles, Santa Fe, St. Louis, 
San Diego, Baton Rouge, Riverside, 
Pensacola, Cupertino, and St. Augus-
tine all have the symbol. 
Finally, let me just say this as I 
close. Even the U.S. dollar has had an 
impact. When the Spanish explorers de-
veloped settlements in the United 
States, they brought along the trading 
coins, or Spanish dollars, that were 
used regularly by the people in that re-
gion. 
b 1045 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman 
from Texas an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, in 
1775, the Spanish dollar was announced 
as the first currency with legal use in 
the United States, and this was ap-
proved by the Continental Congress, 
suggested by Thomas Jefferson. 
The design of the American dollar in 
1792 was based off its Spanish counter-
part. All you have to do is look at the 
dollar sign, and you will see the Span-
ish influence. 
Again, the Spanish culture has had 
an influence, and I certainly ask all 
Members to support this legislation. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to support this legisla-
tion—long overdue. 
I 
want 
to 
say 
to 
Congressman 
SERRANO how I have witnessed his per-
sistence and his commitment, and I 
want to thank the gentleman so much 
for finally getting this bill to the floor 
and making it a bipartisan bill. 
I was born and raised, of course, in El 
Paso, Texas, and the wonderful history 
of our Latino community finally now, 
as a result of this bill, will be brought 
forth for the American public and real-
ly for the public and for the world to 
see and recognize and lift up. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to say to 
Congressman SERRANO, and to all of 
those who are supporting this, that the 
beauty of diversity in this country is 
what makes America America. This is 
another step toward achieving that 
perfect Union. All of our young people, 
everyone throughout the world, need to 
understand the history and the herit-
age of the Latino community. 
To think that it is going to be now 
part of the Smithsonian on The Mall is 
just really exciting, and I hope we pass 
this today in a bipartisan way. 
I want to thank all of you and thank 
Congressman SERRANO for giving us the 
privilege to support such a historic ef-
fort. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I want to begin by thanking Con-
gressman SERRANO for his persistent 
leadership on this issue, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation 
in a very strong bipartisan vote. 
It is important we celebrate and un-
derstand the history of the Latino 
community in this country and the 
contributions they have made since the 
very beginning of this country and con-
tinue to make today. 
I come from a State, the State of 
Rhode Island, where a very diverse and 
vibrant Latino community has made 
an extraordinary difference in the 
State of Rhode Island. We have leaders 
from the Latino community in busi-
ness, in the arts, in politics, and in 
education. We have been blessed in so 
many ways by the extraordinary con-
tributions of Latinos in Rhode Island 
and all throughout our country. 
This is a wonderful way to celebrate 
that history and honor this great com-
munity. I urge everyone to support the 
bill. 
Muchisimas gracias a todos. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to be 
here to support this project; it is an 
honor to be able to stand here with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle; 
and it is an honor to give as much time 
as he may consume to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. HURD), my good friend, 
so that he can close out this debate on 
our side. 
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
at a time with incredibly divisive poli-
tics, we are showing that we can actu-
ally come together for the betterment 
of our society as a whole. 
The fact that there have been folks 
from well over a quarter of a century 
fighting and toiling to make this a re-
ality is an example for all of us. And 
the fact that everybody here today in 
this Chamber has an opportunity to 
play a small part in that is quite excit-
ing. 
I think, 10 years from now, when 
there is a 6-year-old kid walking in the 
new Smithsonian museum for the 
American Latino, and they see some-
thing about PETE AGUILAR, it is going 
to be an exciting opportunity for me in 
the future, and I am glad to play a 
small part. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘aye’’ on this landmark piece of legis-
lation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I certainly hope that 
that exhibit honoring PETE AGUILAR is 
not because of winning the Congres-
sional Baseball Game, but I would be 
glad to see any exhibit honoring many 
of our colleagues who have served, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the ranking member for 
his support of this legislation, and the 
gentleman from Texas, who never 
misses an opportunity to give shout- 
outs to San Antonio and the individ-
uals associated with this who are from 
San Antonio.

July 27, 2020 
I should also thank Chairwoman ZOE 
LOFGREN from the House Administra-
tion Committee, who worked with Mr. 
DAVIS and who guided this legislation 
through the committee so we can have 
an opportunity to vote on it. 
This is truly a bipartisan piece of leg-
islation, and I tip my hat to Mr. HURD 
and Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER for whip-
ping votes and getting some colleagues 
to be supportive as well and, as Mr. 
HURD mentioned, the Friends of the 
American Latino Museum, an outside 
group that has been supportive of this 
legislation in a key way and stands 
ready to work with us to accomplish 
this mission. 
As my colleagues have said, the time 
is now. It is important to pass this 
piece of legislation. It is important to 
start this process and to recognize the 
rich contributions that Latinos have 
made to American history. 
Madam Speaker, once again, I would 
just like to urge my colleagues to sup-
port H.R. 2420, as amended, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 2420, as amended. 
H.R. 2420 would establish the National Mu-
seum of the American Latino in the Smithso-
nian Institution and begin the process of bring-
ing bricks and mortar reality to the dream of 
having a museum dedicated to telling another 
part of the American story. 
The genesis of this museum dates to 1994 
and a Smithsonian task force report titled 
‘‘Willful Neglect: The Smithsonian Institution 
and U.S. Latinos.’’ This report found a serious 
underrepresentation of Latinos and their con-
tributions to our history at the Smithsonian. 
In 2008 a commission was established to 
study the need for a museum. In 2011, the 
Commission to Study the Potential Creation of 
the National Museum of the American Latino 
issued its report. The Commission reported 
that ‘‘the time has come for the creation of a 
new museum on the National Mall’’ that ‘‘re-
flects the contributions of Latinos to every as-
pect of American History and Culture.’’ 
In February, I was pleased to chair a hear-
ing examining this and other opportunities for 
growth at the Smithsonian. At that hearing, our 
colleague and sponsor of this legislation, Rep-
resentative 
JOSE
SERRANO
testified 
that 
‘‘Latinos have left an indelible mark on our na-
tion’s history and helped shape it in ways that 
most Americans, and even many in our own 
community, are unaware. We have served in 
every war since the American Revolution, 
fighting bravely and paying a heavy price on 
behalf of our Nation. We write award-winning 
Broadway plays and films. We are sports he-
roes and legends. We have been on the 
frontlines of the fights for civil rights. We have 
shaped the music we all dance to, the food we 
eat, and countless other staples of American 
life. 
But Latino art and history is noticeably ab-
sent from recognition in many cultural institu-
tions across the Nation, including the Smithso-
nian. To deny the telling of these stories not 
only does a disservice to our contributions and 
sacrifices, but also renders American history 
incomplete. There is no doubt that without the 
significant contributions of Latinos, the country 
we know today would be much different.’’ 
Passage of the measure before us is just 
the next step in this journey. But it is a critical 
one. I will remind my colleagues that these 
projects, even once authorized, take many 
years to complete. The legislation authorizing 
the National Museum of African American His-
tory and Culture was enacted in 2003, and 
that wonderful museum opened its doors in 
2016. 
At the hearing in February I noted that I rep-
resent San Jose and Santa Clara county. San 
Jose is home to northern California’s largest 
Mexican American community. For years, I 
have seen firsthand how this community, and 
all of the communities in my district embody 
the American experience, and the stories that 
each tell make the story of America richer and 
more complete. 
Later today we will say honor the life of our 
colleague, the late Representative John Lewis. 
At the 50th anniversary of the March on 
Washington, John said ‘‘We are one people; 
we are only family. We are all living in the 
same house—not just the American house but 
the world house. And when we finally accept 
these truths, then we will be able to fulfill Dr. 
King’s dream to build a beloved community, a 
nation, and a world at peace with itself.’’ 
Telling the stories of Latino Americans is 
necessary part of building a beloved commu-
nity. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2420 
and take the next step in this important jour-
ney. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in strong support of H.R. 2420, the National 
Museum of the American Latino Act, a bipar-
tisan piece of legislation that will help elevate 
and promote the stories of the Latino commu-
nity in the United States. 
The Latino community represents over one- 
sixth of the American population. Their con-
tributions to the history of the United States 
throughout the centuries has been both signifi-
cant and fundamental. Whether it be through 
their advancements to American innovation, to 
serving faithfully and heroically in every Amer-
ican war, the Latino and Latina population has 
always been steadfast in their commitment to 
the United States and its values. 
Since my appointment to the Smithsonian 
Board of Regents in 2019, I have continued to 
voice my strong support for this legislation, 
and I am proud the Latino community is one 
step closer to finally having their legacy for-
ever enshrined on the National Mall. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Congress-
man SERRANO and Congressman HURD on 
their tireless work advancing this legislation, 
and I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on 
H.R. 2420. 
Mr. SERRANO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2420, the National Mu-
seum of the American Latino Act. This legisla-
tion would establish a National Museum of the 
American Latino within the Smithsonian Insti-
tution on the National Mall in Washington, 
D.C. dedicated to celebrating the significant 
historical, cultural, and artistic contributions of 
Latinos in the United States. 
With a population of more than 60 million, 
Latinos are the largest minority ethnic group in 
the United States and the territories. They 
have accounted for nearly half of the Nation’s 
population 
growth 
since 
2010. 
However, 
Latinos continue facing systemic underrep-
resentation in the halls of Congress, Holly-
wood, academia, corporate America, and 
nearly every aspect of American life. This dis-
parity also exists within our nation’s cultural in-
stitutions, including the Smithsonian. 
We must not forget that Latinos were here 
before the founding of our country. They have 
fought in every American war since the Revo-
lution. They have also been at the forefront of 
every historical moment that has helped shape 
our way of life, from the fight for labor rights 
to the fight for gay rights. These stories are 
nearly absent from our textbooks and class-
rooms, but they are essential to learning who 
we are as a Nation. Simply put, Latino history 
is American history. 
It has been 26 years since the Smithsonian 
acknowledged its own lack of Latino represen-
tation with their 1994 report, Willful Neglect. 
It has been 17 years since former Rep-
resentatives Xavier Becerra of California and 
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida introduced the 
first bill to create a commission to study the 
potential creation of a Latino Museum and 12 
years since it became law. 
It has been more than eight years since the 
23-member National Museum of the American 
Latino Commission presented a detailed plan 
to President Barack Obama and the U.S. Con-
gress laying out the blueprint to get us there. 
We cannot wait any longer. It is time for 
Congress to act. 
Latinos deserve a dedicated space in the 
heart of Washington, D.C. where our experi-
ences can be shared with the world. Today, 
we finally begin the process of setting that 
plan into motion. 
I am proud to have led this effort in the 
House of Representatives during the 116th 
Congress and my final term in office, along 
with my colleague WILL HURD of Texas. This 
was a true team effort. 
I also want to thank my colleagues from 
California, TONY CA´RDENAS and PETE AGUILAR, 
for their tremendous efforts. From building 
record support with 295 bipartisan cosponsors 
to leading today’s debate on the House floor. 
I want to thank Congressional Hispanic 
Caucus Chairman JOAQUIN CASTRO and all my 
colleagues with the CHC for their steadfast 
support of this project from the very beginning. 
I want to thank Natural Resources Com-
mittee Chairman RAU´ L
GRIJALVA, Ranking 
Member DON
YOUNG, and Subcommittee 
Chair DEB HAALAND for their leadership in 
holding the first legislative hearing on the bill 
last October. 
I want to thank House Administration Chair-
person ZOE LOFGREN and Ranking Member 
RODNEY DAVIS for favorably reporting the bill 
out of committee. 
Finally, I would especially like to thank 
Speaker NANCY PELOSI and Majority Leader 
STENY HOYER for their commitment in bringing 
this bill before the full House of Representa-
tives for a vote today. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2420 
and help get us one step closer to turning this 
dream into a reality. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
AGUILAR) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2420, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

July 27, 2020 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we remember the 
life and legacy of Congressman John 
Lewis. We mourn his passing, but we 
celebrate his incalculable contribu-
tions to our country. The world is truly 
a better place because John dedicated 
his life to make it so. 
I rise in front of this Chamber as we 
vote to create the commission on the 
social status of Black men and boys. 
This commission is only possible be-
cause of the barriers broken by Black 
men like John Lewis. It is only pos-
sible because of the tireless efforts of 
Black 
women 
like 
Congresswoman 
FREDERICA WILSON, who has led the in-
troduction of this bill. 
The world has changed for Black men 
and boys in this country since John 
Lewis was beaten and bloodied on a 
bridge in Selma, Alabama. We have 
come a long way, but it is no secret 
that Black men and boys continue to 
face unjust hurdles in America. The 
commission will search for ways to ad-
dress these inequities, from education 
to 
unemployment, 
housing 
to 
healthcare, justice to civil rights. 
As John once said: We have a moral 
obligation, a mission, and a mandate to 
do what we can to make our country 
and our world a better place and to 
help usher in a loving community 
where no one is left out or left behind. 
I believe this commission will help us 
do just that. I believe that it will help 
us create a better future for our chil-
dren and for our grandchildren because 
while we have come so far, we still 
have a long way to go. 
I know that you can do everything 
right as a parent and still see your 
child, a young Black man, taken away 
from you for reasons that are far out of 
your control. 
When I got pregnant with my son, 
Jordan, he was a miracle for me. I 
wasn’t sure I was ever going to be able 
to have children. I dreamed of who Jor-
dan would become. I dreamed of watch-
ing him walk across the stage at his 
high school graduation, full of love and 
full of hope for the future. 
But almost 8 years ago, Jordan was 
sitting in the back seat of a car with 
his friends at a gas station. A man 
pulled up, parked next to them, and 
complained about the loud music that 
they were playing. He pulled out a gun, 
and he fired 10 shots into the car, hit-
ting Jordan three times, killing my 
only son. And then, he simply drove 
away. 
I believed I had done everything 
right, but at the end of the day, Jordan 
was a young Black man. And I felt that 
injustice. 
So while I look back at the life and 
legacy of John Lewis, and I remark 
how far we truly have come, I must 
also look toward a future without my 
son, and I see how far we still have to 
go. 
As we vote today to create the com-
mission on the social status of Black 
men and boys, I hope we can go forward 
in strength and in hope because there 
is always hope. It is what brings us to-
gether. 
We can work toward a future that we 
all believe in, and I am proud to take 
the next step on that journey today. I 
urge my colleagues to stand with me in 
supporting this bipartisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1100 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
2163, the Commission on the Social 
Status of Black Men and Boys Act. 
I want to thank Senator RUBIO for 
his leadership on this bill in the Senate 
and Representative WILSON
for her 
leadership in the House. I want to say 
a special thanks to my friend, Con-
gresswoman MCBATH, for utilizing such 
a personal and tragic story toward a 
positive outcome. It is great to be here 
with the gentlewoman this morning. 
This bill establishes a commission 
within the U.S. Commission on Civil 
Rights dedicated to studying condi-
tions and disparities that both Black 
men and boys face. The commission 
will study issues such as arrest and in-
carceration rates, poverty, homicide, 
school performance, disparate income 
levels, and health issues. 
Congressional leadership, the Presi-
dent, and the executive agencies will 
appoint at least 19 members to serve on 
this 
bipartisan 
commission. 
Those 
members are charged with developing 
policy recommendations, documenting 
trends, and issuing an annual report 
aimed at reducing the adversity con-
fronting Black men and boys across 
this Nation. These reports and rec-
ommendations will assist Congress and 
the rest of the Federal Government in 
creating 
policies 
to 
address 
these 
issues. The bill mandates political par-
ity among the members of the commis-
sion in an effort to reduce the potential 
for political partisanship and bias. 
Our founding document, the Declara-
tion of Independence, declares that all 
men are created equal, and the eastern 
facade of the Supreme Court pro-
nounces equal justice under the law. 
However, we all know inequality still 
exists. As a defense attorney, I saw how 
sentencing disparities on drug crimes, 
minimum 
mandatory 
sentencing, 
school zone sentencing enhancements, 
and pretrial release policies often had 
disparate racial impacts. 
By creating a bipartisan commission 
to study inequality in government pro-
grams, we take the necessary steps to 
identify and address disparities for 
Black American men and boys. This 
bill will help ensure that we make 
meaningful progress in creating a more 
free and equal country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in support of this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank my colleague, Mr. ARM-
STRONG, for such passionate and com-
mitted words toward truly making sure 
that we have a just and fair society for 
everyone. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE), who is my good friend. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship, and I particularly rise today to 
thank all of my colleagues who joined 
in this historic moment with Congress-
woman FREDERICA WILSON. Let it be 
known how hard and consistently she 
worked and with much perseverance 
and determination. We give her tribute 
today. We thank Senator RUBIO
for 
joining and helping with the Senate, 
because it is a bipartisan bill. We, like-
wise, acknowledge the Commission on 
the Social Status of Black Men and 
Boys. We acknowledge these words 
that she said to me this morning: It 
will help save lives. 
That is why we stand on the floor 
today, because we recognize that sys-
temic racism exists and the encounters 
of our young boys with people who de-
termine that they are not human or 
equal wind up in the great loss of life 
or their encounter with each other. So 
I am delighted that members of the Ju-
diciary Committee, members of the 
Education and Labor Committee, and 
other committees focus on how we can 
do well. 
This Scripture reminds me of where 
we are today: ‘‘ . . . this is the kind of 
fasting I want: Free those who are 
wrongly imprisoned; lighten the burden 
of those who work for you. Let the op-
pressed go free, and remove the chains 
that bind people. Share your food with 
the hungry, and give shelter to the 
homeless.’’ 
This is a time where we are doing 
what we need to do for Black boys and 
men. This is a time when we stand up 
and be counted to end systemic racism 
as it impacts them and this Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask support for this 
outstanding and historic legislation. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of this legisla-
tion which will create a long-overdue 
Commission on the Social Status of 
Black Men and Boys. 
We have come a long way in America, 
but we still have a long way to go. 
Slavery was not a necessary evil. It 
was a crime against humanity an-
chored in kidnap, rape, torture, lynch-
ing, and the systemic oppression and

enslavement of people of African de-
scent century after century after cen-
tury. We are still living with its legacy 
today. 
Frederick Douglass once said: ‘‘It is 
easier to build strong children than it 
is to repair broken men.’’ So it is my 
hope that this commission can begin 
the real process of repairing broken 
boys, broken men, broken families, and 
broken communities as a result of the 
systemic racism that has been in the 
soil of America for 401 years. 
I thank the distinguished gentle-
woman from Florida, FREDERICA WIL-
SON, for her tremendous leadership. 
Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
House Judiciary Committee and a cosponsor 
of the House companion to this bill, I rise in 
strong support of S. 2163 ‘‘The Commission 
on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys 
Act of 2019’’, which establishes a bipartisan 
commission that will examine the social dis-
parities that disproportionately affect black 
men and boys in America. 
I want to thank my friend and colleague, 
FREDERICA WILSON, for introducing this crucial 
piece of legislation. 
As we have seen time and time again, the 
reality of being Black in America today is char-
acterized by facing insurmountable and unjust 
challenges in every aspect of day-to-day life 
as well as living in constant fear for your life. 
From Trayvon Martin to Tamir Rice to 
Ahmaud Arbery to George Floyd, our Black 
brothers are targeted and murdered for the 
color of their skin. 
We are all too familiar with the over-
whelming hardships and significant societal 
disparities that face Black men every day in 
education, criminal justice, health, employ-
ment, and so many other areas. 
The low rate of high school retention among 
black male students is directly related to the 
high rates of joblessness and incarceration in 
the African-American population. 
It’s no secret that mass incarceration has 
unfairly and disproportionately affected the 
lives of Black men in the United States. 
African Americans are incarcerated at more 
than 5 times the rate of their white counter-
parts. 
And 1 out of every 3 Black boys born today 
can expect to be sentenced to prison, com-
pared 1 out 6 Latino boys; one out of 17 white 
boys. 
These barriers to quality employment further 
exacerbate the cycles of poverty that in turn 
lead to severe inequities in the areas of health 
and quality health care. 
We must find ways to disrupt and end this 
cycle and instead empower and uplift the 
Black community. 
With this in mind, this bill enables our nation 
to better understand and eventually eliminate 
the educational and social chasms that have 
made it extraordinarily difficult for black males 
to become upwardly mobile. 
This bipartian commission will recommend 
actionable policies and practices to improve 
upon or augment current government pro-
grams to alleviate and remedy the underlying 
causes of the adverse social conditions that 
are a reality for too many black men and boys. 
I ask all members to join me in voting for S. 
2163, ‘‘The Commission on the Social Status 
of Black Men and Boys Act of 2019.’’ 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by ac-
knowledging the extraordinary leader-
ship of FREDERICA
WILSON, who has 
spent her entire life dedicated to the 
well-being of young Black men and 
boys and has decades and decades of in-
credible support of young people in her 
community. This commission is a re-
flection of that commitment. 
Merely because of the color of their 
skin, 
Black 
men 
and 
boys 
are 
criminalized, separated from their fam-
ilies and communities, and targeted for 
police violence at alarmingly high 
rates. Black men are 250 percent more 
likely to be killed by police than White 
men. That fact is a stain on the soul of 
this country. 
But America’s sins extend far beyond 
the deadly disparities in policing. Rac-
ism touches nearly every aspect of our 
lives, oftentimes in the most insidious 
and subtle of ways, yet still in plain 
view in the areas of healthcare, edu-
cation, and economic opportunities. 
We must address the sins of Amer-
ica’s past that have revealed them-
selves in the inequalities of America’s 
present. The Commission on the Social 
Status of Black Men and Boys moves 
us one step closer to building a more 
perfect Union where all Americans, re-
gardless of race, have an equal oppor-
tunity, not just to get by, but to get 
ahead. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for his courtesy, and I strongly urge 
my colleagues to support this excellent 
bill. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE), who is our great 
fighter for justice. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
first, let me thank the gentlewoman 
for yielding and for sharing her story 
about her beautiful son, Jordan, and 
using her tragedy to ensure not only 
the survival, but the thriving, for Afri-
can-American boys and men. 
Also, to Congresswoman WILSON, I 
have to thank FREDERICA for her ex-
traordinary leadership and determina-
tion to ensure that the disparities af-
fecting our Black men and boys are fi-
nally being heard and addressed within 
our Federal Government. 
While serving in the California Legis-
lature, I initiated and chaired the Cali-
fornia Commission on the Status of Af-
rican-American Males. Those findings 
sparked a difficult but necessary dis-
cussion in our State, which is still rel-
evant today, and were implemented as 
legislation and funding priorities. 
This commission at the national 
level is long overdue. All too often, 
Black men and boys face structural 
challenges that threaten their chance 
at a good education, harm their health, 
and limit their employment potential. 
Additionally, the low rate of high 
school retention among Black male 
students is directly related to the high 
rates of joblessness and incarceration 
in the African-American population. 
In this moment, the horrors of sys-
temic racism are front and center, and 
the manifestations are before us each 
and every day. 
This commission brings hope. It will 
transform the lives of young Black 
men from infancy to adulthood and 
will begin to remove so many of the 
barriers that have led to shattered 
lives and hopelessness. It is about hope. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY), who is an 
extraordinary warrior for justice in 
America. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, today 
I rise on behalf of every Black man and 
Black boy who has been dehumanized, 
surveilled, and targeted by the policies 
drafted and debated within the walls of 
this very institution and institutions 
of power throughout our Nation. 
I rise today to offer my unwavering 
support and to thank Congresswoman 
WILSON for laboring in love to see the 
Commission on the Social Status of 
Black Men and Boys Act become a re-
ality. It is long-overdue legislation 
that will push our Nation one step clos-
er to grappling with the systemic rac-
ism and structural barriers that have 
robbed us of the lives of our Black hus-
bands, our Black brothers, and our 
Black sons. 
Passage of this bill today is a testa-
ment to the longstanding calls and ef-
forts in communities, including in my 
own Boston. When I was on the Boston 
City Council in 2014, we attempted to 
establish a commission like this, and 
that effort was vetoed. So it feels so 
good to see this happening on the Fed-
eral level. 
The passage of this bill today is a 
testament to the longstanding calls 
and efforts throughout our Nation to 
examine and combat the systemic in-
equities 
and 
disparities 
impacting 
Black boys and men from education 
and employment to health and to hous-
ing and to incarceration. 
With this bill’s passage today, we de-
clare on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the people’s House, that 
we are our brother’s keeper, that Black 
lives matter, that Black men matter, 
and that our Black boys matter. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER), who is my good 
friend and comrade. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s courtesy 
and her courage, and I welcome this 
commission’s coming forward. It is 
part of a dynamic that is playing out 
across American cities. In my commu-
nity, the cries for racial justice and the 
recognition of the challenges that have 
been faced by Black men and boys in 
this commission is a step in that direc-
tion.

But I would say this Congress can 
take another step. We have the MORE 
Act which would legalize cannabis. The 
selective enforcement of the prohibi-
tion of marijuana against Black men 
and boys has been a tragedy. It has ru-
ined hundreds of thousands of lives. 
This Congress can take action. The 
bill has already passed out of our Judi-
ciary Committee with a bipartisan ma-
jority. We ought to include that in our 
next package and start to right the 
wrongs and pry away the cold hand of 
Richard Nixon’s misguided war on 
drugs that has had such a vicious im-
pact on Black men and women. 
We ought to start with that now. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
We also have the STATES Act, which 
enjoys a huge bipartisan cosponsorship 
among members of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
I think it is unfortunate that some-
times 
we 
choose 
partisanship 
and 
gamesmanship over passing what I 
think is one of the most criminal jus-
tice reform-minded and drug reform- 
minded Congresses that has ever set 
foot in Washington, D.C., and there is a 
bill that actually would have the po-
tential to possibly become law. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), who is a 
good friend and a committed Member 
from the Sunshine State of Florida. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of this im-
portant legislation authored by my 
friend and colleague, Congresswoman 
WILSON.

serving 
on 
Miami-Dade’s 
School Board and seeing too many 
young Black men drop out of school 
with lifelong repercussions, Congress-
woman WILSON has worked tirelessly to 
intervene. She single-handedly began 
the 5000 Role Models of Excellence 
Project, a highly successful mentorship 
and leadership program that continues 
to transform countless young Black 
men’s lives. 
In the wake of George Floyd’s mur-
der, millions of voices have demanded 
justice and a dismantling of the oppres-
sive systems that harmed Black men 
for generations. 
In America, Black children are three 
times more likely to be born in poverty 
than White children. School districts 
where the majority of those enrolled 
are students of color receive billions 
less than mostly White districts, while 
disciplinary policies in classes dis-
proportionately impact Black students. 
After school, Black male unemploy-
ment is consistently almost double 
that of their White counterparts. Black 
men represent 12 percent of the popu-
lation but approximately 33 percent of 
the prison population. 
This legislation makes righting these 
wrongs a priority by creating this na-
tional 
commission 
to 
recommend 
major changes to policy to dramati-
cally improve the lives of Black men 
and boys. 
Congresswoman FREDERICA
WILSON 
has made this her life’s work. She has 
literally carried thousands of young 
men on her shoulders to success. 
As we honor the legacy of John 
Lewis, there is no more appropriate 
tribute than to pass this bill and con-
tinue the long march toward racial 
equality.

Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. MEEKS), a stalwart for jus-
tice and hope. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I first 
thank Congresswoman WILSON, and, of 
course, Congresswoman MCBATH. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand before you 
today to speak on the creation of a 
Commission on the Social Status of 
Black Men and Boys at the U.S. Civil 
Rights Commission. Racial inequality 
in this country remains stark and stub-
born. Black men are 40 percent more 
likely to be unemployed today than 
White men; twice as likely not to own 
the home they live in; 21⁄2 times as like-
ly to be killed by police officers; and 5 
times as likely to be locked behind 
bars. 
Mr. Speaker, we cannot ignore these 
problems. We can’t waive away what is 
right before our eyes. Racial inequality 
in this country must be confronted. 
The time has come to address this 
most painful of issues. Indeed, the time 
has long past, but justice delayed is 
better than no justice at all. 
‘‘To those who have said, ‘Be patient 
and wait,’ we have long said that we 
cannot be patient. We do not want our 
freedom gradually; but we want to be 
free now. We are tired. We are tired of 
being beaten by policemen. We are 
tired of seeing our people locked up in 
jail over and over again. And then you 
holler, ‘Be patient.’ How long can we be 
patient? We want our freedom, and we 
want it now.’’ 
These are the words of John Robert 
Lewis at the March on Washington in 
1963, and we need to heed them today. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. JUDY CHU), who is a good 
friend and colleague fighting on behalf 
of communities of color. 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of Senate 2163, a bill to address the 
root causes of inequality for Black men 
and boys in America. 
Mr. Speaker, today, as the civil 
rights icon, John Lewis, is laying in 
state just a few feet in the Capitol ro-
tunda, I am so moved to know that the 
banner of equality, which he waved his 
whole life is being picked up by the 
next generation. 
As chair of the Congressional Asian 
Pacific American Caucus, I have seen 
Americans of all backgrounds and 
ethnicities united in filling the streets 
to demand reforms to a criminal jus-
tice system that does not value Black 
lives and to an economy that does not 
give Black boys an equal chance of suc-
cess. 
The people have had enough with the 
systemic inequalities that have per-
sisted since our founding. But we can-
not fix them unless we understand 
them. That is what this commission 
will do by looking at the obstacles and 
policy and culture that keep Black 
youth from having the same opportuni-
ties that Whites do. We must listen to 
the demands of a country that is say-
ing ‘‘no’’ to racial inequality. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), the gentleman 
from my original home State. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Georgia for giving me the oppor-
tunity to speak on this important bill. 
As a matter of fact, Representative 
FREDERICA WILSON has made this her 
life’s work. As a matter of fact, I am 
wearing her 5000 Role Model tie, where 
for many years she established one of 
the most effective programs in public 
education with the Dade Miami school 
board, where 5,000 young males are 
taught and trained. 
Mr. Speaker, we have had many ef-
forts. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON and I 
created the Caucus on Black Men and 
Boys. We have been all over the coun-
try with conferences. And I remind us 
that what we say is one thing, but 
what we do is something else. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that we take into 
consideration all of the things that we 
know that has caused the disparities 
among African American males and do 
something that is going to really make 
a difference. Put them into action. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Georgia has 61⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
North Dakota has 161⁄2 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, on be-
half of the gentlewoman from Florida 
(Ms. WILSON), I read into the RECORD a 
statement. 
Mr. Speaker, the Commission on the Social 
Status of Black Men and Boys is a bill that 
is long overdue. The Commission will review 
police brutality, gun violence, fatherhood, 
recruiting and training Black male teachers, 
and even speakers, which play an important 
role in the lives of Black boys. Welfare re-
form and the 1994 crime bill—which includes 
the controversial ‘‘Three Strikes’’ provision 
and harsh sentencing guidelines—will also be 
revisited. These Federal policies left a dev-
astating impact on Black men and boys in 
America. 
The underlying goal of the commission is 
to interrupt the school-to-prison pipeline 
and to better understand and, eventually, 
eliminate the educational and social chasms 
that have made it extraordinarily difficult 
for Black males to become upwardly mobile. 
Perhaps, the most dangerous issue facing 
Black boys in our country is racism itself. 
Too often, they are perceived as criminals by

the time they reach the age of 5. They are la-
beled delinquent, not rowdy. They are hard-
ened criminals, not misguided youth. Their 
very existence is often seen as a threat. It is 
a tragic reality that Black males in America 
are treated as their own class of citizens. 
We see this treatment reflected in social 
outcomes in such areas as education, crimi-
nal justice, healthcare, and employment. 
The numbers are staggering. More than 1 out 
of every 6 Black men, who, today, should be 
between the ages of 20 and 54 years old have 
disappeared from our daily lives. Low rates 
of high school retention among Black male 
students directly relates to the high rates of 
joblessness and incarceration. 
More than two-thirds of Black male drop-
outs end up serving time in State or Federal 
prison, and while Black males overall make 
up roughly 13 percent of the United States 
population, they represent nearly 40 percent 
of all men serving time in State and Federal 
prisons. 
Mr. Speaker, I am confident that the Com-
mission on the Social Status of Black Men 
and Boys will change the world for so many 
people and create the paths to success that 
they have been denied for generations, and, 
ultimately, close societal, economic, and 
cultural divides. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. I am not an expert on 
all of these issues, but I do know quite 
a bit about criminal justice. It is im-
portant to recognize that a lot of 
things we are talking about in these 
bills are delivered at the local level, 
whether it is criminal justice, whether 
it is education, whether it is any of 
those types of things. 
This isn’t about percentages and data 
points. This is about communities, and 
this is about people. But at no time in 
history have we been better able to col-
lect information in a more usable way. 
When I served in the State senate in 
North Dakota, I was the chair of what 
we call our Justice Reinvestment Com-
mittee. And what we found out very 
shortly was that our data was all over 
the place. In order to make smart, ef-
fectuating change and provide local-
ities and States and communities with 
the proper information so they can tar-
get where they can really do the most 
good—oftentimes on strained budgets 
and just different areas—it is impor-
tant that studies like this come out be-
cause there are things we can do in 
Congress. 
To be quite frank, we are behind the 
game. Conservative and liberal States 
all across the country have started on 
this, and they started before us—States 
like North Dakota, States like Colo-
rado, States like Mississippi. It is our 
job to get in the game. It is our job to 
provide them with the information we 
can. And, yes, we will make reforms 
here, but we will also give them the 
tools and the data so they can really 
take a deep dive into their own com-
munities and figure out where they can 
best serve their constituents and where 
they can start getting rid of these in-
stitutional racial disparities that exist, 
whether it be in the criminal justice 
system, whether it be in education, 
whether it be in healthcare. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member, Mr. ARMSTRONG, and my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
for supporting our need to really make 
systemic change in the country. 
I also thank Congresswoman WILSON. 
If it had not been for her legislation, I 
wouldn’t be standing before you today. 
Congressman RICHMOND and also Con-
gressman JEFFRIES, Senator RUBIO, 
Senator HARRIS, and Senator BOOKER; 
it has been an honor to work with each 
of them in bringing this bipartisan leg-
islation to a vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for their support for this very, very 
critical bill, and I look forward to the 
important work that this commission 
will accomplish on behalf of all Black 
men and boys and on behalf of my son, 
Jordan. I am so grateful to this body 
for finding this so critically important, 
so that no one will ever have to feel the 
pain of losing their Black child, their 
Black male son to the disparities and 
inequities that face communities of 
color each and every single day. I 
thank every one of my colleagues. I 
thank the thousands and thousands of 
parents that I have spoken to over the 
years, and all of the survivors of the 
families who have lost their loved ones. 
I thank them for finding this impor-
tant. I thank them for standing up and 
finding this timely in a world that 
doesn’t always see young Black males 
as human. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. 
MCBATH) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 2163. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.

DIRECTING THE CLERK OF THE

IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 4

S4491 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JULY 27, 2020 
No. 132 
Senate 
The Senate met at 4 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Lord God, we again thank 
You for the life and legacy of Rep-
resentative John Robert Lewis. 
Lord, accept our gratitude for his 
ethical congruence that motivated him 
to find a moral way to get in the way. 
We are grateful that his passion for 
freedom summoned our Nation to em-
brace our best hopes and not our worst 
fears. Inspired by his exemplary pil-
grimage, may our lawmakers strive to 
live with such integrity that they will 
stand on the right side of history. 
Lord, help our Senators to strive to 
see You more clearly, to love You more 
dearly, and to follow You more nearly 
day by day. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Former Vice Presi-
dent Biden and Minority Leader SCHU-
MER have indicated a willingness to end 
the so-called filibuster if Democrats 
gain a majority in the U.S. Senate 
after this year’s election. 
Meanwhile, Democrats used the same 
rule to prevent even taking up Senator 
SCOTT’s very thoughtful police reform 
legislation. The rule in question is the 
cloture rule, which brings debate and 
amendments to a close so we can get to 
the finality of a bill. What Democrats 
blocked was ending debate on pro-
ceeding to police reform and starting 
to consider any amendments that 
wanted to be offered, but it would have 
taken yet another cloture vote to get 
to final passage. 
The cloture rule ensures that no po-
lice reform bill could be passed by the 
U.S. Senate unless at least 60 Senators 
were satisfied with the outcome of the 
amendment process. In other words, it 
guarantees that the concerns of the mi-
nority party—whether that be Repub-
lican or Democrat—would have to be 
addressed. There was no excuse for pre-
venting the Senate from even begin-
ning the legislative process on this ex-
tremely important and timely issue of 
police reform. 
There is also no excuse for Demo-
crats who claimed to oppose the 60-vote 
requirement to cut off debate on prin-
ciple when they were last in the major-
ity, who then immediately began using 
cloture to block bills that had majority 
support when they lost their majority, 
and who still continue to use cloture to 
block progress on important issues 
today, but who now fully admit that 
they will change the Senate institu-
tion—the protection for the minority— 
if it suits their partisan purpose in the 
future. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Today, 
as 
we 
speak, the U.S. Congress confers a rare 
and high honor on a national hero who 
richly deserves it. Our distinguished 
late 
colleague, 
Congressman 
John 
Lewis, is lying in state in the Rotunda. 
I had the honor to speak at this 
afternoon’s ceremony—how amazing to 
reflect on John’s incredible American 
life. It began deep in the segregated 
South, ran through lunch counters in 
Nashville, jail cells in Mississippi, 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, up 
the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and 
brought him to the halls of Congress. 
He made heroic contributions to our 
Nation’s march toward racial justice. 
He also brought an unforgettable ex-
ample of moral urgency, respect, and 
love to Washington that left an impact 
on everyone he met. His example will 
be missed here in the Capitol. He will 
be remembered forever by a grateful 
Nation because, as far as I am con-
cerned, it is not really the rest of us in 
Congress who are conveying an honor 
upon John Lewis today, not this time. 
Rather, it is John who is bringing 
greater honor to us, to this Capitol, 
with his presence, one final time. 
f 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
COVID–19 has killed nearly 150,000 
Americans. It has caused massive lay-
offs on a historic scale and left 17 mil-
lion people out of work. It has thrown 
the lives and the trajectories of our Na-
tion’s children and young adults into 
uncertainty. 
Our Nation stands now at an impor-
tant crossroads in this battle. Amer-
ican 
families’ 
historic 
sacrifices 
brought our medical system through

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4492 
July 27, 2020 
the springtime intact. The very early 
stages of our economic recovery have 
been promising and our Nation needs 
to continue to proceed with a smart 
and safe reopening. 
At the same time, the virus is still 
with us. It is still spreading, and it 
does not care about our fragile eco-
nomic progress or our frustration with 
restrictions, or anything else, besides 
infecting as many people as possible. 
So we have one foot in the pandemic 
and one foot in the recovery. The 
American people need more help. They 
need it to be comprehensive, and they 
need it to be carefully tailored to these 
crossroads. 
That is what this Senate majority 
has assembled, and that is what Chair-
men ALEXANDER, BLUNT, COLLINS, GRA-
HAM, GRASSLEY, RUBIO, and SHELBY, 
and Senators CORNYN and ROMNEY are 
introducing today. They will be coming 
to the floor shortly to introduce their 
components. 
Together, their bills make up the 
HEALS Act—health, economic assist-
ance, 
liability 
protection, 
and 
schools—health, economic assistance, 
liability protection, and schools. 
Just like in March, with the CARES 
Act, Senate Republicans have authored 
another bold framework to help our 
Nation. Now we need our Democratic 
colleagues to reprise their part as well. 
They need to put aside the partisan 
stonewalling we saw on police reform 
and rediscover the spirit of urgency 
that got the CARES Act across the fin-
ish line, and quickly join us around the 
negotiating table. 
It will take bipartisan cooperation to 
make the HEALS Act into law for the 
American people. The Senate will not 
waste time with pointless partisanship. 
There is a reason why even Speaker 
PELOSI
and Leader SCHUMER
them-
selves have publicly downplayed the 
multitrillion-dollar socialist manifesto 
they published a few weeks back and 
have suggested the real, serious discus-
sion would begin when Republicans re-
leased our outline. 
We have produced a tailored and tar-
geted draft that will cut right to the 
heart of three distinct crises facing our 
country—getting kids back in school, 
getting workers back to work, and win-
ning the healthcare fight against the 
virus—kids, jobs, and healthcare. 
First, our Nation’s kids. Chairmen 
ALEXANDER, BLUNT, and SHELBY will be 
introducing a sweeping package to help 
schools and universities reopen safely. 
We are talking about more than $100 
billion—more for an education fund 
than House Democrats put aside in a 
bill that spent multiple trillions. There 
are policies to help childcare providers 
and schools have the flexibility they 
need to function. 
Second, jobs. Since our Nation has 
one foot in the pandemic and one foot 
in the recovery, our economic policies 
have to acknowledge both sides of that 
coin. Chairman GRASSLEY will intro-
duce another round of direct checks for 
households at the same amount as be-
fore, with even more support for fami-
lies who care for vulnerable adult de-
pendents. 
Chairmen COLLINS and RUBIO have 
designed a sequel to their historic PPP 
to help prevent more layoffs of Amer-
ican workers. 
Republicans want to continue a Fed-
eral supplement to State unemploy-
ment insurance. In fact, we will pro-
pose a weekly dollar amount that is 
eight times what Democrats put in 
place when they controlled the White 
House and Congress during the great 
recession. But we have to do it in a 
way that does not slow down reopen-
ing. 
We are also going to help this coun-
try pivot into recovery. The American 
people don’t just want relief; they want 
opportunity so long as the reopenings 
can be safe. So Chairman GRASSLEY 
will walk through strong economic in-
centives to boost worker retention, get 
Americans rehired, and help small 
businesses buy the PPE, testing, and 
supplies that will protect employees 
and customers alike. 
Senator ROMNEY has legislation to 
help a future Congress ensure our crit-
ical 
national 
trust 
funds 
remain 
strong. 
In looking to our long-term jobs fu-
ture, there is no question this pan-
demic has America and our allies reex-
amining our degree of dependence on 
China. Chairman GRAHAM
is intro-
ducing a package of legislation that 
will incentivize PPE manufacturing 
right here at home. It will ensure that 
our efforts to rebuild our national 
stockpile of protective gear actually 
benefit American workers instead of 
just stimulating China, and it will 
bring a heightened focus to other key 
concerns, such as high-tech semicon-
ductor manufacturing, critical min-
erals, and intellectual property theft so 
that the lessons of this pandemic do 
not go unlearned. 
Finally, healthcare. Chairmen ALEX-
ANDER, GRASSLEY, and others I have al-
ready named have legislation to keep 
America on offense against this virus 
for diagnostics, treatments, vaccines, 
hospitals and healthcare workers, and 
protecting seniors who rely on Medi-
care from premium spikes. Our legisla-
tion supports all of it at continued his-
toric levels. 
In tying kids, jobs, and healthcare all 
together, Senator CORNYN has authored 
strong legal liability protections so 
that nurses, doctors, charities, school 
districts, colleges, and employers can 
spend their next months actually re-
opening rather than fighting for their 
lives against frivolous lawsuits. We 
will preserve accountability in the 
event of gross negligence or intentional 
misconduct, but we are not going to let 
trial lawyers throw a party on the 
backs of the frontline workers and in-
stitutions that have fought this new 
enemy on the frontlines. 
Health, economic assistance, liabil-
ity, 
and 
schools—another 
historic 
package for the next phase of this his-
toric national fight. 
To make a law, bipartisan talks need 
to come next. So there is one big ques-
tion facing the country right now: 
Which version of our distinguished 
Democratic colleagues are the Amer-
ican people about to get? Are we going 
to get the Democratic Party we got in 
March, when our colleagues met us in 
good-faith negotiations and worked 
with us to turn our framework into a 
bipartisan 
product—the 
Democrats 
who helped us pass the largest rescue 
package in American history without 
one dissenting vote—or will the coun-
try get the Democratic Party we saw 
in June, when our colleagues refused to 
suggest amendments or improvements 
to Senator TIM SCOTT’s police reform 
bill and chose to block the issue alto-
gether? 
Their actions last month left some 
observers 
wondering 
whether 
the 
Democrats 
had 
made 
this 
cynical 
choice to give up on bipartisan legisla-
tion altogether right through Novem-
ber, whether the Democrats had deter-
mined that strengthening our Nation 
with bipartisan action might hurt their 
political odds and, therefore, it might 
suit their fortunes better if pain and 
chaos simply continued. I hope that is 
completely off base. I know our Demo-
cratic colleagues know this crisis is 
still urgent. I know they know Amer-
ican families need more help. 
I hope this strong proposal will occa-
sion a real response, not partisan cheap 
shots, not the predictable, tired, old 
rhetoric as though these were ordinary 
times and the Nation could afford ordi-
nary politics. We cannot have a Senate 
minority decide in June it is done leg-
islating until November. The pandemic 
is not finished. The economic pain is 
not finished, so Congress cannot be fin-
ished either.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, a 
short time ago, a ceremony honoring 
the life of the great Representative 
John Lewis was held in the Capitol Ro-
tunda—the first time in our Nation’s 
history that an African-American law-
maker had laid in state. 
Last week, I shared my reflections on 
the life and legacy of John Lewis here 
on the floor. In the story of America, 
John was one of those special heroes 
whose moral clarity shown out like a 
beacon for others to follow, a North 
Star who inspired his fellow Americans 
to join him in the glorious work of per-
fecting our Union. 
Today, as we honor his extraordinary 
life here in the Capitol, many of us— 
his friends, his colleagues—are filled 
with a deep sense of loss, but I want to 
share a short message of hope. It seems 
easy to forget that John Lewis was just 
a teenager when he started the work of 
‘‘redeeming the soul of America,’’ as he 
put it. He was 18 years old when he 
first met Dr. King, 21 when he was ar-
rested as a freedom fighter, 25 when he 
was beaten bloody on a Sunday in 
Selma. 
The fight for civil rights has always 
been driven by the righteous indigna-
tion of our young people, and our time 
is no different. Once again, young peo-
ple across the country are rising in a 
mighty 
movement 
for 
justice 
and 
equality, supported by the vast major-
ity of Americans. The memory and leg-
acy of John Lewis’s life lives on in each 
and every one of them, and that fills 
me with hope. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, on a very different 
subject, over the past several months, 
Senate Democrats have been appalled 
that our Republican colleagues have 
refused to work with us in any signifi-
cant way to help defeat COVID–19 or 
provide relief to Americans during 
these unprecedented times. 
We do not understand how, faced 
with the greatest economic threat in 75 
years and the greatest public health 
threat in a century, the Senate Repub-
lican majority was content to do al-
most nothing for 3 long months, as 
more people died, more were thrown 
out of work, more small businesses 
went under. 
Last week, finally, our Republican 
colleagues said they were coming out 
with a plan, but even after all the 
delay, even after Leader MCCONNELL 
put the Senate on pause for 3 months, 
Senate Republicans and the White 
House were so unprepared and so di-
vided, they couldn’t even agree on a 
proposal 
among 
themselves. 
Ten 
weeks—ten 
weeks 
after 
Democrats 
passed a comprehensive bill through 
the House, Senate Republicans couldn’t 
even agree on what to throw on the 
wall. 
Last week was a slow-motion train 
wreck on the Republican side. It 
couldn’t have come at a worse time, 
and it will cause immense and, poten-
tially, irrevocable damage to our coun-
try. 
Protections against evictions expired 
last week, at a time when over 12 mil-
lion persons lived in households that 
missed the rent payment last month. 
Enhanced unemployment benefits for 
20 to 30 million Americans out of work 
expire this week, without a proper so-
lution. 
No matter what we do, States will 
not be able to quickly restart any en-
hanced unemployment benefits because 
Senate Republicans dithered for what 
seems like an eternity. 
We are on the precipice of several 
cliffs—destructive cliffs—for one rea-
son and one reason only: The White 
House and Senate Republicans couldn’t 
get their act together and wasted pre-
cious time. 
These issues could have been solved 
months ago, but the lack of any ur-
gency and understanding and empathy 
for people who need help from Senate 
Republicans has led us to a very pre-
carious moment. 
Today, it seems, we may finally see 
the Republican proposal on the next 
phase of COVID relief. Who knows if we 
will see legislative text or just an out-
line. It also appears the Republican 
proposal will not be an actual, coher-
ent bill but rather a series of small, 
piecemeal ideas. That is a metaphor for 
their first 100 days: lack of unity. They 
can’t even put one bill together—they 
are so divided—so a few Senators put in 
this one, a few Senators put in that 
one, a few Senators put in another one. 
Not only do we not know if the Presi-
dent supports any of these proposals, 
we don’t even know if Senate Repub-
licans fully support them. 
Yesterday, the Republican chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee said half of 
the Republican caucus will vote no on 
any additional stimulus. 
The greatest crisis America has faced 
in close to a century on health, 75 
years on the economy, and our Repub-
lican 
colleagues 
can’t 
even 
agree 
among themselves about what to do 
and have put out a few piecemeal 
pieces that don’t come close to doing 
the job. 
We have waited months—months for 
the Republican COVID relief bill, and it 
turns out we will not even get a bill, 
and Republicans probably will not sup-
port it. 
Worse still, based on reports and 
Leader MCCONNELL’s speech just now, 
the Republican legislative response to 
COVID–19 is totally inadequate. It will 
not include food assistance for hungry 
kids—kids, whose parents can’t feed 
them. They say no relief. How hard- 
hearted. How cruel. Is it that those 
wealthy, rightwing people who don’t 
want to pay any taxes say kids 
shouldn’t eat? Because the private sec-
tor ain’t doing it. You need the govern-
ment. 
Hazard pay for essential workers, 
risking their lives for us—what about 
funding for State and local and Tribal 
governments? Their budgets are in the 
tank. 
We 
are 
approaching 
a 
new 
month. Many, many, many essential 
workers will be laid off—busdrivers and 
sanitation workers and firefighters. 
The Republican proposal will ignore 
not one or two or three but scores of 
major crises in America right now. 
In addition, based on what the leader 
has said, the Republican proposal will 
not go nearly far enough, even in the 
pieces they try to do something with— 
the small number, the disparate num-
ber, the unaggregated number—since 
each piece seems to be separate be-
cause they can’t seem to get agreement 
among themselves. 
When it comes to our schools, the Re-
publican proposal does not provide 
enough resources for them to reopen 
safely. 
Major League Baseball, an organiza-
tion with vastly more resources than 
the average school district, has taken 
great pains to restart its season safely, 
and yet we learned today that 13 play-
ers and staff on 1 team alone have con-
tracted the coronavirus. 
How can Republicans ask our schools 
to protect the safety of our children 
without the necessary resources or 
guidance, when multibillion-dollar in-
dustries like baseball are having trou-
ble doing it? And are they just afraid of 
President 
Trump, 
who 
wants 
the 
schools to open without any help, for 
whatever is in his own head, which 
isn’t about the safety of America? The 
plan is totally inadequate. 
It appears that Senate Republicans 
have finally come around to the fact 
that the Democratic position on ex-
tending the moratorium on evictions 
or it may be just the moratorium on 
foreclosures—we will see what is in the 
proposal. They have come around to 
that, but they don’t support helping 
Americans actually afford the rent or 
their next mortgage payment. That 
makes no sense. 
We can prevent landlords or banks 
from kicking Americans out of their 
homes for another 6 months, but what 
then? Those same Americans may be 6 
months behind on their rent or mort-
gage. They will have no hope of making 
up the difference. 
And what will the landlords do? Not 
all landlords are big companies. Some 
of them, just like in my neighborhood, 
are landlords of a two- or three-family 
house. If no one can pay the rent, that 
hurts them too. How are they going to 
pay for heat or electricity? 
It is essential that we do what is in 
the Democratic Heroes Act and provide 
money to pay the rent or the mort-
gages for those thrown out of work, 
through no fault of their own, with no 
income.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4494 
July 27, 2020 
The Heroes Act provides $100 billion 
to help renters pay the rent; $75 billion 
to help homeowners pay the mortgage. 
The Heroes Act would prevent another 
housing crisis in America. The Repub-
lican proposal, assuming they even ad-
dress housing issues, would only delay 
a catastrophe a few months. 
The greatest deficiency in the Repub-
lican proposal may be their plan for 
unemployment insurance. According to 
reports, the White House and Senate 
want to extend the enhanced unem-
ployment benefits the Democrats se-
cured in the CARES Act but only pro-
vide a percentage of a worker’s former 
wage. 
There are four reasons this is a ter-
rible policy. 
First, it would hurt the unemployed. 
If you lost your job through no fault of 
your own, Republicans want you to 
take a 30-percent pay cut. Can you be-
lieve that? You have lost your job; you 
can’t get to work; the administration 
has bungled this crisis; and now they 
want to take $1,600 out of your pocket 
every single month, blaming the vic-
tim—blaming the victim. 
Maybe, again, some of those Repub-
lican, hard-right money people who 
don’t want to pay taxes to help any-
body, don’t want the Federal Govern-
ment to help anybody. Let me tell you, 
my Republican friends, you can’t do 
this without the Federal Government 
and the Federal Government’s re-
sources. The private sector can’t take 
care of this on their own. That is one 
reason. 
Second, it would exacerbate poverty. 
A recent study showed the enhanced 
benefits have prevented 12 million 
Americans from slipping into poverty. 
It has probably been the greatest anti- 
poverty program that we have had in a 
very, very long time. Why on Earth 
would we slash and burn benefits keep-
ing American families out of poverty? 
Third, it will devastate our economy. 
One of the few things that has this 
economy not getting worse is that peo-
ple have money in their pockets to buy 
goods. Consumer spending is going up. 
Do you know why, my Republican 
friends? In large part because of the 
generous benefit in the pandemic un-
employment insurance. Mark Zandi 
and other great economists have said 
just that—just that. 
Consumer purchases are helping the 
economy from getting worse. There is 
money in the pockets of consumers to 
help them pay the bills and shop in 
stores and more. What do our Repub-
lican friends want to do? Cut the bene-
fits to Americans who are spending the 
money as soon as they get it, taking 
one of the few policies stimulating the 
economy off the table. 
That is why an analysis from re-
spected 
economic 
forecasters 
at 
Moody’s—hardly a political organiza-
tion—say that reducing these benefits 
or letting them expire could cost over 
a million jobs—a million more jobs this 
year. 
And 
fourth 
and 
finally, 
the 
ideologues here get together and come 
up with a plan, and it doesn’t work. It 
is going to be impossible to implement. 
Republicans, at the last minute, 
while they waited and waited and wait-
ed—3 weeks ago Speaker PELOSI and I 
wrote to Leader MCCONNELL and said: 
Sit down and talk to us now. We heard 
nothing. 
So they waited and waited and wait-
ed until they are up to the cliff, and 
now they come up with an entirely new 
system, where States would have to 
calculate a different benefit for each 
individual worker. Well, the implemen-
tations will be a nightmare. 
Let me read you—my office called 
some 
State 
unemployment 
offices 
about this Republican proposal. 
A medium-size State on the west 
coast: It would take months. We don’t 
even have a way of calculating the 
wages of individuals. We are not 
equipped to do anything but a flat 
amount. Need a serious transition pe-
riod. Even changing the dollar amount 
would take 2 to 4 weeks—2 to 4 weeks 
where people have no money. 
Another Southeastern State, medium 
size again: Very difficult. This State 
said: We need public statements from 
the Feds that people will not be able to 
get benefits for many weeks or months. 
Need to be realistic so our offices 
aren’t overwhelmed. Even if you do a 
clean $600, you have to reapply in our 
State. 
From a small State in the North-
east—these are workers, people in the 
Governor’s offices or the unemploy-
ment offices: 
Even clean extensions of FPUC [that is 
pandemic uninsurance] will take weeks to 
implement. Can’t even speculate how long it 
would take to do wage replacement. Will not 
have to reapply for a clean $600, but it will 
take weeks to do retroactive payments. 
From three States—a very big State 
in the West, a big State in the Mid-
west, and a smaller State in the West: 
It would take many months. This 
would cause chaos with our constitu-
ents. 
From a Great Plains State: 2 months 
minimum to implement. 
From a big State in the Northeast, 
smaller State in the West: 8 weeks or 
more to implement. 
From a small State in the West: 
We have turned off the $600 FPUC effective 
benefit week ending July 25, per law. Any 
claims not decided prior to that date will 
still have benefit of [the] FPUC if found eli-
gible. Any claims filed yesterday forward 
would not. As for options, another flat 
amount is best. 
From a large State in the East: 
Extension of $600, could be seamless. Lower 
flat, will take time. Percentage of wages is 
impossible. 
Chaos. Chaos. If you change the un-
employment benefit, it is going to take 
weeks if not months for most people to 
get it. The economy crashes. People 
are hurt. They get kicked out of their 
homes, and they can’t feed their kids. 
What are you doing? 
The Republican proposal on unem-
ployment benefits, simply put, is un-
workable. It will delay benefits for 
weeks, if not months, as we slide into 
a greater degree of recession. 
By the way, the idea that we need to 
drastically reduce these benefits be-
cause workers will stay home other-
wise 
is 
greatly 
exaggerated. 
Most 
Americans are not going to quit their 
jobs, forgo benefits and a steady salary 
in order to receive temporary unem-
ployment benefits. That is what lead-
ing economists have said. These bene-
fits are a lifeline to tens of millions 
who want to work, are ready to work, 
but can’t find work because there 
aren’t jobs for them. The vast majority 
of these people don’t have a job to go 
to. 
Let’s face it, folks. Our country is in 
the middle of multiple crises. Tens of 
millions of Americans are jobless. 
American families are struggling to 
keep food on the table and a roof over 
their heads. Nearly 150,000 Americans 
have 
died—a 
stunning 
and 
heart-
breaking loss of life—and, in response, 
Senate Republicans have presented us 
with a half-hearted, half-baked legisla-
tive proposal. 
In short, the Republican plan is too 
little, too late. The Republican plan is 
weak tea when our problems need a 
much stronger brew. 
I heard Leader MCCONNELL’s ‘‘Alice 
in Wonderland’’ interpretation of what 
happened in the last 3 months. The 
first bill, he says, was the way we 
should go. Well, let’s remember what 
happened. Republicans put their own 
bill on the floor; Democrats said no. 
Then, finally, you folks came to the 
table, negotiated with us, and the bill 
is far more a Democratic bill than a 
Republican bill. You know that, and we 
know that. 
On the other hand, the other alter-
native, which the leader referred to as 
the Justice in Policing Act, was totally 
partisan. 
Sometimes I am amazed at the words 
the Republican leader can use. He says 
that he wants to be nonpartisan, and 
our bill is a socialist manifesto. Well, 
which one is it? Which one is it? 
Here is what we should do. Repub-
licans should scrap their approach. We 
don’t even know how many are for— 
and what pieces. They should use the 
Heroes 
Act—comprehensive, 
strong, 
and bold for negotiations—and start 
talking with Democrats in a serious 
way about the real problems our coun-
try is facing. 
Again, this is a serious, serious cri-
sis. It is the biggest health crisis in 100 
years, the biggest economic crisis in 75. 
The Republican mantra to let the pri-
vate sector do it is just not going to 
work. You have to understand that the 
times are different. The crisis is real. 
We need an active, bold series of gov-
ernment programs—not just cutting 
and cutting and eliminating and elimi-
nating—to solve our health problems 
and get the economy out of the morass. 
We Democrats have been waiting to 
negotiate with our Republican col-
leagues for more than 2 months. I am

bitterly disappointed and frustrated by 
their delay and now by the inadequacy 
of their product. We need to imme-
diately 
enter 
into 
bipartisan, 
bi-
cameral negotiations to develop a bill 
that actually matches the scale of the 
crisis and the needs of the American 
people. 
Speaker PELOSI this morning called 
on Leader MCCONNELL
and Leader 
MCCARTHY and representatives of the 
President to join me and her in the 
Speaker’s office half an hour after the 
Republican bill is released. Repub-
licans in the House and Senate must 
join us. We are running out of time. 
The Senate Republicans just ran down 
the clock and tossed an air ball. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. About half an hour 
ago, Leader MCCONNELL gave an out-
line of the bill that will be before the 
Senate in regard to carrying on where 
the CARES Act left off. Those of us 
who are chairmen of various commit-
tees or have input into this process 
would like to go into some detail—but 
not in-depth detail—of our parts of the 
bill. I am chairman of the Senate Fi-
nance Committee, and within our juris-
diction, our proposals take on several 
issues facing Americans during the cri-
sis. 
For unemployment insurance, we 
boost the Federal Government’s reim-
bursement to local governments and 
nonprofits to 75 percent, up from 50 
percent in the first CARES Act. We do 
that to prevent further layoffs from 
local governments and nonprofit orga-
nizations. 
In the same legislation we maintain 
some of the current boosted benefits, 
but we must also responsibly hone 
those programs to target help where it 
is really needed. 
Our bill transitions from a flat rate 
to a replacement of 70 percent of lost 
wages for people who have become un-
employed. This is a much more respon-
sible approach that we didn’t have time 
to work out in the first CARES Act. 
Regardless, the boosted unemployment 
benefit is significantly more than 
Democratic Senate and Democratic 
Presidents approved in the 2009 eco-
nomic crisis, which, by the way, was 
only an additional $25 a month when 
we had the worst recession in this 
country since the Great Depression of 
the 1930s. 
So I heard people cry just a few min-
utes ago about our not doing enough. It 
doesn’t make sense to do what we knew 
we were doing wrong, but we had to do 
it to get help out to the people who 
were 
unemployed. 
For 
the 
last 
4 
months, we were paying out of the Fed-
eral Treasury $600 a week, in addition 
to what each State would pay for those 
unemployed. In other words, we have 
learned what we knew at the time— 
that when you pay people more not to 
work than they would get working, 
what do you expect? People will not 
work. 
What this country needs is more 
workers. If we are going to get this 
country turned around, it is not going 
to come from money from unemploy-
ment to individuals because govern-
ment doesn’t create wealth; it only 
consumes wealth. If you want to create 
a bigger economic pie for everybody, 
more workers are going to be necessary 
for a bigger economic pie. 
Going to our tax provisions in this 
same bill, our tax provisions aim to 
help Americans get back to work and 
help businesses safely open. We expand 
access to the CARES Act employment 
tax credit for small and medium-sized 
businesses. We expand the work oppor-
tunity tax credit for larger employers 
hiring people currently receiving un-
employment compensation. We also 
provide a new credit for expenses, like 
personal 
protective 
equipment 
and 
cleaning needed to maintain a safe and 
healthy workplace for employees and 
for customers. The Republican plan 
provides for another round of $1,200 
economic impact payments for most 
American adults, but we also include in 
the additional $500 for each depend-
ent—some people we didn’t intend to 
leave out last time, but we did. So re-
gardless of age, some of these depend-
ents will now be helped. 
For healthcare providers we relax the 
terms of loans received from Medicare. 
We ensure that Medicare telehealth op-
tions don’t expire before Congress can 
determine what should be made perma-
nent. We extend for 5 years the CARES 
Act provision that pays clinics and 
health centers for telehealth to provide 
a downpayment on meeting healthcare 
needs in rural America, and we help by 
freezing Medicare premiums at 2020 
levels to head off a predicted spike 
next year that would otherwise happen 
to senior citizens. We also assist nurs-
ing home patients and workers. 
State and local governments have 
also asked for Federal help. Our pro-
posal extends the timeframe in which 
governments can utilize the $150 billion 
in funding provided under the first 
CARES Act by also providing more 
flexibility and allowing some funds to 
be used to cover revenue shortfalls. 
This proposal sets out a responsible, 
holistic approach to address the prob-
lems our country faces. I hope my 
Democratic colleagues are interested 
in compromise and solutions for the 
benefit of all of the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as 
we continue to work on supporting our 
country’s recovery from the COVID–19 
crisis, one critical piece of the CARES 
2 legislation is liability reform. 
Across the country we are seeing 
lawsuits rolling in, targeting the very 
healthcare workers who are on the 
frontlines performing essential work 
for patients suffering from the COVID– 
19 virus. We are seeing lawsuits focus-
ing on nursing homes, universities, 
nonprofit 
businesses—you 
name 
it. 
Without action from Congress, the liti-
gation epidemic will potentially sink 
the very businesses and enterprises 
that 
we 
hoped 
we 
could 
sustain 
through this crisis. 
Today, Leader MCCONNELL and I in-
troduced the Safe to Work Act, which 
will ensure that those operating in 
good faith and following all the rel-
evant guidelines cannot be sued out of 
existence. 
To be clear, this is not a blanket li-
ability shield. It will not prevent bad 
actors from facing the consequences of 
their actions when they are intentional 
or reckless. It will not ban coronavirus 
lawsuits, and it will not give anyone a 
‘‘get out of jail free’’ card. 
What it will do, though, is put safe-
guards in place that will prevent oppor-
tunistic lawsuits from harming the 
workers and institutions we are de-
pending on to see us through this cri-
sis. 
First and foremost are protections 
for our incredible healthcare heroes 
who made the tremendous physical and 
mental sacrifices over the last few 
months. This legislation sets a willful 
misconduct or gross negligence stand-
ard for coronavirus-related medical li-
ability suits to ensure that only meri-
torious cases are brought against our 
healthcare workers. 
I would add that the costs of litiga-
tion itself can be enough to put some-
body out of business, even though you, 
in the end, ‘‘win’’ the lawsuit. The cost 
of defending a case that you ultimately 
win can be so big that it will put you 
out of business by itself. 
In 
addition 
to 
protecting 
our 
healthcare heroes, we need to ensure 
that fear of lawsuits does not prevent 
our schools, nonprofits, small busi-
nesses, and a range of other organiza-
tions and institutions that are vital to 
our communities from opening their 
doors. This will spell out in black and 
white that these entities will be pro-
tected from COVID–19 exposure claims 
as long as they have made a good-faith 
effort to comply with mandatory pub-
lic health guidelines. 
By the way, a number of States have 
already provided similar protections, 
including the minority leader’s State 
of New York, and it is time we extend 
these liability limitations to the rest 
in the country. This is not a red State 
or blue State issue. We are all in this 
together, and that is why red State and 
blue State legislators and Governors 
have already acted in a similar fashion 
to what I am describing here. 
In order for our country to recover, 
the workers and institutions we depend 
on now need to know with confidence 
that if they are operating in good faith 
and obeying health guidelines, they are 
not going to become victims of a feed-
ing frenzy. This legislation will provide 
that confidence, and I hope my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle will 
join me in supporting these common-
sense reforms. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4496 
July 27, 2020 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from South 
Carolina. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, as we continue our efforts to 
tackle the effects of COVID–19, both in 
terms of healthcare and the economic 
fallout, CARES 2 could be a critical 
piece to the puzzle. 
Americans continue to mask up, so-
cial distance, and do what we can do as 
individuals to slow the spread of the 
virus. Here, in the Senate, we know 
that we must find additional ways to 
keep our people as healthy as possible 
while we reopen our economy as safely 
as we can. 
We also know that low wage and 
service industry workers have taken 
the hardest economic hit from the 
virus. This stems, in part, from res-
taurants either being closed or oper-
ating at a limited capacity. In April, 
one out of four individuals to lose their 
jobs lost their jobs in the restaurant 
industry. That is 5.5 million Americans 
who lost their jobs in the restaurant 
business. 
While those losses have certainly 
begun to recover, and even as our res-
taurants adjust and innovate to find 
new ways to serve customers, there is 
no doubt they need some additional 
help. That is why I worked on the pro-
vision in this legislation that will pro-
vide a 100-percent deduction for busi-
ness meals—up from 50 percent. 
We know that through outdoor din-
ing, carryout, delivery, and, in some 
places around the country, limited in-
door dining, we can keep folks safe. 
This incentive will lead to more orders 
that will translate into more take- 
home pay and more hours for wait staff 
and kitchen staff and more revenues 
for millions of small businesses. That 
is a great thing and an easy thing to 
accomplish with this simple provision. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the 
Paycheck Protection Program of for-
givable loans has been a lifeline to mil-
lions of our small businesses and their 
employees. According to a recent cen-
sus survey, more than 76 percent of 
Maine’s small businesses reported re-
ceiving a PPP loan. An estimated 
240,000 Maine jobs have been supported 
by this critically important program, 
which has brought more than $2.2 bil-
lion to our State. Nationwide, more 
than 5 million small employers have 
received PPP loans. 
When Senators RUBIO, CARDIN, SHA-
HEEN, and I developed this program 
back in March, we had no idea how 
long economic closures to mitigate the 
spread of COVID–19 would last. Many 
small businesses have made consider-
able investments in personal protective 
equipment and facility modifications 
to operate safely during the pandemic 
and yet are still only able to operate at 
a fraction of their previous capacity. 
In fact, I talked to an innkeeper in 
Maine just this morning who told me 
that in normal times, at this point in 
the summer, his inn would be nearly 
full every single night, but this July 
his business is down by 93 percent. 
The bill that Senator RUBIO and I are 
introducing would allow the hardest 
hit small employers—those whose rev-
enue has declined by 50 percent or even 
more—to receive a second PPP forgiv-
able loan. And to ensure that we are 
targeting assistance to the employers 
that need help the most, we limit those 
second loans to small businesses with 
300 or fewer employees. 
Our bill would also expand forgivable 
PPP expenses to include investments 
needed to protect both employees and 
customers, such as masks, plexiglass 
shields, and improved HVAC systems. 
This could include, for example, the ex-
pense of expanding outdoor seating, 
which is especially important to res-
taurants that are still under dining re-
strictions. 
We include a number of other impor-
tant provisions, such as allowing sea-
sonal businesses more flexibility in cal-
culating their loan amounts and sim-
plifying the loan forgiveness process 
for smaller borrowers. 
I hope that our proposal will help ad-
vance bipartisan negotiations to ex-
tend this vital program before August 
8, when applications will no longer be 
accepted. There are so many small em-
ployers and their employees who have 
been kept afloat by the first PPP loan 
they received but need a second one to 
survive this persistent pandemic. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, to follow 
up on Senator COLLINS’ outline of the 
second round of PPP, I think it is im-
portant, first, to remind everybody 
how we got to this place. 
The goal, when we did it the first 
time, was to not only allow small busi-
nesses to survive what was then uncer-
tain as to how long it would take but 
also to keep their workers attached to 
employment. We know how devastating 
it is to a family and to an individual 
when they get disconnected from em-
ployment, and, by and large, we believe 
the program has been incredibly suc-
cessful. But it has room for improve-
ment, and we have learned from those 
things along the way with some of the 
different changes that were made in 
providing more flexibility and the like. 
This new program comes at a timely 
moment because we are now beginning 
to see that as the PPP funds are being 
exhausted, some companies are having 
to face, once again, the potential of 
having to lay off some of their workers. 
That is why it is time for a second 
round of PPP assistance. 
A lot of the provisions will be very 
familiar. You have heard them al-
ready—the 21⁄2 percent payroll and so 
forth—but some are new because we 
really wanted this to be more targeted. 
That is why there is the 300-employee- 
or-less standard, and you have to have 
50 percent or more of revenue reduc-
tion. 
We also understand that some com-
munities have been harder hit, for a va-
riety of different reasons, and espe-
cially the sort of microbusinesses—the 
smaller ones. Some of these funds will 
be set aside for employers that have 10 
employees or less, to make sure that 
the money doesn’t run out without 
that group of small businesses getting 
the assistance they need. 
In addition, we know that minority 
and underserved small businesses have 
been disproportionately impacted by 
the lockdowns that we have seen. Many 
of them, obviously, often lack signifi-
cant cash reserves. They historically 
face challenges being able to get tradi-
tional means of capital. So, as part of 
this proposal, separate from PPP and 
in addition to it, we are proposing an 
additional type of loan that would be 
longer term, more targeted, and at low 
interest, designated for small busi-
nesses that are either seasonal employ-
ers or located in low-income commu-
nities and have 500 or fewer employees. 
It provides them flexible long-term 
working capital to help ensure that 
these most vulnerable and underserved 
small businesses don’t go out of busi-
ness because of the pandemic but al-
lows them to borrow up to two times 
their annual revenues on a 20-year loan 
term at 1 percent interest. 
Again, don’t confuse that with PPP. 
This is a separate target product to try 
to help those who are in low-income 
neighborhoods, as defined by their cen-
sus track. So, consider, for example, a 
small business with $400,000. A 5-year 
loan at 71⁄2 percent interest rate, that 
today would be equal to $8,000 monthly 
payments. But if they are able to refi-
nance that existing loan at 1 percent, 
the payments fall to $1,840. So it is an 
additional amount of assistance. 
The bottom line is that we all recog-
nize the importance of small business. 
We should all recognize that this is not 
a bailout. These are viable businesses, 
and the only reason they are struggling 
is because the government has stepped 
in—like it does, for example, in emi-
nent domain—and said: For the public 
good, it is important for us to infringe 
upon your right to make money and 
conduct business. 
I think when government does that 
in the public good, just like in eminent 
domain, the government also has an 
obligation to step forward and help 
these companies from going out of 
business. Otherwise, we will lose not 
just the backbone of our economy but 
the millions of jobs that come with it, 
and the impact would be catastrophic. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Utah.

July 27, 2020 
fight the coronavirus and to mitigate 
its 
impact 
on 
American 
families, 
schools, and businesses. I want to brief-
ly highlight some of the main provi-
sions. They have probably been talked 
about already this afternoon. 
First, $6 billion goes for States to 
ramp up testing, with a particular em-
phasis on schools, employers, childcare 
facilities, and nursing homes. 
Second, $26 billion goes for the devel-
opment and distribution of vaccines, 
therapeutics, and diagnostics. We have 
made meaningful progress on each of 
these fronts, but we haven’t gotten 
there yet, as we all know. 
Third, there is $105 billion for the 
Education Stabilization Fund to help 
schools adapt to the circumstances 
they face, which are extraordinary. 
The CDC has emphasized the impor-
tance of getting kids back into school 
and has issued guidelines on how to do 
so safely. That is why this legislation 
provides additional funding for K–12 
schools to get kids back into the class-
room at least 50 percent of the time, 
which would be a big start. We recog-
nize they will incur additional expense 
if they reopen safely, and we have to 
try to provide for that. 
The fourth point I want to highlight 
briefly here is $20 billion in additional 
assistance for our Nation’s farmers and 
our ranchers. 
The fifth and final point: nearly $30 
billion to bolster the U.S. defense in-
dustrial base, which is important to all 
of us. We must never take our eyes off 
the ball there. These resources will pre-
vent furloughs of thousands of employ-
ees from across the country who help 
Americans stay safe. 
I can go on and on, but time is mov-
ing on here this afternoon. We realize 
this is just the first step. We have to 
work together. We have to work in a 
bipartisan fashion here and put Amer-
ica first. 
We know the House has some high 
numbers. We have good numbers, I be-
lieve. I look forward to some bipartisan 
help on this and moving these bills 
along. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
thank Senator WYDEN for his courtesy 
in allowing me to go next. I will be suc-
cinct. 
The way to get back to work and 
back to school is to put politics aside 
and work together, as we have been 
doing, on the COVID–19 response and 
see whether we can get a result for the 
American people in the next couple of 
weeks. 
The part of the Safely Back to Work 
and Back to School Act that I am in-
troducing today does four things. 
First, if you are one of 43 million 
Americans with a student loan, it helps 
you manage your debt. This is the way 
it does it: If you have no income, you 
have no monthly payment. If you re-
member, in March, we said to the 43 
million Americans with student debt: 
You can defer your payment until Oc-
tober 1. Well, that is just around the 
corner. What we would propose is, you 
don’t have to pay it after October 1 if 
you have no income. If you do have in-
come, your monthly payment will 
never be more than 10 percent of your 
income after deducting the necessities 
of life, such as rent, mortgage, or food. 
No. 2, if you are a parent, this bill 
gives your child more choices of 
schools, provides scholarships so that 
your child can return to the private 
school he or she attended before the 
pandemic, and gives other students a 
new opportunity to attend private 
school. Senator TIM SCOTT introduced 
that legislation earlier. I am a cospon-
sor. 
No. 3, if you are a working mom or 
dad, it helps you find childcare so you 
can go back to work. A lot of our 
childcare centers operate on a very 
thin margin. They have reduced rev-
enue because they don’t have as many 
clients these days. Senator BLUNT’s bill 
and Senator SHELBY’s appropriations 
bill will provide money so that they 
can stay open and provide safe environ-
ments to two-thirds of the children in 
the United States under age 6 who have 
parents in the workforce. 
Finally, our bill—the part I am intro-
ducing—improves the Strategic Na-
tional Stockpile so that we can main-
tain 
adequate 
supplies 
of 
masks, 
gloves, protective equipment, as well 
as onshore manufacturing capacity for 
tests, treatments, and vaccines that we 
are building now. We want to make 
sure that it doesn’t go away and we 
have to rely on other countries in 
other parts of the world. 
This legislation is about children, 
jobs, and healthcare. 
As far as schools go, there are 100,000 
public 
schools 
and 
35,000 
private 
schools in our country. There are about 
5 million students in the private 
schools and 50 million in the public 
schools. Every one of those children is 
a treasure. I have worked with Senator 
BLUNT
to help the country’s 135,000 
schools and 6,000 colleges have the 
money they need to open with as many 
students physically present as is con-
sistent with safety. 
The Safely Back to Work and Back 
to School Act poses making $70 billion 
available for schools; another $30 bil-
lion for colleges. That means roughly 
$1,200 per student for public and private 
schools across the country. One-third 
of the money would be distributed 
automatically to all 135,000 schools. 
That is probably about $400 a student— 
a significant amount of money. Two- 
thirds of the money would go to 
schools that are opening with students 
physically present to help pay for the 
extra costs of providing that instruc-
tion in a safe environment. If they are 
trying to open with students physically 
present, it makes logical sense to say 
that if they have to have more buses, if 
they have to hire more teachers, if 
they have to have more protective 
equipment, then those schools need 
more help paying for that. 
There will be more funding, as Sen-
ator SHELBY mentioned, to help con-
tain this sneaky, dangerous virus and 
give Americans more opportunity for 
access to healthcare. There is more 
funding in this overall legislation for 
testing, for the National Institutes of 
Health, community health centers, the 
distribution of vaccines, and to extend 
the expansion of teleservice activities 
that has happened during the pan-
demic. 
This legislation reflects our Nation’s 
priorities, which are safely back to 
school, safely back to childcare, and 
safely back to work. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that following the 
remarks of my Republican colleagues, 
Senators BROWN, MURPHY, and I be per-
mitted to speak for up to 7 minutes 
each and that the previously scheduled 
votes occur following the remarks of 
those listed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is 
my pleasure to introduce the Restoring 
Critical Supply Chains and Intellectual 
Property Act. 
China looms large in this debate 
about the coronavirus. That is where 
the virus originated. The lying and de-
ceptive behavior of the Chinese Com-
munist Party has brought this pan-
demic to the world. It is the third pan-
demic to come out of China. I think it 
is now time for us to get serious about 
our dependency on China. 
What does this legislation do? It has 
four components. 
The protective equipment that our 
nurses and doctors and all healthcare 
workers use to protect themselves on 
the frontlines—90 percent of it is made 
in China. We are going to try to bring 
it back home. We have a ‘‘Buy Amer-
ican’’ requirement in this bill—a $7.5 
billion tax credit to reenergize Amer-
ican production of PPE equipment. 
We are trying to get PPE under the 
Berry amendment of the Defense bill. 
We require our uniforms for our mili-
tary to be made in America to the ex-
tent possible. We are going to try to 
create PPE in the same category as a 
national security item. 
There will be a $7.5 billion tax credit 
to jump-start this industry. A lot of 
good jobs will come from this, and we 
will be less dependent on China when it 
comes to protective equipment. 
I will discuss Senator PORTMAN’s leg-
islation, Safeguarding American Inno-
vation Act, which is included, Senator 
CORNYN’s CHIPS for America Act, and 
Senator MURKOWSKI’s American Min-
eral Security Act very quickly.

dustry. A Taiwanese firm made a big

decision to come to America—I think 
in Texas—a Taiwanese semiconductors 
company. We are trying to incentivize 
their relocation into the United States 
and jump-start a semiconductor indus-
try that has left the country. It is very 
important for the future of our econ-
omy. 
Senator 
PORTMAN’s 
Safeguarding 
American Innovation Act creates a 
Federal research council and institutes 
penalties for bad actors who come to 
the United States or are here to steal 
important 
intellectual 
property. 
I 
think we all know who we are talking 
about here. China leads the pack there, 
and you saw what happened in Hous-
ton. 
Senator MURKOWSKI’s American Min-
eral Security Act promotes secure and 
robust domestic supply chains of crit-
ical minerals by streamlining the per-
mitting process for extraction and em-
phasizing R&D into critical mineral re-
cycling and development. 
These four things together will pro-
tect our supply chain. It will bring it 
back to the country at a time when we 
need to have more say about our des-
tiny. The pandemic has been a wake-up 
call all over the board. There is noth-
ing more important to me than relo-
cating the medical supply chain and 
protecting the innovation that we are 
known for as a country. 
With that, I yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senate 
Republicans and the White House have 
finally come forward with an unem-
ployment insurance proposal. The Re-
publican proposal is not just mis-
guided; the Republican proposal is a 
punch in the gut and a slap in the face 
for the 30 million Americans relying on 
lifeline unemployment insurance bene-
fits. It adds insult to infection. 
Unemployment benefits—the ones we 
developed that ensure that people can 
pay the rent or buy groceries—are al-
ready expiring. The last payments 
went out Saturday. Senate Republicans 
and Donald Trump sat on their hands 
for months instead of working with 
Democrats, so now it appears that a 
lapse in benefits is inevitable. 
Republicans apparently have a pro-
posal that is just unworkable. You 
don’t have to take my word for it; the 
nonpartisan experts who run the State 
workforce agencies have told the Fi-
nance Committee that any changes, 
even simple ones, can take months to 
implement. Now Republicans are talk-
ing about cutting those lifeline bene-
fits—the ones that actually made it 
possible for folks to make rent and buy 
groceries and cover the cost of medi-
cine and car insurance. They are talk-
ing about cutting those benefits by 
two-thirds. They want States to make 
complicated changes to the unemploy-
ment insurance program that could 
hold up benefits until 2021. Some 
States are indicating that it is almost 
impossible to manage this altogether. 
The Republican proposal is cruel. In 
my view, it is legislative malpractice. 
For the life of me, I don’t know how 
anyone could possibly look at the state 
of our economy and decide that what is 
needed is even more economic pain for 
30 million Americans. It is especially 
insulting to America’s unemployed 
workers that Republicans want to cut 
their economic lifeline in the same bill 
that is going to give a taxpayer subsidy 
to power lunches for lobbyists. 
My colleagues have been warned that 
State unemployment systems are al-
ready struggling to keep up. Some peo-
ple who were laid off months ago are 
still waiting to receive benefits. I read 
about one today who is following all of 
this from their hospital bed, where 
they are suffering from COVID–19. 
There are news reports about people 
sleeping in their cars just to have a 
shot at being at the head of the line at 
the workforce agency. 
Now Senate Republicans come for-
ward with a proposal that throws even 
more sand in the gears. They have been 
warned that this kind of proposal will 
be a disaster to implement. I know be-
cause I was in the Senate Finance 
room when they were told about it. 
My colleagues on the other side also 
are arguing that the biggest problem in 
America now is that there are all these 
lazy workers sitting at home collecting 
unemployment checks instead of going 
back to their jobs. There is no evi-
dence—not a shred—that this is hap-
pening in large numbers around the 
country. Come to me with one single 
story about somebody turning down 
work, and I will tell you about a dozen 
out-of-work Oregonians I have spoken 
to, folks who cannot wait—cannot 
wait—to get back to work, Oregonians 
and Americans who believe in the dig-
nity of work. 
There was a nationwide townhall 
meeting on Thursday last, with people 
who were unemployed, and people who 
were unemployed volunteered that, if 
they were told in the evening that they 
could work the next day, they would be 
there at the crack of dawn. It is insult-
ing to American workers to suggest 
they are a bunch of lazy freeloaders 
looking for a handout, but we have 
been hearing that time and again from 
those on the other side of the aisle who 
were simply unwilling to write any 
proposal at all. 
I believe the Republican proposal is 
also a prescription for disaster for our 
economy. Supercharged unemployment 
benefits 
may 
be 
the 
single 
most 
impactful 
program 
that 
Congress 
passed in response to the pandemic. 
What does it mean to cut it? The Re-
publican plan cuts unemployment ben-
efits by more than $10 billion per week. 
That opens up a terrible economic 
wound. It will be a huge setback right 
when the recovery seems to be stalling, 
even going in reverse. 
One new analysis says cutting bene-
fits down to $200 per week is going to 
lead to a loss of 3.4 million jobs. And 
Senate Republicans want Americans to 
believe that it is unemployed workers 
holding back the economy. 
I will close by saying it is long past 
time for my Republican colleagues to 
get serious about working with Demo-
crats on a proposal that has a pathway 
to actually becoming law and to help-
ing 
people. 
This 
Republican 
plan 
doesn’t do that. 
Just as I said on Thursday, we have 
been ready for months. The other body, 
the House of Representatives, passed a 
bill 2 months ago ensuring that Ameri-
cans have those funds to make rent, 
pay groceries, and pay for essentials. 
Leader SCHUMER and I introduced our 
plan: the American Workforce Rescue 
Act. 
So we were all set over here to go to 
work with Republicans before the ma-
jority leader sent everybody home on a 
2-week recess, when we thought it was 
important to be here and to work on 
these crucial economic issues I have 
mentioned. 
Benefits have lapsed. Tens of mil-
lions of Americans now walk an eco-
nomic tightrope every single week, bal-
ancing the rent bill against the food 
bill, the food bill against healthcare 
costs. 
There is no time to waste. Senate Re-
publicans need to work with us now on 
a proposal that ensures that Americans 
do not face yet another economic hit, 
as I mentioned, with some of them ac-
tually sitting in hospitals suffering 
from COVID–19 and wondering how 
they are going to pay the bills. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, Senator 
WYDEN is so right here. He fought back 
in March for $600 a week for unem-
ployed workers, which kept our econ-
omy going, which kept us from going 
into a worse recession, which made all 
the difference in the world for all these 
workers. 
Think about this. If we were to adopt 
their proposal—I think they have a 
proposal. We haven’t really seen very 
much yet. 
As Senator WYDEN said, the House 
passed a bill back in May. It has been 
May, June, and almost all of July. We 
have waited and waited and waited. 
Unemployed workers know that their 
unemployment expires at the end of 
July, yet Senator MCCONNELL sent us 
home, as Senator WYDEN said. They 
wait. We wait. We wait. Then they 
come up with this half-baked proposal 
that they don’t even know what it is 
exactly. 
But we do know one thing. We do 
know that workers who were laid off 
through no fault of their own, they 
want to work. Most Americans want to 
work. Those workers, their unemploy-
ment is cut from $600 to $200 a week. So 
we are essentially taking $400 from 
millions of workers in Connecticut and 
Pennsylvania, 
West 
Virginia, 
New 
York, Oregon, Ohio, Arkansas, and 
Utah. We are taking $400 a week from 
these workers at the same time that 
the moratorium on eviction expires, at 
the same time that eviction courts in 
the States open up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4499 
July 27, 2020 
In Columbus, OH—my State’s largest 
city—they are holding eviction courts 
in an arena because there are so many 
people who will be evicted if their un-
employment expires. In the middle of a 
pandemic, we are going to evict people, 
and they are going to go to over-
crowded homeless shelters; they are 
going to go to sleep in their cousins’ 
basements—in the middle of a pan-
demic. What is that going to do? 
I know the President just doesn’t 
think much about the pandemic. He 
has moved on to accusing who knows 
what, calling names, dividing and all 
that, and isn’t paying much attention 
to this pandemic. But, in the middle of 
a pandemic, to cut unemployment is 
just unbelievable. 
We know that, in their plan, there is 
a major cut in unemployment benefits; 
there is no rental assistance that will 
help people pay their rent; there is no 
expansion of the eviction moratorium. 
There is nothing. 
Senator MCCONNELL has had months 
to 
extend 
expanded 
unemployment 
benefits. He has had months to figure 
out what we are going to do on evic-
tions. Yet nothing. I don’t know, when 
I look down that hall—I don’t really 
know—I see lobbyists running out of 
there, asking Senator MCCONNELL to 
get what they get, and they do very 
well every time, apparently. 
Americans want to go back to work. 
People want to go to work, but they 
want to go back to work when it is 
safe. I want our schools to open, but I 
want our schools to open safely. 
President Trump, months into this 
pandemic, still has no plans to protect 
workers. There is one reason people are 
still out of work: President Trump’s 
failure to get this pandemic under con-
trol. 
Now, as they suggest we drop unem-
ployment from $600 to $200—it is not 
alarmist—people can lose their homes. 
A wave of evictions in the middle of 
this pandemic will set back millions of 
families. 
I know it is not something that Sen-
ators do very often, but try to put 
yourself in the shoes of someone who is 
laid off in Akron, OH, or in Eugene, 
OR, or in Hartford, CT. Someone is laid 
off. They get that $600. They can stay 
in their apartments—barely, but they 
can. 
They are paying attention—sort of— 
to what we do here. They do know that 
their unemployment expires at the end 
of July. Then they hear of no plan. 
The Democrats have said: Let’s ex-
tend the unemployment. Let’s do pro-
tections. Let’s do emergency rental as-
sistance. Let’s help our schools. Let’s 
help our local governments. Let’s make 
sure people have enough food on their 
tables. 
They hear nothing from the majority 
party, and people are now beginning to 
understand that maybe the Senate is 
not going to do its job, maybe the 
President really doesn’t care about 
these unemployment benefits. 
Think about the anxiety a family 
faces, the uncertainty of: Is my unem-
ployment going to be there? Am I 
going to be able to stay in my apart-
ment? What am I going to do? How am 
I going to feed my kids? What is going 
to happen with schools? We don’t know 
if they are going to be protected, if my 
kids are going to be safe at school. 
Essentially, 
the 
Trump-McConnell 
plan tells people: You are on your own. 
It is time that we, as a body—it is 
time that the Republicans work with 
Speaker PELOSI, work with us, that the 
President pays attention for a moment, 
and we actually take care of people in 
their homes; we take care of workers; 
we take care of people in our schools— 
instead of turning our backs. 
It is time to help families stay in 
their homes. It is time to get people 
the help they need through this pan-
demic. It is time that this body lead 
when the President has failed. 
Their plans don’t come close to being 
enough. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, when 
people talk about this body being fun-
damentally broken under Republican 
leadership, this is exhibit A. This is ex-
hibit A. 
This body has had 2 months to con-
sider legislation that would stand up a 
national effort to squash this pandemic 
once and for all and to make sure that 
people don’t die, don’t go hungry, don’t 
get pushed out into the street at a mo-
ment when unemployment is higher 
than at any time in this country’s his-
tory since the Great Depression. 
We didn’t consider any legislation for 
all of the last work period. We went on 
recess for 2 weeks. Now we are 3 days 
before unemployment benefits expire— 
the additional unemployment bene-
fits—and we are now getting the intro-
duction of what appears to be a dozen 
different pieces of legislation from Sen-
ate Republicans tonight. 
We still don’t have the details, but it 
looks as though there is not one bill 
being introduced but that there are 
about 13 bills being introduced. We 
don’t have enough time before the expi-
ration of unemployment benefits to ne-
gotiate 1 bill—1 bill—never mind 7 or 
10. 
We wasted months of time when 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
should 
have been talking together. Instead, 
Senate 
Republicans 
were 
talking 
amongst themselves and have now 
waited until the zero hour to come out 
with a piece of legislation which calls 
for a $400-per-week cut in unemploy-
ment benefits for people who are out of 
work. 
That is the economic stimulus plan: 
a $400-per-week cut for families in this 
country who have been relying on un-
employment benefits because the econ-
omy is not coming back. 
But I come to this floor tonight to 
tell you why the economy is not com-
ing back. It is not because we haven’t 
appropriated enough money. It is be-
cause we are losing the fight against 
the virus. In 15 days, this country has 
gone from 3 million cases to 4 million 
cases, and there is not enough funding 
in these proposals that were just out-
lined in order to help States beat the 
virus. 
We are, once again, experiencing a 
PPE shortage in this Nation. Doctors 
at Memorial City Medical Center in 
Houston are using single-use N95 res-
pirator masks for 15 days before throw-
ing them out. 
Schools are, right now, planning to 
spend $25 billion in order to buy masks 
and cleaning supplies that are esca-
lating in cost. 
There is nowhere close to enough 
money in this legislation to help 
schools get ready. There is nothing in 
this 
bill 
that 
requires 
the 
operationalization of the Defense Pro-
duction Act to make sure that we are 
producing enough PPE in this country. 
There are still States in this Nation 
that are refusing to open up the health 
insurance systems so more people can 
get access to health insurance. There is 
nothing in these proposals to require 
open enrollment periods in States, to 
make sure that everyone who is con-
tracting this virus has the chance to 
get health insurance. 
The reality is that the States are the 
ones on the frontlines, standing up 
these responses. My State has done 
pretty well, but we are going bankrupt 
in the process. From what I can tell, 
listening to these speeches tonight, 
there is nothing significant in this 
package of bills to help States like 
mine stand up responses. 
So I grieve for families who are going 
to listen to the news tonight and hear 
that Senate Republicans’ stimulus plan 
is to cut their unemployment benefits 
by $400 per week. I also grieve for this 
Nation, knowing that nothing in these 
proposals is significant enough to allow 
States and hospitals and healthcare 
systems to turn around this damaging 
trajectory on the virus, to produce 
enough PPE necessary to do the job, 
and to fix the dangerously broken test-
ing system in this country. 
I plead for my Republican colleagues 
to finally come to the table with 
Democrats in the House and the Senate 
so we can craft something together 
that does the job for families and does 
the job to fix this very, very broken 
healthcare system amidst an advancing 
pandemic.

Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I ask

be immediately notified of the Senate’s

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, today 
marks the third day after a pretty 
emotional weekend for the folks of 
Alabama, for the folks of America. 
Earlier this afternoon, we had a cere-
mony in the Capitol Rotunda to pay 
our respects to the late John Robert 
Lewis, a true American hero. 
A native of Alabama, John grew up 
in the cotton fields of Pike County, 
AL, in Troy, to become one of the most 
influential Members of Congress and, 
perhaps, one of the most influential 
Americans this country has ever seen. 
He was a remarkable human being 
whose life and work are examples to us 
all. It is now up to us to carry on, to 
make ‘‘good trouble,’’ to fulfill the 
dream, the promise of a more equal and 
just nation. 
As a son of Troy, AL, John Lewis 
loved our country with all his heart, 
and he set out to make it a stronger, 
more democratic, more equal, more 
just nation for every person. 
To persevere toward that end in the 
face of the hate and violence he so 
often faced is a testament to the 
strength of both the character and the 
heart of John Lewis. 
John was a dear friend to my wife 
Louise and me, and we are both pro-
foundly grateful to have had him in our 
lives. 
John’s long life represented an un-
broken thread from a very painful past 
to a more hopeful future. He gave us all 
reason to hope. More importantly, he 
gave us the courage to pursue the 
bright future we all want for ourselves 
and for our children and for our grand-
children. 
You know, it struck me earlier 
today, as we had one of the most emo-
tional things that I have been a part of 
with John in the Capitol Rotunda: I 
was 
in 
Selma, 
AL, 
on 
Saturday 
evening—my last trip with John; I 
have had many—at Brown AME Chap-
el, historic Brown Chapel, for a service. 
Martin Luther King III was there. Con-
gresswoman TERRI SEWELL, a daughter 
of Selma, was there. So many of the 
foot soldiers who marched with John 
were there. I was struck by his passion, 
by his courage, and I thought to my-
self: What can I say that has not al-
ready been said about John Lewis? The 
words just escaped me. 
The following day, we were in Mont-
gomery. John took one last journey 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 
Selma, AL. This time, on the other side 
of that bridge, he was met again by 
State troopers from the State of Ala-
bama, but instead of tear gas and billy 
clubs, he was met with salutes as peo-
ple lined the streets, shouting: We have 
got this John. We will carry on. 
Then he went to Montgomery along 
the same path that they marched in 
1965 to make sure that Americans 
could vote, and vote easily, without 
paying a poll tax, without having to 
count jelly beans or guess at the num-
ber of jelly beans in a jar or take an-
other kind of test. 
John marched, and he walked all the 
way from Selma to Montgomery. In 
Montgomery yesterday afternoon, his 
body was placed in the capital of the 
State of Alabama, Montgomery, which 
was the birthplace of the Confederacy, 
the capital of the Confederacy. He had 
to ride past all of those monuments 
that are along the way—and the 
names. 
But on that sunny afternoon, John 
Lewis was brought into the Capitol Ro-
tunda for the State of Alabama—the 
first African American to lie in state in 
the State of Alabama at the capitol. 
Ironically, the last person to lie in 
state at the Alabama capitol was 
George Wallace. What an interesting 
bookend for John’s life—that unbroken 
thread—from a Governor who declared 
‘‘segregation now, segregation tomor-
row, and segregation forever,’’ who in-
stilled lawlessness, all the way to John 
Lewis, who instilled hope and love. 
John Lewis was 25 years old when he 
led a peaceful march across the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. It 
was in 1965. As he got to the other side 
and was met by Alabama State troop-
ers, he had his skull fractured. He was 
called lawless. They all were. That day 
is now forever known as Bloody Sun-
day. 
You know, change doesn’t wait for us 
to become settled and comfortable, and 
even if we are both of those things, it 
just doesn’t allow us to look the other 
way when justice is on the line. If there 
is one lesson from John Lewis’s exem-
plary life—one from so many—that we 
should heed today, it is that we should 
look to the youngest Americans to 
make good on America’s promise and 
show the rest of us how to fight to 
eradicate injustice. 
When George Floyd took his last 
breath, it was young men and women— 
White, Black, and Brown—who rose up 
and said enough is enough, just like 
1965, following the death of Jimmie Lee 
Jackson, when John Lewis and others 
rose up and said enough is enough; just 
as John did as a 21-year-old Freedom 
Rider, risking his life, traveling by bus 
throughout the South. The ride or 
march—that 
journey 
for 
freedom— 
never ended for him, and it can’t end 
for any of us until we make it right. 
Although John truly believed that 
the moral arc of the universe bends to-
ward justice, he knew that it does not 
bend on its own. John certainly did his 
part to bend that moral arc, but as sig-
nificant as his individual efforts were, 
it was his enlistment of others to join 
him that is going to leave his lasting 
legacy. 
We are all here today in some meas-
ure, in some way, because we joined his 
fight for justice. No matter what side 
of the political aisle you are on, no 
matter where you come from, no mat-
ter what your background, we are all 
here today, in part, because of John 
Lewis, to join a fight for justice. We 
join because it is the right thing to do, 
but also because John showed us the 
way. He showed us the way by his cour-
age, by his determination, and, more 
importantly, by his love. 
John Lewis lived to see the genera-
tion that I believe will lead this Nation 
to our ideals and to fulfill a promise to 
all. Like him, this younger generation 
is protesting peacefully, nonviolently. 
They love this Nation. They love this 
Nation as much as John, and they want 
this Nation to fulfill its obligation of 
equality and justice. 
Some have painted them as lawless 
thugs. They would be wrong. They, too, 
like John, are patriots who want Amer-
ica to move forward to a nation of 
equals—that long dream of a nation of 
equals—and move forward together as 
a nation, together as one. 
In Alabama we saw firsthand the di-
visions that John sought to heal and 
the violence that rose up in opposition 
to his peaceful efforts to make right so 
many wrongs. He loved this country so, 
so much. May his love and his moral

courage ripple from this place in Wash-
ington, DC, the floor of the Senate, the 
floor of the House of Representatives, 
from 
Selma 
and 
Birmingham 
and 
Montgomery, Portland and Seattle, 
Minneapolis, Washington—everywhere. 
Let the love and moral courage rip 
through the hearts of young Ameri-
cans—White, Black, and Brown—to 
reach beyond the current chaos and di-
vision, just as John did, and lead us to 
come together as a community to end 
injustice and inequality. 
It is the young among us in Alabama 
and across this Nation who can heal 
what we have failed to heal in our life-
times, no matter how hard John Lewis 
tried. 
I truly believe that with the events 
of the last few weeks, as John saw the 
thousands of new recruits for his quest 
to bend the moral arc of the universe 
toward justice, he confidently looked 
around and said: All is well. It is time 
for the torch to be passed. It is time for 
me to go. 
But it is not just the young in this 
country. As Members of Congress, we 
also have an obligation to act, to bend 
that moral arc toward justice, just as 
John did his entire life. 
As we begin to grapple with a world 
without him, we must face the chal-
lenges of the moment with the same 
grit and perseverance he embodied. We 
are charged—we in this body are 
charged with continuing the fight for 
justice and equality that in his life’s 
work meant so much. 
John was called ‘‘the conscience of 
Congress.’’ May the conscience of all in 
Congress—all of us, each of us, the Sen-
ate, the House—be awakened by his 
passing to finish John’s efforts to re-
store integrity to the Voting Rights 
Act. 
Later, after the reception today, the 
memorial service, the House of Rep-
resentatives voted unanimously, by 
unanimous consent, to change the 
name of H.R. 4 to the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Act of 2020. 
We can talk about naming roads, and 
we can talk about renaming bridges, 
but if there is one thing that John 
Lewis would ask us to do, it is to pass 
the Voting Rights Act of 2020; restore 
the Voting Rights Act to where it is 
supposed to have been. It is a good bill 
that passed the House of Representa-
tives, but it has languished over here 
in the bowels of an office somewhere. 
As we approach the election in 2020, we 
need to send that message that every 
vote in this country can count. Every 
person who is eligible should be able to 
vote and not only cast the ballot but 
cast it with ease, cast it at a time 
when it is convenient with them, cast 
it by mail in the privacy of their home 
if possible, but cast a ballot to raise 
the level of participation. That is what 
John Lewis stood for. That is what 
John Lewis meant. That is what we 
need to do for John Lewis. 
In the program here, I was so pleased 
that this program reprinted a painting 
of John Lewis that is housed in the Bir-
mingham Civil Rights Institute. Below 
it is a quote from John: ‘‘When you see 
something that is not right, not fair, 
not just, you have to [stand up], speak 
up.’’ Speak out and find a way to ‘‘get 
in good trouble, necessary trouble.’’ 
I have to tell you, folks—I have been 
here for 21⁄2 years now, and there are 
just not enough people who will stand 
up and speak out when they see things 
that they know are unfair and unjust. 
It is our job, our duty. We owe it not 
just to our constituents but to the peo-
ple of America to stand up, to speak 
out, and to get in the way, to make 
good trouble. 
It is time that we do that with regard 
to the Voting Rights Act. It is time 
that we do that with regard to the po-
lice reforms and law enforcement re-
forms that are out there as well that 
we know need to exist. So let’s do it, 
folks. Let’s remember John for who he 
was and know more because he was 
that kind of icon. He was that Amer-
ican hero who will last—his legacy will 
last for generations. 
Let’s remember the charge that John 
gave us in the final passage of his auto-
biography, where he quoted the old Af-
rican proverb ‘‘When you pray, move 
your feet.’’ 
John gave us the charge: 
As a nation, if we care for the Beloved 
Community, we must move our feet, our 
hands, our resources to build and not tear 
down, to reconcile and not to divide, to love 
and not to hate, to heal and not to kill. In 
the final analysis, we are one people, one 
family, one house—the American house, the 
American family. 
We must carry John with us every 
step of the way every day and finish his 
life’s work—patriots for equality and 
an America that lives a reality closer 
to its ideals. 
Rest in peace, our old friend John 
Robert Lewis. We have many bridges to 
cross, but we got this. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to 
pay tribute to my colleague, my friend, 
to our American hero who lies in state 
just now in the Rotunda of this Cap-
itol, Congressman John Lewis of At-
lanta, GA. 
Born in Troy, AL, the arc of his life 
is known to us all. He gave himself 
completely to the fight for the dignity 
of every American and every human 
being. I wanted to take a few minutes 
today, if I could, and just reflect a lit-
tle bit on what made John so special 
and so different. 
There are many in this Chamber in 
the Senate and in the House of Rep-
resentatives who have fought for equal-
ity and justice. There are many who 
have marched or who have sacrificed, 
who have fought or who have led in 
many causes over many years, but 
John was both fierce in his passion for 
equality and humble in his spirit, 
gentle and kind. 
One of the great blessings of my dec-
ade here has been to get to travel with 
a group called the Faith & Politics In-
stitute on an annual congressional 
civil rights pilgrimage. Many Members 
of the House and Senate have done so. 
Through five different trips I got to 
travel with John—to Selma and Bir-
mingham, 
to 
Memphis 
and 
Mont-
gomery, to Charleston and Cape Town, 
to South Carolina and South Africa, to 
Alabama and to Delaware—I most 
treasure the memory of hosting John 
in Delaware in 2015 when he came and 
spoke to a whole school full of eager el-
ementary school kids. He spoke to a 
whole auditorium full of young com-
munity leaders and then held a town-
hall for a discussion about equality and 
equity and civil rights. 
John dedicated his life to fighting for 
others and principally fighting for vot-
ing rights. When John, in his child-
hood, was confronted with the ugly re-
ality of Jim Crow and the legal seg-
regation of apartheid in the United 
States, he couldn’t follow the advice he 
was given by family and friends to 
‘‘stay out of trouble. Don’t get in the 
way.’’ He lived his life by the credo: If 
you see something wrong, act like it. 
He was dedicated to getting ‘‘into good 
trouble,’’ into ‘‘necessary trouble,’’ and 
into doing the hard work of redeeming 
the soul of America. 
Long before America came to believe 
in John Lewis, he believed in the prom-
ise of America. That he today lies in 
state on the catafalque that also held 
the remains of the slain President 
Abraham Lincoln; that he, this week, 
will lie in state in the State capital of 
Alabama; and that he will be honored 
by millions nationwide and worldwide 
is just a reminder that he was on the 
right side of history all along. He was 
arrested more than 40 times in the 
course of his activism for civil rights, 
and he proved that courage, as has 
been often said, is not the absence of 
fear but the triumph over it. 
With many others, I had the blessing 
of being at the Edmund Pettus Bridge 
with John on several reenactments of 
that memorable Bloody Sunday march 
and was with him at Brown Chapel 
AME Church for a service of inspira-
tion, gathering before that reenact-
ment of the march. He stopped halfway 
across the bridge and asked each of us 
to just take a moment and pause at the 
bridge, which has a crest to it. He re-
counted how, as they cleared that 
crest, this line—two by two—of peace-
ful protesters, marchers seeking to go 
from Selma to the State capital to 
make their plea for access to that most 
fundamental of rights in our democ-
racy—the ballot box—he could see that 
line of State troopers, of deputies, and 
a ragtag crowd of those who had gath-
ered to do violence to those protesters 
and marchers. He was not gripped with 
fear. He was determined to go ahead 
even though he said he was certain 
that might be his last day. 
You see, John is someone who under-
stood the redemptive power of suf-
fering, someone whom I described as a 
living saint, someone who was willing

to take onto himself the violence vis-
ited upon millions of others in sus-
taining the brutality and the repres-
sion of racial segregation in our coun-
try. And by taking on and believing in 
and living a philosophy, a theology, an 
activist stance of nonviolence, John 
brought alive the conscience of a na-
tion. 
I will just say that in my own life, 
John was someone who made me be-
lieve in the possibility of forgiveness, 
of redemption, and of healing. If a man 
who had suffered as he did at the hands 
of so many bigots, so many acts of vio-
lence and disrespect, from the lunch 
counter sit-ins, to the freedom riots, to 
that march on Bloody Sunday; if that 
man could be as hopeful, as kind, as 
generous in spirit, and as forgiving as 
he was to all who met him, holding on 
with fierceness to his commitment to 
justice and equality, yet openhearted 
and openhanded to all he met; if that 
man could have walked among us, then 
I am one step closer to believing in the 
possibility of forgiveness for us all. 
I want to express my deepest condo-
lences to his son, John Miles Lewis, 
and his family and to all who knew and 
loved and served with him. It is my 
hope that his legacy will be a blessing, 
a challenge, and an inspiration for 
every American. 
There is now on the floor of this Sen-
ate the Voting Rights Advancement 
Act, renamed for John Lewis. On the 
50th anniversary of the march across 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge, I carried a 
copy of that exact bill of that Con-
gress, named the ‘‘John Lewis Voting 
Rights Restoration Act,’’ and asked a 
number of my colleagues if they would 
join in cosponsoring it. One Republican 
did—a Senator from Alaska—and many 
Democrats. What matters is not the 
party but the purpose. 
I will close by saying that we should 
never give up on John’s pursuit of a 
more fair and equal America.

TRIBUTE TO JACK AND DIANA 
BERGER 
∑ Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I am 
pleased to recognize Jack and Diana 
Berger, who are being inducted into the 
Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. 
Every year since 1992, Wyoming has 
recognized individuals who have made 
substantial 
contributions 
to 
agri-
culture in our great State. I am proud 
to say that Jack and Diana Berger 
more than meet these qualifications 
and are well deserving of this honor. 
Natives of Saratoga, WY, Jack and 
Diana Berger remain committed to 
Wyoming’s agriculture industry and 
the Saratoga community. Jack is cur-
rently serving as president of the Wyo-
ming Natural Resource Foundation, 
which is dedicated to conserving Wyo-
ming’s natural resources, heritage, and 
culture. He has been instrumental in 
providing the necessary support to 
fund a variety of water quality initia-
tives and rangeland and wildlife habi-
tat improvement projects. Jack is also 
the past president of the Carbon Coun-
ty Stock Growers. Diana was elected to 
serve on Carbon County School Dis-
trict No. 2 for two terms. In 2018, she 
was appointed by then-Wyoming Gov-
ernor Matt Mead to serve on the Wyo-
ming State Fair Advisory Board and 
elected to serve as chair in 2019. As a 
member of the Wyoming Stock Grow-
ers Environmental Stewardship Com-
mittee, Diana played an intricate role 
in selecting members of the Wyoming 
agricultural community who exhibit 
outstanding stewardship ethics. These 
are just a few of the organizations Jack 
and Diana have dedicated their time 
to. 
Perhaps 
more 
inspirational 
than 
their achievements, however, is the 
Bergers’ commitment to the Saratoga 
community. Jack and Diana have a 
passion for the agriculture industry 
and their fellow producers, and want to 
see these people succeed right along-
side them. They genuinely enjoy ranch-
ing and making a living off of the land. 
The Bergers also firmly believe, like 
myself, that the most effective policy 
decisions are made at the State and 
local level, especially when concerning 
critical industries like agriculture. 
Like most folks in the great State of 
Wyoming, the Bergers know that hard 
work, proper stewardship of the land, 
and a commitment to your neighbor go 
a long way in ensuring a strong agri-
culture 
industry 
and 
happy 
and 
healthy communities. 
Fortunately 
for 
Wyoming, 
the 
Bergers also truly understand the im-
portance of passing their knowledge on 
to the next generation of Wyomingites. 
They continue to share their passion 
for agriculture with their children 
Jace, Aubrey, Kyle, and Kirby. Jack 
and Diana remain active in the Carbon 
County Fair with 4–H and FFA. It is 
truly inspiring to see Wyomingites who 
understand the importance of passing 
their knowledge on to those who come 
next, so they too can have a positive 
impact on Wyoming’s agriculture in-
dustry like Jack and Diana have.

The Bergers’ values, dedication, and 
work ethic exemplify the Wyoming 
way of life. I want to extend my con-
gratulations to them and thank them 
for their service and years of hard 
work. Jack and Diana Berger truly live 
the Cowboy way of life, and I am proud 
to have the opportunity to recognize 
their achievements as inductees into

TRIBUTE TO BRAD BONER 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, at 
the 108th Wyoming State Fair, Senator 
ENZI and I will have the pleasure of in-
troducing Brad Boner as one of the 2020 
inductees of the Wyoming Agriculture 
Hall of Fame. He is a man of honesty, 
hard work, and strong leadership. I am 
proud to say Mr. Boner exemplifies the 
ideals of the Wyoming way of life 
through his immense contributions to 
Wyoming agriculture. 
Mr. Boner has demonstrated his deep- 
rooted commitment to the Wyoming 
community and, above all, his family. 
He is supported by his wife Laurie and 
three children, Braden, Meghan, and 
Ryan. After graduating from the Uni-
versity of Wyoming with an ag busi-
ness 
degree, 
Brad 
returned 
to 
Glenrock, WY, where he still ranches 
at the M Diamond Angus Ranch along-
side his two brothers, Rob and Jeff, and 
their father, Bob. 
Mr. Boner’s involvement in agri-
culture goes far beyond production. In 
fact, his dedication and passion for the 
industry are evident through his active 
involvement in both cattle and sheep 
industries on local, State, and national 
levels. Brad is the current American 
Sheep Industry Association secretary 
and treasurer, as well as president of 
both the Wyoming Wool Growers and 
Wyoming Angus Association. Brad has 
served in various capacities whenever 
he has been called upon, often sacri-
ficing valuable time on his home 
ranch. Brad serves as the supervisor of 
the Converse County Conservation Dis-
trict, Wyoming Animal Damage Con-
trol Board, and American Sheep Indus-
try ‘‘Let it Grow’’ committee. Brad’s 
dedication to the State and the indus-
try has not gone unnoticed. In 2014, he 
was recognized as a University of Wyo-
ming College of Agriculture ‘‘Out-
standing Alumni.’’ 
In addition to serving in many capac-
ities to the benefit of Wyoming’s sheep 
ranching community, Brad steps up 
and serves as an articulate spokesman 
on moving the sheep industry forward. 
One of the most noteworthy accom-
plishments is Brad’s active role in 
forming the Mountain States Lamb Co-
operative, including serving as MSLC’s 
first chairman and current chairman. 
Mr. Boner is not only a leader in Wy-
oming’s strong agriculture community, 
but a wonderful mentor to the youth 
across our State. He believes sharing 
his love for agriculture with students 
is the best way to ensure the continu-
ation of this great industry for genera-
tions to come. I would agree. I think 
that the greatest accomplishment is 
the mentorship that we can provide to 
the young folks of this country, and 
this is exactly what Mr. Boner con-
tinues to do. Through the Future Cat-
tle Producers of Wyoming program, he 
donates a heifer to a student applicant 
that wants to learn about the industry. 
This program assists students in be-
coming involved in cattle production 
and helps them establish their own 
herds. 
In addition to assisting many stu-
dents on the agriculture front, for 
more than 30 years, Brad has dedicated 
his time to his community by ref-
ereeing basketball games from middle 
school to intermural college games. He 
also helped coach the boys and girls 
traveling teams to support his chil-
dren. As Peter Camino, former presi-
dent of the Wyoming Wool Growers As-
sociation, observed, ‘‘He has worked 
diligently to solidify a future not only 
for himself, but the future of genera-
tions to follow.’’ 
Brad’s humble character and dedica-
tion to agriculture have truly made an 
impact and helped grow our agriculture 
community. I think I speak for many 
when I say I am truly grateful for his 
leadership, contributions, and caring 
demeanor 
that 
has 
so 
graciously 
blessed our State in many ways. 
With Brad Boner’s constant diligence 
to improve and impact his community, 
it is with my great honor to induct him 
into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of 
Fame. He represents every positive at-
tribute of a leader in Wyoming agri-
culture and the Code of the West. He 
has represented Wyoming’s interests 
with dedication and honor. It is be-
cause of people like him that the agri-
cultural community in Wyoming has a 
bright and productive future. My wife 
Bobbi joins me in congratulating the 
outstanding individual, Brad Boner, 
who is a 2020 inductee into the Wyo-
ming Agriculture Hall of Fame.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DR. NATE SMITH 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Nate Smith, 
whose expert medical guidance and 
strong leadership will be deeply missed 
following his departure from the Ar-
kansas Department of Health. 
Dr. Smith launched his career with 
the Arkansas Department of Health in 
2009. His extensive medical background 
and dedication to the department’s 
mission allowed him quick advance-
ment through the agency ranks. He ini-
tially served as State epidemiologist 
and subsequently served as branch 
chief for infectious diseases and deputy 
director for Public Health Programs. 
However, Dr. Smith’s more recent and 
notable appointments to director and 
State health officer in 2013 and sec-
retary of health in 2019 presented him 
with even greater responsibility in 
maintaining 
and 
protecting 
public 
health in the State of Arkansas. As a 
member of Governor Asa Hutchinson’s 
cabinet, Dr. Smith crafted and imple-
mented the State’s response to the 
COVID–19 emergency. He has worked 
diligently alongside the Governor’s 
team to provide medical and scientific 
reasoning for pandemic-related deci-
sions. Dr. Smith’s commitment to the 
health and well-being of Arkansans has 
always been evident. We are especially 
grateful for that commitment as he 
navigated unprecedented times on be-
half of our State. 
Dr. Smith’s distinguished career with 
the Arkansas Department of Health 
comes after years of education and 
preparation, including over a decade of 
comprehensive medical schooling, four 
degrees, and two board certifications. 
After graduating from Rice University 
in 1986, Dr. Smith claimed home to 
Texas and its classrooms for the next 
10 years. By 1991, Dr. Smith had earned 
two more degrees: a doctor of medicine 
from Baylor College of Medicine and a 
master of arts from Dallas Theological 
Seminary. In 1996, Dr. Smith earned a 
master of public health from the Uni-
versity of Texas School of Public 
Health, focusing on disease control. He 
completed two infectious disease fel-
lowships at Baylor College of Medicine 
before pursuing a degree in tropical 
medicine and hygiene from the Liver-
pool School of Tropical Medicine and 
Hygiene in England. 
What emerged as an area of interest 
for Dr. Smith in medical school led to 
an expansive, acclaimed career in in-
fectious disease medicine. After years 
of education and training, Dr. Smith 
took his knowledge to Africa at the 
height of the AIDS epidemic. While si-
multaneously serving as a medical mis-
sionary with his wife, Dr. Smith 
worked at Kijabe Hospital in Kenya in 
the roles as chief of internal medicine, 
medical intern program director, and 
infectious disease consultant. He found 
himself back in Kenya in 2006 under the 
direction of the University of Maryland 
School of Medicine, this time working 
with the Kenya Institute of Human Vi-
rology as a senior medical technical 
adviser and country medical director. 
His expertise in infectious disease is 
well-respected and has led to his par-
ticipation and leadership in several 
medical advisory groups. Dr. Smith 
served as chairman of the infection 
control committee for the Arkansas 
Department of Health, chairman of the 
Arkansas AIDS Drug Assistance Pro-
gram Formulary Advisory Committee, 
and chairman of the Infectious Disease 
Policy Committee for the Association 
of State and Territorial Health Offi-
cials, ASTHO. He sat on the National 
Vaccine Advisory Committee for the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services for several years before an ap-
pointment to the CDC Advisory Com-
mittee on Immunization Practices. 
Further, Dr. Smith has published more

than 25 scientific papers with the ma-
jority citing infectious disease studies. 
It is clear that Dr. Smith’s passion 
for service and selfless dedication to 
public health has brought tremendous 
value to Arkansas, its institutions, 
and, most importantly, its 3 million 
citizens. The University of Arkansas 
for Medical Sciences is one such insti-
tution that will undoubtedly feel Dr. 
Smith’s absence, as he has held several 
academic appointments alongside his 
career at the Arkansas Department of 
Health. What began as a voluntary po-
sition in 2009 became a mainstay en-
deavor for Dr. Smith. He has since held 
several professorships at the university 
in the division of infectious diseases 
and 
the 
epidemiology 
department. 
When Dr. Smith is not teaching, work-
ing or spending time with his family of 
five, he can be found donating his time 
and service to St. Andrew’s Anglican 
Church in Little Rock, where he works 
with the leadership team and missions 
team. His robust professional and com-
munity impact have earned him the 
following awards: the Arkansas AIDS 
Foundation’s Compassion Award, the 
Arkansas Public Health Association’s 
Director’s Award for Science, and the 
Living and Affected Corporation’s Dis-
tinguished Service Award. 
I want to graciously thank Dr. Smith 
for his tireless commitment to improv-
ing the health and wellness of Arkan-
sans. I appreciate his friendship and ex-
ample for us all as a true public serv-
ant. His transition to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention is bit-
tersweet, and we are full of gratitude 
and pride for Dr. Smith and his dedica-
tion to our State over the past two dec-
ades.∑

TRIBUTE TO MARGARET DAGMAN 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I want 
to honor a very special North Dakota 
resident who turned 100 years old on 
July 17. Margaret Michalski Dagman 
has been a lifelong resident of the 
Nome and Enderlin, ND, area. She and 
her late husband, Vernon, raised two 
children and farmed for many years 
near Enderlin. They were active in 
their community, and Margaret sup-
ported Vernon during his years rep-
resenting Ransom County in the North 
Dakota Legislature in the early 1960s. 
Throughout the decades of her life 
across the past century, Margaret has 
experienced great moments in North 
Dakota’s 
history. 
She 
shared 
her 
memories 
of 
attending 
the 
Nome 
Schoolhouse in a recent video produced 
about the restored building. She re-
called bringing lunch to school in 
syrup pails, the many poems she and 
her classmates were required to memo-
rize, and some of her favorite teachers. 
Although a large celebration did not 
happen on Margaret’s birthday, the 
community of Enderlin drove by her 
home and honked with birthday wish-
es. I hope she will be able to celebrate 
this great milestone with friends and 
family at other opportunities through-
out the year. 
North Dakota is home to more than 
200 centenarians, and we consider them 
among our most treasured residents. 
Their pioneer spirit, dignity, and hard 
work have brought them through many 
challenges and personal achievements. 
On behalf of all North Dakotans, I wish 
Margaret a happy 100th birthday and 
hope this is the start of a year filled 
with happiness and joy.∑

TRIBUTE TO JOHN ‘‘MIKE’’ 
CROTEAU 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I 
would like to congratulate Mr. John 
‘‘Mike’’ Croteau of Newbury, NH, on 
his retirement from the Newbury Fire 
Department after a remarkable 75 
years of service. 
Mike’s father, George, was a long- 
time member and chief of the Newbury 
Fire Department, and in 1945, 15-year- 
old Mike, joined the department too. 
At first, Mike helped put out brush 
fires caused by trains that ran from 
Boston to Newbury Station. When 
Mike was 18, he fought the fire on 
Mount Sunapee that claimed 1,700 
acres. Hundreds of firefighters worked 
for 7 days straight to battle the fast- 
moving fire during one of the worst fire 
seasons ever recorded in New Hamp-
shire history. 
Beyond his work at the fire depart-
ment, Mike was an engineer for the 
New Hampshire Department of Trans-
portation for 33 years, and the Town of 
Newbury often called upon his exper-
tise for site work and design. While 
working for the State, he continued to 
serve the fire department, serving as 
the fire chief, as well as forest fire war-
den. 
Mike has dedicated many hours of his 
time to the Newbury Fire Department 
in addition to firefighting by helping 
with fundraising efforts, including the 
annual bingo nights and auctions. His 
dedication to his community also went 
beyond his exemplary fire department 
service; he also volunteered for many 
town groups, boards, and activities and 
has always stepped up when something 
needs to be done. 
In 2012, Governor John Lynch com-
mended Mike for 67 years of service as 
a firefighter, and in 2015, he received 
the Fire Service Lifetime Achievement 
Award from the New Hampshire Police, 
Fire, and EMS Foundation. 
Mike’s commitment to his commu-
nity and the Newbury Fire Department 
is a shining example of the spirit of 
New Hampshire, and he serves as a role 
model for all Granite Staters. He has 
been a critical part of the department 
for 75 years, and he has put himself at 
risk day after day to protect his fellow 
citizens. His town, State, and country 
are better because of his dedicated ef-
forts. 
I hope you will join me in honoring 
an exemplary Granite Stater, Mike 
Croteau.∑ 
TRIBUTE TO CARTER MANSON 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to honor Carter Manson of Man-
chester as July’s Granite Stater of the 
Month. Carter’s efforts to encourage 
Granite Staters and all Americans to 
get outside and help clean up their 
communities has made a true dif-
ference in a difficult time. 
Carter, who is only 5 years old, has 
wanted to be a garbage man since he 
was 3. For Halloween last year, he even 
dressed up as a trash collector to show 
his appreciation for his heroes. Now, 
due in part to the COVID–19 pandemic, 
Carter has taken his passion for gar-
bage collection one step further. 
One day in April while the stay-at- 
home orders for New Hampshire were 
in place, Carter asked his mom, Kelly, 
if he could go outside and pick up some 
trash. Kelly obliged and took some 
photos of her young son cleaning up his 
neighborhood and posted them on her 
Facebook page. 
Much to her surprise, the photos 
Kelly posted of Carter’s efforts re-
ceived a lot of attention from her 
friends and family. In response, she de-
cided to build on the momentum Carter 
had inspired by creating a group called 
Carter’s Clean Up Crew. 
The ‘‘Crew’’ now has nearly 800 mem-
bers from across the United States and 
Canada. The group has also received 
support from 22 businesses and raised 
$1,400 to help get members of the group 
the supplies that they need to clean up 
their communities, including trash 
grabbers and gloves. 
The Crew is planning their first big 
cleanup day at the end of August, and 
Carter and Kelly have been rallying 
members of their community to join 
them in Manchester for the big day. 
In the meantime, Carter has been 
diligent in his clean up regimen and 
goes out with his mom at least once a 
week to pick up 5 gallons of trash in 
neighborhoods across Manchester. 
Carter’s passion for cleaning up his 
environment and encouraging others to 
do the same represents the best of our 
State and our all-hands-on-deck spirit. 
It also represents how eager people are 
to strengthen and improve their com-
munities even during this pandemic. I 
applaud Carter for his efforts and look 
forward to seeing what he accomplishes 
next.∑

TRIBUTE TO JAMES ‘‘RUSTY’’ 
MITCHELL 
∑ Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I rise 
today to congratulate Lt. Col. (Ret.) 
James ‘‘Rusty’’ Mitchell on his retire-
ment from the Community Initiatives 
Team—CIT—at Luke Air Force Base in 
my home State of Arizona. 
Rusty first joined the Air Force in 
1976 and spent years serving his coun-
try around the globe. Rusty also spent 
a significant amount of his Air Force 
career at Arizona military installa-
tions, serving as an A–10 jet instructor 
at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and

having several different roles at Luke 
Air Force Base involving the F–16 
fighter jet. He retired from the Air 
Force in 1998 after 22 years of service to 
his country. 
Rusty still had a desire to fly, so 
after his retirement from the Air 
Force, he became a captain for United 
Airlines, a career that he enjoyed and 
continued for 21 years before retiring 
from that role last year. 
But despite becoming a pilot for 
United, it became clear that Rusty 
wasn’t ready to end his service to the 
Air Force. In 2003, Rusty became the 
director of the Community Initiatives 
Team at Luke Air Force Base. In this 
role he served as a liaison between the 
U.S. Air Force, Luke Air Force Base, 
the State of Arizona and 11 of the local 
cities and municipalities surrounding 
the base. He played a vital role in help-
ing Luke Air Force Base secure the F– 
35 training mission, bring critical jobs 
to the State and boosting the local 
economy. Furthermore, Rusty has been 
personally helpful to me and my staff 
in our official visits to Luke Air Force 
Base, numerous inquiries and countless 
requests for information. 
Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Mitchell 
has served this country, the Air Force, 
and Luke Air Force Base as an airman 
and civilian for almost 40 years, and he 
will be missed. On behalf of the U.S. 
Congress and the State of Arizona, I 
want to thank Rusty for his service 
and congratulate him on a well-de-
served retirement.∑

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. ROMNEY (for himself, 
Mr. MANCHIN, Mr. YOUNG, Ms. 
SINEMA, 
Mrs. 
CAPITO, 
Mr. 
JONES, 
Mr. 
ALEXANDER, 
Mr. 
KING, Mr. PORTMAN, Mr. WAR-
NER, Mr. PERDUE, Mr. CORNYN, 
Ms. MCSALLY, Mr. ROUNDS, and 
Mr. SULLIVAN): 
S. 4323. A bill to save and strengthen 
critical social contract programs of the 
Federal Government; to the Committee 
on Finance. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to propose the TRUST Act of 
2020. This is bipartisan legislation. It is 
sponsored by 14 other Senators, both 
Democrats and Republicans, and sup-
ported by 30 Members from each party 
from the House. 
Its purpose is to preserve the Social 
Security and Medicare trust funds, 
among others, both of which have been 
pushed closer to bankruptcy due to the 
pandemic. The Committee for a Re-
sponsible Federal Budget projects that 
Medicare Part A will now become in-
solvent in only 4 years, and the Social 
Security retirement trust fund by 2031. 
Under the law, insolvency would trig-
ger drastic benefit cuts, or, if approved 
by a future Congress, draconian tax 
hikes. Our TRUST Act is designed to 
save these trust funds in addition to 
other vital Federal trust funds. 
The TRUST Act also addresses our 
ballooning national debt, a burden 
which has become even greater due to 
the COVID–19 crisis. The CBO projects 
that the Federal budget deficit will be 
$3.7 trillion this year. Our national 
debt will exceed $27 trillion. That could 
eventually mean backbreaking interest 
payments, runaway inflation, or na-
tional financial calamity. 
Modeled loosely after the Simpson- 
Bowles fiscal commission, the TRUST 
Act would create a process to rescue 
these funds. Under the bill, an indi-
vidual rescue committee would be cre-
ated for each of the trust funds. Each 
committee would be tasked with draft-
ing bipartisan legislation that would 
provide for its solvency. 
Members of the rescue committees 
would come equally from the House 
and the Senate and equally from each 
party. If the majority of a committee 
supported a solvency plan and if at 
least two members from each party en-
dorsed that plan, it would be brought, 
on an expedited basis, to the floor. 
The TRUST Act has strong bipar-
tisan consensus among Senators and 
Members of the House, as well as policy 
advocates across the political spec-
trum, from Freedom Works to the 
Brookings Institution, as well as from 
Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles. 
This is the right time to act. Our 
trust funds are approaching insolvency 
even more rapidly due to the pandemic. 
More importantly, if we don’t act now, 
it will never happen before we face an 
overwhelming crisis. One of the lessons 
the COVID–19 crisis has taught us is 
that it is far better to prepare and 
hopefully prevent a crisis than to wait 
for a crisis to fall upon us. 
The TRUST Act is the only bipar-
tisan, bicameral solution that has been 
proposed to save our trust funds and to 
restore fiscal stability. I urge this body 
to work in good faith to advance this 
proposal as part of additional pandemic 
relief.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
658—CALL-
ING FOR A FREE, FAIR, AND 
TRANSPARENT 
PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION IN BELARUS TAKING 
PLACE ON AUGUST 9, 2020, IN-
CLUDING THE UNIMPEDED PAR-
TICIPATION 
OF 
ALL 
PRESI-
DENTIAL CANDIDATES 
Mr. 
DURBIN 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
CARDIN, Mr. RUBIO, and Mrs. SHAHEEN) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 658 
Whereas long-term president Alyaksandr 
Lukashenko has ruled Belarus as an undemo-
cratic dictatorship since the first presi-
dential election in Belarus in 1994 and is run-
ning for a sixth term in office; 
Whereas 
the 
presidential 
elections 
in 
Belarus have been neither free nor fair and 
have been rejected by the international com-
munity as not meeting minimal electoral 
standards; 
Whereas Belarus abolished presidential 
term limits in a referendum in 2004, and 
Lukashenko affirmed in November 2019 that 
he plans to run again in 2025; 
Whereas, in the most recent 2010 and 2015 
presidential 
elections, 
Lukashenko 
arbi-
trarily disqualified or jailed key opponents 
ahead of and after the elections; 
Whereas, in March 2011, the United States 
Senate unanimously passed a resolution con-
demning the Belarusian elections as illegit-
imate and calling on the Belarusian regime 
to immediately release all political pris-
oners; 
Whereas, according to the Department of 
State 2019 Country Report on Human Rights 
Practices for Belarus, Lukashenko has con-
solidated his rule over all institutions since 
his first term as president and undermined 
the rule of law through authoritarian means, 
including manipulated elections and arbi-
trary decrees, such that all subsequent presi-
dential elections fell well short of inter-
national standards; 
Whereas the law of Belarus provides citi-
zens the ability to choose their government 
in free and fair periodic elections held by se-
cret ballot and based on universal and equal 
suffrage, but the Government of Belarus has 
consistently denied citizens that ability; 
Whereas flawed referendums in 1996 and 
2004 amended the Constitution of Belarus to 
broaden the powers of Lukashenko, extend 
his term in office, and remove presidential 
term limits; 
Whereas appearances by opposition politi-
cians on state media have historically been 
limited and such restrictions have been 
strongly criticized by the Office for Demo-
cratic Institutions and Human Rights of the 
Organization for Security and Co-operation 
in Europe (OSCE/ODIHR), which has not rec-
ognized any elections in Belarus as free and 
fair since 1995; 
Whereas authorities in Belarus routinely 
impede the activities and legal status of op-
position political parties by refusing to reg-
ister them, while allowing approximately 6 
largely inactive but officially registered pro- 
Lukashenko political parties to operate free-
ly; 
Whereas the Central Election Commission 
of Belarus (CVK) disqualified the majority of 
potential candidates from the upcoming Au-
gust 9, 2020, presidential election for politi-
cally motivated purposes; 
Whereas, on June 30, 2020, the Central Elec-
tion Commission barred Valery Tsepkalo, a

former Ambassador to the United States and 
First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
one of the major challengers to Lukashenko, 
from running in the presidential election; 
Whereas, on May 6, 2020, popular blogger 
Syarhey Tsikhanouski was arrested and 
jailed for 15 days prior to a rally he had 
planned for May 9, 2020, to challenge the de-
cision by Lukashenko to hold a Victory Day 
military parade despite the coronavirus pan-
demic; 
Whereas, between May 6 and June 16, 2020, 
courts in Belarus convicted 97 individuals as 
part of a new wave of political persecution 
for ‘‘illegal protesting’’ and sentenced those 
individuals to various terms of detention for 
a total of 1,246 days, while 105 individuals 
were fined a total of 90,000 rubles, approxi-
mately 40,000 United States dollars; 
Whereas, on May 15, 2020, the Central Elec-
tion Commission rejected the registration 
documents submitted by Tsikhanouski for 
his candidacy for the presidential election; 
Whereas, on May 19, 2020, the Central Elec-
tion Commission rejected the candidacy of 
opposition politician Mikalay Statkevich, 
who previously challenged Lukashenko in 
2010 and was incarcerated for 4 years and 8 
months for protesting the disputed election, 
allegedly on the basis of his ‘‘criminal 
record’’; 
Whereas Statkevich was subsequently sen-
tenced on June 1, 2020, to 15 days in jail for 
taking part in an ‘‘unauthorized’’ opposition 
event in Minsk to collect signatures for his 
candidacy, was sentenced to another 15 days 
on June 15, 2020, and still remains incarcer-
ated as of July 27, 2020; 
Whereas, on May 22, 2020, Human Rights 
Watch reported that between May 6 and 13, 
2020, authorities in Belarus ‘‘arbitrarily ar-
rested over 120 peaceful protesters, opposi-
tion bloggers, journalists, and other critics 
of the government in 17 cities,’’ including 
Youth Block movement activists concerned 
about human rights and rule of law in 
Belarus, which ‘‘is particularly disturbing in 
light of the COVID–19 pandemic’’; 
Whereas, on May 29, 2020, Tsikhanouski 
was arrested again in Hrodna while col-
lecting signatures for the presidential can-
didacy 
of 
his 
spouse, 
Svyatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya, who is running in his 
stead, and Tsikhanouski was subsequently 
charged with ‘‘the organization and prepara-
tion of actions that severely violated public 
order’’; 
Whereas, on May 31, 2020, Belarusian 
human rights group Viasna (Spring) reported 
that 50 opposition activists were arrested by 
police while they were gathering signatures 
to allow opponents to participate in the pres-
idential election; 
Whereas, 
on 
June 
8, 
2020, 
Paval 
Sevyarynets, co-chairman of the opposition 
Belarusian Christian Democratic Party, was 
sentenced to 15 days in jail for supporting 
independent presidential candidates in ral-
lies in Minsk on June 7, 2020, and subse-
quently, on July 8, 2020, was sentenced to a 
fifth consecutive 15-day jail term; 
Whereas, on June 18, 2020, authorities ar-
rested 
potential 
presidential 
challenger 
Viktar Babaryka and his son, Eduard, who 
heads his presidential campaign; 
Whereas, on June 19, 2020, the European 
Union issued a statement calling on the Gov-
ernment of Belarus to immediately release 
Babaryka and his son and called for an im-
partial investigation into the arrests; 
Whereas, according to the Belarusian Asso-
ciation of Journalists, on June 19, 2020, po-
lice officers detained at least 14 journalists, 
including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty 
(RFE/RL) reporter Alyaksandra Dynko and 
cameraperson Andrey Rabchyk, who were 
covering protests against the efforts of 
Lukashenko to undermine the electoral 
process; 
Whereas, on June 19, 2020, the United 
States Embassy in Minsk urged the Govern-
ment of Belarus to ‘‘uphold its international 
commitments to respect fundamental free-
doms’’; 
Whereas, according to the Committee to 
Protect Journalists, over 3 days starting on 
June 25, 2020, authorities arrested several 
bloggers, 
including 
Ihor 
Losik, 
Serhei 
Petrukhin, Aleksandr Kabanau, Volodimir 
Neronski, Aleksandr Andreyev, Volodimir 
Tsiganovich, and Serhei Sparish, a move 
Amnesty International said represents ‘‘a 
full-scale purge of dissenting voices’’; 
Whereas, on June 24, 2020, Representative 
Alcee L. Hastings, Chairman of the Commis-
sion on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(commonly known as the ‘‘Helsinki Commis-
sion’’), released a statement noting that 
Belarusian authorities have made it impos-
sible to hold free and fair elections by ‘‘ar-
resting and intimidating presidential can-
didates, journalists, and activists in the 
early stages of campaigning,’’ and moreover, 
that ‘‘[t]here can be no free choice when the 
system is rigged in favor of the incumbent,’’ 
and called upon Lukashenko to ‘‘order the 
release of those who have been detained for 
political reasons and allow real political 
competition in Belarus’’; 
Whereas, on June 29, 2020, Amnesty Inter-
national issued a statement condemning 
that ‘‘[t]here is no safe environment for po-
litical debate in Belarus, and there is a grow-
ing crackdown on human rights in the con-
text of the forthcoming election,’’ and more-
over, ‘‘[o]pposition candidates along with 
their supporters are smeared, targeted and 
incarcerated under trumped-up charges, with 
women particularly targeted’’; 
Whereas, on July 3, 2020, in a statement 
commemorating the Independence Day of 
Belarus, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 
urged the ‘‘government of Belarus to do ev-
erything in its power to ensure the upcoming 
elections are free and fair,’’ including ‘‘the 
right of a diverse range of candidates to par-
ticipate in the campaign, the right of citi-
zens to assemble peacefully and speak freely, 
and open and fair ballot counting’’; 
Whereas, on July 14, 2020, the Central Elec-
tion Commission ultimately approved only 5 
candidates to run in the presidential elec-
tion, 
namely, 
Lukashenko, 
Andrey 
Dzmitryyeu, Hanna Kanapatskaya, Syarhey 
Cherachan, and Tsikhanouskaya; 
Whereas, on July 14, 2020, during protests 
over the unjustified disqualification of sev-
eral presidential candidates, authorities used 
unnecessary and excessive force to detain at 
least 220 individuals across the country; 
Whereas, on July 14, 2020, authorities de-
tained at least 17 journalists covering pro-
tests in Minsk, Brest, and Homel, including 
Katsiaryna Andreeva (and Ihar Ilyash when 
he sought her release) with Poland-reg-
istered 
broadcaster 
Belsat 
TV, 
Danil 
Palyanski with independent news website

blogger 
Anatoly Chilik, Andy Smythe with BBC, Mi-
khail Ilyin and Artsiom Mayorau with Pol-
ish broadcaster Euroradio, and Ales Piletski 
and Andrey Rabchyk with RFE/RL; 
Whereas, on July 15, 2020, at least 2,000 peo-
ple lined up to file complaints with the Cen-
tral Election Commission for denying the 
candidacy registrations of Babaryka and 
Tsapkalo, and authorities detained another 
16 people, including RFE/RL correspondent 
Anton 
Trofimovich 
and 
BelaPAN 
cor-
respondent Violeta Savchyts; 
Whereas, on July 15, 2020, Amnesty Inter-
national issued a statement in response to 
the arrest of protesters in Minsk on July 14, 
2020, stating that ‘‘[a]nyone detained simply 
for peacefully protesting in Minsk, or other 
cities, is a prisoner of conscience, and must 
be immediately and unconditionally re-
leased’’; and 
Whereas, on July 22, 2020, the Central Elec-
tion Commission announced it will severely 
limit the number of observers during early 
voting and on election day: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the politically motived arrest 
and imprisonment of opposition candidates 
in Belarus, including Syarhey Tsikhanouski, 
Viktar Babaryka, and Mikalay Statkevich, 
and calls for their immediate release and 
ability to compete in the August 9, 2020,

by the Central Election Commission of 
Belarus of the majority of the potential can-
didates for the August 9, 2020, presidential

inclusive presidential elections on August 9, 
2020, that meet international standards and

the electric power grid, satellites and sat-
ellite 
communications 
and 
information, 
aviation operations, astronauts living and 
working in space, and space-based position, 
navigation, and timing systems could have 
significant societal, economic, national secu-

vations provide crucial data necessary to un-
derstand, forecast, and prepare for space 
weather phenomena. 
‘‘(D) Clear roles and accountability of Fed-
eral departments and agencies are critical 
for efficient and effective response to threats 
posed by space weather.

REMEMBERING STEPHEN D. 
SUSMAN 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, on the 
day that we are remembering our dear 
friend 
and 
colleague 
John 
Lewis, 
‘‘someone who got in good trouble, 
someone who got in the way,’’ I rise to 
join with my colleague from the State 
of Rhode Island to offer tribute to a 
dear friend who also knew how to get 
in good trouble and get in the way. 
Our friend Steve Susman of Houston, 
TX, at age 79, passed away on July 14 
after sustaining serious injuries from a 
cycling accident and suffering from 
COVID–19. Steve will be remembered 
by all he inspired as one of the greatest 
trial attorneys ever in the United 
States. Steve is someone who, with in-
credible skill, prepared painstakingly, 
mastering the facts, so that he could 
back up every single thing he said in 
front of a jury. 
When it came to courtrooms, it is 
said that Steve was the smartest guy 
in the room, but he also believed deep-
ly in teaching young lawyers trial 
skills. And unlike many famous and 
leading trial attorneys, he was happy 
to share the spotlight with younger 
lawyers—in fact, insisted on it. Two of 
those younger lawyers happen to be 
friends of mine from law school, Jona-
than Ross and Andrew Golub, who first 
introduced me to Steve and gave me 
the joy of getting to know him and all 
who practiced with him. 
Steve was passionate about law and 
justice. He spent his entire life think-
ing and talking about and working for 
ways to improve the system of civil 
justice in America. Motivated by a 
deep passion for the law, he fought to 
improve our system and was a cru-
sader. Respected broadly for his leader-
ship and his ability to achieve justice 
for his clients, Steve is someone who 
left a lasting impact on his community 
and our country. 
His incredible generosity to Yale 
University, to the University of Texas 
Law School, to the NYU Law School 
Civil Jury Project, and to the Anti-Def-
amation League, among many others, 
will be remembered for years and years 
to come. Steve had boundless energy, 
deep affection for his family, and a pas-
sionate commitment to the law. 
This is a difficult time for his family, 
his friends, his colleagues, and his 
loved ones. I want to give my special 
condolences to his wife, Ellen; his chil-
dren, 
Harry, 
Stacy, 
Whitney, 
and 
Amanda; his brother, Tommy; and his 
eight grandchildren. I share with them 
my deepest and sincere condolences in 
the passing of this lion of the law. We 
will not see his like again. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Rhode Island. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to join my colleague from 
Delaware here to offer a Senate floor 
farewell to our friend Steve Susman. 
He was a very big personality, but un-
like a lot of very big personalities, it 
was never all about him. He wasn’t 
pushing people away with the size of 
his personality. He was enveloping 
them with the size of his personality, 
and I was one who was fortunate to be 
so enveloped. We became friends, and I 
will miss him. 
To Ellen and to their children, to his 
brother, Tom, who gave such beautiful 
remarks at the electronic service for 
Steve the other day, I want to say 
thank you. 
I just want to tell one story, but the 
story will not make sense if you don’t 
understand what a big deal Steve Sus-
man was. If you don’t understand that 
he was the main partner of Susman 
Godfrey, which by many lights is the 
best and biggest litigation firm in the 
United States of America. His name is 
on that firm. His name is on thousands 
of pleadings filed by that firm in cases 
all around the country. He is a person

who had gravitas as a lawyer and who 
lived before judges and needed to make 
sure he kept their good will and re-
spect. 
Now, for a lot of people, that would 
have meant taking no chances—not for 
Steve. I have a practice, from time to 
time, in the Senate, of writing Su-
preme Court amicus briefs as an ami-
cus curiae—a friend of the court and 
not the party. The Court rules allow 
me both to express their views on the 
law and on the background facts in 
cases—those people are called friends 
of the court—and I have filed those 
briefs over and over again. They are 
not the usual friend-of-the-court brief. 
Let’s just say that. 
I believe that as a U.S. Senator, I 
best show my respect for the Court and 
the Justices by being candid with them 
about where I think they have made 
grievous mistakes or where they have 
been led astray. 
So these are not your ordinary briefs. 
This one was about the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Board, and I focused 
on the favor-seeking interests that 
caused the underlying 2008 meltdown 
and how those same favor-seeking in-
terests were interested in undoing the 
Consumer Financial Protection Board 
so they could get back to the same 
mischief again. I talked about the dan-
gers of corruption from those interests. 
Well, those are powerful interests. To 
talk about them in that way in an ami-
cus brief is not nothing. 
Now, the brief talks about the fake 
notion of freedom that some espouse, 
which is, for instance, the freedom to 
pollute as opposed to the freedom to 
have a clean river free of the pollution. 
That freedom—the freedom to harm 
consumers—that freedom is a fake and 
wrong freedom, and we said so quite 
clearly in this brief. We talked about 
the value of regulation that we have 
clean air and water, that we have safe 
pharmaceuticals, that we have an or-
derly economy, and that people are not 
cheated in stock swindles because we 
have a regulatory system that has 
knowledgeable people in it who devote 
their careers to looking out for the 
public against very clever and often 
wily special interests. 
We push back hard on the notion that 
deregulation is a great asset. In fact, 
we pointed out that the failures of reg-
ulation have almost always occurred 
when the regulated interest got too 
much control over the regulator and 
got into the mischief business through 
the regulator, but honest regulation 
has been almost always a virtue for our 
country. 
We went after this thing called the 
unitary executive theory and showed 
how it had been cooked up in corporate 
rightwing hothouses. This thing had 
come through like an assembly line of 
billionaire-funded 
rightwing 
phony 
front groups to propagate itself out 
into the world and tried to get some le-
gitimacy as a legal theory, and we 
went through the whole history of 
that. That is pretty rough stuff be-
cause people put a lot of money into 
trying to cook up this unitary execu-
tive theory. 
Last week, we pointed out that the 
judicial selection process that is going 
on around here right now is directly re-
lated to the deregulation process. The 
judges are being picked by special in-
terests so they will rule against regula-
tion and give special interests a break 
and they can pollute and cheat and 
harm people to a greater degree than 
they would with strong regulators. 
That was a point that we made in this 
brief. And, by the way, I quoted 
Trump’s legal counsel, Don McGahn, 
who actually said this. It is not like we 
were making it up. He called them two 
sides of the same coin—fill the court 
with judges who hate regulation and 
let the big industries deregulate and 
have more freedom to harm. 
And, finally, we did something that I 
have not done before in a brief, but be-
cause there is so much special interest 
money floating around in the Supreme 
Court and because there is so much 
mischief swirling around it, we actu-
ally put an appendix into the brief at 
the end that looked at some of the 
other amici who had showed up to show 
how often they were funded by the 
same secretive groups and how many of 
them were basically tentacles of the 
same creature, and we backed that up 
with research showing one by one how 
they had been funded and sourced thor-
oughly. 
This was not your usual Supreme 
Court brief. Why do I dwell on this 
brief? Because here is the name on it: 
Brief of Amici Curiae, U.S. Senator 
SHELDON
WHITEHOUSE, 
RICHARD 
BLUMENTHAL, MAZIE HIRONO in Support 
of Court-Appointed Amicus 
Curiae, 
Stephen D. Susman, Counsel of Record. 
Like the thousands of pleadings that 
bear Steve Susman’s name, so did this 
brief. 
He took a chance to sign on a brief 
that was written the way we wrote this 
one. He did not mind. He knew that 
what we were saying was right. He was 
willing to put his name behind that, 
even though it might have caused 
blowback because that is the kind of 
man he was, and I will miss that. We 
have too little of that in this country 
these days, and, Steve, God speed. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. COONS. So our respect to Steve 
Susman, a man of rare courage. 
With that, I yield the floor.

IN HONOR OF ROY ‘‘SWEDE’’ 
BOREEN’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 27, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Roy ‘‘Swede’’ Boreen and wish him 
a very happy 100th birthday. 
The attack on Pearl Harbor was an event 
that not only shaped the course of our country 
but the lives of many Americans, including Mr. 
Boreen. When Pearl Harbor was attacked on 
December 7, 1941, he was one of the many 
heroes who reported for duty on the USS 
Oklahoma (BB–37). A shopkeeper with the 
United States Navy, Mr. Boreen was the only 
survivor from the battleship’s pay office. For 
over two decades, he showed endless bravery 
and courage in his pursuit of peace across the 
globe. 
After completing active duty, Mr. Boreen 
moved to Virginia with his wife, Cora Evans, 
and began a successful career in the elec-
tronics industry. They both enjoyed a round of 
golf and in 1982, settled in Pinehurst, North 
Carolina. As a couple they were seen regu-
larly on the courses in and around our com-
munity and volunteered at the Sandhills Food 
Bank, Sandhills Little Theatre, and numerous 
golf tournaments. 
Mr. Boreen was born on July 30, 1920 and 
represents the best our nation has to offer. I 
am proud to join our community today in hon-
oring all that he has accomplished over the 
last 100 years. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
thanking Roy ‘‘Swede’’ Boreen for his service 
and wishing him a happy 100th birthday.

JOSEPH W. DEVINE 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 27, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend Washington 
Township, New Jersey resident Joseph W. 
Devine on his outstanding leadership. 
Joseph Devine and his wife, Dina Devine, 
live in Washington Township, New Jersey and 
are proud parents to their two married daugh-
ters. Joseph attended La Salle University 
where he first obtained his Bachelor of 
Science and went on to earn his MBA from St. 
Joseph’s University. From 2013–2020, Joe 
served as President and Chief Experience Of-
ficer for Jefferson Health of New Jersey. He 
also diligently served as Chair of the Board of 
the Chamber of Commerce of South Jersey, 
Executive Club Chairman of the Gloucester 
County Chamber of Commerce and as a 
Commissioner of the South Jersey Transpor-
tation Authority where his responsibilities in-
cluded ensuring safe public transportation and 
transportation projects to support the economy 
of Southern New Jersey. 
Formerly known as Kennedy Health Alli-
ance, Jefferson Health New Jersey’s Primary 
and Specialty Care network of medical prac-
tices grew significantly under Joe’s leadership 
to more than 200 care providers based at over 
40 South Jersey locations since 2013. As a 
former ‘‘Heart of Gold’’ recipient from the Wigs 
and Wishes Foundation in 2017, Joe strives to 
promote safe, high-quality patient care and a 
strong, caring, working community. During his 
time as President, Jefferson Health New Jer-
sey 
was 
named 
‘‘Top 
Workplace’’ 
by 
Philly.com five times between 2013 and 2018. 
Jefferson Health has achieved countless 
systemwide achievements under Joe’s leader-
ship. In 2015, Jefferson received a $1.4 million 
grant from the New Jersey Department of 
Health to facilitate a more veteran and military 
friendly network of integrated care within the 
state. Under his presidency in 2016, Jefferson 
Health was the only hospital nationwide to re-
ceive the Sepsis Hero National Award from 
the Sepsis Alliance. To grow and create op-
portunities for employees and community 
members, Jefferson Health in New Jersey be-
came the first hospital system in the state to 
establish an internship-to-employment pro-
gram, Project SEARCH, for young adults with 
disabilities. 
Joe’s outstanding leadership was also indi-
vidually recognized for a wide variety of 
achievements throughout his career. Some of 
his many awards include Joe’s ‘‘Corporate Di-
versity Award’’ from the Gloucester County 
NAACP in 2013, the Garden State Council 
Boy Scouts of America’s ‘‘Distinguished Citi-
zens Award’’ in 2014, and the ‘‘Signum Fidei 
Medal’’ in 2016 from Joe’s alma mater, La 
Salle University. Joe’s character and dedica-
tion to his community is well recognized and 
respected. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Joseph Devine for his unrelenting 
commitment to bettering his community and 
using his outstanding influence and leadership 
skills to make meaningful and lasting change 
for our community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
LEWIS 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 27, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay homage to John Robert Lewis and his 
remarkable life as we mourn his passing on 
July 17th. 
John Lewis was my trusted friend and col-
league and his passing leaves me, my col-
leagues, and our entire nation with an aching 
sadness. He was an icon, the tireless cham-
pion for justice, equality, civil rights, and 
human rights. He fought for the most vulner-
able in our society and never stopped working 
to perfect our union. 
John Lewis shaped the course of history in 
America. Profoundly moved by the Mont-
gomery bus boycott as a young man which he 
said ‘‘changed my life more than any other 
event before or since,’’ he threw his mind and 
body into the civil rights movement to advo-
cate for equal access to jobs, housing, edu-
cation, health care, public accommodations, 
and voting rights. 
John recognized at a young age the trans-
formative power of knowledge and education 
to build a better life and a better world for him-
self and others. He loved school and vividly 
remembered the hope he felt after the Su-
preme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of 
Education requiring public schools to deseg-
regate. He dreamed of attending Troy State 
University and first met Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. in 1958 when he attempted to desegregate 
the university. He would remain a fearless ad-
vocate of Dr. King’s Beloved Community for 
the rest of his life. 
John was a man of extraordinary faith . . . 
faith in God, faith in the country he loved and 
served with passion, and faith in the inherent 
goodness in all of us. He began preaching at 
a young age and after graduating high school 
he enrolled in the American Baptist Theo-
logical Seminary in Nashville and was or-
dained a Baptist minister. While in Nashville, 
he was introduced to the concept of civil dis-
obedience and ‘‘redemptive suffering’’ and 
helped organize sit-ins to desegregate public 
accommodations. His efforts served as a cata-
lyst for Nashville to become the first southern 
city to integrate its lunch counters. 
John went on to become a founding mem-
ber of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee and once again demonstrated his 
courage by becoming one of the 13 original 
Freedom Riders, allowing himself to be beaten 
and jailed in pursuit of justice while remaining 
true to nonviolence. He was one of the ‘Big 
Six’ who helped organize the March on Wash-
ington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 and 
pushed the Kennedy Administration to take up 
the cause of civil rights. 
John Lewis revered the sanctity of the right 
to vote and he was willing to die for it. He was 
at the vanguard of the struggle for equal vot-
ing rights and made history during the Selma 
to Montgomery marches when he led activists 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and was 
savagely beaten during ‘Bloody Sunday.’ Eight 
days later, President Lyndon Johnson ad-
dressed a Joint Session of Congress to call 
for the passage of the Voting Rights Act which 
would be signed into law within five months. 
John Lewis continued his fight for justice 
during his entire service of over 30 years in 
the House of Representatives where he cham-
pioned equal education, affordable health 
care, gun control, economic opportunity and 
equal rights, I’m enormously proud and deeply 
grateful to have served with him and I will al-
ways treasure our time together as col-
leagues. 
As a Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus 
on the Deadliest Cancers, I will offer an 
amendment next week to increase funding for 
Pancreatic Cancer research, the disease that 
claimed John, in loving memory of him. John 
Lewis was the living embodiment of courage 
and conviction, and a hero to tens of millions 
of Americans. He was a humble and kind man 
who served the public with honesty and integ-
rity. He was a holy man who worked every 
day to perfect our union and now he is per-
fecting heaven where he was welcomed by 
Dr. King. Future generations will be inspired 
by his faith, his courage, and his vision of 
equality for all God’s children which has 
strengthened and bettered the nation he so 
loved.

Monday, July 27, 2020 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in support of the Fiscal Year 2021 Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). 
This year’s NDAA provides our nation’s 
service members with the resources they need 
to succeed and upholds the values and pro-
tects the interests of our nation with important 
investments in people, equipment and infra-
structure. 
In addition to paying our troops, getting 
them the gear they need, and ‘‘providing for 
the common defense,’’ this year’s NDAA goes 
above and beyond. It makes sure that we are 
preparing for future pandemics, it creates a 
more inclusive military by establishing a new 
Chief Diversity Officer, and it takes on climate 
change. 
Two other important areas of investment are 
supporting veterans transitioning to civilian life 
and fighting domestic terror. 
Importantly, I want to highlight two provi-
sions that I appreciate are included in this bill. 
The first is formally codifying the proven 
Boots to Business training program. Now more 
than ever, Boots to Business is invaluable for 
servicemembers transitioning into civilian life 
and a struggling economy. It’s already trained 
more than 100,000 servicemembers on the 
essentials of entrepreneurship and business 
management. This Obama-era program would 
be codified into law through this amendment. 
Now turning to my second amendment. For 
some time now, I have been working to en-
hance the federal government’s efforts to com-
bat domestic terrorism, specifically through my 
bill, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 
2020. 
Domestic terrorism, and in particular far- 
right extremism, is a growing threat to our na-
tion. Concerningly, and our military is not ex-
empt from this problem. 
The military has grappled with extremists, 
including White supremacist and neo-Nazi, in-
filtration of their ranks for some time. 
We saw both active duty and former service 
members playing a prominent role in the dis-
turbing violence at the White Supremacist 
Charlottesville rally. 
And despite statements from military leaders 
at the time condemning these actions, recent 
events highlight the need to address this issue 
urgently. 
Recent arrests of individuals with ties to the 
Boogaloo Movement—an extremist organiza-
tion seeking a second Civil War—include Staff 
Sergeant Steven Carrillo. 
Private First Class Shandon Simpson par-
ticipated in neo-Nazi forums. 
And Private Ethan Melzer is charged with 
sharing classified information to a neo-Nazi 
group in order to plan an attack on his own 
unit. 
We cannot let this insidious contamination 
continue. This year’s NDAA will include my 
amendment to strengthen reporting on extrem-
ist activity in the military. We need to fully un-
derstand the problem to effectively combat it 
and root out extremism in the military. 
While I will continue to seek passage of my 
Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020, I 
am pleased we are taking steps forward with 
this NDAA with respect to combating extre-
mism in the military and ensuring the safety of 
all Americans. 
I have been working hard on these priorities 
to take care of our service members returning 
home and to root out extremism and hate. So 
I’m pleased that these initiatives have been in-
cluded in this essential piece of legislation. 
HONORING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF 
TERRY SLOAN 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 27, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate Terry Sloan for thirty- 
two years of federal service, including five 
years as the National Records Center Director 
within the Department of Homeland Security’s 
United States Citizenship and Immigration 
Services (USCIS). Prior to joining USCIS in 
2008, Ms. Sloan held various legal and leader-
ship positions within the Department of De-
fense and the Department of Commerce. Rec-
ognized as an outstanding public servant 
throughout her illustrious career, Ms. Sloan’s 
long list of accomplishments have been cele-
brated with several prestigious awards, includ-
ing the Department of the Army Civilian Serv-
ice Achievement Medal. Once named the 
USCIS Manager of the Year, Ms. Sloan was 
appointed to the Senior Executive Service in 
2015, making her a civil-service equivalent to 
a general officer within the United States mili-
tary. Having served the US, federal govern-
ment for over three decades, including a half- 
decade at the helm of the USCIS National 
Records Center, Ms. Sloan’s example of lead-
ership and public service is well-worth reflect-
ing upon. 
Lee’s Summit, Missouri became home to 
the USCIS National Records Center in 1999, 
when the country’s most extensive collection 
of immigrant records was moved to a lime-
stone cave sixty feet below ground. Currently 
holding nearly sixty-million immigrant files, an-
other one-and-a-half million records are added 
each year to the countless shelves within this 
four-hundred-and-fifty-thousand square foot re-
pository. Among these, the National Records 
Center houses the immigration files belonging 
to highly acclaimed cultural icons who immi-
grated to the United States, including John 
Lennon, Salvador Dali, and Elizabeth Taylor. 
Receiving over six hundred FOIA requests 
each day, the USCIS National Records Center 
documents contain our country’s immigration 
history through the eyes of individual immi-
grants who journeyed across the globe before 
stepping foot on American shores, As new 
files arrive at the National Records Center by 
the truckload, the eight hundred employees 
and contractors employed within the vast facil-
ity work around the clock to retrieve docu-
ments needed to determine immigrant status 
for granting government benefits. 
As the Director of the USCIS National 
Records Center, Ms. Sloan had the profound 
responsibility of managing this immense, ever- 
growing repository to ensure that the history of 
immigration to the United States is properly 
archived, made accessible to the public, and 
preserved for future generations. In 2016, 
while serving as the National Records Cen-
ter’s Director, Ms. Sloan oversaw efforts to lo-
cate photographs of five immigrants who lost 
their lives in the terrorist attacks on the World 
Trade Center. For fifteen years, it had proved 
impossible to find images of these five individ-
uals. However, when Ms. Sloan and the team 
she oversaw was put to the task, portraits of 
all five victims were quickly discovered and 
then shipped to the National September 11 
Memorial and Museum for public display—a

striking testament to the record center’s archi-
val excellence. Ms. Sloan has promoted inno-
vation and efficiency through strategic initia-
tives such as document digitization, the 
proactive disclosure of records, and the use of 
modern 
case-processing 
technology. 
Ms. 
Sloan championed the Freedom of Information 
Act Immigration Records System, otherwise 
known as FIRST—the only government-used, 
end-to-end, automated, electronic FOIA sys-
tem that allows users to submit and track 
FOIA requests and receive their documents 
digitally. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in com-
memorating thirty-two years of public service 
from Ms. Terry Sloan. At the base of the Stat-
ue of Liberty, a poem written by Emma Laz-
arus welcomes people from all lands with the 
promise of the United States. ‘‘Give me your 
tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearn-
ing to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of 
your teeming shore,’’ the poem reads. Thanks 
to the service of Ms. Terry Sloan, the millions 
of people who embraced those words as they 
made way to America will have their history 
preserved for future generations of scholars, 
authors, genealogists, and curious descend-
ants.

Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I include in the

the following exchange of cor-

MCCOLLUM, and Ranking Member DAVID 
JOYCE.

DEAR CHAIR MCCOLLUM AND RANKING MEM-
BER JOYCE: I want to thank you for your 
work on the Fiscal Year 2021 Interior, Envi-
ronment, and Related Agencies appropria-
tions bill, particularly your inclusion of lan-
guage that transitions the 105(l) Lease Pro-
gram to an indefinite appropriation for such 
sums that are necessary. Funding the 105(l) 
Lease Program in this manner will uphold 
the federal government’s trust responsibility 
to Alaska Natives and American Indians and 
support village clinics in Alaska that rely 
greatly on the program. 
I write today about a provision in the bill 
that would limit the federal compensation 
for leases under the program to portions of 
tribal facilities that are ‘‘necessary for the 
operation of the Federal programs under the 
lease.’’ Many tribal clinics and hospitals in 
Alaska provide health care services to non- 
Natives in addition to Native beneficiaries. 
This is a vital service because often the trib-
al clinic is the only health care provider in 
a village, and most villages are not con-
nected to the road system. By providing 
service to non-Natives, these clinics are im-
proving the health outcomes for Natives 
both by preventing the spread of COVID–19 
and other illnesses and by affording the clin-
ics a broader financial base. 
I am concerned that the limiting provision 
could potentially negatively impact the op-
eration of 105(l) leases in my state. I also 
note that there is pending litigation regard-
ing this topic. 
Given our strong working relation-
ship, I respectfully request your help in 
addressing this issue in final Fiscal 
Year 2021 appropriations legislation. 
Sincerely, 
DON YOUNG, 
Congressman for all Alaska.

HONORING LARRY HYDE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 27, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the accom-
plishments of Larry Hyde, the 2020 Napa Val-
ley Grower of the Year. 
After attending the University of California at 
Berkeley for political science and the Univer-
sity of California at Davis for chemistry, Mr. 
Hyde began his career in the wine community 
as a vineyard crew supervisor at Ridge Vine-
yard. Over the next decade, he worked for 
several prestigious vineyards, including Gallo, 
Cuvaison, Stag’s Leap, Robert Mondavi, and 
Joseph Phelps Vineyards. In 1979, he estab-
lished Hyde Vineyards in Napa. Originally 72 
acres, Hyde Vineyards has grown to nearly 
200 acres and produces more than 15 vine-
yard designated wines. 
Mr. Hyde’s contributions to the wine com-
munity extends beyond the confines of his 
vineyard. His leadership within the industry is 
exemplary, having served as a director of the 
Napa County Farm Bureau, a founding direc-
tor of the Carneros Quality Alliance, and a 
board 
member 
of 
the 
Napa 
Valley 
Grapegrowers. He has also worked with the 
County of Napa to implement plans to eradi-
cate invasive pests that threaten vineyards 
across the region. 
Perhaps the best testament to Mr. Hyde’s 
dedication to his fellow viticulturists is his ex-
tensive work with the University of California 
at Davis’ Foundation Plant Services. For 
years, he has helped the FPS map plant ma-
terial from historic California vineyards and 
gather plant material from his own vineyard to 
be classified. Because of his efforts, more 
than 45 different clones of grapes have been 
preserved by FPS, many of which would have 
been lost without him. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Hyde is a community 
member we should all strive to be. His pas-
sion for viticulture and dedication to his fellow 
viticulturalists makes him deserving of the title 
of Napa Valley Grower of the Year. It is there-
fore fitting and proper that we honor Larry 
Hyde here today.

ENGELBERT A. ANDL 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 27, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Maple 
Shade, New Jersey resident Engelbert A. 
Andl. 
Engelbert A. Andl was born in Bakowjjako, 
Hungary on October 26, 1935. He immigrated 
to the United States of America where he has 
been a lifelong resident of Maple Shade, New 
Jersey ever since. 
At the age of 26, Engelbert Andl proudly 
served in the United States Army from 1961 to 
1965. After his service, he became the co- 
owner of Edsamm Machine Shop in Maple 
Shade. Bert was very active in his community 
and served as president of the German Men’s 
Club and was a member of The Hansa Club. 
In addition, he and his wife were also mem-
bers of the congregation of the Our Lady of 
Perpetual Help Church. In his free time, he 
loved to play cards and enjoyed traveling. 
Engelbert A. Andl was the devoted husband 
to the late Mary Andl. He is survived by his 
two sons Joseph and Steven (MariJean) Andl, 
and 
his 
four 
grandchildren 
Michelle, 
Christyanna, Victoria, and Joshua. He was a 
beloved brother to Francis (Imre) Markus, 
Maria (the late Paul) Olshanski, John (Denise) 
Andl, and Stephen Andl and will be missed as 
the beloved uncle to many nieces and neph-
ews. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring the late Mr. Engelbert A. Andl, of 
Maple Shade, New Jersey, a dedicated vet-
eran and celebrated member of the commu-
nity.

HONORING CARMEN CASTELLANO 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 27, 2020 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the many contributions of Carmen 
Castellano to educational, philanthropic, and 
artistic pursuits in our San Jose community. 
Carmen has passed away at the age of 81 
and is survived by her husband, Al, and their 
three children, Maria, Armando, and Carmela. 
This loss is deeply felt across our community. 
Carmen was born in Watsonville and grad-
uated from Moreland Notre Dame High 
School, later completing the Executive Sec-
retary program at Heald Business College. 
She worked as an Executive Secretary at 
Cabrillo College. I first met her when she 
worked as an administrative secretary and of-
fice manager at San Jose City College which 
she did for 33 years. During her time at City 
College, she was president of the classified 
employees’ senate and co-founded the Latino 
Education Association. For her support of San 
Jose City College, the school named its arts 
center after her in 2012. 
I’ve never been a big fan of the California 
lottery, but it was wonderful and exciting when 
Carmen and Al won hundreds of millions in 
the lottery. It couldn’t have happened to a 
nicer couple. When I knew Carmen and Al be-
fore the lottery win, I knew them as a team 
that was constantly volunteering for the com-
munity. I have very fond memories of the 
hours they dedicated to raising college schol-
arship money with the American GI Forum. It 
wasn’t a surprise to me, then, that they took 
the lottery winnings and used them for good in 
our community. 
Almost immediately after their win, Carmen 
and Al formed the Castellano Family Founda-
tion and started directing grants in support of 
Santa Clara County causes. They focused 
their Foundation on the Arts and Latino orga-
nizations, and it served to amplify artistic 
voices in our community. Through the Founda-
tion, they helped fund a black-box theater at 
the MACLA gallery in downtown San Jose, the 
Castellano Playhouse, and, among many oth-
ers, provided support to Cinequest, Teatro Vi-
sion, San Jose Jazz, and Los Lupen˜os de San 
Jose. The City of San Jose honored Carmen 
and Al for their work with the creative commu-
nity with the Cornerstone of the Arts Award in 
2015. 
In addition to the Castellano Family Founda-
tion, Carmen was active on several Boards 
throughout the years, including the Board of 
the National Association of Latino Arts and 
Culture and the Latina Coalition of Silicon Val-
ley, as well as the Santa Clara County Office 
of Education’s Artspiration initiative steering 
committee. Admirably, Carmen pushed every 
organization that she worked with toward di-
versity and inclusion—toward equity. For 
many, she has been a role model and a bea-
con. Her legacy helps fuel the work that is still 
cut out for all of us in San Jose. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to recog-
nize and commend Carmen Castellano for her 
unwavering commitment to the vibrancy of our 
community. We miss her greatly.

CRITICAL NEED FOR DIRECT, 
FLEXIBLE, LOCALITY ASSISTANCE 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 27, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
shine a light on the critical need for equitable, 
direct, and flexible locality assistance in up-
coming COVID relief legislation in the face of 
the dire COVID–19 economic and public 
health crisis. Locality revenues have fallen 
precipitously, forcing communities to make 
overwhelmingly difficult decisions, including to 
furlough emergency first responders who are 
needed now more than ever. 
Due to Republican provisions that diverted 
CARES Act locality assistance largely to state 
capitals, 
hardworking 
communities 
under 
500,000 across the nation and Northern Ohio 
were severely shortchanged. These provisions 
largely favored financial power and capital 
centers leaving Main Street communities be-
hind. The rich get richer and the poor get 
poorer. Welcome to the Trump Swamp. 
I include in the RECORD an OPED I wrote to 
shine a light on these concerning provisions. 
In response, the Democratic House took ac-
tion and passed the HEROES Act to provide 
direct assistance to every locality. Every mu-
nicipality would receive assistance for two fis-
cal years based on a modified CDBG formula, 
and all counties would receive a population- 
based allocation. 
While this critical legislation passed the 
House of Representatives in May, it continues 
to languish in the Senate still awaiting action. 
I call on our Republican colleagues in the 
Senate and the Trump Administration to take 
action now. Too much is at stake for more 
handwringing. 
THE CARES CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUND—A 
ROBIN HOOD PLAN FOR THE RICH 
(By Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur) 
In this important Presidential election 
year, let me define a key difference between 
Republicans and Democrats. Democrats fight 
for all people. Republicans don’t. That is 
why Democrats created Social Security and 
Medicare for every American. That is why 
Democrats are fighting to pass the HEROES 
Act (H.R. 6800) to help all people in commu-
nities impacted by the COVID–19 recession. 
Republicans are not. Every American can 
gauge the fairness or unfairness of the Re-
publican-drafted CARES Act (H.R. 748) vs. 
the Democratic-drafted HEROES bill by 
their return of your tax dollars to help your 
community. 
Despite the proportionally higher COVID– 
19 infection rates in the time of greatest 
human need, the majority of northern Ohio 
communities I represent like Cleveland, Lo-
rain, Sandusky, and Toledo got nothing that 
can be described as fair or proportionate 
from the CARES Act. How can this be as 
Donald Trump kicked off his 2020 campaign 
in northern Ohio in Toledo on January 9, 
2020? He made countless promises to help the 
City and its people. He promised his audience 
steel jobs were back at nearby Lorain mills, 
which was an outright falsehood. 
Let’s do a bit of simple math. If $150 billion 
of the CARES State/Local Coronavirus Relief 
Fund were divided equally per capita based 
on U.S. population in each jurisdiction, 
every community in our nation would be re-
ceiving close to $454.50 per person times the 
population of that community. In a fair allo-
cation formula, that amount of funding 
would be multiplied by the population of the 
jurisdiction (based on the most recent Cen-
sus data) to obtain a fair share of federal 
CARES support to your community. If your 
community, for example, has a population of 
100 people, your community would get back 
$45,450 to help preserve your emergency cov-
erage or pay your community’s part time 
doctor. 
In Lorain, with a population of 64,000, this 
would equal $29 million. Instead, Lorain gets 
$0. In Cleveland, with a population of 384,000, 
this would equal $174 million. Instead Cleve-
land gets $0. 
Mind you, our communities were not the 
only ones completely shortchanged. In Flint, 
Michigan with a population of 96,000, a fair 
allocation would return $44 million. Instead, 
Flint gets $0. In Pittsburgh, PA with a popu-
lation of 301,048, a fair return would be $137 
million. Instead, Pittsburgh gets $0. Gary, IN 
with a population of 75,000, should have re-
ceived $34 million. Instead, Gary gets $0. Du-
luth, MN has a population of 86,000, and 
should have received $39 million. Instead, 
Duluth gets $0. Des Moines, IA has a popu-
lation of 217,000, and should have received $99 
million. Instead, it gets $0. Little Rock, AR, 
with a population of 198,000, should have re-
ceived $90 million. Instead, it gets $0. Jack-
son, MS has a population of 164,422. Its fair 
share would have been $75 million, yet it got 
$0. The list of losers across the Heartland 
and South is long: Peoria, St. Louis, Keno-
sha, Charleston, Des Moines, New Orleans, 
Selma, Birmingham, St. Paul, Grand Rapids, 
Nashville, and many others. 
Senate Republicans drafted a Robin Hood 
bill for the rich. Their numbers-juggling 
took 
from 
struggling 
communities 
and 
transferred funds to the richest. The Trump 
formula tilts heavily against Main Street 
America. It diverts critical funds to finan-
cial power and capital city centers, and es-
sentially metropolises with over 500,000 per-
sons. For example, New York City received 
$1.45 billion, San Francisco $154 million, and 
Chicago $469 million. Based on an equitable, 
per 
capita 
distribution 
of 
CARES 
Coronavirus Relief Funds, each Congres-
sional District should have received close to 
$345 million. Instead, while districts with the 
highest median income were taken care of, 
those with the lowest median incomes clear-
ly lost out. In fact, the urban district I rep-
resent ranks 403 out of 435 congressional dis-
tricts in median income per household, and 
received nothing that could be considered 
fair. Of the top 30 wealthiest Congressional 
Districts, all but two received a handsome 
allocation. Yet, for the bottom 86 Districts, 
only 20 received something close to equi-
table. The rich get richer and the poor get 
poorer. Welcome to the Trump swamp. 
Further, due to provisions included in the 
CARES Act by Republican Senators and the 
White House, over $87.5 billion in CARES 
funding is slated directly to a majority of

Republican controlled State capitals to dis-
tribute. To be exact, 59% of all State legisla-
tures controlled by Republicans will redis-
tribute your tax dollars. As a result, state 
governments will determine through a lop-
sided political process, which communities 
do and don’t receive federal relief dollars. 
For example, a recent Ohio Senate Bill (S.B. 
310) proposes to distribute only 7.7% of its 
$4.533 billion federal allocation to localities, 
which translates to $29.90 per capita vs. a fair 
allocation of $454.50 per capita from the 
CARES Act. At a time of such national 
stress, how repugnant is this Republican un-
equal distribution. In effect, communities 
across Northern Ohio are being shortchanged 
and losing millions of dollars: Cleveland 
(¥$163 million), Toledo (¥$117 million), Lo-
rain (¥$27 million), Lakewood (¥$22 mil-
lion), and Parma (¥$33.4 million).

In the CARES Act, Republican rural, and 
small states were also guaranteed $1.5 billion 
regardless of their population, or COVID in-
fection rates. When topline CARES states/lo-
cality funding is analyzed and the allocation 
divided evenly by population, Ohio received 
an average $388 per capita. Yet, Republican 
states like South Dakota received $1,413 per 
capita, Alaska received $1,709, Wyoming 
$2,160, and North Dakota $1,640. How is a 
hard-working Ohioan from a community 
that has already suffered deindustrialization 
and outsourcing worth less than other Amer-
icans?

To address these grievous injustices, I led 
an effort to request Treasury Secretary Ste-
ven Mnuchin to certify ‘‘Locality’’ assist-
ance of northern Ohio’s two economic re-
gions whose population does exceed 500,000 
persons—the Northeast Ohio Areawide Co-
ordinating Agency’s (NOACA) and Toledo 
Metropolitan Area Council of Governments’ 
(TMACOG). Secretary Mnuchin dismissed 
the requests out of hand stating, ‘‘Treasury 
relied on data from the U.S. Census Bureau.’’ 
Our regions should qualify by any reasonable 
measure of economic performance, COVID– 
19, and population distribution. 
In effect, the CARES Act authorizes the 
disbursement of an enormous sum of money 
back to only some communities, but not all. 
The bill picks winners and losers. It does not 
give equal amounts based on population and 
certainly not need. It is very lopsided. By 
contrast, the HEROES Act leaves no commu-
nity out. This bill would provide a fairer al-
location to municipalities for two fiscal 
years based on a modified Community Devel-
opment Block Grant formula. All counties 
would receive direct funding based on popu-
lation. While this legislation has passed the 
House of Representatives, it is sitting in the 
Senate and awaiting action. 
Democratic Ways and Means Chairman 
Richard Neal best summed up Democratic 
dismay: ‘‘Remember, Democrats control only 
one half of one third of the government of 
the United States.’’ The American people 
now must keep their eyes peeled on the Re-
publican Senate and their state legislatures. 
Otherwise, millions of Americans are going 
to face their municipalities declaring bank-
ruptcy with the massive furloughing of po-
lice officers, firefighters, emergency service 
personnel, and other first responders. Bank-
ruptcy of America’s communities may be 
Senator Mitch McConnell’s solution. That is 
barbarian. We owe a fair shake to the Amer-
ican people in all our communities. Let’s fix 
the skewed formula in the CARES Act. En-
sure population-based, fair allocations of fed-
eral coronavirus relief funding in future leg-
islation. Democrats must lead with equity. 
Shortchange no region. Restore fairness to 
the American people.

SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, 
agreed to by the Senate of February 4, 
1977, calls for establishment of a sys-
tem for a computerized schedule of all 
meetings and hearings of Senate com-
mittees, subcommittees, joint commit-
tees, and committees of conference. 
This title requires all such committees 
to notify the Office of the Senate Daily 
Digest—designated by the Rules Com-
mittee—of the time, place and purpose 
of the meetings, when scheduled and 
any cancellations or changes in the 
meetings as they occur. 
As an additional procedure along 
with the computerization of this infor-
mation, the Office of the Senate Daily 
Digest will prepare this information for 
printing in the Extensions of Remarks 
section of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
on Monday and Wednesday of each 
week. 
Meetings scheduled for Tuesday, July 
28, 2020 may be found in the Daily Di-
