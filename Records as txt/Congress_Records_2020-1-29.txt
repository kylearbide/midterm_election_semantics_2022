UNITED 
STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE 
AGREEMENT 
BECOMES 
LAW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, today, at long last, the 
United 
States-Mexico-Canada 
trade 
agreement, USMCA, will officially be-
come law. USMCA is a major win not 
only for American farmers, ranchers, 
manufacturers, and business owners, 
but for each and every American who 
depends on these industries. 
Thanks to the leadership of the 
Trump administration, we are deliv-
ering real results for the men and 
women who are the backbone of the 
American economy. Freer markets, 
fairer trade, and increased opportunity 
are on the horizon as USMCA is signed 
today and implemented. 
The numbers are staggering: more 
than $68 billion in new economic activ-
ity, approximately 176,000 new jobs, 
and an increase of more than $2 billion 
a year in agriculture exports. It is no 
wonder that USMCA passed with over-
whelming bipartisan support in both 
the House and the Senate. 
USMCA 
brings 
particularly 
good 
news for the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania. In 2018 alone, Pennsylvania 
exported approximately $15 billion in 
goods to Canada and Mexico, and 
USMCA continues to open doors for our 
producers. 
As Pennsylvania’s number one indus-
try, agriculture is vital to the health of 
both the economy and our residents, as 
our farmers provide the food, the fiber, 
the energy, the building materials, and 
all that we depend upon. With in-
creased market opportunities, the fu-
ture of the Keystone State is brighter 
than ever. 
That being said, it is impossible to 
talk about the impact USMCA will 
have on Pennsylvania without talking 
about dairy. For far too long, our Na-
tion’s dairy producers have been sub-
ject to Canada’s unfair class 6 and class 
7 ultrafiltered pricing programs, lim-
iting our export potential both into 
Canada and, quite frankly, into Third 
World countries as Canada floods them 
with dairy components of whey and 
lactose, proteins and powdered milk. 
Thanks to USMCA, this is a thing of 
the past. 
A 21st century economy requires 21st 
century trade policy, and with USMCA, 
we are sending a crystal-clear message 
to our trade partners around the globe: 
America is open for business. 
THE OBAMA ECONOMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, in 
2016, I wrote this op-ed, ‘‘Seven Years 
of Change You Can See and Feel.’’ I 
wrote it in the backdrop of the election 
of President Barack Obama and his 
opening remarks and his inauguration 
that said: ‘‘Today I say to you that the 
challenges we face are real. They are 
serious and they are many. They will 
not be met easily or in a short span of 
time. But know this America: They 
will be met.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the op-ed I authored. 
[From the Washington Examiner, Feb. 17, 
2016] 
SEVEN YEARS OF CHANGE YOU CAN SEE AND 
FEEL 
(By Sheila Jackson Lee) 
The morning of January 20, 2009 was one of 
the coldest days on record in Washington, 
DC. But this was nothing compared to the 
chill wind blowing through the American 
economy and body politic. The nation was 
facing economic challenges unseen since the 
Great Depression: Americans were losing 
their jobs at a frightening rate of 800,000 per 
month; the national unemployment rate had 
risen to 7.8 percent and would continue to 
climb until reaching its peak of 10.0 percent 
in October 2009. 
For African Americans, the numbers were 
much grimmer: A jobless rate of 13.5 percent 
in January 2009 which would grow to 16.5 per-
cent by the end of the year. And on top of 
this, tens of thousands of American families 
each month were losing their health insur-
ance and their homes to foreclosure. The 
United States was still bogged down in the 
quagmire that was the Iraq War and young 
people by the thousands were being forced to 
defer or drop out of college because of lack of 
financial aid. And the average price of gas 
exceeded $4 per gallon. 
It was against this backdrop that I 
watched from the inaugural platform as 
Barack Obama, surrounded by his radiant 
and beautiful wife, Michelle, and their two 
adorable daughters, rose to take the oath of 
office. After being sworn in as the nation’s

January 29, 2020 
44th president of the United States, Obama 
reassured an anxious but hopeful nation, 
saying: 
‘‘Today I say to you that the challenges we 
face are real. They are serious and they are 
many. They will not be met easily or in a 
short span of time. But know this America: 
They will be met.’’ 
Watching Barack Obama address the na-
tion that day, spectators in attendance and 
viewers across the country and around the 
world understood they were witnessing a his-
toric president, the first African American 
ever to hold the nation’s highest office. 
But more than being a historic president, 
Barack Obama’s actions and leadership over 
the ensuing seven years would demonstrate 
that his would be a consequential presidency 
that changed America for the better. 
His first and most pressing task was to res-
cue an economy on the brink of collapse. 
Working with the Democratic-controlled 
Congress, the American Recovery and Rein-
vestment Act was passed, which created 3.7 
million jobs and saved the jobs of millions of 
teachers, firefighters, police officers and so-
cial service providers. The Recovery Act also 
cut taxes for working families, extended un-
employment insurance, and expanded the 
Earned Income and Child Tax Credits, which 
disproportionately benefit African American 
families. 
Seven years later the verdict is in on the 
economic plan put in place by President 
Obama and the Democratic Congress. The 
Recovery Act ended the Great Recession, 
transformed the economy from one hem-
orrhaging jobs to one that has created more 
than 16 million new jobs over a record 71 con-
secutive months. The national unemploy-
ment rate has dipped under 5 percent for the 
first time since President Clinton left office, 
the deficit has been cut by 71 percent and the 
Dow Jones stock market index topped 18,000 
in 2015, an increase of 177 percent over where 
it stood the day President Obama took of-
fice. 
As an added benefit, the average price of 
gasoline has been reduced from more than 
$4.11 per gallon to $1.80, the lowest price 
since before the tragedy of September 11. 
The seven years of Obama also effected pol-
icy change in the areas of criminal justice 
reform, health and education, national secu-
rity and foreign affairs. 
President Obama also made history by ap-
pointing two women to the U.S. Supreme 
Court, including the first Hispanic American 
to serve on the Court. He appointed the first 
African American man and woman to serve 
as attorney general and the first woman to 
chair the Federal Reserve Board. 
In the area of foreign affairs and national 
security, President Obama ended the Iraq 
War, assembled and led an international coa-
lition to impose sanctions on Iran that were 
so crippling that it was forced to the negoti-
ating table. That yielded the Iran Nuclear 
Agreement that prevents Iran from ever at-
taining a nuclear weapon. And of course, as 
the world knows, because of President 
Obama’s leadership, General Motors is alive 
and Osama Bin Laden is dead. 
For seven years, President Barack Obama 
has represented our country with grace, in-
tegrity, honor, and distinction. He has pro-
vided consolation, hope, and healing in the 
face of unspeakable tragedies such as the 
massacre of innocent children at Sandy 
Hook, worshippers at Mother Emanuel AME 
Church in Charleston, spectators at the Bos-
ton Marathon, and mass shootings in Aurora, 
Colorado and Tucson, Arizona. He expressed 
and symbolized our joy and pride in the 
progress made over the last half century— 
and the distance we still have to travel— 
when he marched across the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge and addressed the multitude from the 
spot on the steps where the Rev. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr. shared his dream for Amer-
ica’s future. 
So as President Obama serves the final 
year of his presidency, it is clear beyond 
doubt that he kept the promise he made to 
the nation seven years ago on that cold day 
in January when he said: 
‘‘Today I say to you that the challenges we 
face are real. But know this America: They 
will be met.’’ 
They were more than just met; they were 
overcome under his leadership. And because 
of President Obama, today the United States 
is stronger, more prosperous and better posi-
tioned than ever to win the future. 
And that is what makes his one of the 
most consequential presidencies in American 
history. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. In the years of 
Obama’s service, we did, together, meet 
those challenges. 
His first and most pressing task was 
to rescue an economy on the brink of 
collapse. Working with the Demo-
cratic-controlled Congress, the Amer-
ican Recovery and Reinvestment Act, 
the stimulus, was passed and created 
3.7 million jobs and saved the jobs of 
millions of teachers, firefighters, police 
officers, and social service providers. 
The Recovery Act also cut taxes for 
working families, extended unemploy-
ment insurance, and expanded the 
earned income and child tax credit, 
which disproportionately benefits Afri-
can Americans. The challenge was met. 
So any discussion of any excitement 
about the work of this administration 
creating an economy, it is an economy 
that was literally given to them be-
cause of the work of President Obama 
and the Democratic Caucus. 
We have, now, $2 trillion extra in 
debt. We have the pending possibility 
of wars. We have the continuing down-
ward spiral of issues that will impact 
this economy. 
So, with this terrible tax cut, we 
were not given a strong economy. We 
paid an extremely high price: $1.9 tril-
lion for tax cuts has done little for the 
economy. There is no such thing as a 
bump by this administration. Key indi-
cators are saying that things, in actu-
ality, are worse. 
The Joint Economic Committee says 
unemployment was cut by more than 
half during the Obama administration, 
from a peak of 10 percent to 4 percent. 
The economy had experienced 76 con-
secutive months of job growth. The 
GDP growth was strong, an average of 
2.6 percent in 11 quarters of the Obama 
administration. Growth in annual me-
dian household income was strong and 
trending upward, increasing $4,800 dur-
ing those last 2 years. And the Chair-
man of the Council of Economic Advi-
sors under George W. Bush states that 
the economy was in fine shape at the 
end of the Obama administration, de-
spite what President Trump now as-
serts. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the Joint Economic Committee article. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT CREATE THE STRONG 
ECONOMY; HE INHERITED IT 
President Trump regularly claims the 
economy he inherited was a ‘‘mess,’’ but fact 
checkers have found this to false. Before 
Trump took office in January 2017, the econ-
omy had largely recovered from the Great 
Recession. Overall economic indicators were 
already strong and were trending stronger. 
Unemployment had been cut by more than 
half during the Obama administration, from 
a peak of 10 percent to 4.7 percent. 
The economy had experienced 76 consecu-
tive months of job growth. 
GDP growth was strong—an average of 2.6 
percent growth in the last 11 quarters of the 
Obama administration. 
Growth in annual median household in-
come was strong and trending upward, in-
creasing $4,800 during the last two years of 
the Obama administration. 
Greg Mankiw, chairman of the Council of 
Economic Advisers under President George 
W. Bush, states that ‘‘the economy was in 
fine shape at the end of the Obama adminis-
tration, despite what President Trump some-
times asserts.’’ 
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A ‘‘TRUMP BUMP’’— 
KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS ARE THE SAME OR 
WORSE 
Last week, the president said ‘‘we have the 
greatest economy we’ve ever had in the his-
tory of our country.’’ This claim did not 
make it by the fact checkers at The Associ-
ated Press. A few facts to keep in mind: 
Monthly non-farm job growth has slowed 
in the first 35 months of the Trump adminis-
tration compared to the last 35 months of 
the Obama administration—36,000 fewer jobs 
per month under Trump. 
Average real GDP growth has been roughly 
the same for the first 11 quarters under 
Trump and the last 11 quarters of the Obama 
administration. 
Growth in median annual household in-
come was three times as great during the 
last two years of the Obama administration 
as during the first two years of the Trump 
administration. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S SIGNATURE ECONOMIC POL-
ICY—THE $1.9 TRILLION TAX CUT—HAS FAILED 
TO DELIVER THE PROMISED ECONOMIC BOOST 
Trump promised the tax cuts would be like 
‘‘rocket fuel’’ to the economy, but the effects 
have been underwhelming. The economic 
boost has been very small and short-lived. 
GDP growth: Trump promised GDP growth 
as high as 6 percent. However, in the seven 
quarters before and after passage of the Re-
publican tax law, GDP growth is exactly the 
same, averaging 2.5 percent. 
Business investment: The Trump adminis-
tration predicted a flood of business invest-
ment, which is critical to long-term eco-
nomic growth. However, it actually has 
slowed since the tax cut, falling from an av-
erage annual growth rate of 4.6 percent in 
the seven quarters before enactment to a 3.5 
percent annual rate in the seven quarters 
following the tax cut. 
Household income: The administration pre-
dicted that the tax cuts would bring an in-
crease of $4,000 to $9,000 or more per house-
hold. However, household income increased 
only $550 in the first year after the tax cuts 
went into effect. 
Unemployment: It was at 4.1 percent before 
the tax cuts took effect, falling just over 
one-half of 1 percent since then. 
WE PAID AN EXTREMELY HIGH PRICE—$1.9 TRIL-
LION—FOR TAX CUTS THAT HAVE DONE SO LIT-
TLE FOR THE ECONOMY 
When it is fully implemented, the Repub-
lican tax law will add $1.9 trillion to the na-
tional debt, according to CBO. 
In just the past two fiscal years, the an-
nual deficit has increased from $666 billion in 
FY 2017 to $984 billion in FY 2019 (a 48 per-
cent increase). 
Despite a deficit forecast to exceed $1 tril-
lion for the rest of the decade and beyond,

Trump administration officials continue to 
claim the tax cuts will pay for themselves. 
In the long term, the vastly increased def-
icit likely will weigh down the economy and 
Republicans will argue that those deficits 
will require cuts to vital services and pro-
grams like Medicare and Social Security. In 
fact, the President admitted just last week 
he will look at cuts to those programs. 
TRUMP’S SECOND MAJOR ECONOMIC POLICY—THE 
TRADE
WAR—IS
A
SELF-INFLICTED
WOUND, 
HURTING
CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES
AND
THE 
ECONOMY 
Trump’s claim that China bears the entire 
cost of the tariffs is absolutely false—there 
are casualties on both sides of the trade war. 
One analysis finds that the trade war with 
China had already cost 300,000 American jobs 
as of September 2019 and the number could 
rise to 450,000 by the end of 2019. 
CBO estimated that the trade war reduced 
GDP by 0.3 percent by 2020. 
The trade war hits consumers in their wal-
lets and pocketbooks. The Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York estimated that tariffs on 
imports from China cost each U.S. household 
nearly $300 per year in 2018, and over $800 per 
year since with the additional 15 percent tar-
iff on $200 billion worth of goods. 
WHILE TRUMP CUTS TAXES FOR THE WEALTHY 
AND APPLAUDS THE STOCK MARKET, MILLIONS 
OF
AMERICANS
ARE
STRUGGLING
TO
MAKE 
ENDS MEET 
In a recent analysis, the Brookings Institu-
tion found that 53 million workers—44 per-
cent of all workers—earn just $10.22 per hour 
or about $18,000 per year. $18,000 is not 
enough to raise a family on. 
The president has begun talking about a 
blue-collar boom, but manufacturing has 
contracted in three of the last four quarters. 
The sector has added just 9,000 jobs in the 
past six months. 
MOST
OF
PRESIDENT
TRUMP’S
CLAIMS
ABOUT 
THE
ECONOMY
ARE
FALSE
OR
HIGHLY
MIS-
LEADING 
According to The Washington Post Fact 
Checker, Trump has made more than 1,500 
false claims about the economy. 
This is part of a broader pattern. Fact 
Checker has found that altogether Trump 
has made more than 16,000 false or mis-
leading claims on all topics in his first three 
years in office. 
Trump made half of those false or mis-
leading claims in 2019—the pace of these 
claims is increasing. 
Any statement the president makes about 
the economy has a good chance of being false 
or misleading. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. And so we have a 
challenge to try and recoup and re-
cover, for hardworking Americans, a 
real economy, because it is frightening 
when we begin to start losing jobs. 
Let me show how the trend went. 
We were adding 270,000 jobs per 
month under President Obama. We are 
now adding an average of 191,000 jobs 
under this present administration. And 
it can be seen very clearly that the job 
growth is challenging. 
We can also see that, when we were 
down in a slump on median household 
income, it was surging up because of 
the values and principles of the Obama 
administration 
working 
with 
the 
Democratic Congress. 
Employment was down when Mr. 
Obama took office. We can see that it 
surged up; and then it began to go 
down, with respect to this administra-
tion, and turning red again. The econ-
omy, as I said, had been growing very 
well under President Obama. 
The GOP tax scam led to a record- 
setting $1 trillion in stock buybacks, 
unlike what was represented to us, 
that that was going to create invest-
ment in this country. 
We are now beginning to put forward 
some major legislation that deals with 
investment in our infrastructure, in-
vestment in public housing and afford-
able housing, because we realize what 
creates jobs. We create jobs when we 
invest back into the Nation. We do not 
create jobs when we take tax cuts and 
give them to the rich while everybody 
else suffers. 
The GOP tax law encourages compa-
nies to send factories and jobs over-
seas. Under the GOP tax cut, income 
generated 
by 
American 
companies 
abroad face tax rates that are half the 
new top corporate rate of 21 percent. 
By the way, corporations didn’t ask 
for that low corporate tax rate. Some 
companies may be able to avoid taxes 
altogether on tangible investments 
made offshore. 
The GOP tax law increases deficits, 
as I said earlier, by $1.9 trillion when 
we are facing major budgetary chal-
lenges driven by our aging population. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would say 
that there was nothing but a gift given 
to this administration by the hard 
work of the Obama administration. 
Let us get back to investing in the 
American people. That is how we build 
the economy, not by snatching it away 
from them. 
Mr. Speaker, the verdict is now in, and it 
leads to the inescapable conclusion that the 
Trump TaxScam has not accelerated the 
economy, rather it is a significant drag on the 
booming economy President Barack Obama 
bequeathed to his successor, the current oc-
cupant of the office. 
Specifically, two points cannot be stressed 
enough. 
First, President Trump did not create the 
strong economy; he inherited it. 
Second, we paid an extremely high price— 
$1.9 trillion—for tax cuts that have done so lit-
tle for the economy. 
Mr. Speaker, most of President Trump’s 
claims about the economy are false or highly 
misleading. 
There is no such thing as a ‘‘Trump 
bump’’—key economic indicators are the same 
or worse. 
The President’s signature economic policy— 
the $1.9 trillion tax cut—has failed to deliver 
the promised economic boost and his second 
major economic policy—the trade war—is a 
self-inflicted wound, hurting farmers, con-
sumers, businesses and the economy. 
Mr. Speaker, those of us who were there re-
member well that the morning of January 20, 
2009, which was one of the coldest days on 
record in Washington, DC. 
But it was nothing compared to the chill 
wind blowing through the American economy 
and body politic because at that time the na-
tion was facing economic challenges unseen 
since the Great Depression: Americans were 
losing their jobs at a frightening rate of 
800,000 per month; the national unemploy-
ment rate had risen to 7.8 percent and would 
continue to climb until reaching its peak of 
10.0 percent in October 2009. 
For African Americans, the numbers were 
much grimmer, a jobless rate of 13.5 percent 
in January 2009 which would grow to 16.5 
percent by the end of the year. 
And on top of this, tens of thousands of 
American families each month were losing 
their health insurance and their homes to fore-
closure. 
And the average price of gas exceeded $4 
per gallon. 
It was against this backdrop that the new 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
Barack 
Obama, rose to take the oath of office. 
After being sworn in as the nation’s 44th 
President, President Obama reassured an 
anxious but hopeful nation, saying: 
‘‘Today I say to you that the challenges we 
face are real. They are serious and they are 
many. They will not be met easily or in a short 
span of time. But know this America: They will 
be met.’’ 
Because of the actions President Obama 
took, not to further the interests of himself but 
of the American people, these challenges 
were more than met and overcome and for 
that Barack Obama’s presidency is regarded 
by historians as a consequential presidency 
that changed America for the better. 
Mr. Speaker, before Trump took office in 
January 2017, the economy had recovered 
from the Great Recession and overall eco-
nomic indicators were already strong and were 
trending stronger. 
Unemployment had been cut by more than 
half during the Obama administration, from a 
peak of 10 percent to 4.7 percent. 
The economy had experienced 76 consecu-
tive months of job growth, the longest sus-
tained period of growth in American history. 
GDP growth was strong, average of 2.6 per-
cent annually in the last 11 quarters of the 
Obama Administration and median household 
income growth was strong and trending up-
ward, increasing $4,800 during in last two 
years of the Obama administration. 
Even Greg Mankiw, chairman of the Council 
of Economic Advisers under President George 
W. Bush, had to admit that ‘‘the economy was 
in fine shape at the end of the Obama admin-
istration, despite what the current President 
falsely asserts. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD an op- 
ed published on February 17, 2016 in the 
Washington Examiner, entitled ‘‘Seven Years 
of Change You Can See and Feel.’’ 
President Obama actually had a plan to 
tackle the economic woes that were affecting 
the American people. 
Working 
with 
the 
Democratic-controlled 
Congress, the President signed into law the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, 
which created 3.7 million jobs and saved the 
jobs of millions of teachers, firefighters, police 
officers, and social service providers. 
The Recovery Act also cut taxes for working 
families, extended unemployment insurance, 
and expanded the Earned Income and Child 
tax credits, which disproportionately benefit Af-
rican American families. 
The Recovery Act ended the Great Reces-
sion, transformed the economy from one hem-
orrhaging jobs to one that has created over 16 
million new jobs over a record 71 consecutive 
months.

under 5 percent, for the first time since Presi-
dent Clinton left office, the deficit has been cut

by 71 percent and the Dow Jones stock mar-
ket index topped 18,000 in 2015, an increase 
of 177 percent over where it stood the day 
President Obama took office. 
And, as an added benefit, the average price 
of gasoline has been reduced from more than 
$4.11 per gallon to $1.80, the lowest price 
since before the tragedy of September 11. 
In short, Mr. Speaker, President Obama be-
queathed a booming and vibrant economy to 
his successor, who promptly took actions to 
undermine it and explode the national debt. 
Mr. Speaker, the GOP TaxScam was the 
wrong policy at the wrong time because it 
showered benefits on the top 1 percent large 
multinational corporations while doing little for 
everyday working Americans and Main Street 
small business owners. 
GOP TaxScam also raises the nation’s debt 
by $1.9 trillion at a time when the economy 
was already strong, and when we are facing 
major long-term budgetary challenges driven 
by our aging population. 
And rather than devoting resources to wise 
investments in our workers and small busi-
nesses, the GOP TaxScam further burdens 
working families, endangers Americans’ retire-
ment security, and worsens our budgetary out-
look. 
Our long-term economic growth trajectory is 
unchanged and there is no sign of an invest-
ment boom. 
Real wage growth for workers remains mod-
est and factories and jobs are more likely to 
go overseas. 
The federal deficit is soaring as corporate 
tax receipts plummet and the tax code is rid-
dled with even more special-interest tax 
breaks and loopholes. 
THE GOP TAXSCAM LED TO A RECORD-SETTING $1 
TRILLION IN STOCK BUYBACKS 
The GOP TaxScam delivered huge benefits 
to rich investors and CEOs through record-set-
ting stock buybacks in 2018 while average 
workers struggle to pay for rising health care 
and living costs. 
Stock buybacks do nothing to improve busi-
ness operations or help workers. 
THE
GOP
TAXSCAM
SHOWERS
BENEFITS
ON
THE 
WEALTHY AND LARGE CORPORATIONS WHILE DOING 
LITTLE FOR WORKERS AND MAIN STREET SMALL BUSI-
NESSES 
The GOP tax cut is heavily tilted toward the 
wealthy and corporations and exacerbates the 
stagnation of wages for the vast majority of 
workers and worsens income and wealth in-
equality. 
The GOP tax law does nothing to help small 
businesses gain access to capital and grow 
their receipts. 
Only 5 percent of small businesses pay 
taxes at the corporate level and most of the 
pass-through tax cuts go to the largest 2.6 
percent of businesses. 
THE GOP TAX LAW ENCOURAGES COMPANIES TO SEND 
FACTORIES AND JOBS OVERSEAS 
Under the GOP tax law, income generated 
by American companies abroad face tax rates 
that are half the new top corporate rate of 21 
percent. 
Some companies may be able to avoid tax 
altogether on tangible investments made off-
shore. 
This further incentivizes companies to move 
tangible assets, such as factories and machin-
ery, overseas. 
Rather than protecting workers and their 
families, the GOP tax law tilts the playing field 
against American workers. 
THE GOP TAX LAW INCREASES DEFICITS BY $1.9 TRILLION 
WHEN
WE
ARE
FACING
MAJOR
BUDGETARY
CHAL-
LENGES DRIVEN BY OUR AGING POPULATION 
Even after accounting for any economic 
growth effects, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice (CBO) estimates the GOP tax scam in-
creases deficits by $1.9 trillion over the ten 
years 2018 to 2028—hardly the ‘‘pay for itself’ 
message we heard from the Administration 
and Republicans in Congress. 
Our friends across the aisle promised the 
GOP TaxScam would significantly boost eco-
nomic growth, spurred an investment boom, 
drove unemployment down to the lowest level 
since the 1960s, created jobs for millions of 
workers, and helped middle-class families 
keep more of their paychecks. 
All of these claims have collapsed in the 
crucible of actual experience. 
THE GOP TAXSCAM DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY BOOST THE 
ECONOMY 
In the seven quarters before and after pas-
sage of the Trump TaxScam, GDP growth is 
unchanged from the Obama economy, aver-
aging 2.5 percent. 
By 2023, the tax law’s positive effect on 
economic growth will fade away entirely. 
THE GOP TAXSCAM DOES NOT SPUR BUSINESS 
INVESTMENT 
There is no evidence of an investment 
boom, which Republicans promised would be 
the key to unleashing unprecedented eco-
nomic growth and wage gains. 
Nonresidential business investment grew by 
less than 1 percent in the third quarter of last 
year, while business’ orders for durable goods 
(another measure of investment) fell in De-
cember for the fourth time in five months. 
Instead of encouraging investment, the tax 
cut triggered a record level of stock buybacks. 
THE GOP TAXSCAM IS NOT THE CAUSE OF LOWEST 
UNEMPLOYMENT SINCE 1968 
President Trump is coasting on an eco-
nomic expansion—now the second-longest on 
record—that began under President Obama. 
The law has not changed the unemployment 
trend. 
The unemployment rate has fallen steadily 
since the end of the Great Recession. 
THE GOP TAXSCAM HAS NOT CREATED JOBS FOR 
MILLIONS OF WORKERS 
More jobs were created in President 
Obama’s last two years in office than Presi-
dent Trump’s first two years, a monthly aver-
age of 227,00 for Obama contrasted to an av-
erage of 191,000 for Trump. 
Monthly non-farm job growth has slowed in 
the first 35 months of the Trump administra-
tion compared to the last 35 months of the 
Obama administration—36,000 fewer jobs per 
month under Trump. 
The tax law also encourages companies to 
send factories and jobs overseas rather than 
protecting jobs at home. 
THE GOP TAXSCAM IS NOT HELPING MIDDLE-CLASS 
FAMILIES KEEP MORE OF THEIR PAYCHECKS 
There has been very little increase in private 
sector compensation or wages since the tax 
law passed. 
Real wage growth continues to be dis-
appointingly modest, and real bonuses in-
creased by just 2 cents per hour between De-
cember 2017 and September 2018. 
The law ignores the stagnation of working- 
class wages and worsens income and wealth 
inequality. 
In fact, only 35 percent of the tax law’s ben-
efits in 2018 will go to the bottom 80 percent 
of households making less than approximately 
$150,000 per year. 
EVEN THOUGH FEDERAL REVENUES HAVE RISEN, THE 
GOP TAXSCAM HAS CREATED A MAJOR REVENUE DEFI-
CIENCY PROBLEM 
Corporate tax receipts dropped an astound-
ing 31 percent drop in 2018, with total receipts 
as a share of GDP falling to the lowest levels 
since the end of the Great Recession despite 
healthy economic growth and a tight labor 
market. 
Revenue last year was 16.4 percent of the 
economy, almost two percentage points below 
the so-year average of 18.3 percent in years 
in which unemployment fell below 5 percent. 
By contrast, spending as a share of GDP 
last year fell right at the historical average. 
Predictably, the President and our Repub-
lican friends seeks to evade blame and re-
sponsibility for the fiscal mess and exploding 
debt they have created. 
Instead of redressing the harm caused by 
the Trump TaxScam, Republicans resort again 
to their past practice of blaming the deficit on 
the entitlement programs such as Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, SNAP, and veterans benefits 
and seek to slash these programs to the 
barebones. 
For example the President sought to cut 
non-defense discretionary (NDD) programs by 
$1.4 trillion, including cuts to Medicare and 
Medicaid, reduce funding for SNAP by $220 
billion or 22 percent, and deny infrastructure 
funding for cash-strapped state and local gov-
ernments; and pile more hardships on strug-
gling Americans with $327 billion in cuts to di-
rect spending programs that safeguard basic 
living standards they need to get by. 
The President is obsessed with dismantling 
and destabilizing health care for millions of 
Americans by making yet another attempt to 
‘‘repeal and replace’’ the Affordable Care Act 
passed under the extraordinary leadership of 
President Barack Obama which provided 
health security to more than 20 million Ameri-
cans. 
Mr. Speaker, we are now entering Act III of 
the immorality play we predicted the President 
would write. 
Act I was the cutting of taxes for the rich; 
Act II was the inevitable exploding of the def-
icit we predicted would result and our Repub-
lican friends denied would ever happen. 
And now we have Act III, in which Repub-
licans claim to have newly rediscovered their 
horror over the deficits created by their fiscal 
irresponsibility and insist that the mess they 
created but be cleaned up by slashing invest-
ments in the programs relied upon by the 90– 
95 percent of Americans who were made 
worse off by the GOP TaxScam. 
The President should be embarrassed and 
ashamed of his economic stewardship and 
thankful every day to President Obama for 
tackling and solving the major economic chal-
lenges facing Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H641 
January 29, 2020 
Frankly, the American people tuned 
out a long time ago. They find the pro-
ceeding simply boring, and rightly so. 
In fact, a recent focus group of Demo-
crats said they don’t even care about 
this impeachment trial. They are not 
interested, and they are ready to move 
on. 
The truth is that, despite all of the 
repetitive accusations of coverup, quid 
pro quo, he said, she said, et cetera, et 
cetera, this is nothing more than an at-
tempt at a soft coup against President 
Trump by the people who still can’t get 
over the fact that he beat Hillary Clin-
ton fair and square at the ballot box. 
Just listen to some of the recent 
rants made by the impeachment man-
agers. As one manager says: ‘‘The 
President’s misconduct cannot be de-
cided at the ballot box, for we cannot 
be assured that the vote will be fairly 
won.’’ 
What an insult to American voters. If 
we can’t trust the American voters, 
who can we trust? Does he think they 
are gullible? Does he think he is better 
than them? 
Or take the comments of another im-
peachment manager, a Democrat. He 
said, referring to President Trump: ‘‘He 
is a dictator. This must not stand, and 
that is another reason he must be re-
moved from office.’’ 
These are insulting to the American 
public who chose this President over 
Hillary Clinton. 
But these are the types of comments 
you would expect in a Third World 
country in which military coups are a 
common occurrence, not in the United 
States of America where we honor the 
votes and choices of the American peo-
ple. 
President Zelensky and President 
Trump both said there was no pressure 
or coercion, and the call transcripts 
have been released to the public to 
prove this. 
But even if there had been pressure, 
if withholding foreign aid is an im-
peachable offense, why did Joe Biden 
threaten to do it? 
As I have stated repeatedly, if the 
bar of high crimes and misdemeanors 
has been brought down so low to in-
clude President Donald Trump’s so- 
called abuse of power, then Joe Biden 
should be charged for his actions in 
Ukraine. Instead, he gets a pass. 
This impeachment trial is simply a 
farce. But it is an expensive and time 
wasting one foisted on the American 
people by those who do not have our 
country’s best interests at heart. 
Even the Speaker of the House, who 
is a Democrat, said, if there is going to 
be an impeachment trial, if there is 
going to be impeachment proceedings, 
it should be bipartisan, it would have 
to be bipartisan. 
Mr. Speaker, the only thing bipar-
tisan about this sham is the opposition 
to it. Democrats joined every Repub-
lican to vote against it in the House. I 
expect we are going to see similar re-
sults in the Senate, a bipartisan oppo-
sition to this partisan sham. 
I look forward to the Senate bringing 
this farce to a speedy conclusion. 
f 
END THE USE OF TOXIC MILITARY 
BURN PITS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to address one of the most pressing 
health threats facing veterans across 
this Nation: exposure to burn pits. 
Burn pits are literal pits, sometimes 
10 acres large, used by the military to 
burn trash, medical waste, jet fuel, bat-
teries, even human waste. As you 
might 
imagine, 
this 
creates 
large 
plumes of toxic black smoke, which 
can have terrible health effects for 
anyone exposed. 
Our servicemembers and veterans 
who were exposed to burn pits are de-
veloping 
severe, 
debilitating 
pul-
monary diseases like pulmonary fibro-
sis and constricted bronchiolitis, leav-
ing them oxygen dependent. And young 
veterans are dying from rare cancers of 
the brain, pancreas, blood cells, and 
other organs. 
This means that many of our service-
members survived the battlefield but 
only become delayed casualties of war 
at home, dying due to lung and pul-
monary illnesses, from cancers, from 
autoimmune diseases from their burn 
pit exposures. 
If we don’t act now, they will be re-
signed to the same fate as our Vietnam 
veterans exposed to Agent Orange, who 
waited up to 30 years to get the help 
they needed. For many, it was too late. 
Our veterans cannot wait. It is my 
objective to end the use of toxic mili-
tary burn pits once and for all and give 
servicemembers and veterans the care 
they need. That is why, today, I urge a 
vote on two bills that would go a long 
way to address this critically impor-
tant issue: 
H.R. 4574, the Veterans’ Right to 
Breathe Act, which would establish 
presumption of service-connected expo-
sure to burn pits for nine evidence- 
based pulmonary diseases, including 
chronic bronchiolitis and others; and 
H.R. 4137, the Jennifer Kepner HOPE 
Act, which would make veterans ex-
posed to burn pits eligible for low-cost 
healthcare through the Priority Group 
6 under the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration. 
b 1015 
These bills are part of the com-
prehensive plan to end the use of burn 
pits, educate physicians and veterans 
on their health effects, get veterans 
and servicemembers exposed to burn 
pits the healthcare and benefits they 
need, and continue research to fully 
understand the health impacts posed 
by burn pits. 
We cannot let burn pit exposure be-
come this generation’s Agent Orange. 
We must act now for veterans and for 
their families. 
CBP DIRECTIVE FALLS SHORT 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
because children and families in CBP 
custody continue to be without basic 
humanitarian standards of care. 
Late last year, Customs and Border 
Protection put out a directive out-
lining its ‘‘enhanced medical support 
efforts,’’ with the objective of miti-
gating risks for people in CPB custody 
along the southwest border. But their 
directive for addressing medical needs 
falls short of even basic humane treat-
ment to prevent the heartbreaking 
conditions I saw when I visited the 
southern border: people piled on top of 
each other in cold, windowless, con-
crete rooms, crowded with so many 
bodies you couldn’t even see the floor; 
open toilets in crowded cells; and visi-
bly sick children coughing on one an-
other. 
The conditions I witnessed were in-
humane and inconsistent with our 
American values and our moral con-
science, and the CBP directive does 
nothing to address them. 
The directive does not include, for 
example, pregnant women, the elderly, 
or disabled individuals as vulnerable 
populations who need priority screen-
ing. The CBP medical directive does 
not address humanitarian standards for 
water, sanitation, hygiene, shelter, or 
food and nutrition, nor does it even set 
standards for private, safe, clean, and 
reliable toilets with proper waste dis-
posal. 
Last year, I wrote the House-passed 
H.R. 3239, the Humanitarian Standards 
for Individuals in CBP Custody Act. 
This bill sets basic public health stand-
ards for people in CBP’s care, such as 
health screening priorities, nutrition, 
food standards, water, sanitation, hy-
giene, and reporting requirements. It 
makes sure individuals have essentials, 
such as toothbrushes, diapers, and baby 
formula. 
Because this bipartisan bill was 
blocked from consideration in the Sen-
ate, these standards of care for chil-
dren and families are not currently 
law, and the recent CBP medical direc-
tive falls short. It fails to outline prop-
er humanitarian standards of care. 
This is why the Senate must take up 
and pass the bipartisan bill, the Hu-
manitarian Standards for Individuals 
in CBP Custody Act, to ensure CBP’s 
treatment of children and families is 
consistent with our American values 
and the principles of basic human dig-
nity and prevent children from dying 
under the custody and responsibility of 
CBP.

CELEBRATING HICKORY’S 150TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 150th 
anniversary of Hickory, North Caro-
lina. 
In 1870, Adolphus Shuford founded 
Hickory Tavern, which would later be-
come the city of Hickory. Originally, it

featured seven businesses, seven manu-
facturing plants, and had a population 
of 330 people. 
In the 1800s, Hickory was a primary 
trading center along the Western North 
Carolina Railroad, and it grew into one 
of the largest hubs for business manu-
facturing and textiles in the Southeast 
United States. 
Today, Hickory is home to more than 
40,000 people. It holds data centers op-
erated by the world’s largest tech-
nology companies, and over 40 percent 
of the world’s fiber optic cable is manu-
factured there. 
Hickory’s history goes even beyond 
its industrial roots. Some other note-
worthy 
features 
are: 
the 
Hickory 
Motor Speedway, one of the most leg-
endary short tracks in the history of 
American stock car racing; the local 
community college, Catawba Valley 
Community College, which is providing 
some of the most excellent education 
offered anywhere in the country to the 
citizens of the area; Lenoir-Rhyne Uni-
versity, one of North Carolina’s pre-
mier schools, which was founded in 
1891; a wonderful art center; and a 
Minor League Baseball team, the Hick-
ory Crawdads, which was founded 25 
years ago. 
While the city continues to grow, its 
historical landmarks still stand as a 
testament to its rich history. From the 
Propst House to Maple Grove, Union 
Square to the Henry River Mill Village, 
Hickory’s legacy as a leader in textiles 
manufacturing and trading is ever- 
present. 
Hickory has played a pivotal role in 
North Carolina’s history, and it con-
tinues to make a sizeable impact on 
North Carolina’s economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent 
Hickory, North Carolina, and I am cer-
tain it will continue to prosper and cel-
ebrate many more significant mile-
stones in the future. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL NEEDS 
WITNESSES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the im-
peachment of President Donald Trump 
has forced our Nation into a constitu-
tional crisis. 
On the one hand, Democrats have led 
a good faith effort to discover the truth 
and hold President Trump and his ad-
ministration responsible for their de-
structive 
and 
corrupt 
actions 
in 
Ukraine. While on the other hand, Re-
publicans have refused outright to 
meaningfully engage in the fact-find-
ing process. 
In our House, Republicans have ig-
nored the fact that Russia has invaded 
Ukraine, a sovereign nation. Ukraine is 
a scrimmage line for liberty in Europe 
today, a continent whose liberty we re-
stored and paid a deep price for it. 
Despite overwhelming evidence in 
the Senate, Republicans have com-
plained they have learned nothing new 
from the impeachment trial. Yet, they 
have voted over 10 times to block new 
evidence and witnesses. 
For instance, it is clear that Presi-
dent Trump’s former National Security 
Advisor John Bolton’s testimony has 
relevance to the Senate’s efforts to find 
the truth—the truth. Bolton has first-
hand knowledge of the administra-
tion’s duplicitous actions in Ukraine 
and President Trump’s malintent. Yet, 
Republicans in the Senate have refused 
to subpoena Bolton, despite his state-
ment that he is willing to testify. 
Additionally, this week, The New 
York Times reported that President 
Trump told his former National Secu-
rity Advisor John Bolton that he want-
ed the $391 million in security assist-
ance to Ukraine frozen—a nation at 
war—until Ukrainian officials agreed 
to carry out investigations into Demo-
crats and the Bidens. 
According to a manuscript written 
by Bolton, such a claim is relevant and 
warrants immediate investigation by 
Congress. Yet, Politico reported today 
that Republican leadership in the Sen-
ate remains opposed to additional wit-
nesses, including Bolton, though dis-
sent is emerging in their ranks. 
Mr. Speaker, I feel strongly that if 
the Senate fails to allow additional 
witnesses relevant to the impeachment 
trial and subsequently votes to acquit, 
such inaction will set a dangerous and 
perhaps even irreversible precedent, 
one that allows the executive branch to 
ignore congressional oversight with 
impunity. 
Today, President Trump has refused 
to comply with any congressional sub-
poenas obstructing justice, even going 
a step further as to block any and in-
timidate 
executive 
branch 
officials 
from cooperating with the House inves-
tigation. 
An executive branch unaccountable 
to Congress, the branch of government 
most connected with the American 
people, is a dangerous prospect. We 
cannot allow this to become the new 
norm. 
Ours is a nation of laws, not men or 
women. Laws protect us. The balance 
of power between our three branches of 
government at the local, State, and 
Federal levels is the only protection we 
have from ourselves. 
Our Founders wrote into our Con-
stitution the means to hold a lawless 
President accountable and remove him 
from office. The rule of law is sacred, 
and that is why no one is above the 
law. 
Regardless of anyone’s opinions of 
President Trump, personal affections 
are not the issue. The issue at hand is 
independent of party or politics. The 
question is: Who among us will sit si-
lent and allow the voice of the people 
to be trampled, and who will rise up to 
keep the Presidency accountable to our 
Republic? 
Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege 
to serve alongside public servants in 
both parties. While I have had disagree-
ments with Republican colleagues on 
policy, I remain immensely thankful 
for their bipartisanship in so many 
ways and willingness to engage on 
issues to strengthen our Nation’s na-
tional security and improve the lives of 
working people, calling many Repub-
licans, actually, my friends. 
But that is why, Mr. Speaker, I am so 
disappointed today. My Republican col-
leagues have so far failed to act in de-
fense of our democracy. They seem to 
live in an alternate reality from our 
own. 
The American people have made it 
clear they want additional witnesses to 
ensure a fair trial. They want to hear 
what Ambassador Bolton and other 
witnesses have to say. Senate Repub-
licans should let them testify under 
oath. 
Finally, I enter into the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD the words of Dr. Daniel 
Rapport, a constituent and a distin-
guished medical doctor at the Univer-
sity of Toledo Medical Center, urging 
the 
Senate 
to 
convict 
President 
Trump. 
His words: ‘‘The impeachment of 
President Trump has forced our Nation 
into a constitutional crisis. If the Sen-
ate fails to hold President Trump ac-
countable, as is its constitutional duty, 
then a dangerous precedent will be set, 
one 
that 
empowers 
the 
executive 
branch to ignore congressional over-
sight with impunity. 
‘‘Combined with the increasing power 
of the executive in recent decades, in 
addition to the President’s veto power, 
the capacity of the legislative branch 
to rein in the executive will be ever 
more limited, weakening the Ameri-
can’s people will in their own govern-
ment. 
‘‘This is an outcome that must be 
avoided at all costs. The Senate alone 
has the power to do what is right to 
preserve the balance of power between 
the legislative and executive branches. 
The Senate must vote to convict Presi-
dent Trump.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

PAIN IS THE PRICE OF AMERICA’S 
HEALTHCARE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, the $3 
trillion healthcare industry continues 
to crush the middle class. Americans 
are paying more than ever and getting 
ever less as they struggle to access 
care. The cost of care for both workers 
and 
employers 
is 
outpacing 
wage 
growth. 
What drives the cost of care in Amer-
ica today is lack of transparency, con-
solidation, and overregulation that is 
leading to administrative glut. The 
time is now to confront these cost driv-
ers. President Trump has addressed 
these exact issues in recent months.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H643 
January 29, 2020 
Obtaining coverage has allayed the 
fears as costs rise, yet coverage itself 
keeps costs hidden and high. Our 
opaque, third-party payment system 
has obscured the true cost of receiving 
care from patients and physicians 
alike. 
Prices are rising with no end in sight. 
We see examples of it every day, people 
who believe they are covered because 
they have insurance only to find out 
that, in some cases, they are just as 
vulnerable as those who are uninsured. 
The current system allows people who 
have insurance to end up paying more 
for a CT, for example, than if they had 
just paid cash. 
This process and complexity of bill-
ing can allow this to happen. This lack 
of transparency in our healthcare sys-
tem is a culprit, and it harms patients, 
physicians, pharmacists, and others 
who rely on it. 
Consolidated hospital systems, the 
completely 
unregulated 
pharma-
ceutical middlemen, PBMs, and the in-
surance companies that are tied to 
both hospitals and PBMs have been in-
creasingly profiting. These corporate 
giants have no motivation to offer 
transparency and discounts. 
Costs 
remain 
deliberately 
hidden 
until the patient receives a bill. The 
number of healthcare administrators 
has grown more than 4,000 percent be-
tween 1970 and 2020. Consequently, 
spending on healthcare has increased 
3,200 percent. 
Is there any other conclusion than to 
tie rising costs to administrative glut? 
No. Administrative glut is largely to 
manage the regulations that our gov-
ernment has put in place, regulations 
that make healthcare more complex 
than the tax code. It is past time to cut 
the glut. 
Medicine’s malignant mergers, both 
vertical and horizontal, are creating 
behemoth 
healthcare 
systems 
like 
CVS, where insurance companies, PBM, 
pharmacy, and drive-by clinics are all 
together. This leads to patients being 
forced to go somewhere to receive their 
drugs and, in some cases, are told that 
they have to purchase brand-name 
drugs even when the generic equivalent 
is available. It is not about what is a 
better deal for the patient but what is 
a better deal for the PBMs and their 
ilk. 
Americans are paying more than ever 
for coverage that limits their choices 
and doesn’t always provide them access 
to care. The bloated bureaucratic spe-
cial interests must be unveiled and 
Americans must educate themselves on 
cost drivers to forge sustainable solu-
tions. 
We need to focus on returning to a 
patient-centered 
healthcare 
system. 
Some people are starting to do this 
with things like direct primary care, 
which provides the patient with an 
array of services for a fixed cost that is 
actually transparent. 
b 1030 
We need a system that allows pa-
tients to choose and fosters competi-
tion. The only way we are going to get 
a system like that is by shining a light 
on the shadows of our healthcare sys-
tem. The answer is not more govern-
ment, not more regulation but, rather, 
a concerted effort by Congress to bring 
our healthcare system out into the 
sunshine and to allow our sunshine to 
shine on these hidden practices; these 
practices are actually causing our 
prices to go up. No longer can we allow 
patients to bear the brunt of this com-
plicated and very, very complex sys-
tem. 
The 
time 
is 
now 
to 
follow 
healthcare’s money trail, unwind exist-
ing laws, or enact new laws that de-
mand cost transparency, cut adminis-
trative glut, stop consolidation, and 
bring regulatory relief. Your health de-
pends on it.

CONGRATULATING THE CAMP 
HILL LIONS GIRLS SOCCER TEAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratula-
tions to the Camp Hill Lions Girls Soc-
cer Team for their victory at the PIAA 
Class A State Soccer Championship, 
and for their excellence throughout 
their undefeated 2019 season. 
Led by Coach Jared Latchford—who, 
to no one’s surprise, was just named 
the Pennsylvania Soccer Coaches Asso-
ciation Girls Class A Coach of the 
Year—the Lions dominated the season, 
achieving a stunning overall record of 
25 wins, zero ties, and zero losses. 
This is the Lions’ second appearance 
at the state championship in the last 3 
years. They took an early lead in their 
contest against Shady Side Academy 
and held it throughout the game. 
Aggressive and selfless offense, vigi-
lant defense, and stellar goalkeeping 
earned the Lions a 2–0 victory and 
their first State championship trophy 
in school history. 
These amazing athletes are the epit-
ome of remarkable dedication and dis-
cipline, outstanding skill, exceptional 
sportsmanship, and an unyielding team 
spirit. Their dedication to excellence, 
to say the least, earned them this 
championship. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 10th Con-
gressional District, I congratulate the 
Camp Hill Lions for their incredible 
performance. We are proud of you.

HONORING THE LEADERSHIP AND 
CAREER 
OF 
SERGEANT 
JOHN 
AITON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the exemplary lead-
ership and career of Sergeant John 
Aiton, a native of the Palmetto State, 
born and raised in my hometown of 
Rock Hill, South Carolina. 
Upon graduating from Rock Hill High 
School, John Aiton attended East 
Coast Bible College, where he received 
a bachelor of arts in pastoral min-
istries, later earning a master’s degree 
in biblical interpretation from Pente-
costal Theological Seminary. 
After a brief teaching and coaching 
stint at the Heritage Academy in Fort 
Mill, Sergeant Aiton joined the Rock 
Hill Police Department. John always 
had a special place in his heart for 
helping the community, so after 2 
years of patrol work, he left to join the 
juvenile division as a DARE instructor. 
During his work early on, he was pro-
moted to special investigator, and was 
selected to serve on the police force’s 
first crisis negotiating team, forming 
the department’s neighborhood watch 
program. 
Because of his dedication to the local 
community, he began to serve as the 
department’s chaplain and continued 
work with the Worthy Boys and Girls 
Camp. This ultimately led him to his 
best-known role, a school resource offi-
cer for 22 years; 11 years at North-
western High School, followed by an-
other 11 years at South Pointe High 
School. 
Throughout his distinguished career, 
Sergeant Aiton went above and beyond 
his job to protect and serve the com-
munity. Due to his service, he was pro-
moted to sergeant of the Community 
Service Division, but because of his 
commitment to student safety, he re-
lieved himself of those duties. 
John is a truly inspirational citizen 
and a community servant whose pride 
and joy is found in protecting students. 
After a distinguished career, Ser-
geant John Aiton retired from the 
force in June of 2019. It is truly an 
honor to recognize and congratulate 
Sergeant John Aiton on his well-de-
served retirement. Rock Hill could not 
have asked for a better, selfless role 
model for our community. 
In the words of Winston Churchill, 
who made famous a quote when Great 
Britain was about to be under siege, he 
said: 
There will be a time when doing your best 
is not good enough. You must do what is re-
quired. 
Sergeant Aiton did what was re-
quired to make a true difference.

January 29, 2020 
PRAYER 
Rabbi Avraham Hakohen ‘‘Romi’’ 
Cohn, Congregation Ohr Yechezkel, 
Brooklyn, New York, offered the fol-
lowing prayer: 
Almighty, open my lips. May the 
words of my mouth declare Your 
praise. With profound humility and 
deep appreciation, I stand before You. 
As a young boy of 13 years, I was con-
demned to be dead, to be murdered 
along with my entire family, including 
my 3-year-old little sister, by one evil 
man, may his name be erased forever. 
But my life was spared. I was saved by 
my Father, by You, O Lord, the Father 
of the Universe, who brought me to the 
shores of this beautiful country, the 
United States of America, the land of 
the free, where I found a safe and new 
home. 
As I stand before you on the 75th an-
niversary of the liberation of the 
Auschwitz death camp, I offer humble 
words of praise and gratitude to the Al-
mighty. Blessed are You, King of the 
Universe, who has granted me life and 
sustenance to this day. Amen. 
May You, Lord, accept with mercy 
our prayers for our country; for our 
President, Donald Trump; our Vice 
President, MICHAEL
PENCE; my Con-
gressman, MAX ROSE; and all his noble 
colleagues. 
O Mighty King of the Universe, as 
Your humble servant, I bestow this 
blessing upon Your children. May the 
Lord bless you and protect you. Amen. 
May the Lord deal kindly and gra-
ciously with you. Amen. 
May the Lord bestow His favor upon 
you and grant you peace.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
LOUDERMILK) come forward and lead 
the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK led the Pledge of 
Allegiance as follows:

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
WELCOMING RABBI AVRAHAM 
HAKOHEN ‘‘ROMI’’ COHN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ROSE) is recognized for 1 
minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Rabbi Romi 
Cohn, a leader on Staten Island and a 
dear, dear friend. 
Rabbi Cohn has dedicated his life to 
Jewish culture and heritage and built a 
renowned career as a mohel in New 
York City for over 25 years. I am espe-
cially honored to welcome Rabbi Cohn 
this week as we remember the 75th an-
niversary of the liberation of Ausch-
witz. 
Rabbi Cohn’s career is merely a con-
tinuation of a lifetime of fighting for 
the Jewish faith. His early life was up-
rooted by the rise of the Nazi Party, 
their invasion of Czechoslovakia, and 
the outbreak of World War II. Under 
Nazi rule, he saw the Hitler Youth at-
tack his father in the street. 
When war broke out, he joined the 
partisans fighting Nazi tyranny. At 15 
years old, Romi was the youngest 
member of the Czechoslovakian par-
tisan forces. Among other feats, he 
helped save 56 Jewish families escape 
the horrors of the Holocaust. 
He fought with the partisans until 
the end of the war and then went in 
search of his own family. Of his parents 
and six siblings, only his father and 
two sisters had survived. 
Rabbi Cohn saw how a democracy can 
be corrupted into a fascist dictatorship 
and what happens when anti-Semitism 
is allowed to fester. 
Sadly, across this country, we see an 
alarming rise in anti-Semitism and ha-
tred. Rabbi Cohn’s legacy reminds us 
never to accept bigotry, not when we 
see it in the street, not when we saw it 
in the Halls of Congress, not when we 
see it anywhere. Our freedoms are not 
free. We must fight for them or risk 
losing them. 
Rabbi Cohn is a model and example 
for all of us to follow, and I thank him 
for his extraordinary life of service. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 further re-
quests for 1-minute speeches on each 
side of the aisle. 
f 
SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE 
CREDIT ACT 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the Comprehensive 
CREDIT Act, which we will be consid-
ering very soon. It will help bring 
much-needed accountability to credit 
reporting agencies and protect con-
sumers from fraud and abusive lending. 
Far too often, I hear of Rhode Island-
ers who have suffered as a result of 
credit reports with inaccurate or ad-
verse information. The impacts are se-
rious. They can prevent an individual 
from getting a job, taking out a mort-
gage, or acquiring student loans that 
they need to go to college. Yet, when 
they need to dispute an error, credit re-
porting agencies make it near impos-
sible. 
Mr. Speaker, the system is broken, 
and the Comprehensive CREDIT Act 
will provide long-overdue reforms to 
address these systemic issues. This bill 
will ensure Americans have the infor-
mation they need to protect them-
selves from fraud; opportunities and a 
mechanism to dispute any errors, and 
to get them fixed; and protection from 
predatory lenders. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
this bill, and I thank Congresswoman 
PRESSLEY and Chairwoman WATERS for 
bringing it to the floor later today. 
f 
RECOGNIZING STUART MACVEAN 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I am grateful to recognize 
Stuart MacVean of Aiken, president 
and CEO of Savannah River Nuclear 
Solutions, for being honored as a 2020 
CEO Who ‘‘Gets It’’ by the National 
Safety Council’s Safety and Health 
magazine. 
This award is presented to those who 
go the extra mile through risk reduc-
tion, performance measurement, safety 
management solutions, and employee 
engagement—safety first. 
Stuart has made keeping his employ-
ees safe and healthy a top priority. His 
dedication has resulted in successful 
site mission operations for support of 
our Nation’s nuclear complex. 
Stuart has been recognized by his 
local community. This month, I was 
present when Stuart was named Man of 
the Year for his leadership, community 
impact and involvement, and integrity 
by the Aiken Chamber of Commerce, 
led by President David Jameson and 
Chair Julie Whitesell, succeeding Pas-
tor Paul Bush. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism 
with the leadership of President Don-
ald Trump.

PRAISING DONARI JOY MOSBY 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the kindness and 
generosity of a rising star in my dis-
trict, Donari Joy Mosby. Ms. Mosby is 
a senior at County Prep High School in 
Jersey City, New Jersey. 
Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, she made it 
her goal to select socks to help the 
homeless residents stay warm during 
the winter. She started with a modest 
goal of 250 pairs of socks. When she ex-
ceeded that, she raised the number 
every single year. 
This year, she donated more than 
5,700 pairs of socks to a local commu-
nity center on Dr. Martin Luther King 
Drive in Jersey City.

In 7 years, Ms. Mosby has donated 
21,883 pairs of socks to help the home-
less of my district. She called her cam-
paign the Joy of Sox and wrote that 
socks are a simple and powerful way to 
show love to someone going through 
difficult times. 
I agree, and I think her efforts and 
commitment to charity deserve to be

f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SCHOOL 
CHOICE WEEK 
(Mr. LOUDERMILK asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of National 
School Choice Week and the powerful 
impact that putting education choice 
in the hands of families can have in the 
lives of students, both in Georgia and 
across America. 
Every child is a special gift from 
God, unique in their learning styles 
and capabilities. When it comes to 
their education, the options available 
to students and their families should 
not be limited by mandates from Wash-
ington, D.C. 
It is also an unfortunate reality that 
opportunities for a quality education 
are not the same in every ZIP Code. 
Parents should have flexibility when 
choosing the best school setting to fit 
the specific needs of their children. 
Whether it be through traditional 
public schools, charter schools, private 
schools, homeschooling, or vouchers, 
the decision about where to go to 
school should be made as close to the 
student as possible. 
When we empower families to choose 
the educational options best suited for 
their sons and daughters, we give them 
the opportunity to thrive and to be-
come the next generation of leaders in 
their families, churches, and commu-
nities. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to lend my 
voice in support of school choice, espe-
cially during National School Choice 
Week. 
f 
HONORING EULOGIO ACEVEDO 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor Eulogio Acevedo, who passed 
away earlier this month. 
Those of us who knew Mr. Acevedo 
will remember him as a dedicated fam-
ily man, a leader in the business com-
munity, and a relentless champion for 
social justice. Born in the Dominican 
Republic, Mr. Acevedo made his home 
in Providence, Rhode Island, along 
with his beloved wife of 30 years, 
Maryelyn. 
Mr. Acevedo lived the American 
Dream. An engineer by trade, he owned 
and operated his own construction 
company for more than two decades. 
He raised five children and lived to cel-
ebrate the births of four grandchildren. 
Most important of all, Mr. Acevedo 
gave back to the country that gave 
him so much. He was an active commu-
nity leader in Providence and a polit-
ical legend, a gentle but strong man 
who helped anyone in need. 
Mr. Speaker, I am thankful that I 
had the opportunity to know this great 
man. He was a dear friend to me. Our 
city and our State will miss him deep-
ly. May he rest in peace. 
f 
MARKING ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
‘‘CHALLENGER’’ TRAGEDY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday marked the an-
niversary of the Challenger space shut-
tle explosion. 
Mr. Speaker, 34 years ago, President 
Ronald Reagan addressed the Nation 
from the Oval Office, mourning with 
the entire country but paying special 
attention to the Nation’s young people, 
telling them: ‘‘The future doesn’t be-
long to the fainthearted; it belongs to 
the brave.’’ 
Today, those young people have be-
come the men and women who have 
taken up the mantle of space explo-
ration, who probe the outer limits of 
our solar system and even join NASA 
to explore space for themselves. Presi-
dent Reagan’s words are as true for 
these men and women as they were for 
the Challenger crew. 
As we look back on the tragedy of 
the Challenger, we must also look 
ahead. Let us recommit ourselves to 
space exploration by empowering the 
men and women who study it. We can 
honor our past by making space explo-
ration a part of our future.

IT IS TIME TO END MIGRANT 
PROTECTION PROTOCOLS 
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, today 
marks the 1-year anniversary of the 
implementation of the abhorrent Mi-
grant Protection Protocol program, or 
MPP, which forces vulnerable asylum 
seekers to remain in Mexico for their 
U.S. court dates. 
MPP is currently implemented at 
seven ports of entry along the U.S.- 
Mexico border, including in my com-
munity, El Paso, Texas, where over 
18,000 asylum seekers have been made 
to wait in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. 
During my time in Congress, I have 
brought a number of my colleagues to 
the border to see our Nation’s immi-
gration challenges firsthand. A number 
of them joined me last July, when we 
crossed the border to visit with some of 
the families impacted by the program. 
We heard about their journey to the 
U.S., the dangers they face if they re-
turn home, and what it takes to sur-
vive day-to-day in Mexico, a country 
that is not their own. We heard that 
obtaining legal counsel is nearly im-
possible, hindering due process. 
This administration is making it as 
hard as possible for these families to 
obtain asylum in an effort to deter 
them from coming to the U.S. in the 
first place, because cruelty is the 
point. 
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor 
H.R. 2662, the Asylum Seeker Protec-
tion Act, to defund this unlawful, ab-
horrent program. 
f 
TWO DEFINITIONS OF 
PRODUCTIVITY 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, there are 
different definitions of productivity at 
the two ends of Pennsylvania Avenue 
at this point in time. 
Here at the Capitol, Democrat leader-
ship seems to confuse activity with ac-
complishment, spending years—years— 
trying to impeach and remove a duly- 
elected President. 
At the White House, just this week, 
President Trump delivered two major 
accomplishments, a Middle East peace 
plan and the signing of the USMCA. 
The 
President’s 
two-State 
peace 
agreement with Israeli leadership pro-
tects Israel’s security and ensures Pal-
estine has a prosperous future as long 
as it too seeks peace. It is the product 
of compromise and is a promising solu-
tion for a long-unstable region. 
The 
USMCA, 
just 
signed 
earlier 
today, opens new markets for Amer-
ican goods, levels the playing field for 
North American trade, and creates jobs 
nationwide. It is great for our country 
and it is great for Pennsylvania. 
As was stated very well earlier this 
week: ‘‘Imagine if all the energy from 
this impeachment was used to solve 
the problems of the American people.’’

January 29, 2020 
Abigail recognized the need for a tool 
to increase the efficacy, organization, 
and participation in efforts to solve our 
climate crisis locally, due to her in-
volvement in sustainability and envi-

South Seattle.

BE LIKE AMERICA, DON’T BE LIKE 
SAUDI ARABIA 
(Mr. TED LIEU of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. 
Speaker, this morning, Donald Trump 
wrote on Twitter: ‘‘Remember Repub-
licans, the Democrats already had 17 
witnesses. We were given none. Wit-
nesses are up to the House, not up to 
the Senate.’’ 
Both of his statements are false. In 
the House, there were multiple Repub-
lican-requested witnesses that testified 
under oath, some of them on national 
TV, and they were cross-examined by 
both Democrat and Republican com-
mittee members. 
In addition, under our Constitution, 
it is the Senate that runs trials. And 
Americans understand that in a trial 
you have witnesses and documents. In 
fact, a recent poll showed that 75 per-
cent of Americans want the U.S. Sen-
ate to call in witnesses, witnesses like 
John Bolton. 
You know who runs trials without 
witnesses? Saudi Arabia. 
So my message to the U.S. Senate, 
controlled by Republicans, is very sim-
ple: Be like America. Don’t be like 
Saudi Arabia.

RECOGNIZING 100TH ANNIVERSARY

RATIFICATION

19TH 
AMENDMENT AND 200TH BIRTH-
DAY OF SUSAN B. ANTHONY 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, in addi-
tion to marking the 100th anniversary 
of the ratification of the 19th Amend-
ment, this year also marks the 200th 
birthday of Susan B. Anthony, a pio-
neer of the women’s rights movement 
who made her home in my district in 
Rochester, New York. 
As a Nation, we have come so far in 
the fight for equality, but we continue 
to face new barriers that threaten to 
roll back the progress we have made. 
That is why at next week’s State of the 
Union Address, I am so proud that I 
will be joined by Deborah Hughes, 
president and CEO of the National 
Susan B. Anthony House & Museum in 
Rochester, and a passionate advocate 
for women everywhere. 
Deborah’s work reminds us that the 
words of Susan B. Anthony still ring 
true today; we must ‘‘organize, agitate, 
educate’’ until every American has full 
equality. 
I am so grateful that Deborah will be 
joining me next week, and I will con-
tinue to stand alongside her and work 
together 
to 
support 
and 
empower 
women everywhere.

IMPROVE AND STRENGTHEN 
SOCIAL SECURITY 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, 80 years ago this week, Amer-
icans began receiving Social Security 
benefits. Social Security is a highly 
popular and successful program with a 
trust fund exceeding $1.9 trillion. 
With rising life expectancy since the 
program’s inception, adjustments need 
to be made to improve and strengthen 
Social Security for future generations. 
The Social Security 2100 Act, spon-
sored by Congressman JOHN LARSON of 
Connecticut, will increase benefits for 
all current and future beneficiaries; 
will improve cost-of-living-adjustments 
to keep up with real inflation; will cut 
taxes for millions of beneficiaries; and 
improve and strengthen Social Secu-
rity through the 21st century and be-
yond. 
I urge passage of the Social Security 
2100 Act.

minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of families in my dis-
trict who are experiencing deep eco-
nomic uncertainty. 
A report issued late last year high-
lighted that hardworking families in 
my district, especially those with chil-
dren, are struggling with rising costs 
and stagnant wages. The report is 
called ‘‘Underwater’’ because even as 
Wall Street rides high, American fami-
lies are struggling to stay afloat. In 
fact, people and small businesses in my 
district are suffering as a result of this 
administration’s economic policies, its 
trade wars, and corporate giveaways. 
At year end, a typical working fam-
ily earning $70,000 a year is likely to be 
over $2,000 in debt after paying for 
childcare, housing, and healthcare, and 
that is before they start saving for col-
lege or retirement. 
Forty percent of the families in my 
district make less than that. For these 
families, the American Dream of pro-
viding a better life for their children 
slips further from their grasp every 
day. 
Instead of corporate welfare, our eco-
nomic policies must support working, 
middle-class families in order to create 
healthier and more prosperous commu-
nities for everyone. 
RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
PETER VOLKMANN 
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Chatham Police 
Chief Peter Volkmann, my guest for 
the State of the Union Address. Chief 
Volkmann has been a pioneer in ad-
dressing the opioid epidemic in upstate 
New York and founded the highly suc-
cessful Chatham Cares 4 U program. 
Chatham Cares 4 U encourages resi-
dents struggling with the disease that 
is addiction to walk into the police sta-
tion, turn over their drugs, and ask for 
help. Instead of being charged, individ-
uals are placed into a treatment pro-
gram, regardless of financial means or 
their insurance coverage. 
This highly-successful initiative has 
been modeled throughout our region, 
and 
I 
was 
proud 
to 
have 
Chief 
Volkmann share his success with our 
community at my opioid epidemic 
panel last year. 
Our work to address this urgent pri-
ority is ongoing and will require both 
the attention and continued coopera-
tion of all levels of government, law 
enforcement, and our first responders. 
In that vein, I hope to hear from the 
President on Tuesday that he is com-
mitted to bipartisan, comprehensive 
solutions to address the opioid crisis in 
upstate New York and all across this 
country.

NATIONAL CATHOLIC SCHOOLS 
WEEK 
(Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, this is 
National Catholic Schools Week. Every 
year, I introduce a resolution to recog-
nize 
the 
outstanding 
contributions 
that Catholic schools make to our Na-
tion. 
My 
own 
education 
at 
Saint 
Symphorosa and Saint Ignatius pro-
vided the foundation that enabled me 
to earn 2 degrees in engineering, and a 
Ph.D. in political science before I 
began my career as a teacher. My expe-
rience, my wife’s experience, and the 
experience of so many others across 
our Nation have made me a lifelong 
supporter of Catholic schools. 
This year’s Catholic Schools Week 
theme is ‘‘Learn. Serve. Lead. Suc-
ceed.’’ And that is exactly what Catho-
lic schools teach students to do. 
Earlier this week, I visited Saint 
Christina in Chicago and Saint Albert 
the Great in Burbank, and later this 
week I will be at Saints Cyril & 
Methodius in Lemont, as well as Saint 
Richard and Saint Daniel in Chicago. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
take time this week to recognize the 
great work of the Catholic schools in 
their districts.

tential, or potential accepted medical use, as 
schedule I controlled substances when sched-
uled as a class; and 
(C) any known classification of fentanyl- 
related substances with no, or low, abuse po-
tential, or potential accepted medical use, as 
schedule I controlled substances that has re-
sulted from the scheduling action of the 
Drug 
Enforcement 
Administration 
that 
added paragraph (h)(30) to section 1308.11 of 
title 21, Code of Federal Regulations; 
(2) review the impact or potential impact 
of controls on fentanyl-related substances on 
public health and safety, including on—

(E) evaluating the degree, if any, to which 
establishing processes to obtain or modify a 
Federal authorization to conduct research 
with a fentanyl-related substance that are 
separate from the applicable processes for 
other schedule I controlled substances could 
exacerbate burdens or lead to confusion 
among persons seeking to research fentanyl- 
related substances or other schedule I con-
trolled substances. 
(d) INPUT FROM CERTAIN FEDERAL AGEN-
CIES.—In conducting the study and devel-
oping the report under subsection (b), the

form communities. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER) and the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Hampshire. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
materials on S. 3201. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Hampshire? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we, as a Congress, have 
worked over the past several years to 
combat the opioid epidemic and sup-
port the millions of Americans with a 
substance use disorder. That work in-
cludes bipartisan passage of legislation 
like the 21st Century Cures Act, the 
Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-
ery Act, and the SUPPORT for Pa-
tients and Communities Act. 
In 2017 and 2018, we appropriated 
nearly $11 billion for a total of 57 Fed-
eral programs that fund efforts to curb 
this epidemic. These programs span the 
continuum of care, including preven-
tion, treatment, and long-term recov-
ery. 
The funding also spans across agen-
cies, directing investments toward re-
search, public health surveillance, and 
supply 
reduction 
efforts. 
Most 
re-
cently, in the fiscal year 2020 funding 
bill, we included over $4 billion in pub-
lic health dollars to help with preven-
tion and treatment. 
In December, the House passed H.R. 
3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug 
Costs Now Act, which included an addi-
tional $10 billion in funding to support 
public health efforts to combat the 
opioid epidemic. 
On the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, we have had the chance to hear 
directly from States that our work at 
the Federal level has helped save lives. 
Last year, in my State of New Hamp-
shire, a total of 284 deaths were attrib-
uted to drug overdoses, of which 82 per-
cent, 234 deaths, involved the use of 
fentanyl. This is an alarming statistic 
and the frightening reality of opioid 
addiction in our communities. 
It is crucial that we understand the 
significance of synthetic opioids. As we 
have seen in New Hampshire and 
around this country, though the most

January 29, 2020 
recent data has indicated overdose 
deaths have plateaued, deaths from 
synthetic opioids continue to rise. 
This is primarily fueled by illicit 
fentanyl and substances structurally 
related to fentanyl, which we com-
monly refer to as fentanyl analogues. 
These drugs are often far more power-
ful. Fentanyl, the most well-known of 
this class of drug, is approximately 50 
times more powerful than heroin and 
100 times more powerful than mor-
phine. 
b 1230 
Although it is used in legitimate 
medical settings, we have seen a pro-
liferation 
of 
illicitly 
produced 
fentanyl, fentanyl analogue, and its 
precursor chemicals originating from 
China. 
Because fentanyl is relatively easy to 
make and so potent, it is tragically 
leading to large increases in overdose 
deaths. One kilogram of fentanyl pur-
chased in China for $3,000 to $5,000 can 
generate upwards of $1.5 million in rev-
enue on the illicit market here in the 
United States. That is potentially 
enough to kill 500,000 Americans by 
overdose. 
We have all heard the terrible num-
bers that tell this story. In 2017, there 
were over 47,000 opioid overdose deaths, 
and 28,000 of those deaths involved syn-
thetic opioids such as fentanyl in the 
United States. 
A more complicating factor is that 
we are now seeing fentanyl increas-
ingly mixed into other drugs like co-
caine, methamphetamine, and even 
counterfeit 
prescription 
drugs 
like 
oxycodone. This means that many 
unsuspecting Americans are dying at 
the hands of fentanyl when they didn’t 
even realize they were taking it. 
Mr. Speaker, the nature of our Na-
tion’s fentanyl problem is far more 
complex than drug epidemics of the 
past. In addition to traditional routes, 
users can purchase fentanyl analogues 
and fentanyl precursor chemicals on-
line on the internet. These purchases, 
which typically include the most pure 
and potent fentanyl, are often pack-
aged and shipped through the United 
States Postal Service or consignment 
carriers in small quantities, making 
detection a significant challenge. 
These factors create a complex prob-
lem which requires a multifaceted so-
lution. Part of that solution is finding 
a way to support both public health 
and public safety actions aimed at 
stemming the tide of overdose deaths. 
In February 2018, the Drug Enforce-
ment Agency used its authority in the 
Controlled Substances Act to tempo-
rarily place, for 2 years, all illicit 
fentanyl-like substances in schedule I. 
With this authority expiring in just 9 
days, we must do more to understand 
the true impact of this temporary 
scheduling order, including its impact 
on public health, public safety, re-
search, and Federal criminal prosecu-
tions. 
That is why, today, we are consid-
ering S. 3201, the Temporary Reauthor-
ization and Study of the Emergency 
Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. 
This bill, which passed unanimously 
out of the Senate, would extend DEA’s 
temporary order for 15 months, while 
also tasking the Government Account-
ability Office with an evaluation of the 
temporary order. 
Placing a whole class of fentanyl-like 
substances into schedule I does not 
come without implications for criminal 
justice and research. The National In-
stitute on Drug Abuse notes that ob-
taining or modifying a schedule I reg-
istration involves significant adminis-
trative challenges, and researchers re-
port that obtaining a new registration 
can take more than a year. 
It is critical that our response bal-
ance the need for legitimate research 
access that holds potential for im-
proved treatments for pain and addic-
tion, while also prioritizing a more 
long-term solution to the dangerous 
trafficking of fentanyl analogues. 
This temporary emergency sched-
uling order also has international im-
plications. A year after the United 
States moved to schedule all fentanyl- 
related substances, China finally an-
nounced that it would act and do the 
same. This classwide control in China 
has slowed the rate of new fentanyl 
analogue encounters in the illicit mar-
ket. 
An expiration in 9 days would also 
put the DEA back in the position of 
playing 
whack-a-mole, 
scheduling 
fentanyl substances one by one while 
clandestine criminal chemists in China 
work to stay one molecule ahead of our 
efforts. 
As founder and co-chair of the Bipar-
tisan Opioid Task Force, I agree with 
many of my colleagues that we cannot 
arrest our way out of this epidemic, 
and that is why I have introduced the 
Humane Correctional Healthcare Act. 
This legislation would repeal the Med-
icaid Inmate Exclusion and allow jus-
tice-involved 
individuals 
to 
access 
quality healthcare, including mental 
health treatment and substance misuse 
services. 
The complexity of the fentanyl crisis 
and creation of other synthetic drugs 
demand a thoughtful, balanced ap-
proach that protects the public health 
and public safety of all Americans. 
This temporary extension, coupled 
with the GAO study, will give us the 
time to work on a longer term solution 
and will also give us the opportunity to 
better understand the full range of im-
plications that come with classwide 
scheduling of these substances. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.

Study of Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl 
Analogues Act, the Committee on Ways and 
Means agrees to waive formal consideration 
of the bill as to provisions that fall within

The Committee on Ways and Means takes 
this action with the mutual understanding 
that we do not waive any jurisdiction over 
the subject matter contained in this or simi-
lar legislation, and the Committee will be 
appropriately consulted and involved as the 
bill or similar legislation moves forward so 
that we may address any remaining issues 
within our jurisdiction. The Committee also 
reserves the right to seek appointment of an 
appropriate number of conferees to any 
House-Senate conference involving this or 
similar legislation. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding, 
and would ask that a copy of our exchange of 
letter on this matter be included in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration 
of S. 3201.

sulting with the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce and agreeing to waive formal con-
sideration of S. 3201, the Temporary Reau-
thorization and Study of the Emergency 
Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act, so 
that the bill may proceed expeditiously to 
the House floor. 
I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees from your committee to any 
House-Senate conference on this legislation. 
I will ensure our letters on S. 3201 are en-
tered into the Congressional Record during 
floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate 
your cooperation regarding this legislation 
and look forward to continuing to work to-
gether as this measure moves through the 
legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of S. 3201, the Temporary Re-
authorization and Study of the Emer-
gency Scheduling of Fentanyl Ana-
logues Act. This is a commonsense, bi-
partisan extension of DEA’s temporary 
scheduling 
of 
fentanyl-related 
sub-
stances. 
Mr. Speaker, fentanyl is 50 times 
more potent than heroin. Fentanyl is 
100 times more potent than morphine. 
There are also countless types of 
fentanyl analogues which are similar 
in chemical structure to fentanyl but 
can be even more potent. 
In just a 1-year period, synthetic 
opioids like fentanyl claimed more 
than 32,000 American lives. I am re-
minded of the story of Amanda Gray, a 
beautiful young lady who was going to 
college, ended up being given 100 per-
cent fentanyl, and died.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H649 
January 29, 2020 
These are evil things going on in our 
society and our culture, and this legis-
lation will help put a stop to it. To 
fight this epidemic, the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration was able to put 
in place this powerful but temporary 
tool. 
Previously, drug traffickers could 
create these new variations of fentanyl 
by changing as little as a molecule— 
just one. Then these new variations, or 
analogues, as they are known, were not 
any longer on the schedule of con-
trolled drugs. 
So what does that mean? They were 
outside of the control of law enforce-
ment. They were legal. 
Analogues allow drug traffickers in 
clandestine labs to use the legal sys-
tem and their chemistry knowledge to 
their advantage. By simply tweaking 
the drug and calling it something else 
then, they can avoid prosecution. 
The creation of analogues has out-
paced the DEA’s ability to schedule 
them, so the DEA used emergency au-
thorities that we have given them to 
temporarily place all previously un-
scheduled fentanyl analogues in sched-
ule I so the administration could com-
bat all fentanyl-related substances in-
stead of just going after one substance 
at a time. 
Since the instatement of the sched-
uling order, the DEA has encountered 
over 
20 
fentanyl-related substances 
that would have been perfectly legal 
but for this law. 
Because of the number of possible 
variations to the fentanyl molecule, 
there is the potential for these bad ac-
tors—these killers—to create 3,000 ana-
logues. There is no way the DEA could 
keep up one by one. Many of these sub-
stances will be legal again if no action 
is taken. 
The DEA’s ability to schedule all 
fentanyl substances expires next week. 
That is why Congress must act, and it 
must act now. 
This is what we were fighting about 
yesterday, as Republicans, to get this 
bill on the floor. It shouldn’t have 
come to the last minute, but I am glad 
it is here. The Senate has passed this 
bill, unanimously, some time ago, and 
S. 3201 is before us today. 
Last Congress, we were able to put 
partisanship aside to pass the SUP-
PORT Act, landmark legislation to 
combat the opioid crisis. Synthetic 
opioids like fentanyl and its analogues 
continue to ravage our communities 
and take lives, and I am pleased that, 
again, we put partisanship aside today 
to 
extend 
this 
critical 
emergency 
scheduling order. This way, law en-
forcement does not lose its important 
capability to combat trafficking of 
fentanyl-related substances. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to join me in support of this 
important legislation and to preserve 
this tool for law enforcement and those 
on the front lines of our communities 
fighting this opioid crisis that is so 
deadly. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding to 
me. 
I rise to agree with my colleagues 
that we are facing a crisis. The number 
of overdoses and deaths related to 
fentanyl has skyrocketed over the last 
few years; however, the emergency 
scheduling of fentanyl and its ana-
logues or any other substance as a 
schedule I drug has serious criminal 
justice implications. 
We should not forget our history and 
what happened to communities of color 
during the failed war on drugs. We 
can’t forget that classifying a sub-
stance as a schedule I drug comes with 
harsh mandatory minimum sentences 
that even the lowest quantity can trig-
ger. 
We cannot forget that over 60 percent 
of people federally charged for drug 
possession and over 95 percent of people 
charged with drug trafficking receive a 
prison sentence. We should not forget 
that over 78 percent of people charged 
with a fentanyl trafficking offense are 
people of color. 
We must work together to prioritize 
a public health solution, not just a 
criminal justice one, to the fentanyl 
epidemic. We must remember that a 
criminal justice approach dispropor-
tionately impacts people of color and 
does not necessarily reduce the crime. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to address the problems that 
this bill possibly could create. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I thank the gentlewoman for those 
comments, and I echo the need to ad-
dress mandatory minimum sentencing 
and comprehensive criminal justice re-
form. 
The opioid epidemic is not a problem 
that we can jail our way out of, and it 
is imperative that we work together to 
fix our broken criminal justice system 
that unjustly incarcerates Black and 
brown Americans at alarming rates. 
I agree that we cannot repeat the 
mistakes of the past in responding to 
drug epidemics, but the dramatic in-
creases in fentanyl-related deaths re-
quire us to act. Ensuring that the DEA 
has the authority to ban new synthetic 
analogues, most of which are being 
manufactured by criminal chemists in 
China, is important to curb the influx 
of fentanyl. 
I believe that a critical component of 
criminal justice reform is improving 
health access and coverage for incar-
cerated individuals, many of whom suf-
fer from substance misuse disorder and 
mental health issues with a co-occur-
ring mental health disorder. 
I have introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion, the Humane Correctional Health 
Care Act, which aims to break the 
cycle of reincarceration and recidivism 
by repealing the Medicaid Inmate Ex-
clusion, which blocks access to care. 
Healthcare is a fundamental human 
right that should never be stripped 
from any person for any reason. 
The legislation that we are voting on 
today will give lawmakers additional 
time to craft a long-term plan for 
fentanyl while also considering com-
prehensive criminal justice reform, and 
I welcome the opportunity to work 
with the gentlewoman on this criti-
cally important issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BURGESS), the ranking member of 
the Health Subcommittee. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I am going speak in support of S. 
3201, the Temporary Reauthorization 
and Study of the Emergency Sched-
uling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. It is 
a critical reauthorization. It is impera-
tive to maintaining our Nation’s ef-
forts to fix the opioid epidemic. 
In February of 2018, the Drug En-
forcement Administration used its au-
thority—not legislative authority, but 
administrative 
authority—to 
place 
nonscheduled fentanyl-like substances 
temporarily into schedule I for a period 
of 2 years. We are now up against that 
deadline, and it is important that we 
do not let this authorization lapse, as 
fentanyl and its analogues are still an 
imminent threat to Americans. 
b 1245 
The Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion testified before the Senate Judici-
ary Committee in June 2019 that: The 
positive impacts in the 15 months since 
this administrative scheduling change 
were significant. Prior to this action, 
DEA observed a rapid and continuing 
emergence of new fentanyl-like sub-
stances each time it scheduled a 
fentanyl-like substance into schedule I. 
We really cannot return to that re-
ality. Let me speak a little bit about 
what that reality is. Someone who is 
buying what they think is their stand-
ard fentanyl product from an illicit 
Chinese chemist and now buys a 
fentanyl analogue because it may not 
be illegal, those additional molecules 
change the potency of fentanyl so that 
some of these analogues are signifi-
cantly more potent than the base mol-
ecule. In a country that has suffered 
with an unprecedented number of drug 
overdose deaths, that is a significant 
issue. 
This Friday marks the anniversary of 
the United States Customs and Border 
Protection seizure of a record volume 
of 
fentanyl 
and 
methamphetamine 
worth almost $4.5 million at the bor-
der. These drugs were on their way to 
our American communities. They were 
on their way to hurt Americans. 
You know, it is not lost on me the 
irony that the USMCA was signed 
today, a bill that could have been 
signed many, many months ago. Now 
we are doing this bill as a hurry-up, as

a suspension. It could have been done 
many months ago. Congress has been 
distracted with other activities, and 
that is incorrect. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an important 
bill, and I urge its passage. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I appreciate her previous remarks, but 
I still have concerns about this bill be-
cause it is another so-called tough-on- 
crime bill that fails to address the true 
causes of the opioid crisis and will re-
sult in more incarceration of more 
drug users and street-level sellers. 
Furthermore, there is nothing in the 
bill that targets the laboratories out-
side of the United States that are re-
sponsible for flooding our communities 
with fentanyl and fentanyl analogues. 
Mr. Speaker, since President Nixon 
declared a war on drugs nearly 50 years 
ago, laws that ignore evidence and re-
search in favor of harsh penalties and 
more mandatory minimums have suc-
ceeded in placing the United States as 
number one in the world in incarcer-
ation. 
Mass incarceration has gotten so bad 
that some studies have shown that it 
actually adds to crime rather than re-
ducing crime. For example, too many 
children are being raised by parents in 
prison, and too many people have fel-
ony records who can’t find jobs because 
they are victims of bills like this. 
Mr. Speaker, I have three main con-
cerns regarding this legislation. 
First, the bill abandons evidence and 
expertise in exchange for expediency. 
We have a process that works well for 
designating 
controlled 
substances 
under the Controlled Substances Act. 
This bill changes that process and al-
lows DOJ to ignore the experts at the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services and the Federal Drug Admin-
istration. 
Classwide scheduling would give the 
Drug Enforcement Administration the 
ability to classify any new alternative 
chemical version of fentanyl as a 
schedule I drug. That would encompass 
hundreds and possibly thousands of 
chemical compounds. 
This bill also stifles research that 
could produce some of the best weapons 
against the opioid crisis. For example, 
lifesaving overdose treatments like 
Narcan could not have been developed 
under classwide scheduling because 
such scheduling creates enormous bar-
riers for chemists studying opioid ad-
diction by actually limiting access to 
the entire class of chemical com-
pounds. 
Second, the bill will add to mass in-
carceration. This bill will allow pros-
ecution of street-level criminals, like 
we had in the 1980s and 1990s. And the 
bill will trigger the same mandatory 
minimums that have contributed to 
mass incarceration. 
Possessing an analogue substance in 
a quantity equivalent to the weight of 
one paperclip would be enough to trig-
ger a mandatory minimum of at least 5 
years. A person does not even have to 
know the drug they are selling on the 
street or sharing with a friend contains 
that analogue substance. Classwide 
scheduling even allows prosecutors to 
seek longer sentences without a mens 
rea requirement. 
Third, this bill includes unnecessary 
legislation. The Department of Justice 
already prosecutes cases involving drug 
analogues under existing law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentleman. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
the Federal Analogue Act allows pros-
ecutors to prove that a substance is 
chemically similar to fentanyl and has 
the same psychoactive effects. The 
Federal Analogue Act protects due 
process rights and is an important 
check on overcriminalization. 
Let’s not enact another law that 
sends more people to prison while ig-
noring the root causes of the present 
crisis, which is substance abuse and 
which should be dealt with as a public 
health problem. 
That is the approach we should take, 
and we can take that approach by re-
jecting this bill. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) for yielding and 
for his support for prompt consider-
ation of this bill today. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of S. 3201, the Temporary Re-
authorization and Study of the Emer-
gency Scheduling of Fentanyl Ana-
logues Act. 
In just a few short days, the DEA 
temporary ban of deadly fentanyl will 
expire. While I am relieved that the 
House will vote on this extension of the 
fentanyl ban today, I remain deeply 
troubled that this lifesaving bill was 
delayed by the political distractions. 
Mr. Speaker, in both your and my 
districts, we have seen the devastation 
of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues. As 
a doctor, I have witnessed this drug 
crisis firsthand. Substance abuse and 
addiction have devastated individuals 
in my district of Pennsylvania and in 
every one of my colleagues’ districts 
across America. 
Fentanyl 
and 
its 
analogues 
are 
uniquely dangerous and deadly and 
have caused way too many overdose 
deaths from opioids in the last 2 years. 
We must act to protect the people that 
we represent from these deadly sub-
stances. 
Mr. Speaker, just a few days ago, you 
and I heard from ONDCP Director 
James Carroll about the importance of 
passing this specific piece of legisla-
tion. 
It is shameful that we waited until 
now to act on this lifesaving legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
renew this ban immediately. We cannot 
afford to wait. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Let me express my appreciation to 
Representative 
KUSTER
for 
her 
unending fight on this terrible scourge 
of drug addiction and death across the 
Nation. I look forward to working with 
her on her the Humane Correctional 
Health Care Act, H.R. 4141, as well as 
the Judiciary Committee taking this 
up in the near future to begin to ad-
dress some of the wide scope issues 
that have to be addressed. 
I am reminded of the tenure here in 
the United States Congress, where the 
impact of the arrest of addicted per-
sons to crack and cocaine resulted in 
mass incarceration and upward of 2 
million people incarcerated in this Na-
tion, higher than any nation around 
the world. 
I am reminded of the 2010 enactment 
of legislation that I wrote and passed, 
along with my colleagues, that set to 
reduce, through the Fair Sentencing 
Act, 
the 
unjust 
disparity 
between 
crack and cocaine from 100-to-1 to 18- 
to-1. 
President Obama granted clemency 
to almost 2,000 individuals serving 
lengthy sentences for drug offenses 
during his administration. 
Now, I realize in my own community 
in Houston, Texas, there have been 149 
deaths documented by the Harris Coun-
ty Institute of Forensic Sciences in 
2017, up from 79 in 2015. I also realize 
that, according to the drug policy 
guidelines, accidental drug overdose is 
the leading cause of death in the 
United States for those under 50. 
With that in mind, wouldn’t it have 
been preferable, even with the legisla-
tion that is included that does, in fact, 
have a study that would include the 
civil rights and criminal justice com-
munity’s input? I believe that input 
should have been in the forefront be-
cause here is the singular problem I 
want to emphasize: Classwide sched-
uling would facilitate broader prosecu-
tions with harsher penalties and fewer 
constitutional due process protections, 
according to Mr. Kevin Butler, who ap-
peared before the Judiciary Committee 
yesterday. 
The Department has indicated that it 
will use classwide scheduling to pursue 
severe mandatory minimums for any-
one trafficking in an undefined and po-
tentially limitless set of substances 
without having to prove those sub-
stances are or were intended to harm 
the human body. 
Now, we know what the analogues 
will do. Here is our point: Our point is 
when I asked the Justice Department 
about who they would prosecute, they 
did indicate that they would not be 
prosecuting 
addicted 
persons.

there are low-level traffickers. There 
are people who are addicted who are 
trafficking. So all you are going to do 
is to build up, again, the residency of 
the Nation’s jails. That burden will fall 
heavily on African Americans and 
Latinos and other vulnerable people. 
I want the scourge to end. I want the 
DEA to be able to work within the con-
fines of the law. I want to work with 
the Congresswoman in her hard work, 
but what I will say is that this bill 
needs to expire as soon as possible. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we 
need to move swiftly, as this bill may 
be passed today, in order to avoid expi-
ration, so that we can work collec-
tively together for what parents of the 
addicted and others want: treatment 
services, wraparound services. 
We must be able to say that we are 
not going to take the average guy on 
the street with a dime or a dollar, try-
ing to survive by selling it and adding 
that person to the prison population, 
and not trying to save lives. 
Let’s save lives with treatment. Let’s 
save lives by getting rid of the cartels 
and the large sellers. But let’s not 
build up our mass incarceration again. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a very important hearing 
as we in the Congress continue to deal with 
the opioid crisis as a nation. According to the 
Drug Policy Alliance, ‘‘accidental drug over-
dose is currently the leading cause of death in 
the United States for those under 50. Drug 
overdose deaths now exceed those attrib-
utable to firearms, car accidents, homicides, or 
HIV/AIDS. More Americans died from a drug 
overdose in 2017 alone than died in the entire 
Vietnam War. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe that we need 
to reduce drug overdose deaths by promoting 
sensible, evidence-based solutions at the fed-
eral level. The Houston region also saw an 
uptick in opioid overdose deaths during the 
last few years, according to data from the Har-
ris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. 
There were 149 deaths documented by the of-
fice in 2017, up from the 79 recorded in 2015. 
Nearly 64,000 people died of a drug over-
dose in 2016, a staggering 22 percent in-
crease from the year prior. 
Nearly two-thirds of 2016 deaths (66 per-
cent) involved a prescription or illicit opioid. 
Recent increases in death are driven by 
synthetic opioids like fentanyl—deaths from 
synthetic opioids more than doubled from 
2015 to 2016 alone. 
Overdose deaths are increasing across ra-
cial groups, but non-Hispanic whites have the 
highest rates of death. 
It is important that we have a hearing to dis-
cuss whether or not the lethal opioid Fentanyl 
and its analogues to extend the temporary 
order to place it as a Schedule I drug. Factors 
such as poverty, lack of economic opportunity, 
and limited access to a social safety net 
meant that there was ready demand for those 
opioids. Once people become addicted, we 
have little infrastructure in place to ensure 
they receive the education, care, and treat-
ment they need to prevent fatal overdoses. 
The Drug Policy Alliance states that, ‘‘Many 
states are reporting sharp increases in 
fentanyl-related overdose deaths. Fentanyl 
overdoses occur in seconds to minutes, often 
with the needle still inserted. Most users do 
not appear to be seeking fentanyl and are not 
aware that their illicit drugs may contain 
fentanyl. The heroin (particularly white powder 
heroin), methamphetamine, and cocaine sup-
ply is all at risk for fentanyl adulteration. There 
have also been cases of counterfeit Xanax 
and Oxycodone tablets that contain fentanyl. 
‘‘Most of the fentanyl on the black market is 
not from the medical supply; it is produced ille-
gally. Though some fentanyl enters U.S. mar-
kets directly via the dark web, most fentanyl is 
being added to the drug supply before it en-
ters the U.S., so domestic sellers may not 
know their drug products are contaminated 
with fentanyl. There are public health and 
harm reduction responses to fentanyl that are 
effective in reducing overdose deaths.’’ 
I am interested in learning more as to 
whether extending Fentanyl as a Schedule I 
drug or even making it permanent as a Sched-
ule I drug will increase penalties for fentanyl, 
that will simply end up increasing penalties for 
heroin and contribute to more incarceration. 
Lastly, I think we should all be concerned 
about the long-term effects of extending the 
temporary scheduling order would have on 
communities of color as well as low income 
communities in both urban and rural America. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding. I look forward to 
working with her, and I look forward 
to getting a better bill in the future. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
her comments, and I look forward to 
our work together going forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. WALBERG), a very important 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. WALDEN, my friend, for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 3201. 
Opioids, 
heroin, 
fentanyl, 
and 
fentanyl-like substances have ravaged 
the communities of all of us, like mine, 
across this Nation. Synthetic opioids 
have claimed the lives of tens of thou-
sands of Americans last year, and I 
have heard firsthand some of those dev-
astating stories from friends, neigh-
bors, and constituents in my district. 
The DEA has been able to combat 
this part of the epidemic by changing 
the scheduling so that the administra-
tion could combat all fentanyl-related 
substances. 
Passing S. 3201 will allow law en-
forcement the leeway to properly com-
bat these fentanyl-like substances. 
My support of this measure is strong, 
but I am admittedly frustrated. We 
need to make this scheduling classi-
fication permanent. We cannot let ex-
piration dates approach while political 
games that we have seen for months 
and months now take the spotlight and 
consume precious legislative time that 
could have indeed helped to deal with 
some of the concerns my friends on the 
other side of the aisle expressed about 
minimum mandatories and criminal 
justice reform. 
We have come dangerously close to 
the expiration of the temporary order 
making 
fentanyl-related 
substances 
schedule I. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 3201, but I also encourage 
immediate action to be taken to make 
these changes permanent and to stop 
using political games to stand in the 
way of doing things like this. Pass this 
legislation today. 
b 1300 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, we do not have any more 
speakers, and I am prepared to close if 
my Republican colleagues don’t have 
any more speakers. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, we have 
several more people who would like to 
speak on this. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), 
the lone pharmacist in the U.S. House 
of Representatives. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in 
support of S. 3201 to extend the emer-
gency scheduling of fentanyl and its 
analogues. 
Fentanyl is a synthetic, which means 
man-made, opioid. It is 50 times more 
potent than heroin, and 100 times more 
potent than morphine. 
And while fentanyl is a schedule II 
drug, traffickers have been able to 
make small changes to the drug as a 
way around DEA enforcement. These 
fentanyl-like substances can be just as 
dangerous, if not more deadly, than 
traditional opioids. And the pain they 
have caused communities across the 
country is immeasurable. 
To combat these drugs, DEA used its 
authority to temporarily ban these 
products, but that extension expires 
next week. The fact that we are just 
now addressing this issue with 1 week 
to go, has been flirting with disaster. 
That is why I am so thankful that we 
are here passing this bill to protect our 
communities 
from 
deadly 
fentanyl 
products. 
This administration has put fighting 
back against the opioid crisis front and 
center from day one. And in the past 
several years under Republican leader-
ship, the House passed a series of com-
prehensive, bipartisan legislative pack-
ages to help American communities 
combat addiction. 
We must all keep up that fight. I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin 
(Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER), 
the 
former chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee and the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee. 
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in support of S. 3201.

Without this 15-month extension, dan-
gerous fentanyl analogues will fall 
through a legal loophole in just 8 days. 
If there ever was a must-pass bill, this 
it is. 
Importantly though, the scourge of 
fentanyl analogues needs to be ad-
dressed permanently. Drug traffickers 
are increasingly savvy and sophisti-
cated; they can alter the chemical 
composition of these drugs, creating 
analogues that don’t fall under the 
drug-scheduling protocol. 
DEA has taken emergency steps to 
combat these analogues which we will 
temporarily extend today, but we owe 
it to our constituents to permanently 
schedule these drugs. This is about sav-
ing lives. 
I 
have 
legislation, 
the 
Stopping 
Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act, 
or SOFA, to place these drugs on 
schedule I and to give the DEA the au-
thority to combat new analogues that 
arise. 
We need to pass SOFA to protect our 
communities, and we need to pass 
SOFA to save lives. 
I want to highlight how dangerous 
these substances are. One teaspoon of 
fentanyl is enough to kill 2,000 people. 
This lethality puts fentanyl and its 
analogues in a class with chemical war-
fare agents like VX nerve gas and ricin. 
Scheduling fentanyl analogues is a 
matter of life or death. We must choose 
life. The attorneys general of all 50 
States and the Attorney General of the 
United States have all called for the 
passage of SOFA and the permanent 
scheduling of fentanyl analogues. 
I urge my colleagues to do our part 
to protect the American people to save 
lives. Pass this bill, and then let’s pass 
SOFA. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, we have 
one more speaker who is making her 
way here, and so I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that 
I appreciate my colleagues who have 
come to the floor to speak on this bill. 
I think everyone knows that this is a 
very personal issue for me, not just be-
cause of my own constituents, but be-
cause of my own family, and I appre-
ciate the bipartisan support for this 
bill. 
I do want to work with my colleagues 
in the Judiciary Committee and in the 
Congressional Black Caucus and others 
on reform of sentencing guidelines. I 
think we can make that kind of 
progress during the 15 months, and I 
hope that I will get bipartisan support 
for my legislation which would bring 
treatment for mental health issues and 
substance use disorder into the justice- 
served population, because my view is 
that we have created a system that is 
not functional and not serving the pur-
poses of the American people or the 
American taxpayers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
league and friend from New Hampshire 
for her leadership on this and her deep 
caring about it. It is something we all 
share. We all have our stories, both 
personal and throughout our districts, 
that we have heard over the years 
about the tragedy of addiction. 
When we worked on the opioid legis-
lation the last Congress when I chaired 
the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
we heard from so many Members who 
came and made their case when we had 
Member Day from then-Democratic 
Leader PELOSI
to everybody—right, 
left, center—and we took all of those 
ideas and did what this body does best: 
We converted them into legislation. We 
had over 50 bills and it became one in 
the SUPPORT Act which is now law. 
We also continued our investigation 
through the end of 2018 looking at how 
this abuse got out of control from the 
prescribers, from the distributors, from 
the illegal traffickers, every bit of 
that, and I hope before this Congress is 
over, we go back, look at the rec-
ommendations from that report, and 
see what else we need to do. 
There were Member ideas that did 
not make it all the way through the 
process last time that we should be fo-
cused on. Obviously, there is certainly 
interest in criminal justice reform, and 
I dare say—and I will be careful how I 
say this—but perhaps the Judiciary 
Committee could have used some of its 
time differently earlier in this Con-
gress to address these pressing issues 
as opposed to some of the matters it 
decided to focus on. 
We have more work to do in this 
space to get treatment, to get justice, 
and to stop these purveyors of death. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. 
RODGERS), a very important member of 
our Energy and Commerce Committee 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. I appreciate his extraordinary 
leadership for us on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Across America, drug abuse and ad-
diction are leading to broken lives, 
broken families, and broken systems. 
It is leaving our communities trapped 
in a cycle of hopelessness and deaths of 
despair. People need help. People need 
hope. 
I have heard these stories myself in 
eastern Washington. Last year, the 
SUPPORT Act marked the most com-
prehensive action we have taken on a 
single drug crisis, but the fight is not 
over. 
In 2017, there were tens of thousands 
of drug overdose deaths. The sharpest 
increase occurred because of fentanyl 
from China. Fentanyl is 50 times more 
potent than heroin. Just a few milli-
grams that can fit on Lincoln’s ear on 
a penny, are lethal. 
Chinese chemical companies are the 
largest, single source of this. To crack 
down on China, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration created a temporary 
scheduling system for fentanyl. Pre-
viously, drug traffickers could slightly 
change the molecules in the drug so 
the formula was not considered prohib-
ited. With this scheduling tool, the 
DEA changed the scheduling tempo-
rarily in order to combat all fentanyl- 
related substances. 
This legislation would extend this 
emergency declaration through May 
2021, and it will give law enforcement 
the tools they need to keep us safe. 
We must keep fentanyl off our streets 
to save lives and to win the future. 
That means cracking down on Chinese 
fentanyl and stopping these deaths of 
despair which are not only threatening 
families, they are threatening Amer-
ica’s leadership and prosperity. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time does each side have remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 33⁄4 minutes re-
maining. The time of the gentlewoman 
from New Hampshire has expired. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this is one of those rare 
moments of bipartisanship on the floor. 
This is a killer issue in every respect. 
I am pleased we are finally getting this 
signed through this process and down 
to the President to be signed after the 
vote today, which I assume will go 
well. 
There is much more work to be done 
in this space to help those who suffer 
from substance use disorder and help 
those in our communities who are con-
fronted with mental health disease and 
no place to get assistance or the proper 
assistance. 
It is true that our jails and our pris-
ons are often where we house people 
with mental health disorders because 
we have no other place, and that is not 
the right course for treatment. 
Today, we take a big and important 
step to try and stop these illegal and 
deadly analogues of fentanyl. We have 
all heard how potent they are and how 
deadly they are. It gets mixed in with 
the heroin and people take it, and that 
is why we see the circles of death in 
our communities when it is too strong 
for the human body to take. 
Today, is an important day, Mr. 
Speaker. I wish it had been done much 
sooner so there wasn’t this sort of cra-
ziness in the end: Are we going to get 
this done? Is it going to expire? It 
doesn’t have to be that way, and obvi-
ously, there are more issues to be 
taken up. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support. S. 3201, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, we as a Con-
gress have worked over the past several 
years to combat the opioid epidemic and sup-
port the millions of Americans with a sub-
stance use disorder. That work includes bipar-
tisan efforts to pass legislation like the 21st 
Century Cures Act, the Comprehensive Addic-
tion and Recovery Act (CARA), and the SUP-
PORT for Patients and Communities Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H653 
January 29, 2020 
Just last month, in the Fiscal Year 2020 
funding bill, we supported a public health re-
sponse to this epidemic with over $4 billion to 
help with Federal substance abuse treatment 
and prevention efforts. Also last month, the 
House passed H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings 
Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which included an 
additional $10 billion in funding to support 
public health efforts at the Department of 
Health and Human Services to combat the 
opioid epidemic. 
Earlier this month, the Energy and Com-
merce Committee had a chance to hear di-
rectly from States on how our federal support 
through these legislative actions has helped 
save lives. Although we’ve witnessed an im-
provement in the number of year-to-year over-
dose deaths, the availability of synthetic 
opioids like fentanyl is hindering the progress 
we’ve made. 
Fentanyl is a deadly synthetic drug that is 
50 times more powerful than heroin, and 100 
times more powerful than morphine. Although 
it is used in medical settings, we have seen a 
proliferation 
of 
illicitly 
produced 
fentanyl, 
fentanyl analogues, and its precursor chemi-
cals originating from China. Because fentanyl 
is relatively easy to make and so potent, it is 
tragically leading to large increases in over-
dose deaths. 
We have all heard the terrible numbers that 
tell this story. In 2017, there were over 47,000 
opioid overdose deaths—and 28,000 of those 
deaths involved synthetic opioids such as 
fentanyl. My home State of New Jersey, for 
example, has seen a tenfold increase in 
deaths involving fentanyl in the last several 
years. 
A more complicating factor is that we are 
now seeing fentanyl increasingly mixed into 
other drugs like cocaine, methamphetamine, 
and even counterfeit prescription drugs like 
oxycodone. 
This 
means 
that 
many 
unsuspecting people are dying at the hands of 
fentanyl when they didn’t even realize they 
were taking it. 
Mr. Speaker, the nature of our Nation’s 
fentanyl problem is more complex than drug 
epidemics of the past. In addition to traditional 
routes, users can purchase fentanyl analogues 
and fentanyl precursor chemicals online. 
These purchases, which typically include the 
most pure and potent fentanyl, are often pack-
aged and shipped through the United States 
postal system or consignment carriers in small 
quantities, making detection a significant chal-
lenge. All these factors combined make for 
complex problem, and requires a multifaceted 
solution. Part of that solution is finding a way 
to support both public health and public safety 
actions aimed at stemming the tide of over-
dose deaths. 
In February 2018, the Drug Enforcement 
Agency (DEA) used its authority in the Con-
trolled Substances Act to temporarily place for 
two years all illicit fentanyl-like substances in 
Schedule I. With this authority expiring next 
month, we must do more to understand the 
true impact of this temporary scheduling order, 
including its impact on public safety, public 
health, research, and federal criminal prosecu-
tions. 
That is why today we are considering S. 
3201, the ‘‘Temporary Reauthorization and 
Study of Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl 
Analogues Act.’’ The Senate bill would extend 
DEA’s temporary order for 15 months while 
also tasking the Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) with an evaluation of the tem-
porary order. 
Placing a whole class of fentanyl-like sub-
stances into Schedule I does not come without 
implications for criminal justice and research. 
The National Institute on Drug Abuse within 
the National Institutes of Health, notes that 
‘‘obtaining or modifying a Schedule I registra-
tion involved significant administrative chal-
lenges, and researchers report that obtaining 
a new registration can take more than a year.’’ 
It is critical that our response balance the 
need for legitimate research access that holds 
potential for improved treatments for pain and 
addiction, while also putting in place a more 
long-term solution to the dangerous trafficking 
of fentanyl analogues. 
This temporary emergency scheduling order 
also has international implications. A year after 
the United States moved to schedule all 
fentanyl-related substances, China announced 
it would act and do the same. This class-wide 
control in China has slowed the rate of new 
fentanyl analogue encounters in the illicit mar-
ket. An expiration would also put the DEA 
back in the position of playing whack a mole, 
and taking action to schedule fentanyl sub-
stances one by one while illicit traffickers con-
tinue to evade scheduling and find new ways 
to flood our markets with deadly synthetic sub-
stances. 
I agree with many of my colleagues that we 
cannot arrest our way out of this epidemic. 
The complexity of the fentanyl crisis, and cre-
ation of other synthetic drugs, demands a 
thoughtful, balanced approach that protects 
the public health and public safety of all Amer-
icans. This temporary extension, coupled with 
GAO’s study, will give the committees of juris-
diction time to work on a longer-term solution. 
It will also give us the opportunity to solicit 
feedback to help us to better understand the 
full range of implications that come with class- 
wide scheduling of these substances. 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, 
every 22 hours, a Delaware family loses a 
loved one to an overdose. Unfortunately, that 
figure may increase due to the proliferation of 
synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Fentanyl has 
made this national public health emergency in-
creasingly deadly and increasingly difficult to 
address. My home state of Delaware con-
tinues to see an unacceptably high loss of life 
due to the increasing prevalence of synthetic 
opioids like fentanyl and despite the work 
Congress has done to address this crisis. With 
the passage of the bipartisan SUPPORT Act, 
we took significant steps forward to truly ad-
dress the opioid epidemic. But it is clear that 
we must do more. 
We need a comprehensive response to 
combat the opioid epidemic and the prolifera-
tion of fentanyl. I call on my colleagues to pro-
vide the funding needed to effectively treat 
substance use disorder, funding I proudly 
champion as a supporter of the Respond 
NOW Act, which would provide $5 billion dol-
lars a year to treatment services. And I hope 
to work with my colleagues in the near future 
to advocate for the kind of policies we need to 
effectively respond to fentanyl and finally bring 
the relief our communities deserve. 
We cannot arrest our way out of this crisis 
and this bill gives me serious concern. Sadly, 
our criminal justice system is not able to solve 
this problem. Too often the proposed solution 
has been to take away judicial discretion in 
favor of mandatory minimums, disproportion-
ately affecting the poor and people of color. 
Worse, this drive to incarcerate coupled with 
the lack of effective treatment for substance 
use disorder behind the walls of our correc-
tional institutions threatens to make a national 
crisis into a national disaster. While controlling 
the flow of illicit fentanyl can help mitigate this 
crisis, it can only do so temporarily. And that 
is why I support S. 3201 today because while 
it is far from perfect, we need to try and curb 
the increase of addiction and death by 
fentanyl because too often, these tragic 
deaths disproportionately impact people of 
color. This bill will only extend the DEA’s 
scheduling order for 15 months and require an 
important study to give us the information we 
need to truly solve this calamity. It will give us 
time to create the long-term solution the coun-
try needs. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Hampshire 
(Ms. KUSTER) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, S. 3201. 
The question was taken.

January 29, 2020 
the first section of House Resolution 
811 and shall not exceed 1 hour equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Financial Services. 
The gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. WATERS) and the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY) each 
will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3621, the Comprehensive Credit 
Reporting Enhancement, Disclosure, 
Innovation, and Transparency Act, leg-
islation sponsored by Representative 
AYANNA
PRESSLEY
of Massachusetts. 
This package of bills builds upon re-
forms that members of the Financial 
Services Committee have been devel-
oping for several Congresses. 
Mr. Chairman, credit reporting is un-
like any other business. Consumers are 
not customers of credit reporting agen-
cies; they are the product. Credit re-
porting 
agencies 
package 
up 
con-
sumers’ data to sell to lenders, employ-
ers, and other businesses. 
Unfortunately, our system of con-
sumer credit reporting is badly broken, 
and consumers have little recourse. It 
is typical for credit reports to be filled 
with unacceptable errors that are dif-
ficult for consumers to correct. A Fed-
eral Trade Commission study found 
that 
one 
in 
five 
consumers 
have 
verified errors in their credit reports, 
and 1 in 20 consumers have errors so se-
rious that they would be denied credit 
or need to pay more for it. This means 
about 42 million consumers have errors 
in their credit reports and 10 million 
have reports that can be life-altering. 
Consumers are frustrated with the 
current system. In 2018, the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau received 
126,300 consumer complaints on credit 
reporting, which was more than one- 
third of all complaints submitted. The 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
received more complaints about credit 
reporting than any other issue. 
This legislative package makes crit-
ical reforms to help consumers by ad-
dressing problems with the credit re-
porting system. 
The legislation includes H.R. 3642, 
the Improving Credit Reporting for All 
Consumers Act, a bill sponsored by 
Representative ALMA
ADAMS, which 
would address burdens consumers expe-
rience when trying to remove errors 
from their consumer reports, including 
by providing a new right to appeal the 
results of initial reviews about the ac-
curacy or completeness of disputed 
items on the report. 
The package also includes H.R. 3622, 
the Restoring Unfairly Impaired Credit 
and Protecting Consumers Act, a bill 
sponsored by Representative RASHIDA 
TLAIB. This part of the bill would limit 
how long adverse credit information 
stays on consumer reports, and it 
would protect consumer victims by re-
moving adverse information relating to 
predatory, discriminatory, or other-
wise unlawful loans made by a finan-
cial institution. It would also prohibit 
reporting debt relating to medically 
necessary procedures and delay report-
ing by 1 year for other medical debt. 
In addition, the package includes 
H.R. 3614, the Restricting Use of Credit 
Checks for Employment Decisions Act, 
a bill sponsored by Representative AL 
LAWSON. This part of the bill would 
prohibit employers from using credit 
reports for employment decisions, ex-
cept when a credit report is otherwise 
required to conduct a background 
check by Federal, State, or local law or 
for a national security clearance. 
Then there is H.R. 3621, the Student 
Borrower Credit Improvement Act, a 
bill 
sponsored 
by 
Representative 
PRESSLEY, which is also included in the 
legislation. This part of the bill would 
help student borrowers who may have 
been delinquent on paying their private 
student loans to repair their credit 
after they demonstrate a history of 
timely 
loan 
repayments 
for 
these 
loans, similar to how the credit reports 
of borrowers with Federal student 
loans can be rehabilitated. 
Another key measure included in this 
package is H.R. 3629, the Clarity in 
Credit Score Formation Act, sponsored 
by 
Representative 
STEPHEN
LYNCH. 
This legislation would direct the CFPB 
to provide oversight and set standards 
for validating the accuracy and pre-
dictive value of credit score models, 
and it would promote innovation by re-
quiring a study on how the use of non-
traditional data might impact the 
availability and affordability of credit 
for consumers with limited or no tradi-
tional credit histories. 
Finally, the package includes H.R. 
3618, the Free Credit Scores for Con-
sumers Act, sponsored by Representa-
tive JOYCE BEATTY, which would direct 
the nationwide CRAs to give con-
sumers free copies of their credit scores 
that are used by creditors in making 
credit decisions, as determined by the 
CFPB, 
whenever 
consumers 
obtain 
their free annual consumer reports. 
I am pleased that this bill also in-
cludes a provision that I have worked 
on with a range of other Members that 
excludes from credit reports any ad-
verse information about a Federal em-
ployee and others who are affected by a 
government shutdown. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to 
support these commonsense reforms to 
improve the Nation’s consumer report-
ing system and benefit hardworking 
American consumers. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to 
the bill before us. This is a Democrat 
bill under the guise of consumer pro-
tection that will destroy the accuracy 
and completeness of consumer credit 
files. This will lead to a weaker finan-
cial system, undermining a great deal 
of safety and soundness that we have 
built up over decades. This will, in es-
sence, socialize credit scoring and, 
therefore, credit allocation. 
Mr. Chairman, this is an election 
year. I see that, and I see that not just 
in the rhetoric here in the House but in 
the legislation that is before us today. 
This bill will weaken underwriting 
standards. It will make extending cred-
it a riskier and more expensive activ-
ity, ultimately impacting both the cost 
and accessibility of credit for all Amer-
icans. 
Let me be clear. For more than 1 
year now, I have made the same state-
ment on the House floor when the 
House Financial Services Committee 
has a bill here on the floor. Committee 
Republicans stand ready to work with 
the Democrats on issues that are im-
portant to the American people, and 
this bill is a prime example of this. We 
support policies that create jobs, grow 
our economy, and make our Nation 
more secure. 
Today is no different. Republicans 
want to work with Democrats to help 
all consumers, especially consumers 
who may be struggling to access the 
necessary credit to apply for a home 
loan or replace a broken washing ma-
chine or perhaps even start a small 
business. 
We want to reach a bipartisan com-
promise to reform the Fair Credit Re-
porting Act, or FCRA. We want to find 
a compromise that meaningfully helps 
consumers and, at the same time, 
stands a chance of being signed into 
law. 
This bill is not that. I fear my col-
leagues have thrown out bipartisanship 
in favor of satisfying political allies in 
an election year. 
This bill socializes credit modeling 
giving, the CFPB, an unaccountable 
bureau within the government, the 
ability to develop, maintain, and regu-
late credit modeling and factors used 
in analysis. 
You will have politicians making the 
decisions on how credit is scored, Mr. 
Chairman. That is a dangerous thing 
and something in the United States we 
should not stand for. 
This bill prevents employers from 
knowing the creditworthiness of em-
ployees. This creates a situation in 
which employees who are in significant 
debt could be targets of bribes or extor-
tion or perhaps take money that is 
owed to other people. 
This bill creates a boon for the trial 
lawyers, creating new reinvestigation 
and appeals processes to be exploited 
by the trial bar. 
This bill diminishes the value of a 
credit score as a determining factor in 
extending credit—I don’t think that is 
a secondary fact; I think that is the 
primary goal of this bill—by removing 
past credit scores after 2 years from a 
report and prohibiting those scores 
within the 2-year period from being 
used as a factor. 
This bill also arbitrarily changes the 
time period negative information, such 
as a missed payment, remain on a con-
sumer’s credit report.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H655 
January 29, 2020 
This bill makes it more difficult for 
private lenders to compete in the stu-
dent loan industry by allowing delin-
quent borrowers or a borrower who has 
defaulted on a loan to rehabilitate 
their credit outside of the contractual 
terms. 
This bill imposes unfunded mandates 
on the private sector to really an un-
precedented degree. 
These provisions make clear what 
Democrats want to accomplish in this 
bill. They want to socialize credit and 
the models underlying credit alloca-
tion. This bill takes credit reporting 
out of the hands of the private sector 
and gives it to the government. 
Let me be clear. I am no fan of the 
large credit reporting agencies, also 
known as CRAs. In fact, during our one 
hearing on this topic last February, 
nearly 1 year ago at this point—I use 
the term loosely—that we discussed 
this bill, because it was just a discus-
sion draft and much different from 
what we have before us. But in that 
hearing, we didn’t discuss the implica-
tions of this bill or the FCRA. I made 
it clear at that hearing that I share the 
chairwoman’s concerns with the credit 
reporting agencies, their lack of com-
petition, and their oligopoly. In fact, 
there were aspects of the original dis-
cussion draft of this bill that are not 
part of what we have today that I 
thought had merit and should be ex-
plored in greater detail. 
For example, I have concerns that 
CRAs’ operations are not as consumer- 
friendly as they could be or should be. 
Moreover, not once after that hearing 
did the committee consult with addi-
tional subject matter experts on the in-
efficiencies, 
ineffectiveness, 
or 
im-
provements needed to the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act. Not once after that 
February hearing did we discuss how to 
make CRAs work better for the con-
sumer. Not once did we have real bipar-
tisan discussions about what we could 
achieve and get signed into law. 
This is something that both Repub-
licans and Democrats actually agree 
on, the need to reform this process. I 
agree that we should be disclosing pub-
lic record data sources. I agree we 
should exclude paid medically nec-
essary medical debt from consumer 
credit reports. I agree we should pro-
hibit certain adverse information re-
sulting from financial abuse or preda-
tory lending from being included in 
consumer credit reports. 
In fact, the substitute amendment I 
filed with the Rules Committee that 
was not made in order this day in-
cludes the bipartisan reform I de-
scribed and more. 
Committee Republicans support re-
forms such as prohibiting the use of 
Social Security numbers to verify con-
sumers. Now, this is a primary source 
and a primary ingredient for identity 
fraud. We should take action there, and 
I think we can. 
Committee Republicans also support 
facilitating online credit freezes and 
the removal of credit files for minors 
and children. We also support studying 
the use of nontraditional data in credit 
scoring as well as codifying the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau’s, 
or the CFPB’s, credit reporting reg-
istry. 
I think there are things that we can 
do. Bipartisanship is within our grasp. 
All my colleagues have to do is reach 
out and grab it. 
As I said, Republicans stand ready to 
work with Democrats to help con-
sumers. But this bill is about social-
izing credit and credit allocation, and 
this bill is not the answer to the con-
sumers’ challenge. In fact, the Demo-
crats’ bill will only hurt the very con-
sumers we are trying to help. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to oppose this socialization of credit 
reporting and vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, this 
really should be a bipartisan bill, but 
my friends on the opposite side of the 
aisle have not been willing to really 
work in a bipartisan way. His bill was 
rejected in the Rules Committee be-
cause it was not germane. If he agrees 
with us on all of the items he identi-
fied, he should be supporting this bill. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts 
(Ms. PRESSLEY), who is a sponsor of 
this important legislation. 
b 1330 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, in this 
country, our credit reports are our rep-
utations, determining where you can 
live, where you can work, and how 
much it will cost you to finance every-
thing from a car to a college degree. 
But our credit reporting system is fun-
damentally flawed, rife with inequities 
and disparities that stifle the upward 
mobility of millions of hardworking 
Americans. 
I am proud to rise in support of my 
Comprehensive Credit Reporting En-
hancement, 
Disclosure, 
Innovation, 
and Transparency, or Comprehensive 
CREDIT, Act, a critical package of re-
forms that will improve our fundamen-
tally flawed credit reporting system. 
How and what information is shared 
with credit reporting agencies is espe-
cially important as Americans take on 
ever-increasing debt simply for trying 
to 
afford 
basic 
needs: 
housing, 
healthcare, and higher education. 
Trailing 
only 
mortgages, 
student 
loan debt is now the second highest 
form of consumer debt, impacting 
nearly one-fifth of U.S. households and 
totaling over $1.6 trillion. That is tril-
lion with a T. In my home State of 
Massachusetts, alone, over 855,000 bor-
rowers owe a total of $33.3 billion in 
student loan debt. 
That is why I am especially proud 
the Comprehensive CREDIT Act in-
cludes reforms originally introduced in 
my Student Borrower Credit Improve-
ment Act, reforms that would establish 
a credit rehabilitation process for pri-
vate student loan borrowers facing 
hardship, making students eligible to 
have all associated derogatory remarks 
removed from their credit reports, 
which can otherwise stay on for 7 
years. 
Even if we wipe out all student debt 
tomorrow, the devastating impact on 
consumers’ credit would remain for 
years to come. For that very reason, 
we must give folks a real chance at re-
covery and repair. 
It is estimated that one in five Amer-
icans has a potential error on their 
credit report; but, for too long, credit 
reporting agencies have kept con-
sumers in the dark and made it dif-
ficult to correct errors that do come to 
light. The Comprehensive CREDIT Act 
will ensure that consumers can quickly 
and easily rectify those errors. 
At a time when wages are stagnant 
but the cost of housing, childcare, and 
education continue to rise, we should 
be working to provide our constituents 
pathways to financial stability and 
success. It is why this bill would re-
strict the use of credit scores for most 
hiring decisions, limit the amount of 
time that adverse information can re-
main on a person’s credit profile, and 
ban the reporting of any debt as a re-
sult of medically necessary procedures. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
Comprehensive CREDIT Act and ensure 
a more equitable and transparent cred-
it reporting system for all. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER), who is the 
ranking member of the Consumer Pro-
tection and Financial Institutions Sub-
committee. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chair, the 
bill we are considering today is made of 
six extremely partisan pieces of legis-
lation. This package will not receive 
substantial bipartisan support and is 
dead on arrival in the Senate. 
Unfortunately, instead of working in 
a bipartisan manner to improve credit 
reporting for consumers, the majority 
has chosen to advance legislation that 
simply attacks an industry, to the con-
sumers’ detriment. 
I think the ranking member made a 
number of points a while ago with re-
gard to the willingness of the minority 
to advance a lot of different solutions 
to some of the concerns that we all 
have, yet they were not heard. 
Each piece of legislation in this 
package has one of two goals—the first 
goal is to expand the authority of the 
CFPB over credit modeling; the second 
is to eliminate as much information 
from the credit report as possible— 
both of which will increase the cost of 
credit and make it even more difficult 
for low- and moderate-income families 
to receive a loan. 
If the financial institution is unable 
to analyze a risk, it has to increase the 
cost to be able to cover the additional 
risk. It is just that simple. 
In this Congress, we have had witness 
after witness come before our com-
mittee and praise and support the use 
of alternative credit modeling. Using 
alternative data can increase access to

credit, 
particularly 
for 
low-income 
consumers and the underbanked. 
Instead of supporting efforts to mod-
ernize and increase credit access, the 
majority seems inclined to stifle inno-
vation by requiring the CFPB, an unac-
countable government agency, to de-
termine what factors can be used in 
credit scoring. Putting the government 
in charge of establishing credit scores 
for consumers is a dangerous notion 
that strikes at the heart of economic 
freedom in this country. 
By eliminating the information that 
appears on the credit report, my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
are weakening one of the most objec-
tive and accurate ways to determine 
creditworthiness of borrowers. 
If lenders can no longer rely on a 
credit report to reflect the actual risk 
of a borrower, the lender will be forced 
to increase their rates to ensure they 
are pricing the additional risk they are 
taking. This increased cost of credit 
will directly affect the individuals who 
are on the margins, notably low- and 
moderate-income borrowers. 
While I think the majority may have 
good intentions with this legislation, 
government control of credit modeling 
and decreased access to credit for low- 
income families sounds like a disas-
trous recipe for our economy. That is 
why I am opposing the legislation, Mr. 
Chair, and I urge my colleagues to do 
so as well. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Mrs. BEATTY), who is the chairwoman 
of the Subcommittee on Diversity and 
Inclusion and a sponsor of legislation 
that is a part of this bill, H.R. 3621. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Chair, I want to 
start by thanking Chairwoman WATERS 
and the House Democratic Caucus for 
bringing this package of bills to the 
House 
Floor, 
the 
Comprehensive 
CREDIT Act, which includes my bill, 
the Free Credit Scores for Consumers 
Act. This bill would require the three 
national consumer reporting agencies 
to include a free credit score with a 
consumer’s free annual credit report. 
Under the current law, Mr. Chair, 
every consumer is entitled to a free an-
nual credit report from the three na-
tional credit reporting agencies but not 
a credit score. 
It is important for consumers to have 
free access to the three-digit number 
that affects so much of their financial 
lives; yet too many Americans do not 
actually even know what their credit 
score is, how it is calculated, or where 
to find it. This bill would help remedy 
that problem. 
Critics may say that consumers can 
already receive a free credit score on-
line, but what they don’t tell them is 
that these products use your credit 
data to sell to third parties so they 
can, in turn, market financial products 
back to you. 
This bill allows consumers a one-stop 
shop to get their credit scores directly 
from the credit reporting agencies who 
hold the information that makes up 
those 
scores, 
no 
strings 
attached. 
Moreover, my bill would require more 
financial literacy information about 
credit scores and credit reports to be 
sent to consumers along with these re-
ports. 
I urge my colleagues on the other 
side to stand up for this bill, to stand 
up for their constituents, and to allow 
consumers to take greater control of 
their own financial data. 
And do you know why they can do 
this? Because their constituents are 
our constituents, and they have asked 
for this. So we are asking them to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this piece of legislation. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 31⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR), the Republican 
ranking member of the Oversight and 
Investigations Subcommittee. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Chair, I rise today in 
strong opposition to H.R. 3621, a bill 
that has been misnamed as the Com-
prehensive CREDIT Act of 2020. A more 
appropriate title of the bill would be 
the ‘‘Incomplete and Inaccurate Credit 
Act,’’ because the bill’s core purpose is 
to remove critically important pre-
dictive data from credit reports. 
Even worse, the bill would give un-
precedented authority to the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau to con-
trol, micromanage, and politicize the 
development of credit scoring models. 
This bill and its authors trust in the 
abilities of unelected Washington bu-
reaucrats to price risk for millions of 
Americans, which will result in higher 
cost and fewer choices for consumers 
and will harm low- and middle-income 
borrowers who are trying to build a 
credit profile. 
The accurate pricing of risk is an es-
sential element of a functioning econ-
omy. Pricing a loan, underwriting an 
insurance policy, or tailoring a line of 
credit for a borrower all require a reli-
ance on risk-based metrics. Credit 
scores allow for a holistic view of a 
consumer’s history with financial prod-
ucts and allow an institution to under-
stand that consumer’s ability to honor 
his or her obligations. 
This bill would upend our current 
system of pricing risk by turning over 
the private sector’s creditworthiness 
models to the government and placing 
a wildly unrealistic confidence in cen-
tral planning rather than free enter-
prise. 
My Democrat colleagues continue to 
believe that a centralized bureaucratic 
agency is the best and only option to 
fully protect consumers. The irony is 
that this bill would result in much less 
accurate credit scoring and would 
harm the very people my colleagues 
purport to help. 
If you think that private credit scor-
ing is flawed and disadvantages the 
borrowing public, just wait until the 
government is in charge. We continue 
to see the CFPB’s incompetence on full 
display, and credit scoring will not be 
any different. 
We need a credit reporting system 
that relies on accurate, risk-based, pre-
dictive metrics. Our goal should be to 
allow people with good credit to have 
access to financial products at a rea-
sonable price and to provide means for 
people with lower scores to rebuild 
their credit on a path to a more pros-
perous future. 
Putting credit reporting metrics in 
the hands of unelected bureaucrats and 
boxing out the private sector will make 
financial products more expensive and 
less available for all citizens and have 
detrimental downstream effects on our 
credit-based economy. Worse, it risks 
politicizing credit scores instead of as-
signing scores based on an accurate 
and fulsome credit history. 
We should not replace the account-
ability of market forces and free enter-
prise with the unaccountability of gov-
ernment bureaucracy. This bill will po-
liticize credit reporting by empowering 
an inherently political agency. 
The question is not whether the 
CFPB will fail our constituents; it is 
how badly it will fail them. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this bill. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS), who is a 
sponsor of one of the bills in this com-
prehensive legislative package, H.R. 
3621. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Chair, I rise today 
to join my colleagues in support of 
H.R. 3621, the Comprehensive CREDIT 
Act. 
I commend Chairwoman WATERS, 
Congresswoman PRESSLEY, and my col-
leagues for their leadership and dedica-
tion to ensuring that the credit report-
ing system works for everyone. 
Our Nation’s credit reporting system 
has an impact on hundreds of millions 
of Americans. Credit scores and credit 
reports are increasingly relied on for 
key decisionmaking by creditors, em-
ployers, insurers, and even law enforce-
ment. However, it has been more than 
15 years since Congress has enacted 
comprehensive reform of the credit re-
porting system. 
In particular, I would like to focus on 
the consumers who have experienced fi-
nancial distress due to inaccurate in-
formation on their credit reports. 
When there is an error on a consumer 
report, the burden falls on the con-
sumer. It can take months and even, in 
some cases, years to remove an error 
on a consumer’s report, all the while 
the consumer’s credit continues to suf-
fer, potentially preventing them from 
receiving a much-needed loan or fi-
nancing. 
b 1345 
My bill, the Improving Credit Report-
ing for All Consumers Act, which is 
part of this larger package, would help 
consumers by making it easier for in-
correct information to be removed 
swiftly and painlessly. 
It would make much-needed improve-
ments to the dispute process for con-
sumers by providing a new right to ap-
peal the results of initial disputes.

It would also require furnishers to re-
tain better records of negative infor-
mation and that consumers be provided 
copies of any documents used during 
the dispute process. All furnishers who 
regularly report negative information 
would also be required to notify cus-
tomers about this practice and alert 
customers when they first send deroga-
tory information. 
The second portion of my bill pro-
hibits credit reporting agencies from 
providing consumers with misleading 
and unfair information about the var-
ious credit monitoring services they 
offer. 
Credit reporting agencies would also 
be prohibited from misleading con-
sumers by describing certain products 
and services as free that are, in truth, 
provided at no charge only for a lim-
ited trial period before automatically 
converting into a paid subscription 
service. 
The naysayers will say that my bill 
is 
well-meaning 
but 
significantly 
flawed because the dispute process 
would make things more complicated 
and difficult, but they would be wrong. 
The status quo is difficult and cum-
bersome, and too many consumers’ 
lives, credit, and opportunities for 
healthy financial records hang in the 
balance. 
Credit scores have a significant bear-
ing on your ability to secure access to 
loans and other opportunities for up-
ward economic mobility. This is an 
issue far too important, life-altering, 
and impactful. We must do all that we 
can to ensure that consumers are fully 
knowledgeable about their options and 
that they have the necessary protec-
tions available to them. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to support this bold package. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS), my colleague 
from Weatherford. 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 3621. 
As a business owner and lender, I 
know firsthand the value that com-
plete and accurate credit reports have 
in making sound business decisions. 
For any business that relies on fi-
nancing, risk-based pricing is essential 
in order to offer each customer the 
lowest rate possible. Every time a deal 
is broken, the cost gets passed along to 
the next customer. 
Your handshake is worth something. 
When you are trying to get a loan, peo-
ple need to know that your signature is 
worth something as well. 
In Texas, a deal is a deal, and you 
must always live up to your end of the 
bargain. For those customers who have 
been financially responsible and always 
paid their debts on time, they are re-
warded with lower rates. For those bor-
rowers who have not paid their debts 
on time, financial institutions are 
forced to price in this inherent risk. 
Whether a person is buying a car, a 
private jet, or a cow, the lender needs 
to be paid back in order to be able to 
continue offering lines of credit to re-
sponsible people in their community. 
Mr. Chair, I am concerned that this 
bill would take us down a path where 
lenders are receiving incomplete credit 
reports that have been scrubbed of all 
negative information. In other words, 
hiding information results in greater 
risk for the lender. This would make 
borrowing money more expensive for 
all customers since financial institu-
tions will have a worse picture about 
who will be able to repay their debts 
and who will not. 
Again, I remind you we say and al-
ways should remember: A deal is a 
deal. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, our next 
speaker is a sponsor of one of the bills 
in H.R. 3621. She will have an oppor-
tunity to correct the ranking member, 
who indicated the bill would remove 
negative credit after 2 years. It does 
not. She will clear that up and make 
sure that he understands the facts of 
our bill. 
Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, I thank Chair-
woman WATERS
and her intelligent, 
hardworking staff for their leadership 
on this bill. 
I also thank my sister-in-service, 
Congresswoman AYANNA PRESSLEY, for 
spearheading this package of bills, the 
Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020. A 
new decade, a new way, as our chair-
woman would say. 
I am also proud that our package of 
bills before us today includes H.R. 3622, 
the Restoring Unfairly Impaired Credit 
and Protecting Consumers Act. We are 
all aware of how expensive medical 
bills are and how easily one sickness or 
accident can bring families to financial 
ruin. According to the Urban Institute, 
regardless of age, income, insurance 
status, or ethnicity, one in four indi-
viduals are at risk of losing their 
health, homes, credit standing, and fi-
nancial security annually because of 
the harms of medical debt. 
The bill prohibits the reporting of 
medically necessary debt often in-
curred for seeking lifesaving treatment 
and protects the credit profile of those 
struggling with medical debt by stop-
ping the credit reporting agency from 
reporting this debt for 1 year, twice the 
current practice. 
This bill also protects the survivors 
of financial abuse. A study by the Fed-
eral Trade Commission shows that 21 
percent of consumers had verified er-
rors in their credit report; 13 percent 
had errors that affected their credit 
scores; and 5 percent had errors serious 
enough to cause them to be denied or 
pay more for credit. 
Our bill would make sure that fellow 
Americans 
suffering 
from 
cir-
cumstances beyond their control are 
not punished or left out of future op-
portunities to responsibly build and re-
build credit because of risk factors be-
yond their control. 
By passing this bill, we will make it 
easier for our neighbors struggling to 
recover 
from 
predatory 
loans 
and 
fraudulent activity by requiring that 
credit reporting agencies remove nega-
tive information from credit reports 
relating to loans that are unfair, decep-
tive, abusive, and otherwise illegal. 
Lastly, and probably the most trans-
formative provision, this bill shortens 
the length of time that bad marks stay 
on your credit report from 7 years to 4 
years. 
This package will open up doors for 
economic opportunities for millions of 
people across our country. No one 
should be stopped from becoming a 
homeowner or bettering their life be-
cause of bad debt. 
Mr. Chair, that is why I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mr. LYNCH), who is chair-
man of the Task Force on Financial 
Technology, and a sponsor of H.R. 3629, 
one of the bills that is making up this 
package. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the gentlewoman from California for 
her longtime leadership on this issue. I 
also thank my colleague, Ms. PRESSLEY 
from Massachusetts, for her work as 
well. 
I am extremely grateful that the text 
of my bill, H.R. 3629, the Clarity in 
Credit Score Formation Act, which 
would require the Consumer Financial 
Protection 
Bureau 
to 
periodically 
evaluate the models and underlying al-
gorithms used to measure consumer 
creditworthiness, has been made part 
of this measure. 
I also appreciate the opportunity to 
speak in favor of my colleague’s work, 
which is embodied in H.R. 3621, the 
Comprehensive CREDIT Act, which is 
before us today. 
Mr. Chair, as we have heard through-
out debate, credit reports and credit 
scores are an important part of Amer-
ican consumers’ financial lives. Yet, 
despite that importance, we continue 
to see serious problems with the way 
creditworthiness is measured and with 
the credit models that the credit agen-
cies use. 
We know that consumers have con-
sistently faced errors in their credit re-
ports and that, oftentimes, those errors 
are serious enough to impact impor-
tant opportunities in obtaining hous-
ing and other major financial deci-
sions. These errors can lead directly to 
consumers being denied credit or pay-
ing substantially more for the credit 
that they do receive. 
Despite complaints from my Repub-
lican colleagues, by expanding the pool 
of information used to make credit de-
cisions, applicants and lenders actually 
won’t have to rely solely on often- 
flawed data in credit reports, and con-
sumers can get the credit they deserve 
for regularly paying their rent on time 
and their bills on time and more, with-
out raising the cost to the system of 
doing so.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H658 
January 29, 2020 
While these new uses of data can 
allow expanded access to credit, some-
times that same data can be mis-
construed and result in unfair discrimi-
nation. We have seen this most clearly 
in the credit scores of our sons and 
daughters in uniform and military per-
sonnel in the Armed Forces. 
It is customary that service to our 
Nation requires military families to 
move around fairly frequently as de-
ployments 
and 
unit 
assignments 
change. Taken by itself and out of con-
text, frequently moving your residence 
year to year can give the false impres-
sion to a credit agency that an appli-
cant is not in a stable situation and 
can adversely impact their ability to 
access credit. 
Other uses of data can be closely re-
lated to factors such as race or gender, 
or become a proxy for a protected 
class. 
We have already seen examples of 
this. The Department of Housing and 
Urban Development has sued Facebook 
over its use of data-targeting, which 
violates the Fair Housing Act by ad-
versely stereotyping families who live 
in public housing projects. Even Hous-
ing Secretary Carson has openly stat-
ed: 
‘‘Facebook 
is 
discriminating 
against people based upon who they are 
and where they live.’’ 
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts. 
Mr. LYNCH. These charges followed 
on the heels of charges that Facebook 
entered into a financial settlement 
after accusations that landlords, lend-
ers, and employers improperly used 
that platform to unfairly discriminate 
against families seeking housing op-
portunities. 
That is why we need clarity in credit 
score formation. That is why we need 
this bill. 
Importantly, with the expansion of 
mobile banking, it requires a study on 
the impact of using nontraditional 
data on consumer reports and the use 
of alternative data in credit scoring 
models. 
Much to Chairwoman WATERS’ and 
Ms. PRESSLEY’s credit, this is a very 
good bill that will help us harness the 
power of mobile technology and alter-
native data to improve outcomes for 
consumers. 
Mr. Chair, in closing, I thank my col-
leagues, Mr. LAWSON of Florida, Mrs. 
BEATTY of Ohio, Ms. PRESSLEY of Mas-
sachusetts, Ms. TLAIB of Michigan, and 
Ms. ADAMS of North Carolina for their 
great contribution, along with Chair-
woman WATERS, in making this suc-
cessful legislation. 
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, I submit for the 
RECORD page 114 of the bill, and I would 
highlight these sections, line 4, ‘‘Main-
tenance of Credit Scores.’’ 
‘‘Subsection A: In General. All con-
sumer credit reporting agencies shall 
maintain the consumer’s file credit 
scores relating to the consumer for a 
period of 2 years from the date on 
which such information is generated. 
‘‘Subsection B: Disclosure Only to 
Consumers. A past credit score main-
tained in a consumer’s file pursuant to 
subparagraph A may only be provided 
to the consumer to which the credit 
score relates and may not be included 
in a consumer report or used as a fac-
tor in generating a credit score or edu-
cational credit score. 
‘‘Subsection C: Removal of the Past 
Credit Scores. A past credit score 
maintained in a consumer’s file pursu-
ant to subparagraph A shall be re-
moved from the consumer’s file after 
the end of the 2-year period described 
under subparagraph A.’’ 
This is the section of the bill that 
says that your consumer credit report 
can only be 2 years old—your score. 
Now, the data can be longer, but your 
score can only use 2 years of past data. 
That is deeply problematic because, 
as we know, these things are more 
long-run occurrences. Creditworthiness 
doesn’t happen overnight, nor do some-
body’s riskier habits happen overnight. 
So for a 2-year period, we have not 
seen any testimony why 2 years is suf-
ficient. The current industry standard 
is much longer than that, but each dif-
ferent user of this credit information 
can determine for themselves what 
that appropriate time is, and that is 
not mandated by current law. 
b 1400 
So I find this troublesome, and prob-
lematic, and riskier than what we cur-
rently have in the law; and that is one 
of the components of this bill that I op-
pose. There are numerous other exam-
ples, but I know we will have more de-
bate and I will be able to bring up 
those exact details as those on the 
other side tout the so-called benefits. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. LAWSON), who is the sponsor of 
H.R. 3614, one of the bills in this com-
prehensive package. 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise to support H.R. 3621, a bill 
that provides strong consumer protec-
tion for our Nation’s borrowers. 
Often, we talk about access to capital 
and how many communities across this 
country are either underbanked or shut 
out of the credit market altogether. 
This bill goes further than any other 
piece of legislation we have seen in 
protecting our Nation’s student loan 
borrowers, potential hires from biased 
credit reporting, and guaranteeing that 
consumers have the necessary informa-
tion to make informed financial deci-
sions. 
I am particularly thankful that this 
legislation includes my bill, H.R. 3614, 
that will limit the use of credit reports 
and credit scores to make hiring deci-
sions. 
As with access to capital, there are 
many barriers in accessing employ-
ment opportunities, particularly for 
communities 
of 
color 
and 
other 
marginalized groups based on several 
factors. One of these factors includes 
an individual’s credit history. 
Many people have fallen on hard 
times, had their identities stolen, or 
have become ill, which have negatively 
impacted their credit reports. But I 
ask, should that also impact their abil-
ity to become employed? 
Should an arbitrary number based on 
obscure algorithms that make up a 
credit score shut someone out of being 
employed? The answer is no. 
That is why this bill prohibits cer-
tain employers from using credit his-
tory to determine someone’s eligibility 
to be employed. This bill is a much- 
needed solution in removing employ-
ment barriers. 
As we move forward, I will continue 
to work with stakeholders to protect 
job applicants while also guaranteeing 
that organizations and companies can 
vet potential applicants adequately. 
Mr. Chairman, I thank Congress-
woman 
PRESSLEY, 
Chairwoman 
WATERS, and the committee staff who 
have worked tirelessly into the night 
to help draft this bill. I thank them for 
their advocacy on behalf of the Na-
tion’s consumers. 
It is about time we help people gain 
greater access to the job market. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY), 
who is the chairwoman of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I thank the chair-
woman for yielding and for being such 
a leader on this issue and so many oth-
ers. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 3621, 
and I want to thank my colleague, Ms. 
PRESSLEY, for her hard work on this 
bill. 
Our credit reporting system is deeply 
flawed, and it affects millions of con-
sumers every day. When there is an 
error on a consumer’s credit report, it 
can harm their credit for years. Maybe 
their credit report says that they 
didn’t pay a bill when they did, or 
maybe they confused them with an-
other person. 
These kinds of basic errors should be 
easy to fix, but unfortunately, they 
often take years to sort out. And in the 
meantime, consumers are being wrong-
fully denied credit or paying higher 
rates than they should. 
This bill will solve these problems by 
reforming the dispute process in order 
to give consumers more rights and 
more opportunities to challenge bad in-
formation on their credit reports. 
It also helps consumers who have 
burdensome student loans by removing 
negative credit information as soon as 
they can demonstrate that they have a 
history of timely repayment. This is 
incredibly important. 
Finally, I want to thank Chairwoman 
WATERS for her tireless efforts on this

ing for years, and I am very proud she 
was able to shepherd so many bills to 
the floor. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I would 
like to inquire, through the Chair, if 
my colleague has any remaining speak-
ers on his side. 
I have no further speakers and I am 
prepared to close. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I include in the RECORD three docu-
ments in opposition to this bill. The 
first is a letter to Chairwoman WATERS 
and to me from the Consumer Data In-
dustry Association expressing their op-
position to this bill. 
CONSUMER DATA INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, January 23, 2020. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, Chairwoman, 
Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY, Ranking Member, 
Committee on Financial Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS
AND RANKING 
MEMBER MCHENRY: On behalf of the Con-
sumer Data Industry Association (CDIA), I 
want to share our opposition to H.R. 3621, 
the ‘‘Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020.’’ 
This approximately 200-page bill would im-
pose new costs to consumers and the econ-
omy and negatively impact credit under-
writing standards. We request that House 
Members vote no when the bill is considered. 
As the trade association representing com-
panies who provide consumer reporting serv-
ices, we and our members strive to ensure 
that consumer credit reports are accurate, 
the information within them is protected 
and consumers are empowered to correct in-
accurate 
information 
in 
a 
timely 
and 
straightforward fashion. Our member compa-
nies work constantly to improve the con-
sumer reporting system by making tech-
nology and process improvements to enhance 
accuracy and improve the consumer experi-
ence. 
OVERVIEW 
The negative outcomes of H.R. 3621 would 
strike consumers, community banks, credit 
unions, automobile dealers, mortgage lend-
ers, other non-bank lenders, data furnishers, 
employees and employers, insurers, property 
owners and consumer reporting agencies 
(CRAs). This legislation makes extensive and 
complicated changes to the consumer report-
ing industry and the rights and obligations 
established under the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act (FCRA), and will affect the entire credit 
allocation and risk management ecosystem; 
the bill is not solely targeted at CRAs. 
In previous instances when Congress con-
sidered major FCRA changes, extensive hear-
ings were held in the House and Senate, fea-
turing consumers, regulators, the consumer 
reporting industry, data contributors and 
end users of credit reports, such as banks and 
retailers. In the past, this has resulted in 
legislation that was supported by most 
stakeholders and bi-partisan Congressional 
majorities. The legislation in this Congress 
was taken up by Committee after only a sin-
gle hearing last February, which was not fo-
cused on specific legislative issues. We be-
lieve proceeding without additional scrutiny 
is a mistake, given the bill’s complexity and 
its impact. 
Consumer reports are a critical driver of 
economic growth and opportunity. Our econ-
omy relies on the ability of CRAs to interact 
with lenders, employers, insurers and others 
to enable consumers to access low-cost cred-
it, employment opportunities and housing. 
The Federal Reserve noted, for example, that 
‘‘[a]vailable evidence indicates that [credit 
report] data and the credit-scoring models 
derived from them have substantially im-
proved the overall quality of credit decisions 
and have reduced the costs of such decision- 
making. Almost certainly, consumers would 
receive less credit and the price of the credit 
they received would be higher, if not for the 
information provided by credit reporting 
companies.’’ Current law provides consumers 
with a robust set of protections and rights. 
Ongoing debates regarding consumer privacy 
have shown that many, including consumer 
advocates, identify the FCRA as an example 
of effective consumer protection legislation 
and a model for other segments of the econ-
omy. 
In 2010, Congress passed the Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- 
Frank Act), which established the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). That 
law gave CFPB authority over much of the 
consumer reporting system, and since then, 
oversight by the Bureau has resulted in sig-
nificant improvements within the consumer 
reporting system; CRAs, furnishers and users 
of credit reports have adopted multiple 
changes increasing consumer report accu-
racy and improving the consumer dispute 
process. 
If H.R. 3621 were to become law, consumers 
who pay their bills on time and manage their 
debts responsibly will pay more for credit 
than they do today. Consumers who have 
faced challenges with their credit will be 
worse off as well, as banks will lose the abil-
ity to accurately judge their credit history 
because key information will no longer ap-
pear on reports. The economy will suffer, as 
credit decisions will be based on fewer facts, 
and lenders will be forced to increase prices 
or reduce the amount of consumer credit 
available. 
The legislation to be considered was passed 
by the Committee on Financial Services as 
six bills, now embodied in H.R. 3621. We com-
municated our concerns in a letter on July 6, 
2019. Those concerns continue to be valid; 
the following highlights some of the con-
cerns we raised then. 
Mr. MCHENRY. The second document 
is a letter to Members of the House of 
Representatives expressing opposition 
to each of the bills that was included in 
this overarching bill, including opposi-
tion to: H.R. 3621, H.R. 3614, H.R. 3618, 
H.R. 3622, H.R. 3642, from the United 
States Chamber of Commerce. 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
January 27, 2020. 
TO
THE MEMBERS
OF
THE U.S. HOUSE
OF 
REPRESENTATIVES: The U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce strongly opposes H.R. 3621, the 
‘‘Comprehensive Credit Act of 2020,’’ which is 
composed of a number of bills regarding 
credit reporting that were reported out of 
the House Financial Services Committee in 
2019. 
The Chamber has previously expressed op-
position to each of the bills below which are 
now included as part of this comprehensive 
package: 
H.R. 3621, the ‘‘Student Borrower Credit 
Improvement Act,’’ would arbitrarily re-
move repayment information regarding stu-
dent loans issued by private lenders. Reduc-
ing the quality of information in credit re-
ports would in the aggregate reduce their 
utility, making it more difficult for con-
sumers to access credit or other services. 
H.R. 3614, the ‘‘Restricting Use of Credit 
Checks for Employment Decisions Act,’’ 
would restrict an employer from initiating a 
credit check of an employee despite the fact 
that the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires 
an employee to first provide consent. This 
legislation would make it more difficult for 
employers to review the backgrounds of pro-
spective employees, which would make it 
more difficult to hire for sensitive positions 
or would otherwise delay the hiring process. 
H.R. 3618, the ‘‘Free Credit Scores for Con-
sumers Act,’’ would require credit bureaus to 
pay for and disclose for free a credit scoring 
model that is owned by a third party. Credit 
bureaus already provide ample information 
to consumers at no charge to assist them 
with understanding their credit standing. 
The legislation would make it more difficult 
for credit bureaus to provide for the accurate 
flow of useful information between con-
sumers, furnishers, and entities that need to 
make informed decisions. 
H.R. 3622, the ‘‘Restoring Unfairly Im-
paired Credit and Protecting Consumers 
Act,’’ would reduce the quality of credit re-
ports by arbitrarily reducing the term of ad-
verse information and instituting redundant 
remediation mechanisms. Disrupting the 
utility of information in credit reports would 
make it more difficult for credit providers, 
and nonfinancial entities such as tele-
communications companies and utilities to 
efficiently provide their services to con-
sumers. 
H.R. 3642, the ‘‘Improving Credit Reporting 
for All Consumers Act,’’ would create dis-
pute resolution requirements that are redun-
dant to services voluntarily provided by 
credit bureaus and existing requirements 
under both the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
and a recent agreement among 38 State At-
torneys General. Additionally, the legisla-
tion would frustrate the ability of credit bu-
reaus to provide information to consumers 
by imposing new restrictions on the mar-
keting of products intended to improve cred-
it standing. 
H.R. 3629, the ‘‘Clarity in Credit Score For-
mation Act of 2019,’’ would make the CFPB, 
not lenders, the de facto underwriter of con-
sumer loans and is redundant to existing su-
pervisory and regulatory authority. The 
CFPB currently supervises larger partici-
pants in consumer reporting under its au-
thority in the Dodd-Frank Act and has broad 
regulatory authority via enforcement of the 
Fair Credit Reporting Act. Interference in 
the proprietary models developed by credit 
bureaus and used by lenders would increase 
lenders’ risk and decrease their ability to 
provide objective information. 
The Chamber urges you to oppose the Com-
prehensive Credit Act. 
Sincerely, 
NEIL L. BRADLEY. 
Mr. MCHENRY. And finally, I include 
in the RECORD Statement of Adminis-
tration Policy that says that the Presi-
dent would veto this bill. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 3621—COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT ACT OF 2020— 
REP. PRESSLEY, D–MA, AND REP. OCASIO-COR-
TEZ, D–NY 
The Administration opposes passage of 
H.R. 3621, the Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 
2020. The Administration supports measures 
to increase access to affordable consumer 
credit, but H.R. 3621 would do the opposite by 
reducing the efficiency of consumer lending 
markets and raising the cost of consumer 
credit. 
H.R. 3621 would preclude credit reporting 
agencies from incorporating a range of rel-
evant data into consumer reports, which 
would reduce their predictive value and raise 
borrowing costs for responsible borrowers. 
This legislation would also prevent the Fed-
eral Government from reporting information 
regarding debts arising out of criminal mon-
etary 
penalties. 
Additionally, 
H.R. 
3621

January 29, 2020 
would empower the Bureau of Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection to control the develop-
ment of credit-scoring models, which would 
hinder market competition that drives inno-
vation and improves modeling. Finally, this 
legislation would interfere with the ability 
of employers, including executive branch 
agencies, to make reasonable background in-
vestigation determinations with respect to 
candidates for sensitive positions. 
If H.R. 3621 were presented to the Presi-
dent, his senior advisors would recommend 
that he veto it. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I 
might offer to the chair of the com-
mittee at some point to frame the 
Statement of Administration Policy on 
vetoes of some of her bills this Con-
gress. That may be a badge of honor. I 
say that in a lighthearted manner, not 
in an aggressive way, for sure. 
Mr. Chairman, in closing, this is a 
partisan bill under the guise of con-
sumer protection that will destroy the 
accuracy and completeness of con-
sumer credit files. 
Moreover, this bill continues the 
Democrats’ trend of failing to address 
the underlying causes of the student 
loan crisis; the underlying causes of 
medical debt; the underlying causes of 
homelessness. 
Instead, this bill will jeopardize cred-
it for low and middle-income Ameri-
cans 
disproportionately; 
Americans 
who fight to pay their bills each 
month; make good on their obligations; 
and have taken the time to improve 
their financial situations over time and 
become eligible for credit. 
What my colleagues fail to under-
stand is this: This bill will weaken un-
derwriting standards. That strikes at 
safety and soundness. It will make ex-
tending credit riskier and more expen-
sive for consumers, ultimately impact-
ing both the costs and accessibility of 
credit for all Americans. 
This bill alters the very foundation 
for extending credit in our financial 
system which is the ability to assess 
risk. 
This bill will drive us to a riskier fi-
nancial situation and financial system. 
It is a bad bill. 
This bill that we are considering 
today will fundamentally alter the way 
credit is extended in this country, and 
not for the better. 
So let’s be clear on what this bill 
does. It socializes credit modeling and 
reporting. 
This bill gives the CFPB the ability 
to develop, maintain, and regulate 
credit modeling and factors used in 
analysis. 
This bill prevents employers from 
knowing the creditworthiness of em-
ployees. 
This bill is a giveaway to trial attor-
neys, creating four new re-investiga-
tion and appeals processes to be ex-
ploited by the trial bar. 
This bill will make it more difficult 
for private lenders to compete in the 
student loan industry dominated by 
the Federal Government by allowing 
delinquent borrowers or borrowers who 
have defaulted on a loan to make 
changes to their credit outside of the 
contractual obligations and contrac-
tual terms they have agreed to. 
As I said earlier, bipartisan com-
promise was within reach. All my col-
leagues had to do was reach out and 
grab it. Instead, they chose to push 
through another partisan bill that is 
going nowhere in the Senate and will 
be vetoed—if it were to even make it 
through the United States Senate—ve-
toed by the President. 
And this has been a tremendous 
waste of time for the American people, 
a tremendous waste of time, when we 
have very important issues to wrestle 
with as a Congress and as a country. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on socializing credit reporting. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a 
letter from the Americans for Finan-
cial Reform and the 85 undersigned 
consumer, civil rights, labor, and com-
munity organizations who wrote to ex-
press their support for H.R. 3621, and a 
letter from the National Association of 
Realtors. 
AMERICANS FOR FINANCIAL REFORM, 
January 27, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The 85 undersigned 
consumer, civil rights, labor, and community 
organizations write to express our support 
for HR 3621, the Comprehensive Credit Re-
porting Enhancement, Disclosure, Innova-
tion, and Transparency Act of 2020 (Com-
prehensive CREDIT Act of 2020). 
Credit reports and credit scores play a crit-
ical role in the economic lives of Americans. 
They are the gatekeeper for affordable cred-
it, insurance, rental housing, and sometimes 
unfortunately even a job. Yet they suffer 
from unacceptable rates of inaccuracy. This 
bill would enact a sea change that would 
make the American credit reporting system 
more accurate and fairer to consumers. 
The Federal Trade Commission’s definitive 
study showed that 21% of consumers had 
verified errors in their credit reports, 13% 
had errors that affected their credit scores, 
and 5% had errors serious enough to cause 
them to be denied or pay more for credit. 
Trying to fix these errors can be a Kafka- 
esque nightmare in which the Big Three na-
tionwide consumer report agencies (CRAs)— 
Equifax, Experian and TransUnion—consist-
ently favor the side of the creditor or debt 
collector (‘‘the furnisher’’) over the con-
sumer. 
The American credit reporting systems 
suffers from a number of other flaws and de-
fects. Consumers are unfairly penalized by 
negative credit reporting when they have 
been the victim of abusive practices, such as 
predatory mortgages or student loans result-
ing from for-profit school fraud, or due to 
circumstances out of their control, such as 
temporary job loss, illness, or financial 
abuse by a family member. Healthcare bills 
contribute greatly to credit reporting harms, 
with over 50% of debt collection items re-
sulting from medical debt. 
Consumers also lack the right to a free an-
nual credit score. Furthermore, many con-
sumers who attempt to obtain a free annual 
credit report or to obtain their scores are 
misled into purchasing high-priced credit 
monitoring or other subscription services. 
These services are also marketed to prevent 
identify theft, yet they are far less effective 
in doing so than a security freeze. This legis-
lation comprehensively addresses all of these 
abuses, and more. This bill would: 
Fix the broken system for credit reporting 
disputes by (1) giving consumers a new right 
to appeal the results of initial disputes; (2) 
requiring CRAs and furnishers of informa-
tion to dedicate sufficient resources and pro-
vide well-trained personnel to handle dis-
putes; (3) requiring CRAs to conduct an inde-
pendent analysis of disputes, separate from 
that of the furnisher; and (4) requiring fur-
nishers to retain records for the same time 
period that negative information remains on 
reports. 
Improve credit reporting accuracy by di-
recting the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau (CFPB) to establish accuracy regula-
tions, including requiring CRAs to better 
monitor furnishers for high error rates and 
to use stricter criteria to match information 
from a lender to a consumer’s file, pre-
venting the worst type of credit reporting 
error, the ‘‘mixed file.’’ 
Restrict the use of credit information for 
employment by limiting it to two narrow in-
stances—when required by local, state or fed-
eral law or for national security clearances. 
This will severely limit a practice that dis-
criminates against the long-term unem-
ployed, has a disparate impact on commu-
nities of color, and has very little evidence 
demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting 
job performance. 
Help victims of abusive lending and overly 
punitive negative reporting practices by (1) 
reducing the current overlong retention peri-
ods that adverse credit information remains 
on reports to four years (seven years for 
bankruptcies); (2) allowing borrowers victim-
ized by the unfair, deceptive or abusive prac-
tices of mortgage lenders or servicers to 
have adverse mortgage-related information 
removed; and (3) requiring the removal of 
negative information about private edu-
cation loans that were obtained to attend 
for-profit colleges found to have engaged in 
unfair or deceptive practices. 
Protect consumers from the unfair impact 
of medical debt by prohibiting CRAs from in-
cluding medical collections on reports until 
365 days from the date of first delinquency 
and prohibiting the reporting of any debt for 
medically necessary procedures. This will 
ensure that consumers have time to resolve 
their complex, confusing medical bills. The 
bill also mandates that all paid or settled 
debt, including medical collections, be re-
moved within 45 days from reports. 
Help consumers understand their credit-
worthiness by giving consumers the right to 
a free credit score at the same time that 
they obtain their free annual consumer re-
port. The bill also creates several new in-
stances in which consumers are entitled to 
receive both free reports and scores, includ-
ing requiring auto, private education and 
mortgage lenders to provide prospective loan 
borrowers the same free reports and scores 
that the lenders used in their decision-mak-
ing before consumers sign those loan agree-
ments. 
Address misleading marketing of credit 
monitoring subscriptions and increase access 
for security freezes to prevent identity theft 
by (1) prohibiting the misleading practice of 
automatically converting free trial periods 
into paid, monthly subscription services by 
requiring CRAs to provide explicit opt-ins at 
the end of the promotions and (2) providing 
free credit freezes for security breach vic-
tims and vulnerable consumers, and capping 
the cost for all other consumers. 
Give a second chance to struggling private 
education loan borrowers by allowing them 
to 
rehabilitate 
impaired 
credit 
records 
through requiring removal of adverse infor-
mation about delinquent or defaulted loans 
if they are able to make nine out of ten on- 
time, monthly payments.

DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS
AND RANKING 
MEMBER MCHENRY: On behalf of the 1.4 mil-
lion members of the National Association of 
REALTORS® (NAR), NAR is pleased to sup-
port H.R. 3621, the ‘‘Comprehensive Credit 
Act of 2020.’’ 
Nearly 70 percent of home sales are fi-
nanced and a borrower’s credit report and 
credit score form a critical gateway to ob-
taining a mortgage. Unfortunately, inac-
curate credit reports and unfair credit re-
porting methods raise the cost and/or limit 
access to mortgage credit for many prospec-
tive borrowers. To this end, NAR applauds 
H.R. 3621, the ‘‘Comprehensive Credit Act of 
2020,’’ which include the following bills. 
H.R. 3618, the ‘‘Free Credit Scores for Con-
sumers Act of 2019’’ 
H.R. 3621, the ‘‘Student Borrower Credit 
Improvement Act’’ 
H.R. 3622, the ‘‘Restoring Unfairly Im-
paired Credit and Protecting Consumers 
Act’’ 
H.R. 3642, the ‘‘Improving Credit Reporting 
for All Consumers Act’’ 
H.R. 3629, the ‘‘Clarity in Credit Score For-
mation Act of 2019’’ 
REALTORS® believe that balanced finan-
cial regulation and appropriate consumer 
protection will result in a more vibrant 
housing market and overall economy. Fur-
thermore, creditor and consumer confidence 
is critical in the home financing process. RE-
ALTORS® thank you for your diligent work 
to improve the accuracy, consistency, and 
availability of quality credit scoring and ap-
praisal information. 
Sincerely, 
VINCE MALTA, 
2020 President, National Association 
of REALTORS®. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, first, I 
would like to thank all of the partici-
pants in this comprehensive package. I 
would like to thank Ms. PRESSLEY, as 
the sponsor of this comprehensive piece 
of legislation, Mr. LAWSON, Ms. ADAMS, 
Mrs. BEATTY, Mr. LYNCH, and Ms. 
TLAIB, for all of the work that they put 
in to ensure that we were covering the 
years of complaints that we have got-
ten about our credit bureaus and the 
mishandling of our consumers and a 
lack of protection for consumers who 
have suffered at the hands of our credit 
bureaus who did not take into consid-
eration these very serious complaints. 
So, Mr. Chairman, the Comprehen-
sive Credit Reporting Enhancement, 
Disclosure, 
Innovation, 
and 
Trans-
parency, this act, makes much-needed 
and overdue reforms to improve the 
credit reporting system. The issues ad-
dressed by this bill are important for 
the economic well-being of millions of 
Americans and our economy. 
As we have discussed, the bill is sup-
ported by, again, Americans for Finan-
cial Reform, the National Association 
of Consumer Advocates, and the Na-
tional Association of Realtors. So, with 
all of this support, and with consumers 
who have been waiting for years for 
their Representatives to do something 
about the fact that their data is all in 
the hands of these credit bureaus who 
are determining whether or not they 
can acquire credit; whether or not they 
are going to be able to get a loan; 
whether or not they are going to be 
able to have a decent quality of life be-
cause they have done everything that 
they could do to have good credit; and 
that when they have said to the credit 
bureaus, there is an error, they have 
got me mixed up with someone else, 
and they cannot get this straightened 
out for them, and they suffer. 
So the time has come, and I am so 
very pleased that my committee is an-
swering all of the requests from our 
constituents and your constituents and 
all of the constituents of Representa-
tives in this body, to do something. 
The time is now, and we are doing that. 
This comprehensive piece of legislation 
will absolutely deal with these con-
cerns that have been identified for so 
long. 
I urge all Members who care about 
their constituency, who have been 
hearing these issues for so many years, 
I urge them to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. PAYNE). All 
time for general debate has expired. 
In lieu of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on Financial Services, 
printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of 
the text of Rules Committee Print 116– 
47, modified by the amendment printed 
in part A of House Report 116–383, shall 
be considered as adopted. The bill, as 
amended, shall be considered as an 
original bill for purpose of further 
amendment under the 5-minute rule, 
and shall be considered as read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) GENERAL FINDINGS ON CREDIT REPORTING.— 
(A) Consumer reporting agencies (‘‘CRAs’’) 
are companies that collect, compile, and provide 
information about consumers in the form of con-
sumer reports for certain permissible statutory 
purposes under the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
(15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) (‘‘FCRA’’). The three 
largest CRAs in this country are Equifax, 
TransUnion, and Experian. These CRAs are re-
ferred to as nationwide CRAs and the reports 
that they prepare are commonly referred to as 
credit reports. Furnishers, such as creditors, 
lenders, and debt collection agencies, volun-
tarily submit information to CRAs about their 
accounts such as the total amount for each loan 
or credit limit for each credit card and the con-
sumer’s payment history on these products. Re-
ports also include identifying information about 
a consumer, such as their birthdate, previous 
mailing addresses, and current and previous em-
ployers. 
(B) In a December 2012 paper, ‘‘Key Dimen-
sions and Processes in the U.S. Credit Reporting 
System: A review for how the nation’s largest 
credit bureaus manage consumer data’’, the Bu-
reau of Consumer Financial Protection (‘‘Con-
sumer Bureau’’) noted that the three nation-
wide CRAs maintain credit files on approxi-
mately 200 million adults and receive informa-
tion from about 10,000 furnishers. On a monthly 
basis, these furnishers provide information on 
over 1.3 billion consumer credit accounts or 
other trade lines. 
(C) The 10 largest institutions furnishing cred-
it information to each of the nationwide CRAs 
account for more than half of all accounts re-
flected in consumers’ credit files. 
(D) Consumer reports play an increasingly im-
portant role in the lives of American consumers. 
Most creditors, for example, review these reports 
to make decisions about whether to extend cred-
it to consumers and what terms and conditions 
to offer them. As such, information contained in 
these reports affects whether a person is able to 
get a private education loan to pay for college 
costs, to secure a mortgage loan to buy a home, 
or to obtain a credit card, as well as the terms 
and conditions under which consumer credit 
products or services are offered to them. 
(E) Credit reports are also increasingly used 
for many noncredit decisions, including by 
landlords to determine whether to rent an 
apartment to a prospective tenant and by em-
ployers to decide whether to hire potential job 
applicants or to offer a promotion to existing 
employees. 
(F) CRAs have a statutory obligation to verify 
independently the accuracy and completeness of 
information included on the reports that they 
provide. 
(G) The nationwide CRAs have failed to es-
tablish and follow reasonable procedures, as re-
quired by existing law, to establish the max-
imum level of accuracy of information contained 
on consumer reports. Given the repeated failures 
of these CRAs to comply with accuracy require-
ments on their own, legislation is intended to 
provide them with detailed guidance improving 
the accuracy and completeness of information 
contained in consumer reports, including proce-
dures, policies, and practices that these CRAs 
should already be following to ensure full com-
pliance with their existing obligations. 
(H) The presence of inaccurate or incomplete 
information on these reports can result in sub-
stantial financial and emotional harm to con-
sumers. Credit reporting errors can lead to the 
loss of a new employment opportunity or a de-
nial of a promotion in an existing job, stop 
someone from being able to access credit on fa-
vorable terms, prevent a person from obtaining 
rental housing, or even trigger mental distress. 
(I) Current industry practices impose an un-
fair burden of proof on consumers trying to fix 
errors on their reports. 
(J) Consumer reports containing inaccurate or 
incomplete credit information also undermine 
the ability of creditors and lenders to effectively 
and accurately underwrite and price credit. 
(K) Recognizing that credit reporting affects 
the lives of almost all consumers in this country 
and that the consequences of errors on a con-
sumer report can be catastrophic for a con-
sumer, the Consumer Bureau began accepting 
consumer complaints about credit reporting in 
October 2012. 
(L) As of early December 2019, the Consumer 
Bureau has handled approximately 391,560 cred-
it reporting complaints about the top three 
CRAs, making credit reporting consistently in 
the top third most-complained-about subject 
matter on which the Consumer Bureau accepts 
consumer complaints. Incorrect information in 
reports and frustrations about burdensome and 
time-consuming process to disputing items is are 
consistently top reported concerns from con-
sumers. 
(M) Other common types of credit reporting 
complaints submitted to the Consumer Bureau 
related to the improper use of a report, trouble 
obtaining a report or credit score, CRAs’ inves-
tigations, and credit monitoring or identity pro-
tection. 
(N) In the fall 2019 ‘‘Supervisory Highlights’’, 
the Consumer Bureau noted that one or more of 
the largest CRAs continue to struggle to ade-
quately oversee furnishers to ensure that they 
were adhering to the CRA’s vetting policies and 
to establish proper procedures to verify public 
record information. 
(O) According to the fall 2016 ‘‘Supervisory 
Highlights’’, Consumer Bureau examiners deter-
mined that one or more debt collectors never in-
vestigated indirect disputes that lacked detail or 
were not accompanied by attachments with rel-
evant information from the consumer. Exam-
iners also found that notifications sent to con-
sumers about disputes considered frivolous 
failed to identify for the consumers the type of 
material that they could provide in order for the 
debt collector to complete the investigation of 
the disputed item. 
(P) A February 2014 Consumer Bureau report 
titled ‘‘Credit Reporting Complaint Snapshot’’ 
found that consumers are confused about the 
extent to which the nationwide CRAs are re-
quired to provide them with validation and doc-
umentation of a debt that appears on their cred-
it report. 
(Q) As evidence that the current system lacks 
sufficient market incentives for CRAs to develop 
more robust procedures to increase the accuracy 
and completeness of information on credit re-
ports, litigation discovery documented by the 
National Consumer Law Center (‘‘NCLC’’), as 
part of a February 2019 report titled ‘‘Auto-
mated Injustice Redux: Ten Years after a Key 
Report, Consumers Are Still Frustrated Trying 
to Fix Credit Reporting Errors’’, showed that at 
least two of the three largest CRAs use quota 
systems to force employees to process disputes

January 29, 2020 
hastily and without the opportunity for con-
ducting meaningful investigations. At least one 
nationwide CRA only allowed dispute resolution 
staff five minutes to handle a consumer’s call. 
Furthermore, these CRAs were found to have 
awarded bonuses for meeting quotas and pun-
ished those who didn’t meet production numbers 
with probation. 
(R) Unlike most other business relationships, 
where consumers can register their satisfaction 
or unhappiness with a particular credit product 
or service simply by taking their business else-
where, consumers have no say in whether their 
information is included in the CRAs databases 
and limited legal remedies to hold the CRAs ac-
countable for inaccuracies or poor service. 
(S) Accordingly, despite the existing statutory 
mandate for CRAs to follow reasonable proce-
dures to assure the maximum possible accuracy 
of the information whenever they prepare con-
sumer reports, numerous studies, the high vol-
ume of consumer complaints submitted to the 
Consumer Bureau about incorrect information 
on consumer reports, and supervisory activities 
by the Consumer Bureau demonstrate that 
CRAs continue to skirt their obligations under 
the law. 
(2) INCORRECT INFORMATION ON CONSUMER RE-
PORTS.— 
(A) Consumers are entitled to dispute errors 
on their consumer reports with either the CRA, 
who issued the report, or directly with fur-
nishers, who supplied the account information 
to the CRA, and request that mistakes be deleted 
or removed. Consumers, who believe an inves-
tigation has not correctly resolved their dispute, 
however, have few options, other than request-
ing that a statement about the dispute be in-
cluded with their future reports. 
(B) CRAs have a statutory obligation under 
the FCRA to perform a reasonable investigation 
by conducting a substantive and searching in-
quiry when a consumer disputes an item on 
their report. In doing so, CRAs must conduct an 
independent review about the accuracy of any 
disputed item and cannot merely rely on a fur-
nisher’s ‘‘rubber-stamp’’ verification of the in-
tegrity of the information they have provided to 
CRAs. 
(C) In ‘‘Report to Congress Under Section 319 
of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions 
Act of 2003’’ released by the Federal Government 
in December 2012, found that 26 percent of sur-
vey participants identified at least one poten-
tially material error on their consumer reports, 
and 13 percent experienced a change in their 
credit score once the error was fixed. 
(D) Consumer Bureau examiners have identi-
fied repeated deficiencies with the nationwide 
CRAs’ information collection. In the fall 2019 
‘‘Supervisory Highlights’’, the Consumer Bu-
reau noted continued weaknesses with CRAs’ 
methods and processes for assuring maximum 
possible accuracy in their reports. Examiners 
also found, with certain exceptions, no quality 
control policies and procedures in place to test 
consumer reports for accuracy. 
(E) In its ‘‘Credit Reporting Complaint Snap-
shot’’ released in February 2014, the Consumer 
Bureau found that consumers were uncertain 
about the depth and validity of the investiga-
tions performed about a disputed item. Con-
sumers also expressed frustration that, even 
though they provided supporting materials that 
they believed demonstrated the inaccuracy of 
the information provided by furnishers, errors 
continued to remain on their reports. 
(F) In the winter 2015 ‘‘Supervisory High-
lights’’ released in March 2015, the Consumer 
Bureau reported that one or more nationwide 
CRAs failed to adequately fulfill their dispute- 
handling obligations, including by not for-
warding to furnishers all relevant information 
found in letters and supporting documents sup-
plied by consumers when they submitted dis-
putes failing to notify consumers that they had 
completed investigations, and not providing con-
sumers with the results of the CRAs’ reviews 
about their disputes. 
(G) Consumer Bureau examiners also noted in 
the fall 2016 ‘‘Supervisory Highlights’’ released 
in October 2016 that one or more entities failed 
to provide adequate guidance and training to 
staff about how to differentiate FCRA disputes 
from general customer inquiries, complaints, or 
debt validation requests. Consumer Bureau su-
pervisors also directed one or more entities to de-
velop and implement reasonable procedures to 
ensure that direct and indirect disputes are ap-
propriately logged, categorized, and resolved. 
(H) Consumers’ increasing frustration about 
the difficulties of trying to fix credit reporting 
errors, evidenced through the volume of con-
sumer complaints related to errors submitted to 
the Consumer Bureau, are also echoed in an-
other Federal Government study issued in Janu-
ary 2015. In the ‘‘Report to Congress under Sec-
tion 319 for the Fair and Accurate Credit Trans-
actions Act of 2003’’, the study found that near-
ly 70 percent (84 people) of participants from a 
previous survey that had filed disputes with 
CRAs continued to believe that at least some of 
the disputed information remained inaccurate at 
the time of the follow-up survey. Despite these 
views, 50 percent (42 people) of the survey par-
ticipants decided to just give up trying to fix the 
errors, with only 45 percent (38 people) of them 
planning to continue to try to resolve their dis-
putes. 
(I) The consistently high volume of consumer 
complaints submitted to the Consumer Bureau 
about credit reporting errors, coupled with the 
largest CRAs’ repeated quality control weak-
nesses found by Consumer Bureau examiners, 
show that the nationwide CRAs have failed to 
establish and follow reasonable procedures to 
assure maximum accuracy of information and to 
conduct independent investigations of con-
sumers’ disputes. These ongoing problems dem-
onstrate the need for legislation to— 
(i) enhance obligations on furnishers to sub-
stantiate information and require furnishers to 
keep records for the same amount of time that 
adverse information about these accounts may 
appear on a person’s consumer report; 
(ii) eliminate CRAs’ discretion to determine 
the relevancy of materials provided by con-
sumers to support their dispute claims by in-
stead requiring them to pass all material onto 
furnishers and eliminating CRA’s discretion to 
deem some disputes frivolous or irrelevant when 
a consumer resubmits a claim that they believe 
has been inadequately resolved; 
(iii) enhance educational content on CRAs’ 
websites to improve consumers’ understanding 
of the dispute process and to make it easier for 
all consumers to initiate claims, including by 
providing these disclosures in other languages 
besides English; and 
(iv) create a new consumer right to appeal re-
views by CRAs and furnishers of the initial dis-
putes. 
(3) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.— 
(A) Despite the fact that the FCRA currently 
provides implicit authority for injunctive relief, 
consumers have been prevented from exercising 
this right against CRAs. Legislation explicitly 
clarifying this right is intended to underscore 
congressional 
intent 
that 
injunctive 
relief 
should be viewed as a remedy available to con-
sumers. 
(B) Myriad findings by the courts, regulators, 
consumers, and consumer advocates make clear 
that CRAs have failed to establish adequate 
standards for the accuracy and completeness of 
consumer reports, yet the nationwide CRAs 
have demonstrated little willingness to volun-
tarily retool their policies and procedures to fix 
the problems. 
(C) Providing courts with explicit authority to 
issue injunctive relief, by telling the CRAs to 
remedy unlawful practices and procedures, 
would further CRAs’ mandate under the FCRA 
to assure the maximum possible accuracy and 
completeness of information contained on credit 
reports. 
(D) Absent explicit authority to issue injunc-
tions, history suggests that the nationwide 
CRAs are likely to continue conducting business 
as usual in treating any monetary settlements 
with individual consumers and fines imposed by 
State attorneys general and Federal regulators, 
simply as the ‘‘cost of doing business’’. 
(4) CREDIT SCORES.— 
(A) While nationwide CRAs are required by 
law to supply consumers with a free copy of 
their credit report annually, they can charge 
consumers to obtain a credit score disclosure. 
(B) Many consumers do not realize that they 
have more than just ‘‘one’’ credit score. Because 
the submission of credit information to CRAs is 
voluntary and not all furnishers submit infor-
mation to every CRA, the information contained 
in a report also varies among CRAs. As a result, 
the credit score generated by each CRA is also 
likely to vary, resulting in potentially different 
credit decisions based on an evaluation of dif-
ferent credit reports obtained from different 
CRAs. 
(C) A February 2015 Consumer Bureau report 
titled ‘‘Consumer Voices on Credit Reports and 
Scores’’ found that consumers had questions 
about what actions to take to improve their 
scores once they had seen them, suggesting that 
additional disclosures and educational content 
would be helpful to consumers. The Consumer 
Bureau found that consumers were confused by 
conflicting advice on how to improve their 
scores. 
(D) That report also noted that consumers 
found the process for obtaining consumer re-
ports and credit scores confusing. Consumers 
also were uncertain about whether, and under 
what circumstances, they could obtain a con-
sumer report for free. 
(5) PRIVATE EDUCATION LOANS.— 
(A) The Consumer Bureau’s October 2014 re-
port titled ‘‘Annual Report of the CFPB Student 
Loan Ombudsman’’ noted many private edu-
cation loan borrowers, who sought to negotiate 
a modified repayment plan when they were ex-
periencing a period of financial distress, were 
unable to get assistance from their loan holders, 
which often resulting in them defaulting on 
their loans. This pattern resembles the difficulty 
that a significant number of mortgage loan bor-
rowers experienced when they sought to take re-
sponsible steps to work with their mortgage loan 
servicer to avoid foreclosure during the Great 
Recession. 
(B) Although private student loan holders 
may allow a borrower to postpone payments 
while enrolled in school full-time, many limit 
this option to a certain time period, usually 48 
to 66 months. This limited time period may not 
be sufficient for those who need additional time 
to obtain their degree or who want to continue 
their education by pursing a graduate or profes-
sional degree. The Consumer Bureau found that 
borrowers who were unable to make payments 
often defaulted or had their accounts sent to 
collections before they were even able to grad-
uate. 
(6) DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AT CERTAIN PROPRI-
ETARY
EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS
AND
CAREER 
EDUCATION PROGRAMS.— 
(A) NCLC cited the proliferation of law en-
forcement 
actions 
against 
many 
for-profit 
schools in its June 2014 report, titled ‘‘Ensuring 
Educational Integrity: 10 Steps to Improve State 
Oversight of For-profit Schools’’, to demonstrate 
the pervasive problem in this sector of targeting 
low-income students with deceptive high-pres-
sure sales techniques involving inflated job 
placement rates and misleading data on grad-
uate wages, and false representations about the 
transferability of credits and the employability 
of graduates in occupations that require licen-
sure. Student loan borrowers at these schools 
may be left with nothing but worthless creden-
tials and large debt. Those who default on their 
student loans face years with damaged credit 
that will adversely impact their ability to rent or 
buy homes, purchase cars, and find employ-
ment.

(B) The closure and bankruptcy of Corinthian 
Colleges, which was found to have deceived stu-
dents by steering them into high-interest student 
loans based on misleading graduation rates and 
employment data, is a good example of the prob-
lem. Even after its closure, many Corinthian 
students remained saddled with student loan 
debt, worthless degrees, and few prospects for 
employment. 
(C) Attending a two-year, for-profit college 
costs, on average, four times as much as attend-
ing a community college. Students at for-profit 
colleges represent only about 11 percent of the 
total higher education population but a star-
tling 44 percent of all Federal student loan de-
faults, according to the United States Depart-
ment of Education (‘‘DOE’’). 
(D) According to NCLC, a disproportionate 
number of for-profit students are low-income 
and people of color. These schools target vet-
erans, working parents, first-generation stu-
dents, and non-English speaking students, who 
may be more likely than their public or private 
nonprofit school counterparts to drop out, incur 
enormous student debt, and default on this debt. 
In the 2011–2012 school year, 28 percent of Afri-
can Americans and 15 percent of Latinos at-
tending four-year institutions were enrolled in a 
for-profit school, compared to 10 percent of 
Whites. 
(E) As highlighted in a press release titled 
‘‘Obama Administration Announces Final Rules 
to Protect Students from Poor-Performing Ca-
reer College Programs’’, that was issued by the 
DOE on October 30, 2014, ‘‘ƒt≈oo often, students 
at career colleges—including thousands of vet-
erans—are charged excessive costs, but don’t get 
the education they paid for. Instead, students in 
such programs are provided with poor quality 
training, often for low-wage jobs or in occupa-
tions where there are simply no job opportuni-
ties. They find themselves with large amounts of 
debt and, too often, end up in default. In many 
cases, students are drawn into these programs 
with confusing or misleading information.’’. 
(7) MEDICAL DEBT.— 
(A) Research by the Consumer Bureau has 
found that the inclusion of medical collections 
on consumer reports has unfairly reduced con-
sumers’ credit scores. 
(B) The Consumer Bureau’s review of 5 mil-
lion anonymized credit files from September 2011 
to September 2013, for example, found that cred-
it scores may underestimate a person’s credit-
worthiness by up to 10 points for those who owe 
medical debt, and may underestimate a person’s 
creditworthiness by up to 22 points after the 
medical debt has been paid. For consumers with 
lower credit scores, especially those on the brink 
of what is considered subprime, a 10 to 22 point 
decrease in their credit scores can have a signifi-
cant impact on their lives, including by affect-
ing whether they are able to qualify for credit 
and, if so, the terms and conditions under which 
it is extended to them. 
(C) The Consumer Bureau found that half of 
all collections trade lines that appear on con-
sumer reports are related to medical bills 
claimed to be owed to hospitals and other med-
ical providers. These trade lines affect the re-
ports of nearly 1/5 of all consumers in the credit 
reporting system. 
(D) The Consumer Bureau has found that 
there are no objective or enforceable standards 
that determine when a debt can or should be re-
ported as a collection trade line. Because debt 
buyers and collectors determine whether, when, 
and for how long to report a collection account, 
there is only a limited relationship between the 
time period reported, the severity of a delin-
quency, and when or whether a collection trade 
line appears on a consumer’s credit report. 
(E) Medical bills can be complex and con-
fusing for many consumers, which results in 
consumers’ uncertainty about what they owe, to 
whom, when, or for what, that may cause some 
people, who ordinarily pay their bills on time, to 
delay or withhold payments on their medical 
debts. This uncertainty can also result in med-
ical collections appearing on consumer reports. 
In a December 2014 report titled ‘‘Consumer 
Credit Reports: A Study of Medical and Non- 
Medical Collections’’, the Consumer Bureau 
found that a large portion of consumers with 
medical collections show no other evidence of fi-
nancial distress and are consumers who ordi-
narily pay their other financial obligations on 
time. Unlike with most credit products or serv-
ices, such as credit cards, installment loans, 
utilities, or wireless or cable services that have 
contractual account disclosures describing the 
terms and conditions of use, most consumers are 
not told what their out-of-pocket medical costs 
will be in advance. Consumers needing urgent or 
emergency care rarely know, or are provided, 
the cost of a medical treatment or procedure be-
fore the service is rendered. 
(F) The Consumer Bureau concluded that the 
presence of medical collections is less predictive 
of future defaults or serious delinquencies than 
the presence of a nonmedical collection in a 
study titled ‘‘Data Point: Medical Debt and 
Credit Scores’’, issued in May 2014. 
(G) FICO’s latest credit scoring model, ‘‘FICO 
9’’, changes the treatment of paid collections to 
disregard any collection matters that the con-
sumer has paid in full. FICO 9, however, is not 
yet widely used by lenders. 
(H) VantageScore’s latest credit scoring model, 
‘‘VantageScore 4.0’’, will be available in the fall 
of 2017. This model will penalize medical collec-
tions less than non-medical ones. 
(I) The three nationwide CRAs entered into a 
settlement agreement with the New York State 
attorney general in 2015 to address deficiencies 
in their dispute resolution process and enhance 
the accuracy of items on reports. These policy 
changes will be implemented in a three-phrased 
rollout, culminating by June 2018. Subsequently, 
these CRAs entered into a cooperative agree-
ment with 31 State Attorneys General, which 
was the basis of the creation of the National 
Consumer Assistance Plan (‘‘NCAP’’) to change 
some of their business practices. 
(J) While the CRAs appear to be voluntarily 
adopting policy changes on a nationwide basis, 
they are not obligated to do so for consumers 
who reside in States that are not party to any 
of the consent orders. 
(K) As a result of the settlement agreements, 
the three nationwide CRAs will set a 180-day 
waiting period before including medical collec-
tions on a report and will remove a medical col-
lection from a report once it is paid by an insur-
ance company. While this change will benefit 
many, once a medical collection appears on a re-
port, it will only be deleted or suppressed if it is 
found to have been the insurance company’s ob-
ligation to pay and the insurer pays it. Given 
the research showing there is little predictive 
value in medical debt information, medical col-
lections that are paid or settled should quickly 
be removed from a report, regardless of who 
pays or settles this debt. 
(8) FINANCIAL ABUSE BY KNOWN PERSONS.— 
(A) Financial abuse and exploitation are fre-
quently associated with domestic violence. This 
type of abuse may result in fraudulent charges 
to a credit card or having fraudulent accounts 
created by the abuser in the survivor’s name 
that could affect ratings by CRAs. Financial 
abuse may also result in the survivor’s inability 
to make timely payments on their valid obliga-
tions due to loss or changes in income that can 
occur when their abuser steals from or coerces 
the survivor to relinquish their paychecks or 
savings that could affect ratings by CRAs. 
(B) By racking up substantial debts in the 
survivor’s name, abusers are able to exercise fi-
nancial control over their survivors to make it 
economically difficult for the survivor, whose 
credit is often destroyed, to escape the situation. 
(C) Domestic abuse survivors with poor credit 
are likely to face significant obstacles in estab-
lishing financial independence from their abus-
ers. This can be due, in part, because consumer 
reports may be used when a person attempts to 
obtain a checking account, housing, insurance, 
utilities, employment, and even a security clear-
ance as required for certain jobs. 
(D) Providing documentation of identity 
(‘‘ID’’) theft in order to dispute information on 
one’s consumer report can be particularly chal-
lenging for those who know their financial 
abuser. 
(E) While it is easier for consumers who ob-
tain a police report to remove fraudulent infor-
mation from their consumer report and prevent 
it from reappearing in the future, according to 
the Empire Justice Center, safety and other non-
credit concerns may impact the capacity of a 
survivor of financial abuse committed by a 
known person to turn to law enforcement to get 
a police report. 
(F) According to the Legal Aid Society in New 
York, domestic abuse survivors, seeking to re-
move adverse information stemming from finan-
cial abuse by contacting their furnishers di-
rectly, are likely to face skepticism about claims 
of ID theft perpetrated by a partner because of 
an assumption that they are aware of, and may 
have been complicit in, the activity which the 
survivor alleges stems from financial abuse. 
(9) DECEPTIVE
AND
MISLEADING
MARKETING 
PRACTICES.— 
(A) The Consumer Bureau’s February 2015 re-
port titled ‘‘Consumer Voices on Credit Reports 
and Scores’’ found that some consumers did not 
obtain a copy of their consumer report due to 
concerns about security or of being trapped into 
purchasing unwanted products like an addi-
tional report or a credit monitoring service. 
(B) In January 2017, the Consumer Bureau 
fined TransUnion and Equifax for deceptively 
marketing credit scores for purchase by con-
sumers as the same credit scores typically used 
by lenders to determine creditworthiness and for 
luring consumers into costly subscription serv-
ices that were advertised as ‘‘free’’ or ‘‘$1’’ that 
automatically charged recurring fees unless 
cancelled by consumers. The Consumer Bureau 
also found that Equifax was illegally adver-
tising its products on webpages that consumers 
accessed through AnnualCreditReport.com be-
fore consumers obtained their free disclosures. 
Because 
of 
these 
troubling 
practices, 
TransUnion was ordered to pay $13.9 million in 
restitution to harmed consumers and a civil pen-
alty of $3 million to the Consumer Bureau. 
Equifax was ordered to pay more than $3.7 mil-
lion to affected consumers as well as a civil 
money penalty of $2.5 million to the Consumer 
Bureau. As part of the consent orders, the CRAs 
are also supposed to change the way that they 
sell their products to consumers. The CRAs must 
also obtain consumers’ express consent before 
enrolling them into subscription services as well 
as make it easer for consumers to cancel these 
programs. 
(C) The Consumer Bureau fined the other na-
tionwide CRA—Experian—in March 2017 for de-
ceiving consumers about the use of credit scores 
that it marketed and sold to consumers as credit 
scores that were used by lenders and for ille-
gally advertising its products on web pages that 
consumers 
accessed 
through 
AnnualCreditReport.com before they obtained 
their free annual disclosures. Experian was or-
dered to pay more than $3.7 million in restitu-
tion to harmed consumers and a civil monetary 
penalty of $2.5 million to the Consumer Bureau. 
(D) The Consumer Bureau’s January and 
March 2017 consent orders with the three na-
tionwide CRAs show that these CRAs have en-
ticed consumers into purchasing products and 
services that they may not want or need, in 
some instances by advertising products or serv-
ices ‘‘free’’ that automatically converted into an 
ongoing subscription service at the regular price 
unless cancelled by the consumer. Although 
these CRAs must now change their deceptive 
marketing practices, codifying these duties is an 
appropriate way to ensure that these companies 
never revert back to such misleading tactics.

(E) Given the ubiquitous use of consumer re-
ports in consumers’ lives and the fact that con-
sumers’ participation in the credit reporting sys-
tem is involuntary, CRAs should also prioritize 
providing consumers with the effective means to 
safeguard their personal and financial informa-
tion and improve their credit standing, rather 
than seeking to exploit consumers’ concerns and 
confusion about credit reporting and scoring, to 
boost their companies’ profits. 
(F) Vulnerable consumers, who have legiti-
mate concerns about the security of their per-
sonal and financial information, deserve clear, 
accurate, and transparent information about 
the credit reporting tools that may be available 
to them, such as fraud alerts and freezes. 
(10) CLARITY IN CREDIT SCORING.— 
(A) The February 2015 report of the Bureau of 
Consumer Financial Protection titled ‘‘Con-
sumer Voices on Credit Reports and Scores’’ 
found that some consumers are reluctant to 
comparison shop for loans and other types of 
consumer credit products out of fear that they 
will lower their credit scores by doing so. 
(B) The Consumer Bureau found that one of 
the most common barriers for people in review-
ing their own credit reports and shopping for 
the best credit terms was a lack of under-
standing of the differences between ‘‘soft’’ and 
‘‘hard’’ inquiries and whether requesting a copy 
of their own report would adversely impact their 
credit standing. 
(C) The Bureau of Consumer Financial Pro-
tection revealed that consumers with accurate 
perceptions of their creditworthiness may be bet-
ter equipped to shop for favorable credit terms. 
(11) CREDIT CHECKS AND EMPLOYMENT DECI-
SIONS.— 
(A) The use of consumer reports as a factor in 
making hiring decisions has been found to be 
prevalent in a diverse array of occupations, and 
is not limited to certain high-level management 
or executive positions. 
(B) According to the California Labor Federa-
tion, only 25 percent of employers researched 
the credit history of job applicants in 1998. How-
ever, this practice had increased to 43 percent by 
2006 and to 60 percent by 2011. 
(C) A study titled ‘‘Do Job Applicant Credit 
Histories Predict Job Performance Appraisal 
Ratings or Termination Decisions?’’, published 
in 2012, found that, while credit history might 
conceptually measure a person’s level of respon-
sibility, ability to meet deadlines, dependability, 
or integrity, it does not, in practice, actually 
predict an employee’s performance or likelihood 
to quit. Credit reports contain many inaccura-
cies and credit history can be contaminated by 
events that are sometimes outside a person’s 
control, such as a sudden medical expense after 
an accident or the loss of a job during an eco-
nomic downturn. The study found that there is 
no benefit from using credit history to predict 
job performance or turnover. 
(D) Despite the absence of data showing a 
correlation between job performance and credit- 
worthiness, employers continue to use credit 
checks as a proxy for assessing character and 
integrity. According to a 2012 Society for Human 
Resource Management survey, organizations in-
dicated that they used credit checks on job can-
didates primarily to reduce or prevent theft and 
embezzlement and to minimize legal liability for 
negligent hiring. 
(E) The use of credit checks for employment 
purposes creates a true ‘‘catch-22’’ for unem-
ployed people with impaired credit. For exam-
ple, the financial hardship caused by losing a 
job may cause some unemployed individuals to 
make late or partial payments on their bills, but 
their poor credit standing caused by this nega-
tive information on their consumer report can 
also impede their chances of obtaining a new job 
to end their financial distress. 
(F) A September 2014 report by the New York 
City Council’s Committee on Civil Rights noted 
that, for those who have been unemployed for 
an extended period of time and whose credit has 
suffered as they fell behind on bills, the use of 
credit reports in the hiring process can exacer-
bate and perpetuate an already precarious situ-
ation. 
(G) In a March 2013 Demos report titled ‘‘Dis-
credited: How Employment Credit Checks Keep 
Out Qualified Workers Out of a Job’’, one in 
four survey participants who were unemployed 
said that a potential employer had requested to 
check their credit report as part of a job appli-
cation. Among job applicants with blemished 
credit histories in the survey, one in seven had 
been told that they were not being hired because 
of their credit history. 
(H) While job applicants must give prior ap-
proval for a prospective employer to pull their 
credit reports under the FCRA, this authoriza-
tion, as a practical matter, does not constitute 
an effective consumer protection because an em-
ployer may reject any job applicant who refuses 
a credit check. 
(I) Some negative information on a report may 
stem from uncontrollable circumstances, or sig-
nificant life events in a consumer’s life, such as 
a medical crisis or a divorce. Demos found that 
poor credit is associated with household unem-
ployment, lack of health coverage, and medical 
debt, which are factors that reflect economic 
conditions in the country and personal misfor-
tune that have little relationship with how well 
a job applicant would perform at work. 
(J) In October 2011, FICO noted that from 2008 
to 2009 approximately 50 million people experi-
enced a 20-point drop in their credit scores and 
about 21 million saw their scores decline by more 
than 50 points. While the Great Recession re-
duced many consumers’ credit scores due to 
foreclosures and other financial hardships, the 
financial crisis had a particularly harsh impact 
on African Americans and Latinos, as racial 
and ethnic minorities and communities of color 
were frequently targeted by predatory mortgage 
lenders who steered borrowers into high-cost 
subprime loans, even when these borrowers 
would have qualified for less costly prime credit. 
(K) A May 2006 Brookings Institution report 
titled ‘‘Credit Scores, Reports, and Getting 
Ahead in America’’ found that counties with a 
relatively higher proportion of racial and ethnic 
minorities in the United States tended to have 
lower credit scores compared with counties that 
had a lower concentration of communities of 
color. 
(L) Studies have consistently found that Afri-
can American and Latino households tend, on 
average, to have lower credit scores than White 
households. The growing use of credit checks, 
therefore, may disproportionately screen other-
wise qualified racial and ethnic minorities out of 
jobs, leading to discriminatory hiring practices, 
and further exacerbating the trend where unem-
ployment for African American and Latino com-
munities is elevated well above the rate of 
Whites. 
(M) A 2012 Demos survey found that 65 per-
cent of White respondents reported having good 
or excellent credit scores while over half of Afri-
can American households reported only having 
fair or bad credit.

port titled ‘‘Consumer Voices on Credit Reports 
and Scores’’ found that some consumers did not

mate concerns about the security of their per-
sonal and financial information, deserve clear, 
accurate, and transparent information about 
the credit reporting tools that may be available 
to them, such as fraud alerts and freezes. 
(13) PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS’ CREDIT IN-
FORMATION.— 
(A) Despite heightened awareness, incidents 
of ID theft continue to rise. In February 2015, 
the Federal Government reported that ID theft 
was the top consumer complaint that it received 
for the 15th consecutive year. As these incidents 
increase, consumers experience significant fi-
nancial loss and emotional distress from the in-
ability to safeguard effectively and inexpen-
sively their credit information from bad actors. 
(B) According to a Carnegie Mellon study, 
children are 50 times more likely than adults to 
have their identities stolen. Child identities are 
valuable to thieves because most children do not 
have existing files, and their parents may not 
notice fraudulent activity until their child ap-
plies for a student loan, a job, or a credit card. 
As a result, the fraudulent activity of the bad 
actors may go undetected for years. 
(C) Despite the increasing incidents of chil-
dren’s ID theft, parents who want to proactively 
prevent their children from having their identity 
stolen, may not be able to do so. Only one of the 
three nationwide CRAs currently allows parents 
from any State to set up a freeze for a minor 
child. At the other two nationwide CRAs, par-
ents can only obtain a freeze after a child has 
become an ID theft victim because, it is only at 
this point, that these CRAs have an existing

credit file for the child. While many States have 
enacted laws to address this problem, there is no 
existing Federal law. 
(D) 
According 
to 
Javelin 
Strategy 
& 
Research’s 2015 Identity Fraud study, $16 billion 
was stolen by fraudsters from 12.7 million Amer-
ican consumers in 2014. Similarly, the United 
States Department of Justice found an estimated 
7 percent of all residents age 16 or older (about 
17.6 million persons) in this country were victims 
of one or more incidents of ID theft in 2014, and 
the number of elderly victims age 65 or older 
(about 86 percent) increased from 2.1 million in 
2012 to 2.6 million in 2014. 
(E) Consumers frequently express concern 
about the security of their financial informa-
tion. According to a 2015 MasterCard survey, a 
majority of consumers (77 percent) have anxiety 
about the possibility that their financial infor-
mation and Social Security numbers may be sto-
len or compromised, with about 55 percent of 
consumers indicating that they would rather 
have naked pictures of themselves leaked online 
than have their financial information stolen. 
(F) That survey also revealed that consumers’ 
fears about the online security of their financial 
information even outweighed consumers’ worries 
about other physical security dangers such as 
having their houses robbed (59 percent) or being 
pickpocketed (46 percent). 
(G) According to Consumer Reports, roughly 
50 million American consumers spent about $3.5 
billion in 2010 to purchase products aimed at 
protecting their identity, with the annual cost 
of these services ranging from $120 to $300. As 
risks to consumers’ personal and financial infor-
mation continue to grow, consumers need addi-
tional protections to ensure that they have fair 
and reasonable access to the full suite of ID 
theft and fraud prevention measures that may 
be right for them.

TITLE I—IMPROVEMENTS TO THE 
DISPUTE PROCESS 
SEC. 101. DISPUTE PROCEDURES AND DISCLO-
SURES RELATING TO REINVESTIGA-
TIONS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 611(a) of the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681i(a)) is 
amended to read as follows: 
‘‘(a) REINVESTIGATIONS OF DISPUTED INFOR-
MATION BY A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY.— 
‘‘(1) REINVESTIGATIONS REQUIRED.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subsection (f), if 
the completeness or accuracy of any item of in-
formation contained in a consumer’s file at a 
consumer reporting agency is disputed by the 
consumer and the consumer notifies the agency 
(either directly or indirectly through a reseller 
or an authorized third party) of such dispute, 
the agency shall, free of charge— 
‘‘(i) conduct a reasonable reinvestigation 
using the process described in paragraph (3) to 
determine whether the disputed information is 
inaccurate, incomplete, or cannot be verified; 
‘‘(ii) notify the consumer that a notation de-
scribed in section 605(e) will be added to the 
consumer’s file until the reinvestigation has 
been completed and that such notation can be 
removed at the request of the consumer; and 
‘‘(iii) before the end of the 30-day period be-
ginning on the date on which the consumer re-
porting agency receives the notice of the dispute 
from the consumer or the reseller— 
‘‘(I) record the current status of the disputed 
information; or 
‘‘(II) delete or modify the item in accordance 
with paragraph (3)(D). 
‘‘(B) EXTENSION
OF
PERIOD
TO
REINVES-
TIGATE.—Except as provided in subparagraph 
(C), the 30-day period described in subpara-
graph (A) may be extended for period not to ex-
ceed 15 days if the consumer reporting agency 
receives additional information from the con-
sumer or the reseller regarding the dispute after 
the date on which the consumer reporting agen-
cy notified any person who provided any item of 
information in dispute under paragraph (2)(A). 
‘‘(C) LIMITATIONS ON EXTENSION OF PERIOD TO 
REINVESTIGATE.—Subparagraph (B) shall not 
apply to any reinvestigation in which, during 
the 30-day period described in subparagraph 
(A), the disputed information is found to be in-
accurate or incomplete, or the consumer report-
ing agency determines that the disputed infor-
mation cannot be verified. 
‘‘(2) PROMPT NOTICE OF DISPUTE TO FURNISHER 
OF
INFORMATION; PROVISION
OF
INFORMATION 
REGARDING DISPUTE PROVIDED BY THE CONSUMER 
OR RESELLER.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Before the end of the pe-
riod of 5 business days beginning on the date on 
which a consumer reporting agency receives no-
tice of a dispute from any consumer or reseller 
under paragraph (1)(A), the consumer reporting 
agency shall provide notification of the dispute 
to any person who provided any item of infor-
mation in dispute, at the address and in the 
manner established with such person. The no-
tice shall include all information, including sub-
stantiating documents, regarding the dispute 
that was submitted to the consumer reporting 
agency. 
‘‘(B) PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
REGARDING DISPUTE AFTER NOTIFICATION TO THE 
FURNISHER OF INFORMATION.—If a consumer re-
porting agency receives additional information 
regarding the dispute from the consumer or re-
seller after the agency provides the notification 
described under subparagraph (A) and before 
the end of the 30-day period described in para-
graph (1)(A), the consumer reporting agency 
shall, not later than 3 business days after re-
ceiving such information, provide such informa-
tion to the person who provided the information 
in dispute. 
‘‘(3) REASONABLE STANDARDS FOR CONSUMER 
REPORTING AGENCIES FOR CONDUCTING REINVES-
TIGATIONS AND RESOLVING DISPUTES SUBMITTED 
BY CONSUMERS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—In conducting a reinves-
tigation of disputed information, a consumer re-
porting agency shall, at a minimum— 
‘‘(i) maintain sufficient resources and trained 
staff, commensurate with the volume and com-
plexity of disputes received or reasonably antici-
pated to be received, to determine whether the 
disputed information is accurate, complete, or 
can be verified by the person who provided the 
information; 
‘‘(ii) ensure that all staff involved at any level 
of the reinvestigation process, including any in-
dividual with ultimate authority over deter-
mining whether the disputed information is in-
accurate, incomplete, or cannot be verified, are 
located within the United States; 
‘‘(iii) verify that the personally identifiable 
information of the consumer submitting the dis-
pute matches the personally identifiable infor-
mation contained in the consumer’s file, and 
that such information is accurate and complete; 
‘‘(iv) verify that the consumer reporting agen-
cy has a record of the information being dis-
puted; and 
‘‘(v) conduct a reasonable review that con-
siders all information, including substantiating 
documents, provided by the consumer or reseller. 
‘‘(B) CONSUMER
REPORTING.—The consumer

party is not authorized to submit the dispute on 
the consumer’s behalf. If the consumer reporting

‘‘(3) KEY
FACTORS.—The term ‘key factors’

SEC. 203. DISCLOSURES RELATING TO CREDIT 
SCORES AND EDUCATIONAL CREDIT 
SCORES. 
Section 609(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
(15 U.S.C. 1681g(f)), as amended by section 202, 
is further amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing new paragraphs: 
‘‘(5) WEBSITE
DISCLAIMER.—A consumer re-
porting agency that generates or provides credit 
scores or educational credit scores shall clearly 
and conspicuously display on the home page of 
the agency’s Internet website, and as part of 
any application, solicitation, or marketing mate-
rial or media providing information related to a 
credit score or educational credit score, the fol-
lowing notice, in boldface type of 18-point font 
or larger and in a text box with boldface outer 
borders: 
‘‘ ‘CREDIT SCORE DISCLAIMER. ‘‘ ‘ 
There is no ‘‘one’’ credit score. There are 
many scoring formulas derived from a wide vari-
ety of models available to a consumer and used 
by lenders and creditors. Different lenders and 
creditors use different scoring formulas to deter-
mine whether to extend credit or make a loan to 
you, and the terms of the credit or loan. An edu-
cational credit score is not a credit score that a 
person who makes a loan or extends credit to 
you is likely to use. Educational credit scores 
are merely intended to be used as an edu-
cational tool to help consumers understand how 
the information contained in a consumer report 
may affect the terms and conditions of a loan or 
extension of credit that may be available to a 
consumer. Lenders and creditors may also rely 
on information not contained in your consumer 
report and not reflected in the calculation of 
your credit score.’. 
‘‘(6) ADDITIONAL
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
EDU-
CATIONAL CREDIT SCORES.— 
‘‘(A) DISCLAIMER.—If an educational credit 
score is provided pursuant to paragraph (1), a 
consumer reporting agency shall clearly and 
conspicuously include in a prominent location 
on the statement, in boldface type of 18-point 
font or larger, and in a text box with boldface 
outer borders, the following notice: 
‘‘ ‘EDUCATIONAL CREDIT SCORE DISCLAIMER. ‘‘ ‘ 
The educational credit score provided to you 
is not a credit score that a lender or creditor is 
likely to use to make a loan or extend credit to 
you. There are many different credit scores de-
rived from a wide variety of models used by 
lenders and creditors. An educational credit 
score is merely an educational tool. It is in-
tended to provide consumers with a basic under-
standing of how the information contained in a 
consumer report may affect the terms and condi-
tions of credit that are available. The credit 
scores you receive directly from different lenders 
and creditors may not be the same as an edu-
cational credit score. There are a number of rea-
sons for this: 
‘‘ ‘(1) Each company may use a different for-
mula for calculating credit scores and the dif-
ferences in the formulas may lead to differences 
in your scores. 
‘‘ ‘(2) Companies may produce scores that give 
results on different scales. 
‘‘ ‘(3) Not all lenders or creditors report to 
every consumer reporting agency, and therefore 
the information contained in your consumer re-
port that the consumer reporting agencies use to 
calculate your educational credit score may dif-
fer among agencies.’. 
‘‘(B) PROHIBITION ON MISLEADING REPRESEN-
TATIONS.—A consumer reporting agency may not 
refer to an educational credit score as a credit 
score in any application, solicitation, mar-
keting, or other informational materials or 
media. 
‘‘(7) MODIFICATION OF DISCLAIMERS.—The Bu-
reau may modify the content, format, and man-
ner of the disclaimers required under para-
graphs (5) and (6), if warranted, after con-
ducting consumer testing or research.’’. 
SEC. 204. FREE CREDIT SCORE DISCLOSURES AND

inserting a semicolon; 
(C) in paragraph (3), by striking the period at

consumer has already received a credit report, 
credit score, or educational credit score under 
such section.’’; 
(4) in subsection (d), by inserting ‘‘(including 
the disclosure of a credit score or educational 
credit score under subsection (f) of such sec-
tion)’’ after ‘‘section 609’’; 
(5) in subsection (f)(1)— 
(A) by striking ‘‘reasonable charge’’ and all 
that follows through ‘‘section 609’’ and inserting 
‘‘reasonable charge on a consumer for providing 
a consumer report to a consumer’’; 
(B) by striking subparagraph (B); 
(C) by redesignating clauses (i) and (ii) as 
subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively (and

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. DESAULNIER 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–383. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
In title IX, add at the end the following: 
SEC. 904. GAO STUDY ON THE USE OF CREDIT IN 
HOUSING DETERMINATIONS. 
(a) STUDY.—The Comptroller General of 
the United States shall carry out a study of 
the use of consumer reports and credit scores 
in housing determinations to determine 
whether consumer reports or credit scores 
are being used as tools to perform the equiv-
alent of banned red-lining. 
(b) CONTENTS OF STUDY.—In carrying out 
the study required under subsection (a), the 
Comptroller General shall— 
(1) examine both rental applications and 
mortgage applications; and 
(2) include a demographic breakdown by 
race, gender, age, sexual orientation, city/ 
suburban/rural, socioeconomic status, and 
any other demographic that the Comptroller 
General determines appropriate. 
(c) 
REPORT.—The 
Comptroller 
General 
shall issue a report to the Congress con-
taining all findings and determinations made 
in carrying out the study required under sub-
section (a). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. DESAULNIER) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Chairman, I first state my admi-
ration for the chair of the committee 
and Ms. PRESSLEY and everyone who 
has worked on this piece of legislation. 
Mr. Chairman, credit scores and cred-
it reports impact our daily lives, often 
in ways that we don’t realize. They de-
termine whether you can get a loan for 
a car that you need to get to work 
every day. They determine whether 
you can get a loan to buy a home or 
rent an apartment and how much in-
terest you are going to pay on your 
home loan. They impact your insur-
ance premium and your cell phone. In 
many States, these scores can even de-
termine whether you get a job or not. 
Unfortunately, even though they can 
have an enormous consequence on a 
person’s life, these reports have very 
little oversight and can easily be inac-
curate. Even when inaccuracies are 
spotted by consumers, the process for 
removing or correcting the mistakes is 
perhaps intentionally complicated and 
time consuming for the average Amer-
ican. A person with multiple jobs or no 
knowledge of credit reporting systems 
could very well give up—and often 
does—because the system is too com-
plex for them. 
This is not only a frustrating cycle 
but is also damaging to a person’s fi-
nancial reputation. We need to know 
more about how mistakes are made, 
who is responsible for fixing them, and 
what the impacts of those mistakes are 
on individual Americans’ lives. 
For too long, financial stability has 
been used as an excuse to keep lower 
income people out of traditionally 
wealthy and middle-class neighbor-
hoods. This process, known as ‘‘red-
lining,’’ has been banned, but we con-
tinue to see the segregation of our 
neighborhoods along demographic and 
economic lines. Credit scores are being 
weaponized to exclude and separate 
communities. 
To address this problem, we need re-
liable data. That is why this amend-
ment would require the nonpartisan 
GAO to study how credit scores are 
used in housing decisions and examine 
whether individuals are being discrimi-
nated against in those decisions based 
on race, gender, age, sexual orienta-
tion, 
geographic 
location, 
socio-
economic status, and more. 
Our society cannot continue to be 
broken into neighborhoods and commu-
nities based on the color of our skin or 
the amount of money in our bank ac-
counts. This amendment will help us 
right this wrong and encourage hous-
ing decisions that are more equitable 
and fair for all Americans. 
Mr. Chairman, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in support of this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I 
claim the time in opposition, although 
I am not opposed to this amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, let me 
first say I oppose any disparate treat-
ment of any person or population. That 
has no place in our society or our com-
munities. 
To that end, the data derived from 
this study would have been helpful to 
have had before we drafted a bill or we 
brought it to the House floor. I think it 
is important data for us to consider 
here as we make law. 
The underlying bill removes impor-
tant predictive information from con-
sumer credit reports that helps lenders 
in assessing a borrower’s ability to 
repay. Undermining this responsibility 
makes it riskier and more expensive 
for lenders to extend credit, which, ul-
timately, increases the cost for con-
sumers. Now, that is problematic; but 
that is the bill, and the bill is problem-
atic. 
Buying a home is the biggest pur-
chase that most Americans will make 
in their lifetime. And while the study 
is fine and will give us more data, it 
does nothing to make mortgages more 
affordable or available for those con-
sumers who desire homeownership. The 
fact is the underlying bill will make 
mortgages even more expensive for 
consumers and consumer credit more 
expensive for those who seek it. 
As I said, I am not opposed to this 
amendment, but more data is obviously 
always useful. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I agree, and as a former small busi-
ness owner, I see the value of credit re-
ports if done fairly and equitably. It 
should be balanced against the need for 
the lenders and the people who are 
seeking credit. 
In my area in northern California, I 
hear stories over and over again about 
people who are working two jobs, and, 
through no mistake of their own, their 
credit report is not perfect. They don’t 
have the time or the expertise to hire 
someone or to go back in and correct 
the problems. Often, problems can be 
left on even when they go through the 
process. 
As somebody who was in the retail 
business, I see this as another example 
of customer service being put on the 
customer. 
Twenty, 30 years ago, to the credit 
agencies and retailers—at least, in the-
ory—customer 
service 
meant 
you 
reached out to the client and tried to 
figure out what the problem is. My ex-
perience and the experience I get 
anecdotally and the research that I see 
is that, particularly in difficult hous-
ing markets, the ability for people to 
get into the housing market either for

rental or for purchase is inhibited and 
is an obstacle to current reporting. 
So, for this amendment, it is about 
getting more knowledge in a dynamic 
that only 10 years ago was almost dis-
astrous to the economy when the hous-
ing implosion happened and is hap-
pening in many ways again as we, as 
researchers say, in urban areas reseg-
regate based on ethnicity and demo-
graphics. 
So, in order to get a better under-
standing, I think this amendment is a 
minimal standard of understanding 
how the situation has changed and how 
we can protect both the people who are 
the lenders and also the people who 
may not be lenders but are just trying 
to get to a point where they can rent 
an apartment or own a home. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
back the balance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MS. SHALALA

part B of House Report 116–383. 
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chairman, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
In title IX, add at the end the following: 
SEC. 904. GAO STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF CRED-
IT SCORES IMPACTED BY A STUDENT 
BORROWER’S DEFAULTED OR DE-
LINQUENT 
PRIVATE 
EDUCATION 
LOAN. 
(a) STUDY.—The Comptroller General of 
the United States shall carry out a study on 
how credit scores impacted by a student bor-
rower’s defaulted or delinquent private edu-
cation loan impacts applying for future 
loans, including information on the treat-
ment of different demographic populations. 
(b) 
REPORT.—The 
Comptroller 
General 
shall issue a report to the Congress con-
taining all findings and determinations made 
in carrying out the study required under sub-
section (a). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. SHALALA) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, when you default on a 
student loan, you impact your credit 
score. Indeed, your credit score with all 
three credit agencies will most likely 
drop. That means that buying or rent-
ing a house, purchasing or leasing a ve-
hicle, going back to school, or receiv-
ing competitive offers for credit cards 
will be very difficult. 
Each year, more than 1 million stu-
dent loan borrowers go into default. 
Nearly 40 percent of borrowers today 
are expected to default on their stu-
dent loans by 2023. 
We know that people most at risk of 
defaulting on their student loans are 
more likely to be Hispanic or African 
American. Defaulters are more likely 
to be older, to be Pell grant recipients, 
and to come from a nontraditional edu-
cational background when compared to 
borrowers who never default. 
Research also tells us that people of 
color are more burdened by their edu-
cational debt. They have less parental 
wealth to draw on, as well as higher 
rates of unemployment. 
By the time their loan falls into de-
fault, a typical borrower will see their 
score drop around 60 points, to an aver-
age of 550, which is considered very 
poor. 
Entering default makes it harder to 
obtain future loans and prevents bor-
rowers from receiving any additional 
Federal student aid until their loans 
return to good standing. Loan pro-
viders can then begin to garnish their 
wages, to impose restrictions on earn-
ings, and to take their tax refund. 
A student loan default stays on your 
credit report for 7 years—even if you 
pay off the loan in full. Having that no-
tification on your credit report will 
make lenders nervous about working 
with you and hurt your economic sta-
bility for years. 
Mr. Chairman, my amendment in-
structs the GAO to carry out a thor-
ough review on how credit scores im-
pacted by a student loan default can 
destroy people’s lives. The amendment 
also asks the GAO to examine how 
multiple delinquencies on private stu-
dent loans can hurt borrowers, includ-
ing a demographic breakdown by race, 
gender, age, sexual orientation, and so-
cioeconomic status. 
Allowing student loans to enter de-
linquency can often have a negative ef-
fect on a borrower’s credit score and in 
credit reports due to the fact that each 
loan is reported individually. 
Mr. Chairman, Congress has a vested 
interest in ensuring that we expand the 
middle class, we grow the economy, 
and we protect consumers from irre-
versible financial damage to their cred-
it. I believe that H.R. 3621, with the in-
clusion of this amendment, will estab-
lish parity for student borrowers and 
provide Congress with the necessary 
tools to craft meaningful legislation 
that will help avoid the tragedy of stu-
dent loan default. 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
KENDRA 
HORN for sharing my concerns on this 
issue and for cosponsoring this amend-
ment. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to support the amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I 
claim the time in opposition, although 
I am not opposed to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, as I 
said in the previous statement, this 
study would have been helpful to have 
informed our analysis prior to drafting 
and debating this bill. 
But there is a broader theme funda-
mental to this amendment and many of 
the amendments that will be offered 
later in this debate: My Democrat col-
leagues are not fully satisfied with 
their effort back in 2010 that national-
ized the student loan program. They 
are coming back for the final 8 percent. 
It was the Democrat Congress and 
Democrat President that nationalized 
the student loan marketplace, and now 
they want to do away with this small 
portion, the 8 percent of the market-
place, that is private student lending. 
In 
fact, 
the 
private 
educational 
loans, while only 8 percent of the mar-
ket, if you look at how they perform, 
they have a 98 percent repayment rate, 
which is far better than the national-
ized 92 percent of the student loan mar-
ketplace. Meanwhile, Federal student 
loan default rates are in the double dig-
its. 
This is simply an attempt to gather 
data to be used to make it more dif-
ficult for private lenders to compete in 
the student loan market. 
The fact is the underlying bill still 
removes important predictive informa-
tion from consumer credit reports that 
helps lenders assess a borrower’s abil-
ity to repay. 
b 1430 
The underlying bill will weaken un-
derwriting standards and make credit 
more expensive, especially for those 
who are on the margins, ultimately 
harming the very consumers we want 
to help. 
As I said, I am not opposed to the 
amendment. More data is useful and 
good, and the GAO provides a wonder-
ful resource for Congress in this data 
collection. So with that, as I said, more 
data is useful. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms. SHALALA). 
The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. TIMMONS) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from South Carolina. 
Mr. 
TIMMONS. 
Mr. 
Chair, 
my 
amendment is simple. It would require 
the GAO to carry out a study on the 
compliance 
of 
consumer 
reporting 
agencies with the underlying legisla-
tion proposed by my colleague from 
Massachusetts. It would also study 
what effect the compliance of reporting 
agencies would have on consumers. 
This is important because if this bill 
were somehow able to become law, the 
results would be disastrous not only for 
reporting agencies but also for the av-
erage consumer. 
The purpose of a credit score is to 
show an individual’s creditworthiness. 
This bill would significantly water 
down the integrity of these credit 
scores. 
If you are removing predictive data, 
if you are drastically shortening the 
amount of time adverse yet accurate 
information remains on a report, and if 
you remove medical debt from a re-
port, then what exactly is the purpose 
of a credit score? What will a credit 
score be good for if this bill were to be-
come law? 
The bottom line is this bill would sig-
nificantly weaken the process for de-
termining creditworthiness and would 
enable individuals to obtain loans that 
they do not have the means to pay 
back. 
It would also give the CFPB, an un-
accountable government agency, con-
trol over private credit scoring models. 
It is imperative that we know ex-
actly how compliance with this bill 
would affect reporting agencies and, as 
a result, consumers. 
Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues 
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment, even though I am not op-
posed to it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Florida is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
As we know, the three major credit 
rating agencies, Equifax, Experian, and 
TransUnion, retain credit profile infor-
mation on more than 200 million Amer-
icans. 
The underlying bill represents a com-
prehensive reform of our Nation’s cred-
it reporting system. This amendment 
would direct the GAO to review just 
how well the credit reporting agencies 
are complying with these new require-
ments and how that affects consumers. 
We know that the credit reporting 
agencies have not been complying with 
the law today. For example, the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act contains provi-
sions requiring credit reports to be ac-
curate, but it is estimated that more 
than 42 million Americans have inac-
curate credit reports. 
The credit reporting agencies need to 
do better by consumers, and if they 
did, perhaps consumer reporting prob-
lems would not consistently rank in 
the top three of consumer complaints 
to the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau. 
Mr. Chair, I support this study. If 
adopted, I hope that Mr. TIMMONS 
would also support the underlying bill. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TIMMONS. Mr. Chair, I would in-
quire how much time is remaining. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from South Carolina has 31⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. TIMMONS. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY), the ranking 
member. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I thank 
my colleague from South Carolina, the 
second newest member of the Financial 
Services Committee, for offering this 
good, thoughtful amendment. 
This amendment will give us a better 
picture of the consent orders that im-
pact credit reporting agencies, includ-
ing the CFPB’s consent orders related 
to marketing and sale of services. 
This is a good amendment in what is 
otherwise a bad bill. 
Often in legislating, we try to make 
bad bills less bad or not-so-good bills 
good, but I am grateful that Mr. 
TIMMONS offered this amendment and 
grateful 
for 
his 
participation 
rep-
resenting upstate South Carolina and 
being a sound policymaker. 
Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to

Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, I

Mr. Chair, in closing, I urge all of my 
colleagues to support this amendment,

Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s–2), as added by sub-
section (a). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. CLAY) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Missouri. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-
port of my amendment. 
This amendment would clarify the 
law for reporting certain positive con-
sumer credit information to the credit 
reporting agencies and seeks to expand 
access to credit through the use of al-
ternative data. 
In addition, this amendment address-
es several concerns identified by con-
sumer advocates, including removing a 
provision that would have preempted 
State laws and ensuring consumers 
provide written consent if their utility 
or rental history is to be considered. 
Also, the bill requires a 2-year study 
and report from GAO on the impact of 
furnishing 
additional 
information, 
which will help us gather data to fur-
ther ensure that American consumers 
have the tools they need to obtain and 
improve credit and that policymakers 
can continue to work to make improve-
ments to the law. 
The way in which alternative data is 
used is important. One of the most im-
portant factors is consumer choice. If 
the use of alternative data is truly vol-
untary—that 
is, 
consumers 
make 
knowing and voluntary decisions to 
allow the use of the data, and the infor-
mation is used only for that limited 
purpose and in ways that consumers 
would expect—then it is much more 
likely to be helpful. 
I am pleased to have the support of 
the National Consumer Law Center on 
this important provision. They support 
it because, unlike prior versions, it 
would permit the reporting of utility 
and rental payment information only 
when the consumer has provided writ-
ten authorization, that is, only when 
the consumer chooses to. 
In the critical area of lending, it is 
estimated that the use of alternative 
data by lenders could expand access to 
credit to over 40 million consumers in 
the United States. Imagine the eco-
nomic activity that would generate. 
As internet access increases and data 
becomes more readily available, mar-
ketplace or fintech leaders mostly rely 
on online platforms and frequently un-
derwrite loans using alternative data. 
Despite fintech lending serving a small 
part of the consumer lending market, 
it continues to grow at a rapid rate. 
That is why it is critical that con-
sumers have as much control over the 
use of their data as possible. In fact, 
according to the GAO, since 2013, per-
sonal loans provided by fintech lenders 
tripled to about $17.7 billion by 2017. 
Alternative data used in credit scor-
ing could potentially increase accu-
racy, visibility, and scorability in cred-
it reporting by including additional in-
formation beyond that which is con-
ventionally used by loan officers. 
I would add that my amendment does 
not preempt State consumer protection 
laws protecting the privacy of utility 
customers and hindering States from 
regulating tenant screening agencies. 
This is important to the regulation and 
monitoring of traditional and fintech 
firms. At times, States have a better 
view than the Federal regulators. 
Lastly, the two largest populations 
of credit invisibles and unscorables are 
either African American or Hispanic 
millennials who live in lower income 
neighborhoods like those that I rep-
resent in north St. Louis. These popu-
lations are especially vulnerable to 
predatory lenders and other unscrupu-
lous lenders. 
Mr. Chair, it is time we try this new 
method to help millions of Americans 
improve their credit scores. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Arkansas is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair, it 
doesn’t bring me pleasure to claim the 
time in opposition to my good friend 
from Missouri, and he knows how much 
I appreciate the work he has done on 
this matter. 
The amendment is certainly, Mr. 
Chair, well intentioned, but as cur-
rently drafted, I would argue that this 
language does more harm to consumers 
than good. 
Let me step back and say that, unre-
lated to Mr. CLAY’s amendment, I in-
troduced H.R. 4231, the Credit Access 
and Inclusion Act, which expands con-
sumers’ access to credit by allowing 
them to use their rent, utility, and 
telecom payments to help build their 
credit scores. In other words, it would 
help more people have access to credit 
with those additional facts. 
As my friend noted, and as we have 
heard in our Task Force on Financial 
Technology and in the Financial Serv-
ices Committee’s Consumer Protection 
and 
Financial 
Institutions 
Sub-
committee, additional data allows mil-
lions more to have access to the credit 
they need. 
This bill, the Credit Access and In-
clusion Act, was introduced in the 
114th Congress and the 115th Congress 
by my friend, former Representative 
Keith Ellison of Minnesota. I joined in 
the last Congress with him and cospon-
sored it, and in the 116th, I have intro-
duced it. 
So I find it interesting that in the 
last two Congresses, my bill was the 
appropriate way to handle additional 
data, but in this Congress, it is not. 
Mr. Chair, I would also raise the 
point that there is a bipartisan Senate 
companion to my bill introduced by 
Senators SCOTT and MANCHIN. 
b 1445 
Furthermore, the language I have in-
troduced was offered as an amendment 
to this bill by GWEN MOORE but was 
ruled out of order in the Rules Com-
mittee. 
As I have outlined, H.R. 4231, my leg-
islation, has strong, bipartisan, bi-
cameral support. I believe Mr. CLAY is 
trying to do something similar with 
the text he has offered today. But in 
my view, his version makes it more dif-
ficult for consumers to establish a 
credit history which is underscored by 
the lack of bipartisan and bicameral 
support for this text. 
As drafted, Mr. CLAY’s amendment 
creates a new barrier because it re-
quires written consumer authorization 
before furnishing a customer’s pay-
ment information to a consumer re-
porting agency for a lease, for a utility, 
or for a telecom service. This is in 
stark contrast with how the current 
credit reporting methodology works. 
This amendment requires consumers 
to opt-in to have their rental, utility, 
or telecommunication payments in-
cluded in their credit reports. I believe 
that is a defective viewpoint. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, just in quick 
response to my friend from Arkansas, 
some consumer advocates have ex-
pressed concern that consumers may be 
evaluated as higher risk for using al-
ternative data than they would be with 
no reports at all; so we worked on this 
language to try to find the sweet spot. 
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the 
gentleman has expired. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair, 
may I ask how much time remains. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Arkansas has 2 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair, let 
me thank Mr. CLAY for his work on 
this. Requiring an opt-in and excluding 
data that would not allow lenders to 
get the full picture of a consumer’s fi-
nancial health, in my view, makes it 
more difficult for consumers to access 
credit because practically no rental, 
utility, or telecommunication compa-
nies would actually furnish the Ex-
panded Access program. 
Therein lies the conundrum here. 
Therein lies the challenge with Mr. 
CLAY’s approach compared to my ap-
proach. But it doesn’t stop me from

thanking my friend for his work on 
this. I know it is an area that we share 
an interest in. I know that this area is 
keenly important to him. 
However, this amendment, as it is 
currently drafted, I cannot support it. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
But I hope my colleague would be open 
to working together to finding a better 
solution that truly benefits consumers, 
expands additional data, and allows 
people to offer these products because 
it will qualify more credit-needy Amer-
icans for badly needed credit. 
I think in the case of Mr. CLAY’s ap-
proach, ‘‘perfect is the enemy of the 
good.’’ I think we ought to work within 
the system that we have and make it 
better. That is why I support my meas-
ure I have introduced in the House and 
oppose this amendment. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chair, I demand a re-
corded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentleman from Missouri will be 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MR. STEIL 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 5 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–383. 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Chair, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 163, beginning on line 5, strike ‘‘(i) ei-
ther—’’ and all that follows through ‘‘(I) the 
person’’ and insert ‘‘(i)(I) the person’’ (and 
adjust the margin of the subsequent sub-
clause accordingly). 
Page 163, line 8, strike ‘‘or’’ at the end. 
Page 163, line 12, add ‘‘or’’ at the end. 
Page 163, after line 12, insert the following: 
‘‘(III) the report is necessary for a back-
ground check or related investigation of fi-
nancial information that is required by a 
Federal, State, or local law or regulation;’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Wisconsin. 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Chair, I rise to urge 
support for my amendment to H.R. 
3621. 
Mr. Chair, I want to start by thank-
ing 
Chairwoman 
WATERS, 
Ranking 
Member 
MCHENRY, 
Representative 
LAWSON, and Representative MCADAMS 
for working with me to reach this com-
monsense agreement on this amend-
ment. 
As my colleagues know, for certain 
jobs, employers are required by law to 
review the financial history of prospec-
tive employees. For instance, in some 
States, insurance commissioners re-
quire companies to review an agent’s 
financial condition and history prior to 
granting a license. 
This is a consumer protection issue. 
It is important to ensure that the pro-
fessionals who consumers trust to 
carry out major financial transactions 
on their behalf aren’t themselves in fi-
nancial distress. 
This amendment clarifies that an 
employer may use a credit report when 
it is necessary for a financial back-
ground check, required by Federal, 
State, or local laws or regulations. 
By clarifying this issue, my amend-
ment ensures that the underlying bill 
does not conflict with important con-
sumer protection laws that are already 
on the books. Failing to address this 
conflict will be bad for workers and 
consumers. 
I again urge support on this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment, although I am not opposed 
to it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, I 
rise to support Mr. STEIL’s and Mr. 
MCADAMS’ amendment. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
this 
bipartisan 
amendment would add clarity to title 
VI of the bill that addresses restricting 
the use of credit reports in most em-
ployment decisions. 
As we know, in many cases, the use 
of credit reports unnecessarily exposes 
consumers’ financial information and 
potentially puts existing employees 
and job applicants in an uncomfortable 
position of having to discuss private 
matters such as: divorce; domestic 
abuse; or health and genetic conditions 
in explaining their impaired credit his-
tory. 
While financial events that cause di-
verse information to land on the credit 
profile do not determine alone what 
value the person can bring to an em-
ployer, there are some circumstances 
where financial background is more 
relevant to a job. 
While this bill already contains ex-
emptions that address this, such as ex-
emptions when the credit file is needed 
for national security, or is otherwise 
required for Federal or State or local 
laws or regulations, we were able to 
draft a bipartisan compromise that 
adds a tailored exemption if Federal, 
State, or local laws or regulations re-
quire an investigation for financial in-
formation of an employee. 
This compromise strikes the right 
balance 
of 
commonsense 
solutions 
without creating loopholes that would 
hurt consumers. 
I want to thank Representative STEIL 
and Representative MCADAMS for their 
work on this, and hope Mr. STEIL will 
vote for the underlying bill if the 
amendment is adopted. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Chair, I appreciate 
my colleague’s remarks regarding this 
amendment. I think this is the com-
monsense solution that we need to 
make sure that employers are pro-
tected as they are looking for their em-
ployees as it relates to this. 
I appreciate the gentleman’s work 
and 
Mr. 
MCADAMS’ 
work 
on 
this 
amendment, and I urge my colleagues’ 
support. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 6 OFFERED BY MR. GOTTHEIMER 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 6 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–383. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chairman, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
In title V, add at the end the following: 
SEC. 503. REVIEW OF CHANGES TO CREDIT SCOR-
ING MODELS. 
Section 631 of the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), as added by sec-
tion 502, is amended by adding at the end the 
following: 
‘‘(c) REVIEW OF CHANGES TO CREDIT SCORING 
MODELS.—With respect to a person that cre-
ates credit scoring models used in making 
credit decisions, if such person creates a new 
credit scoring model (including a revision to 
an existing scoring model) that would, when 
compared to previous credit scoring models 
created by such person, lower the credit 
scores of a class of consumers, the Director 
of the Bureau may review such new credit 
scoring model and, if the Director deter-
mines that such new credit scoring model is 
inappropriate (including, with respect to a 
revision to an existing scoring model, if such 
revision does not enhance or contribute to 
the accuracy and predictive value of the ex-
isting scoring model), the Director may pro-
hibit such new credit scoring model.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support 
of my amendment to H.R. 3621, the 
Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020. 
According to my good friend from 
New Jersey Tom Bracken, who is the 
president and CEO of the New Jersey 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce: 
‘‘Everyone 
needs to be evaluated properly regard-
ing their ability to secure credit.’’ Indi-
viduals want to be confident that the 
due diligence involved in evaluating 
their credit worthiness is accurate. 
Now, here is the problem that my 
amendment is trying to solve, a prob-
lem Americans face every single day. 
There are a handful of credit bureaus

January 29, 2020 
in the United States that are deciding 
Americans’ fate in a black box on 
whether they should get access to cred-
it or not—whether they should get, or 
how much they should be paying for a 
car, a house, a loan to send their chil-
dren to college, a rate on a credit card, 
and how much they can receive for a 
small business loan. 
Houdini himself couldn’t figure out 
how these scores are calculated. And 
here is the rub: Each of these compa-
nies comes up with a magic number, 
your credit score. 
Last week, The New York Times re-
ported that one of the controllers of 
that black box is developing a new 
credit model to decide our financial 
fates in, and that this new model may 
lower the scores for 40 million Ameri-
cans. 
Yes, this new model—just to say this 
again—may lower the scores for 40 mil-
lion Americans who work every single 
day to keep their credit scores high. 
These are hardworking people in our 
communities who are going to be pe-
nalized after spending years doing ev-
erything right. But they are going to 
change those scores based on external 
factors that have nothing to do with 
them and how hard they have worked 
to keep their credit scores up. 
Not only does your score determine 
your ability to obtain credit at a fair 
price, but they are also used by count-
less sectors, from insurance companies 
to landlords and even employers, to de-
cide if you are welcome or not. 
These changes could harm 40 million 
Americans, again, even though they 
have done absolutely nothing wrong. 
These changes could cost people thou-
sands of dollars in higher-priced credit, 
or worse yet, result in the denial of a 
job, apartment rental, or ability to buy 
a home. 
I am focusing on working to expand 
credit access to the millions of credit- 
invisible Americans, consumers who 
have no credit history. 
Now, many of these new credit-
worthy consumers are going to wake 
up and find that the rules they thought 
they were playing by are changing be-
cause of economic forecasts that they 
have no control over. 
My amendment is simple. It will 
allow for a level of oversight to review 
any potential model changes to ensure 
that they are not being done arbi-
trarily, if the changes decrease the 
credit scores for Americans. If it is 
found that there is no justification for 
the changes, the models can be blocked 
from deployment. 
The review is not mandatory, giving 
flexibility for the market to work on 
their own approach to make sure that 
Americans who work hard and care 
about their credit health are not being 
whacked for doing the right thing. 
This amendment is an important 
safeguard for consumers who all too 
often are left holding the bag when it 
comes to their credit scores. 
I am proud to offer this amendment 
today that will protect consumers and 
make sure that no one’s credit scores 
get docked arbitrarily after they have 
played by the rules. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
commonsense amendment. Again, this 
is not about being able to price for risk 
and make sure that we don’t set the 
right scores and rates. This is about ar-
bitrarily 
changing 
someone’s 
score 
simply because there is macro outside 
externalities that have nothing to do 
with them or their behavior, and sud-
denly, they wake up one day and their 
credit scores are really changing their 
lives and having a significant impact 
on them. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from North Carolina is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. 
MCHENRY. 
Mr. 
Chair, 
this 
amendment epitomizes what is wrong 
with the approach taken by the major-
ity in this bill. 
This amendment is about socializing 
credit score models and putting that 
power within the government, and 
clearance from the government in 
order to use different models. 
In short, this amendment says, if you 
don’t like the outcome of something, 
we will just have the CFPB lean in and 
deem it inappropriate. 
That is what it is about. 
This amendment directs the CFPB to 
review the reasons a class of consumers 
may have been negatively impacted by 
a 
newly 
introduced 
credit 
scoring 
model and determine whether the 
model is inappropriate. 
I would say to my colleague, this 
amendment appears to be duplicative 
of the authority already given, already 
vested in the CFPB’s organizational 
statute and in the underlying bill for 
the CFPB to intervene in private-sec-
tor decisions. 
I would also further ask the House: 
Do we really want to give a govern-
ment agency veto power over new cred-
it models? 
b 1500 
As I raised in our committee markup, 
as I raised in our hearing back in Feb-
ruary, and as I have raised on this day 
here on the House floor and many 
times before, I have concerns about the 
consumer credit reporting agencies and 
their structure. I think there is a way 
for us to have a bipartisan consensus. 
While I respect my colleague on the 
other side of the aisle, and there are 
times when we can work together, this 
is not one of those times. I see this is 
as further vesting governmental power 
in something that the private sector 
should be deciding in the private-sector 
allocation of risk, rather than social-
izing credit models. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chairman, I 
want to thank the ranking member for 
his leadership. We work together quite 
often, and I know we disagree on this 
one. 
The challenge I have here is you have 
just a couple companies that control, 
through this black box, all this infor-
mation that no one can figure out how 
they get your score and how the score 
is developed. It is completely arbi-
trary. 
People are working really hard to try 
to get their scores up so they can get a 
loan, so they can get a mortgage, and 
just to make their lives better. They 
work really hard at it. It just doesn’t 
make any sense to me to have this ar-
bitrary change in the number that no 
one can understand. Again, you just 
have a few people sitting in a room 
somewhere making this decision. 
The idea would be to make sure there 
is some sort of review, so that if a few 
people just go make this decision with-
out any real competition—I am a pro- 
business Democrat—they go off and 
make this decision in this room some-
where, it really can affect every aspect 
of your life. Suddenly your credit goes 
down, and now they want to bring your 
credit down again, these credit scores 
down and change the number, with 
nothing to do with your own behavior 
at all. It is just that they decided this 
on externalities. 
So I agree with the ranking member 
that we should always make sure that 
we are circumspect here and we allow 
the markets to play out. But in this 
case, this isn’t the market with com-
petition. 
In this case it is arbitrary, and there 
should be review. In the review you can 
have a perfect review and in the end it 
would be that, okay, this makes sense. 
I can see why we need to make these 
changes. I understand why we need to 
do this. And, of course, price for the 
risk here, and that makes sense. 
But in this case you can’t just be 
someone in the back room making a 
decision and then you wake up one day, 
you have done nothing wrong and they 
had a huge impact on how much you 
are paying for your credit, how much 
you are paying to take out a loan, if 
you own a small business to take out a 
loan, or get a lease for a car, things 
that affect your life every single day. 
That is really what we are talking 
about here. 
So I appreciate the ranking member’s 
concerns, but I think in this case it is 
very focused. It is to really ensure that 
you don’t have an oligopoly with all 
control. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, as I 
said, this amendment is about social-
izing credit modeling. My colleague 
raised this issue that a few people in a 
room are making a decision that will 
affect millions of Americans. 
I think the consumer credit reporting 
agencies are deeply problematic. There 
is not real competition. When you have 
three 
controlling 
this 
marketplace 
with very little competition, the varied

entries being massive because it is 
heavily regulated by government, a set 
of laws that act on them and regula-
tions that act on them, that is prob-
lematic. It is an oligopoly. 
I have said that I think there are rea-
sonable reforms that we could achieve 
in a bipartisan way through this House 
that could make it into law. This bill is 
dead on arrival in the Senate, and the 
President said he is going to veto it. 
This is not a bipartisan undertaking. 
In fact, instead of having that private- 
sector, behind-closed-doors group mak-
ing this decision, you vest one govern-
ment bureau with somebody under 
statute who is appointed, who cannot 
be fired, who can show up drunk at 
work basically, and the President 
doesn’t have the authority to fire them 
under the statute, and you are going to 
give the CFPB this power and have a 
single director make this decision on 
the allocation of credit for all Ameri-
cans? 
So private sector, a small group mak-
ing a decision and you have three 
choices for your credit scores. Or do 
you want to have one government bu-
reaucrat make all the decisions for the 
American people? 
So this is a fundamental debate, not 
just here on the House floor but on 
wider politics about how you allocate 
capital in the United States: Is it the 
government that should do this? Or 
should it be individual action and indi-
vidual citizens who have that control? 
I fundamentally believe it is the indi-
vidual citizens not government bureau-
crats behind closed doors who are mak-
ing those decisions. We need real inno-
vation for consumer credit scores and 
consumer credit modeling. We need big 
data involved, we need machine learn-
ing, and we need to make sure that we 
root out inherent bias within the data 
sources. I think there are enormous 
things we can do. But investing in a 
government bureau that is unaccount-
able and a single director that is mak-
ing these decisions is a worse outcome 
than what is already not that great. 
So I appreciate my colleague raising 
this issue because we both agree this is 
a problem. We just haven’t been able to 
come to terms with how to do it. 
So while I oppose this amendment, I 
certainly respect my colleague from 
New Jersey as a serious policy maker, 
but on this we just don’t agree. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. MCHENRY. I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chairman, it 
sounds like we are finding a place of 
common ground here where we cer-
tainly need more competition in this 
space, and the fact that the gentleman 
said big data and other externalities 
being brought to bear, I am looking 
forward to working with him on that 
because I think certainly we have got 
to make this better. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, as I 
said, my colleague is a serious policy 
maker. At times we can come together, 
at other times we see things dif-
ferently, and I think that is okay. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 7 OFFERED BY MR. KILDEE 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 7 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–383. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 134, line 25, before ‘‘in an area’’ insert 
‘‘or works’’. 
Page 135, beginning on line 5, strike ‘‘the 
date that is 3 months after such date.’’ and 
insert the following: ‘‘the date that is the 
earlier of— 
‘‘(i) 6 months after the date on which the 
major disaster or emergency was declared; 
and 
‘‘(ii) the later of— 
‘‘(I) 3 months after the date on which the 
major disaster or emergency was declared; 
and 
‘‘(II) the date that the Director of the Bu-
reau, in consultation with the Administrator 
of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, determines is the date on which sub-
stantially all provision of assistance by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency 
under such major disaster or emergency dec-
laration has concluded.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
Congresswoman AYANNA PRESSLEY and 
Chairwoman MAXINE WATERS for their 
leadership on this legislation and for 
advocating for consumers. 
The credit reporting system in this 
country is not consumer focused and is 
in need of a major overhaul. 
Consumer complaints about their 
credit reports are one of the most fre-
quently reported issues submitted to 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau. Over 40 million Americans have 
errors in their credit reports. In fact, 
just last week one credit reporting 
company announced it was changing 
the credit scoring model which could 
arbitrarily reduce credit scores for mil-
lions of Americans without allowing 
any public input whatsoever. 
Having poor credit makes it harder 
and more expensive to borrow money, 
buy a home, or own a car. It also nega-
tively impacts a person’s ability to be 
approved for an apartment, get car in-
surance, and even to get a job. The 
lack of transparency and accuracy in 
the credit reporting system leaves bor-
rowers at the mercy of credit reporting 
agencies, which is holding American 
families back. 
The Comprehensive CREDIT Act is a 
much-needed, comprehensive overhaul 
of the credit reporting system. This 
bill would enhance consumer rights 
and increase the accountability and 
transparency of consumer reporting 
agencies. 
Specifically, the bill would help reha-
bilitate credit for student borrowers 
with private loans. Right now Ameri-
cans are experiencing a student loan 
debt crisis. Student loan debt is now at 
$1.3 trillion. This is the largest source 
of debt in the U.S., even more than 
credit card debt. This is delaying 
young people from making critical in-
vestments in their own future like buy-
ing a house, starting a family, or sav-
ing for their own children to go to col-
lege. 
The 
Comprehensive 
CREDIT 
Act 
would combat this by requiring a cred-
it reporting agency to remove a delin-
quent or defaulted private education 
loan on a borrower’s consumer report if 
they have shown a good history of loan 
repayment for 10 consecutive months 
after the delinquency or default. If a 
borrower has demonstrated a good 
faith effort to resume loan repayment 
after a delinquency or default, then 
they should not be punished with a 
lowered credit score. 
I also support the underlying legisla-
tion very strongly, and I have intro-
duced an amendment that I think 
would strengthen the bill even further. 
My amendment would provide a 6- 
month grace period to preserve the 
credit score of borrowers living and 
working in an area impacted by a 
major disaster or emergency if there is 
an interruption in their 10 consecutive 
months of loan repayment. 
In 2016 in my own hometown, the peo-
ple of Flint experienced a drinking 
water emergency. I know many of you 
have heard me discuss this on many oc-
casions. During that period people were 
not able to access safe drinking water, 
families were saddled with unexpected 
medical bills, parents and children 
poisoned by their water experienced ad-
verse health conditions, and home-
owners and businesses were negatively 
affected. 
People whose livelihoods were dam-
aged by this crisis or any other natural 
disaster or emergency should not be pe-
nalized for failing to pay back student 
loans until they get back on their feet. 
When experiencing a crisis, borrowers 
should be provided flexibility to repay 
their loans when they are able to with-
out affecting their underlying credit 
score. This relief would be provided to 
people living and working in an area 
experiencing a major disaster or emer-
gency. 
My amendment and the underlying 
bill will help decrease the burden of 
student loans on Americans and im-
prove their credit scores, especially 
those people living in areas impacted 
by emergencies or natural disasters. 
Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I 
claim the time in opposition.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H688 
January 29, 2020 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from North Carolina is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I want 
to commend my colleague, Mr. KILDEE, 
for representing his constituents’ in-
terests. The people in this Chamber 
know of his commitment to his neigh-
bors in Flint, and he has been quite 
vocal 
and 
passionate 
about 
their 
plight. He has brought that debate here 
to the House floor in a very proper and 
good way, so he should be commended 
for that, I believe. 
We know that when you have a local 
concern like this you want to fix it. So 
many times when you have something 
that is applicable at the national level 
you learn from local circumstances. 
So let’s look at the underlying bill 
first in order to describe this. What 
this bill says to the 8 percent of the 
student loan marketplace—8 percent— 
this has nothing to do with the 92 per-
cent that is controlled by the Federal 
Government. That is an Education and 
Labor Committee of jurisdiction and is 
not a part of this bill. 
Eight percent of the student loan 
marketplace is private. Private lenders 
are engaged, and those terms are al-
ready a part of a set of Federal laws 
and State laws. The underlying bill ig-
nores the contractual terms of that, ig-
nores the fact that you have in that 8 
percent of the student loan market-
place only 2 percent who are not pay-
ing or in default. Ninety-eight percent 
are paying. So my friend is trying to 
fix a problem on 2 percent. The Federal 
student loan portfolio has double-digit 
default rates and folks not paying. 
So we have a big issue here. It is a 
big societal issue. It is impacting two 
generations of Americans, and it is be-
cause Congress has passed bad law that 
is saddling and enabling a generation 
of students to saddle themselves with 
debt that they cannot repay. It is un-
conscionable what we have done. 
So what that bill does is say to that 
8 percent of the marketplace: If you are 
behind—8 percent of the marketplace, 2 
percent not paying or in default. So 
let’s go to that 2 percent. 
We are saying: If you have been in de-
fault for months, perhaps years, and 
you make payments, and over 10 
months you make nine of 10—why? 
Well, I couldn’t determine during com-
mittee debate why it was nine. Why 
not 11 of 12? Why not 5 of 6? Why not 
three of seven? Nine of ten, because 
that was the determination we have 
gotten. And now we have an amend-
ment that says, nine of ten? Well, 
maybe a little different. 
So I get the expression of resolve for 
fixing people’s problems, but this bill is 
really bad. It is a really fundamentally 
flawed bill when you have these arbi-
trary timelines like this and it says 
you sort of pay and you sort of pay for 
a period of time and then all that fact 
that you didn’t pay is just waved away. 
So that is the absurdity of the under-
lying bill. 
I say to Mr. KILDEE, I am sorry to 
take up the debate to talk about how 
flawed that is. The gentleman’s expres-
sion, though, about natural disasters is 
a reasonable one. If we can do a stand-
alone bill on that then I think we 
would have not a dissenting vote on 
the House floor. So I would love to 
work with the gentleman on that, but 
I cannot support this amendment, and 
I have to oppose it. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
b 1515 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I appre-
ciate my friend’s expression. We served 
together my first 6 years on the Finan-
cial Services Committee. And if the 
event occurs that we need to pursue 
this relief in another fashion, I would 
look to forward to working with him. 
But it is my hope that we can act on 
this within this legislation. 
I do disagree with his assessment of 
the underlying legislation, but that is 
fine. That is the nature of this place, 
that we have disagreements sometimes 
over issues like this. 
In this case, where we do have a 
chance, as the gentleman described, to 
deal 
with 
a 
specific 
set 
of 
cir-
cumstances affecting specific individ-
uals, we ought to take that oppor-
tunity and do something. 
I didn’t know when I was elected that 
the community that I represent was 
going to face the crisis that it did, and 
nobody serving in this body knows 
whether or not their community, in 
the next month or year or 10 years, will 
face a similar circumstance. 
So let’s take the opportunity we 
have, as small as it may be in terms of 
the way the gentleman describes it. It 
is not small when it happens to you, 
and it is not small when it happens to 
your community. 
So I appreciate the gentleman’s will-
ingness to work with me in the future 
on this. I ask my colleagues to join me 
in supporting this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire how much time remains. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from North Carolina has 1 minute re-
maining. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I would 
say to the gentleman from Michigan 
that I commend him for offering this 
amendment; I commend him for the re-
spect for this institution and how he 
interacts legislatively. He can be pas-
sionate about representing his con-
stituents, his point of view, his legisla-
tion, his amendments, but, at the same 
time, where we can come to terms, we 
do that on a regular basis. 
So it is not all dysfunction here; it is 
not all dismay; it is not all disaster; it 
is not all acrimony. There are those of 
us who can still talk amidst a broken 
and divided government that we have. 
So I commend him for offering this 
amendment, and, again, as I said, I am 
opposed to the amendment. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 8 OFFERED BY MR. KING OF 
IOWA 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 8 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–383. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I 
have an amendment at the desk made 
in order by the rule. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 135, beginning on line 3, strike ‘‘date 
on which the major disaster or emergency 
was declared’’ and insert ‘‘initial date of the 
incident period of the major disaster or 
emergency’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from Iowa (Mr. KING) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Iowa. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, 
this amendment, in reading through 
the bill, brings something forward that 
we have experienced a number of times 
in the natural disasters that have 
poured forth and the flooding in my 
district over the 17 years-plus that I 
have represented the folks in the Mis-
souri River bottom, in particular; but, 
also, it affects everybody else around 
the country. 
In reading the base bill, it says that 
the 3-month grace period that is grant-
ed for a student loan begins on the date 
that the declaration of disaster is 
issued, and often that declaration of 
disaster is issued sometimes months 
after the disaster is over. 
The crisis is also over for the former 
student who was paying their student 
loans and having difficulty meeting 
those obligations because they have 
been the victim of a natural disaster, 
whether it be a hurricane, whether it 
be a flood, whether it be a tornado or 
some other type of natural disaster. 
This morning, I saw there was an 
earthquake down across from Florida, 
across the Caribbean. 
What this amendment does is move 
that date back to the initial date of the 
disaster itself rather than the date 
that it was declared a disaster. The 
language in the current bill says, ‘‘date 
on which the major disaster or emer-
gency was declared.’’ Instead, the lan-
guage becomes, ‘‘initial date of the in-
cident period of the major disaster or 
emergency.’’ 
Mr. Chairman, I would point out 
some of these dates along the way that 
stand out to me. 
There was flooding in North Dakota 
that began on October 9 of 2019 and 
continued until October 26 of 2019. That 
disaster was declared not then, but de-
clared on January 21, 2020. That would 
have been the first date that the grace 
period would kick in under this lan-
guage. I ask that that grace period 
kick in immediately. Although the an-
nouncement will come from FEMA and 
wouldn’t be on the first day of the dis-
aster, that is the first day that they 
feel the financial stress.

I will go through a number of these. 
The courageous people of Hornick, 
Iowa, bounced back from that flood as 
strongly as anybody I have seen, but 
that began on March 12, and the dis-
aster declaration came March 23. So 
they lost some of those days. 
And I look down to Tropical Storm 
Michael in North Carolina, and that 
disaster began October 10 to 12, 2018, 
and 4 months later, January 31, 2019, 
was the declaration. 
So the credit of these people who are 
trying diligently to pay their student 
loans is damaged unless they have this 
grace period that begins when the 
stress period begins, and that is what 
my amendment does, Mr. Chairman, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition, al-
though I am not opposed. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Florida is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chair-
man, this amendment will allow for 
more time for private student loan bor-
rowers in the process of rehabilitating 
their loans to repay their loans when 
also impacted by a geographical dis-
aster or emergency. 
By changing the language from when 
a disaster or emergency is federally de-
clared to when the actual disaster 
began, private student loan borrowers 
will have more time outside of when an 
emergency is officially federally de-
clared to explain and have their situa-
tion taken into consideration for hard-
ship. 
For example, it was a shame that it 
took President Trump more than 2 
weeks to declare the major disaster 
declaration after Puerto Rico received 
a string of earthquakes beginning De-
cember 28. Consumers should not be pe-
nalized by politics when they are in 
dire need for help. 
As climate change and other disas-
ters continue to have devastating con-
sequences across this country, students 
who are demonstrating that they can 
rehabilitate their loans and improve 
their credit scores should not have to 
additionally suffer because extreme 
events like these cause hardships that 
would reasonably interrupt a payment. 
It can take years for communities to 
recover from natural and other disas-
ters, and this amendment further al-
lows victims of these disasters the time 
that they deserve, a fair chance to im-
prove their credit scores and future 
credit opportunities. 
I support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, 
may I inquire as to how much time re-
mains. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Iowa has 21⁄4 minutes remaining. 
The gentleman from Florida has 3 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I appreciate the gentleman’s remarks 
with regard to this amendment. 
I would point out that we have 435 
Members in this United States Con-
gress, and it was envisioned by our 
Founding Fathers that we would get 
ideas from every one of those districts. 
And they also recognized that we are 
all human, and no matter how diligent 
we might be, no matter how much we 
care about the people we are helping, 
sometimes things just kind of slide 
along, look good on the surface, and we 
are busy. So that is why we all want to 
look at this, and that is why I have the 
privilege to be here to offer this 
amendment. 
Having gone through natural disaster 
after natural disaster after natural dis-
aster, suffered from them myself—in 
fact, the 1993 flood is probably why I 
am in Congress today, because I real-
ized the degree of risk was not propor-
tional to the potential for profit if you 
are under water. 
So I want to help those students who 
want to keep their credit in line, and I 
appreciate the support across Congress 
to do so. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I 
appreciate the gentleman’s remarks 
again, and I would just point out that, 
of this list of disasters that we have 
and the delays we have in declaring 
these disasters, there is one here on 
April 29. 
A disaster declaration was declared 
for severe storms and flooding within 
the Sac and Fox Tribe in Mississippi 
and Iowa—and I actually live in Sac 
County, although that is not part of 
that reservation—with an incident pe-
riod spanning March 13 till April 1. 
However, the disaster declaration was 
April 29, so there was a month-and-a- 
half delay in that one. 
I have other examples of this, Mr. 
Chairman, but I think that we have 
made our point here today, and I appre-
ciate the attendance and diligence of 
the Members on both sides of the aisle. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Iowa (Mr. KING). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 9 OFFERED BY MS. SA´ NCHEZ 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 9 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–383. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Chairman, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-

TIVE DUTY UNIFORMED CONSUMER.—With re-
spect to an item of adverse information

AMENDMENT.—The Fair 
Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) 
is amended by striking ‘‘active duty mili-

(e) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that any person making use of a 
consumer report containing an item of ad-
verse information should, if the action or in-
action that gave rise to the item occurred 
while the consumer was an extended active 
duty uniformed consumer, take such fact 
into account when evaluating the credit-
worthiness of the consumer. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. SA´ NCHEZ) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I am proud to vote today to protect 
consumers and improve our credit re-
porting system. 
I thank Chairwoman WATERS
and 
Representative PRESSLEY for their hard 
work on this important legislative 
package, and I want to thank the Fi-
nancial Services staff who have worked 
diligently behind the scenes. 
I would also like to thank the Na-
tional Military Family Association, 
the National Consumer Law Center, 
and the Consumer Federation of Amer-
ica for their support of my amendment. 
My amendment today, which is based 
upon a bill that I have long cham-
pioned, is focused on our friends and 
family in uniform who are serving 
abroad. Specifically, my amendment 
would allow servicemembers the abil-
ity to dispute negative information, or 
dings, on their credit report that oc-
curred while they were serving in a 
combat zone or aboard a U.S. vessel. 
Those who are serving in the Army, 
Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast 
Guard, National Guard, the commis-
sioned corps of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration, and 
the Public Health Service would ben-
efit from this amendment. 
This amendment isn’t without guard-
rails. A credit reporting agency must 
be notified that the servicemember was 
on extended Active Duty at the time 
the hit to the credit report occurred. 
The credit reporting agency would then 
be required to conduct a review of the 
information and delete any negative 
information from the credit report 
should certain requirements be met. 
We must acknowledge the realities of 
deployment in today’s technological 
world. Life goes on at home while our 
military members are deployed. Some-
times a bill payment is missed when an 
electronic payment agreement lapses, 
a credit card on file expires, or an un-
authorized credit card is issued. 
This amendment allows for credit re-
ports that more accurately reflect the 
full picture. This idea was born out of 
the incredible courage of two parents 
who faced an overwhelming grief that I 
hope never to experience. 
John Kelsall, president of my local 
chamber of commerce at the time, and 
his wife, Teri, a long-time southern 
California nonprofit leader, lost their 
son. 
Lieutenant 
Commander 
Jonas 
Kelsall, a proud Navy SEAL, was killed 
in Afghanistan in 2011. In order to keep 
their son’s legacy alive, the Kelsalls 
founded a nonprofit veterans business 
incubator to assist U.S. military vet-
erans upon their return to civilian life. 
Whenever I was back home, John and 
Teri would catch me up on the latest 
challenges and success stories from 
their organization. However, one hur-
dle kept coming up over and over and 
over again for these veteran would-be 
entrepreneurs. 
b 1530 
Terri and John shared stories of serv-
icemembers and veterans who had 
trouble obtaining loans to help start 
their businesses. Why? Because while 
they were deployed, they missed pay-
ments, and this negatively affected 
their credit scores, even though, often-
times, the delays were out of their con-
trol. 
I knew something had to be done. 
That is why, in 2014, I joined our col-
league, Congressman LAMBORN of Colo-
rado, in introducing legislation to ad-
dress this problem. I have been proud 
to strengthen the text of this bill over 
the years with the help of the National 
Consumer Law Center and military 
family support groups. Our country 
continues to ask so much from our men 
and women who serve in uniform. They 
deserve peace of mind during their Ac-
tive Duty deployments. 
Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues 
to support this amendment and the un-
derlying legislative package, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim 
the time in opposition, but I am not 
opposed to it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, this 
amendment introduces to the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act a definition for 
Active Duty uniformed consumer and 
establishes a special regime for the 
treatment of such consumers. 
It is understandable and commend-
able that we want to help the men and 
women who serve our country. They 
are involved in unique circumstances, 
not just here domestically but glob-
ally. 
While I support the need for our serv-
icemen 
and 
women 
broadly, 
this 
amendment does not remedy the over-
arching issues in the underlying bill. 
There are some deeply problematic 
pieces to this bill, as I have said in this 
overall debate. Because of that, I would 
offer to work with the gentlewoman on 
this as a standalone measure that I be-
lieve we could pass with a wide major-
ity through the House. Who knows in 
the Senate, given these days. But I be-
lieve that it would even have the op-
portunity for the President’s signature, 
which is important for our process here 
in lawmaking. 
Unfortunately, the overall bill, even 
if this is added, won’t see the light of 
day because the Senate is not going to 
take it up, and the President has al-
ready said he is going to veto it. 
Mr. Chair, I would offer to the gentle-
woman to work with her on a stand-
alone measure to achieve the very 
thing of her amendment. I am happy to 
yield if she has a response or if she is 
interested in working in a bipartisan 
way for a standalone measure to 
achieve this. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
California. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Chair, I thank 
my colleague for the offer to work on 
this as a standalone bill. It was origi-
nally a standalone bill. It is being of-
fered as an amendment to the bill. I 
understand that you have reservations 
on the underlying bill. 
My hope is that it will pass as an 
amendment and that the underlying 
bill will pass. But should that bill not 
be successful in being taken up in the 
Senate, I would surely love to work 
with my colleague on a standalone bill 
that will accomplish this very impor-
tant goal of helping our men and 
women who serve in uniform make 
their lives just a little bit easier. 
We ask a lot of them as a Nation, and 
so I think helping them when they are 
on Active Duty and sometimes are late 
or miss payments is a worthwhile en-
deavor. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, reclaim-
ing my time, I appreciate the offer and 
would be happy to work with the gen-
tlewoman on that standalone measure. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Chair, again, I 
want to say that I have attempted to 
pass this bill as a standalone bill. I be-
lieve that it is properly included in the 
underlying bill, which I think is an ex-
cellent piece of legislation. 
Our country asks a lot of our men 
and women, and while you are on Ac-
tive Duty, the last thing that you 
should worry about is late payments or 
missed payments, oftentimes because 
you are in far-flung regions of the 
world when it is not like you can just 
mail a letter back to make sure that 
your payment gets in on time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H691 
January 29, 2020 
Mr. Chair, I believe very strongly in 
this amendment. I ask my colleagues 
to support the amendment and support 
the underlying bill. I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
SA´ NCHEZ). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 10 OFFERED BY MR. COHEN 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 10 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–383. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, as I have an 
amendment at the desk, I stand and 
seek recognition. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 137, line 16, insert before the period 
the following: ‘‘as soon as possible, but in no 
case later than 5 days after such comple-
tion’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Tennessee. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, this amend-
ment creates a specific time period for 
credit reporting agencies to change a 
consumer’s credit report after consecu-
tive payments have been made on cer-
tain private education loans. 
This bill offers credit rehabilitation 
for distressed private education loan 
borrowers. 
My 
amendment 
simply 
states that once a consumer has made 
the consecutive payments outlined in 
the standardized reporting codes, the 
consumer reporting agency must up-
date a consumer’s report immediately 
or within 5 business days, at the most. 
Credit reports and credit scores are 
tied to so many important factors in 
consumers’ lives. They determine in-
terest rates on mortgages, bank loans, 
and credit cards, and deposits for rent. 
They can even lower insurance pre-
miums. 
Every 
day 
counts. 
Consumers 
shouldn’t have to wait in limbo, not 
knowing exactly when a charge is 
going to be removed from their credit 
report, especially if they have been 
making 
consecutive 
payments 
and 
meet the criteria to have it removed. 
This amendment is supported by the 
National Consumer Law Center, which 
stated that ‘‘putting a specific time-
frame for compliance is a good idea. It 
provides clarity on what action needs 
to be taken for both compliance and 
enforcement purposes. It also ensures 
borrowers will get the benefits of the 
law promptly.’’ 
Mr. 
Chair, 
I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
WATERS, Mr. LAWSON, Congresswoman 
PRESSLEY, and the Financial Services 
Committee 
staff—especially 
Yana 
Miles, Glen Sears, Avy Malik, Clement 
Abonyi, and Lisa Peto—for all of their 
hard work on this issue. I encourage 
my colleagues to support this amend-
ment. 
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. 
PRESSLEY), the sponsor of this com-
prehensive bill. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, my bill, 
the Comprehensive CREDIT Act, will 
greatly 
improve 
a 
fundamentally 
flawed credit reporting system, pro-
viding much-needed relief for families 
across the country. 
It works to protect consumers from 
unfair and misleading credit reporting 
practices, affirming the rights of all 
Americans to an equitable and trans-
parent credit reporting process. My bill 
takes the burden off consumers while 
holding credit reporting agencies ac-
countable and restoring fairness to the 
system. 
I thank my colleague from Tennessee 
(Mr. COHEN) for offering this amend-
ment. CRAs are all too quick to add 
penalties and negative marks to credit 
reports, but the same urgency never 
seems to be applied to improving those 
reports. 
Once borrowers take the steps pre-
scribed in this bill to improve their 
credit reports, they deserve to have the 
reports updated to reflect that in a rea-
sonable timeframe. 
Credit scores are meant to be pre-
dictive, and the best predictor of future 
behavior is their most recent behavior. 
Our bill takes the burden off of con-
sumers while holding debt reporting 
agencies accountable and restoring 
fairness to the system. This amend-
ment would further strengthen our bill 
by ensuring that these changes happen 
in a timely manner. 
Mr. Chair, I am proud to support this 
amendment, and I urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim 
time in opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from North Carolina is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, it sounds 
like a bit of a broken record, but this 
amendment does two things. 
First, it continues to undermine the 
ability of private lenders to negotiate 
terms of their loans with student bor-
rowers. Second, it continues the bill’s 
theme of removing negative informa-
tion, even if accurate, from credit 
scores and credit reports. 
Now, it was the decision by a Demo-
cratic 
House, 
Democratic 
Senate, 
Democratic President that has saddled 
a generation—in fact, two genera-
tions—of students with this massive, 
federally administered student loan 
program. 
This bill only deals with the 8 per-
cent that is in the private market-
place. It is trying to put bad rules 
there to take that final 8 percent, when 
in reality we should be focused on the 
92 percent that the Federal Govern-
ment has saddled, the 92 percent that is 
the Federal student loan program. 
They want to remove predictive in-
formation, which will lead to students 
taking on even more debt. We should 
be addressing the underlying factors 
that are causing the crisis, like the ris-
ing costs of higher education, the lack 
of underwriting standards in the Fed-
eral program. 
Instead, we are going to weaken the 
standards in the private market, the 
part of the marketplace that is actu-
ally working really, really well, where 
you only have default rates or folks 
who are not paying at 2 percent or less. 
In the Federal program, we have double 
digits that are in the same sort of cat-
egory. 
The underlying bill requires con-
sumer reporting agencies to develop 
and use reporting codes to reflect a 
borrower’s participation in the credit 
rehabilitation program. The amend-
ment would require these codes to be 
removed no later than 5 days after the 
consumer makes nine payments in 10 
months. 
Why nine payments in 10 months? As 
I said the last time I spoke about this, 
because that kind of feels right, appar-
ently. That is kind of what we deter-
mined in the committee debate. Not 
that people have paid every month but, 
you know, they have paid 9 out of 10 
months. 
What we are talking about here is 
not science in the underlying bill. In 
fact, the 5-day period, I am not sure 
how the sponsor came up with that. 
But this amendment expedites the re-
quirement of a flawed program within 
the bill, so not making a titanic 
change, a major change to the bill. But 
it is a bad program that he is basically 
speeding up, in my view—a bad pro-
gram, in my view—that he is obviously 
trying to enact more quickly. 
Under this amendment, there will be 
no record of the borrower ever being 
delinquent or having been in default. 
Let’s go back to the private loan 
market statistics. Again, 2 percent in 
the private student loan marketplace 
is in default of their loans, compared to 
the Federal student loan program, 
which has a default rate of 18 percent. 
Fannie and Freddie didn’t have a de-
fault rate that high, and they got na-
tionalized as a result of the financial 
crisis and sparked a financial crisis. We 
have 18 percent that is in default in the 
student loan program. 
Why are we messing with this small 
program when we should be taking on 
this bigger issue that is one that is a 
major struggle? There are a lot of ideas 
on both sides of the aisle for how we 
deal with that. 
We shouldn’t be weakening under-
writing standards, either in the Fed-
eral program or in the private pro-
gram. We should have strong under-
writing standards. We should not lead 
to more financial instability but a fair-
ly structured and smart marketplace. 
Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment 
and, again, reiterate that this amend-
ment is about speeding up a bad pro-
gram that is deeply flawed in the un-
derlying bill, and that is why I oppose 
it. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H692 
January 29, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, first of all, 
Federal student loans already have the 
option to rehabilitate the loan after 
the borrower has made 9 out of 10 con-
secutive on-time payments. 
H.R. 3621 simply brings private stu-
dent loans in line with Federal student 
loans, so 9 out of 10. It is not science 
like climate change is, but it is pretty 
good, and it is based on current law for 
Federal student loans. 
Secondly, I would submit, don’t try 
to make the perfect the enemy of the 
good. I was here for 8 years in the mi-
nority, and I don’t remember the ma-
jority bringing any bills to help con-
sumers on any student loans, any 
loans, or anything at all. Fortunately, 
we are in the majority, and we are 
bringing you bills to help consumers, 
and this bill helps people with student 
loans. 
Mr. Chair, I once again reiterate that 
I urge people to support this, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining on 
both sides. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from North Carolina has 30 seconds re-
maining. The gentleman from Ten-
nessee has 11⁄4 minutes. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. Chair, simply, for the college stu-
dents, for the debtors, for fairness, for 
justice, pass this bill, pass this amend-
ment. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Chair, this is more aggressive 
than the bad Federal student loan pro-
gram. If you are a delinquent borrower, 
you cannot access this like-kind pro-
gram. What this amendment is saying 
is, if you are a delinquent borrower, 
you can get in the front of the line and 
get that waived away as if you had 
been paying the whole time. This is a 
bad idea. 
If you want to address the problem, 
let’s address the cost of college, not 
doing this gamesmanship of trying to 
socialize on the back end through cred-
it scores and credit reporting agencies. 
Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
b 1545 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 11 OFFERED BY MR. COHEN 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 11 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–383. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 162, line 15, after ‘‘purposes’’ insert 
the following: ‘‘, including for the purpose of 
denying employment,’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Tennessee. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, first, I would 
just like to make some closing re-
marks on the previous argument. The 
gentleman is right. We need to make 
college more affordable, and I passed a 
bill in Tennessee when I was a senator, 
a referendum on the ballot that has 
raised over $5 billion to send kids to 
college in Tennessee, $5 billion free 
scholarship money. So, yes, I don’t 
talk the talk, I walk the walk. 
Mr. Chairman, my amendment makes 
it unequivocally clear that credit re-
ports should not be used as the sole 
reason for the denial of employment. 
This amendment is for the countless 
constituents who have contacted my 
office with disturbing stories of being 
denied a job opportunity because of 
their credit report. 
This amendment is for the many peo-
ple in this country who are currently 
in a vicious cycle: To pay down their 
debt, they need a job, but they can’t 
get hired because of their debt. 
According to the Society for Human 
Resource Management, 43 percent of 
employers are conducting pre-employ-
ment credit checks, claiming that a po-
tential employee’s credit score is some-
how an accurate predictor of future job 
performance. Nobody says that. Like 
nobody says that you have to have a 
crime in an impeachment article to im-
peach a President. Abuse of power is 
sufficient. 
Yet, there has not been any proof 
that a credit report or a credit score 
can predict how an employee will per-
form, none whatsoever. 
A credit report doesn’t tell the whole 
story. Maybe a person had a long 
stretch of unemployment. Maybe they 
unexpectedly had a health or a medical 
crisis. 
This practice has had a dispropor-
tionate impact on some of our most 
vulnerable, credit-challenged citizens; 
recent college grads, divorced women, 
low-income families, senior citizens, 
and minorities. 
Everyone deserves the opportunity to 
begin rebuilding their credit history by 
obtaining employment. We should be 
doing everything in our power to help 
people find jobs during these tough eco-
nomic times, not hinder them. 
Making sure credit reports are not 
used as a means for denial of employ-
ment has been a very important issue 
to me and my office, and I have intro-
duced a bill, the Equal Employment for 
All Act, every Congress for the last 11 
years. 
Unfortunately, in eight of those 
years, we were in the minority and so 
we couldn’t get a hearing. But now, Mr. 
LAWSON has brought a bill, which I ap-
preciate greatly, and he is on the com-
mittee and this issue is now before us. 
What matters most is that important 
issues like this are addressed and fixed 
by Congress and get to the floor for a 
vote. I would like to thank Mr. 
LAWSON. 
I would also like to go back and 
thank my former staffer, Michael Ful-
ton, who worked tirelessly on the 
Equal Employment for All Act and the 
Fair Access to Credit Scores Act. I am 
happy to see that language to provide 
free credit scores is also included in the 
Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020. 
I want to thank again Chairwoman 
WATERS and the dedicated staff on the 
Financial Services Committee. And I 
encourage all of my colleagues to sup-
port my amendment and vote for the 
overall bill. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim 
the time in opposition. I am opposed to 
the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from North Carolina is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, this 
amendment is more of the same. It pre-
vents employers from identifying and 
fulfilling the needs of their companies. 
Now, use of a credit score, you would 
argue, is not perfect for every job, but 
there are certain cases where that 
would, in fact, be a reasonable thing 
and a reasonable limitation on employ-
ment; and I would ask the amendment 
sponsor if that is the case. 
Are there reasonable limitations that 
we could find here for the types of em-
ployment where a credit report may be 
helpful to an employer? 
I would ask the bill’s sponsor, Mr. 
COHEN of Tennessee, who is here in the 
room, so your amendment says you 
cannot use the credit report for any-
thing related to hiring; is that correct? 
I yield to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee. 
Mr. COHEN. Right. 
Mr. MCHENRY. I understand that 
correctly. Is there any reasonable limi-
tation—as an employer, is there any 
reasonable expectation for using a 
credit report in a hiring process, in 
your view? 
Mr. COHEN. I am still having trouble 
hearing. Like in the 8 years when I was 
in the minority, I couldn’t hear the 
majority party give me a chance to 
bring this to a vote. But I don’t think 
the answer is yes. The answer is no. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Reclaiming my time. 
If the amendment sponsor doesn’t wish 
to engage in debate, then don’t come to 
the House floor, Mr. Chair, unless you 
want to engage in a debate. I am offer-
ing a reasonable question. The gen-
tleman may be so far in left field he 
can’t hear me in this Chamber. 
But I would say this: As an employer, 
if you are handling cash, as an exam-
ple, every day, is it a reasonable thing 
to check somebody’s credit report to 
see if somebody has perhaps—I don’t 
know—had problems with cash, or is

massively in debt, or has not paid their 
bills. Is that a reasonable thing? 
Is it a reasonable thing if you get 
hired by the FBI to know that you 
have massive debt and, therefore, could 
fall victim to extortion? 
I think there is a reasonable limita-
tion. And what the gentleman has al-
ready exposed with his unwillingness 
to even engage in a simple colloquy— 
the gentleman has been around this 
House long enough to know this gen-
eral process, but he doesn’t want to an-
swer the question. 
The reason he doesn’t want to answer 
the question is he doesn’t believe any 
employer should be able to look at a 
consumer credit report for any hiring 
procedure, and I think that is patently 
absurd, Mr. Chair. 
So if employers have a real fear that 
hiring or retaining an individual can 
jeopardize the integrity of an institu-
tion, I think they should be able to 
check a credit report; just like in cer-
tain circumstances, somebody’s crimi-
nal background could be harmful. 
I will give you an example. Elder 
abuse. I think it is reasonable to know 
if somebody has committed a violent 
crime or has extorted money from peo-
ple. I think that is a reasonable cir-
cumstance, is it not? 
So I would say this: I offered a rea-
sonable opportunity for a debate on 
this. This is an absurd amendment that 
should be rejected. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, it can’t be 
the sole reason for denying a job, num-
ber one. That is what the bill says. And 
there are exemptions for circumstances 
when Federal, State, or local law call 
for it, or a national security clearance. 
Indeed, I think that if you are an ad-
ministrator, if you are over, say, the 
foreign policy of the United States and 
the Defense Department, people should 
know if you have great debts to, like, 
Russia or something. People should 
have a right to know that because it 
could relate to your employment. But 
that is another issue. 
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I 
rise to support the underlying bill by 
Representative PRESSLEY, and I thank 
her for her outstanding leadership. And 
I rise, in particular, to support the rea-
sonable, smart amendment of Mr. 
COHEN. It says very clearly that it is 
the sole reason. 
Let me be clear again, to my good 
friend. A credit score, or owing bills, is 
not criminal. It is not a criminal act. 
It doesn’t in any way diminish your 
ability to do your job. 
One percent of the American people 
own 90 percent of the wealth. That 
means that students with debt, and 
millennials, mostly, are not in that 
category. That means that you are not 
encouraging leadership if you use a 
credit score as the sole reason for deny-
ing an able leader that happens to be a 
millennial to get a job. I am outraged 
and insulted by the premise. 
Mr. COHEN’s amendment is a smart 
amendment that indicates, give these 
individuals a chance, as does the under-
lying bill by Ms. PRESSLEY. 
I rise enthusiastically to give relief 
to millennials and those with major 
student debt; one, under this act; and 
two, under Mr. COHEN’s amendment not 
to deny them a job. 
I support the Cohen amendment. I 
support the underlying bill by Ms. 
PRESSLEY, the Comprehensive CREDIT 
Act of 2020, and I believe we should 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on that amendment and 
‘‘yes’’ on the bill. Do our job for the 
millennials. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, is the gen-
tleman ready to close? Is the gen-
tleman ready to learn if a President 
has debts to Russia before he can count 
the money? 
Mr. MCHENRY. I will inquire of the 
Chair; how much time remains on both 
sides. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from North Carolina has 11⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ten-
nessee has 30 seconds remaining. 
Mr. MCHENRY. I have the right to 
close and I intend to do so. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, for the ex-
press purpose of this amendment, in 
legislative text it says that you cannot 
use a consumer credit report or the in-
formation therein to deny employ-
ment. And the gentleman in the very 
debate, Mr. Chair, said that he thinks 
some different standard. But that is 
not what this amendment does. 
This is a deeply-flawed amendment 
that has not been—I think it has been 
thought through, because the gen-
tleman wants to ban every potential 
limitation on employment, even in a 
sensitive industry, even dealing with 
the elderly, even dealing with children; 
and I think that is way too far to the 
left and out of the mainstream. 
And this amendment is not con-
forming with the rhetoric that he used 
on the floor. In fact, it is much more 
far-reaching. 
But it is also quite fitting with the 
overall bill, because the overall bill is 
about socializing credit; and if you so-
cialize credit, you can’t use any form 
or factor, and so I think this is really 
problematic. 
If employers have a real fear that 
hiring an individual can jeopardize the 
integrity of an institution, for in-
stance, a financial institution, or cause 
harm to the very people they are try-
ing to care for, or share sensitive infor-
mation on their customers, then they 
should have the opportunity to not 
hire those people that will cause harm 
or wreck our financial system. 
So this is a way-out-left amendment, 
and it is a way-out-left bill. 
So while I oppose it, I wish the gen-
tleman well. And I wish that we could 
actually engage in some reasonable de-
bate like I had with other Members. 
But I realize not all Members are the 
same. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 12 OFFERED BY MR. TAKANO 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 12 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–383. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 143, after line 8, insert the following: 
(c) PROHIBITION ON INCLUSION OF ARREST IN-
FORMATION IF THERE IS NO CONVICTION.—Sec-
tion 605(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
(15 U.S.C. 1681c(a)), as amended by section 
809, is further amended by adding at the end 
the following: 
‘‘(18) Records of an arrest, if the consumer 
was not convicted of any crime in connection 
with the arrest.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. TAKANO) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I rise to 
offer an amendment to the Comprehen-
sive CREDIT Act of 2020 that would 
prohibit the inclusion of arrest records 
on a consumer report if the arrest did 
not lead to a conviction. 
Consumer reporting in this country 
is extremely broken, and consumer re-
ports regularly have unexpected errors. 
Millions of public records do not con-
tain 
accurate 
information, 
which 
means that reports have been found to 
include 
outdated 
information 
and 
misclassified offenses. 
Additionally, incomplete reports fail 
to say whether or not a person who 
faced an arrest was exonerated or if 
criminal charges against them were 
dropped. 
An arrest does not prove criminal 
conduct and it is not a presumption of 
guilt. If a consumer was arrested and 
there was no subsequent conviction, 
that arrest should not be allowed to 
show on a consumer report. 
Now, due to the extreme bias in our 
criminal justice system, people of color 
are arrested and convicted at dis-
proportionate levels in this country. 
For example, we know that African 
Americans and Hispanics are approxi-
mately two to three times more likely 
to be arrested than their White coun-
terparts. 
b 1600 
These disproportionate levels of ar-
rests can negatively impact the ability 
for African Americans and Hispanics to 
obtain housing or find employment. 
That is why California, New York, and 
Kentucky have prohibited the inclu-
sion of arrest records without a convic-
tion on consumer reports. We need to

January 29, 2020 
follow their lead and implement this 
nationwide. 
I am encouraged by the work of my 
colleagues on the Financial Services 
Committee to limit the time adverse 
information can remain on a consumer 
credit report, including information 
pertaining to convictions. 
My amendment goes one step further 
by prohibiting arrest records from 
being included if they do not lead to a 
criminal conviction. Consumers de-
serve a fair shot in society and should 
not be penalized for wrongful arrests or 
arrests that did not lead to a guilty 
conviction. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to support my amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from North Carolina is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, this 
amendment would prohibit the inclu-
sion of any arrest records on a con-
sumer report if the arrest did not re-
sult in a conviction, but looking at the 
intention here, I would say to my col-
league, I see the intention here. 
In my view, this needs a little more 
work. And I say this to a Member who 
is not on the Financial Services Com-
mittee. So it is a very thoughtful 
amendment. I appreciate the gentle-
man’s approach. 
The difficulty here, and I am happy 
to yield, but the difficulty here is at 
what level? Is it multiple arrests that 
would be—I mean, I see this as the 
right intent. 
You don’t want somebody who makes 
a mistake, and their court date—be-
cause State courts are backed up, and 
you have a court date 6 months or a 
year in advance. You did something 
dumb. You are going to pay the price. 
You are a law-abiding citizen other-
wise, but you broke the law, and you 
are accused of something very serious. 
In that period of time, you can’t buy a 
house, potentially, you can’t buy a car. 
I see that as the intention. 
Now, you also have the circumstance 
where you have somebody who has a 
traumatic life event and has a serious 
break from their previous reality, and 
over a short period of time, over that 
same 6 months, let’s say, they have 
multiple arrests in increasing severity. 
We talk about the opioid crisis, but we 
have a larger societal crisis around 
mental illness and around abuse of il-
licit and otherwise heavily regulated 
drugs. So we have these periods of time 
that we have got to wrestle with in 
Federal law, but I see the gentleman’s 
intent. 
So, while I am opposed to this 
amendment because I think it is too 
broad because I think there are severe 
penalties for that period of time, I 
think it is probably right and just to 
have 
a 
pause, 
and 
if 
something 
changes, then they need to remove the 
fact that you are even accused of a 
crime. That shouldn’t be pertinent to 
somebody’s long-term credit. 
So that is how I see it. If I am off 
base in some way, I am happy to en-
gage on that. 
I yield to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia for a response. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I appre-
ciate the gentleman yielding. 
I want to point out to the gentleman 
that 
my 
amendment 
pertains 
to 
records of arrests that appear on con-
sumer reports that did not lead to a 
conviction, so, what is recorded on the 
report is an arrest. 
I don’t believe most Americans be-
lieve that it is fair for that consumer 
to suffer adverse ability to gain hous-
ing or to gain credit or whatever it 
may be, a job, but employers look at 
job—— 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, re-
claiming my time, on that subject mat-
ter, it is the period of time between the 
arrest and the court date is my con-
cern. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, is the 
gentleman concerned about the pend-
ing arrest? 
Mr. MCHENRY. Yes. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, we be-
lieve in those instances where there 
has been an arrest and there is a pend-
ing trial, so the arrest shows up on 
their record and there is a pending 
trial, we think it is a very small num-
ber of cases. 
I do agree with the gentleman from 
North Carolina that is something we 
should address, and I would be more 
than happy to work with him on final 
language if this should gain legs. I be-
lieve we can cure that particular in-
stance. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I 
would say I think the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) has offered a 
thoughtful amendment. We don’t want 
any unjust actions taken against some-
body because they are accused of some-
thing at one period of time or made a 
mistake and the courts found that that 
was not, in fact, something illegal. 
So I think he has the right intent. I 
think the gentleman’s inclination is 
right. I would be happy to work with 
him 
on 
a 
standalone 
measure 
to 
achieve something similar, but I appre-
ciate that. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I appreciate the spirit in which the 
gentleman from North Carolina under-
stands the intent here. I believe that 
most Americans seeing this language 
on its face would say it makes common 
sense. There is a kind of netherworld 
for that person who has been arrested 
but, yet, who has not been tried. 
I still say that our system of juris-
prudence says that the person who has 
been arrested and not yet tried is still 
presumed to be innocent, and I still 
maintain that it is reasonable for Con-
gress to hold a consumer reporting 
agency accountable to only reporting 
records of arrest for those who have 
been convicted. 
I understand there is some nether-
world here, but I still think we need to 
err on the side of our system of juris-
prudence, which says that we presume 
a person to be innocent until proven 
guilty, and a person who has been ar-
rested and not yet gone to trial is in 
that status. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, again, 
I still have concerns, but in the inter-
est of due process, the direction of this 
amendment I think is a thoughtful one, 
and the gentleman’s explanation is a 
strong explanation of his amendment. 
I would say in language such as no 
conviction, perhaps acquittal may be 
some better form of this, but this is 
something I am happy to work on if 
this ever gets to a conference com-
mittee, which I don’t believe the bill 
will. But I am happy to engage with 
my colleague from California on the 
contents of this, and, as a separate 
measure, potentially, to work with him 
on that. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I urge that my colleagues back this 
very commonsense amendment, which 
would ensure that any person who has 
been arrested but never convicted or 
whose case has never been brought to 
trial—actually, not been convicted. I 
want to make it very clear, if they 
have not been convicted, they should 
not be listed on a consumer credit re-
port. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. TAKANO). 
The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. BROWN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
I want to first recognize the hard 
work of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, under the leadership of Chair-
woman WATERS, and also the work and 
the commitment of Congresswoman 
PRESSLEY on the underlying bill. 
This legislative package reforms the 
credit reporting industry and improves 
consumer protections. 
Credit scores play a critical role in 
the lives and financial futures of Amer-
ican consumers. The information relied 
upon by the industry is personal to us, 
things like when we were born, where 
we live, and where we work. This data 
is some of the most valuable informa-
tion that we have in today’s digital 
economy. It often is how we prove our 
very identity, if not existence. It is key 
to every aspect of our lives, from ap-
plying to college, purchasing a car, ob-
taining housing, investing in our fu-
tures, and, eventually, to collecting re-
tirement. 
Credit agencies have not adequately 
secured this data and have violated our 
trust. The most egregious example of 
this is the Equifax breach of 2017. This 
theft was not a high-tech cyberattack. 
The weaknesses in the Equifax systems 
were known, as were the fixes, yet 
Equifax failed to take action. 
The 
credit 
agencies 
have 
dem-
onstrated that they are not able to se-
cure their systems by themselves. It is 
time for Congress to protect Americans 
from threats against their credit his-
tory and the misuse of their personal 
information. 
My amendment, Mr. Chairman, ad-
dresses this issue in two ways: 
First, it requires credit agencies to 
ensure they are meeting minimum 
training requirements for cybersecu-
rity. Every major corporation and 
most Federal, State, and local govern-
ment entities understand that cyberse-
curity training is crucial and have es-
tablished training requirements and 
standards. Credit agencies should do 
the same. 
Second, it gives the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau the authority 
to examine the cybersecurity protocols 
and training of credit agencies, to en-
sure these agencies are taking appro-
priate steps to secure our critical per-
sonal information. This oversight will 
ensure 
that 
credit 
agencies 
are 
proactively adapting to the change in 
threats more institutions face in cyber-
space. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to support this amendment and the un-
derlying legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
in 
opposition 
to 
this 
amendment, 
though I am not opposed to it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I am happy to see my friends on the 
other side of the aisle take the same 
interest that we have on this side of 
the aisle in protecting cybersecurity 
and protecting consumer data. I think 
it is great that this is a bipartisan con-
cern that we share. 
This amendment reaffirms the data 
security concerns that Republicans 
have highlighted in the past with re-
spect to credit reporting agencies, in-
cluding back in February of last year, 
the only time we had a hearing in the 
House Financial Services Committee 
on the credit reporting agencies. We 
want to ensure that these credit re-
porting agencies protect our data. 
The collection and maintenance of 
our personal information and exposing 
that to risk is deeply problematic. All 
we need to do is look back a few years 
ago to the Equifax breach to under-
stand how vital cybersecurity stand-
ards are, not only at the consumer 
credit reporting agencies, but across 
the financial sector. 
I appreciate the gentleman from 
Maryland using the language from my 
substitute amendment that I offered 
before the Rules Committee and before 
the House Financial Services Com-
mittee and incorporating it into this 
amendment. I am disappointed that the 
rest of the bill was not as bipartisan as 
this amendment text. 
Since this bill is not going anywhere, 
I would ask whether or not the author 
of the amendment would be interested 
in drafting a separate suspensionable— 
I think it has wide bipartisan support— 
a suspension-worthy version of this as 
a stand-alone bill. 
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing. 
I don’t share the gentleman from 
New Jersey’s pessimism this early in 
the game, so I will reserve judgment 
and a response for the appropriate 
time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, re-
claiming my time, I thank my new col-
league, but bipartisanship is kind of 
rare to happen around here, so when it 
is offered, let’s just go try to get it, try 
to work on it. That would be my sug-
gestion, Mr. Chairman. Since this is 
the language, verbatim, from my sub-
stitute, I am trying to be charitable. 
But with that, like I said, I am not 
opposed to the amendment. In fact, I 
am proud to really have written the 
contents of what is being offered. I am 
grateful that the gentleman offered it 
and the Rules Committee approved it, 
because they didn’t approve my stand- 
alone amendment in the nature of a 
substitute. 
Mr. Chairman, we are not going to 
resolve those broader issues, but I am 
happy to work with the gentleman if 
he is ever interested in a bipartisan bill 
on this measure. I am happy to do that. 
I am fine with the passage of this. I 
think the underlying bill is still deeply 
flawed. This doesn’t tip the balance for 
me to make an awful bill really good, 
but it does make an awful bill just 
slightly less awful. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 135, line 21, insert ‘‘, including home-
lessness (as defined by the Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development),’’ after 
‘‘barriers’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 811, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. PANETTA) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Chair, I thank 
Mr. LAWSON, Ms. PRESSLEY, and the 
ranking member for their work on this 
bill. 
I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 
3621, the Student Borrower Credit Im-
provement Act. 
As we all know, this bill that we are 
considering 
today 
strengthens 
con-
sumer protections for all Americans by 
making overdue reforms to credit re-
porting.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H696 
January 29, 2020 
Specifically, the Student Borrower 
Credit Improvement Act gives bor-
rowers facing economic hardship an op-
portunity to repair their credit profiles 
and prevent certain prior delinquencies 
from being reported. 
These borrowers, who are working to 
do 
everything 
right, 
deserve 
that 
chance to repair their credit scores. 
But at times, when a borrower experi-
ences sudden economic hardship, it can 
be nearly impossible to make pay-
ments on time. That is why the legisla-
tion in front of us allows borrowers to 
pause their repayments when they 
demonstrate undue hardship resulting 
from an unusual extenuating life cir-
cumstance. 
My amendment would include home-
lessness, as defined by HUD, as an ex-
tenuating 
life 
circumstance 
dem-
onstrating a hardship, therefore mak-
ing them eligible for that type of grace 
period that this legislation allows. 
When a borrower experiences home-
lessness, it is nearly impossible to 
focus on anything else, and securing a 
safe place to live becomes a top pri-
ority. 
This amendment would ensure that a 
borrower who is experiencing homeless-
ness can focus on finding a place to 
stay without worrying about missing a 
payment. 
A Federal Reserve study has shown 
that student loan debt has caused a 
third of borrowers to move in with 
their parents after school. But many 
students with debt lack that type of 
support system, and faced with a lack 
of housing options, they do become 
homeless. 
On the central coast of California, 
where I represent, there are some bor-
rowers who face homelessness even be-
fore graduating college. Students at 
the local university, the University of 
California at Santa Cruz, many of them 
have been forced to live in vehicles in 
the university’s parking lots. 
By including my amendment in this 
legislation, we can ensure that bor-
rowers experiencing homelessness are 
given a temporary reprieve and pre-
serve their ability to repair their cred-
it. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim 
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment, even though I am not opposed to 
it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, as we all 
know, homelessness is an issue that 
has plagued the lives of many Ameri-
cans across this country, and we know 
the particular crisis that is in Los An-
geles. 
I know that the gentleman is trying 
to deal with the particular issues of his 
home State, and so I commend him for 
that. But he is also highlighting some-
thing that has been a big debate—not 
debate, but a big point of discussion, I 
would say, and shared concern about 
homelessness that we have in the Fi-
nancial Services Committee. 
I know every committee of jurisdic-
tion has homelessness as a part of their 
agenda, but we are the committee that 
does housing, and we are trying to 
draw some consensus on how we deal 
with this homelessness crisis. 
We have a crisis of affordability 
across the country, but in particular, 
in high growth areas. It is a blessing 
that it is a high-growth area, but there 
is an enormous number of challenges 
that come along the way. 
It means that commutes get longer 
for people who are working-class folks. 
It means that you have folks who are 
making serious life decisions with a 
great limitation, right? So that im-
pairs, I think, economic growth. 
It is not just in New York or Los An-
geles or San Francisco where there is a 
homelessness crisis. I say this not 
using it as words of attack to the spon-
sor of this. It is not. We have a home-
lessness crisis in every community in 
America because we have homeless. We 
have a veterans homelessness crisis be-
cause if we have a single veteran who is 
homeless, that is not in keeping with 
who we are as America. 
So I think it is important to raise 
this issue of homelessness in every way 
we can. I think a number of the poli-
cies that have been offered this Con-
gress will make things worse, not bet-
ter. 
For the affordability challenge, I feel 
like national rent control policies and 
things of that sort will move us in the 
wrong direction for ensuring that we 
have enough housing stock for those 
who seek it. With the changing nature 
of how people want to live, we have to 
make sure that housing stock fits with 
that so you are able to grow housing 
stock to meet that need, not just for 
young people, but for old people and ev-
erybody in between, as I find out I am 
getting old, right? 
But with this, I appreciate my col-
league for offering this amendment. I 
think it is a thoughtful approach. It 
gives us the opportunity to have a 
wider discussion about homelessness 
and the challenges therein to those ex-
periencing it, to the communities that 
are struggling with it, and to all of us 
to come to terms with the best way to 
approach it. 
Look, this doesn’t tip the balance in 
my view of the underlying bill. For 
those of you who have been paying at-
tention to this debate, I won’t repeat 
myself on this, but this is the final 
amendment. 
I think the bill’s sponsor is of good-
will in trying to address this. The un-
derlying bill is still deeply problematic 
to me, but I commend my colleague for 
raising that. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Chair, I thank 
Mr. MCHENRY for his very thoughtful 
comments. 
Mr. Chair, I yield the remainder of 
my time to the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I find 
very often we tend to stereotype and 
present a very shallow narrative as to 
who experiences homelessness or is on 
the precipice of experiencing it. 
The reality is that struggle is cer-
tainly not a character flaw, and hard-
ship is transcendent. Many of us have 
disruptive life events: a layoff, a death, 
a natural disaster, displacement. I 
could go on. 
The point is that far too many Amer-
icans are living on the brink of finan-
cial collapse. So while this administra-
tion continues to undo basic protec-
tions for those experiencing homeless-
ness, we must be working to support 
them and help them to regain stability. 
There is no hierarchy of hurt. As 
someone who faced multiple eviction 
notices growing up, I can tell you that 
losing one’s home is every bit as trau-
matic as losing one’s job or being diag-
nosed with a life-threatening illness. 
We should be working to help people 
find housing, not punishing and crim-
inalizing those without it. 
This amendment would make it clear 
that Americans facing homelessness 
are able to get relief under our bill. I 
am proud to support it. 
Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague from 
California for offering this amendment. 
And in that this is the final amend-
ment, I want to thank Chairwoman 
WATERS for her leadership; the dedi-
cated Financial Services Committee 
staff; Representative LAWSON; and my 
dedicated A Team, specifically Aya 
Ibrahim, who has been the lead on this 
bill. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, again, for 
the overall bill, to put a bow on this, if 
you will, this bill is about socializing 
credit scores. If you socialize credit 
scores, you can socialize credit. If you 
can socialize credit, then you can have 
government make the decision about 
the allocation of credit in the private 
sector. 
This is a larger narrative from the 
far left in this country, which has now 
taken the opportunity to attempt to 
make legislative gains. 
The President has said he will not 
sign this bill, thankfully, which is good 
for the American consumer. Further-
more, I don’t see this seeing the light 
of day in the Senate. 
Having said that, we still need to 
have a serious bipartisan conversation 
about how to reform the credit report-
ing agencies and the law that underlies 
their regulatory framework. 
Mr. Chair, I am grateful for the op-
portunity to debate here on the House 
floor. While I am not opposed to this 
amendment, I remain opposed to the 
overall bill and will urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no’’ on that. But, again, I 
commend the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA) for his offering of 
a thoughtful amendment dealing with 
homelessness and raising this issue, 
not as a local issue, but as one of na-
tional import and one worthy of debate 
here on the House floor. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR 
The Acting CHAIR (during the vote). 
There is 1 minute remaining. 
b 1844 
Mr. STEUBE changed his vote from 
‘‘aye’’ to ‘‘no.’’ 
The amendment was agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. VEASEY). 
There being no further amendments, 
under the rule, the Committee rises. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. 
DEGETTE) having assumed the chair, 
Mr. VEASEY, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration 
the bill (H.R. 3621) to amend the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act to remove ad-
verse information for certain defaulted 
or delinquent private education loan 
borrowers who demonstrate a history 
of loan repayment, and for other pur-
poses, and, pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 811, he reported the bill, as amend-
ed by that resolution, back to the 
House with sundry further amend-
ments adopted in the Committee of the 
Whole. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered. 
Is a separate vote demanded on any 
further amendment reported from the 
Committee of the Whole? If not, the 
Chair will put them en gros. 
The amendments were agreed to. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have a motion to recommit 
at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. I am, in its 
present form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Hill of Arkansas moves to recommit 
the bill H.R. 3621 to the Committee on Fi-
nancial Services with instructions to report

lated to political opinions, religious expres-
sion, or other expression protected by the 
First Amendment, whether obtained from a 
social media account of a consumer or other 
sources.’’; and 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas (during the 
reading). Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent to dispense with the 
reading. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arkansas? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
kansas is recognized for 5 minutes in 
support of his motion. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, let me start by saying the 
spirit of this bill is noble. Finding ways 
to ensure that all Americans, no mat-
ter of race, creed, color, or ZIP Code, 
have access to affordable credit is a 
noble pursuit. It is a top priority of the 
House Financial Services Committee. 
In fact, Madam Speaker, it is a per-
sonal priority. I have introduced H.R. 
4231 that has bipartisan and bicameral 
support. It facilitates the use of addi-
tional data from rental, utility, and 
telecom payments to help more Ameri-
cans repair and build their credit score. 
Thousands more would qualify and 
have better access to credit. 
The reality is that, while this is an 
issue that faces all Americans, it is 
communities of color that overwhelm-
ingly face the greatest obstacles when 
it comes to obtaining access to afford-
able credit. 
Legislating is difficult. It requires 
good faith negotiation, compromise, 
and a willingness to take a small de-
gree of political risk that occasionally 
makes our political lives a little more 
complicated. 
Messaging, Madam Speaker, on the 
other hand, is easy. It only requires the 
inherent power of the majority. 
There was a bipartisan path that 
could have been taken, but today, 
House Democrats chose to detour down 
the messaging-only path. 
With a vote today, the majority is, 
sadly, seeking to socialize credit, con-
sumer credit ratings, and credit risk. 
This will jeopardize access to credit for 
millions of low-income and moderate- 
income families. 
This legislation will inhibit lenders’ 
ability to get the full picture of a con-
sumer’s financial health, making risk 
more difficult to assess. This ulti-
mately increases the cost and de-
creases the availability for our con-
sumers. 
The good news is, Madam Speaker, 
that Republicans will stand united in 
opposition to a government takeover of 
our credit bureaus. 
Today, the majority in Congress 
seeks to socialize our credit system by 
having credit scoring and credit scor-
ing models taken over by the govern-
ment, specifically, the unaccountable 
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau. However, I hope that we can all 
come together on one major principle. 
My amendment will not kill the bill 
or send it back to committee. It will 
ensure that we do not allow Federal 
agencies to pick winners and losers 
based on political, religious, or other 
beliefs protected by our Constitution. 
Specifically, my friends, we need to 
ensure that the CFPB does not exploit 
this newfound power and punish Ameri-
cans based on their heartfelt First 
Amendment rights. Simply put, my 
motion to recommit will prohibit the 
CFPB from requiring credit scoring 
models from using information related 
to Americans’ political opinions, their 
religious beliefs, or other expression 
that is protected by the First Amend-
ment. 
Let’s make certain, my friends, that 
the United States Government doesn’t 
use the tactics now made so popular in 
Beijing. 
In China, Madam Speaker, agencies 
are collecting enormous amounts of 
data related to individual financing, 
social media accounts, health records, 
and facial recognition. In China, my 
friends, now we have the social score. 
It permits rewards and punishments 
based on each individual’s social score. 
For example, if you have a higher so-
cial score, you might get a discount on 
your monthly energy bill. If you have a 
lower score, you might not be able to 
get on that train or airplane. 
According to the Chinese Govern-
ment, all social scores for 1.4 billion 
Chinese will be made publicly available 
this year. 
American ideals go against every-
thing the social credit system rep-
resents. Supporting this MTR would 
ensure what is happening in China will 
never happen in our country. 
The CFPB has too much power, and 
we should make sure that Americans 
do not lose access to credit based on 
the decisions of an unaccountable orga-
nization. This unaccountable organiza-
tion has a history of overstepping its 
bounds. 
As policymakers, we need to support 
measures that increase access to af-
fordable credit and increase accuracy 
and security of the consumer credit in-
formation while remedying concerns 
about the existing system. 
This legislation undermines the fun-
damental strengths of that credit re-
porting system and makes it more dif-
ficult, more expensive, for lenders to 
analyze the credit risk of our friends 
and neighbors across this country. 
The United States has the best finan-
cial system in the world. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this motion to 
recommit; vote ‘‘no’’ on the underlying 
bill. Help maintain the United States 
as the most competitive consumer fi-
nance system in the world. And I would 
urge my friends, there is a right way to 
vote on this MTR and there is a Huawei 
to vote on this MTR. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to claim the time in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, the 
current credit reporting system is bro-
ken and does not work for consumers, 
nor does this motion to recommit. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to take a 
few moments to address what my col-
league just said, to address his jangling 
discords of words. 
Today, they are trying to slow down 
this bill. We have had four hearings, 
two markups in this Congress alone. 
Never once did this come up. And now 
they want to make it about false fears? 
Now they want to make it about free 
speech and China? 
Let me tell you something: We don’t 
have free speech when credit bureaus 
own our information and it is wrong. 
Madam Speaker, the current credit 
reporting system is rigged in favor of 
the credit reporting agencies, plain and 
simple. They have all the power. They 
are accountable to no one. Ordinary 
American consumers are not their cus-
tomers but their products. 
In 2017, Madam Speaker, one of the 
three 
credit 
reporting 
bureaus, 
Equifax, exposed personal information 
of more than 148 million Americans— 
nearly half the country—in the largest 
data breach ever, and there was noth-
ing that our constituents could have 
done about it to protect or stop their 
sensitive personal information from 
being exposed. 
Even the ranking member of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee admits 
that the system is broken. But what 
was the response of my Republican ma-
jority colleagues in 2017 when the 
American people found out that their 
data was breached? 
Did they bring any legislation to the 
floor to address it? Did they bring any-
thing to fix it? No. 
Instead, they tried to repeal protec-
tions for people with preexisting condi-
tions in affordable healthcare. Instead, 
they passed massive tax cuts for the 1 
percent. 
Well, there is a new Democratic ma-
jority in this Congress, and we are act-
ing to fix this broken system with the 
Comprehensive CREDIT Act. 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
MAXINE 
WATERS. 
There are few numbers as important 
to an individual as their credit score. 
Whether you are applying for a home 
loan, an auto loan, a credit card, or 
even applying for a job, a credit score 
plays a crucial role in the financial 
lives of all Americans. 
Despite its importance, the system is 
broken. The FTC found that 42 million 
consumers had errors found in their 
credit reports, and the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau’s complaint 
database shows that the number one 
topic by consumers, 39 percent of all 
complaints, was consumers reporting 
errors. 
Do the credit reporting companies 
care? No, they do not. Why should 
they? There is no incentive for them to 
care, because the consumers have no 
say. 
This package of bills would fun-
damentally overhaul the broken sys-
tem and give the power over credit files

back to the consumers where it be-
longs. This package of bills is For the 
People. 
Madam Speaker, I stand with Con-
gresswoman AYANNA PRESSLEY and her 
bill to remove predatory private edu-
cation loan information from credit 
files. 
I stand with Congresswoman TLAIB 
and her bill to prohibit medical debt to 
be reported to credit bureaus for 1 
year. 
I stand with Congressman LYNCH and 
his bill to give regulators oversight 
over credit scoring models. 
I stand with Congressman LAWSON 
and his bill to ensure employers don’t 
use credit files to discriminate in hir-
ing decisions. 
I stand with Congresswoman ADAMS 
and her bill to put the power to dispute 
credit inaccuracies back into the hands 
of consumers. 
And I stand for my bill to give con-
sumers free access to their credit 
scores directly from the three national 
credit reporting agencies, with no 
strings attached. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to stand with us, stand with 
the consumers. Support us and your 
constituents. Vote ‘‘yes’’ for this bill 
and ‘‘no’’ on the MTR. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.

f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF LINDA COZZEN 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise to commemorate and dedicate 
this time to one of our local activists 
in Tarrant County, Linda Cozzen, who 
was a great friend of mine. 
Linda was born in Canada and be-
came a U.S. citizen at the age of 8 
when her grandparents immigrated to 
the United States. 
Linda and her brother were orphans, 
and their entry into the country in 
Texas would not have been possible 
were it not for the great work of the 
President and Senator from Texas, 
Lyndon Johnson, who was one of her 
heroes. President Johnson had a huge 
impact on Linda’s life, which is one of 
the reasons why she was so active in 
politics in Fort Worth and Tarrant 
County. 
Over the years, she served on a lot of 
different committees: The 820 Corridor 
Democratic Club, the Southwest Demo-
cratic Club, Tarrant County Demo-
cratic Party, Tarrant County Demo-
cratic Club, League of Women Voters. 
She was a precinct chair, and so many 
others for over 20 years. 
She also served as campaign manager 
for numerous candidates in local and 
State elections. And she was a proud 
alumna of Texas Christian University 
also in Fort Worth, TCU. 
Ms. Cozzen’s story highlights the im-
portance of incorporating immigrants 
into our democracy and providing them 
with an opportunity to participate in 
our political system. 
Linda was a great friend, and some-
one who always just had encouraging 
words for me and so many others. She 
was at literally every single Demo-
cratic event in Tarrant County. 
It has really been a sad week when 
everybody found out about her un-
timely passing, and our blessings go 
out to her family and all of her friends 
who will miss her. 
COMMEMORATING 250TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BOTETOURT COUNTY, 
VIRGINIA 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 250th anniver-
sary of Botetourt County, Virginia. 
When 
initially 
founded, 
Botetourt 
County extended far and wide, all the 
way to the banks of the Mississippi 
River, and encompassed portions of 
seven present-day States. 
Named for Royal Governor Norborne 
Berkeley, Lord Botetourt, this scenic 
county serves as a gateway from the 
Shenandoah Valley into southwest Vir-
ginia. 
As you walk through the quaint 
towns within the county’s borders, you 
are filled with a sense of awe, not only 
because of its beauty, but because of 
the history that surrounds you. 
Thomas Jefferson famously designed 
an earlier version of the county court-
house in the town of Fincastle, and 
Lewis and Clark departed on their 
great expedition westward from within 
Botetourt County. 
Even after exploring the vast western 
expanse of America, William Clark re-
turned to marry county resident, Ju-
dith Hancock, following his journey. 
Just 
as 
the 
James 
River 
flows 
through Botetourt County, our citizens 
will continue to carve out their path 
toward prosperity with excitement and 
hope in the centuries to come. 
Madam Speaker, may God continue 
to bless Botetourt County. 
f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
MADISON ELIZABETH WEGENER 
(Ms. SLOTKIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Madison 
Elizabeth Wegener of Brighton, Michi-
gan, who was 14 when she passed away 
last Tuesday. 
When she was six, Maddie was diag-
nosed with a rare degenerative disease 
that currently has no cure. 
From all accounts, Maddie was a vi-
vacious 
and 
adventurous 
young 
woman. She loved Great Danes, taking 
walks in the woods, and making maple 
syrup at her grandparents’ farm. 
Because of her illness, Maddie be-
came an advocate for organ donation 
at a young age. In her selflessness, 
upon her death, Maddie was able to 
save four lives, and also provide the 
gift of sight through her organ dona-
tions. Think about that. 
Maddie’s generosity of spirit sets a 
powerful example, as her legacy will 
live on in her family, in her commu-
nity, and in those that she helped save. 
Maddie was just a freshman at Brigh-
ton High School, where her mother 
teaches English. 
I had the privilege to attend the 
Brighton-Howell basketball game 10

days ago. The students were asked to 
come onto the court during half time 
to make a donation and take a free 
throw for Maddie. Students from both 
schools, 
from 
every 
social 
circle, 
walked onto that court to support her 
family. 
I know that the Brighton community 
has rallied around her family and 
today is mourning her loss. Our hearts 
are with her family as we honor and 
celebrate the life of this remarkable 
young woman.

RECOGNIZING ELENI 
CHRISTOPOULOS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Knoxville Catholic 
High 
School 
senior 
Eleni 
Christopoulos. Eleni has earned the 
Girl Scout Gold Award and was re-
cently named to Knox.biz’s 20 Under 20 
class. 
When Eleni was born, she had a seri-
ous infection that needed specialized 
medical care. Fortunately, she over-
came her illness, but she knows that 
not every sick child will get the same 
outcome. The experience inspired Eleni 
to start a program at East Tennessee 
Children’s Hospital to comfort families 
whose children pass away in the neo-
natal intensive care unit. 
Eleni builds and hand-paints memory 
boxes for grieving families to store 
cherished keepsakes like photos and 
footprints. While it is impossible to 
ease the pain of a lost child, Eleni’s 
memory boxes offer the families a 
small comfort during a difficult time. 
We don’t hear enough about our 
young folks giving back to their com-
munities and taking the initiative to 
help others, so I congratulate Eleni for 
making a meaningful difference in the 
Knoxville community and for being 
recognized as a young leader in the 20 
Under 20 class. 
Eleni has a bright future ahead of 
her, Mr. Speaker, and I know her 
grandparents and her mom and dad, 
and they are very proud, as I am.

ON WINNING A GRAMMY AWARD 
(Mr. CUNNINGHAM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, 
I am proud to rise today to congratu-
late Charleston’s very own Ranky 
Tanky for winning a Grammy for Best 
Regional Roots Music Album. 
Ranky Tanky was formed in 2016, 
made their Lowcountry debut in April 
2017, and have since issued two albums 
and toured the world. Despite touring 
the world and going around the U.S. 
and playing, they have never forgotten 
their hometown of Charleston and 
their Lowcountry roots. 
The Gullah culture is a vital part of 
the Lowcountry and our history. It is 
in the food we eat and the music we 
love. Ranky Tanky has shared Gullah 
tradition with the entire world, and for 
that, we owe them a debt of gratitude. 
Congrats to Quentin, Kevin, Quiana, 
Clay, and Charlton. I am sure that this 
journey feels like it has been a fairy-
tale, but I assure them that they are 
just getting started.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BRIAN 
KELLY 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the life of my friend Brian Kelly, who 
passed away on Tuesday, January 21, at 
1:21 a.m., after a long and courageous 
battle with brain cancer. 
I first met Brian when we were con-
gressional staffers together in central 
Illinois. He was infectious to be around 
with his positive attitude and his per-
petual optimism to always help others. 
We bonded over our mutual friends and 
experiences 
in 
his 
hometown 
of 
Vandalia, Illinois. 
Brian was the epitome of what a pub-
lic servant should strive to be, putting 
everyone else above himself, even dur-
ing his fight against this deadly dis-
ease. After diagnosis, when I would see 
him, the smile and accompanying 
laughs made us sometimes forget the 
pain that he and his wife, Megan, were 
experiencing when none of us were 
around. 
Madam Speaker, my friend Brian has 
no more need to fight, but knowing 
that does not make it any easier on his 
loved ones who lost him too soon. My 
heartfelt prayers go out to his lovely 
wife, Megan, and the entire Kelly fam-
ily and all those who were lucky, like 
me, to know such a kind soul.

RECOGNIZING RUSSELL 
‘‘ROOSTER’’ VALENTI 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize 
an 
extraordinary 
con-
stituent, a man who, in my commu-
nity, is known only as Rooster. He 
really needs no other name, but his 
given name is Russell Valentini. 
Rooster has worked in the Allentown 
School District for a very long time. 
His title with the Allentown School 
District is Home and School Visitor, 
but it fails to capture the world of dif-
ference he has made in the lives of 
homeless children and families. 
For 35 years, Rooster has served as 
the lifeline for the 600 to 800 students 
experiencing homelessness in the Al-
lentown School District at any given 
time. The poems he has written over 
the years about the children he has en-
countered reflect the ways that the 
children have touched his life and in 
which he has touched theirs. 
Even now, Rooster still grows emo-
tional when telling the story of the fa-
ther who doesn’t know if he will be 
able to get his paycheck in time to 
make the rent, the family who has lost 
their home, the child with no bed to 
sleep in at night. 
Rooster, for these many years, has 
provided school supplies, uniforms, and 
hygiene items, as well as food, to help 
these students and their families. 
Everywhere in my community there 
are people whose lives are immeas-
urably better today because of Rooster. 
Rooster prepares to retire at the end 
of this school year, and I want to con-
gratulate him. We will miss him. We 
should all draw inspiration from the 
powerful example he has set. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DEMARKUS 
BOWMAN, MR. FOOTBALL 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Lakeland High 
School’s Demarkus Bowman, who was 
recently named Florida’s Mr. Football. 
After finishing runner-up last year, 
Demarkus beat out the competition 
this year, having run for over 1,600 
yards and 24 touchdowns in only 11 
games. As a unanimous 5-star running 
back and the number 16 overall player 
in the Nation, Demarkus will be taking 
his talent next season to Clemson Uni-
versity. 
Not only is Demarkus a star football 
player, but Demarkus also excels in 
track. More importantly, Demarkus is 
a young man with a grateful heart who 
is supported by a devoted family and 
friends. 
I am proud of Demarkus and all his 
Dreadnaught teammates who represent 
our district so well. Not only do I cele-
brate their accomplishments on the 
field, but I also look forward to seeing 
them take on the mantle of leadership 
in their generation.

RECOGNIZING JAMES GREGORIUS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
James Gregorius, the associate direc-
tor for training at the Federal Law En-
forcement Training Center, FLETC, 
who will be retiring this week after 
more than 40 years of public service. 
Mr. Gregorius began his career in law 
enforcement as a police officer with 
the Montgomery County, Maryland, 
Police Department. From there, he 
transitioned to Federal policing, where 
he served as a special agent within 
both the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration as well as the National Secu-
rity Agency.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H704 
January 29, 2020 
This experience and this expertise po-
sitioned him perfectly for a high-level 
career with the Federal Law Enforce-
ment 
Training 
Center, 
which 
is 
headquartered in the First Congres-
sional District of Georgia. During 
James’ time there, he did an excep-
tional job of managing training oper-
ations in Georgia, New Mexico, South 
Carolina, and the D.C. metropolitan 
area. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Mr. 
Gregorius for his service to our coun-
try and congratulate him on his retire-
ment. 
James’ presence, leadership, and ex-
pertise will all be missed.

RECOGNIZING THE HEROIC ACTION 
OF ODREN POLK 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
KELLER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, it is my great pleasure to recog-
nize the heroic action of Odren Polk, a 
resident 
of 
Williamsport, 
Pennsyl-
vania, in our 12th Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Affectionately referred to as ‘‘Mr. 
O,’’ Odren serves his community at 
Stevens Primary School through STEP 
AmeriCorps, a national service organi-
zation. 
On what Odren described as an other-
wise usual day in the cafeteria, Mr. O 
noticed one of the students choking on 
a grape tomato. Utilizing the first aid 
training he received at AmeriCorps, 
Mr. O jumped into action, dislodging 
the tomato from the student’s airway 
and saving his life. 
What Mr. O described as an auto-
matic reaction was possible only be-
cause of the training he received at 
AmeriCorps. 
AmeriCorps is a network of national 
service programs that seeks to improve 
lives and foster civic engagement. Ap-
proximately 75,000 Americans across 
the country serve their community 
through AmeriCorps each year. 
AmeriCorps members also receive 
training that prepares them to serve 
their 
communities 
after 
their 
AmeriCorps is completed. As in the 
case with Mr. O, sometimes that train-
ing comes in handy sooner rather than 
later.

PROVIDING 
NEW 
EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL AMER-
ICANS 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, today, 
President Trump signed the historic 
United 
States-Mexico-Canada 
trade 
agreement and fulfilled a campaign 
promise to modernize trade with two of 
our largest trading partners. 
The USMCA is projected to generate 
$68 billion in new economic activity 
and create over 175,000 new jobs for 
hardworking Americans. 
President Trump and Republicans 
fought to complete the USMCA on be-
half of American farmers, ranchers, 
manufacturers, 
and 
small 
business 
owners. 
As a rural State with strong agricul-
tural, manufacturing, and business sec-
tors, Mississippi stands to benefit 
greatly from this agreement by ex-
panding markets for high-quality Mis-
sissippi poultry and livestock and hun-
dreds of manufacturing products. 
This trade agreement will provide a 
boost to our economy that has grown 
significantly under Republican leader-
ship and is another example of free 
market economic principles at work to 
provide new employment opportunities 
for all Americans.

WISHING THE KANSAS CITY 
CHIEFS LUCK IN THE SUPER BOWL 
(Mr. MARSHALL asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, it 
seems like it was just yesterday when 
I sat down in my family living room 
with my dad to watch Super Bowl IV. 
It was an exciting game, watching 
Hank Stram strut up and down the 
sideline, Lenny Dawson completing 
long passes to Otis Taylor. 
This weekend, after 50 years in the 
desert, the Chiefs are back at the Super 
Bowl. On behalf of the entire delega-
tion, I want to wish Coach Reid and 
MVP Patrick Mahomes a great day, a 
great game, wishing that they all do 
their very best and bring back home 
that Lombardi Trophy.

HONORING JEAN FERNANDEZ 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, this 
past weekend was the 75th anniversary 
of the Battle of the Bulge of World War 
II in Europe. 
I rise today to honor a great lady, 
Jean Fernandez, who is a veteran of 
that historic battle and turned 100 very 
recently. 
Living to be 100 years old is an ac-
complishment on its own, but Jean’s 
story is particularly remarkable. 
Arriving after D-Day and before the 
Battle of the Bulge, Jean is one of the 
few women veterans who was actually 
able to serve in that role in our Nation 
during World War II. 
During her time as a nurse at the 
179th U.S. Army General Hospital at 
Rouen in northern France, the hospital 
was constantly under threat of air at-
tack, and many of the young men she 
cared for were severely affected by 
shell shock. 
Had it not been for the My Life, My 
Story program provided by the VA, 
Jean’s story may not have ever been 
told. 
I had the pleasure of stopping by and 
spending some time with her at her 
100th birthday party up in Susanville, 
and I enjoyed hearing her recount her 
time in the military as well as her ex-
traordinary life. 
What a neat lady. She is an excep-
tional American, and I am very thank-
ful for her service and really honored 
to have had a chance to get to know 
her and spend time with her.

REVIEWING IMPEACHMENT 
PROCESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SLOTKIN). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, it 
has been an interesting day. 
I was down in the Senate earlier 
today. We have reciprocity with the 
Senate, so we can go onto the Senate 
floor. It is a very interesting experi-
ence, seeing a President who com-
mitted no crime, not even perjury, like 
President Clinton, having an attempt 
to remove him from office. 
An article today by Brent Bozell 
says: ‘‘One favorite tactic of our ‘objec-
tive’ media during the impeachment of 
President Donald Trump is to find a 
clip of the President’s legal experts 
such as Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz 
expressing an opinion during the 1998– 
99 impeachment of Bill Clinton and 
then show a contrast with the present 
day. But this is just as easily dem-
onstrated with the press. 
‘‘It is not surprising that Democrats 
and Republicans favor or oppose im-
peachment based on the party of the 
President in the dock. It should be sur-
prising 
that 
our 
supposedly 
non-
partisan journalists flip to whichever 
talking points are in use by the Demo-
crats. That makes the press a gaggle of 
hypocrites. 
‘‘Back in 1998, Newsweek’s Eleanor 
Clift spoke for the vast majority of the 
press 
from 
her 
chair 
on 
‘The 
McLaughlin Group.’ Before the House 
voted to impeach Clinton, she warned, 
‘If the Republicans want to go ahead 
and do this, I think they disgrace 
themselves in a more profound way 
than President Clinton has by abusing 
the machinery of impeachment, know-
ing full well that the Senate will hold 
a sham trial and they will be, in effect, 
delivered of this ridiculous conclusion.’ 
‘‘Over and over again, these network 
‘news’ stars lamented that the House 
impeachment vote and the Senate im-
peachment trial of President Clinton 
were a ‘sham’ and a horrible ‘distrac-
tion’ from the people’s business. They 
said small-minded Republican Clinton 
haters were obsessed with sex, and 
never mind the actual charges of per-
jury and obstruction of justice.’’ 
Obstruction of justice, of course, 
being a crime and perjury being a 
crime, whereas obstruction of Congress 
is more in the nature of maladmin-
istration, which the Founders made

H705 
January 29, 2020 
clear should not be a basis for impeach-
ment. 
‘‘Then there was NBC’s Matt Lauer, 
who brought on former House Speaker 
Jim Wright, who resigned in disgrace 
in 1989 over a corrupt scheme of selling 
crates 
of 
his 
books 
to 
lobbying 
groups.’’ 
As I recall, there were restrictions on 
getting paid for speeches, so groups 
would buy thousands of his books that 
would sit in crates and go nowhere, in 
many cases, from what was said back 
then, as a way of getting around that. 
But he spoke with moral authority in 
response to Lauer. 
‘‘Lauer said: ‘Speaker Wright, let me 
start with you. When you resigned 9 
years ago, you had been battered by 
the right. You called for an end to 
what 
you 
called 
‘mindless 
canni-
balism.’ Nine years later, we are hear-
ing terms like that again and others 
swirling around the impeachment of 
Bill Clinton. Have we learned nothing 
in 9 years?’ ’’ 
As the article says, one thing we all 
do know is Matt Lauer learned abso-
lutely nothing from Bill Clinton about 
sexual harassment in the workplace. 
Rather interesting. 
There was an article a week ago from 
Paul Sperry. 
Like I say, I was down at the Senate 
earlier today, and I know the Presi-
dent’s lawyers were asking people and 
their staff, Republicans, not to use the 
name people have referred to as being 
the whistleblower. 
I have never named the whistle-
blower. I have named people who I be-
lieved were critical fact witnesses, and 
some in the media lambasted me and 
said: You named the whistleblower. 
Well, I thought we didn’t know who 
the whistleblower was. How do you 
know who the whistleblower was when 
I named him if we don’t know who the 
whistleblower is, if you don’t know 
who the whistleblower is? 
Anyway, hypocrisy knows no bounds 
when it comes to some in the Wash-
ington media and some here in Con-
gress. But in any event, the request is 
not to mention the name of the person, 
the leftwing activist who has been un-
dermining and trying to destroy the 
Trump 
Presidency 
since 
President 
Trump got elected, commonly referred 
to as the whistleblower. 
But the article by Paul Sperry says: 
‘‘Sources told RealClearInvestigations 
the staffer with whom’’ this leftwing 
activist trying to destroy the Trump 
Presidency, also called the whistle-
blower, ‘‘was speaking was Sean Misko. 
Both were Obama administration hold-
overs working in the Trump White 
House on foreign policy and national 
security issues. And both expressed 
anger over Trump’s new ‘America 
First’ foreign policy, a sea change from 
President Obama’s approach to inter-
national affairs. 
‘‘ ‘Just days after he was sworn in, 
they were already talking about trying 
to get rid of him,’ said a White House 
colleague who overheard their con-
versation. ‘They weren’t just bent on 
subverting his agenda,’ the former offi-
cial added. ‘They were plotting to actu-
ally have him removed from office.’ ’’ 
Sean Misko ‘‘left the White House 
last summer to join House impeach-
ment manager ADAM
SCHIFF’s com-
mittee, where sources say he offered 
‘guidance’ to the whistleblower, who 
has been officially identified only as an 
intelligence officer in a complaint 
against Trump filed under whistle-
blower laws. Misko then helped run the 
impeachment inquiry based on that 
complaint as a top investigator for 
congressional Democrats.’’ 
That is in the Democrats’ part of the 
Intelligence Committee. 
The probe culminated in Trump’s im-
peachment last month, and ‘‘Schiff and 
other House Democrats last week de-
livered the Articles of Impeachment to 
the Senate and are now pressing the 
case for his removal during the trial, 
which began last Tuesday’’ of last 
week. 
‘‘The coordination between the offi-
cial believed to be the whistleblower 
and a key Democratic staffer, details 
of which are disclosed here for the first 
time, undercuts the narrative that im-
peachment 
developed 
spontaneously 
out of what Trump’s Democratic an-
tagonists call the ‘patriotism’ of an 
‘apolitical civil servant.’ 
‘‘Two former coworkers said they 
overheard’’ the leftwing activist trying 
to destroy Trump, sometimes called 
the whistleblower, ‘‘and Misko, close 
friends and Democrats, discussing how 
to ‘take out,’ or remove, the new Presi-
dent 
from 
office 
within 
days 
of 
Trump’s inauguration. These cowork-
ers said the President’s controversial 
Ukraine phone call in July 2019 pro-
vided the pretext they and their Demo-
cratic allies had been looking for. 
‘‘ ‘They didn’t like his policies,’ an-
other former White House official said. 
‘They had a political vendetta against 
him from day one.’ 
‘‘Their efforts were part of a larger 
pattern of coordination to build a case 
for 
impeachment, 
involving 
Demo-
cratic leaders as well as anti-Trump 
figures both inside and outside of gov-
ernment. 
‘‘All unnamed sources for this article 
spoke only on condition that they not 
be further identified or described. Al-
though strong evidence points to’’ the 
leftwing activist trying to destroy 
President Trump, also known as the 
whistleblower, ‘‘as the government em-
ployee who lodged the whistleblower 
complaint, he has not been officially 
identified as such. As a result, this ar-
ticle makes a distinction between pub-
lic information released about the 
unnamed 
whistleblower/CIA 
analyst 
and specific information about’’ the 
leftwing activist trying to destroy 
President Trump, also known as the 
whistleblower. 
‘‘Democrats based their impeach-
ment case on the whistleblower com-
plaint, which alleges that President 
Trump sought to help his reelection 
campaign by demanding that Ukraine’s 
leader investigate former Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden and his son Hunter in 
exchange for military aid.’’ 
The article goes on: ‘‘The whistle-
blower’s candor is also being called 
into question. It turns out that the CIA 
operative failed to report his contacts 
with Schiff’s office to the intelligence 
community’s inspector general who 
fielded this whistleblower complaint. 
He withheld the information both in 
interviews with the inspector general, 
Michael Atkinson, and in writing, ac-
cording to impeachment committee in-
vestigators. The whistleblower form he 
filled out required him to disclose 
whether he had ‘contacted other enti-
ties’—including ‘Members of Congress.’ 
But he left that section blank on the 
disclosure form he signed. 
‘‘The investigators say that details 
about how the whistleblower consulted 
with Schiff’s staff and perhaps misled 
Atkinson about those interactions are 
contained in the transcript of a closed- 
door briefing Atkinson gave to the 
House Intelligence Committee last Oc-
tober. However, Schiff has sealed the 
transcript from public view. It is the 
only impeachment witness transcript 
out of 18 that he has not released.’’ 
I think I will pause here at this 
point. I have continually heard down in 
the Senate the House managers refer-
ring to what is basically a travesty to 
have a trial without any witnesses. No. 
Here is the real travesty. 
The real travesty was the violation 
of House rules, not allowing Repub-
licans to have the witnesses we re-
quested. When those weren’t agreed to, 
then under the rules—and, of course, 
the Democrats are in the majority. 
They could have changed the rules. 
They didn’t, so we were entitled to a 
minority day of witnesses to testify, 
and that was refused as well. 
That was the real travesty, when 
there was no allowance for Republicans 
to get down to real facts, get down to 
the bottom of the allegations against 
the President. That was truly a trav-
esty. 
But in the committee of jurisdiction, 
the Judiciary Committee, we were only 
allowed to have some law school pro-
fessors come in and give us their opin-
ions. Two were quite clearly hateful of 
President Trump. One tried to sound as 
if he was reluctant to talk about im-
peachment when he had been busy 
twittering about impeachment since 
President Trump had first been elected 
and sworn in. 
It was a very disingenuous hearing, 
but we had to sit there and listen to 
the pontificating from people who 
clearly adjusted their opinions to ad-
dress 
their 
disdain 
for 
President 
Trump. But that was the only live wit-
nesses we were allowed to have. 
Instead, we took in all these deposi-
tions, all the transcribed depositions. 
That is what we took in. Those were 
our witnesses. That is what the House 
Judiciary Committee and this House 
Chamber was supposed to have consid-
ered in voting on impeachment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H706 
January 29, 2020 
We were told, no, we have all this 
testimony, lots of witnesses, before the 
Judiciary Committee vote. We have all 
these transcripts if you want to read 
them. 
b 2000 
We had all of these transcripts, lots 
of witnesses. You want to read them. 
And then people had the gall to go 
down the hall to the Senate and say: 
They are not allowing any witnesses. 
Well, either there were no witnesses 
that the Judiciary Committee was able 
to consider, other than professors—and 
I thought Professor Turley was out-
standing. He and Alan Dershowitz are 
normally quite liberal, but they care 
deeply about civil rights, and they care 
deeply about the Constitution, and 
they don’t let their political persua-
sions affect what they believe about 
the Constitution. I admire that in 
them, even though, like I say, we have 
some strong disagreements on other 
things. 
But there in the Senate, down the 
hall, they have all that mass of, what 
we were told here, was overwhelming 
evidence. They have got all of those 
transcripts down there. It is part of the 
evidence in the Senate, part of it, so ei-
ther there was no evidence, no wit-
nesses in the House, or there is plenty 
of evidence from which the Senate can 
consider and vote down this travesty 
called an effort to remove President 
Trump. 
In this article it says: ‘‘The inves-
tigators say that details about how the 
whistleblower consulted with Schiff’s 
staff and perhaps misled Atkinson 
about those interactions are contained 
in the transcript,’’ as I mentioned. 
‘‘Schiff has classified the document 
‘secret,’ preventing Republicans who 
attended the Atkinson briefing from 
quoting from it. Even impeachment in-
vestigators cannot view it outside a 
highly secured room.’’ 
Anyway, it goes on. It is pretty ridic-
ulous. The article says further on: ‘‘At 
the time, the CIA operative worked on 
loan to the White House,’’ and they are 
talking about the leftwing activist try-
ing to destroy President Trump, also 
known as the whistleblower. He was 
‘‘. . . on loan to the White House as a 
top Ukrainian analyst in the National 
Security Council, where he had pre-
viously served as an adviser on Ukraine 
to Vice President Biden. The whistle-
blower complaint cites Biden, alleging 
that Trump demanded Ukraine’s newly 
elected leader investigate him and his 
son ‘to help the President’s 2020 reelec-
tion bid.’ ’’ 
The thing is, there is no such thing. 
What basically the House managers are 
saying is, if somebody is running for 
President, it doesn’t matter how cor-
rupt they have been. It doesn’t matter 
how corrupt they and their family have 
been, you can’t question them if they 
are running for President because that 
might be considered political. 
Well, if there was corruption—and ev-
erybody knew there was plenty of cor-
ruption in Ukraine—and, apparently, 
no entity more corrupt than Burisma, 
the natural gas company that made 
Hunter Biden a member of the board, it 
is kind of important to find out what 
was at the heart of all this. 
It is interesting, the leftwing activist 
that was trying to destroy President 
Trump, also known as the whistle-
blower, and Sean Misko and Abigail 
Grace, they reportedly have been quite 
close to the National Security Council. 
And it was Misko and this leftwing ac-
tivist trying to destroy the President, 
also known as the whistleblower, who 
had been, as the article points out, 
overheard in the early days of the 
Trump administration trying to con-
spire on ways to take him out and get 
rid of him as President. 
But the truth is, it had to—these 
three, Misko, Abigail Grace, and the 
leftwing activist that was trying to de-
stroy Trump known as the whistle-
blower, 
they 
had 
dealings 
with 
Ukraine. They had dealings with Biden, 
and it is certainly worth noting that 
even in the inspector general’s report, 
there was mention of the name, by 
name, of this leftwing activist trying 
to destroy Trump, also known as the 
whistleblower, as being a guest, being 
associated with Vice President Biden. 
So if Vice President Biden, say, hypo-
thetically, were involved in any brib-
ery or plot to enrich family, then there 
is a good chance they would at least be 
witnesses, if not complicit. 
So there are plenty of reasons besides 
disagreeing with President Trump’s 
America First policy to try to stop any 
investigation into corruption by Vice 
President Biden because it may impli-
cate them or at least make them wit-
nesses to some of the stuff. 
I still was blown away when I got to 
a Natural Resources Committee hear-
ing one day and the person in charge of 
the tens of millions, hundreds of mil-
lions—whatever it was—dollars that 
the U.S. was providing to Puerto Rico 
for hurricane assistance, and the per-
son in charge of doling out this money 
in Puerto Rico was the same person 
who had been finance minister in 
Ukraine when they had all of this 
money—a billion or whatever it was— 
that they were dealing with from the 
Obama administration. 
It was amazing. And I asked: ‘‘How 
do you do that?’’ I mean, didn’t 
Ukrainians want—it wasn’t the defense 
minister but finance minister—‘‘Didn’t 
Ukrainians want a finance minister 
who was Ukrainian?’’ 
‘‘Yes,’’ she says. In essence, she said: 
They swore me in as a citizen of 
Ukraine the same way they swore me 
in as finance minister. 
How do you get jobs like that? You 
hear that the United States is going to 
send a billion, or hundreds of millions 
of dollars somewhere, and you run and 
get in front of that so you can get a job 
making sure the right people get all of 
that money. How does that happen? 
You can get a job handing out that 
money in Ukraine. You can get a job, 
same person, run over to Puerto Rico, 
‘‘I want to be in charge of the money 
here in Puerto Rico.’’ That is amazing. 
I am sure there were other people 
who would have loved to have had 
those jobs. How does this same person 
get that job in Puerto Rico and 
Ukraine? Maybe it is kind of like 
Strzok and Page. 
We saw in the Horowitz inspector 
general report from the Department of 
Justice—another great Obama hold-
over—he pointed out in his 60-or-so 
page report about Comey: Yeah, he 
says, you know, Comey, he took home 
material that was a violation to take 
home. He leaked it, got it into the 
press. 
Of course, he was trying, as he said, 
to get a special counsel appointed, 
which his conspiracy worked out well. 
He got a special counsel appointed, his 
running buddy, Bob Mueller, whom he 
had said in an article some years back 
something like: It is great knowing 
that if he were on a railroad track and 
a train were coming, that Bob Mueller 
would be right there with him. 
Yeah, well, that is interesting, but 
nonetheless, Horowitz pointed out that 
the 
reason 
that 
Comey 
probably 
wouldn’t be prosecuted, shouldn’t be— 
you know, we referred it—was because 
the information he leaked and that he 
took—some would say stole—but he 
took was classified at such a low level, 
it was really more of a violation of his 
employment agreement and the policy 
manual. 
Well, how did it get classified at such 
a very low level? Well, on page 1 and 2 
of the Horowitz report, he is talking 
about the FBI did this. They reviewed 
this. The FBI did this and that. Well, 
you don’t know until you get over to 
page 42 or 43 of this 60-or-so page report 
when he finally reveals—when he says 
the FBI on pages 1 and 2, he is talking 
about two people, Peter Strzok and 
Lisa Page. 
He has the gall to put in there that, 
in essence, the reason they were so 
good at doing this classification of the 
Comey stuff—if they classified it at a 
higher level, Comey would be pros-
ecuted and go to jail, so classify it at a 
low level so he wouldn’t—but they were 
so good at classifying the emails of Hil-
lary Clinton, that is why they were so 
qualified to do this for the Comey ma-
terial that was withheld, taken home, 
stolen, whatever you want to call it 
and leaked. 
So it is kind of the same thing here. 
Gee, these folks are experts. Why? Be-
cause they told us they were. That is 
what Strzok and Page said. You know, 
we are the best at reviewing and 
classifying. 
But this article from Paul Sperry 
goes on, and says about this that: ‘‘Two 
NSC coworkers told RCI’’—and I guess 
that is RealClear Investigations, doing 
this article—‘‘that they overheard’’ the 
leftwing activist trying to destroy 
President Trump, also known as the 
whistleblower, ‘‘and Misko—who was 
also working at the NSC as an ana-
lyst—making anti-Trump remarks to

each other while attending a staff-wide 
NSC meeting called by then-National 
Security Adviser Michael Flynn, where 
they sat together in the south audito-
rium of the Eisenhower Executive Of-
fice Building, part of the White House 
complex. 
‘‘The ‘all hands’ meeting, held about 
two weeks into the new administra-
tion, was attended by hundreds of NSC 
employees.’’ 
That has got to change. The Presi-
dent has got to dramatically cut the 
number of people who are part of the 
National Security Council. You can’t 
have security with that many people 
part of the National Security Council. 
The article points out: ‘‘They were 
popping off about how they were going 
to remove Trump from office.’’ 
This is back right after Trump took 
office. And this is a quote from the per-
son that disclosed this to Paul Sperry. 
‘‘No joke,’’ he said, or she, whoever it 
was. 
‘‘A military staffer detailed to the 
NSC, who was seated directly in front 
of’’ the leftwing activist trying to de-
stroy Trump, also known as the whis-
tleblower, ‘‘and Misko during the meet-
ing, confirmed hearing them talk about 
toppling Trump during their private 
conversation, which the source said 
lasted about one minute. The crowd 
was preparing to get up to leave the 
room at the time. 
‘‘After Flynn briefed the staff about 
what ‘America First’ foreign policy 
means,’’ the leftwing activist trying to 
destroy President Trump, also known 
as the whistleblower, ‘‘turned to Misko 
and commented, ‘We need to take him 
out.’ And Misko replied, ‘Yeah, we need 
to do everything we can to take out 
the President.’ 
‘‘Added the military detailee, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity: ‘By 
‘‘taking him out,’’ they meant remov-
ing him from office by any means nec-
essary.’ ’’ 
Of course, that’s this person’s im-
pression. Maybe they meant something 
else by ‘‘taking him out.’’ That was his 
impression, or her impression. 
‘‘They were triggered by Trump’s and 
Flynn’s vision for the world. This was 
the first ‘all hands’ staff meeting where 
they got to see Trump’s national secu-
rity team, and they were huffing and 
puffing throughout the briefing any 
time Flynn said something they didn’t 
like about ‘America First’. 
‘‘He said he also overheard’’ the left-
wing activist trying to destroy Presi-
dent Trump, also known as the whistle-
blower, ‘‘telling Misko, referring to 
Trump ‘We can’t let him enact this for-
eign policy.’ ’’ 
And I have got to say, that sounds re-
markably like colonel, lieutenant colo-
nel—I gave him a promotion there for a 
moment—Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman. 
Reviewing his testimony, as I am 
going 
through, 
I 
am 
going: 
Holy 
smoke, this guy is more loyal to 
Ukraine and the Ukrainian President 
than he is to the UCMJ, to his own 
Constitution, to his Commander in 
Chief. 
So I was not at all surprised when I 
found out the President of Ukraine, he 
noticed the same thing I did, and of-
fered Lieutenant Colonel Vindman— 
three times he offered him the job of 
Minister of Defense in Ukraine. 
b 2015 
This is just amazing. This guy clear-
ly did not like President Trump, and 
you could tell he was really offended. 
He was the expert on Ukraine, he knew 
what American foreign policy was sup-
posed to be, but he was totally igno-
rant of the Constitution that basically 
allows every President—as President 
Obama 
said, 
elections 
have 
con-
sequences. When President Trump got 
elected, he was the new foreign policy, 
and anyone in the administration who 
didn’t like President Trump’s foreign 
policy needed to leave. If they couldn’t 
follow it, if they couldn’t work with it 
and implement it, then they needed to 
be honest and honorable, instead of 
being destructive to our Constitution 
and our country and resign or ask for 
reassignment somewhere else. Or in 
Vindman’s case, go ahead and take the 
job of defense minister of Ukraine. 
But, of course, if he had done that, 
then he wouldn’t have looked very 
good when he came to testify because 
he wouldn’t have been wearing a uni-
form like he doesn’t wear to work, but 
he needed to hang around to try to de-
stroy President Trump. Of course, 
there are articles about him poten-
tially being the one who leaked the 
conversation to the leftwing activist 
trying to destroy President Trump also 
known as the whistleblower. 
In any event, this article says: 
‘‘Alarmed by their conversation, the 
military staffer immediately reported 
what he heard to his superiors. 
‘‘ ‘It was so shocking that they were 
so blatant and outspoken about their 
opinion. They weren’t shouting it, but 
they didn’t seem to feel the need to 
hide it.’ 
‘‘The coworkers didn’t think much 
more about the incident. 
‘‘ ‘We just thought they were wacky,’ 
the first source said. ‘Little did we 
know.’ ’’ 
‘‘A CIA alumnus, Misko had pre-
viously assisted Biden’s top national 
security aide Jake Sullivan. Former 
NSC staffers said Misko was,’’ the left-
wing activist trying to destroy Presi-
dent Trump, also known as the whistle-
blower ‘‘closest and most trusted ally 
in the Trump White House.’’ 
They were ‘‘ ‘very tight and spent 
nearly 2 years together at the NSC. 
. . . Both of them were paranoid about 
Trump.’ 
‘‘ ‘They were thick as thieves,’ added 
the first NSC source. ‘They sat next to 
each 
other 
and 
complained 
about 
Trump all the time. They were buddies. 
They weren’t just colleagues. They 
were buddies outside the White House.’ 
‘‘The February 2017 incident wasn’t 
the only time the pair exhibited open 
hostility toward the President. During 
the following months, both were ac-
cused internally of leaking negative in-
formation about Trump to the media. 
‘‘But Trump’s controversial call to 
the new president of Ukraine this past 
summer—in which he asked the foreign 
leader for help with domestic inves-
tigations involving the Obama admin-
istration, including Biden—gave them 
the opening they were looking for.’’ 
I would humbly submit, though, that 
if they were involved in any of the cor-
ruption that was going on over there 
with 
Burisma 
and 
Ukraine—and 
though many in the media want to 
take the talking points from our 
Democratic folks across the aisle, and 
one accused me of regurgitating Rus-
sian propaganda, when the truth is 
what the Russians have wanted, what 
Putin has wanted more than anything 
else was to divide the United States, 
because he knew dividing this country 
pretty much closely in the middle 
would help do what he has wanted to do 
since the Soviet Union fell and he was 
a KGB agent, and that is divide Amer-
ica so that it falls. That is exactly 
what he wants. 
We have heard—people don’t want to 
talk about it—but the truth is, there 
were some Russian efforts to help Hil-
lary Clinton in that election, which I 
think makes clear they wanted to di-
vide America and they have been to-
tally successful in dividing America. 
They have got to feel good about what 
they do as they watch the impeach-
ment proceedings. 
But anyone who would sit here and 
say I was quoting Russian propaganda, 
actually, that person would end up 
being the tool of the Russians because 
he is dividing America which is what 
Russia and Putin have wanted to do. 
He is doing the handiwork of Putin, 
not me. 
So I would still submit, as I have nu-
merous times, that critical fact wit-
nesses don’t necessarily need to be 
heard at this impeachment sham down 
the hall, but there do need to be wit-
nesses in very rigorous hearings in the 
Senate. 
They 
would 
be 
Alexandra 
Chalupa who worked with Ukraine, 
Biden, and others, the leftwing activist 
trying to destroy President Trump also 
known as the whistleblower, Abigail 
Grace, and the guy who Chairman 
SCHIFF hired on July 26, the day after 
President Trump’s good call with the 
President of Ukraine, Zelensky, the 
guy who ran on the basis that he was 
going to stop corruption. That was a 
great thing. 
He said: Why didn’t President Trump 
talk to the Ukrainians sooner about 
anti-corruption? 
It wasn’t until 2019 that they elected 
a new president who said he is going to 
do something about corruption. 
Why would he talk to the previous 
president who was in corruption up to 
his eyeballs? 
It wouldn’t do any good. 
But 
President 
Trump 
had 
hope. 
Whether it is a Republican or a Demo-
crat in the White House, I hope they

will seek help from any country in 
which there is corruption that involves 
American high officials. I hope that 
happens. 
But in the meantime, the impeach-
ment proceeding goes on down the hall, 
and it is dividing America. It is bad for 
America. We really need to come to-
gether and stop doing Russia’s handi-
work for them. They want us divided, 
and the people pushing this stuff are 
doing their handiwork for them. I am 
not saying intentionally. They are 
happy to do it to try to hurt Repub-
licans, especially to hurt President 
Trump, but this is serious. It is divid-
ing America. 
Again, my friends across the aisle, I 
love that they are quoting the Found-
ers these days, but we should hang to-
gether or we will most assuredly hang 
separately. We need to hang together 
as a country. We can have our disagree-
ments, but this wanting to criminalize 
disagreements as they have done with 
President Trump’s America First pol-
icy needs to stop. We need to come 
back together and get some things 
done. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
MUSLIM BAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, as part 
of the incredible, large class of mem-
bers of the Congressional Progressive 
Caucus, I am really proud to be here 
helping my colleagues translate a num-
ber of policy positions and issues and 
in being able to translate that into ac-
tion to various policies and to be able 
to express that. 
So this Special Order is very, very 
much an integral part of organizing 
within our caucus, the Congressional 
Progressive Caucus, on what we call 
frontline community issues. So I want 
to thank my colleagues for helping us 
organize today a Special Order hour to 
declare loudly and very clearly to 
every Muslim American and to Mus-
lims around the world that the House 
of Representatives will not stand idly 
by as this administration continues to 
enforce its racist Muslim ban. 
So with that I really rise today to 
send a message to marginalized com-
munities everywhere that through our 
work to repeal the Muslim ban we are 
preventing racist bans from ever hap-
pening again. 
I am so incredibly grateful for Con-
gresswoman CHU’s leadership of the Na-
tional Origin-Based Antidiscrimination 
for Nonimmigrants Act, or what we 
call the NO BAN Act. I thank Con-
gresswoman CHU for her leadership and 
courage to stand up to those who try to 
target folks based on their faith. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. JUDY 
CHU). 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
TLAIB for putting this Special Order 
hour together. I truly appreciate it, es-
pecially during this very, very signifi-
cant week. 
Monday marked the third anniver-
sary of the Muslim ban. We had a press 
conference on that day. It was incred-
ible to see the Senators and the House 
Members and so many groups of great 
diverse backgrounds all coming to-
gether to say that now is the time to 
pass H.R. 2214, the NO BAN Act. 
The failure of this ban was apparent 
the day it began. I will never forget 
that day in January of 2017, just 3 
years ago, when Donald Trump an-
nounced his first Muslim ban, creating 
chaos and separating families with no 
justification. I was on my way to a 
community event when I received a 
frantic call about 50 Muslims who were 
being detained at LAX for hours with 
no end in sight, despite the fact that 
they had green cards and were legal. 
At that point I decided to drop every-
thing and help in any way I could. I 
rushed over to LAX to advocate for 
these people, and once I arrived I found 
out that indeed there were scores of 
people there with a legal right to be 
here kept for hours with little food and 
blocked from receiving legal advice 
from an attorney. It was outrageous. 
When I pressed Customs and Border 
Protection for answers, they resisted 
and blocked me. I even got them on the 
phone only to have them hang up on 
me. I had never been more disrespected 
as a Member of Congress, but dis-
respect and chaos is what this Muslim 
ban is all about. 
The pain and psychological trauma 
this travel ban has caused are long 
lasting, spouses and fiances being sepa-
rated, weddings, funerals and gradua-
tions have been missed. People have 
not been able to come to take care of 
sick ones. Over 5,000 adopted children 
of U.S. citizens cannot join their fami-
lies. None of these people are a threat 
to the U.S., and we have every way of 
knowing that through our extensive 
vetting process. But they have been 
made victims of this hateful ban none-
theless. 
It just doesn’t have to be this way. 
When the Supreme Court upheld the 
President’s ability to issue these bans, 
the Court also required the administra-
tion to grant waivers to ensure that 
the program had a legitimate national 
security interest. But despite that re-
quirement, the State Department has 
approved only 10 percent of these appli-
cants. That means that the Trump ad-
ministration believes that 90 percent of 
all travelers from these countries are 
threats to our national security, and it 
renders this waiver process virtually 
nonexistent. 
That is outrageous. That is why we 
have to fight back, and that is why last 
spring I introduced the NO BAN Act 
with Senator Chris Coons, which is the 
best way to reclaim Congress’ power 
and stop this ban. 
First, it would repeal all three 
versions of President Trump’s Muslim 
ban, putting an immediate end to this 
family separation. 
Second, it requires a report on the 
total number of waivers that were 
granted and the total number that 
were denied, so we know the truth 
about what has happened. 
Third, our bill says that if a Presi-
dent does want to implement such a 
ban in the future he would actually 
have to prove actual evidence of a 
threat. This ensures in the future no 
individuals are denied entry into the 
U.S. based solely on their religion. 
b 2030 
With the President confirming that 
he now wants to expand this ban to 
even more countries, now is the time 
to act. 
The response to the NO BAN Act has 
been tremendous: 214 Members of Con-
gress have cosponsored the bill in the 
House, and over 480 groups have en-
dorsed it; 39 Members of the Senate are 
cosponsors. 
In September of 2019, the House Judi-
ciary and Foreign Affairs Committees 
held a joint hearing that examined how 
few waivers have been granted to indi-
viduals since the ban was issued, even 
though most people applying for entry 
into the U.S. pose no threat to our 
country. 
Just this week, Chairman NADLER 
announced that the bill will be marked 
up in the Judiciary Committee in 2 
weeks, and Speaker PELOSI announced 
that the NO BAN Act will be brought 
to the floor for a vote. 
This vote cannot happen soon enough 
for people like Ismail Alghazali, who 
will be my guest at the State of the 
Union next week. Ismail is a U.S. cit-
izen who works at a small neighbor-
hood market in New York, and, in 2013, 
he married his wife, Hend, in Yemen. 
Hend applied for a visa to join her hus-
band in the U.S., but before her inter-
view at the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti, 
Trump’s hateful Muslim ban went into 
effect. 
Hend was 8 months pregnant, and her 
pregnancy has been difficult. Doctors 
had discovered she had a heart condi-
tion. Ismail and Hend hoped that that 
meant that they would be granted a 
waiver due to medical reasons. But 
after an interview that lasted just 5 
minutes, Hend was denied a visa and 
left to give birth in Djibouti, while 
Ismail had to return to the U.S. He was 
not able to witness the birth of his first 
child. 
Last year, in April, Hend gave birth 
to another daughter, and Ismail has 
not been able to even meet his daugh-
ter for several months because of the 
ban. Luckily, however, the family has 
now been reunited in the United 
States. 
But too many others are left waiting 
for no reason, other than the Presi-
dent’s prejudice. 
We have every ability to vet people 
like Hend as we have done for years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H709 
January 29, 2020 
Leaving families divided by this ban is 
a choice. That is why we need the NO 
BAN Act. It is essential that we take 
away the President’s power to put prej-
udice into policy before more countries 
and more families are impacted by this 
hateful ban. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all my col-
leagues who are here tonight for their 
steadfast support of this bill, and I 
thank Congresswoman TLAIB. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, as one 
of its first acts, this White House de-
cided to ban Muslims from entering the 
United States by issuing an executive 
order prohibiting the entry of nation-
als of certain Muslim-majority coun-
tries. 
The 
people 
this 
administration 
banned are not all the same. They rep-
resent a diverse array of countries and 
cultures, including Arab communities, 
Black communities, Southeast Asian 
communities, amongst so many others. 
All around our Nation, especially in 
Michigan’s 13th District strong, we un-
derstand just how dangerous this ad-
ministration’s racist Muslim ban is for 
our families. The Muslim ban fuels 
anti-Muslim violence and discrimina-
tion. It promotes the dangerous myth 
that Muslims are inherently foreign, 
violent, and pose a threat to the United 
States. 
The Muslim ban also harms children. 
In the 2 years since it went into effect, 
countless families have been needlessly 
separated. People have been denied ac-
cess to lifesaving medical treatments. 
Children have been denied their par-
ents, access to their grandparents, and 
family members have missed births, 
deaths, weddings, and funerals for 
loved ones. 
I rise today to say that Muslims and 
Muslim Americans are our friends, our 
neighbors, and our family members— 
and, yes, they are also Members of Con-
gress. 
This White House might not like that 
fact very much, because the racist 
Muslim ban represents the Federal 
Government’s endorsement of an anti- 
Muslim discrimination culture. The 
policy endorses a fear-mongering cam-
paign that only serves to dehumanize 
and divide, and it leads us to question 
if this White House has any plans for 
our country that are not centered on 
hate or greed. 
I am extremely troubled that this 
federally 
sanctioned 
discrimination 
has contributed to a significant spike 
in hate crimes against American Mus-
lims and attacks on mosques in Muslim 
communities all across the country. 
That is why, as Members of Congress, 
we must put an end to discrimination 
by passing the NO BAN Act. We have 
over 200 Members of Congress who sup-
port and cosponsor this NO BAN Act. 
As introduced, the NO BAN Act 
would immediately rescind the Muslim 
ban and stop discriminatory orders and 
abuses of authority by this administra-
tion, thanks to the leadership of Con-
gresswoman JUDY CHU. 
By ending the Muslim ban, the NO 
BAN Act will also get us close to end-
ing the extreme number of increasing 
religious discrimination within our im-
migration system now. 
The bill would amend the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act, INA, to pro-
hibit discrimination on the basis of re-
ligion and ensure that no President 
ever again will be able to ban an entire 
community without accountability. 
I urge my colleagues in the House 
leadership to bring the NO BAN Act to 
the floor as soon as possible, because 
our communities cannot wait. Minor-
ity communities across our country 
and, indeed, the international commu-
nity are eager for action that repeals 
the Muslim ban. 
As someone who is raising two Mus-
lim boys in our country, I can tell you 
they struggle now even sharing about 
their faith and even worried about the 
rhetoric that they hear from various 
folks in school, but also just in passing, 
not only through social media, but 
through different kinds of conversa-
tions that they are hearing where they 
talk about not only folks who are of 
the Muslim faith, but folks of various 
immigrant communities. And being 
two sons of a father who is also an im-
migrant, they now really struggle very 
much in feeling that they can be open. 
At 9 years old, my son, who is now 14, 
remembers me—I remember speaking 
to his father about a terrible ad, a car-
toon that was put in USA Today, where 
it depicted Muslims in a certain way 
that would evoke violence towards 
Muslim Americans. I remember talking 
to his father at that moment and just 
kind of whispering to him: This is ter-
rible. I can’t believe they are doing 
this. This is just going to invoke people 
to really hate and even want to kill 
Muslims. 
And my son, who came into the bed-
room, said: Don’t worry, Mama. If any-
body asks if I am Muslim, I will tell 
them that I am not. 
That is the kind of culture that we 
create by allowing these kinds of dis-
criminatory policies to be placed and 
for us to allow it to be codified through 
executive orders and allow it to go 
without any action. 
I ran a campaign to take on hate, 
which really started in Michigan, but 
was implemented throughout the coun-
try in about 12 communities. 
And one of the things that young 
people understand is you have got to 
take on hate with action. You can’t sit 
idly back—because people just thought: 
Well, this doesn’t impact me—but real-
ly trying to understand that it does 
connect all of us; because this form of 
othering in the culture that you see 
within the administration is real and it 
is dangerous, and sitting idly by and 
not doing anything about it, to me, 
will increase that form of hate towards 
people of different faiths. 
And trust me, it is not just about 
Muslims. It is about other kinds of 
faiths, people of different ethnic back-
grounds. 
This, in essence, is creating this kind 
of hate culture that we can’t see, not 
only in our American society, but it is 
also festering within our school culture 
and with our young people again ques-
tioning constantly with identity and 
allowing this kind of othering to be 
normalized through acts like this exec-
utive order. 
When you hear Muslim leaders and 
those talk about the separation that 
happens, I remember at Bridging Com-
munities in southwest Detroit, we had 
a 
press 
conference 
with 
Congress-
woman DEBBIE DINGELL fighting back 
against the separation of families, and 
it all stemmed around: Well, I didn’t 
understand there was supposed to have 
been a waiver. 
Well, everyone should know, many of 
the people we represent who are com-
ing to our offices were not granted 
waivers. 
And we are talking about people who 
are married, who have legal access 
through the immigration, but for the 
Muslim ban, and are not able to re-
unify with their family members. 
I have two young children who can’t 
see their father because of the Muslim 
ban. 
I have folks who had a green card, 
had access to the United States, but 
when this got implemented, because it 
was implemented in a way where there 
was no notice, no policy, no proce-
dures, no structure in place for folks on 
the ground to understand what was 
going on, that is why we saw what we 
saw, the overwhelming call for action 
and people showing up to airports all 
across the country saying: No, not now, 
not ever. 
It is really important that we do it 
through action within the Congress, 
and I hope my colleagues understand 
this should be bipartisan support. 
This is religious discrimination. This 
is one of our core values as Americans. 
We are founded on religious freedom. 
And for us to allow, again, targeting of 
folks solely based on their faith, to me, 
repeats history. We have done it in the 
past; and it wasn’t right then, and it 
isn’t right now. 
And I think I can speak on behalf of 
Muslim Americans. They do not want 
to wait for an apology. Apology is not 
enough. They want action today. They 
know this is discriminatory. They 
know this is bias. They know this is 
targeting Muslims. 
And, yes, it is leading to, again, in-
creased hate crimes towards Muslims 
in huge amounts across the country; 
and so it is critical that we act, that 
we don’t sit silently by, because doing 
nothing is not an option anymore. So I 
urge the House leadership to bring this 
NO BAN Act forward to the floor as 
soon as possible. 
I really commend the incredible lead-
ership of many of our colleagues, espe-
cially my good colleague from Indiana, 
Congressman ANDRE´
CARSON, whom I 
lovingly call the dean of the Muslim 
Caucus. 
Yes, we are your neighbors; we are 
your advocates; we are your doctors, 
your teachers, and all of those things, 
and also your Members of Congress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H710 
January 29, 2020 
And so, again, it is really critically 
important that we push back against 
this ban. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. CARSON). 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank Con-
gresswoman TLAIB for her leadership, 
for her friendship, for all that she does 
not for just her constituents, but for 
Muslims, non-Muslims, and Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the NO BAN Act, which was a 
great opportunity for me to be a co-
author, and I urge Congress to swiftly 
pass this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, in the 3 years since 
President 
Trump 
implemented 
his 
Muslim ban, its dangerous impact is 
clearer than ever: Families remain 
torn apart, America is less respected 
around the world, and our country isn’t 
any safer. 
But for this President and for all of 
those who crafted this ban, this policy 
was never about national security. 
Since his first day in office, he has 
worked to advance a dangerous white 
nationalist agenda, and the Muslim 
ban is its cornerstone. 
It is no surprise, then, that he may 
be planning to expand this ban to even 
more countries, many in Africa, which 
he has previously described in some of 
the most vulgar and offensive ways. 
As a Muslim and as a Black man, it 
pains me to witness this low moment 
in our country. It is not the only time 
America has shut its doors to people in 
need simply because of their race, eth-
nicity, and nationality; but, thank-
fully, we can make it the last time. 
Madam Speaker, that is why it is so 
important that we pass the NO BAN 
Act to end the Muslim ban and make 
sure history no longer repeats itself in 
this way. 
Our legislation has more than 200 co-
sponsors in the House and the endorse-
ment of nearly 400 diverse civil rights, 
faith, national security, and commu-
nity organizations. Americans of all 
backgrounds are behind this great bill 
and are demanding Congress to pass it, 
to take a bold stand against bigotry. 
So I am extremely pleased that the NO 
BAN Act is expected to be taken up by 
the Judiciary Committee next month. 
As my colleague, Congresswoman 
TLAIB said, and I want to reaffirm, 
Muslims are part of what makes this 
country great. 
b 2045 
Muslims have been a part of this 
country since the inception of what we 
now know to be America. Ever since 
those West African slaves were brought 
here to America, Muslims have con-
tributed to our country. 
Go to any major courtroom, and you 
will find a Muslim lawyer, maybe a 
judge. Go to any major hospital in this 
great country, and you will find a Mus-
lim physician. There are Muslim engi-
neers, Muslim scientists, Muslim edu-
cators, Muslim politicians. You have 
three in Congress. We will see more in 
the future, God willing. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues and all Americans who believe 
in equality for all people to support the 
NO BAN Act. Together, we will get it 
passed and begin a new chapter in our 
country’s history. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Indiana. 
I really appreciate the incredible 
public service that not only stems here 
but, as you all know, many of our serv-
icemen and women who are of Muslim 
faith are serving our country every sin-
gle day. 
Again, people need not try to sepa-
rate us as not being part of this amaz-
ing country. The Muslim ban com-
pletely tears that down and comes 
from, again, a place of hate that we 
need to push back against. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL), who I really honor and re-
spect, the co-chair of the Congressional 
Progressive Caucus, my good colleague, 
one of the fighters within this Chamber 
every single day for communities of 
color and marginalized communities. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her incred-
ible leadership. It has been wonderful 
working with her not just here in this 
body and in the Congressional Progres-
sive Caucus, which I am proud to co- 
chair, but for years we have known 
each other and worked together. It is 
wonderful to have her here to talk 
about this issue and her leadership on 
this issue, really the kind of leadership 
that America needs to show by passing 
the NO BAN Act. 
Three years ago, I had just been 
elected to Congress, and it was within 
my first weeks here that Donald 
Trump issued his first Muslim ban. 
When that happened, I thought back to 
after 9/11—that is actually when I 
started becoming very involved in poli-
tics as an activist. We faced some simi-
lar situations of Muslims, Arab Ameri-
cans, and others being targeted simply 
for their religion, their ethnicity, their 
place of origin. 
The good news is that I knew what to 
do, which is that I immediately rushed 
to the airport. That Muslim ban cre-
ated irreparable harm on Muslim fami-
lies, here at home, but also around the 
world. 
We had generals in our military tes-
tify that we desperately need to have 
our allies and that some of those allies 
are, in fact, Muslims who help us in 
other countries. 
When I heard the news and rushed to 
SeaTac Airport, I saw absolute chaos, 
chaos that was caused by an adminis-
tration that put forward a Muslim ban 
with no preparation, no notification, 
no planning at all for the kind of harm, 
irreparable harm, that would be caused 
for American citizens, for lawful resi-
dents, and for international visitors. 
Today, families remain separated 
from their loved ones, American busi-
nesses, and research institutions. I 
have many of those research institu-
tions in my district and many Amer-
ican businesses in my district that are 
not able to recruit the best minds from 
abroad. 
Our Nation’s doors are closed to peo-
ple seeking safety from violence, war, 
and persecution. 
But it wasn’t just then. The chaos 
has not stopped. 
Earlier this month, up to 200 Iranian 
Americans—almost all the ones that 
we know of are U.S. citizens, legal per-
manent residents, green-card holders— 
were unjustly detained at the U.S.-Can-
ada border in my own State of Wash-
ington. 
In the days after the Muslim ban, I 
had introduced the Access to Counsel 
Act, an act that once again was so im-
portant as we watched these detentions 
of Iranian Americans, who, by the way, 
travel across the border regularly. In 
fact, some of them travel across the 
border so much that they have expe-
dited processing. 
What that means is that you go 
through additional security screening 
so that you can get a card that you 
hold up at the northern border as you 
cross the border. You don’t need any-
thing else other than that expedited 
screening, that extra security screen-
ing in order to cross the border. 
But that day, we believe over 200 Ira-
nian Americans were stopped at the 
border, U.S. citizens, legal green-card 
holders, simply because they were of 
Iranian descent. 
The Access to Counsel Act, which we 
hope to mark up and bring to the floor 
at the same time as the NO BAN Act, 
just says that if you were here as a 
U.S. citizen, a legal permanent resi-
dent, or have any legal status and you 
are put through this unjust secondary 
screening, that at least you can have 
access to counsel, not counsel paid for 
by the government, but just counsel 
provided either through your own 
pocket or through nonprofits that pro-
vide that service, because people are 
being deported in an expedited manner. 
In fact, that is what happened in Se-
attle 3 years ago when I rushed to the 
airport when the Muslim ban was first 
introduced. We actually were able to, 
at the airport, get a temporary injunc-
tion from a judge that allowed us to es-
sentially go and stop a plane on the 
tarmac that was ready to take off with 
some people who should not have been 
deported. 
We were able to stop that plane from 
taking off, thanks to the courts and 
the incredible speed of attorneys and 
nonprofit organizations that came to-
gether and filed for a temporary in-
junction. That allowed us to stop the 
plane and to stop people from actually 
being deported. 
It is not right that we are seeing U.S. 
citizens detained by CBP for up to 9 
hours without a chance to speak to a 
lawyer simply because they weren’t 
born here, even though they are United 
States citizens. 
It is not right that students with 
visas have increasingly been rejected 
at our airports and deported without a

chance to speak to a lawyer, when peo-
ple have legal status in the United 
States. 
It is not right that they are subjected 
to a second loyalty test simply because 
of their religion or their place of birth 
or their ethnicity. 
Madam Speaker, I am one of only 14 
immigrants in the United States Con-
gress, out of 535 naturalized citizens, 
who have the great honor and privilege 
of being a United States citizen. I don’t 
want us to think that we have separate 
loyalty tests that we have to go 
through. We have examples of that— 
the Japanese internment, 123,000 Amer-
icans of Japanese ancestry who were 
put into internment camps simply for 
being Japanese American. 
The reality is we need the NO BAN 
Act to repeal President Trump’s Mus-
lim ban and stop any future President 
from implementing future discrimina-
tory bans. 
I am very grateful to my colleague, 
Congresswoman JUDY CHU, chair of the 
Congressional Asian Pacific American 
Caucus, for introducing and cham-
pioning this critical bill to send an im-
portant message to our Muslim broth-
ers and sisters here and abroad that 
America believes in religious liberty 
and that we remain committed to wel-
coming people regardless of their faith, 
regardless of the country in which they 
were born. 
In recent weeks, we have heard that 
an expanded Muslim ban may be com-
ing from the Trump administration 
this week. Let me be very clear: Each 
iteration of these bans sends a terrible 
message to Muslims, to those who are 
targeted, that our foundational value 
of freedom of religion does not apply to 
them. 
An expanded Muslim ban will only 
worsen our relationships with coun-
tries around the world, and it will not 
make our country safer. It will harm 
refugees. It will isolate us from our al-
lies. It will give extremists propaganda 
for recruitment. It will be a different 
Muslim 
ban 
pushed 
by 
the 
same 
xenophobic administration, and it will 
have the same negative ramifications 
as past versions of the Muslim ban. 
Madam Speaker, I just had the oppor-
tunity to come back from a codel to 
Sudan with a number of our Members, 
Republican and Democrat. This is a 
country that is transitioning from a 30- 
year dictatorship to a democracy, a ci-
vilian-led government. That was pow-
ered by a people’s revolution in the 
streets that inspired us here in the 
United States and around the world, 
people who sat and peacefully pro-
tested a brutal dictatorship. Over 200 
people were shot and killed in those 
peaceful protests on June 3. 
Madam Speaker, Sudan has been sup-
posedly added to this next round of 
countries that may be added to the 
Muslim ban. The people of Sudan said 
to us, Republican and Democratic Rep-
resentatives of the United States Gov-
ernment: ‘‘Doesn’t America believe in 
democracy, in transition?’’ 
Why would Sudan, with a people’s 
revolution that led to a democratic 
government through the overthrow of a 
dictator who has been in power for the 
last 30 years, why would Sudan be on a 
list of countries that have these re-
strictions and be part of this ban? That 
sends the totally wrong message. 
As the vice chair of the Committee 
on the Judiciary’s Subcommittee on 
Immigration and Citizenship, I will do 
everything in my power to resist the 
Muslim ban and demand liberty and 
justice for all, without any caveats. 
We must pass the NO BAN Act to end 
not just the Muslim ban but other anti- 
immigrant policies pushed by this ad-
ministration. Most importantly, we 
must pass the NO BAN Act to remind 
ourselves again of who we are as a 
country, a country that has welcomed 
people from all over the world, includ-
ing myself. 
I came here as a 16-year-old with 
nothing in my pockets, by myself, and 
to now be standing here in the United 
States Congress, my responsibility— 
our responsibility as a body is to pre-
serve those foundational values of free-
dom and justice and religious toler-
ance. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
passing the NO BAN Act. I thank Rep-
resentative TLAIB for her friendship, 
for her leadership, and for all that she 
does to advance justice. On behalf of 
the Progressive Caucus, 100-members 
strong, we are so glad to have her in it. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman. Her incredible lead-
ership and mentorship are so inspiring 
but also completely fuels my commit-
ment to be centered around social jus-
tice and equality. 
Madam Speaker, I wanted to make 
sure that we talk about the fact that 
because of the Muslim ban and some of 
the kind of hate agenda policies that 
we see coming out of the administra-
tion, it all has resulted in an increase 
of hate crimes that still is under-
reported and has not, I think, truly, 
under this administration, been docu-
mented by the FBI. 
Even when the current President just 
called for a total and complete shut-
down on Muslims entering the United 
States, just days after that report, hate 
crimes against Muslims and Arabs na-
tionwide spiked up 23 percent. 
As we hear about the various kinds of 
hate crimes, we get some of these com-
plaints and incidents being reported to 
even our offices. I wanted to make sure 
that we talk about the fact that the 
FBI, when it released its report this 
past year, that Muslim advocates in 
their statement—which is very accu-
rate, based on what we hear of our 
community members at home—said 
that, yet again, the FBI annual statis-
tics on hate crimes show us that the 
worrying numbers of Muslims, Jews, 
Sikhs, and Latinos being victimized by 
hate crimes are not being reported, or 
the data does not reflect that. It is not 
a complete, accurate picture of the epi-
demic of hate that continues to threat-
en the safety of so many Americans 
across the country. 
Last year, an armed man drove a 
truck into a convenience store in Lou-
isiana because he suspected the owners 
were Muslims. Also in March last year, 
a man deliberately tried to drive his 
car into a Muslim family in a parking 
lot in California and managed to strike 
the father twice. 
Both are clear examples of hate 
crimes. Neither of those were included 
in the FBI’s data on hate crimes. 
Madam Speaker, it is completely un-
acceptable. As we push for the NO BAN 
Act, I also want to try to encourage my 
colleagues to try to have hearings and 
discuss the importance of accurate 
data around hate crimes increasing 
across the country. That is why we 
have to pass the Khalid Jabara and 
Heather Heyer NO HATE Act to im-
prove the hate crime reporting data 
collection. 
b 2100 
Many of the organizations that sup-
port the NO BAN Act also want to see 
a much better reflection of the data 
being reported by the FBI around hate 
crime. 
The only way we are able to promote 
or push back against these forms of 
hate that lead to violence, and even 
death, for so many folks that are im-
pacted by these forms of racist policies 
and hateful agenda policies, is to be 
able to document and to push back 
against it. 
So I really appreciate a number of 
my colleagues, over 200 Members that 
support the NO BAN Act, and I look 
forward to finally being able to vote for 
it on the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 29, 2020 
No. 19 
Senate 
The Senate met at 1:13 p.m. and was 
called to order by the Chief Justice of 
the United States. 
f 
TRIAL 
OF 
DONALD 
J. 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will convene as a Court of Impeach-
ment. 
The Chaplain will lead us in prayer. 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Divine Shepherd, honor, glory, and 
power belong to You. Refresh our Sen-
ators as they enter a new phase of this 
impeachment trial. May they realize 
that You have appointed them for this 
great service, and they are accountable 
to You. 
Lord, empower them to labor today 
with the dominant purpose of pleasing 
You, knowing that it is never wrong to 
do right. Give them resiliency in their 
toil, as they remember Your promise 
that they will reap a bountiful harvest 
if they don’t give up. Help them to fol-
low the road of humility that leads to 
honor, as they find their safety in 
trusting You. 
We pray in Your majestic Name. 
Amen. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Chief Justice led the Pledge of 
Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
THE JOURNAL 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no 
objection, the Journal of proceedings of 
the trial is approved to date. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Sergeant at Arms will make the 
proclamation. 
The Sergeant at Arms, Michael C. 
Stenger, made proclamation as follows: 
Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are 
commanded to keep silent, on pain of impris-
onment, while the Senate of the United 
States is sitting for the trial of the articles 
of impeachment exhibited by the House of 
Representatives against Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
today the Senate will conduct up to 8 
hours of questions to the parties deliv-
ered in writing to the Chief Justice. As 
a reminder, the two sides will alternate 
and answers should be kept to 5 min-
utes or less. 
The majority side will lead off with a 
question from the Senator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator is 
recognized. 
Ms. COLLINS. I send a question to 
the desk on behalf of myself, Senator 
MURKOWSKI, and Senator ROMNEY. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a ques-
tion for the counsel for the President: 
If President Trump had more than one mo-
tive for his alleged conduct, such as the pur-
suit of personal political advantage, rooting 
out corruption, and the promotion of na-
tional interests, how should the Senate con-
sider more than one motive in its assessment 
of article I? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, in response to that 
question, there are really two layers to 
my answer because I would like to 
point out first that, even if there was 
only one motive, the theory of abuse of 
power that the House managers have 
presented, that the subjective motive 
alone can become the basis for an im-
peachable offense, we believe is con-
stitutionally defective. It is not a per-
missible way to frame a claim of an 
impeachable offense under the Con-
stitution. 
I will put that aside and address the 
question of mixed motive. If there were 
a motive that was of public interest 
and also of some personal interest, we 
think it follows even more clearly that 
that cannot possibly be the basis for an 
impeachable offense. Even the House 
managers, as they have framed their 
case, they have explained—and this is 
pointed out in our trial memorandum— 
that in the House Judiciary Committee 
report, they specify that the standard 
they have to meet is to show that this 
is a sham investigation; it is a bogus 
investigation. 
These 
investigations 
have—there is not any legitimate pub-
lic purpose. That is the language: any 
‘‘legitimate public purpose.’’ That is 
the standard they have set for them-
selves in being able to make this claim 
under their theory of what an abuse of 
power offense can be. 
It is a very demanding standard that 
they have set for themselves to meet, 
and they have even said—they came 
up, and they talked a lot about the 
Bidens. They talked a lot about these 
issues and 2016 election interference be-
cause they were saying there is not 
even a scintilla—a scintilla of any evi-
dence of anything worth looking into 
there. And that is the standard that 
they would have to meet, showing that 
there is no possible public interest and 
the President couldn’t have had any 
smidgeon, even, of a public interest 
motive because they recognize that 
once you get into a mixed-motive situ-
ation—if there is both some personal 
motive but also a legitimate public in-
terest motive—it can’t possibly be an 
offense because it would be absurd to 
have the Senate trying to consider: 
Well, was it 48 percent legitimate in-
terest and 52 percent personal interest 
or was it the other way, was it 53 per-
cent and 47 percent? You can’t divide it 
that way. 
That is why they recognize that to 
have even a remotely coherent theory, 
the standard they have to set for them-
selves is establishing there is no pos-
sible public interest at all for these in-
vestigations. And if there is any possi-
bility, if there is something that shows 
a possible public interest and the Presi-
dent could have that possible public in-
terest motive, that destroys their case. 
So once you are into mixed-motive

January 29, 2020 
land, it is clear that their case fails. 
There can’t possibly be an impeachable 
offense at all. 
Think about it. All elected officials, 
to some extent, have in mind how their 
conduct, how their decisions, their pol-
icy decisions will affect the next elec-
tion. There is always some personal in-
terest in the electoral outcome of pol-
icy decisions, and there is nothing 
wrong with that. That is part of rep-
resentative democracy. And to start 
saying now that, well, if you have a 
part motive that is for your personal 
electoral gain that that somehow is 
going to become an offense, it doesn’t 
make any sense and it is totally un-
workable and it can’t be a basis for re-
moving a President from office. 
The bottom line is, once you are into 
any mixed-motive situation, once it is 
established that there is a legitimate 
public interest that could justify look-
ing into something, just asking a ques-
tion about something, the managers’ 
case fails, and it fails under their own 
terms. They recognize that they have 
to show no possible public interest. 
There isn’t any legitimate public inter-
est, and they have totally failed to 
make that case. 
I think we have shown very clearly 
that both of the things that were men-
tioned, 2016 election interference and 
the 
Biden-Burisma 
situation, 
are 
things that raise at least some public 
interest; there is something worth 
looking at there. It has never been in-
vestigated in the Biden situation. Lots 
of their own witnesses from the State 
Department said that on its face it ap-
pears to be a conflict of interest. It is 
at least worth raising a question about 
or asking a question about it. And 
there is that public interest, and that 
means their case absolutely fails. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Demo-
cratic leader asks of the House man-
agers: 
John R. Bolton’s forthcoming book states 
that the President wanted to continue with-
holding $391 million in military aid to 
Ukraine until Ukraine announced investiga-
tions into his top political rival and the de-
bunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 
election. Is there any way for the Senate to 
render a fully informed verdict in this case 
without hearing the testimony of Bolton, 
Mulvaney, and the other key eyewitnesses or 
without seeing the relevant documentary 
evidence? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
The short answer to that question is 
no. There is no way to have a fair trial 
without witnesses. And when you have 
a witness who is as plainly relevant as 
John Bolton, who goes to the heart of 
the most serious and egregious of the 
President’s misconduct, who has volun-
teered to come and testify, to turn him 
away, to look the other way, I think, is 
deeply at odds with being an impartial 
juror. 
I would also add, in response to the 
last question, that if any part of the 
President’s motivation was a corrupt 
motive, if it was a causal factor in the 
action to freeze the aid or withhold the 
meeting, that is enough to convict. It 
would be enough to convict under 
criminal law. 
But here there is no question about 
the President’s motivation. And if you 
have any question about the Presi-
dent’s motivation, it makes it all the 
more essential to call the man who 
spoke directly with the President, 
whom the President confided in and 
said he was holding up this aid because 
he wanted Ukraine to conduct these 
political investigations that would help 
him in the next election—if you have 
any question about whether it was a 
factor, the factor, a quarter of the fac-
tor, all of the factor, there is a witness 
a subpoena away who could answer 
that question. 
But the overwhelming body of the 
evidence makes it very clear, on July 
26, the day after that phone call, Don-
ald Trump speaks to Gordon Sondland. 
That is that conversation at a Ukraine 
restaurant. 
What 
does 
Gordon 
Sondland—what 
is 
the 
President’s 
question of Gordon Sondland the day 
after that call? Is he going to do the in-
vestigations? 
Counsel for the President would have 
you believe the President was con-
cerned about the burden-sharing. Well, 
he may have had a generic concern 
about the burden-sharing in other con-
texts, but here the motivation was 
abundantly clear. On that phone with 
Gordon Sondland, the only question he 
wanted an answer to was, Is he going to 
do the investigation? 
Now, bear in mind he is talking to 
the 
Ambassador 
to 
the 
European 
Union. What better person to talk to if 
his real concern was about burden- 
sharing than the guy responsible for 
Europe’s burden-sharing? But did the 
President raise this at all? Of course 
not. Of course not. And if you have any 
question about it at all, you need to 
hear from his former National Security 
Advisor. Don’t wait for the book. Don’t 
wait until March 17, when it is in black 
and white, to find out the answer to 
your question: Was it all the motive, 
some of the motive, or none of the mo-
tive? 
We think, as I mentioned, the case is 
overwhelmingly clear without John 
Bolton, but if you have any question 
about it, you can erase all doubt. 
Let me show a video to underscore— 
No. 2, slide 2—how important this is. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. As House man-
agers, really their goal should be to give you 
all of the facts because they are asking you 
to do something very, very consequential 
. . . and ask yourself, ask yourself, given the 
facts you heard today that they didn’t tell 
you, who doesn’t want to talk about the 
facts? Who doesn’t want to talk about the 
facts? 
Impeachment shouldn’t be a shell game. 
They should give you the facts. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. One last video, 
which is even more important and on 
point for Mr. Bolton—No. 3. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. And once again, 
not a single witness in the House record that 
they compiled and developed under their pro-
cedures that we discussed and will continue 
to discuss provided any firsthand evidence 
that the President ever linked the Presi-
dential meeting to any of the investigations. 
Anyone who spoke with the President said 
that the President made it clear that there 
was no linkage between security assistance 
and investigations. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. We know that 
is not correct, right? Because, of 
course, Mick Mulvaney said that the 
money was linked to these investiga-
tions. He said, in acknowledging a quid 
pro quo, that they do it all the time, 
and we should just get over it. Gordon 
Sondland also said the President said, 
on the one hand, no quid pro quo but 
also made it clear that Zelensky had to 
go to the mic and announce these in-
vestigations. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The gentle-
man’s time has expired. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
The Senator is recognized. 
Mr. THUNE. I have a question for the 
President’s counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. To the Presi-
dent’s counsel: 
Would you please respond to the argu-
ments or assertions the House managers just 
made in response to the previous question? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, a couple of points that I 
would like to make. 
Manager SCHIFF suggested that there 
was no evidence the President was ac-
tually interested in burden-sharing be-
cause he didn’t, apparently, according 
to David Hale, raise it in the telephone 
conversation 
he 
had 
with 
Gordon 
Sondland that Hale seems to have over-
heard in a restaurant in Kiev. 
Let’s look at the real evidence. 
As we explained, on June 24, there is 
an email in the record. It is an email 
from one person at the Department of 
Defense to another, with the subject 
line: ‘‘POTUS’ follow-up’’—President of 
the United States’ follow-up—asking 
specifically about burden-sharing. 
It reads: ‘‘What do other NATO mem-
bers spend to support Ukraine?’’ 
That was what they were following 
up on for the President. 
In the transcript of the July 25 call 
itself, the President said: 
We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time 
on Ukraine, much more than the European 
countries are doing, and they should be help-
ing you more than we are. Germany does al-
most nothing for you. All they do is talk, 
and I think it is something you should really 
ask them about. 
He goes on to say that he talks to 
Angela Merkel about it and that they 
are not really doing as much as the 
United States is doing. He is raising 
burden-sharing, 
and 
President 
Zelensky agreed with him. 
Manager SCHIFF also suggested that 
there is evidence of some connection

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S647 
January 29, 2020 
between the military assistance and in-
vestigations into 2016 election inter-
ference because of a statement that 
Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney made 
at a press conference, but that has been 
made clear in the record, since that 
press conference, that what he was say-
ing was garbled and/or misunderstood. 
He immediately clarified and said on 
that date: ‘‘The President never told 
me to withhold any money until the 
Ukrainians did anything related to the 
server.’’ 
Similarly, he issued a statement just 
the other day, making clear again— 
this is from his counsel; so it is phrased 
in the third person: ‘‘. . . nor did Mr. 
Mulvaney ever have a conversation 
with the President or anyone else indi-
cating that Ukrainian military aid was 
withheld in exchange for the Ukrainian 
investigation of Burisma, the Bidens, 
or the 2016 election.’’ 
That was Mr. Mulvaney’s statement. 
Lastly, as to the point of whether 
this Chamber should hear from Ambas-
sador Bolton—and I think it is impor-
tant to consider what that means, be-
cause it is not just a question of, well, 
should we just hear one witness? That 
is not what the real question is going 
to be. 
For this institution, the real ques-
tion is, What is the precedent that is 
going to be set for what is an accept-
able way for the House of Representa-
tives to bring an impeachment of a 
President of the United States to this 
Chamber, and can it be done in a hur-
ried, half-baked, partisan fashion? 
They didn’t even subpoena John 
Bolton. They didn’t even try to get his 
testimony. To insist now that this 
body will become the investigative 
body—that this body will have to do all 
of the discovery—then, this institution 
will 
be 
effectively 
paralyzed 
for 
months on end because it will have to 
sit as a Court of Impeachment while 
now discovery will be done. It would be 
Ambassador Bolton, and if there are 
going to be witnesses, in order for 
there to be, as they said, a fair trial, 
fair adjudication, then, the President 
would have to have his opportunity to 
call his witnesses, and there would be 
depositions. This would drag on for 
months. Then that will be the new 
precedent. Then that is the way all im-
peachments will operate in the future, 
where the House doesn’t have to do the 
work—it does it quickly and throws it 
over the transom—and this institution 
gets derailed and has to deal with it. 
That should not be the precedent that 
is set here for the way this body will 
have to handle all impeachments in the 
future, because, if it becomes that easy 
for the House to do it, it will be doing 
it a lot. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator MARKEY to the House 
managers: 
On Monday, President Trump tweeted, 
‘‘The Democrat controlled House never even 
asked John Bolton to testify.’’ So that the 
record is accurate, did House impeachment 
investigators ask Mr. Bolton to testify? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, the 
answer is yes. Of course, we asked John 
Bolton to testify in the House, and he 
refused. We asked his deputy, Dr. 
Kupperman, to testify, and he refused. 
Fortunately, we asked their deputy, 
Dr. Fiona Hill, to testify, and she did. 
We 
asked 
her 
deputy, 
Colonel 
Vindman, to testify, and he did. We did 
seek the testimony of John Bolton as 
well as Dr. Kupperman, and they re-
fused. 
When we subpoenaed Dr. Kupperman, 
he sued us. He took us to court. When 
we 
raised 
a 
subpoena 
with 
John 
Bolton’s counsel, the same counsel for 
Dr. Kupperman, the answer was, ‘‘Sen-
ator, you serve us with a subpoena, and 
we will sue you, too.’’ We knew, based 
on the McGahn litigation, it would 
take months, if not years, to force 
John Bolton to come and testify. 
Because, I think, this is an essential 
point to underscore, as the President’s 
lawyers say, ‘‘They didn’t try hard 
enough to get John Bolton,’’ or ‘‘they 
should 
have 
subpoenaed 
John 
Bolton’’—that this is what they are 
telling you—let me show you what 
they are telling the court in the 
McGahn litigation, if we could pull up 
slide 39. 
This is from the President’s lawyers 
who are in the court of appeals right 
now in the McGahn litigation: ‘‘The 
committee [meaning our committee] 
lacks article III standing to sue to en-
force a congressional subpoena de-
manding testimony from an individual 
on matters related to his duties as an 
Executive Branch official.’’ 
I mean, it takes your breath away, 
the duplicity of that argument. They 
are before you, saying: They should 
have tried harder to get these wit-
nesses. They should have subpoenaed. 
They should have litigated for years; 
and down the street in the Federal 
courthouse, they are arguing: Judge, 
you need to throw them out. They have 
no standing to sue to force a witness to 
testify. 
Are we really prepared to accept 
that? 
Counsel says to think about the 
precedent we would be setting if you 
allow the House to impeach a President 
and you permit them to call witnesses. 
I would submit: Think about the prece-
dent you would be setting if you don’t 
allow witnesses in a trial. That, to me, 
is the much more dangerous precedent 
here. 
I will tell you something even more 
dangerous, and this was something 
that we anticipated from the very be-
ginning, which is that we understood, 
when we got to this point, they could 
no longer contest the facts that the 
President withheld military aid from 
an ally at war to coerce that ally into 
doing the President’s political dirty 
work. So now they have fallen back on, 
You shouldn’t hear any further evi-
dence or any further witnesses on this 
subject. 
What is more, we are going to use the 
end-all argument: So what? The Presi-
dent is free to abuse his power. We are 
going to rely on a constitutional the-
ory—a fringe theory—that even the ad-
vocate of which says is outside the con-
sensus of constitutional law to say that 
a President can abuse his power with 
impunity. Imagine where that leads. 
The President can abuse his power with 
impunity. 
That argument made by Professor 
Dershowitz is at odds with the Attor-
ney General’s own expressed opinion on 
the subject, with Ken Starr’s expressed 
opinion on the subject, and with other 
counsel for the President. Jonathan 
Turley, who testified in the House, said 
that theory is constitutionally, effec-
tively, nonsense. Even 60-year-old Alan 
Dershowitz doesn’t agree with 81-year- 
old Alan Dershowitz and for a reason— 
because where that conclusion leads us 
is that a President can abuse his power 
in any kind of way, and there is noth-
ing you can do about it. 
Are we really ready to accept the po-
sition that this President or the next 
can withhold hundreds of millions of 
dollars of military aid to an ally at war 
unless he gets help in his reelection? 
Would you say that you could, as 
President, withhold disaster relief from 
a Governor unless that Governor got 
his Attorney General to investigate the 
President’s political rival? 
That, to me, is the most dangerous 
argument of all. It is a danger to have 
a President engage in this conduct, and 
it is dangerous to have a trial with no 
witnesses and set that precedent. The 
biggest danger of all would be to accept 
the idea that a President could abuse 
his office in this way and that the Con-
gress is powerless to do anything about 
it. That is certainly not what the 
Founders intended. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I send a question to the desk on 
my behalf. I am also joined by Senators 
LOEFFLER, CRAMER, LEE, and MCSALLY. 
The 
CHIEF 
JUSTICE. 
Senators 
BLACKBURN, LOEFFLER, CRAMER, LEE, 
and MCSALLY ask of counsel for the 
President: 
Is the standard for impeachment in the 
House a lower threshold to meet than the 
standard for conviction in the Senate, and 
have the House managers met their evi-
dentiary burden to support a vote of re-
moval? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, as for the standard in 
the House, of course, the House is not 
making a final determination. In the 
structure of the Constitution, an im-
peachment is simply an accusation, 
and as in most systems where there is 
simply an accusation being made, the 
House does not have to adhere to the 
same standard that is used in the Sen-
ate. 
In most instances, House Members 
have suggested in debates on articles—

the view of the Members voting on it 
that there was some impeachable of-
fense, and that is all—some, not even 
that standard. So there is simply 
enough evidence that an accusation 
can be made. It is definitely a lower 
standard than the standard that has to 
be met here in a trial for an ultimate 
verdict. 
The Constitution speaks in terms of 
a conviction in the Senate. As both 
Professor Dershowitz and Judge Starr 
pointed out in their comments, every-
where in the Constitution in which 
there is any mention of impeachment, 
it is spoken of in terms of the criminal 
law. The offenses that define the juris-
diction for the Senate in its sitting as 
a Court of Impeachment are treason, 
bribery, and high crimes and mis-
demeanors. The Constitution speaks of 
a conviction, upon being convicted in 
the Senate. It speaks of all crimes 
being tried by a jury except in cases of 
impeachment—again, 
suggesting 
no-
tions of the criminal law. 
As we pointed out in our trial memo-
randum, all of these textual references 
make it clear that the standards of the 
criminal law should apply in the trial, 
certainly to the extent of the burden 
and standard of proof to be carried by 
the House managers, which means 
proof beyond a reasonable doubt. It is 
very clear that there is not any re-
quirement for proof beyond a reason-
able doubt simply for the House to vote 
upon Articles of Impeachment. 
There is a very much higher standard 
at stake here. As we pointed out in our 
trial memorandum, the mere accusa-
tion made by the House comes here 
with no presumption of regularity at 
all in its favor. The Senate sits as a 
trier of both fact and law, reviewing 
both factual and legal issues de novo, 
and the House managers are held to a 
standard of proving proof beyond a rea-
sonable doubt of every element of what 
would be a recognizable impeachable 
offense. 
Here they have failed in their burden 
of proof. They have also failed in the 
law. They have not stated in the Arti-
cles of Impeachment anything that on 
its face amounts to an impeachable of-
fense. On that fact, I think we have 
demonstrated very clearly that they 
have not presented facts that would 
amount to an impeachable offense even 
under their own theories. They have 
presented only part of the facts and 
left out the key facts. Mr. Purpura, I 
think, went through, very effectively, 
showing that there are some facts that 
don’t change. 
The transcript of the July 25 call 
shows the President doing nothing 
wrong. President Zelensky said he 
never felt any pressure. His other ad-
visers have said the Ukrainians never 
felt any pressure. They didn’t think 
there was any quid pro quo. They 
didn’t even know that the military as-
sistance had been held up until the PO-
LITICO article at the end of August. 
The only two people with statements 
on record who spoke to the President, 
Gordon Sondland and Senator RON 
JOHNSON, report that the President said 
to them there was no quid pro quo, and 
the aid flowed without anything ever 
being done related to investigations. 
That is what is in the record. That is 
what the House managers have to rely 
on to make their case, and they have 
failed to prove their case beyond a rea-
sonable doubt, failed even to prove it 
by clear and convincing evidence— 
failed to prove it at all, in my opinion. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from California is recog-
nized. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator FEIN-
STEIN asks the House managers: 
The President’s counsel stated that ‘‘there 
is simply no evidence anywhere that Presi-
dent Trump ever linked security assistance 
to any investigations’’—is that true? 
Mr. Manager CROW. Thank you, Mr. 
Chief Justice, and thank you, Senator, 
for that question. 
President’s counsel is not correct. 
There is, in fact, overwhelming evi-
dence that the President withheld the 
military aid directly to get a personal 
political benefit to help his individual 
political campaign. 
There are a few points that I would 
like to submit for your consideration. 
First, look no further than the words 
of the President’s Acting Chief of Staff, 
Mick Mulvaney, who, on October 17, 
2019, during a national press conference 
mentioned—or he was asked about the 
direct connection between the aid, and 
he said ‘‘Did he’’—meaning President 
Trump, referring to ‘‘he’’—‘‘also men-
tion to me in passing the corruption re-
lated to the DNC server? Absolutely— 
no question about that. That’s it, and 
that’s why we held up the money.’’ 
He was repeating the President’s own 
explanation relayed directly to him. 
Second, Gordon Sondland testified he 
spoke by phone with President Trump 
on September 7. The President denied 
there was a ‘‘quid pro quo,’’ but then 
outlined the very quid pro quo that he 
wanted from Ukraine. 
Then he told Ambassador Sondland 
that President Zelensky should ‘‘go to 
a microphone and announce the inves-
tigations . . . he should want to do 
[it].’’ 
Third, the President’s own advisers, 
including the Vice President and Sec-
retary Pompeo, were also aware of the 
direct connection. In Warsaw, on Sep-
tember 1, Ambassador Sondland told 
Vice President PENCE that he was con-
cerned the delay in security assistance 
had become ‘‘tied to the issue of inves-
tigations.’’ The Vice President simply 
nodded, tacitly acknowledging the con-
ditionality of the aid. 
Fourth, we heard from Ambassador 
Taylor, who, in direct emails and texts, 
said it was crazy to tie the security as-
sistance to the investigations. 
Five, we also know there is no other 
reason. The entire apparatus and struc-
ture of the Defense Department, the 
State Department that should have 
been dealing with the other legitimate 
reasons—you know, the policy debate 
that the President’s counsel wants you 
to believe that this was about—they 
were all kept in the dark. 
And the supposed interagency proc-
ess that they made up several months 
after the fact had ended months before, 
during the last interagency meetings. 
Now I will make one final point. 
Again, if you have any lingering ques-
tions 
about 
direct 
evidence, 
any 
thoughts 
about 
anything 
we 
just 
talked about, anything I have just re-
layed or that we have talked about the 
last week, there is a way to shed addi-
tional light on it: You can subpoena 
Ambassador Bolton and ask him that 
question directly. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. Chief Justice, I send a 
question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators LEE 
and CRUZ ask of counsel for the Presi-
dent: 
The House managers have argued aggres-
sively that the President’s actions con-
travened U.S. foreign policy. Isn’t it the 
President’s place—certainly more than the 
place for career civil servants—to conduct 
foreign policy? 
Mr. Manager PHILBIN. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, and thank 
you for that question. 
It is definitely the President’s place 
to set U.S. foreign policy, and the Con-
stitution makes this clear. Article II, 
section 1 vests the entirety of the exec-
utive authority in a President of the 
United States, and it is critically im-
portant in our constitutional structure 
that that authority is vested solely in 
the President because the President is 
elected by the people every 4 years. 
That is what gives the President demo-
cratic legitimacy to have the powers 
that he is given under the Constitu-
tion. 
Our system is somewhat unique in 
the very broad powers that are as-
signed to the Executive, but it works, 
and it makes sense in a democratic sys-
tem precisely because he is directly ac-
countable to the people for the policies 
that he sets. 
Those who are staffers in the execu-
tive branch bureaucracy are not elect-
ed by the people. They have no ac-
countability, and they have no legit-
imacy or authority that comes from an 
election by the people, and so it is 
critically important to recognize the 
President sets foreign policy. 
Of course, within some constraints, 
there are some roles for Congress in 
foreign affairs. To some extent, stat-
utes can be passed, funding provisions 
can be passed that relate to it, but the 
Supreme Court has recognized time 
and again that the President is, as the 
Court said in Curtiss-Wright, the ‘‘sole 
organ of the nation’’ in foreign affairs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S649 
January 29, 2020 
So he sets foreign policy, and if staff-
ers disagree with him, that does not 
mean that the President is doing some-
thing wrong, and this is a critical point 
because this is one of the centerpieces 
of the abuse of power theory that the 
House managers would like this body 
to adopt, and that is that they are 
going to impeach the President based 
solely on his subjective motive. 
The premise of their case is the ob-
jective actions that were taken were 
perfectly permissible and within the 
President’s constitutional authority, 
but if his real reason—if we get inside 
his head and figure it out—then we can 
impeach him. And the way that they 
have tried to explain that they can 
prove that the President had a bad mo-
tive is they say: Well, we compare what 
did the President want to do with what 
the interagency consensus was. 
And I mentioned this the other day. 
They say that the President defied and 
confounded every agency in the execu-
tive branch. That is a constitutionally 
incoherent statement. The President 
cannot defy the agencies within the ex-
ecutive branch that are subordinate to 
him. It is only they who can defy the 
President’s determinations of policy. 
And so what this all boils down to is 
it shows that this case is built upon a 
policy difference and a policy dif-
ference where the President is the one 
who gets to determine policy because 
he has been elected by the people to do 
that. 
And we are right now only a few 
months away from another election 
where the people can decide for them-
selves whether they like what the 
President has done with that authority 
or not, and that is the way disputes 
about policy like that should be re-
solved. 
It is not legitimate to say that there 
is some interagency consensus that dis-
agrees with the President, and there-
fore we can show he did something 
wrong, and therefore he can be im-
peached. That is an extraordinarily 
dangerous proposition because it lacks 
any democratic legitimacy whatsoever. 
It is contrary to the Constitution, and 
it should be rejected by this body. 
The President is the one who gets to 
set foreign policy because that is the 
role assigned to him in the Constitu-
tion. 
And it was even Lieutenant Colonel 
Vindman, who had complained about 
the July 25 call, himself ultimately 
agreed that it was only a policy dif-
ference; it was a policy concern that he 
raised about the call. That is not 
enough to impeach a President of the 
United States. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator SHA-
HEEN asks the House managers: 
The President’s counsel has argued that 
the alleged conduct set out in the articles 
does not violate a criminal statute and thus 
may not constitute grounds for impeach-
ment as ‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ 
Does this reasoning imply that if the Presi-
dent does not violate a criminal statute he 
could not be impeached for abuses of power 
such as ordering tax audits of political oppo-
nents, suspending habeas corpus rights, in-
discriminately investigating political oppo-
nents or asking foreign powers to investigate 
Members of Congress? 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. 
Chief Justice, Senators, I appreciate 
the question. 
The simple answer is that a Presi-
dent can be impeached without a statu-
tory crime being committed. That was 
the position and the question that was 
rejected in President Nixon’s case and 
rejected again in President Clinton’s 
case. It should be rejected here in 
President Trump’s case. 
The great preponderance of legal au-
thority confirms that impeachable of-
fenses—of 
legal 
authority 
confirms 
that it is not defined in criminal con-
duct. This authority includes nearly 
every legal scholar who has studied the 
issue, multiple Supreme Court Justices 
who addressed it in public remarks, 
and prior impeachments in the House. 
This conclusion follows that con-
stitutional history, text, and structure 
and reflects the absurdities and prac-
tical difficulties that would result were 
the impeachment power confined to in-
dictable crimes. 
As slide 35 shows, first, the plain text 
of the Constitution does not require 
that an offense be a crime in order for 
it to be impeachable. 
Alexander Hamilton explained that 
impeachable offenses, high crimes, and 
misdemeanors are defined fundamen-
tally by the abuse or violation of some 
public trust—some public trust. They 
are political as they relate chiefly to 
injuries done immediately to society 
itself. 
Offenses against the Constitution are 
different than offenses against the 
Criminal Code. Some crimes, like jay-
walking, are not impeachable, and 
some forms of misconduct often both 
offend the Constitution and the crimi-
nal law. 
Impeachment and criminality must, 
therefore, be assessed separately, even 
though the President’s commission of 
indictable crimes may further support 
a case of impeachment and removal. 
The American experience with im-
peachment confirms this. A strong ma-
jority of impeachments voted by the 
House since 1789 have included one or 
more allegations that did not charge a 
violation of criminal law. 
Although President Nixon resigned 
before the House could consider the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment against him, the 
Judiciary Committee’s allegations en-
compassed many, many noncriminal 
acts. 
And in President Clinton’s case, the 
Judiciary Committee report accom-
panying the Articles of Impeachment 
to the House floor stated that ‘‘the ac-
tions of President Clinton do not have 
to rise to the level of violating the Fed-
eral statute regarding obstruction of 
justice in order to justify impeach-
ment. . . . The Framers intended im-
peachment to reach the full spectrum 
of Presidential misconduct that threat-
ened the Constitution. They also in-
tended that our Constitution endure 
throughout the ages.’’ 
In other words, if it named one, two, 
and three, but new ones came up and 
you had to keep up with the times, it 
was better to have the full spectrum of 
Presidential misconduct. Because it 
could not anticipate and specifically 
prohibit every single threat a Presi-
dent might someday pose, the Framers 
adopted a standard sufficiently general 
and flexible to meet unknown future 
circumstances. 
This 
standard 
was 
meant, as Mason put it, to capture ‘‘all 
manner 
of 
great 
and 
dangerous 
offences,’’ and compatible with the 
Constitution. 
When the President uses the powers 
of his high office to benefit himself 
while injuring or ignoring the very peo-
ple he is duty-bound to serve, he has 
committed an impeachable offense. 
The records of the Constitutional 
Convention offer further clarity. At the 
Constitutional Convention itself, no 
delegate—no delegate—linked impeach-
ment to the technicalities of criminal 
law. Instead, the Framers principally 
intended impeachment for three forms 
of Presidential wrongdoing, the ABCs 
of impeachment: A, abuse of power; B, 
betrayal 
of 
the 
national 
interests 
through foreign entanglements; and C, 
corruption of office and elections. 
When the President uses his power to 
obtain illicit help in his election from 
a foreign power, it undermines our na-
tional security and election integrity. 
It is a trifecta. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chief Justice, 
along with Senator BLACKBURN
and 
Senator CORNYN, I send a question to 
the desk for the House managers and 
for counsel to the President. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. In the case of 
such a question, addressed to both 
sides, they will split the 5 minutes 
equally. 
The Senators ask: 
Why did the House of Representatives not 
challenge President Trump’s claims of exec-
utive privilege and/or immunity during the 
House impeachment proceedings? 
We will begin with the House man-
agers. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, distinguished Senators, thank 
you for your question. The answer is 
simple. We did not challenge any 
claims related to executive privilege 
because, as the President’s own counsel 
admitted during this trial, the Presi-
dent never raised the question of exec-
utive privilege. 
What the President did raise was this 
notion of blanket defiance, this notion 
that the executive branch, directed by 
the President, could completely defy 
any and all subpoenas issued by the

House of Representatives, not turn 
over documents, not turn over wit-
nesses, not produce a single shred of in-
formation in order to allow us to 
present the truth to the American peo-
ple. 
In the October 8 letter that was sent 
to the House of Representatives, there 
was no jurisprudence that was cited to 
justify the notion of blanket defiance. 
There has been no case law cited to jus-
tify the doctrine of absolute immunity. 
In fact, every single court that has 
considered any Presidential claims of 
absolute immunity such as the one as-
serted by the White House has rejected 
it out of hand. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Counsel for the 
President. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
Let me frame this partly in response 
to what Manager JEFFRIES said, and I 
went through this before. The idea that 
there was blanket defiance and no ex-
planation and no case law from the 
White House is simply incorrect. I put 
up slides showing the letter—the letter 
from October 18 that explains specifi-
cally that the subpoenas that had been 
issued by the House, because they were 
not authorized by a vote from the 
House, were invalid. And there was a 
letter from the White House counsel 
saying that. There was a letter from 
OMB saying that. There was a letter 
from the State Department saying 
that. There was specific rationale 
given, citing cases—Watkins, Rumely, 
and others—explaining that defect. The 
House managers—the House, Manager 
SCHIFF—chose not to take any steps to 
correct that. 
We also pointed out other defects. 
We asserted the doctrine of absolute 
immunity for senior advisers to the 
President, which has been asserted by 
every President since the 1970s. They 
chose not to challenge that in court. 
We also explained the problem that 
they didn’t allow agency counsel to be 
present at depositions. They chose not 
to challenge that in court. 
These are specific legal reasons, not 
blanket defiance. That is a misrepre-
sentation of the record. And there was 
no attempt to have that adjudicated in 
court. The reason there was no attempt 
is that the House Democrats were just 
in a hurry. They had a timetable. One 
of the House managers said on the floor 
here—they had no time for courts. 
They had to impeach the President be-
fore the election, so they had to have 
that done by Christmas. That is why 
the proper process wasn’t followed 
here, because it was a partisan and po-
litical impeachment that they wanted 
to get done all around timing for the 
election. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chief Justice, I have 
a question for the House managers, and 
I send it to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator LEAHY 
asks the House managers: 
The President’s counsel argues that there 
was no harm done, that the aid was ulti-
mately released to Ukraine, the President 
met with Zelensky at the U.N. in September, 
and that this President has treated Ukraine 
more favorably than his predecessors. What 
is your response? 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Senators, thank you so much 
for your question. 
Contrary to what the White House 
counsel has said or has claimed—that 
there was no harm, no foul; that the 
aid eventually got there—we promised 
Ukraine in 2014 that if they gave up 
their nuclear arsenal, that we would be 
there for them, that we would defend 
them, that we would fight along beside 
them. 
Fifteen thousand Ukrainians have 
died. It was interesting the other day 
when the White House counsel said 
that no American life was lost, and we 
are always grateful and thankful for 
that. But what about our friends? What 
about our allies in Ukraine? According 
to Diplomat Holmes and Ambassador 
Taylor, our Ukrainian friends continue 
to die on the frontlines, those who are 
fighting for us, fighting Russian ag-
gression. When the Ukrainians have 
the ability to defend themselves, they 
have the ability to defend us. 
The aid, although it did arrive, took 
the work of some Senators in this room 
who had to pass additional laws to 
make sure that the Ukrainians did not 
lose out on 35 million additional dol-
lars. 
Contrary to the President’s tweet 
that all of the aid arrived and that it 
arrived ahead of schedule—that is not 
true. All of the aid had not arrived. 
Let’s talk about what kind of signal 
is sent, withholding the aid for no le-
gitimate reason. The President talked 
about burden-sharing, but nothing had 
changed on the ground. Holding the aid 
for no legitimate reason sent a strong 
message that we would not want to 
send to Russia—that the relationship 
between the United States and Ukraine 
was on shaky ground. It actually un-
dercut Ukraine’s ability to negotiate 
with Russia, with which, as everybody 
in this room knows, it is in an active 
war, in a hot war. 
So when we talk about ‘‘The aid 
eventually got there; no harm, no 
foul,’’ that is not true, Senators, and I 
know that you know that. There was 
harm and there was foul. And let us not 
forget that Ukraine is not an enemy. 
They are not an adversary. They are a 
friend. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator CRUZ? 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. Chief Justice, I send a 
question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is 
addressed to counsel for the President: 
As a matter of law, does it matter if there 
was a quid pro quo? Is it true that quid pro 
quos are often used in foreign policy? 
Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief 
Justice, thank you very much for your 
question. 
Yesterday, I had the privilege of at-
tending the rolling-out of a peace plan 
by the President of the United States 
regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, 
and I offered you a hypothetical the 
other day: What if a Democratic Presi-
dent were to be elected and Congress 
were to authorize much money to ei-
ther Israel or the Palestinians and the 
Democratic President were to say to 
Israel ‘‘No; I am going to withhold this 
money unless you stop all settlement 
growth’’ or to the Palestinians ‘‘I will 
withhold the money Congress author-
ized to you unless you stop paying ter-
rorists, and the President said ‘‘Quid 
pro quo. If you don’t do it, you don’t 
get the money. If you do it, you get the 
money’’? There is no one in this Cham-
ber who would regard that as in any 
way unlawful. The only thing that 
would make a quid pro quo unlawful is 
if the quo were in some way illegal. 
Now, we talked about motive. There 
are three possible motives that a polit-
ical figure can have: One, a motive in 
the public interest, and the Israel argu-
ment would be in the public interest; 
the second is in his own political inter-
est; and the third, which hasn’t been 
mentioned, would be in his own finan-
cial interest, his own pure financial in-
terest, just putting money in the bank. 
I want to focus on the second one for 
just one moment. 
Every public official whom I know 
believes that his election is in the pub-
lic interest. Mostly, you are right. 
Your election is in the public interest. 
If a President does something which he 
believes will help him get elected—in 
the public interest—that cannot be the 
kind of quid pro quo that results in im-
peachment. 
I quoted President Lincoln, when 
President Lincoln told General Sher-
man to let the troops go to Indiana so 
that they could vote for the Republican 
Party. Let’s assume the President was 
running at that point and it was in his 
electoral interests to have these sol-
diers put at risk the lives of many, 
many other soldiers who would be left 
without their company. Would that be 
an unlawful quid pro quo? No, because 
the President, A, believed it was in the 
national interest, but B, he believed 
that his own election was essential to 
victory in the Civil War. Every Presi-
dent believes that. That is why it is so 
dangerous to try to psychoanalyze the 
President, to try to get into the intri-
cacies of the human mind. 
Everybody has mixed motives, and 
for there to be a constitutional im-
peachment based on mixed motives 
would permit almost any President to 
be impeached. 
How many Presidents have made for-
eign policy decisions after checking 
with their political advisers and their 
pollsters? If you are just acting in the 
national interest, why do you need 
pollsters? Why do you need political 
advisers? Just do what is best for the 
country. But if you want to balance 
what is in the public interest with 
what is in your party’s electoral inter-
est and your own electoral interest, it

is impossible to discern how much 
weight is given to one or the other. 
Now, we may argue that it is not in 
the national interest for a particular 
President to get reelected or for a par-
ticular Senator or Member of Con-
gress—and maybe we are right; it is 
not in the national interest for every-
body who is running to be elected—but 
for it to be impeachable, you would 
have to discern that he or she made a 
decision solely on the basis of, as the 
House managers put it, corrupt mo-
tives, and it cannot be a corrupt mo-
tive if you have a mixed motive that 
partially involves the national inter-
est, partially involves electoral, and 
does not involve personal pecuniary in-
terest. 
The House managers do not allege 
that this decision, this quid pro quo, as 
they call it—and the question is based 
on the hypothesis there was a quid pro 
quo. I am not attacking the facts. They 
never allege that it was based on pure 
financial reasons. It would be a much 
harder case. 
If a hypothetical President of the 
United States said to a hypothetical 
leader of a foreign country: Unless you 
build a hotel with my name on it and 
unless you give me a million-dollar 
kickback, I will withhold the funds. 
That is an easy case. That is purely 
corrupt and in the purely private inter-
est. 
But a complex middle case is: I want 
to be elected. I think I am a great 
President. I think I am the greatest 
President there ever was, and if I am 
not elected, the national interest will 
suffer greatly. That cannot be. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. DERSHOWITZ. Thank you, Mr. 
Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. I recognize the 
democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator SCHU-
MER’s question is for the House man-
agers: 
Would you please respond to the answer 
that was just given by the President’s coun-
sel? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I would be de-
lighted. There are two arguments that 
Professor Dershowitz makes: one that 
is, I have to say, a very odd argument 
for a criminal defense lawyer to make, 
and that is, it is highly unusual to have 
a discussion in trial about the defend-
ant’s state of mind, intent, or mens 
rea. 
In every courtroom in America, in 
every criminal case—or almost every 
criminal case, except for a very small 
sliver where there is strict liability— 
the question of the defendant’s intent 
and state of mind is always an issue. 
This is nothing novel here. You don’t 
require a mind reader. In every crimi-
nal case—and I would assume in every 
impeachment case—yes, you have to 
show that the President was operating 
from a corrupt motive, and we have. 
But he also makes an argument that 
all quid pro quos are the same and all 
are perfectly copacetic. Now, some of 
you said earlier: Well, if they could 
prove a quid pro quo over the military, 
now that would be something. Well, we 
have. So now the argument shifts to all 
quid pro quos are just fine, and they 
are all the same. 
Well, I am going to apply Professor 
Dershowitz’s own test. He talked about 
the step test, John Rawls, the philoso-
pher—let’s put the shoe on the other 
foot and see how that changes our per-
ception of the case. I want to merge 
that argument with one of the other 
Presidential counsel’s argument when 
they resorted to the whataboutism 
about Barack Obama’s open mic. 
Now, that was a very poor analogy, I 
think you will agree, but let’s use that 
analogy and let’s make it more com-
parable to today and see how you feel 
about this scenario. 
President Obama, on an open mic, 
said to Medvedev: Hey, Medvedev, I 
know you don’t want me to send this 
military money to Ukraine because 
they are fighting and killing your peo-
ple. I want you to do me a favor, 
though. I want you to do an investiga-
tion of MITT ROMNEY, and I want you 
to announce you found dirt on MITT 
ROMNEY, and if you are willing to do 
that, quid pro quo, I will not give 
Ukraine the money they need to fight 
you on the frontline. 
Do any of us have any question that 
Barack Obama would be impeached for 
that kind of misconduct? Are we really 
ready to say that would be OK, that 
Barack Obama asked Medvedev to in-
vestigate his opponent and would with-
hold money from an ally that needed to 
defend itself to get an investigation of 
MITT ROMNEY? 
That is the parallel here. And to say, 
well, yes, we condition aid all the 
time—for legitimate reasons, yes. For 
legitimate reasons, you might say to a 
Governor of a State: Hey, Governor of 
the State, you should chip in more to-
ward your own disaster relief. But if 
the President’s real motive in depriv-
ing the State of disaster relief is be-
cause that Governor will not get his at-
torney general to investigate the Presi-
dent’s political rival, are we ready to 
say that the President can sacrifice the 
interest of the people of that State or, 
in the case of Medvedev, the people of 
our country because all quid pro quos 
are fine? It is carte blanche? Is that 
really what we are prepared to say 
with respect to this President’s mis-
conduct or the next? 
Because if we are, then the next 
President of the United States can ask 
for an investigation of you. They can 
ask for help in their next election from 
any foreign power, and the argument 
will be made: No, Donald Trump was 
acquitted for doing exactly the same 
thing; therefore, it must not be im-
peachable. 
Now, bear in mind that efforts to 
cheat an election are always going to 
be in proximity to an election. And if 
you say you can’t hold a President ac-
countable in an election year, where 
they are trying to cheat in that elec-
tion, then you are giving them carte 
blanche. 
So all quid pros are not the same. 
Some are legitimate and some are cor-
rupt, and you don’t need to be a mind 
reader to figure out which is which. 
For one thing, you can ask John 
Bolton. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I send a question to 
the desk. 
The 
CHIEF 
JUSTICE. 
Senator 
GRASSLEY asks counsel for the Presi-
dent: 
Does the House’s failure to enforce its sub-
poenas render its ‘‘obstruction of Congress’’ 
theory unprecedented? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, the answer is yes. As far 
as I am aware, there has never been a 
prior instance in which there has been 
an attempt, even in the House, as in 
the Nixon proceeding—never mind in 
the Clinton proceeding, which actually 
left the House and came to the Sen-
ate—to suggest that there can be ob-
struction 
of 
Congress 
when 
there 
hasn’t been anything beyond simply 
issuing a subpoena, getting resistance, 
and then throwing up your hands and 
giving up and saying: Oh, well, that is 
obstruction. 
In the Clinton situation, most of the 
litigation was with independent coun-
sel, and there were privileges asserted 
in litigation and litigation again and 
again, but the point is that the issues 
about the privileges were all litigated, 
and they were resolved before things 
came to this body. 
Similarly, in the Nixon impeachment 
proceeding within the House, a lot of 
investigation had been done by the spe-
cial counsel, and there was litigation 
over assertions of privileges there in 
order to get the tapes, and some tapes 
and 
transcripts 
had 
already 
been 
turned over, but, again, there was liti-
gation about the assertion of the privi-
lege in response to the grand jury sub-
poena that then fed into the House’s 
proceedings. 
So it would be completely unprece-
dented for the House to attempt to ac-
tually bring a charge of obstruction 
into the Senate where all they can 
present is: Well, we issued a subpoena, 
and there were legal grounds asserted 
for the invalidity of the subpoena, and 
there were different grounds, as I have 
gone through. I will not repeat them 
all in detail here. 
Some of those subpoenas were just 
invalid when issued because there was 
no vote. Some of the subpoenas for wit-
nesses were invalid because senior ad-
visers to the President had absolute 
immunity from compulsion. Some were 
that 
they 
were 
forcing 
executive 
branch officials to testify without the 
benefit of agency counsel and executive 
branch counsel with them. So there 
were various reasons asserted for the

invalidity and the defects in various 
subpoenas and then no attempt to en-
force them, no attempt to litigate out 
what the validity or invalidity might 
be but to just bring it here as an ob-
struction charge is unprecedented. 
I will note that House managers have 
said—and I am sure that they will say 
again today—that, well, but if we had 
gone to court, the Trump administra-
tion would have said that the courts 
don’t have jurisdiction over those 
claims. Now, that is true. In some 
cases—there is one being litigated 
right now related to the former Coun-
sel for the President, Don McGahn. The 
Trump administration’s position, just 
like the position of the Obama admin-
istration, is that an effort by the House 
to enforce a subpoena in an article III 
court is a nonjusticiable controversy. 
That is our position, and we would 
argue that in court. 
But that is part of what would have 
to be litigated. That doesn’t change the 
fact that the House managers can’t 
have it both ways. I want to make this 
clear. The House managers want to say 
that they have an avenue for going to 
court; they are using that avenue for 
going to court; and they actually told 
the court in McGahn that once they 
reached an impasse with the executive 
branch, the courts were the only way 
to resolve the impasse. 
As I explained the other day, there 
are mechanisms for dealing with these 
disputes between the executive and 
Congress. First is an accommodations 
process. They didn’t do that. We of-
fered to do that in the White House 
Counsel’s October 8 letter. They didn’t 
do accommodations. If they think they 
can sue, they have to take that step be-
cause the Constitution, the courts have 
made clear, requires incrementalism in 
disputes between the executive and the 
legislative branch. 
So if they think that the courts can 
resolve that dispute, that is the next 
step. They should do that and have 
that litigated, and then things can pro-
ceed on to a higher level of confronta-
tion. But to jump straight to impeach-
ment, to the ultimate constitutional 
confrontation, doesn’t make sense. It is 
not the system that the Constitution 
requires, and it is unprecedented in 
this case. Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. 
Chief Justice. I send a question to the 
desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator STA-
BENOW asks the House managers: 
Would the House Managers care to correct 
the 
record 
on 
any 
falsehoods 
or 
mischaracterizations in the White House’s 
opening arguments? 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, thank you for 
that question. We believe that the 
President’s team has claimed basically 
there were six facts that have not been 
met and will not change and all six of 
those so-called facts are incorrect. 
Let’s be clear. On July 25—that is not 
the whole evidence before us, even 
though it includes devastating evi-
dence, the President’s scheme. Presi-
dent Trump’s intent was made clear on 
the July 25 call, but we had evidence of 
information before the meeting with 
Mr. Bolton, the text message to Mr. 
Zelensky’s people telling him he had to 
do the investigations to get what he 
wanted. All of this evidence makes us 
understand that phone call even more 
clearly. 
Now, the President’s team claimed 
that Mr. Zelensky and other Ukrain-
ians said they never felt pressured over 
investigations. Now, of course, they 
didn’t say that publicly. They were 
afraid of the Russians finding out. But 
Zelensky said privately that he didn’t 
want to be involved in U.S. domestic 
politics. He resisted announcing the in-
vestigations. He only relented and 
scheduled the CNN meeting after it be-
came clear that he was not going to re-
ceive the support that he needed and 
that Congress had provided in our ap-
propriations. That is the definition of 
‘‘pressure.’’ 
Now, Ukraine—the President’s law-
yers say—didn’t know that Trump was 
withholding the security assistance 
until it was public. Many witnesses 
have contested that, including the open 
statement by Olena Zerkal, who was 
then the Deputy Foreign Minister of 
Ukraine, that they knew about the 
President’s hold on security matters, 
and in the end, everyone knew, it was 
public, and afterward, Ukraine did re-
lent and scheduled that testimony. 
Fourth, they said no witnesses, said 
security was conditioned on the inves-
tigations. Not so. There was Mulvaney, 
and we had other witnesses talking 
about the shakedown for the security 
assistance. But the important thing is, 
you can get a witness who talked to 
the President firsthand about what the 
President thought he was doing. 
Ultimately, of course, the funds—or 
at least some of them—were released, 
but the White House meeting that the 
President 
promised 
three 
different 
times still has not occurred, and we 
still don’t have the investigation of the 
Bidens. 
Getting caught doesn’t mitigate the 
wrongdoing. The President is unrepent-
ant, and we fear he will do it again. 
The independent Government Ac-
countability Office concluded that the 
President violated Federal law when he 
withheld that aid. That misconduct is 
still going on. All the aid has not yet 
been released. 
Finally, I would just like to say that 
there has been some confusion, I think. 
I am sure it is not intentional. But the 
President surely does not need the per-
mission of his staff about foreign pol-
icy. That information is offered to you 
as evidence of what he thought he was 
doing. He did not appear to be pursuing 
a policy agenda. From all of the evi-
dence, he appeared to be pursuing a 
corruption—a corruption of our elec-
tion that is upcoming; a high crime 
and misdemeanor that requires convic-
tion and removal. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. I send a question to the 
desk for the President’s counsel on be-
half of myself and Senators BOOZMAN, 
MCSALLY, BLACKBURN, KENNEDY, and 
TOOMEY. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senators 
ask the President’s counsel: 
Did the House bother to seek testimony or 
litigate executive privilege issues during the 
month during which it held up the impeach-
ment articles before sending them to the 
Senate? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, no, the House did not 
seek to litigate any of the privilege 
issues during that time. In fact, they 
filed no lawsuits arising from this im-
peachment inquiry to seek to contest 
the bases that the Trump administra-
tion gave for resisting the subpoenas, 
the bases for why those subpoenas were 
invalid. 
When litigation was filed by one of 
the subpoena recipients—that was Dr. 
Charles Kupperman, the Deputy Na-
tional Security Advisor—he went to 
the court and sought a declaratory 
judgment, saying: The President has 
told me I shouldn’t go. I have a sub-
poena from the House saying I should 
go. Please, courts, tell me what my ob-
ligations are. 
I believe that was filed around Octo-
ber 25. It was toward the end of Octo-
ber. 
Very shortly, within a few days, the 
court had set an expedited briefing 
schedule and scheduled the hearing for 
December 10. They were supposed to 
hear both preliminary motions to dis-
miss and also the merits issue. 
So they were going to get a decision 
after a hearing on December 10 that 
would go to the merits of the issue, but 
the House managers withdrew the sub-
poena. The House of Representatives 
decided they wanted to moot out the 
case so they wouldn’t get a decision. 
So, no, the House has not pursued 
litigation to get any of these issues re-
solved. It has affirmatively avoided 
getting into any litigation. That seems 
to be at least in part based on—if you 
look at the House Judiciary Committee 
report—their assertion that under the 
sole power of impeachment assigned to 
the House, the House believes that the 
Constitution 
assigns—I 
believe 
the 
exact words are that it gives the House 
the last word, something to that effect. 
I mentioned this the other day. This 
is the new constitutional theory that 
because they have the sole power of im-
peachment, in their view, it is actually 
the paramount power of impeachment 
and that all other constitutionally 
based privileges or rights or immuni-
ties or roles, even, of the other 
branches—both the judiciary and the 
executive—fall away, and there is noth-
ing that can stand in the way of the

House’s power of impeachment. If they 
issue a subpoena, the executive has to 
respond, and it can’t raise any con-
stitutionally based separation of pow-
ers concerns. If you do, that is obstruc-
tion of the courts. The courts have no 
role. The House has the sole power of 
impeachment. 
That is a very dangerous construct 
for our Constitution. It suggests that 
once they flip the switch on to im-
peachment, there is no check on their 
power and what they want to do. That 
is not the way the Constitution is 
structured. When there are interbranch 
conflicts, the Constitution requires 
that there be an accommodation proc-
ess, that there be attempts to address 
the interests of both branches. 
The House has taken the position— 
and in other litigation—the McGahn 
litigation—they are telling the courts 
that the courts are the only way to re-
solve these issues. They brought that 
case in August. They already have a 
decision from the district court. They 
have an appeal in the DC Circuit. It 
was argued on January 3. A decision 
could come any day. That is pretty fast 
for litigation. But in this impeach-
ment, they have decided that they 
don’t want to do litigation. Again, it is 
because they had a timetable. One of 
the House managers admitted it on 
this floor. They had to get the Presi-
dent impeached before the election. 
They had no time for the courts, for 
anyone telling them what the rules 
were. They had to get it done by 
Christmas, and that is what they did. 
Then they waited around a month be-
fore bringing it here. 
I think that shows you what is really 
behind the claims of, oh, it is urgent, 
then it is not urgent. It was urgent 
when it was our timetable to get it 
done by Christmas. It is not so urgent 
when we can wait for a month because 
we want to tell the Senate how to run 
things. It is all a political charade. 
That is part of the reason—a major 
reason—that the Senate should reject 
these Articles of Impeachment. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from New Mexico. 
Mr. UDALL. Thank you for the rec-
ognition, Mr. Chief Justice. I send a 
question to the desk. 
The 
CHIEF 
JUSTICE. 
Senator 
UDALL’s question is for the House man-
agers: 
Please address the President’s counsel’s ar-
gument that House managers seek to over-
turn the results of the 2016 election and that 
the decision to remove the President should 
be left to the voters in November. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you for 
the question. 
First, I just want to respond to some-
thing counsel just said—that 9 months 
is pretty fast for litigation in the 
courts. Sadly, I agree with that. Nine 
months is pretty fast in the McGahn 
case, and we still don’t have a decision 
yet. What is more, that is the very case 
in which they are arguing, as I quoted 
earlier, that Congress has no right to 
come to the courts to force a witness 
to testify. So here we are 9 months 
later in that litigation that they said 
we are compelled under the Constitu-
tion to bring, and they are saying in 
court: You can’t bring this. And it is 9 
months, and we still don’t have a deci-
sion. I think that tells you just where 
they are coming from. It all goes back 
to the President’s directive to fight all 
subpoenas, and they are. 
Nixon was going to be impeached for 
far less obstruction than anything that 
Donald Trump did. 
The argument: Well, if you impeach a 
President, you are overturning the re-
sults of the last election and you are 
tearing up the ballots in the next elec-
tion. If that were the case, there would 
be no impeachment clause in the Con-
stitution because, by definition, if you 
are impeaching a President, that Presi-
dent is in office and has won an elec-
tion. 
Clearly, that is not what the Found-
ers had in mind. What they had in 
mind is, if the President commits high 
crimes and misdemeanors, you must 
remove him from office. It is not void-
ing the last election; it is protecting 
the next election. Indeed, the impeach-
ment power was put in the Constitu-
tion not as a punishment—that is what 
the criminal laws are for—but to pro-
tect the country. 
Now, if you say you can’t impeach a 
President before the next election, 
what you are really saying is you can 
only impeach a President in their sec-
ond term. If that were going to be the 
constitutional requirement, the Found-
ers would have put in the Constitution: 
A President may commit whatever 
high crimes and misdemeanors he 
wants as long as it is in the first term. 
That is clearly not what any rational 
Framer would have written, and, in-
deed, they didn’t, and they didn’t for a 
reason. The Founders were concerned 
that, in fact, the object of a President’s 
corrupt scheme might be to cheat in 
the very form of accountability that 
they have prescribed: the election. 
So 
counsel 
has 
continued 
to 
mischaracterize what the managers 
have said. We are not saying we had to 
hurry to impeach the President before 
the election. We had to hurry because 
the President was trying to cheat in 
that election. 
The position of the President’s coun-
sel is, well, yes, it is true that if a 
President is going to try to cheat an 
election, by definition, that is prior to 
their reelection; by definition, that is 
going to be proximate to an election; 
but, you know, let the voters decide, 
even though the object is to corrupt 
that vote of the people. That cannot be 
what the Founders had in mind. 
One of the things I said at the very 
opening of this proceeding is, yes, we 
are to look to history; yes, we are to 
try to define the intent of the Framers; 
but we are not to leave our common 
sense at the door. 
The issue isn’t whether it is his first 
term or his second. It isn’t whether the 
election is a year away or 3 years 
away. The issue is, did he commit a 
high crime and misdemeanor? Is it a 
high crime and misdemeanor for a 
President of the United States to with-
hold hundreds of millions of dollars in 
aid to an ally at war to get help, to 
elicit foreign interference in our elec-
tion? If you believe that it is, it doesn’t 
matter what term it is, it doesn’t mat-
ter how far away the election is be-
cause 
that 
President 
represents 
a 
threat to the integrity of our elections 
and, more than that, a threat to our 
national security. 
As we have shown, by withholding 
that aid—and I know the argument is, 
no harm, no foul—we withheld aid from 
an ally at war. We sent a message to 
the Russians, when they learned of this 
hold, that we did not have Ukraine’s 
back. We sent a message to the Rus-
sians, as Zelensky was going into nego-
tiations with Putin to try to end that 
war, that Zelensky was operating from 
a position of weakness because there 
was a division between the President of 
the United States and Ukraine. That is 
immediate damage. That is damage 
done every day. That damage continues 
to this day. 
The damage the President does in 
pushing out the Russian conspiracy 
theories were identified during the 
House proceedings—and you have heard 
it in the Senate—as Russian intel-
ligence propaganda. The danger the 
President poses by taking Vladimir 
Putin’s side over his own intelligence 
agencies—that is a danger today. That 
is a danger that continues every day he 
pushes out this Russian propaganda. 
If the Framers meant impeachment 
only to apply in the second term, they 
would have said so. But that would 
have made the Constitution a suicide 
pact. That is not what it says, and that 
is not how you should interpret it. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I send a question to 
the desk. 
The

JUSTICE. 
Senator 
PORTMAN’s question is directed to 
counsel for the President: 
Given that impeachment proceedings are 
privileged in the Senate and largely prevent 
other work from taking place while they are 
ongoing, please address the implications of 
allowing the House to present an incomplete 
case to the Senate and request the Senate to 
seek testimony from additional witnesses. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice, Senators. I think 
this is one of the most important 
issues that this body faces, given these 
calls to have witnesses, because the 
House managers tried to present it as 
if, oh, it is just a simple question; how 
can you have a trial without witnesses? 
But in real litigation, no one goes to 
trial without doing discovery. No one 
goes to trial without having heard

from the witnesses first. You don’t 
show up at trial and then start trying 
to call witnesses for the first time. 
The implications here in our con-
stitutional structure, trying to run 
things in such an upside-down way 
would be very grave for this body as an 
institution because, as the Senator’s 
question points out, it largely prevents 
this Chamber from getting other busi-
ness done as long as there is a trial 
pending. 
The idea that the House can do an in-
complete job in trying to find out what 
witnesses there are, having them come 
testify, trying to find out the facts— 
just rush something through and bring 
it here as an impeachment and then 
start trying to call all the witnesses— 
means that this body will end up tak-
ing over that investigatory task, and 
all the regular business of this body 
will be slowed down, hindered, pre-
vented while that goes on. 
And it is not a question of just one 
witness. A lot of people talk right now 
about John Bolton, but the President 
would have the opportunity to call his 
witnesses, just as a matter of funda-
mental fairness. There would be a long 
list of witnesses if the body were to go 
in that direction. It would mean this 
would drag on for months and prevent 
this Chamber from getting its business 
done. 
There is a proper way to do things 
and an upside-down way of doing 
things. To have had the House not go 
through a process that is thorough and 
complete and to just rush things 
through in a partisan and political 
manner and then dump it onto this 
Chamber to clean everything up is a 
very dangerous precedent to be set. As 
I said the other day, whatever is ac-
cepted in this case becomes the new 
normal. If this Chamber puts its impri-
matur on this process, then that is the 
seal of approval for all time in the fu-
ture. 
If it becomes that easy for the House 
of Representatives to impeach a Presi-
dent of the United States—don’t at-
tempt to subpoena the witnesses, never 
mind litigation because it takes too 
long, but then leave it all to this 
Chamber—and, as I said the other day: 
Remember, what do we think will hap-
pen if some of these witnesses are sub-
poenaed now that they never bothered 
to litigate about? Then there will be 
the litigation now, most likely, and 
then that will take time while this 
Chamber is still stuck sitting as a 
Court of Impeachment. 
That is not the way to do things, and 
it would forever change the relation-
ship between the House of Representa-
tives and the Senate in terms of the 
way impeachments operate. 
So I think it is vitally important for 
this Chamber to consider what it really 
means to start having this Chamber do 
all that investigatory work, how this 
Chamber would be paralyzed by that. 
And is that really the precedent? Is 
that the way this Chamber wants ev-
erything to operate in the future? Once 
you make it that much easier—and we 
have said this on a couple of different 
points, both in terms of the standards 
for impeachable offenses but also in 
terms of the process that is used in the 
House. If you make it really way too 
easy to impeach a President, then this 
Chamber is going to be dealing with 
that all the time. 
As Minority Leader SCHUMER
had 
pointed out at the time of the Clinton 
impeachment—he was prophetic, as 
White House counsel pointed out the 
other day—once you start down the 
path of partisan impeachments, they 
will be coming again and again and 
again. And if you make it easier, they 
will come even more frequently, and 
this Chamber is going to be spending a 
lot of time dealing with impeachment 
trials and cleaning up any incomplete, 
half-baked procedures, rushed partisan 
impeachments from the House if that 
is the sort of system that is given the 
imprimatur here. 
That is a very important reason for 
not accepting that procedure and not 
trying to open things up now when 
things haven’t been done properly in 
the House of Representatives. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator CAR-
PER’s question is for the House man-
agers: 
Some have claimed that subpoenaing wit-
nesses or documents would unnecessarily 
prolong this trial. Isn’t it true that deposi-
tions of the three witnesses in the Clinton 
trial were completed in only one day each? 
And, isn’t it true that the Chief Justice, as 
presiding officer in this trial, has the author-
ity to resolve any claims of privilege or 
other witness issues, without any delay? 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, the answer is yes. What is 
clear, based on the record that was 
compiled by the House of Representa-
tives, where up to five depositions per 
week were completed, is that this can 
be done in an expeditious fashion. 
It is important to note that the 
record that exists before you right now 
contains strong and uncontroverted 
evidence that President Trump pres-
sured a foreign government to target 
an American citizen for political and 
personal gain, as part of a scheme to 
cheat in the 2020 election and solicit 
foreign interference. That is evidence 
from witnesses who came forward from 
the Trump administration, including 
individuals like Ambassador Bill Tay-
lor, a West Point graduate and a Viet-
nam war hero; including individuals 
like Ambassador Sondland, who gave $1 
million to President Trump’s inaugura-
tion; including respected national secu-
rity professionals like LTC Alexander 
Vindman, as well as Dr. Fiona Hill—17 
different witnesses, Trump administra-
tion employees, troubled by the cor-
rupt conduct that took place, as al-
leged and proven by the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
But to the extent that there are am-
biguities in your mind, this is a trial. A 
trial involves witnesses. A trial in-
volves documents. A trial involves evi-
dence. That is not a new phenomenon 
for this distinguished body. The Sen-
ate, in its history, has had 15 different 
impeachment trials. In every single 
trial there were witnesses—every sin-
gle trial. Why should this President be 
treated differently, held to a lower 
standard, at this moment of Presi-
dential accountability? 
In fact, in many of those trials, there 
were witnesses who testified in the 
Senate who had not testified in the 
House. That was the case most re-
cently in the Bill Clinton trial. It cer-
tainly was the case in the trial of 
President Johnson. Thirty-seven out of 
the 40 witnesses who testified in the 
Senate were new—37 out of 40. 
Why can’t we do it in this instance, 
when you have such highly relevant 
witnesses like John Bolton, who had a 
direct 
conversation 
with 
President 
Trump, 
indicating 
that 
President 
Trump was withholding the aid because 
he wanted the phony investigations? 
Counsel has said the greatest inven-
tion in the history of jurisprudence for 
ascertaining the truth has been the ve-
hicle of cross-examination. Let’s call 
John 
Bolton. 
Let’s 
call 
Mick 
Mulvaney. Let’s call other witnesses, 
subject them to cross-examination, and 
present the truth to the American peo-
ple. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators COR-
NYN and GARDNER ask counsel for the 
President: 
What are the consequences to the Presi-
dency, the President’s constitutional role as 
the head of the executive branch, and the ad-
vice the President can expect from his senior 
advisers, if the Senate seeks to resolve 
claims of executive privilege for subpoenas 
in this impeachment trial without any deter-
mination by an article III court? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I thank the Senators for the ques-
tion. 
The Supreme Court has recognized 
that the confidentiality of communica-
tions with the President is essential— 
keeping those communications con-
fidential is essential for the proper 
functioning of the government. 
In Nixon v. United States, the court 
explained that this privilege is ground-
ed in the separation of powers and es-
sential for the functioning of the exec-
utive for this reason: In order to re-
ceive candid advice, the President has 
to be able to be sure that those who are 
speaking with him have the confidence 
that what they say is not going to be 
revealed, that their advice can remain 
confidential. If it is not confidential, 
they would temper what they are say-
ing; they wouldn’t be candid with the 
President; and the President, then, 
would not be able to get the best ad-
vice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S655 
January 29, 2020 
It is the same concern that underpins 
the deliberative process aspect of exec-
utive privilege. Even if it is not a com-
munication directly with the Presi-
dent, if it is the deliberative process 
within the executive branch, people 
have to be able, before coming up with 
a decision, to discuss alternatives, to 
probe what other ways might work to 
address the problem, and to discuss 
them candidly and openly, not with the 
feeling that the first thing they say is 
going to be on the front page of the 
Washington Post the next day, because 
if you don’t have the confidence that 
what you are saying is going to be kept 
confidential, you will not be candid, 
you will not give your best advice, and 
that damages decision-making. It is 
bad for the government, and it is bad 
for the people of the United States be-
cause it means the government and the 
executive branch can’t function effi-
ciently. 
So there is a critical need for the ex-
ecutive to be able to have these privi-
leges and to protect them, and that is 
why the Supreme Court recognized 
that in Nixon v. United States and 
pointed out that there has to be some 
very high showing of need from an-
other branch of government if there is 
going to be any breach of that privi-
lege. 
That is why there is an accommoda-
tions process. The courts have said 
that, when the Congress and the legis-
lature seek information from the exec-
utive and the executive has confiden-
tiality interests, both branches are 
under an obligation to try to come to 
some accommodation to address the in-
terests of both branches. But it is not 
a situation of simply that the Congress 
is supreme and can demand informa-
tion from the executive and the execu-
tive must present everything. The 
courts have made that clear, because 
that would be damaging to the func-
tioning of government. 
So here, in this case, there are vital 
interests at stake. And one of the po-
tential witnesses that the House man-
agers have raised again and again is 
John Bolton. John Bolton was a Na-
tional Security Advisor to the Presi-
dent. He has all of the Nation’s secrets 
from the time that he was the National 
Security Advisor, and that is precisely 
the area, the field, in which the Su-
preme Court suggested, in Nixon v. 
United States, there might be some-
thing approaching an absolute privi-
lege of confidentiality in communica-
tions with the President: the fields of 
national security and foreign affairs. 
That is the crown jewel of executive 
privilege. 
So to suggest that the National Secu-
rity Advisor—well, we will just sub-
poena him, and he will come in; that 
will be easy; there will not be any prob-
lem—that is not the way it would work 
because there is a vital constitutional 
privilege at stake there, and it is im-
portant for the institution of the Office 
of the Presidency, for every President, 
to protect that privilege, because once 
precedents start to be set—if one Presi-
dent says: Well, I will not insist on the 
privilege then; I will let people inter-
view this person; I will not insist on 
the immunity—that sets precedent. 
Then the next time, when it is impor-
tant to preserve the privilege, the 
precedent is raised, and the privilege 
has been weakened—and is forever 
weakened—and that damages the func-
tioning of government. 
So this is a very serious issue to con-
sider. It is important. The Supreme 
Court has made it clear for the proper 
functioning of the executive branch, 
for the proper functioning of our gov-
ernment. And there would be grave 
issues raised attempting to have a Na-
tional Security Advisor to the Presi-
dent come under subpoena to testify. 
That would all have to be dealt with, 
and that would take some time before 
things would continue. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator SCHATZ is directed to the 
House managers, and the question also 
is from Senator FEINSTEIN: 
If the President were acting in the interest 
of national security, as he alleges, would 
there be documentary evidence or testimony 
to substantiate his claim? If yes, has any 
evidence like that been presented by the 
President’s counsel? 
Mr. Manager CROW. Thank you, Mr. 
Chief Justice. Thank you, Senators, for 
the question. 
The answer is yes. There are well-es-
tablished processes, mechanisms, and 
agencies in place to pursue valid and 
legitimate national security interests 
of the United States—like the National 
Security Council; like the National Se-
curity Advisor, as in Ambassador John 
Bolton; and many other folks within 
the State Department and the Depart-
ment of Defense. And as we have well 
established over the last week, none of 
those folks, none of those agencies, 
would have been involved in having 
that deliberation, reviewing that evi-
dence, having that discussion, or incor-
porated into any type of interagency 
review process during the vast major-
ity of the time that we are talking 
about here. 
From the time of the President’s call 
on July 25 to the time the hold was 
lifted, those individuals, those agencies 
were in the dark. They didn’t know 
what was happening, and, more so, not 
only were they in the dark, but the 
President violated the law by violating 
the Impoundment Control Act to exe-
cute his scheme. None of that suggests 
a valid, legitimate policy objective. 
More so, the President himself and 
his counsel are bringing at issue the 
question of documents and witnesses. If 
over and over again, as we have heard 
in the last few days, the President was 
simply pursuing a valid, legitimate 
policy objective, if this was a specific 
debate about policy, a debate about 
corruption, a debate about burden- 
sharing, then, let’s have the documents 
that would show that. Let’s hear from 
the witnesses that would show that. 
The documents and the witnesses that 
we have forwarded and we have talked 
about show the exact opposite. 
The American people in this Chamber 
deserve to have a fair trial. The Presi-
dent deserves to have a fair trial. In 
fact, if he is arguing that there is evi-
dence, that there was a policy debate, 
then, I think everybody would love to 
see those documents, would love to see 
the witnesses and hear from them di-
rectly about what exactly was being 
debated. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. I send a question to 
the desk from myself and Senator 
CRUZ. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator GRA-
HAM and Senator CRUZ pose this ques-
tion for the House managers: 
In Mr. SCHIFF’s hypothetical, if President 
Obama had evidence that MITT ROMNEY’s son 
was being paid $1 million per year by a cor-
rupt Russian company—and MITT ROMNEY 
had acted to benefit that company—would 
Obama have authority to ask that that po-
tential corruption be investigated? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. First of all, 
the hypothetical is a bit off because it 
presumes in that hypothetical that 
President Obama was acting corruptly 
or there was evidence he was acting 
corruptly with respect to his son. But, 
nonetheless, let’s take your hypo-
thetical on its terms. 
Would it have been impeachable if 
Barack 
Obama 
had 
tried 
to 
get 
Medvedev to do an investigation of 
MITT ROMNEY, whether it was justified 
or unjustified? The reality is, for a 
President to withhold military aid 
from an ally—or, in the hypothetical, 
to withhold it to benefit an adversary— 
to target their political opponent is 
wrong and corrupt—period, end of 
story. 
If you allow a President to ration-
alize that conduct, rationalize jeopard-
izing the Nation’s security to benefit 
himself because he believes that his op-
ponent should be investigated by a for-
eign power, that is impeachable. 
If you have a legitimate reason to 
think that any U.S. person has com-
mitted an offense, there are legitimate 
ways to have an investigation con-
ducted. There are legitimate ways to 
have the Justice Department conduct 
an investigation. 
I would suggest to you that for a 
President to turn to his Justice De-
partment and say, ‘‘I want you to in-
vestigate my political rival,’’ taints 
whatever investigation they do. Presi-
dents should not be in the business of 
asking even their own Justice Depart-
ment to investigate their rivals. 
The Justice Department ought to 
have some independence from the po-
litical desires of the President, and one 
of the deeply troubling circumstances

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S656 
January 29, 2020 
of the current Presidency is you do 
have a President of the United States 
speaking quite openly, urging his Jus-
tice Department to investigate his per-
ceived enemies. 
That should not take place either, 
but under no circumstances do you go 
outside of your own legitimate law en-
forcement process to ask a foreign 
power to investigate your rival, wheth-
er you think there is cause or you don’t 
think there is cause, and you certainly 
don’t invite that foreign power to try 
to influence an election to your ben-
efit. 
It is remarkable to me that we even 
have to have this conversation. Our 
own FBI Director has made it abun-
dantly clear—and it shouldn’t require 
an FBI Director to say this—that if we 
were approached with an offer of for-
eign help, we should turn it down. We 
should, of course, certainly not solicit 
a foreign country to intervene in our 
election. And whether we think there 
is grounds or we don’t, the idea that we 
would hold our own country’s security 
hostage by withholding aid to a nation 
at war to either damage our ally or 
help our adversary because they will 
conduct an investigation into our oppo-
nent, I can’t imagine any circumstance 
where that is justified, and I can’t 
imagine any circumstance where we 
would want to say the President of the 
United States can target his rival, can 
solicit, elicit foreign help in an elec-
tion, can help him cheat and that is 
OK, because that will dramatically 
lower the bar for what we have a right 
to expect in the President of the 
United States; and that is, they are 
acting in our interests. 
I would say it is wrong for the Presi-
dent of the United States to be asking 
for political prosecutions by his own 
Justice Department. I would say it is 
wrong for the President of the United 
States to ask a foreign power to engage 
in an investigation of his political 
rival, but, particularly, where, as we 
have shown here, there is no merit to 
that investigation is even more egre-
gious. You know there is no merit to it 
because he didn’t even want the inves-
tigation. 
The more accurate parallel, Senator, 
would be if Barack Obama said: I don’t 
even need you, Russia, to do the inves-
tigation; I just want you to announce 
it—because that portrays the fact 
there was no legitimate basis, because 
the President didn’t even need the in-
vestigation done. He just wanted it an-
nounced. There is no legitimate expla-
nation for that except he wanted their 
help in cheating the next election. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Chief Justice, I send a 
question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is 
from Senator PETERS and is for the 
House managers. 
Does the phrase ‘‘or other high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors’’ in Article II, Section 4 of the 
Constitution require a violation of the U.S. 
criminal code or is a breach of public trust 
sufficient? Please explain. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. The Fram-
ers were very clear that abuse of power 
is an impeachable offense. In explain-
ing why the Constitution must allow 
impeachment, 
Edmund 
Randolph 
warned that ‘‘the Executive will have 
great opportunities of abusing his 
power.’’ 
Alexander Hamilton described ‘‘high 
crimes and misdemeanors’’ as ‘‘offenses 
which proceed from the . . . abuse or 
violation of some public trust.’’ 
The Framers also described what it 
meant. It was impeachable for a Presi-
dent to abuse his pardon power to shel-
ter people he was connected with in a 
suspicious manner. Future Supreme 
Court Justice James Iredell said the 
President would be liable to impeach-
ment if he acted from some corrupt 
motive or other or if he was willfully 
abusing his trust. 
As was later stated in a treatise sum-
marizing centuries of common law, 
abuse of power occurs if a public offi-
cer, entrusted with definite powers to 
be exercised for the benefit of the com-
munity, wickedly abuses or fraudu-
lently exceeds them. 
So when the Framers said this—that 
abuse of power was impeachable—it 
was not just an empty, meaningless 
statement. Remember, the Founders 
had 
been 
participating 
with 
over-
throwing the British Government, a 
King who was not accountable. 
They incorporated the impeachment 
power into the Constitution late, actu-
ally, in the drafting of the Constitu-
tion. They knew they were giving the 
President many powers, and they speci-
fied, if he abused them, that those pow-
ers could be taken away. 
Now, the prior articles that the Con-
gress has had on impeachment did not 
include 
specific 
crimes. 
President 
Nixon was charged with abusing his 
power, targeting political opponents, 
engaging in a coverup. 
There was conduct specified. Some of 
it was clearly criminal. Some of it was 
not. But it was all impeachable because 
it was corrupt, and it was abusing his 
power. 
In the House Judiciary Committee, 
we had witnesses called by both Repub-
licans and Democrats. The Republican- 
invited constitutional law expert Jona-
than Turley testified unequivocally 
that it is possible to establish a case 
for impeachment based on a non-
criminal allegation of abuse of power. 
Every Presidential impeachment, in-
cluding this one, has included conduct 
that violated the law, but each Presi-
dential impeachment has included the 
charges directly under the Constitu-
tion. 
It is important to note that a specific 
criminal law violation was not in the 
minds of the Founders, and it wouldn’t 
make any sense today. You could have 
a criminal law violation, you could de-
face a post office box. That would be a 
violation of Federal law. We would 
laugh at the idea that that would be a 
basis for impeachment. That is not 
abuse of Presidential powers. It might 
be a crime. And yet, you could have ac-
tivities that are so dangerous to our 
Constitution, that are not a crime, 
that would be charged as an impeach-
able offense because they are an abuse 
of power. That is what the Framers 
worried about. That is why they put 
the impeachment clause in the Con-
stitution, and, frankly, they opined 
that, because of the impeachment 
clause, no Executive would dare exceed 
their powers. Regrettably, that pre-
diction did not prove true, which is 
why we are here today with President 
Trump having abused his broad powers 
to the detriment of our national inter-
est for a corrupt purpose, his own per-
sonal interests. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Senator. 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself and Senator MURKOWSKI. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Senator. 
The 
CHIEF 
JUSTICE. 
Senators 
ROUNDS and MURKOWSKI ask counsel for 
the President: 
Describe in further detail your contention 
that all subpoenas issued prior to the pas-
sage of H. Res. 660 are an exercise of invalid 
subpoena authority by the House commit-
tees. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice. 
Thank you, Senators, for that ques-
tion. 
As I explained the other day, this 
contention is based on a principle that 
has been laid out in several Supreme 
Court cases explaining that the Con-
stitution assigns powers to each House 
of the legislative branch: to the House 
of Representatives or to the Senate. 
And in particular, the language of the 
Constitution is clear in article I that 
the sole power of impeachment is as-
signed to the House—as to the House of 
Representatives as a body. It is not as-
signed to any committee, to a sub-
committee, or to any particular Mem-
ber of the House. 
And in cases such as Rumely v. The 
United States and the United States v. 
Watkins, the Court has been called— 
there are disputes about subpoenas. 
They are not specifically in the im-
peachment context, but they establish 
the general rule, a principle, that 
whenever a committee of either body 
of Congress issues a subpoena to some-
one and that person resists the sub-
poena, the courts will examine what 
was the authority of that committee or 
subcommittee to issue that subpoena. 
It has to be traced back to some au-
thorizing rule or resolution from the 
House of Representatives itself, for ex-
ample, in a House subcommittee. And 
the courts will examine—the Supreme 
Court has made clear that that is the 
charter of the committee’s authority. 
It gets its authority solely from an ac-
tion by the House itself. That requires

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S657 
January 29, 2020 
a vote of the House, either to establish 
the committee by resolution or to es-
tablish by rule the standing authority 
of that committee. And if the com-
mittee cannot trace its authority to a 
rule or a resolution from the House, 
then its subpoena is invalid. 
The Supreme Court made clear in 
those cases those subpoenas are null 
and void because they are ultra vires; 
they are beyond the power of the com-
mittee to issue. They can’t be enforced. 
Our point here is very simple. There is 
no standing rule in the House that pro-
vides the committees that were issuing 
subpoenas here, under the leadership of 
Manager SCHIFF, the authority to use 
the impeachment power to issue sub-
poenas. Rule 10 of the House defines 
the legislative jurisdiction of commit-
tees. It doesn’t mention the word ‘‘im-
peachment’’ even once. So no com-
mittee under rule 10 was given the au-
thority to issue subpoenas for impeach-
ment purposes. 
This has always been the case in 
every Presidential impeachment in the 
history of the Nation. There has always 
been a resolution from the House, first, 
to authorize a committee to use the 
power of impeachment before it in-
tended to issue compulsory process. So 
in this case, there was no resolution 
from the House. The authority, the 
sole power of impeachment, remained 
with the House of Representatives 
itself. And Speaker PELOSI, by herself, 
did not have authority merely by talk-
ing to a group of reporters on Sep-
tember 24, to give the powers of the 
House to any particular committee to 
start issuing subpoenas. So the sub-
poenas that were issued were invalid 
when they were issued. 
And then 5 weeks later, on October 
31, when the House finally adopted H. 
Res. 660, that authorized from that 
point—purported to authorize from 
that point the issuance of subpoenas. 
Nothing in that resolution addressed 
the subpoenas that had already been 
issued. It didn’t even attempt or pur-
port to say the ones that have already 
been issued, we are going to try to 
retroactively give authority to that. It 
is a separate question about whether 
that could have been done legally. 
They didn’t even attempt to do it. 
This is all explained in the opinion 
from the Office of Legal Counsel, which 
is in our trial memorandum attached 
as appendix C. It is a very detailed and 
thorough opinion; it is 37 pages of legal 
reasoning, but it explains all of this, 
the basic principle that applies, gen-
erally, and the history that it has al-
ways been done this way. There has al-
ways, in every Presidential impeach-
ment, been an authorizing resolution 
from the House. And the fact that 
there was none here—so there was no 
authority for those subpoenas—that 
means that 23 subpoenas that were 
issued were invalid. 
And this was explained, as I pointed 
out the other day, in letters from the 
administration to the committees—a 
letter from the White House, from 
OMB, I think the State Department— 
and in very specific terms, they set out 
this rationale. That is the basis on 
which those subpoenas were invalid, 
and they were properly resisted by the 
administration. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator CASEY’s question is directed 
to the House managers: 
In 
Federalist 
65, 
Alexander 
Hamilton 
writes that the subjects of impeachment are 
‘‘those offenses which proceed from the mis-
conduct of public men, or, in other words, 
from the abuse or violation of some public 
trust.’’ Could you speak broadly to the du-
ties of being a public servant and how you 
believe the President’s actions have violated 
this trust? 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate. 
President Trump used the powers of 
his office to solicit a foreign nation to 
interfere in our elections for his own 
benefit, and then he actively ob-
structed Congress in his attempts to 
investigate his abuses of power. These 
actions are clearly impeachable. The 
key purpose of the impeachment clause 
is to control abuses of power by public 
officials; that is to say, conduct that 
violates the public trust. 
Since the founding of the Republic, 
all impeachments have been based on 
accusations of conduct that violates 
the public trust. When the Framers 
wrote the phrase ‘‘high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors,’’ they intended to cap-
ture the conduct of public officials, 
like President Trump, who showed no 
respect for their oath of office. Presi-
dent Trump ignored the law and the 
Constitution in order to gain a polit-
ical favor. The Constitution and his 
oath of office prohibited him from 
using his official favor to corruptly 
benefit himself rather than the Amer-
ican people. That is exactly what the 
President did, illegally withholding 
military aid and a White House meet-
ing until the President of Ukraine com-
mitted to announcing an investigation 
of President Trump’s opponent. 
In the words of one constitutional 
scholar: ‘‘If what we’re talking about is 
not impeachable, then nothing is im-
peachable.’’ 
This is precisely the misconduct that 
the Framers created the Constitution, 
including 
impeachment, 
to 
protect 
against. 
I want to add something in reference 
to some of the comments that were 
made by some of the President’s coun-
sel a few minutes ago. They talk about 
the subpoena power, about the failure 
of the House to act properly in the sub-
poena power because they said the 
House did not delegate by rule—have a 
resolution authorizing the committees 
to offer subpoena power. They appar-
ently haven’t read the fact that the 
House has generally delegated all sub-
poena power to the committees. It 
wasn’t true at the time of the Watkins 
case; it wasn’t true 15 years ago; but it 
is true now. 
Second, the House power is the sole 
power of impeachment and the manner 
of its exercise may not be challenged 
from outside. Whether the President 
should be convicted upon our accusa-
tion is a question for the Senate, but 
how we reached our accusation is a 
matter solely for the House. 
Thirdly, they talked about executive 
privilege, and they pointed to the 
Nixon case that established executive 
privilege; that the President has a 
right to private, candid advice and, 
therefore, executive privilege is estab-
lished. The same case says that execu-
tive privilege cannot be used to hide 
wrongdoing and, in fact, President 
Nixon was ordered in that case to turn 
over all his material. 
Thirdly, there is a doctrine of waiver. 
You cannot use executive privilege or 
any other privilege if you waive it. The 
moment President Trump said that 
John Bolton was not telling the truth 
when he said that the President told 
him of the improper quid pro quo, he 
waived any executive privilege that 
might have existed. He cannot charac-
terize a conversation and put it into 
the public domain and then claim exec-
utive privilege against it. The Presi-
dent, by the way, never claimed execu-
tive privilege ever. He has claimed, in-
stead, absolute immunity—a ridiculous 
doctrine that the President has abso-
lute immunity from any questioning 
by the Congress or by anybody else. It 
is a claim rejected by every court that 
has ever considered it. 
Finally, the difference from this 
President and any other President 
claiming privilege of any sort is that 
this President told us in advance: I will 
defy all subpoenas, whatever their na-
ture. I will make sure that the Con-
gress gets no information. In other 
words: I am absolute. The Congress 
cannot question what I do because I 
will defy all subpoenas. I will make 
sure they get no information, no mat-
ter what their rights, no matter what 
their situation. 
That is the subject of our article II of 
the impeachment because that is a 
claim of absolute monarchical power. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I want to suggest 
that after two more questions on each 
side—I have been corrected, as I fre-
quently am—one more question on 
each side, we take a 15-minute break. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. ROBERTS. I send a question to 
the House counsel for a question. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator ROBERTS asks: 
Would you please respond to the argu-
ments or assertions the House managers 
made in response to the previous questions? 
This is directed to the counsel for the 
President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S658 
January 29, 2020 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate. I want 
to respond to a couple. 
First, with regard to the question or 
the issues that have been raised as it 
relates to witnesses, it is important to 
note that in the Clinton impeachment 
proceeding, the witnesses who actually 
gave deposition testimony were wit-
nesses who had either been interviewed 
by deposition in the House proceedings, 
grand jury proceedings, and then, more 
specifically, 
was 
Sid 
Blumenthal, 
Vernon Jordan, and Monica Lewinsky. 
New witnesses were not being called. 
That is because the House, in their 
process, moved forward with a full in-
vestigation. That did not happen here. 
There was another statement that 
was raised by Mr. Chairman SCHIFF, 
Manager SCHIFF, regarding the Chief 
Justice could make the determination 
on executive privilege. And again, with 
no disrespect to the Chief Justice, the 
idea that the Presiding Officer of this 
proceeding could determine a waiver or 
an applicability of executive privilege 
would be quite a step. There is no his-
torical precedent. There is no historic 
precedent that would justify it. 
But there is something else. If we get 
to the point of witnesses, then, for in-
stance, if one of the witnesses to be 
called by the President’s lawyers was 
ADAM SCHIFF in the role, basically, of 
Ken Starr—Ken Starr presented the re-
port and made the presentation before 
the House of Representatives. He had 
about 12 hours of questioning, I believe, 
is what Judge Starr had. If Representa-
tive SCHIFF was called as a witness, 
would, in fact, then issues of speech 
and debate clause privilege be litigated 
and decided by the Presiding Officer or 
would it go to court or maybe they 
would waive it, but those would be the 
kind of issues that would be very, very 
significant. 
Senator GRAHAM presented a hypo-
thetical, which Manager SCHIFF said, 
well, that is not really the hypo-
thetical, but hypotheticals are actually 
that; they are hypotheticals. To use 
Manager SCHIFF’s words, he talked 
about how it would be wrong if FBI or 
the Department of Justice was starting 
a political investigation of someone’s 
political opponent. 
I am thinking to myself, but isn’t 
that exactly what happened? The De-
partment of Justice and the FBI en-
gaged in an investigation of the can-
didate for President of the United 
States when they started their oper-
ation called Crossfire Hurricane. 
He said it would be targeting a rival. 
That is what that did. He said it would 
be calling for foreign assistance in 
that. In the particular facts of Cross-
fire Hurricane, it has been well estab-
lished now that, in fact, Fusion GPS 
utilized the services of a former foreign 
intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, 
to put together a dossier and that 
Christopher Steele relied on his net-
work of resources around the globe, in-
cluding Russia and other places, to put 
together 
this 
dossier, 
which 
then 
James Comey said was unverified and 
salacious. Yet it was the basis upon 
which the Department of Justice and 
the FBI obtained FISA warrants. This 
was in 2016, against a rival campaign. 
So we don’t have to do hypotheticals. 
It is precisely the situation. 
To take it an additional step, this 
idea that a witness will be called—if 
this body decides to go to witnesses— 
would be a violation of fundamental 
fairness. Of course, if witnesses are 
called by the House managers through 
that motion, the President’s counsel 
would have the opportunity to call wit-
nesses as well, which we would. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from California. 
Ms. HARRIS. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator HARRIS is for the House 
managers: 
President Nixon said, ‘‘When the president 
does it that means that it is not illegal.’’ Be-
fore he was elected, President Trump said, 
‘‘When you’re a star, they let you do it. You 
can do anything.’’ After he was elected, 
President Trump said that Article II of the 
Constitution gives him ‘‘the right to do 
whatever [he] want[s] as president.’’ These 
statements suggest that each of them be-
lieved that the president is above the law— 
a belief reflected in the improper actions 
that both presidents took to affect their re-
election campaigns. If the Senate fails to 
hold the President accountable for mis-
conduct, how would that undermine the in-
tegrity of our system of justice? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, I think this is exactly 
the fear. I think, if you look at the pat-
tern in this President’s conduct and his 
words, what you see is a President who 
identifies the state as being himself. 
When the President talks about the 
people who report his wrongdoing—for 
example, when he describes a whistle-
blower as a traitor or a spy—the only 
way you can conceive of someone who 
reports wrongdoing as committing a 
crime against the country is if you be-
lieve that you are synonymous with 
the country, that any report of wrong-
doing against the President—the per-
son the President—is a treasonous act. 
It is the kind of mentality that says 
that under article II, I can do whatever 
I want, that I am allowed to fight all 
subpoenas. 
Counsel has given a variety of expla-
nations for the fighting of all sub-
poenas. They might have had a plau-
sible argument if the administration 
had given hundreds of documents but 
reserved some and made a claim of 
privilege or if the administration has 
said: We will allow these witnesses to 
testify, but with these witnesses, with 
these particular questions, we want to 
assert the privilege. 
Of course, that is not what was done 
here. What we have, instead, is a shift-
ing series of rationales, of expla-
nations, and duplicitous arguments— 
some made in court and some made 
here—the argument that the subpoenas 
aren’t valid before the House resolu-
tion, and then with respect to sub-
poenas issued after the House resolu-
tion, like to Mulvaney, they are no 
good either. You have the argument 
made that, we have absolute immu-
nity, and the court that addresses this 
says: No, you don’t; you are not a King. 
That argument may have been thought 
of with favor by various Presidents 
over history, but it has never been sup-
ported by any court in the land, and 
there is no constitutional support for 
that either. 
There are documents that are being 
released right now, as we sit here, and 
it is a mystery to the country, and it is 
a mystery to some of us. How are pri-
vate litigants able to get documents 
through the Freedom of Information 
Act that the administration has with-
held from Congress? If they were oper-
ating in any good faith, would that be 
the case? Of course, the answer is no. 
What we have instead is, we are going 
to claim absolute immunity, although 
the court says that doesn’t exist. 
They said: You know, the House 
withdrew 
the 
subpoena 
on 
Dr. 
Kupperman. Why would they withdraw 
the subpoena on Dr. Kupperman when 
he was only threatening to tie you up 
endlessly in court? 
Now, we suggested to counsel for Dr. 
Kupperman that, if they had a good- 
faith concern about testifying—if this 
were really good faith and it were not 
just a strategy to delay; if it were not 
just part of the President’s wholesale 
‘‘fight all subpoenas’’—they didn’t need 
to file separate litigation because there 
was actually a case already in court in-
volving Don McGahn on that very sub-
ject that was ripe for a decision. In-
deed, the decision would come out very 
shortly thereafter. We said: Let’s just 
agree to be bound by what the McGahn 
court decides. 
They didn’t want to do that, and it 
became obvious once the McGahn court 
decision came out because the McGahn 
court said: There is no absolute immu-
nity. You must testify. 
By the way, if you think people in-
volved in national security—i.e. Dr. 
Kupperman and John Bolton, if you are 
listening—are somehow absolutely im-
mune, they are not. 
So did Dr. Kupperman say: ‘‘Now I 
have the comfort I need because the 
court has weighed in’’? The answer is, 
of course not. 
Counsel says: Well, we might have 
gotten 
a 
quick 
judgment 
in 
Kupperman. 
Yes—in the lower court. 
Do any of you believe for a single 
minute that they wouldn’t appeal to 
the court of appeals and to the Su-
preme Court and that if the Supreme 
Court struck down the absolute immu-
nity argument, they wouldn’t be back 
in the district court, saying: ‘‘OK. He is 
not asking for absolute immunity any-
more, but we are going to claim execu-
tive privilege over specific conversa-
tions that go to the President’s wrong-
doing’’?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S659 
January 29, 2020 
That is the sign of a President who 
believes that he is above the law, that 
article II empowers him to do anything 
he wants. 
I will say this: If you accept that ar-
gument—if you accept the argument 
that the President of the United States 
can tell you to pound sound when you 
try to investigate his wrongdoing— 
there will be no force behind any Sen-
ate subpoena in the future. 
The ‘‘fighting all subpoenas’’ started 
before the impeachment. If you allow a 
President to obstruct Congress so com-
pletely in a way that Nixon could never 
have contemplated, nor would the Con-
gress of that day have allowed, you will 
eviscerate your own oversight capa-
bility. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate stand in recess until 4 p.m. 
There being no objection, the Senate, 
at 3:38 p.m., recessed until 4:06 p.m. and 
reassembled when called to order by 
the CHIEF JUSTICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
have a question for the President’s 
counsel, and it is cosponsored by Sen-
ators ROUNDS, WICKER, ERNST, BLACK-
BURN, TILLIS, CRAMER, COTTON, SUL-
LIVAN, MCSALLY, all members of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senators 
ask the following question of the coun-
sel for the President: 
Mr. Cipollone, as Members of the Senate 
Armed Committee, we listened intently 
when Manager CROW was defending one of 
Senator SCHUMER’s amendments to the orga-
nizing resolution last week as he explained 
how he had firsthand experience being denied 
military aid when he needed it during his 
service. As you know, David Hale, Under 
Secretary of State for Political Affairs, con-
firmed that the lethal aid provided to 
Ukraine last year was future aid. Which 
would you say had the greater military im-
pact: President Trump’s temporary pause of 
48 days on future aid that will now be deliv-
ered to Ukraine, or President Obama’s stead-
fast refusal to provide lethal aid to Ukraine 
for 3 years—more than 1,000 days—while 
Ukraine attempted to hold back Russia’s in-
vasion and preserve its sovereignty? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice. Thank you, Senators for that 
question. 
I think it was far more serious and 
far more jeopardy for the Ukrainians 
the decision of the Obama administra-
tion to not use the authority that was 
given by Congress—that many of you 
all, many Members of the House of 
Representatives voted for—giving the 
U.S. Government the authority to pro-
vide lethal aid to the Ukrainians, and 
the Obama administration decided not 
to provide that aid. 
And multiple witnesses who were 
called in the House by the House 
Democrats testified that United States 
policy toward Ukraine got stronger 
under the Trump administration, in 
part, largely, because of that lethal 
aid. 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch, 
Ambas-
sador Volker, others also testified that 
U.S. policy providing that aid was 
greater support for Ukraine than was 
provided in the Obama administration, 
particularly the provision of Javelin 
anti-tank missiles, which they ex-
plained were lethal and would kill Rus-
sian tanks and change the calculus for 
aggression from the Russians in the 
Donbas region in the eastern portion of 
Ukraine where that conflict was still 
ongoing. 
In terms of the pause, the temporary 
pause on aid here, the testimony in the 
record—put aside what the House man-
agers have said about their speculation 
and they know what it is like to be de-
nied aid—the testimony in the record 
is that this temporary pause was not 
significant. 
And 
as 
for 
Volker, 
Ambassador 
Volker testified that the brief pause on 
releasing the aid was ‘‘not significant.’’ 
And Under Secretary of State for Po-
litical Affairs David Hale explained 
that this is ‘‘future assistance, not to 
keep the Army going now.’’ 
So, in other words, this isn’t money 
that had to flow every month in order 
to fund current purchases or something 
like that. It was money—it is 5-year 
money. Once it is obligated, it is there 
for 5 years, and it usually takes quite a 
bit of time to spend all of it. 
So the idea, somehow, that during 
the couple of months in July, August, 
and up until September 11—55 or 48 
days, depending upon how you count 
it—that this was somehow denying 
critical assistance to the Ukrainians 
on the frontlines right then is simply 
not true. 
And now the House managers have 
tried to pivot away from that because 
they know it is not true. They say: No, 
it was a signal to the Russians. It was 
a signal of lack of support that the 
Russians would pick up on. But here 
again, it is critical, even the Ukrain-
ians didn’t know that the aid had been 
paused, and part of the reason was they 
never brought it up in any conversa-
tions with representatives of the U.S. 
Government. 
And 
as 
Ambassador 
Volker testified, representatives of the 
U.S. Government didn’t bring it up to 
them because they didn’t want anyone 
to know; they didn’t want to put out 
any signal that might be perceived by 
the Russians or by the Ukrainians as 
any sign of lack of support. It was kept 
internal to the U.S. Government. 
They pointed to some emails that 
someone at the Department of Defense 
or Department of State, Laura Cooper, 
received from unnamed Embassy staff-
ers suggesting that there was a ques-
tion about the aid, but her testimony 
was that she couldn’t even remember 
what the question really was, and she 
didn’t want to speculate. 
There is not evidence that any deci-
sion makers in the Ukraine Govern-
ment knew about the pause. 
And just the other day, another arti-
cle came out—I believe it was from, at 
the 
time, 
the 
Foreign 
Minister 
Danylyuk—explaining that when the 
POLITICO article was published on Au-
gust 28, there was panic in Kyiv be-
cause it was the first time they real-
ized there was any pause on the aid. So 
that was not something that was pro-
viding any signal either to the Ukrain-
ians or the Russians because it wasn’t 
known. It was 2 weeks later, after it 
became public, that the aid was re-
leased. 
The testimony in the record is that 
the pause was not significant; it was 
future money, not for current pur-
chases; and it was released before the 
end of the fiscal year. 
They point out that some of it wasn’t 
out the door by the end of the fiscal 
year. That happens every year. There 
is some percentage that doesn’t make 
it out the door by the end of the year. 
Again, it is 5-year money. It is not 
like it is all going to be spent in the 
next 30, 60, 90 days anyway. So the fact 
that there was a little fix—Congress 
passed a fix to allow that $35 million to 
be spent; something similar happens 
for some amount almost every year; 
and it was not affecting current pur-
chases—it 
wasn’t 
jeopardizing 
any-
thing at the frontlines. There is no evi-
dence about that in the record. The 
evidence is to the contrary. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Maine is recog-
nized. 
Mr. KING. Mr. Chief Justice, I have a 
question for both sets of counsel, which 
I send to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator KING is for both counsel 
for the President and House managers: 
President Trump’s former chief of staff, 
General John Kelly has reportedly said, ‘‘I 
believe John Bolton’’ and suggests Bolton 
should testify, saying, ‘‘If there are people 
that could contribute to this, either inno-
cence or guilt, I think they should be heard.’’ 
Do you agree with General Kelly that they 
should be heard? 
I think, counsel for the President, it 
is your turn to go first. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Sen-
ate, this was a bit of a topic that I dis-
cussed yesterday, and that was the in-
formation that came out of the New 
York Times piece about what is pur-
portedly in a book by Ambassador 
Bolton. 
Now, as I said, the idea that a manu-
script is not in the book—there is not 
a quote from the manuscript in the 
book; this is a perception of what the 
statement might be. There have been 
very forceful statements, not just from 
the President but from the Attorney 
General. The Department of Justice 
stated that while the Department of 
Justice has not reviewed Mr. Bolton’s 
manuscript, the New York Times ac-
count of this conversation grossly 
mischaracterizes what Attorney Gen-
eral Barr and Mr. Bolton discussed. -

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S660 
January 29, 2020 
There was no discussion of his getting 
any personal favors or undue influence 
for the investigation, nor did Attorney 
General Barr state that the President’s 
conversations with foreign leaders were 
improper. So again, that goes to some 
of the allegations that were in the arti-
cle. 
The Vice President said the same 
thing. He said: In every conversation 
with the President and Vice President, 
in preparation for our trip to Poland, 
the President consistently expressed 
his frustration that the United States 
was bearing the lion’s share of respon-
sibility. 
There is also an interview that Am-
bassador Bolton had given, I think in 
August, about the conversation, where 
he said it was a perfectly appropriate 
conversation. I think that information 
is publicly available now. 
So again, to move that into a change 
in proceeding, so to speak, I think is 
not correct. The evidence that has al-
ready been presented, an accusation 
that if you get into witnesses, and I 
will do this very briefly—if we get 
down the road on the witness issues, 
let’s be clear, it should not be—I cer-
tainly can’t dictate to this body—it 
should certainly not be, though, that 
the House managers get John Bolton, 
and the President’s lawyers get no wit-
nesses. We would expect that if they 
are going to get witnesses, we will get 
witnesses, and those witnesses would 
then—but all of that, just to be clear, 
changes the nature and scope of the 
proceedings. They didn’t ask for it be-
fore. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, Mr. 
Chief Justice: What is the significance 
of the President’s former Chief of Staff 
saying that he believes John Bolton 
and implicitly does not believe the 
President, that Bolton should testify? 
It is really, at the end of the day, not 
whether I believe John Bolton or 
whether General Kelly believes John 
Bolton but whether you believe John 
Bolton or whether you will have an op-
portunity to hear directly from John 
Bolton or whether you will have the 
opportunity to evaluate his credibility 
for yourself. 
There are a few arguments made 
against this. Some are rather extraor-
dinary. It would be unprecedented, the 
suggestion, I think is, to have wit-
nesses in the trial. What an extraor-
dinary idea. But as my colleagues have 
said, it would be extraordinary not to. 
This would be the first impeachment 
trial in history that involves no wit-
nesses, if you decide you don’t want to 
hear from any, that you simply want to 
rely on what was investigated in the 
House. That would be unprecedented. 
Yes, we should be able to call wit-
nesses, and, yes, so should the Presi-
dent—relevant witnesses. 
Now, the President says that you 
can’t believe John Bolton, and Mick 
Mulvaney says you can’t believe John 
Bolton. Well, let the President call 
Mick Mulvaney, another relevant wit-
ness with firsthand information. If he 
is willing to say publicly, not under 
oath, that Bolton is wrong, let him 
come and say that under oath. Yes, we 
are not saying that just one side gets 
to call witnesses; both sides get to call 
relevant witnesses. 
Now, they also make the argument, 
implicitly, that this is going to take 
long. Senators, warn you, if you want 
to have a real trial, it is going to re-
quire witnesses, and that is going to 
take time. I think the underlying 
threat—and I don’t mean this in a 
harsh way—is: We are going to make 
this really time-consuming. 
The depositions took place very 
quickly in the House. We have a per-
fectly good Chief Justice behind me 
that can rule on evidentiary issues. 
What is more, the President has waived 
and waived and waived any claim about 
national security here by talking about 
himself, 
by 
declassifying 
the 
call 
record. 
We are not interested in asking 
Bolton about Venezuela or other places 
or other countries, just Ukraine. If 
there is any question about it, the 
Chief Justice can resolve. These are 
relevant questions to the matter at 
hand. What you cannot do is use privi-
lege to hide any wrongdoing of an im-
peachable kind and character. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. Chief Justice, I send a 
question to the desk on behalf of my-
self and Senators CRUZ and HAWLEY. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is 
directed to counsel for the President: 
Is it true that Sean Misko, Abigail Grace, 
and the alleged whistleblower were employed 
by or detailed to the National Security 
Council during the same time period between 
January 20, 2017, and the present? Do you 
have reason to believe that they knew each 
other? Do you have any reason to believe 
that the alleged whistleblower and Misko co-
ordinated to fulfill their reported commit-
ment to ‘‘do everything we can to take out 
the President’’? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, the only knowledge that 
we have—that I have of this comes 
from public reports. I gather that there 
is a news report in some publication 
that suggests a name for the whistle-
blower, suggests where he worked, that 
he worked at that time while detailed 
to the NSC staff for then-Vice Presi-
dent Biden and that there were others 
who worked there. We have no knowl-
edge of that, other than what is in 
those public reports, and I don’t want 
to get into speculating about that. It is 
something that, to an unknown extent, 
may have been addressed in the testi-
mony of the inspector general of the 
intelligence community before Chair-
man SCHIFF’s committees, but that tes-
timony, contacts with the whistle-
blower, contacts between members of 
Manager SCHIFF’s staff and the whistle-
blower are shrouded in secrecy to this 
day. We don’t know what the testi-
mony of the ICIG was. That remains 
secret. It has not been forwarded. 
We 
don’t 
know 
what 
Manager 
SCHIFF’s staff’s contact with the whis-
tleblower have been and what connec-
tions there are there. It is something 
that would seem to be relevant, since 
the whistleblower started this entire 
inquiry, but I can’t make any represen-
tations that we have particular knowl-
edge of the facts suggested in the ques-
tion. We know that there was a public 
report 
suggesting 
connections 
and 
prior working relationships between 
certain people—not something that I 
can comment on other than to say that 
there is a report there. 
We don’t know what the ICIG dis-
cussed. We don’t know what the ICIG 
was told by the whistleblower. Other 
public reports about inaccuracies in 
the whistleblower’s report to the ICIG, 
we don’t know the testimony on that. 
We don’t know the situation of the 
contacts, coordination, advice provided 
by Manager SCHIFF’s staff to the whis-
tleblower. That all remains unknown, 
but something that obviously—to get 
to the bottom of motivations, bias, 
how this inquiry was all created could 
potentially be relevant. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for the 
President’s counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. 
When did the President’s counsel first 
learn that the Bolton manuscript had been 
submitted to the White House for review, 
and has the President’s counsel or anyone 
else in the White House attempted in any 
way to prohibit, block, disapprove, or dis-
courage John Bolton, or his publisher, from 
publishing his book? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice, and thank you, Sen-
ator, for the question. 
At some point—I don’t know off the 
top of my head the exact date—the 
manuscript had been submitted to the 
NSC for review. It is with career NSC 
staff for review. The White House 
Counsel’s Office was notified that it 
was there. The NSC has released a 
statement explaining that it has not 
been reviewed by anyone outside NSC 
staff. 
In terms of the second part of the 
question, has there been any attempt 
to prevent its publication or to block 
its publication, I think that there was 
some misinformation put out into the 
public realm earlier today, and I can 
read for you a relatively short letter 
that was sent from NSC staff to 
Charles Cooper, who is the attorney for 
Mr. Bolton, on January 23, which was 
last week. 
It says: 
Dear Mr. Cooper: Thank you for speaking 
yesterday by telephone. As we discussed, the 
National Security Council . . . Access Man-
agement directorate has been provided the 
manuscript submitted by your client, former 
Assistant to the President for National Secu-
rity Affairs John Bolton, for prepublication 
review. Based on our preliminary review, the

manuscript appears to contain significant 
amounts of classified information. It also ap-
pears that some of this classified informa-
tion is at the TOP SECRET level, which is 
defined by Executive Order 13526 as informa-
tion that ‘‘reasonably could be expected to 
cause exceptionally grave harm to the na-

The manuscript remains under review in 
order for us to do our best to assist your cli-

harm the national security of the United 
States. We will do our best to work with you

prepublication review. 
Through 
his 
lawyer, 
Ambassador 
Bolton was notified that the manu-
script he submitted contains a signifi-
cant amount of classified information, 
including at the top secret level, so 
that in its current form it can’t be pub-
lished but that they will be working 
with him as expeditiously as possible 
to provide guidance so it can be revised 
and so that he can tell his story. 
That is the letter from the NSC that 
went out. Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk on behalf of my-
self and Senators BURR, MCSALLY, 
DAINES, MORAN, YOUNG, and SASSE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senators’ 
question is directed to counsel for the 
President. 
Is it true the Trump administration ap-
proved supplying Javelin anti-tank missiles 
to Ukraine? Is it also true this decision came 
on the heels of a nearly three-year debate in 
Washington over whether the United States 
should provide lethal defense weapons to 
counter further Russian aggression in Eu-
rope? By comparison, did President Obama 
refuse to send weapons or other lethal mili-
tary gear to Ukraine? Was this decision 
against the advice of his Defense Secretary 
and other key military leaders in his admin-
istration? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators. Thank you, Senators, 
for the question. 
Yes, the Trump administration made 
the decision to provide Javelin anti- 
tank missiles, and there was a signifi-
cant debate about that for some time. 
Authorization had been granted by 
Congress, and many of you voted for 
that statutory authorization during 
the Obama administration to provide 
lethal assistance to Ukraine, but the 
Obama administration decided not to 
provide that. 
It was only the Trump administra-
tion that made that lethal assistance 
available, and there was a significant 
amount of testimony in the House pro-
ceedings that President Trump’s policy 
toward Ukraine was actually stronger. 
Ambassador Volker explained that 
America’s policy toward Ukraine has 
been 
strengthened 
under 
President 
Trump and that each step, along the 
way in decisions that got to the Jav-
elin missiles being provided, was made 
by President Trump. It is something 
that has substantially strengthened 
our relationship with Ukraine and 
strengthened their ability to resist 
Russian aggression. 
Ambassador Yovanovitch said that 
President Trump’s decision to provide 
lethal weapons meant that our policy 
actually got stronger over the last 3 
years, and she called it ‘‘very signifi-
cant.’’ 
Another point to make in relation to 
this is, again, that the pause—the tem-
porary pause that took place over the 
summer—is 
something 
that 
the 
Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister de-
scribed it as being so short that they 
didn’t even notice it. So President 
Trump’s policies, across the board, 
have been stronger than the prior ad-
ministration’s in providing defensive 
capability—lethal 
defensive 
capa-
bility—to Ukrainians, and I think that 
that is significant. 
As to the specific part of the ques-
tion, Senators, whether it was contrary 
to the advice of the President’s Defense 
Secretary and others, I believe that 
that is accurate. It was against the ad-
vice of the Secretary of Defense. It was 
President Trump’s decision to provide 
the lethal assistance, and that has been 
made public in the past. Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator FEIN-
STEIN. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. 
Chief Justice. I send a question to the 
desk on behalf of Senators CARPER, 
COONS, HIRONO, LEAHY, TESTER, UDALL, 
and myself to the House managers. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator FEINSTEIN and the other 
Senators is to the House managers: 
The President has taken the position that 
there should be no witnesses and no docu-
ments provided by the executive branch in 
response to these impeachment proceedings. 
Is there any precedent for this blanket re-
fusal to cooperate, and what are the con-
sequences if the Senate accepts this position 
here? 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, President Trump 
has taken really an extreme measure 
to hide this evidence from Congress. No 
President has ever issued an order to 
direct a witness to refuse to cooperate 
in an impeachment inquiry before this. 
Despite his famous attempts to con-
ceal 
the 
most 
damaging 
evidence 
against him, even President Nixon al-
lowed senior officials to testify under 
oath. Not only did he allow them; he 
told them to go to Congress volun-
tarily and answer all relevant ques-
tions truthfully. 
But President Trump issued a blan-
ket order directing the entire execu-
tive branch to withhold all documents 
and testimony from the House of Rep-
resentatives. His order was categorical. 
It was indiscriminate and unprece-
dented. Its purpose was clear: to pre-
vent Congress from doing its duty 
under the Constitution to hold the 
President accountable for high crimes 
and misdemeanors. 
Telling every person who works in 
the White House and every person who 
works in every department, agency, 
and office of the executive branch is 
just unprecedented. It wasn’t about 
specific, narrowly defined privileges. 
He never asserted privileges, and the 
President’s counsel has mentioned over 
and over that he had some reason be-
cause of the subpoenas. 
Well, I tell you, we adopt rules about 
subpoenas in the House. The Senate is 
a continuing body, but the House isn’t. 
In January, we adopted our rules, and 
it allows the committee chairman to 
issue subpoenas, and that is what they 
did. 
He refused to comply with those sub-
poenas, not because he exerted execu-
tive privilege but because he didn’t 
like what we were doing. He tried to 
say it was invalid, but it was valid. 
Actually, he doesn’t have the author-
ity to be the arbiter of the rules of the 
House. The House is the sole arbiter of 
its rules when it comes to impeach-
ment. 
Now, this refusal to give testimony, 
documents, and the like is still going 
on. We still have former or current ad-
ministration officials who are refusing 
to testify. You know, we would not 
allow this in any other context. You 
know, if a mayor said that I am not 
going to answer your subpoenas, they 
would be dealt with harshly if it was to 
cover up misdeeds and crimes, as we 
have here. The mayor would actually 
go to jail for doing that. 
If we allow the President to avoid ac-
countability by simply refusing to pro-
vide any documents, any witnesses— 
unlike every single President who pre-
ceded him—we are opening the door 
not just to eliminating the impeach-
ment clause in the Constitution. Try 
doing oversight. Try doing oversight, 
Senators, working without that in the 
House. If the President can just say, we 
are not sending any witnesses; we are 
not sending any documents; we don’t 
have to; we don’t like your processes; 
we have a wholesale rejection of what 
you are doing—that is not the way our 
Constitution was created. Each body 
has a responsibility. There is sharing of 
power. I, and I know you, cherish the 
responsibility that we have that would 
be eviscerated if the President’s com-
plete stalling is allowed to persist and 
be accepted by this body. You have to 
act now in this moment in history. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chief Justice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S662 
January 29, 2020 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Thank you. I send a 
question to the desk for the President’s 
counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator CAP-
ITO’s question is for counsel for the 
President: 
You said that Ukrainian officials didn’t 
know about the pause on aid until August 28, 
2019, when it was reported in POLITICO. But 
didn’t Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant 
secretary of defense for Russia, say that 
members of her staff received queries about 
the aid from the Ukrainian Embassy on July 
25? Does that mean that Ukrainian officials 
knew about the hold on aid earlier than the 
POLITICO article? 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, Sen-
ator, thank you for your question. 
It does not mean that. As we ex-
plained on Saturday, the overwhelming 
body of evidence indicates that the 
Ukrainians, at the very highest lev-
els—President Zelensky and his top ad-
visers—only became aware of the pause 
in the security assistance through the 
August 28 POLITICO article. 
I addressed this on Saturday—and so 
those comments will stand—the emails 
that Deputy Assistant Secretary of De-
fense Laura Cooper testified about pre-
viously. What she had said was that 
she—her staff—had gotten emails from 
someone at the State Department who 
had had some sort of conversation with 
Ukrainian officials here that somehow 
related to the aid at a time prior to 
August 28. She did not know the sub-
stance of the emails or whether they 
mention ‘‘hold,’’ ‘‘pause,’’ ‘‘review,’’ or 
anything of that nature. And she even 
said herself that she didn’t want to 
speculate as to what the emails meant 
and cannot say for certain what they 
were about. 
I presented on Saturday the evidence, 
which, again, is referencing the com-
mon sense that would be in play here. 
This was something that on August 28 
caused a flurry of activity among the 
highest ranking Ukrainian officials. 
Never before did they raise any ques-
tions at any of the meetings they had 
with the high-ranking U.S. officials 
through July and August. There were 
meetings on July 9, July 10, July 25 
call, July 26, and August 27. At none of 
those meetings was the pause on aid re-
vealed or inquired about. However, as 
soon as the POLITICO article came out 
on August 28, within hours of that PO-
LITICO 
article 
coming 
out, 
Mr. 
Yermak texted the article to Ambas-
sador Volker and asked to speak with 
him. That is consistent with someone 
finding out about it for the first time. 
The Ukrainians have also made state-
ments that they learned about it for 
the first time. 
And then Mr. Philbin just referenced 
an article that came out yesterday in 
the Daily Beast, which is an interview 
with Mr. Danyliuk, who was, at the 
time, a high-ranking defense official 
with the Ukrainians. This is inter-
esting, and I am going to read this arti-
cle because I think it is important, and 
I suggest it to the Senate if they wish 
to have something to consider further 
on this. 
Danyliuk said he first found out that the 
U.S. was withholding aid to Ukraine by read-
ing POLITICO’s article published Aug. 28. 
U.S. officials and Ukrainian diplomats, in-
cluding the country’s former Foreign Min-
ister Olena Zerkal, have said publicly that 
Kyiv was aware that there were problems 
with the U.S. aid as early as July. 
That is the article that they have 
mentioned in the statement that the 
House managers have mentioned. 
Here is Mr. Danyliuk: 
‘‘I was really surprised and shocked. Be-
cause just a couple of days prior to that . . . 
I actually had a meeting with John Bolton. 
Actually, I had several meetings with him. 
And we had extensive discussions. The last 
thing I expected to read was an article about 
military aid being frozen,’’ Danyliuk said. 
‘‘After that . . . I was trying to get the 
truth. Was it true or not true?’’ 
Danyliuk said that ‘‘it was a panic’’ inside 
the Zelensky administration after the initial 
news broke, saying Zelensky was convinced 
there had been some sort of mistake. 
That is President Zelensky. 
Danyliuk put in calls to the National Secu-
rity Council and asked other officials in 
Washington what to make of the news. 
Again, this is on August 28, or right 
after August 28. 
‘‘The next time we met in September . . . 
it was in Poland for the commemoration of 
the beginning of the Second World War’’— 
The Warsaw meeting we discussed 
previously— 
Danyliuk said, adding that he met with 
Bolton on the sidelines of the commemora-
tion. ‘‘I had my suspicions. There was a spe-
cial situation with one of our defense compa-
nies that were acquired by the Chinese. And 
the U.S. was concerned about this. Bolton 
actually made the public comments about 
this as well. So somehow I linked this to 
things and tried to understand. OK, maybe 
this could be related to this.’’ 
So not only did they not know until 
August 28—when they did find out—but 
they didn’t link it to any investiga-
tion. Where is the quid pro quo? If it is 
such at the forefront of their minds, 
such pressure on them that the Ukrain-
ians have to do these investigations to 
get the aid, when the aid was held up, 
they didn’t think it was connected to 
the investigations. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
have a question on behalf of Senator 
BALDWIN and myself, and I send it to 
the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is 
addressed to the House managers: 
Is the White House correct in its trial 
memorandum and in presentations of its 
case that ‘‘President Zelensky and other sen-
ior Ukrainian officials did not even know 
that 
the 
security 
assistance 
had 
been 
paused’’ before seeing press reports on Au-
gust 28, 2019, which was more than a month 
after the July 25 phone call between Presi-
dents Zelensky and Trump? 
Mr. Manager CROW. Thank you, 
Chief Justice and Senators, for the 
question. 
The answer is no. The evidence does 
not show that. We know that Defense 
Department official Laura Cooper tes-
tified that her staff received 2 emails 
from the State Department on July 25 
revealing that the Ukrainian Embassy 
was ‘‘asking about security assist-
ance,’’ and, in fact, counsel for the 
President brought up these emails just 
now. I would propose that the Senate 
subpoena those emails and we can all 
see for ourselves what exactly was hap-
pening. 
We also know that career diplomat 
Catherine Croft stated that she was 
‘‘very surprised at the effectiveness of 
my Ukrainian counterparts’ diplomatic 
tradecraft, as in to say they found out 
very early on, or much earlier than I 
expected them to,’’ and that LTC Alex 
Vindman testified that by mid-August 
he was getting questions from Ukrain-
ians about the status of security assist-
ance. 
So the evidence shows over and over 
again from the House inquiry that 
there was a lot of discussion, and there 
should be because we also know that 
delays matter. They matter a lot. You 
don’t have to take my word for it. This 
is not just about a 48-day delay. 
Ukrainians were consistently asking 
about it because it was urgent. They 
needed it. They needed it. 
You know who else was asking for 
it—American businesses. The contrac-
tors who were going to be providing 
this were also making inquiries about 
it because there is a pipeline. 
As my esteemed Senate Armed Serv-
ices colleagues know very well, pro-
viding aid is not like turning on and off 
a light switch. You have to hire em-
ployees. You have to get equipment. 
You have to ship it. It takes a long 
time for that pipeline to go. In fact, we 
had to come together as a Congress to 
pass a law to extend that timeline be-
cause we were at risk of losing it. And 
to this day, $18 million of that aid has 
still not been spent. 
Let’s just assume for a minute, also 
broadly speaking, that the President’s 
counsels’ argument that support for 
Ukraine has never been better than it 
is today, that under the Trump admin-
istration, they are the strongest ally 
Ukraine has seen in years. Just assum-
ing for a minute that argument to be 
true, it kind of makes our own argu-
ment. It kind of makes our argument: 
Then why hold the aid? Why hold the 
aid? Because nothing had changed in 
2016; nothing had changed in 2017; and 
nothing had changed in 2018. One thing 
had changed in 2019, and that was Vice 
President Biden was running for Presi-
dent. 
Lastly, the previous question by my 
Senate 
Armed 
Services 
colleagues 
framed this in terms of the military 
impact. They asked: What was greater 
in terms of military impact, not pro-
viding lethal aid or a 48-day delay? 
Let’s not forget the reason for the 
delay, because there is a lot of discus-
sion today about the technicalities of 
the delay and that the President’s

mentality, his mindset, doesn’t matter. 
It doesn’t matter what he intended to 
do. I would posit that is exactly why 
we are here—that it does matter what 
the President intended to do because in 
matters 
of 
national 
security, 
the 
American people deserve to go to bed 
every night knowing that the Presi-
dent, the Commander in Chief, the per-

them and their families and this coun-
try in mind, not the best interests of 
his political campaign. That is why we 
are here. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator. 
Ms. COLLINS. I send a question to 
the desk on behalf of myself and Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question is to counsel for the 
President: 
Witnesses testified before the House that 
President Trump consistently expressed the 
view that Ukraine was a corrupt country. 
Before Vice President Biden formally en-
tered the 2020 presidential race in April 2019, 
did President Trump ever mention Joe or 
Hunter Biden in connection with corruption 
in Ukraine to former Ukrainian President 
Poroshenko or other Ukrainian officials, 
President Trump’s cabinet members or top 
aides, or others? If so, what did the President 
say to whom and when? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
Of course, I think it is important at 
the outset to frame the answer by bear-
ing in mind I am limited to what is in 
the record, and what is in the record is 
determined by what the House of Rep-
resentatives sought. It was their pro-
ceeding. They were the ones who ran it. 
They were the ones who called the wit-
nesses. Part of the question refers to 
conversations 
between 
President 
Trump and other Cabinet members and 
others like that. There is not some-
thing in the record on that. It wasn’t 
thoroughly pursued in the record, so I 
can’t point to something in the record 
that shows President Trump, at an ear-
lier 
time, 
mentioning 
specifically 
something related to Joe or Hunter 
Biden. 
It is in the record that he spoke to 
President Poroshenko twice about cor-
ruption in Ukraine, both in June of 2017 
and again in September of 2017. But 
there is other information publicly 
available and in the record that I think 
is important for understanding the 
timeline and understanding why it was 
that the information related to the 
Bidens and the Burisma affair came up 
when it did. 
One important piece of information 
to bear in mind is that from the tapes 
we have seen, President Poroshenko 
was the person who Joe Biden himself 
went to to have the prosecutor fired. 
So as long as President Poroshenko 
was still in charge in Ukraine, he was 
the person who Joe Biden had spoken 
to to get the prosecutor, Shokin, fired 
when, according to public reports, 
Shokin was looking into Burisma. As 
long as he was still the President in 
Ukraine, it questioned the utility of 
raising an incident in which he was the 
one who was taking the direction from 
Vice President Biden to fire the pros-
ecutor. 
When you have an election in April of 
2019 and you have a new President— 
President Zelensky—who has run on an 
anti-corruption platform, and there is 
a question ‘‘Is he really going to 
change things; is there going to be 
something new in Ukraine?’’ it opens 
up an opportunity to really start look-
ing at anti-corruption issues and rais-
ing questions. 
The other thing to understand in the 
timeline is that we have heard a lot 
about Rudy Giuliani, the President’s 
private lawyer, and what was he inter-
ested in in Ukraine and what was his 
role? Well, as we know—it has been 
made public—Mr. Giuliani, the Presi-
dent’s private lawyer, had been asking 
a lot of questions in Ukraine dating 
back to the fall of 2018, and in Novem-
ber 2018, he said publicly he was given 
some tips about things to look into. 
He gave a dossier to the State De-
partment in March of this year. Re-
member, Vice President Biden an-
nounced his candidacy in April—April 
25. In March, Rudy Giuliani gave docu-
ments to the State Department, in-
cluding interview notes from inter-
views he conducted both with Shokin 
and with Yuriy Lutsenko, who was also 
a prosecutor in Ukraine. Those inter-
view notes are from January 23 and 
January 25, 2019—so months before 
Vice President Biden announced any 
candidacy—and it goes through in 
these interview notes, Shokin explain-
ing that he was removed at the request 
of Mr. Joseph Biden, the Vice Presi-
dent. It explains that he had been in-
vestigating Burisma and that Hunter 
was on the board, and it raises all of 
the questions about that. 
So it was Mr. Giuliani who had been, 
as Jane Raskin as counsel for the 
President explained the other day—Mr. 
Giuliani is looking into what went on 
in Ukraine: Is there anything related 
to 2016? Are there other things related 
there? 
And he is given this information— 
tips about this—and starts pursuing 
that as well. He is digging into that in 
January of 2019. 
We know that Mr. Giuliani is the 
President’s private counsel. I can’t rep-
resent specific conversations they had. 
They would be privileged. But we do 
know from testimony that the Presi-
dent said in a May 23 Oval Office meet-
ing with respect to Ukraine: Talk to 
Rudy. Rudy knows about Ukraine. It 
seems from that that the President 
gets information from Mr. Giuliani. 
Months before Vice President Biden 
announced his candidacy, Mr. Giuliani 
is looking into this issue, interviewing 
people, and getting information about 
it. 
In addition, in March of 2019, articles 
began to be published. Then three arti-
cles were published by ABC, by the 
New Yorker, and by the Washington 
Post before the July 25 call. 
On July 22, 3 days before the call, the 
Washington Post has an article specifi-
cally about the Bidens and Burisma. 
That is what makes it suddenly cur-
rent, relevant, probably to be in some-
one’s mind. 
That is the timeline. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you, 
Senator. 
Ms. HARRIS. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from California. 
Ms. HARRIS. Thank you. I send a 
question to the desk on behalf of Sen-
ator PATTY MURRAY and myself. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators HAR-
RIS and MURRAY ask the House man-
agers: 
The House of Representatives is now in 
possession of a tape of President Trump say-
ing of Ambassador Maria Yovanovitch, ‘‘Get 
rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don’t 
care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. 
Okay? Do it.’’ President Trump gave this 
order to Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two 
men who carried out Trump’s pressure cam-
paign in Ukraine at the direction of Rudy 
Giuliani. Does the discovery of this tape sug-
gest that if the Senate does not pursue all 
relevant evidence—including witnesses and 
documents—that new evidence will continue 
to come to light after the Senate renders a 
verdict? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The answer is 
yes. 
What we have seen, really, over the 
last several weeks, since the passage of 
the articles in the House of Represent-
atives, is that every week—indeed, 
sometimes every day—there is new in-
formation coming to light. 
We know there is going to be new in-
formation coming to light on March 17, 
when the Bolton book comes out; that 
is, if the NSC isn’t successful in redact-
ing it or preventing much of its publi-
cation. 
On that issue, I do want to mention 
one other thing in response to the 
question about the Bolton manuscript 
and what the White House lawyers 
knew. I listened very carefully to the 
answer to that question, and maybe 
you listened more carefully than I did. 
What I thought I heard them say in an-
swer to the question ‘‘What did they 
know about the manuscript and when 
did they know it?’’—their statement 
was very precisely worded: The NSC 
unit reviewing the book did not share 
the manuscript. 
Well, that is a different question 
than whether the White House lawyers 
found out what is in it, because you 
don’t have to circulate the manuscript 
to have someone walk over to the 
White House and say: You do not want 
John Bolton to testify. Let me tell 
you, you do not want John Bolton to 
testify. You don’t need to read his 
manuscript because I can tell you what 
is in it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S664 
January 29, 2020 
The denial was a very carefully word-
ed one. I don’t know what White House 
lawyers knew and when they knew it, 
but they did represent to you repeat-
edly that the President never told a 
witness that he was freezing the aid to 
get Ukraine to do these investigations. 
We know that is not true. We know 
that from the witnesses we have al-
ready heard from, but we also know— 
at least if the reporting is correct, and 
you should find out if it is—that John 
Bolton tells a very different story. 
There are going to continue to be 
revelations, and Members of this body 
on both sides of the aisle are going to 
have to answer a question each time it 
does: Why didn’t you want to know 
that when it would have helped inform 
your decision? 
In every other trial in the land, you 
call witnesses to find out what you 
can. Again, we are not a court of ap-
peals here. We are the trial court. We 
are not confined to the record below. 
There is no ‘‘below.’’ In answer to the 
Senator’s question about whether Don-
ald Trump ever brought up the Hunter 
Biden 
problem 
with 
President 
Poroshenko in the past, counsel says: 
Well, we are confined to the record be-
fore us. 
You are not confined to the record in 
the House, nor is the President. The 
President could call witnesses if they 
existed. There is nothing to prevent 
them from saying: As a matter of fact, 
tomorrow we are going to call such and 
such, and they are going to testify 
that, indeed, Donald Trump brought up 
Hunter Biden to President Poroshenko. 
There is nothing prohibiting them from 
doing that. 
At the end of the day, we are going to 
continue to see new evidence come out 
all the time. Among the most signifi-
cant evidence, we know what that is 
going to be. And the effort to suggest, 
well, 
because 
this 
President 
was 
stronger in Javelins than his prede-
cessor—when we know from the July 25 
call, the moment that Zelensky brings 
up the Javelins, what is the very next 
thing the President says? He wants a 
favor. 
The question is, Why did he stop the 
aid? Why did he stop the aid this year 
and no prior year? Was it merely a co-
incidence? Are we to believe it was 
merely a coincidence that it was the 
year that Joe Biden was running for 
President? Are we to believe that, of 
all the companies in all the land—of all 
the gin joints in all the land—of 
Ukraine, that it was just Hunter Biden 
walking into this one; that was the 
reason why; that he was interested in 
Burisma was just a coincidence that in-
volved the son of his opponent? 
But, look, more and more is coming 
out. Let’s make sure that you learn 
whatever you feel you need to know to 
render a judgment now, when it can in-
form your decision, and not later. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself, Senator CRAPO, and Senator 
RISCH. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senators 
ask counsel for the President: 
The President’s counsel has underscored 
the Administration’s ongoing anticorruption 
focus with our allies. At what point did the 
United States Government develop concerns 
about Burisma in relation to corruption and 
concerns with Russia? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I thank the Senators for that 
question. I think it bears on the answer 
that I was last giving to the last ques-
tion. 
This is something that became—of 
course, President Trump, in his con-
versation with President Zelensky in 
the July 25 call, as the transcript 
shows us, brought up a couple of 
things. He brought up burden-sharing 
specifically, and he raised the issue of 
corruption in two specifics: the specific 
case of potential Ukraine interference 
in the 2016 election, which he had heard 
about and asked about, and the inci-
dent involving the firing of a pros-
ecutor who, according to public re-
ports, had been looking into Burisma, 
the company that the Vice President’s 
son was on the board of. That was the 
President’s way of pinpointing specific 
issues related to corruption. 
So when did it become a part of the 
President’s concern, those issues re-
lated to corruption in Ukraine? Of 
course, we have the evidence that ev-
eryone in the government—and Fiona 
Hill testified to this—thought that 
anti-corruption was a major issue for 
U.S. policy with respect to Ukraine. 
When there was a new President elect-
ed in April, President Zelensky, that 
brought the possibility of reform to the 
forefront. 
Then we know that the President was 
receiving information from his private 
attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and he spoke 
in the Oval Office of, Rudy knows 
about the Ukraine. You guys go talk to 
him. 
He was explaining to the delegation 
that had just returned from the inau-
guration for the President, for Presi-
dent Zelensky, that he had concerns 
about Ukraine because they are all cor-
rupt. He kept saying: It is a corrupt 
country. I don’t know. They tried to 
get me in the election. 
So it draws again on, there is his spe-
cific experience with Ukrainian corrup-
tion because he knew from the public 
reports, as in the POLITICO article 
that has been referenced many times. 
The POLITICO article in January of 
2017 explained a laundry list of Ukrain-
ian Government officials who had been 
out there attempting to assist the Hil-
lary Clinton campaign and spread mis-
information or bad information or as-
sist in digging up dirt on members of 
the Trump campaign. 
Mr. Giuliani had been investigating 
things related to Ukraine in 2016 and 
was led to the information about the 
Burisma situation and Vice President 
Biden having the prosecutor fired. So 
that was in January that he had these 
interviews he turned over to the State 
Department in March. 
Then there were a series, also, of pub-
lic articles published. John Solomon, 
in The Hill, published an article in 
March. Rudy Giuliani tweeted about it 
in March. There was an ABC story in 
June. There was a two-part New York-
er story about the Bidens and Burisma 
in July. Then, on July 22, the Wash-
ington Post had an article and ex-
plained specifically on just July 22— 
this is 3 days before the July 25 call— 
the Washington Post reported that Mr. 
Shokin, the prosecutor, believed ‘‘his 
ouster was because of his interest in 
the company,’’ referring to Burisma, 
and he said that ‘‘had he remained in 
his post, he would have questioned 
Hunter Biden.’’ 
So I think it is a reasonable inference 
that, as there were these articles being 
published in close proximity to the 
time, this was information that was 
available to the President, and it be-
came available to him as something 
that was a specific example of poten-
tially serious corruption. And remem-
ber, everyone who testified, who was 
asked about it—does it seem like there 
is an appearance of a conflict of inter-
est? Does it seem like that is fishy? Ev-
eryone testified: Well, yes, there is at 
least an appearance of a conflict of in-
terest there. 
I think it was after the information 
had come to Mr. Giuliani—long before 
Vice President Biden had announced 
his candidacy—that it came to the at-
tention of the President and became 
something worth raising. Again, Presi-
dent Poroshenko is the one who fired 
the prosecutor. While he is still the 
President, there is not really as much 
of an opportunity or a possibility of 
raising that. So I think it was in that 
timeframe, along that arc of the tim-
ing, that it came to the President’s at-
tention, and that is why it was raised 
in that timing. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I have a question for the counsel 
for the President. 
The 
CHIEF 
JUSTICE. 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL asks: 
Did anyone in the White House, or outside 
the White House, tell anyone in the White 
House Counsel’s Office that publication of 
the Bolton book would be politically prob-
lematic for the President? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I thank the Senator for the ques-
tion. 
No, no one from inside the White 
House or outside the White House told 
us that the publication of the book 
would be problematic for the President. 
I think we assumed that Mr. Bolton 
was disgruntled, and we didn’t expect 
he was going to be saying a lot of nice 
things about the President, but no one 
told us anything like that. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S665 
January 29, 2020 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. I send a question to the 
desk on behalf of myself and Senators 
MORAN and HAWLEY. It is a question for 
the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from the Senators to the House man-
agers: 
An August 26, 2019, letter from the Intel-
ligence Community Inspector General to the 
Director of National Intelligence discussing 
the so-called whistleblower stated that the 
Inspector General ‘‘identified some indicia of 
an arguable political bias on the part of the 
Complainant in favor of a rival political can-
didate.’’ Multiple media outlets reported 
that this likely referred to the whistle-
blower’s work with Joe Biden. 
Did the so-called whistleblower work at 
any point for or with Joe Biden? If so, did he 
work for or with Joe Biden on issues involv-
ing Ukraine, and did he assist in any mate-
rial way with the quid pro quo in which then- 
Vice President Biden has admitted to condi-
tioning loan guarantees to Ukraine on the 
firing 
of 
the 
prosecutor 
investigating 
Burisma? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I thank the Senators for the ques-
tion, and I want to be very careful in 
how I answer it so as not to disclose or 
give an indication that may allow oth-
ers to identify the identity of the whis-
tleblower. 
First, I want to talk about why we 
are making such an effort to protect 
the identity of the whistleblower. 
If you could put up slide 48, this slide 
shows—it may be difficult for some of 
you to read, so let me try to—actually, 
if you could hand me a copy of that as 
well. I haven’t had a chance to dis-
tribute that to everyone. 
It is not just that we view the protec-
tion of whistleblowers as important. 
Members of this body have also made 
strong statements about just how im-
portant it is to protect whistleblowers. 
Senator GRASSLEY said: ‘‘This person 
appears to have followed the whistle-
blower protection laws and ought to be 
heard out and protected. We should al-
ways work to respect whistleblowers’ 
requests for confidentiality.’’ 
Senator 
ROMNEY: 
‘‘Whistleblowers 
should be entitled to confidentiality 
and privacy because they play a vital 
function in our democracy.’’ 
Senator BURR: ‘‘We protect whistle-
blowers. We protect witnesses in our 
committee.’’ 
Even my colleague, the ranking 
member, Mr. NUNES: ‘‘We want people 
to come forward, and we will protect 
the identity of those people at all 
cost.’’ 
This has been a bipartisan priority 
and one that we have done our best to 
maintain, so I want to be very careful, 
but let me be clear about several 
things about the whistleblower. 
First of all, I don’t know who the 
whistleblower is. I haven’t met them or 
communicated with them in any way. 
The committee staff did not write the 
complaint or coach the whistleblower 
what to put in the complaint. The com-
mittee staff did not see the complaint 
before it was submitted to the inspec-
tor general. The committee, including 
its staff, did not receive the complaint 
until the night before the Acting Direc-
tor of National Intelligence—we had an 
open hearing with the Acting Director 
on September 26, more than 3 weeks 
after the legal deadline by which the 
committee should have received the 
complaint. 
In short, the conspiracy theory, 
which I think was outlined earlier, 
that the whistleblower colluded with 
the Intel Committee staff to hatch an 
impeachment inquiry is a complete and 
total fiction. This was, I think, con-
firmed by the remarkable accuracy of 
the whistleblower complaint, which 
has been corroborated by the evidence 
we subsequently gathered in all mate-
rial respects. 
So I am not going to go into any-
thing that could reveal or lead to the 
revelation of the identity of the whis-
tleblower, but I can tell you, because 
my staff’s names have been brought 
into this proceeding, that my staff 
acted at all times with the most com-
plete professionalism. 
I am very protective of my staff, as I 
know you are, and I am grateful that 
we have such bright, hard-working peo-
ple working around the clock to pro-
tect this country and who have served 
our committee so well. It really grieves 
me to see them smeared. Some of them 
mentioned here today have concerns 
about their safety, and there are online 
threats to members of my staff as a re-
sult of some of the smears that have 
been launched against them. 
I can tell you there is no one who 
could understand the plight of Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch more than some of 
my staff who have been treated to the 
same kind of smears and now have con-
cerns over their own safety. They acted 
at all times with the utmost propriety 
and integrity. 
Your 
Senate 
Intelligence 
Com-
mittee—and your chairman and vice 
chairman 
can 
tell 
you—encourage 
whistleblowers to come to their com-
mittee, and so do we. When they do, we 
try to figure out, is their complaint 
within the scope of jurisdiction of the 
intelligence community? And if it is, 
then we suggest they get a lawyer or 
we suggest they talk to the inspector 
general, which is what happened here. 
The whistleblower did exactly what 
they should—except, for the President, 
that is unforgivable because the whis-
tleblower exposed the wrongdoing of 
the President. In the President’s view, 
that makes him or her a traitor or a 
spy, and, as the President tells us, 
there is a way we used to treat traitors 
and spies. 
You wonder why we don’t want to 
call the whistleblower. First of all, we 
know firsthand what the whistleblower 
wrote secondhand in that complaint. 
There is no need for that whistleblower 
anymore, except to further endanger 
that person’s life. That, to me, does not 
seem a worthwhile object for anyone in 
this Chamber or on the other side of 
this building, in the Oval Office, or 
anywhere else. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, on my own behalf and on behalf of 
Senators BLUMENTHAL, BOOKER, COONS, 
KLOBUCHAR, LEAHY, MARKEY, PETERS, 
and UDALL, I send a question to the 
desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is 
from Senator WHITEHOUSE and other 
Senators to the House managers: 
The ‘‘missing-witness’’ rule—which dates 
back to 1893 Supreme Court case Graves v. 
United States—allows one party to obtain an 
adverse inference against the other for fail-
ure to produce a witness under that party’s 
control with material information. Here, one 
party, the President, has prevented wit-
nesses within his control from testifying or 
providing documents. Do the House man-
agers believe Senators should apply the 
missing witness rule here, and if so, what ad-
verse inferences should we draw about the 
missing testimony and documents? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, we do believe that you 
should 
draw 
an 
adverse 
inference 
against the party resisting the testi-
mony of these witnesses, like John 
Bolton. Courts have long recognized 
that when a party has relevant evi-
dence within his control, which he fails 
to produce, that failure gives rise to an 
inference that that evidence is unfavor-
able to him. 
Courts have frequently drawn ad-
verse inferences where a party acts in 
bad faith to conceal evidence or pre-
clude witnesses from offering testi-
mony. 
I would suggest that it is bad faith 
when counsel comes before you and 
says that if you really wanted these 
witnesses, you should have sued to get 
them in the House and goes into the 
courtroom down the street and says: 
You can’t sue to get witnesses before 
the House. 
But that is what has happened here. 
And you are, I think, not only per-
mitted but absolutely should draw an 
adverse inference that when a party is 
making that argument on both sides of 
the courthouse, that the evidence those 
witnesses would provide runs against 
them. 
Now, the administration hasn’t pro-
duced a single document, not one sin-
gle document. That is extraordinary. 
They can argue executive privilege and 
absolute immunity. Most of that has 
nothing to do with the overwhelming 
majority of these documents, not a wit. 
There is no absolute immunity from 
providing documents. The vast, vast 
majority don’t have anything to do 
with privilege, and, if they did, there 
would be redactions, very specific 
redactions. None of that happened. 
Are you allowed to draw an adverse 
inference that the reason why the 
President’s team, which has possession 
of those emails regarding inquiries by 
Ukraine into why the aid was frozen— 
are you allowed to draw an inference— 
if they won’t show you those emails. 
Those 
emails 
would 
confirm 
that 
Ukraine knew the aid was withheld,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S666 
January 29, 2020 
just like the former Deputy Foreign 
Minister of Ukraine said publicly when 
she told the New York Times: Yes, we 
knew; by the end of July, we knew— 
this is the Deputy Foreign Minister at 
the time—we knew the aid was frozen, 
but I was instructed by Andriy Yermak 
not to mention it. I had a trip planned 
to Washington to talk to Congress, and 
I was told not to go. Why? Because 
they didn’t want it public. 
Are you entitled to draw an inference 
that those records they refused to turn 
over—all 
the 
State 
Department 
records; the fact that they won’t allow 
John Bolton’s notes to be turned over; 
they won’t let Ambassador Taylor’s 
notes to be turned over—should you 
draw an adverse inference? You are 
darned right you should. 
They say: Well, the President only 
told Sondland ‘‘no quid pro quo.’’ They 
leave 
out 
the 
other 
half 
where 
Sondland told Taylor: But he said, no 
quid pro quo, but you have to go to the 
mike and announce these investiga-
tions. 
Well, Ambassador Taylor wrote down 
the notes of that conversation. That 
took place right after that call with 
the President. Are you allowed to draw 
an adverse inference from the fact that 
they don’t want you to see Ambassador 
Taylor’s notes, from the fact they 
don’t want you to see Ambassador Tay-
lor’s cable? You are darned right you 
should draw an adverse inference. 
Finally, with respect to who has be-
come a central witness here, I think 
the adverse inference screams at you as 
to why they don’t want John Bolton. 
But you shouldn’t rely on an inference 
here, not when you have a witness who 
is willing to come forward. There is no 
need for inference here. It is just a need 
for a subpoena. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator

Mr. THUNE. I have a question to 
send to the desk. 
The 
CHIEF 
JUSTICE. 
Senator 
THUNE’s question is for counsel for the 
President: 
Would you please respond to the argu-
ments or assertions the House managers just 
made in response to the previous questions? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice. 
Thank you, Senator, for the ques-
tion. 
I haven’t read recently the case that 
was cited about the missing witness 
rule. So I can’t say specifically what is 
in it, but I am willing to bet that the 
missing witness rule does not apply 
when there has been a valid assertion 
of a privilege or other immunity for 
keeping the witness out of court. For 
example, if they tried to subpoena the 
defendant’s lawyer and the defendant 
said, ‘‘Wait, I have attorney-client 
privilege; you can’t subpoena him,’’ 
they are not going to be able to get an 
adverse inference from that. 
That is critical because, as I have 
gone through multiple times—and you 
know, we keep going back and forth on 
this—they keep representing that there 
was a blanket defiance and there was 
no explanation and there was no legal 
basis for what the President was doing. 
And it is just not true. There were let-
ters back and forth. I put them up on 
the screen. There were specific immu-
nities asserted. There were specific 
legal deficiencies in the subpoenas that 
were sent. 
This is important because if you are 
going to impeach the President of the 
United States, turning square corners 
and proceeding by the law matters. For 
the House managers to come here and 
say it was blanket defiance, it was un-
precedented, you have to draw an ad-
verse inference against them because 
they didn’t respond to any of our docu-
ment subpoenas—all the document sub-
poenas were issued without authoriza-
tion. Maybe they disagree with us, but 
they can’t just say we provided no ra-
tionale and you have to draw an ad-
verse inference. There is a specific 
legal rationale provided. 
They didn’t try to engage in the ac-
commodation process, and they didn’t 
try to go to court. And now, yes, it is 
true that our position is that when 
they go to the court, article III courts 
don’t have jurisdiction over that. Their 
position is, article III courts do have 
jurisdiction over that. 
They believe that they can get a 
court order to require us to comply 
with a valid subpoena, but they never 
tried to establish in court that their 
subpoenas were valid. We have an as-
sertion of a legal deficiency on one 
side. They think it is different. They 
don’t want to go to court to get it re-
solved. 
We have the assertion of absolute im-
munity from congressional compulsion 
for senior advisers to the President. It 
has been asserted by virtually every 
President since Nixon. They try to say: 
Oh, it is preposterous. It is irrelevant. 
We don’t have to worry about that. 
Every President since Nixon, vir-
tually, has asserted that. It has only 
been addressed by two district courts— 
trial-level courts. The first one re-
jected it, and its decision was stayed 
by the appellate court, which means 
the appellate court thought probably 
you got it wrong or, at a minimum, it 
is a really difficult question; we are not 
sure about that. And the second dis-
trict court decision is being litigated 
right now. They are litigating it. And 
when 
Charlie 
Kupperman 
went 
to 
court, they were trying to do some-
thing reasonable to say: Oh, well, we 
don’t want to litigate this with you; 
you should just agree to be bound by 
the McGahn decision. What is the say-
ing? Every litigant gets his day in 
court. 
Why 
shouldn’t 
Charlie 
Kupperman get to have his counsel 
argue that issue on his behalf? That is 
what he wanted. He didn’t want to say: 
I am going to trust it to the other peo-
ple litigating the other case. I’ve got 
my case. I want to make the argu-
ments. 
But they wouldn’t have that. So they 
mooted out the case. They withdrew 
the subpoena to moot out the case be-
cause they didn’t want to go to the 
hearing in front of Judge Leon on De-
cember 10. 
They have also pointed out, as if it is 
some outrage, that documents have 
been more readily produced under 
FOIA than in response to their sub-
poenas. But what that actually shows 
is that when you turn square corners 
and follow the law and make a request 
to the administration that follows the 
law, the administration follows the law 
and responds. And that is right. The 
documents were produced. Information 
came out. But they didn’t get it be-
cause they issued invalid subpoenas, 
and they didn’t try to do anything to 
establish the validity of their sub-
poenas. 
If you are going to be sloppy and 
issue invalid subpoenas, you are not 
going to get a response. But if some 
private litigant follows FOIA and sub-
mits a FOIA request, they get a re-
sponse. 
To act like the Trump administra-
tion has done some blanket denial of 
everything simply isn’t accurate, and 
there is no basis for any adverse infer-
ence because there is a specific privi-
lege or basis for every reason not to 
produce something. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from New Hampshire. 
Ms. HASSAN. Thank you, Mr. Chief 
Justice. 
I send a question to the desk for the 
House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator HAS-
SAN’s question is for the House man-
agers: 
Did acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney 
waive executive privilege in his October 17 
press conference in which he stated that 
there was ‘‘political influence’’ in the Trump 
administration’s decision to withhold aid to 
Ukraine? 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, distinguished Members of the 
Senate, I thank you for that question. 
Mick 
Mulvaney 
has 
absolutely 
waived executive privilege. He has 
never asserted executive privilege. In 
fact, as President’s counsel has ac-
knowledged, they have not asserted ex-
ecutive 
privilege 
once. 
President’s 
counsel has said, when we made that 
point during our opening arguments, 
that that was technically true. No, it is 
true. It is not an alternate fact; it is a 
fact. You have never asserted executive 
privilege in connection with Mick 
Mulvaney’s testimony or anyone else. 
It was not asserted as it relates to any 
of the 17 witnesses who testified, 12 of 
whom testified publicly. 
The other phony arguments that 
have been articulated, respectfully, are 
that the House needed to vote in order 
for the subpoenas to be valid. There is 
nothing in the Constitution that re-
quired the full House to vote, nothing

in Supreme Court precedent, nothing 
under Federal law, nothing under the 
House rules. It was a phony argument. 
Yet the House, after the initial stages 
of the investigation, did fully vote and 
fully voted on October 31. 
Interestingly enough, Mick Mulvaney 
was subpoenaed thereafter—not before, 
thereafter—after the House had voted, 
subpoenaed on November 7. Here it is. 
The next day, the White House re-
sponded. They responded with a two- 
page letter dated November 8. There is 
no mention of executive privilege in 
the November 8 letter, but here is what 
it does say: ‘‘The Department of Jus-
tice (the ‘‘Department’’) has advised 
me that Mr. Mulvaney is absolutely 
immune from compelled congressional 
testimony with respect to matters re-
lated to his service as a senior adviser 
to the President.’’ 
What is interesting about this letter 
from Mr. Cipollone is that it doesn’t 
cite a single legal case for that out-
rageous 
proposition—a 
single 
legal 
case for the proposition that Mick 
Mulvaney is absolutely immune. Why? 
Because there is no law to support it. 
The President tried to cheat, he got 
caught, and then he worked hard to 
cover it up. 
The Senate can get to the truth. You 
can get to the truth by calling wit-
nesses who can testify. Any privilege 
issues can be worked out by the Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court. The 
American people deserve a fair trial. 
The President deserves a fair trial. The 
Constitution deserves a fair trial. That 
includes 
Mulvaney. 
That 
includes 
Bolton. That includes other relevant 
witnesses. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I send a question to the desk on behalf 
of myself and Senator YOUNG and Sen-
ator CRAPO. The question is to be di-
rected to both parties. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question directed to counsel for 
the President and the House managers: 
The Constitution does not specify the 
standard of proof to be used in trials of im-
peachment, and the Senate has not adopted 
a uniform standard by rule, thus, the stand-
ard of proof is arguably a question for each 
individual Senator. In the Clinton trial and 
now with President Trump, it appears that 
Republicans and Democrats apply different 
standards depending on whether the Presi-
dent is a member of their party. What stand-
ard of proof should be used in trials of im-
peachment—preponderance of the evidence, 
clear and convincing, beyond a reasonable 
doubt—and why? 
I think it is the turn of the House 
managers to go first. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Senators, there is no court 
case on this. The House needs strong 
evidence, but it has never been decided 
beyond a reasonable doubt, as the 
President’s counsel has suggested, and, 
as the question notes, the Constitution 
does not specify either the House’s evi-
dentiary burden of proof or the Sen-
ate’s. 
I would note that the House Judici-
ary Committee held itself to a clear 
and convincing standard of proof in the 
Nixon matter, which requires that the 
evidence of wrongdoing must be sub-
stantially more probable to be true 
than not and that the trier of fact must 
have a firm belief in its factuality. In 
the Clinton case, the House did not 
commit to any particular burden of 
proof. And I would recommend against 
including an express standard; instead, 
like in Clinton’s, simply finding the 
facts and any inferences from those 
facts without legal technicalities. 
It has been opined that, in the end, it 
is up to each Senator to make a judg-
ment, and I think there is much truth 
to that. Your oath holds you to a find-
ing of impartial justice, and I trust 
that each and every one of you is hold-
ing that oath very dear to your heart 
and will find the facts and lead to a 
just result for our country, the Con-
stitution, and for a future that hope-
fully is as free as our past has been. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
I think that the Constitution makes 
it clear in the terms that it speaks of 
impeachment, all are related to the 
criminal law. It speaks of an offense. It 
speaks of conviction. It speaks of a 
trial in saying that crimes shall be 
tried by a jury except in the case of im-
peachment. 
In both that and the gravity of a 
Presidential impeachment, which is an 
issue of breathtaking importance for 
the country and could cause tremen-
dous disruption to our government, 
both counsel are in favor of traditional 
criminal standard of proof beyond a 
reasonable doubt. 
In the Clinton impeachment, Sen-
ators—both Republicans and Demo-
crats—repeatedly advocated in favor of 
that standard. 
Senator Russ Feingold then said: 
In making a decision of this magnitude, it 
is best not to err at all. If we must err, how-
ever, we should err on the side . . . of re-
specting the will of the people. 
Similarly, Senator Barbara Mikulski 
said: 
The U.S. Senate must not make the deci-
sion to remove a President based on a hunch 
that the charges may be true. The strength 
of our Constitution and the strength of our 
Nation dictate that the Senate be sure be-
yond a reasonable doubt. 
The preponderance standard is whol-
ly insufficient. That means just 50.1 
percent. You think it is a little more 
likely than not. That is not sufficient 
to remove the President. Even clear 
and convincing evidence is not. It has 
to be beyond a reasonable doubt. As 
Senator Rockefeller explained at the 
time of the Clinton impeachment, that 
means ‘‘it is proven to a moral cer-
tainty the case is clear.’’ That is the 
standard the Senators should apply be-
cause the gravity of the issue before 
you would not permit applying any 
lesser standard. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Thank you, sir. 
Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question 
to the desk to be asked of the House 
manager. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator BOOK-
ER’s question is for the House manager: 
Even if a communication or a document is 
covered by executive privilege, that privilege 
can be overcome by showing the evidence is 
important and unavailable elsewhere. On 
January 22, while this trial was underway, 
President Trump said, ‘‘I thought our team 
did a very good job. But honestly, we have 
all the material. They don’t have the mate-
rial.’’ Can you comment on whether execu-
tive privilege allows a President to conceal 
information from Congress, particularly if 
the evidence cannot be obtained elsewhere? 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice, and I thank the dis-
tinguished Senator from New Jersey 
for his question. 
President Trump alone has the power 
to assert executive privilege. As coun-
sel admitted on Saturday, the Presi-
dent had not formally invoked it over 
any document requested in this im-
peachment inquiry. This has not been 
asserted as it relates to any single doc-
ument. Executive privilege gives Presi-
dent Trump a qualified form of con-
fidentiality when he does get advice 
from his aides in order to carry out the 
duties of his office. 
As I know you are all aware, it is 
often the case in congressional inves-
tigations that a President will claim 
executive privilege over a very small 
subset of materials. In that case, what 
the executive branch usually does and 
should do is to produce everything that 
it can and then provide a log of docu-
ments in dispute or permit a private 
review of the documents that have 
been contested. 
That is not what has occurred in this 
case because the President has ordered 
the entire executive branch to defy our 
constitutionally inspired impeachment 
inquiry. Blanket defiance is what has 
taken place, and there is no right to do 
that. 
Every court that has considered the 
matter has asserted that the President 
cannot assert a privilege to protect his 
own misconduct, to protect wrong-
doing, to protect evidence that the 
Constitution may have been violated. 
The President cannot do it. 
In an impeachment inquiry, the con-
gressional need for information and its 
constitutional authority, of course, are 
at their greatest. It is imperative to in-
vestigate serious allegations of mis-
conduct that might constitute high 
crimes and misdemeanors, and that is 
what is before you right now. 
Let’s look at what the Supreme 
Court has said in circumstances that 
are closest to what we face today—in 
U.S. v. Nixon—in the context of a 
grand jury subpoena. The Supreme 
Court found that President Nixon’s

generalized assertion of privilege must 
yield to the demonstrated need for evi-
dence in the pending trial, and the Fed-
eral court here in DC has recognized 
that Congress’s need for information 
and for documents during an impeach-
ment inquiry is particularly compel-
ling. 
Turning to the facts of this matter 
briefly, any argument that every single 
document requested by Congress is sub-
ject to privilege or some form of abso-
lute immunity is absurd. There are cal-
endar invitations, scheduling emails, 
photographs, correspondence with out-
side parties like Rudolph Giuliani. 
These are all important pieces of evi-
dence for you to consider and are not 
the types of materials subject to any 
reasonable claim of executive privilege. 
If you want a fair trial, it should in-
volve documents. Given the nature of 
these proceedings, documents like Am-
bassador Bolton’s notes and Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman’s Presidential deci-
sion memo should also be provided to 
you so you can seek the truth, the 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Senator MORAN, my 
colleague from Kansas, and I send a 
question to the desk for counsel for the 
President. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question is for counsel for the 
President: 
What did Hunter Biden do for the money 
that Burisma holdings paid him? 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. Thank you for 
the question. 
Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, as far as 
we know, Hunter Biden has said he ‘‘at-
tended a couple of board meetings a 
year.’’ Here is what we do know: Hun-
ter Biden did attend one board meeting 
in Monaco. Now, we also heard that 
when 
Zlochevsky—the 
owner 
of 
Burisma—fled the Ukraine, he was liv-
ing in Monaco. So Hunter Biden did at-
tend a board meeting in Monaco. We 
also know that Hunter Biden went to 
Norway on a fishing trip, and he took 
his daughter and his nephew. So he 
took two of Joe Biden’s children with 
him on a fishing trip to Norway with 
Zlochevsky. That is as much as we 
know, other than his statement that he 
attended one or two board meetings. 
Factually, that is what he said, and 
the timeline shows that. Again, Devon 
Archer was on the board with him, and 
then Hunter Biden remained on the 
board. Factually, in the record, that is 
as much as we know that he did involv-
ing Burisma and Zlochevsky. 
The Norway trip was in June of 2015. 
He remained on the board until April of 
2019. We also know that, prior to then, 
a Ukrainian court in September of 2016 
canceled Zlochevsky’s arrest warrant. 
We also know, on December 15, Vice 
President 
Biden 
called 
President 
Poroshenko. 
Then, 
in 
mid-January 
2017, Burisma announced all legal pro-
ceedings against the company and 
Zlochevsky had been closed. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Demo-
cratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for both 
the counsel for the President and the 
House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator SCHU-
MER’s question reads as follows: 
The House Managers say the President de-
mands absolute immunity. The President’s 
counsel disputes this. Can either of you 
name a single witness or document to which 
the President has given access to the House 
when requested? 
I believe it is time for counsel for the 
President to go first. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I thank you and Minority Leader 
SCHUMER for the question. 
Let me try to be clear and distin-
guish a couple of things. 
The House managers have said there 
was blanket defiance. That is the way 
they characterized it—that we are not 
going to give you anything and that 
that is all we said. It was just a blan-
ket defiance. We are not going to re-
spond. 
What I have tried to explain several 
times is that that was not the Presi-
dent’s response. There were specifically 
articulated responses to different re-
quests based on different legal ration-
ales because there were different prob-
lems with different subpoenas. 
One problem is that all of the sub-
poenas up until October 31 were not 
validly authorized. So those subpoenas 
we said we were not going to respond 
to because they were not validly 
issued. It was not an assertion of exec-
utive privilege. It was not an assertion 
of absolute immunity. It wasn’t any-
thing else. It was the fact that they 
were not validly authorized. 
They pointed out that, aha, we sub-
poenaed—I think they mentioned—Act-
ing Chief of Staff Mulvaney after Octo-
ber 31. That is true, but we didn’t rely 
on the fact that the subpoena was not 
authorized. We pointed out the doc-
trine of the absolute immunity of sen-
ior advisers to the President. This is 
not some blanket absolute immunity 
for the entire executive branch. It 
doesn’t apply to all of the subpoenas 
they issued. As we explained in our 
brief, it applies to three. There were 
three people they subpoenaed as wit-
nesses that, on this basis alone, the 
President declined to make available— 
Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney, Legal 
Advisor to the National Security Coun-
cil John Eisenberg, and Deputy Na-
tional Security Adviser Kupperman, I 
believe, but it is in our brief. It was 
those three who had immunity—a doc-
trine asserted by every President since 
Nixon. 
Then there was a different problem 
with some of the subpoenas. As to some 
of the other witnesses who were not 
senior advisers to the President, the 
President did not assert that they had 
absolute immunity. Instead, those sub-
poenas refused to allow those executive 
branch personnel to have executive 
branch counsel accompany them. There 
is an OLC opinion that has been pub-
lished—it is online and cited in our 
trial memorandum—stating it is un-
constitutional to refuse to allow execu-
tive branch personnel to have the as-
sistance of executive branch counsel to 
protect privileged information during 
questioning, and, therefore, it is not 
valid to force them to appear without 
that counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Counsel. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, you know, we 
have received nothing as part of our 
impeachment inquiry. 
It is worth pointing out that the 
House committees that subpoenaed be-
fore the House vote had standing au-
thority under the House rules, and they 
were the Oversight Committee, which 
has the standard authority to inves-
tigate any matter at any time, as does 
the Foreign Affairs Committee. It has 
the authority, under the rules of the 
House, adopted January 11, to issue 
subpoenas. They did, and they were de-
fied. 
The idea of absolute immunity has 
never been upheld by any court, and it 
is really incomprehensible to think 
that somehow this concept of absolute 
immunity has lurked in hiding, for cen-
turies, for Presidents to use it in this 
day. When you think of the two cases— 
the Miers case and the McGahn case— 
the courts completely rejected the idea 
of absolute immunity. 
On the slide, there was a decision re-
cently made in the McGahn case, and 
here is what it reads: ‘‘Stated simply, 
the primary takeaway from the past 
250 years of recorded American history 
is that Presidents are not Kings . . . ’’ 
Those are the judge’s words, not mine. 
‘‘[C]ompulsory appearance by dint of a 
subpoena is a legal construct, not a po-
litical one, and per the Constitution, 
no one is above the law.’’ 
The President is not permitted by 
the Constitution or by the law to as-
sert any kind of absolute immunity. 
That does not exist in America, and as 
the judges pointed out, that would be 
something that a King would assert. I 
am not saying that, but I will say this. 
It is something our Founders set up our 
checks and balances to prevent. No-
body has absolute power in our system 
of government—not the Senate and 
House, not the President, not the judi-
ciary. This is unprecedented and just 
wrong as a matter of law and as a mat-
ter of the Constitution. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. PERDUE. Thank you, Mr. Chief 
Justice. 
I send a question to the desk for both 
the counsel to the President and the

to tell the Senate whether or not the so- 
called whistleblower had an actual conflict 
of interest? There are 7 billion people on 
planet earth; almost all had no involvement 
in Biden’s quid pro quo. Are the House Man-
agers unwilling to say whether the so-called 
whistleblower was a FACT WITNESS who di-
rectly participated in (and could face crimi-
nal or civil liability for) Joe Biden’s demand-
ing Ukraine fire the prosecutor who was in-
vestigating Burisma? And why did you refuse 
to transmit to the Senate the Inspector Gen-
eral’s transcript? 
It is addressed to both sides. I think, 
perhaps, the House managers should go 
first. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. With respect 
to the ICIG, the President and his al-
lies have tried to shift the focus to the 
inspector general of the intelligence 
community—a highly respected vet-
eran of the Justice Department—in his 
handling of the whistleblower’s com-
plaint. There was an effort to insinuate 
wrongdoing on the part of the whistle-
blower, and there has been an effort to 
insinuate wrongdoing on behalf of the 
inspector general. 
The briefings that we had with the 
ICIG related to the unusual and prob-
lematic handling of this particular 
whistleblower’s complaint within the 
executive branch, which diverts sharp-
ly from any prior whistleblower’s com-
plaint by anyone within the intel-
ligence community. The Intelligence 
Committee is continuing its ongoing 
oversight to determine why and how 
this complaint was initially concealed 
from the committee in violation of the 
law. 
ICIG Michael Atkinson continues to 
serve admirably and independently as 
he is supposed to do. 
Like the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee, the House Intelligence Com-
mittee does not release the transcripts 
of its engagements with inspectors gen-
eral on sensitive matters because doing 
so risks undercutting an important 
mechanism for the committee to con-
duct oversight. The transcripts remain 
properly classified, in conformity with 
IC requirements, to protect sensitive 
information. The ICIG made every ef-
fort to protect the whistleblower’s 
identity and briefed us with the expec-
tation that it would not be made pub-
lic, and we are trying to honor that ex-
pectation. 
With respect to allegations of bias on 
the part of the whistleblower, let me 
just refer you to the conclusion of the 
inspector general’s, which is, after ex-
amining the whistleblower, the whis-
tleblower’s background, any potential 
allegations of any bias, the whistle-
blower drew two conclusions: The whis-
tleblower was credible. Meaning, given 
whatever issue—perceived or real—the 
inspector general found that whistle-
blower to be credible. The inspector 
general also found that the whistle-
blower’s complaint was urgent and 
that it needed to be provided to Con-
gress. The inspector general further 
found that it was withheld from Con-
gress in violation of the law, in viola-
tion of the statute. For that, he is 
being attacked. 
Now, counsel for the President rely 
on an opinion of the Office of Legal 
Counsel as its justification for vio-
lating the Whistleblower Protection 
Act and not transmitting the com-
plaint to Congress. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the 
Senate. 
Page 5 of the inspector general’s re-
port states: ‘‘Although the inspector 
general’s preliminary review identified 
some indicia of an arguable political 
bias on the part of the Complainant—’’ 
now, that is in the actual statement. 
He goes on to say ‘‘—[involving] a rival 
political candidate, such evidence does 
not change his view about the credible 
nature of the concern,’’ or what ap-
pears to be credible; but to argue that 
it does not include an issue of political 
bias, the inspector general himself says 
that that is, in fact—at least he said 
the preliminary reviews indicate some 
political bias. 
Now, there have been reports in the 
media that the individual may have 
worked for Joe Biden when he was Vice 
President, that he may have had some 
area 
under 
his 
watch 
involving 
Ukraine. 
I also thought it was interesting that 
Manager SCHIFF just talked about the 
importance of how they control the 
process as it relates to a whistle-
blower’s reports because of the sen-
sitive nature of those. Do we not think 
that the sensitive nature of informa-
tion shared by the President’s most 
senior advisers should not be subject to 
the same type of protections? Of 
course, it has to be. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for both 
the President’s counsel and the House 
managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator MANCHIN reads as follows: 
The Framers took the words ‘‘high crimes 
and misdemeanors’’ straight out of English 
law, where it had been applied to impeach-
ments for 400 years before our Constitution 
was written. The Framers were well aware 
when they chose those words that Par-
liament had impeached officials for ‘‘high 
crimes and misdemeanors’’ that were not in-
dictable as crimes. The House has repeatedly 
impeached, and the Senate has convicted, of-
ficers for ‘‘high crimes and misdemeanors’’ 
that were not indictable crimes. Even Mr. 
Dershowitz said in 1998 that an impeachable 
offense ‘‘certainly doesn’t have to be a 
crime.’’ What has happened in the past 22 
years to change the original intent of the 
Framers and the historic meaning of the 
term ‘‘high crimes and misdemeanors?’’ 
It is counsel for the President’s turn. 
Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Senators, what happened since 
1998 is that I studied more, did more re-
search, read more documents, and like 
any academic, altered my views. That 
is what happens. That is what profes-
sors ought to do, and I keep reading 
more, and I keep writing more, and I 
keep refining my views. 
In 1998 the issue before this Senate 
was not whether a crime was required; 
it was whether the crime that Clinton 
was charged with was a high crime. 
When this impeachment began, the 
issue was whether a crime was re-
quired. 
Actually, 2 years earlier, in a book 
and then an op-ed, I concluded—not on 
partisan grounds—on completely aca-
demic grounds that you could not im-
peach for abuse of power and that tech-
nical crime was not required but crimi-
nal-like behavior was required. I stand 
by that view. 
The Framers rejected maladministra-
tion. That was the prime criteria for 
impeachment under British law. Re-
member, too, the British never im-
peached Prime Ministers. They only 
impeached middle-level and low-level 
people. 
So the Framers didn’t want to adopt 
the British approach. They rejected it 
by rejecting maladministration. And 
what is a metaphor or what is a syn-
onym for maladministration? Abuse of 
power. And when they rejected mal-
administration, they rejected abuse of 
power. 
Mr. Congressman SCHIFF asked a rhe-
torical question: Can a President en-
gage in abuse of power with impunity? 
In my tradition we answer questions 
with questions, and so I would throw 
the question back: Can a President en-
gage in maladministration with impu-
nity? 
That is a question you might have 
asked James Madison had you been at 
the Constitutional Convention. And he 
would say: No. A President can engage 
in that with impunity, but it is not an 
impeachable crime. Maladministration 
is not impeachable, and abuse of power 
is not impeachable. 
The issue is not whether a crime is 
required. The issue is whether abuse of 
power is a permissible constitutional 
criteria, and the answer from the his-
tory is clearly, unequivocally no. If 
that had ever been put to the Framers, 
they would have rejected it with the 
same certainty they rejected mal-
administration. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, it was 
always understood that the prime pur-
pose of impeachment was to deal with 
abuse of power. 
The first draft at the Constitutional 
Convention said ‘‘treason or bribery.’’ 
That was rejected because it wasn’t in-
clusive enough. 
Somebody put—Mason proposed mal-
administration. Found too vague—so 
they said ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors.’’ That was a well-under-
stood term in English law. It was a 
well-understood term in the Warren 
Hastings impeachment going on in 
England right then, and it meant, pri-
marily, abuse of power. That is the 
main meaning of high crimes and mis-
demeanors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S670 
January 29, 2020 
Charles Pinckney said those ‘‘who be-
have amiss or betray their public 
trust’’; 
Edmund 
Randolph, 
‘‘mis-
behaves’’; I quoted Justice Story the 
other 
day. 
Every 
impeachment 
in 
American history has been for abuse of 
power in one form or another. 
The idea that you have to have a 
crime—bribery is right there in the 
Constitution: 
‘‘Treason, 
Bribery 
or 
other . . . crimes.’’ Bribery was not 
made a statutory crime until 1837. So 
there couldn’t have been impeach-
ment? 
The fact of the matter is that crimes 
and impeachment are two different 
things. Impeachments are not punish-
ments for crimes. Impeachments are 
protections of the Republic against a 
President who would abuse his power, 
who would aggrandize power, who 
would threaten liberty, who would 
threaten the separation of powers, who 
would threaten the powers of the Con-
gress, who would try to arrogate power 
to himself. 
That is why punishment upon convic-
tion for impeachment only goes to re-
moval from office. You can’t put him 
in jail, as you could for a crime. You 
can’t fine him, as you could for a 
crime. 
They are two different things. An im-
peachable offense need not be a crime, 
and a crime need not be an impeach-
able offense—two completely different 
tests understood that way throughout 
American history and by all scholars— 
all scholars—in our history except for 
Mr. Dershowitz. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from North Carolina. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. Chief Justice, I send a 
question to the desk for counsel to the 
President. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator BURR 
asks: 
We have seen the House managers repeat-
edly play video clips of Acting Chief of Staff 
Mick Mulvaney’s press conference, in which 
they claim he said there was a quid pro quo. 
How do you respond to the House managers’ 
allegation that Mr. Mulvaney supported 
their claims in his press conference? 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, Sen-
ator, thanks for the question. 
We respond as Mr. Philbin did earlier 
today 
with 
that, 
which 
is 
Mr. 
Mulvaney has issued two statements— 
one after his press conference and then 
one Monday after the New York Times 
article concerning Mr. Bolton’s alleged 
manuscript—alleged statements in his 
manuscript. 
So I think the easiest thing is just to 
read them to understand what he said 
and to put it into context for everyone 
in the Chamber. 
This is from—this is the day of the 
press conference. 
Once again, the media has decided to mis-
construe my comments to advance a biased 
and political witch hunt against President 
Trump. Let me be clear, there was abso-
lutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian 
military aid and any investigation into the 
2016 election. The president never told me to 
withhold any money until the Ukrainians 
did anything related to the server. The only 
reasons we were holding the money was be-
cause of concern about lack of support from 
other nations and concerns over corruption. 
Multiple times during the more-than 30 
minute briefing where I took over 25 ques-
tions, I referred to President Trump’s inter-
est in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, and 
ensuring taxpayer dollars were spent respon-
sibly and appropriately. There was never any 
connection 
between 
the 
funds 
and 
the 
Ukrainians doing anything with the server— 
this was made explicitly obvious by the fact 
that the aid money was delivered without 
any action on the part of the Ukrainians re-
garding the server. 
There was never any condition on the flow 
of the aid related to the matter of the DNC 
server. 
Then, on January 27, which was Mon-
day, there was a statement from Bob 
Driscoll, who is Mr. Mulvaney’s attor-
ney. Now I will read it in its full. 
The latest story from the New York Times, 
coordinated with a book launch, has more to 
do with publicity than the truth. John 
Bolton never informed Mick Mulvaney of 
any concerns surrounding Bolton’s purported 
August conversation with the President. Nor 
did Mr. Mulvaney ever have a conversation 
with the President or anyone else indicating 
that Ukrainian military aid was withheld in 
exchange for a Ukrainian investigation of 
Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 election. 
Furthermore, Mr. Mulvaney has no recollec-
tion of any conversation with Mr. Giuliani 
resembling that reportedly described in Mr. 
Bolton’s 
manuscript, 
as 
it 
was 
Mr. 
Mulvaney’s practice to excuse himself from 
conversations between the President and his 
personal counsel to preserve any attorney- 
client privilege. 
So I wanted to read those statements 
in full so that everyone had the full 
context. 
Even after Mr. Philbin referenced the 
statement after the press conference, 
the House managers again came back 
and said Mr. Mulvaney indicated or ad-
mitted there was a quid pro quo. That 
is not true. 
If Mr. Mulvaney misspoke or if the 
words were garbled, he corrected it 
that day and has been very clear. 
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chief 
Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I send a question to the desk to the 
President’s counsel and the House 
managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator VAN 
HOLLEN’s question is to both parties 
and the House managers will go first: 
What did National Security Advisor John 
Bolton mean when he referenced ‘‘whatever 
drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cook-
ing up on this’’ and did he ever raise that 
issue in any meeting with President Trump? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, when John Bolton—and 
this is according to Dr. Hill’s testi-
mony—brought up the drug deal, it was 
in the context of a July 10 meeting at 
the White House. There were two meet-
ings that day. There was a meeting 
that Ambassador Bolton was present 
for, and then there was a follow-on 
meeting 
after 
Ambassador 
Bolton 
abruptly ended the first meeting. 
In the first meeting, the Ukrainians 
naturally wanted to raise the topic of 
getting the White House meeting that 
President 
Zelensky 
so 
desperately 
wanted. 
And after raising the issue, at some 
point Ambassador Sondland said: No, 
no, we have got a deal. They will get 
the meeting once they announce the 
investigations. 
And this is the point where Ambas-
sador Bolton stiffened. You can look up 
Dr. Hill’s exact words. I am para-
phrasing here. But this is the point 
where Ambassador Bolton stiffens and 
he ends the meeting. 
Hill then goes, follows Sondland and 
the delegation into another part of the 
White House where the meeting con-
tinues between the American delega-
tion and Ukrainian delegation, and 
there it is even more explicit, because 
in 
that 
second 
meeting, 
Sondland 
brings up the Bidens specifically. 
Hill then goes to talk to Bolton and 
informs him what has taken place in 
the following meeting, and Bolton’s re-
sponse is: Go talk to the lawyers, and 
let them know I don’t want to be part 
of this drug deal that Sondland and 
Mulvaney have got cooking up. 
So at that point, that specific con-
versation is a reference to the quid pro 
quo over the White House meeting. And 
we know, of course, from other docu-
ments, the testimony about the quid 
pro quo, about the White House meet-
ing, and all the efforts by Giuliani to 
make sure that the specific investiga-
tions aren’t mentioned in order to 
make this happen. 
But don’t take my word for it. We 
can bring in John Bolton and ask him 
exactly what he was referring to when 
he described the drug deal. 
Now, did Bolton describe and discuss 
this drug deal with the President? 
Well, it certainly appears from what we 
know about this manuscript that they 
did talk about the freeze on aid. 
And whether John Bolton understood 
and at what point he understood that 
the drug deal was even bigger and more 
pernicious than he thought, that it in-
volved not just a meeting but involved 
the military aid, there is one way to 
find out. 
And I would add this in terms of Mr. 
Mulvaney— 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. SCHIFF. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Maybe I will 
add it later. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Presi-
dent’s counsel has 21⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, Senator, 
for the question. 
The question asks about what Am-
bassador Bolton meant in a comment 
that is purported hearsay by someone 
else saying what he supposedly said. 
But what we know is that there are 
conflicting accounts of the July 10 
meeting at the White House. 
Dr. Hill says that she heard Ambas-
sador Sondland say one thing. He de-
nies that he said that. Dr. Hill says she

went and talked to Ambassador Bolton, 
and Bolton said something to her about 
what was said in the meeting where he 
wasn’t there, and he was saying some-
thing about it, calling it a drug deal. 
And what he meant by that—I am 
not going to speculate about it. It is a 
hearsay report of something he said 
about a meeting that he wasn’t in, 
characterized in some way, and I am 
not going to speculate about what he 
meant by that. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Thank you, Mr. Chief 
Justice. I have a question for myself 
and also for Senator PORTMAN and Sen-
ator BOOZMAN. It is for the President’s 
counsel, and I am sending it to the 
desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from the Senators is as follows: 
In September of 2019, the security assist-
ance aid was released to Ukraine. Yet, the 
House managers continue to argue that 
President Trump conditioned the aid on an 
investigation of the Bidens. Did the Ukrain-
ian President or his government ultimately 
meet any of the alleged requirements in 
order to receive the aid? 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief 
Justice. 
Thanks, Senator, for the question. 
The very short answer is no. I think 
that is fair. I think we demonstrated in 
our presentation on Friday and Mon-
day that the aid was released. The aid 
flowed. There was a meeting at the 
U.N. General Assembly. There was a 
meeting previously scheduled in War-
saw, precisely as President Zelensky 
suggested, and there was never any an-
nouncement of any investigations un-
dertaken 
regarding 
the 
Bidens, 
Burisma, the 2016 election, no state-
ments made, and no investigations an-
nounced or begun by the Ukrainian 
Government. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for the 
House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator WAR-
NER’s question is: 
Do you know about additional information 
related to Russia disseminating President 
Trump’s or Rudolph Giuliani’s conspiracy 
theories? Should the Senate have this infor-
mation before we deliberate on the Articles 
of Impeachment? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, I think there are three 
categories of relevant material here. 
The first, we do have access to, and 
that is the supplemental testimony of 
Jennifer Williams, and I would encour-
age you all to read it. I think it sheds 
light very specifically on the Vice 
President and what he may or may not 
know vis-a-vis this scheme. So I would 
encourage you to read that submission. 
There was a second body of intel-
ligence that the committees have been 
provided that is relevant to this trial 
that you should also read, and we 
should figure out the mechanism that 
would permit you to do so because it is 
directly relevant to the issues we are 
discussing and pertinent. 
There is a third category of intel-
ligence, too, which raises a very dif-
ferent problem, and that is that the in-
telligence communities are for the first 
time refusing to provide to the Intel-
ligence Committee. That material has 
been gathered. We know that it exists. 
But the NSA has been advised not to 
provide it. 
Now the Director says that this is 
the Director’s decision, but neverthe-
less there is a body of intelligence that 
is relevant to the requests that we 
have made that is not being provided. 
That raises a very different concern 
than the one before this body, and that 
is, are now other agencies like the in-
telligence community that we require 
to speak truth to power, that we re-
quire to provide us with the best intel-
ligence, now also withholding informa-
tion at the urging of the administra-
tion? That is, I think, a deeply con-
cerning and new phenomenon. That is a 
problem that we had previously with 
other Departments that have been part 
of the wholesale obstruction, but now 
it is rearing its ugly head with respect 
to the IC. 
But the shorter answer to the ques-
tion of, apart from Jennifer Williams, 
are there other relevant materials? The 
answer is yes, and I would encourage 
that you and we work together to find 
out how you might access them. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
the next two questions—one from each 
side—would be the last before we break 
for dinner. I would ask that following 
the next two questions, the Senate 
stand in recess for 45 minutes. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. I send a question to the 
desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator SHELBY’s question is di-
rected to counsel for the President: 
How does the noncriminal ‘‘abuse of 
power’’ standard advanced by the House 
Managers differ from ‘‘maladministration’’— 
an impeachment standard rejected by the 
Framers? Where is the line between such an 
‘‘abuse of power’’ and a policy disagreement? 
Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief 
Justice, I will address this. 
Senators, thank you very much for 
that question because that question I 
think hits the key to the issue that is 
before you today. 
When the Founders rejected mal-
administration—and recall that it was 
introduced by Mason and rejected by 
Madison on the ground that it would 
turn our new Republic into a par-
liamentary democracy where a Prime 
Minister—in this case, a President— 
can be removed at the pleasure of the 
legislature. 
Remember, too, that in Britain, im-
peachment was not used against the 
Prime Minister, and neither was a vote 
of no confidence; it was used against 
lower level people. 
So maladministration was introduced 
by Mason, and Madison said no, it was 
just too vague and too general. 
What is maladministration? If you 
look it up in the dictionary and you 
look up synonyms, the synonyms in-
clude abuse, corruption, misrule, dis-
honesty, misuse of office, and mis-
behavior. 
Even Professor Nikolas Bowie, a Har-
vard professor who was in favor of im-
peachment, so this is an admission 
against interest by him—he is in favor 
of impeachment—he says abuse of 
power is the same as misconduct in of-
fice, and he says that his research leads 
him to conclude that a crime is re-
quired. 
By the way, the Congressman was 
just completely wrong when he said I 
am the only scholar who supports this 
position. In the 19th century, which 
was closer in time to when the Framers 
wrote, Dean White of Columbia Law 
School wrote that ‘‘the weight of au-
thority’’—by 
which 
he 
meant 
the 
weight of scholarly authority and the 
weight of judicial authority—this was 
in 1867—‘‘the weight of authority is in 
favor of requiring a crime.’’ Justice 
Curtis came to the same conclusion. 
Others have come to a similar conclu-
sion. 
You ask what happened between 1998 
and the current time to change my 
mind. What happened between the 19th 
century and 20th century to change the 
minds of so many scholars? Let me tell 
you what happened. What happened is 
that the current President was im-
peached. 
If, in fact, President Obama or Presi-
dent Hillary Clinton would have been 
impeached, the weight of current schol-
arship would clearly be in favor of my 
position because these scholars do not 
pass the ‘‘shoe on the other foot’’ test. 
These scholars are influenced by their 
own bias, by their own politics, and 
their views should be taken with that 
in mind. They simply do not give objec-
tive assessments of the constitutional 
history. 
Professor Tribe suddenly had a rev-
elation himself. At the time Clinton 
was impeached, he said: Oh, the law is 
clear. You cannot—you cannot—charge 
a President with a crime while he is a 
sitting President. 
Now we have our current President. 
Professor Tribe got woke, and with no 
apparent new research, he came to the 
conclusion: Oh, but this President can 
be charged while sitting in office. 
That is not the kind of scholarship 
that should influence your decision. 
You can make your own decisions. 
Go back and read the debates, and you 
will see that I am right that the Fram-
ers rejected vague, open-ended cri-
teria—abuse of power. 
And what we had was the manager 
making a fundamental mistake again. 
She gave reasons why we have im-
peachment. Yes, we feared abuse of 
power. Yes, we feared criteria like mal-
administration. That was part of the 
reason. We feared incapacity. But none

of those made it into the criteria be-
cause the Framers had to strike a bal-
ance. Here are the reasons we need im-
peachment, yes. Now, here are the rea-
sons we fear giving Congress too much 
power. So we strike a balance. How did 
they strike it? Treason, a serious 
crime; bribery, a serious crime; or 
other high crimes and misdemeanors— 
crimes and misdemeanors akin to trea-
son and bribery. That is what the 
Framers intended. They didn’t intend 
to give Congress a license to decide 
whom to impeach and whom not to im-
peach on partisan grounds. 
I read you a list of 40 American 
Presidents who have been accused of 
abuse of power. Should every one of 
them have been impeached? Should 
every one of them have been removed 
from office? It is too vague a term. 
Reject my argument about crime. 
Reject it if you choose to. Do not reject 
my argument that abuse of power 
would destroy—destroy—the impeach-
ment criteria of the Constitution and 
turn it, in the words of one of the Sen-
ators at the Johnson trial, to make 
every Member of the Senate, every 
Member of Congress, be able to define 
it from within their own bosom. 
We heard from the other side that 
every Senator should decide whether 
you need proof beyond a reasonable 
doubt or proof by a preponderance. 
Now we hear that every Senator should 
decide on abuse of power. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
have a question on behalf of Senator 
MARKEY and myself, and I send it to 
the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question is as follows: 
Supreme Court Justice Byron White, in a 
concurring opinion in Nixon v. United States 
(1993), acknowledged that the Senate ‘‘has 
very wide discretion in specifying impeach-
ment trial procedures,’’ but stated that the 
Senate ‘‘would abuse its discretion’’ if it 
were to ‘‘insist on a procedure that could not 
be deemed a trial by reasonable judges.’’ If 
the Senate does not allow for additional evi-
dence and the testimony of key witnesses 
with 
firsthand 
knowledge 
of 
President 
Trump’s actions and intentions, would a 
‘‘reasonable 
judge’’ 
conclude 
these 
pro-
ceedings constitute a constitutionally fair 
trial? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I think the an-
swer is no. I don’t know that we need 
to look to the words of a prior Justice 
to tell us that a trial without witnesses 
is not really a trial. It is certainly not 
a fair trial. If the House moves forward 
with impeachment and it comes before 
the Senate and wants to call witnesses 
and wants to make its case and is told 
‘‘Thou shalt not call witnesses,’’ that is 
not a fair trial. 
I think the American people under-
stand that without reading the case 
law. They go to jury duty themselves 
every year, and they see that the first 
thing that takes place after a jury is 
sworn in is the government makes its 
opening statement, the defense makes 
theirs, and then begins the calling of 
witnesses. 
I do want to take this opportunity to 
respond to Professor Dershowitz’ argu-
ments while they are fresh. You can 
say 
a 
lot 
of 
things 
about 
Alan 
Dershowitz, but you cannot say he is 
unprepared. 
He 
is 
not 
unprepared 
today. He was not unprepared 21 years 
ago. And to believe that he would not 
have read 21 years ago what Mason had 
to say or Madison had to say or Ham-
ilton had to say—I am sorry, I don’t 
buy that. I think 21 years ago he under-
stood that maladministration was re-
jected but so was a provision that con-
fined the impeachable offenses to trea-
son and bribery alone was rejected. 
I think the Alan Dershowitz from 21 
years ago understood that, yes, while 
you can’t impeach for a policy dif-
ference, you can impeach a President 
for abuse of power. That is what he 
said 21 years ago. Nothing has changed 
since then. 
I don’t think you can write off the 
consensus of constitutional opinion by 
saying they are all Never Trumpers. 
All the constitutional law professors— 
in fact, let’s play a snippet from Pro-
fessor Turley, who was in the House de-
fending the President, and see what he 
had to say recently. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Professor TURLEY. Abuse of power, in my 
view, is clear. You can impeach a President 
for abuse of power and you can impeach a 
President for noncriminal conduct. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. We can’t argue 
plausibly that his position is owing to 
some political bias, right? Just a few 
weeks ago, he was in the House arguing 
a case for my GOP colleagues that the 
President shouldn’t be impeached. 
Now, he did say: Well, if you can ac-
tually prove these things, if you can 
prove—as, indeed, we have—that the 
President abused his power by condi-
tioning military aid to help his reelec-
tion campaign, yes, that is an abuse of 
power. You can impeach with that kind 
of abuse of power, and that is exactly 
what we have here. 
We are not required to leave our com-
mon sense at the door. If we are to in-
terpret the Constitution now as saying 
that a President can abuse their 
power—and I think the professor sug-
gested before the break that he can 
abuse his power in a corrupt way to 
help his reelection and you can’t do 
anything about it—you can’t do any-
thing about it because if he views it as 
in his personal interest, that is just 
fine. He is allowed to do it. 
None of the Founders would have ac-
cepted that kind of reasoning. In fact, 
the idea that the core offense that the 
Founders protected against—that core 
offense is abuse of power—is beyond 
the reach of Congress through im-
peachment would have terrified the 
Founders. I mean, you can imagine any 
number of abuses of power—a President 
who withholds aid from another coun-
try at war as a thank you for that ad-
versary allowing him to build a Trump 
Tower in a country. OK, that may not 
be criminal, but are we really going to 
say that we are going to have to permit 
a President of the United States to 
withhold military aid as a thank you 
for a business proposition? 
Now, counsel acknowledges that a 
crime is not necessary but something 
akin to a crime. Well, we think there is 
a crime here of bribery or extortion— 
conditioning official acts for personal 
favors. That is bribery. It is also what 
the Founders understood as extortion. 
And you cannot argue—even if you 
argue, well, under the modern defini-
tion of bribery, you have got to show 
such and such—you cannot plausibly 
argue that it is not akin to bribery. It 
is bribery. But it is certainly akin to 
bribery. 
That is the import of what they 
would argue—that, no, the President 
has a constitutional right. Under arti-
cle II, he can do anything he wants. He 
can abuse his office and do so sacri-
ficing national security, undermining 
the integrity of the elections, and 
there is nothing Congress can do about 
it. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
RECESS 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. We are in re-
cess. 
There being no objection, at 6:32 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 7:25 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will come to order. 
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Arizona. 
Ms. MCSALLY. I send a question to 
the desk on behalf of myself and Sen-
ators SCOTT of Florida, HAWLEY, and 
HOEVEN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question is for counsel for the 
President from Senator MCSALLY, Sen-
ator 
SCOTT
from 
Florida, 
Senator 
HAWLEY, and Senator HOEVEN: 
Chairman SCHIFF
just argued that ‘‘we 
think there’s a crime here of bribery or ex-
tortion,’’ or ‘‘something akin to bribery.’’ Do 
the articles of impeachment charge the 
President with bribery, extortion, or any-
thing akin to it? Do they allege facts suffi-
cient to prove either crime? If not, are the 
House Managers’ discussion of crimes they 
neither alleged nor proved appropriate in 
this proceeding? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
No, the Articles of Impeachment do 
not charge the crime of bribery, extor-
tion, or any other crime. And that is a 
critical point because, as the Supreme 
Court has explained, ‘‘No principle of 
procedural due process is more clearly 
established than that of notice of the 
specific charge, and a chance to be 
heard in a trial of the issues raised by 
that charge . . . are among the con-
stitutional rights of every accused.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S673 
January 29, 2020 
That was the Supreme Court in Cole v. 
Arkansas. 
The Court has also explained that for 
over 130 years, a court cannot permit— 
it has been the rule that ‘‘a court can-
not permit the defendant to be tried on 
charges that are not made in the in-
dictment against him.’’ That is the 
rule in criminal law, and it is also the 
case for impeachments. 
It is the House’s responsibility to 
make an accusation and a specific ac-
cusation in Articles of Impeachment. 
The House had the opportunity to do 
that, and they did that. The charges 
that they put in the articles were 
abuse of power on a vague standard 
that they made up and obstruction of 
Congress. They put some discussion 
about other things in a House Judici-
ary Committee report, but they did not 
put that in the Articles of Impeach-
ment. 
And if this were a criminal trial in an 
ordinary court and Mr. SCHIFF
had 
done what he just did on the floor here 
and start talking about crimes of brib-
ery and extortion that were not in the 
indictment, it would have been an 
automatic mistrial. We would all be 
done now, and we could go home. Mr. 
SCHIFF
knows that because he is a 
former prosecutor. 
It is not permissible for the House to 
come here, failing to have charged— 
failing to have put in Articles of Im-
peachment any crime at all, and then 
to start arguing that, actually, oh, we 
think there is some crime involved, 
and, actually, we think we actually 
proved it, even though we provided no 
notice we were going to try to prove 
that. 
It is totally impermissible. It is a 
fundamental violation of due process. 
Scholars have pointed out those rules 
apply equally in cases of impeachment. 
Charles Black and Philip Bobbitt ex-
plained in their work ‘‘Impeachment: A 
Handbook’’ that is regarded as one of 
the authorities—collecting sources of 
authority on impeachments: 
The senator’s role is solely one of acting 
on the accusations (Articles of Impeach-
ment) voted by the House of Representa-
tives. The Senate cannot lawfully find the 
president guilty of something not charged by 
the House, any more than a trial jury can 
find the defendant guilty of something not 
charged in the indictment. 
So what Manager SCHIFF
just at-
tempted here was totally improper. It 
would have resulted in a mistrial in 
any court in this country. There is 
nothing that has been introduced in 
the facts that would satisfy the ele-
ments of the crime of extortion or brib-
ery either. 
To 
attempt—after 
making 
their 
opening, after not charging anything in 
the articles that is a crime, after not 
specifying any crime, after providing 
no notice that they are going to at-
tempt to argue a crime—in the ques-
tion-and-answer session, to try to 
change the charges that they have 
made against the President of the 
United States and to say that actually 
there is bribery and extortion is totally 
unacceptable. It is not permissible, and 
this body should not consider those ar-
guments. They are not permissible 
bounds for argument. They are not in-
cluded in the Articles of Impeachment, 
and they should be ignored. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. UDALL. Thank you for the rec-
ognition, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Chief 
Justice, I have sent a question to the 
desk. I am joined in this question by 
Senators 
BLUMENTHAL, 
LEAHY, 
and 
WHITEHOUSE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator UDALL, 
joined 
by 
Senators 
BLUMENTHAL, 
LEAHY, and WHITEHOUSE, to the House 
managers: 
The President’s counsel has argued that 
Hunter Biden’s involvement with Burisma 
created a conflict of interest for his father 
Joe Biden. President Trump, the Trump or-
ganization, and his family, including those 
who serve in the White House, maintain sig-
nificant business interests in foreign coun-
tries and benefit from foreign payments and 
investments. By the standard the President’s 
counsel has applied to Hunter Biden, should 
Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump’s conflicts of in-
terest with foreign governments also come 
under investigation? 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief 
Justice, and to the Senators, thank 
you so much for that question. Let me 
just preface what I am about to say 
with this statement: This has been a 
tough few days. It has been a trying 
time for each of us and for our Nation. 
But I just want to say this in re-
sponse to the question that has been 
posed. I stand before you as the mother 
of three sons. I am sure that many of 
you in this Chamber have children— 
sons and daughters—and grandchildren 
that you think the world of. My chil-
dren’s last name is Demings. So, when 
they go out to get a job, I wonder if 
there are people who associate my sons 
with their mother and their father. 
I just believe, as we go through this 
very tough, very difficult debate about 
whether to impeach and remove the 
President of the United States, that we 
stay focused. The last few days we have 
seen many distractions. Many things 
have been said to take our minds off of 
the truth, off of why we are really here. 
In my former line of work, I used to 
call it working with smoke and mir-
rors, anything that will take your at-
tention off of what is painfully obvious, 
what is there in plain view. 
The reason why we are here has noth-
ing to do with anybody’s children, as 
we have talked about. The reason why 
we are here is because the President of 
the United States, the 45th President, 
used the power of his office to try to 
shake down—I will use that term be-
cause I am familiar with it—a foreign 
power to interfere into this year’s elec-
tion. In other words, the President of 
the United States tried to cheat and 
then tried to get this foreign power, 
this newly elected President, to spread 
a false narrative that we know is un-
true about interference in our election. 
That is why we are here. And it real-
ly would help, I believe, the situation if 
the Attorney General, perhaps—the De-
partment of Justice has been pretty si-
lent—would issue a ruling or an opin-
ion about any person of authority, es-
pecially the President of the United 
States, using or abusing that authority 
to invite other powers into interfering 
in our election. 
So, Mr. Chief Justice, I will just close 
my remarks as I began them. Let us 
stay focused. This doesn’t have any-
thing to do with the President’s chil-
dren or the Bidens’ children. This is 
about the President’s wrongdoing. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. Chief Justice, on be-
half of myself and Senators RISCH, 
CRUZ, GRAHAM, BRAUN, MORAN, and 
BOOZMAN, I send a question to the desk 
for the counsel for the President. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator CRAPO and the other Sen-
ators for the counsel for the President: 
Does the evidence in the record show that 
an investigation into the Burisma-Biden 
matter is in the national interest of the 
United States and its efforts to stop corrup-
tion? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. And the straightforward an-
swer is, yes, the evidence does show 
that it would be in the interest of the 
United States. In fact, the evidence on 
that point is abundant. 
Here is what we know: Hunter Biden 
was appointed to the board of an en-
ergy company in Ukraine without any 
apparent experience that would qualify 
him for that position. He was ap-
pointed shortly after his father, the 
Vice President, became the Obama ad-
ministration’s point man for policy on 
Ukraine. 
We know that his appointment raised 
several red flags at the time. Chris 
Heinz, the stepson of the then-Sec-
retary of State, severed his business re-
lationship with Hunter citing Hunter’s 
lack of judgment in joining the board 
of that company, Burisma, because 
Burisma was owned by an oligarch who 
was repeatedly under investigation for 
corruption, for money laundering, and 
other offenses. 
Contemporaneous press reports spec-
ulated that Hunter’s role with Burisma 
might undermine U.S. efforts led by his 
father then, at that time, to promote 
the U.S. anticorruption message in 
Ukraine. 
The Washington Post said: ‘‘The ap-
pointment of the Vice President’s son 
to 
a 
Ukrainian 
oil 
board 
looks 
nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst.’’ 
There were other articles. There was 
one that reported: ‘‘The credibility of 
the United States was not helped by 
the news that . . . Hunter had been on 
the board of the directors of Burisma.’’ 
There was another article saying: 
‘‘Sadly, the credibility of Mr. Biden’s

message may be undermined by the as-
sociation of his son with a Ukrainian 
natural-gas company, Burisma Hold-
ings, which is owned by a former gov-
ernment official suspected of corrupt 
practices.’’ 
And it went on: Reports from the 
Wall Street Journal said that activists 
here—that is, in the Ukraine—say that 
the U.S.’s anti-corruption message is 
being undermined as his son receives 
money from a former Ukrainian offi-
cial who is being investigated for graft. 
At the same time, within the Obama 
administration, officials raised ques-
tions. The Special Envoy for Energy 
Policy, Amos Hochstein, raised the 
matter with the Vice President. Simi-
larly, Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
State Kent testified that he, too, 
voiced concerns with Vice President 
Biden’s office. 
Everyone who was asked in the pro-
ceedings before the House of Represent-
atives agreed that there was at least an 
appearance of a conflict of interest 
when Mr. Biden’s son was appointed to 
the board of this company. That in-
cluded Ambassador Yovanovitch, Dep-
uty Assistant Secretary Kent, Lieuten-
ant Colonel Vindman, Jennifer Wil-
liams, Ambassador Sondland, Dr. Fiona 
Hill, and Ambassador Taylor. They all 
agreed there was an appearance of a 
conflict of interest. 
Even in the transcript of the July 25 
telephone 
call, 
President 
Zelensky 
himself acknowledged the connection 
between the Biden and Burisma inci-
dent, the firing of the prosecutor who 
reportedly 
had 
been 
looking 
into 
Burisma, when Vice President Biden 
openly acknowledged he leveraged a 
billion dollars in U.S. loan guarantees 
to make sure that that particular pros-
ecutor was fired. He openly acknowl-
edged it was an explicit quid pro quo: 
You don’t get a billion dollars in loan 
guarantees unless and until that pros-
ecutor is fired. My plane is leaving in 6 
hours, he said on the tape. 
And when the President, President 
Trump, raised this in the July 25 call, 
President Zelensky recognized that 
this related to corruption, and he said: 
‘‘The issue of the investigation of the 
case’’—and he’s referring to the case of 
Burisma—‘‘is actually the issue of 
making sure to restore the honesty, so 
we will take care of that . . .’’ And he 
later said in an interview that he rec-
ognized that President Trump had been 
saying to him things are corrupt in 
Ukraine, and he was trying to explain, 
no, we are going to change that; there 
is not going to be corruption. 
So that explicit exchange in the July 
25 call shows that President Zelensky 
recognized that that Biden-Burisma in-
cident had an impact on corruption and 
anti-corruption. And so it was defi-
nitely undermining the U.S. message 
on anti-corruption, and it was a per-
fectly legitimate issue for the Presi-
dent to raise with President Zelensky 
to make clear that the United States 
did not condone anything that would 
seem to interfere with legitimate in-
vestigations and to enforce the proper 
anti-corruption message. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator DURBIN’s question is directed 
to the House managers: 
Would you please respond to the answer 
that was just given by the President’s coun-
sel? 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. 
Chief Justice, Senators, the President 
sought Ukraine’s help in investigating 
the Bidens only after reports suggested 
Vice President Biden might enter the 
2020 Presidential race and would seri-
ously challenge President Trump in the 
polls. President Trump had no interest 
in Biden’s Obama-era Ukraine work in 
2017 or 2018 when Biden was not run-
ning against him for President. 
None of the 17 witnesses in the im-
peachment inquiry provided any cred-
ible evidence—no credible evidence—to 
support the allegation that former Vice 
President Biden acted inappropriately 
in any way in Ukraine. Instead, wit-
nesses testified that the former Vice 
President was carrying out official U.S. 
policy in coordination with the inter-
national community when he advo-
cated for the ouster of a corrupt 
Ukrainian official. 
In short, the allegations are simply 
unfounded. 
President 
Trump’s 
own 
handpicked special envoy to Ukraine, 
Ambassador Kurt Volker, knew they 
were unfounded too. He testified that 
he confronted the President’s attorney, 
Mr. Giuliani, about these conspiracy 
theories and told him that ‘‘it is sim-
ply not credible to me that Joe Biden 
would be influenced in his duties as 
Vice President by money or things for 
his son or anything like that. I’ve 
known him a long time. He’s a person 
of integrity, and that is not credible.’’ 
Giuliani acknowledged that he did 
not find one of the sources of these al-
legations, a former Ukrainian pros-
ecutor, to be held credible. So even 
Giuliani knew the allegations were 
false. 
Our own Justice Department con-
firmed that the President never spoke 
to the Attorney General about Ukraine 
or any investigation into Vice Presi-
dent Biden. If President Trump genu-
inely believed that there was a legiti-
mate basis to request Ukraine’s assist-
ance in law enforcement investiga-
tions, there are specific formal proc-
esses that he should have followed. 
Specifically, he could have asked the 
DOJ to make an official request for as-
sistance through the mutual legal as-
sistance treaty. 
It is worth noting, the President only 
cares about Hunter Biden to the extent 
that he is the Vice President’s son and, 
therefore, a means through which to 
smear a political opponent. But Presi-
dent 
Trump 
specifically 
mentioned 
Vice President Biden in asking for the 
removal of the former prosecutor on 
that July 25 call. That is what he want-
ed, not an investigation into Hunter 
Biden. This is yet another reason you 
know that there is no basis for inves-
tigating Vice President Biden. 
Can we get slide 52 up? 
The timing shows clearly that de-
spite the fact that this conduct oc-
curred in 2015, it wasn’t until Vice 
President Biden began consistently 
beating Trump in national polls in the 
spring of 2019 by significant margins 
that the President targeted Biden. He 
was scared of losing. The President 
wanted to cast a cloud over a formi-
dable political opponent. This wasn’t 
about any genuine concern of wrong-
doing. The evidence proves that. This 
was solely about the President wanting 
to make sure that he could do what-
ever it took to make sure that he could 
win. So he froze the critical money to 
Ukraine to coerce Ukraine to help him 
attack his political opponent and se-
cure his reelection. 
The President of the United States 
cannot use our taxpayer dollars to 
pressure a foreign government to do his 
personal bidding. No one is above the 
law. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from South Carolina. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Thank 
you, sir. 
I send a question to the desk on be-
half of myself, Senators CRAPO
and 
GRAHAM, for the White House counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is 
from Senator SCOTT of South Carolina 
and other Senators to the White House 
counsel: 
House managers claim that the Biden/ 
Burisma affair has been debunked. What 
agency within the government or inde-
pendent investigation led to the debunking? 
Mr. 
Counsel 
HERSCHMANN. 
Mr. 
Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, 
there is no evidence in the record about 
any investigation, let alone debunked, 
shammed, discredited, or, as Manager 
JEFFRIES told you tonight, phony. 
The House managers haven’t cited 
any evidence in the record because 
none exists. A couple of days ago, I 
read to you a quote and statement 
from Vice President Biden dealing with 
corruption in Ukraine. What I didn’t 
tell you was he made those statements 
before the Ukrainian Parliament di-
rectly. 
He spoke about the historic battle of 
corruption. He spoke about fighting 
corruption, specifically in the energy 
sector. He spoke about no sweetheart 
deals. 
He 
said 
oligarchs 
and 
nonoligarchs must play by the same 
rules: 
Corruption siphons away resources from 
the people. It blunts economic growth, and it 
affronts the human dignity. 
Those were Vice President Biden’s 
words. So the real question is this. Is 
corruption related to the energy sector 
in Ukraine run by a corrupt Ukrainian 
oligarch who is paying our Vice Presi-
dent’s son and his son’s business part-
ner millions of dollars for no apparent

legitimate reason while his father was 
overseeing our country’s relationship 
with Ukraine merit any public inquiry, 
investigation, or interest? The answer 
is yes. 
Simply saying it didn’t happen is ri-
diculous. With all due respect to the 
House managers and citing to our chil-
dren, the message to our children, espe-
cially when you oversee a corruption in 
trying to root it out in another coun-
try, is to make sure your children 
aren’t benefiting from it. That is what 
should be happening—not to sit there 
and say that it is OK. 
The House managers don’t deny that 
there is a legitimate reason to do an 
investigation. They just say it was de-
bunked; it is a sham; it is delegitimate; 
but they don’t tell you when it hap-
pened. 
We all remember the email that 
Chris Heinz sent. Keep this in mind. He 
is the stepson of the then-Secretary of 
State, John Kerry. He sends an official 
email to the State Department, to the 
chief of staff to John Kerry, and special 
assistant. 
The 
subject is Ukraine. 
There is no question when you look at 
that email that it is a warning shot to 
say: I don’t know what they are doing, 
but we are not invested in it. 
He is taking a giant step back. 
Think about the words, and remem-
ber the video that we saw about Hunter 
Biden. What did he say? I am not going 
to ‘‘open my kimono’’—I am not going 
to ‘‘open my kimono’’—when he was 
asked how much money he was mak-
ing. In one month—in one month 
alone—Hunter Biden and his partner 
made almost as much as every Senator 
and Congressman—just in one month 
alone—what you earn in a year. And 
you don’t think that merits inquiry? 
Does anyone here think, when they 
say it is a debunked investigation that 
didn’t happen, that we wouldn’t re-
member if there was testimony of Hun-
ter Biden, Joe Biden, Secretary of 
State John Kerry, his stepson, their 
business partner, his chief of staff, and 
special assistant? How can you tell the 
American people it doesn’t merit in-
quiry when our Vice President’s son is 
supposedly doing this for corporate 
transparency in Ukraine? He is going 
to oversee the legal department of a 
Ukrainian company; he is going to help 
them. 
And if you look at his statement that 
I read to you beforehand, there is an-
other part of it from October 2019. If 
you want to know whether he thought 
it dealt with outside of Ukraine in just 
Burisma—he said he was ‘‘advising 
Burisma on its corporate reform initia-
tives, an important aspect of fueling 
Burisma’s international growth and di-
versity.’’ 
Listen to this statement by Hunter 
Biden’s attorney: ‘‘Vibrant energy pro-
duction, particularly natural gas, was 
central to Ukraine’s independence and 
to stemming the tide of Vladimir 
Putin’s attack on the principles of a 
democratic Europe.’’ 
Do you think he understood, when he 
was getting the millions of dollars, 
what his father was doing? The only 
problem is, that statement didn’t come 
out until October of 2019. Only when 
the news stories started to break, only 
when the House managers raised these 
issues, did people start to talk about it. 
Tell us where we saw Joe Biden, Hun-
ter Biden, and John Kerry testify about 
it. Tell us where you did it when you 
did your impeachment hearings. I don’t 
remember seeing that testimony. I 
don’t 
remember 
seeing 
the 
bank 
records. We put the bank records in 
front of you. The people are entitled to 
know exactly what was going on. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. 
Chief Justice. 
On behalf of the Senator from New 
Mexico, MARTIN HEINRICH, and myself, 
I have a question to send to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator MERKLEY and other Sen-
ators is for counsel to the President: 
Please clarify your previous answer about 
the Bolton manuscript. When, exactly, did 
the first person on the President’s defense 
team first learn of the allegations in the 
manuscript? Secondly, Mr. Bolton’s lawyer 
publicly disputes that any information in 
the manuscript could reasonably be consid-
ered classified. Was the determination to 
block its publication on the basis that it 
contains classified information made solely 
by career officials, or were political ap-
pointees in the White House Counsel’s office, 
or elsewhere in the White House, involved? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, to address your ques-
tion specifically, the allegation that 
came out in the New York Times arti-
cle about a conversation that is alleg-
edly reported in the manuscript be-
tween the President and Ambassador 
Bolton and officials, lawyers in the 
White House Counsel’s Office learned 
about that allegation for the first time 
on Sunday afternoon when the White 
House was contacted by the New York 
Times. 
In terms of the classification review, 
it is conducted at the NSC. The White 
House Counsel’s Office is not involved 
in classification review, determining 
what is classified or not classified. 
I can’t state the specifics. My under-
standing is that it is conducted by ca-
reer officials at the NSC, but it is han-
dled by the NSC. I am not in a position 
to give you full information on that. 
My understanding is, it is being done 
by career officials. But it is not being 
done by lawyers in the White House 
Counsel’s Office. 
I hope that answers your question, 
Senator. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself and Senator LANKFORD for the 
President’s counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators SUL-
LIVAN and LANKFORD to the counsel for 
the President: 
There 
has 
been 
conflicting 
testimony 
about how long the Senate might be tied up 
in obtaining additional evidence. At the be-
ginning of this trial, the minority leader of-
fered 11 amendments to obtain additional 
evidence in the form of documents and depo-
sitions from several federal agencies. If the 
Senate had adopted all 11 of these amend-
ments, how long do you think this impeach-
ment trial would take? 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, it 
would take a long time. It would take 
a long time just to get through those 
motions. 
But there have been 17 witnesses. We 
are talking about, now, additional wit-
nesses that the managers have put for-
ward and that Democratic Leader 
SCHUMER
has discussed. He has dis-
cussed four witnesses in particular, as 
if this body—if it were to grant wit-
nesses—would say: Yes, you get those 
four witnesses. And the White House 
and the President’s counsel get what? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Whatever you want. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Whatever I 
want. That is what you said, Mr. SCHU-
MER. 
Whatever I want? Here’s what I want. 
I want ADAM SCHIFF. I want Hunter 
Biden. I want Joe Biden. I want the 
whistleblower. I want to also under-
stand there may be additional people 
within the House Intelligence Com-
mittee that have had conversations 
with that whistleblower—that I get 
anybody we want. By the way, if we get 
anybody we want, we will be here for a 
very long time. 
The fact of the matter is, we are not 
here to argue witnesses tonight, which, 
obviously, is an undercurrent. But to 
say that this is not going to extend 
this proceeding—months, because un-
derstand something else: Despite the, 
you know, executive privilege and 
other nonsense, I suspect Manager 
SCHIFF—smart guy—he is going to say: 
Wait a minute, I have some speech and 
debate privileges that may be applica-
ble to this. 
I am not saying that they are. But 
they may raise it. It would be legiti-
mate to raise it. So this is a process 
that we would be—this would be the 
first of many weeks. 
I think we have to be clear. They put 
this forward in an aggressive and fast- 
paced way, and now they are saying 
‘‘Now we need witnesses’’—after 31 or 
32 times you said you proved every as-
pect of your case. That is what you 
said. 
He just said he did. Well, then, I 
don’t think we need any witnesses. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk and refer it 
to the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is 
from Senator MENENDEZ to the House 
managers: 
President Trump has maintained that he 
withheld U.S. security assistance to Ukraine 
because he was concerned about corruption.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S676 
January 29, 2020 
Yet, his purported concern about corruption 
did not prevent his Administration from 
sending congressionally-appropriated assist-
ance to Ukraine more than 45 times between 
January 2017 and June 2019, totaling more 
than $1.5 billion. So why did the President 
suddenly become concerned about corruption 
in early 2019? 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
He became concerned about corrup-
tion supposedly in early 2019 because 
Vice President Biden was running for 
election for the Presidency. That is 
what the overwhelming amount of the 
evidence shows because there is no 
other legitimate reason, as your ques-
tion points out. 
First, the publicly released records of 
President Trump’s April 21 and 25 calls 
to President Zelensky never mentioned 
the word ‘‘corruption’’ despite the fact 
that the talking points for these calls 
prepared by his own staff listed ‘‘cor-
ruption.’’ 
Second, in May 2019, the State De-
partment certified to Congress Ukraine 
had ‘‘taken substantial actions for the 
purposes of decreasing corruption’’ and 
met the anti-corruption benchmarks 
this very body established when it ap-
propriated $250 million of those funds. 
Third, by the time of the July 25 call, 
President Zelensky had already estab-
lished his anti-corruption bona fides, 
having introduced a number of reform 
bills in Ukraine. 
Fourth, on July 26, the day after his 
call with President Zelensky, President 
Trump spoke to Ambassador Sondland, 
who was in Ukraine. The one question 
the 
President 
asked 
Ambassador 
Sondland was not about corruption but 
about 
whether 
or 
not 
President 
Zelensky was going to do the investiga-
tions. 
Fifth, the released aid—as your ques-
tion points out, Senator, the President 
released the aid in 2017 and in 2018, and 
he released it in 2019 only after having 
gotten caught. In the words of Lieuten-
ant Colonel Vindman and other wit-
nesses, the conditions on the ground 
had not changed. 
So we are hearing a lot tonight about 
the 
concerns 
about 
corruption, 
Burisma, Russia, but the facts still 
matter here. We are here for one reason 
and one reason only: The President of 
the United States withheld foreign aid 
that he was happy to give in the 2 prior 
years; that suddenly, we are to believe, 
something changed, the conditions on 
the ground changed, and he had an 
epiphany about corruption within a 
week of Vice President Biden announc-
ing his candidacy. It doesn’t make any 
sense. 
One other thing I will say with re-
gard to the aid is, this assertion that 
President Trump has been the strong-
est supporter of Ukraine—I talked 
about this earlier. Let’s just assume 
that to be the case, and if it is the case, 
as the President’s counsel has con-
tended over and over again, then there 
is, of course, no reason to withhold the 
aid, because nothing has changed. 
This leads us inevitably to only one 
conclusion, and that is that the Presi-
dent of the United States used tax-
payer dollars—the American people’s 
money—to withhold aid from an ally at 
war to benefit his political campaign. 
Do not be distracted by Russian prop-
aganda, by conspiracy theories, by peo-
ple asking you to look in other direc-
tions. That is what this is about. That 
will not change. The facts will con-
tinue to come out. Whether this body 
subpoenas them or not, the facts will 
come out. The question now is, Will 
they come out in time, and will you be 
the ones asking for them when you are 
going to be making the decision in a 
couple of days to sit in judgment? 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for the 
President’s counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question is from Senator JOHN-
SON for the President’s counsel: 
If House Managers were certain it would 
take months to litigate a subpoena for John 
Bolton, why shouldn’t the Senate assume 
lengthy litigation and make the same deci-
sion as the House made—reject a subpoena 
for John Bolton? 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, I 
think that is precisely the point. And 
the fact is that if, in fact, we are to go 
down that road of a witness or wit-
nesses that had national—in the case of 
Ambassador 
Bolton, 
high-ranking 
NSA—this is an individual that is giv-
ing the President advice at the highest 
level. The Supreme Court has been 
very consistent on that. That is where 
privileges are at their highest level. 
The presumed privilege, actually, is 
what the Supreme Court has said. 
And in a situation like this, I think 
we are going down a road—if the Sen-
ate goes down this road—of a lengthy 
proceeding with a lot more witnesses. 
And then I want to ask this question 
and just plant it as a thought: Is that 
going to be the new norm for impeach-
ment? You put an impeachment to-
gether in a couple of weeks. We don’t 
like what the President did. We get it 
through in a 2-day proceeding in front 
of the Judiciary Committee. We wrap 
it up and we send it up here and say: 
Now go figure it out. Because that is 
what this is really becoming. That is 
what this actually is. 
So I think, if we are looking at the 
institutional interests that are at 
stake here, this is a very dangerous 
precedent 
because 
what 
they 
are 
doing—what they are saying is basi-
cally: We have enough to prove our 
case—that is what Manager Schiff 
says—but not really, so we really need 
more evidence—not because we need it; 
because we want it. But we didn’t want 
it bad enough when we were in the 
House, so we didn’t get it. So now you 
issue the subpoena, and then let’s duke 
it out in court and see what happens. 
It sounds like, to me, that this is— 
they are acting like this is some mu-
nicipal traffic court proceeding. I re-
mind everybody that we are talking 
about—under their Articles of Im-
peachment, they are requesting the re-
moval of the President of the United 
States. So, you know, they are already 
saying in the media that their ongoing 
investigation here—they are going to 
continue to investigate. So are we 
going to be doing this every 3 weeks, 
every month except in the summer? 
There is an election months away. The 
people should have a right to vote. My 
colleague Pat Cipollone, the White 
House counsel, said that. 
So when I look at all of this, whether 
it is the late need of witnesses after 
you prove your case, whether privileges 
apply or not apply—Senator SCHUMER 
said: We get anybody we want—we 
would be here for a very, very long 
time, and that is not good for the 
United States. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I have a question for 
the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator SCHU-
MER’s question is for the House man-
agers: 
Would you please respond to the answer 
that was just given by the President’s coun-
sel? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I think we can 
all see what is going on here, and that 
is, if the House wants to call witnesses, 
if you want to hear from a single wit-
ness, if you want to hear what John 
Bolton has to say, we are going to 
make this endless. We, the President’s 
lawyers, are going to make this end-
less. We promise you, we are going to 
want ADAM SCHIFF to testify. We want 
Joe Biden to testify. Hunter Biden. We 
are going to want the whistleblower. 
We are going to want everyone in the 
world. If you dare, if you have the un-
mitigated temerity to want witnesses 
in a trial, we will make you pay for it 
with endless delay. The Senate will 
never be able to go back to its busi-
ness. 
That is their argument. 
How dare the House assume there 
will be witnesses in a trial. Shouldn’t 
the House have known when they un-
dertook its investigation that the Sen-
ate was never going to allow witnesses; 
that this would be the first impeach-
ment trial in the history of the Repub-
lic with no witnesses? 
So Mr. Sekulow wants me to testify. 
I would like Mr. Sekulow to testify 
about his contact with Mr. Parnas or 
Mr. Cipollone about the efforts to im-
plement the President’s fight on all 
subpoenas. I would like to ask ques-
tions about—well, I would like to ask 
questions of the President and put him 
under oath. But we are not here to in-
dulge in fantasy or distraction; we are 
here to talk about people with perti-
nent and probative evidence. 
And you know something? I trust the 
man behind me, sitting way up, whom 
I can’t see right now, but I trust him to

make decisions about whether a wit-
nesses is material or not, whether it is 
appropriate to out a whistleblower or 
not, whether to—whether a particular 
passage in a document is privileged or 
not. It is not going to take months of 
litigation, although that is what the 
President’s counsel is threatening. 
They are doing the same thing to the 
Senate they did to the House, which is, 
you try to investigate the President, 
you try to try the President, we will 
tie you and your entire Chamber up in 
knots for weeks and months. And you 
know something? They will if you let 
them. 
You don’t have to let them. You can 
subpoena John Bolton. You can allow 
the Chief Justice to make a determina-
tion in camera whether something is 
relevant, whether it deals with Ukraine 
or Venezuela, whether it is privileged 
or it isn’t, whether the privilege is 
being misapplied to hide criminality or 
wrongdoing. We don’t have to go up 
and down the courts; we have a per-
fectly good Chief Justice sitting right 
behind me who can make these deci-
sions in real time. 
So don’t be thrown off by this claim: 
Oh, if you even think about it, we are 
going to make you pay with delays like 
you have never seen. We are going to 
call witnesses that will turn this into a 
circus. 
It shouldn’t be a circus. It should be 
a fair trial. You can’t have a fair trial 
without witnesses. 
I think when I was asked that ques-
tion before, I answered in the affirma-
tive—in the negative. You can’t have a 
fair trial without witnesses, and you 
shouldn’t presume that when a House 
impeaches, the Senate trials from now 
on will be witness-free, will be evi-
dence-free. 
That 
is 
not 
what 
the 
Founders intended. If it was, they 
would have made you the court of ap-
peals. But they didn’t. They made you 
the triers of fact. They expected you to 
hear from witnesses. They expected 
you to evaluate their credibility. 
Don’t take my word for it about John 
Bolton. Look, I am no fan of John 
Bolton’s—although I like him a little 
more than I used to—but you should 
hear from him. You should want to. 
Don’t take General Kelly’s view for it. 
Make up your own mind whether you 
are to believe him or Mick Mulvaney. 
Will you believe John Bolton or the 
President? Make up your own mind. 
Yes, we proved our case, counsel. We 
proved it overwhelmingly. But you 
chose to contest the fact that the 
President withheld military aid to co-
erce an ally. You chose to contest it. 
You chose to make John Bolton’s testi-
mony relevant, pertinent. If you had 
stipulated the President did as he is 
charged, then you might make the ar-
gument that you are making here, but 
you haven’t. You contested it. And now 
you want to say: But the Senate shall 
not hear from this witness. That is not 
a fair trial. It is not even the appear-
ance of fairness. You can’t have a fair 
trial without basic fairness. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself and Senator RISCH, both to the 
White House counsel and the House 
managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Question from Senator CASSIDY and 
Senator RISCH to both parties, begin-
ning with the President’s counsel first: 
We saw a video of Mr. NADLER saying: 
‘‘There must never be a narrowly voted im-
peachment or an impeachment supported by 
one of our major political parties and op-
posed by the other. Such an impeachment 
will lack legitimacy, will produce divisive-
ness and bitterness in our politics for years 
to come, and will call into question the very 
legitimacy of our political institutions.’’ 
Given the well-known dislike of some House 
Democrats for President Trump and the stat-
ed desire of some to impeach before the 
President was inaugurated, and the strictly 
partisan vote in favor of impeachment, do 
the current proceedings typify that which 
Mr. NADLER warned against 20 years ago? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. The simple answer is yes. These 
are exactly the sort of proceedings that 
Manager NADLER
warned against 20 
years ago. It was a purely partisan im-
peachment. And it has been clear that 
at least some factions on the other side 
of the aisle—the Democratic side of the 
aisle—have been intent on finding some 
way to impeach the President from the 
day he was sworn in and even before 
the day he was sworn in, and that is 
dangerous for our country. 
To allow partisan venom and enmity 
like that to take hold and become the 
norm for driving impeachments is ex-
actly 
what 
the 
Framers 
warned 
against. It is in Federalist No. 65. Ham-
ilton warned against it. He warned 
against persecution by an intemperate 
and designing majority in the House of 
Representatives, and that is exactly 
what the Framers did not want im-
peachment to turn into. Yet that is 
clearly what it is turning into here. 
Both Manager NADLER
and Demo-
cratic Leader SCHUMER, in the video 
that we saw, were prescient in fore-
warning that, if we start to go down 
this road, one thing that seems to be 
sure in Washington is that what goes 
around comes around. If it is done once 
to one party, it will happen again to 
the other party and then to the other 
party once the Office of the President 
changes hands. Then we will be in a 
cycle. It will get worse and worse, and 
it will be more and more, and every 
President will be impeached. That is 
not what the Framers intended, and 
this body shouldn’t allow it to happen 
here. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The evi-
dence is overwhelming that President 
Trump pressured a foreign government 
to target an American citizen for per-
sonal and political gain as part of 
President Trump’s corrupt effort to 
cheat and solicit foreign interference 
in the 2020 election. 
There is a remedy for that type of 
stunning abuse of power, and that rem-
edy is in the Constitution. That rem-
edy is impeachment and the consider-
ation of removal, which is what this 
distinguished body is doing right now. 
That is not partisan. That is not the 
Democratic Party’s playbook. That is 
not the Republican Party’s playbook. 
That is the playbook in a democratic 
republic given to us in a precious fash-
ion by the Framers of the Constitution. 
The impeachment in this instance, of 
course, and the consideration of re-
moval is necessary because President 
Trump’s conduct strikes at the very 
heart of our free and fair elections. As 
North 
Carolinian 
delegate 
William 
Davie noted at the Constitutional Con-
vention, ‘‘If he be not impeachable 
whilst in office, he will spare no efforts 
or means whatsoever to get himself re-
elected.’’ 
The Framers of the Constitution un-
derstood that perhaps this remedy 
would one day be necessary. That is 
why we are here right now. 
The American people should decide 
an American election, not the Ukrain-
ians, not the Russians, not the Chi-
nese—the American people. That is 
why this President was impeached. 
That is why it is appropriate for the 
Democrats and the Republicans—both 
sides of the aisle—not as partisans but 
as Americans, to hold this President 
accountable for his stunning abuse of 
power. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for the 
House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator SANDERS
asks the House 
managers: 
Republican lawyers have stated—on sev-
eral occasions—that two people, Senator 
JOHNSON
and Ambassador Sondland, were 
told directly by President Trump that there 
was no quid pro quo in terms of holding back 
Ukraine aid in exchange for an investigation 
into the Bidens. Given the media has docu-
mented President Trump’s thousands of lies 
while in office—more than 16,200 as of Janu-
ary 20—why should we be expected to believe 
that anything President Trump says has 
credibility? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Well, I am not 
quite sure where to begin with that 
question except to say that if every de-
fendant in a trial could be exonerated 
just by denying the crime, there would 
be no trial. It doesn’t work that way. 
I think it is telling that when Am-
bassador Sondland spoke with Presi-
dent Trump, the first words out of his 
mouth, according to Sondland, were 
‘‘no quid pro quo.’’ That is the kind of 
thing you blurt out when you have 
been caught in the act and say: It was 
not me. I didn’t do it. 
Even then, the President couldn’t 
help himself because the other half of 
that conversation was ‘‘no quid pro

quo’’ but that Zelensky needs to go to 
the mic, and what is more, he should 
want to—no quid pro quo but quid pro 
quo. 
This reminds me of something that 
came up earlier. Why would the Presi-
dent—when he is on the call of July 25 
and knows that there are other people 
listening, why on Earth would the 
President engage in this kind of shake-
down with others being within earshot? 
You know, I think this question comes 
up in almost every criminal trial. Why 
would the defendant do that? 
Sometimes it is very hard to fathom, 
and sometimes it is just that people 
make mistakes. In this case, I think 
the President truly believes that he is 
above the law. He truly believes that 
he is above the law. It doesn’t matter 
who is listening. It doesn’t matter who 
is listening. If it is good for him—I 
guess this is a version of Dershowitz’ 
argument—if it is good for him, it is 
good for the state because he is the 
state. If it helps his reelection, it is 
good for America, and whatever means 
he needs to effectuate his election, 
whether it is withholding military aid 
or what have you, as long as it helps 
him get elected, well, it is good for 
America because he is the state. This is 
why I think he is so irate when people 
come forward and blow the whistle, not 
just the whistleblower but people like 
John Bolton or General Kelly. 
You might ask the question: Why do 
so many people who leave this adminis-
tration walk away from this President 
with such conviction that he is under-
mining our security that you cannot 
believe what he says? Think about this: 
The President’s now former Chief of 
Staff, General Kelly, doesn’t believe 
the President of the United States; he 
believes John Bolton. 
I mean, can everybody be disgrun-
tled? Can it all be a matter of bias? I 
think we know the answer. I think we 
know the answer. I mean, how do you 
believe a President to whom the Wash-
ington Post has documented so many 
false statements? The short answer is, 
you can’t. 
I remember, early in his Presidency, 
many of us talked about how once as 
President, you lose your credibility, 
and once as President, your country or 
your friends or allies around the world 
cannot rely on your word and just how 
disruptive and dangerous it is to the 
country. So we can’t accept the denial. 
It is a false denial. 
Indeed, if you look at the Wall Street 
Journal article that Senator JOHNSON 
was interviewed in, when he had that 
conversation with Sondland and had 
that sinking feeling because he didn’t 
want those two things tied together, 
everyone understood they were tied to-
gether. It was as simple as two plus 
two equals four. 
So can you rely on a false excul-
patory? You can’t with this President 
any more than you can with any other 
accused and probably, given the Presi-
dent’s track record, a lot less than 
other accused. But at the end of the 
day, we have people with firsthand 
knowledge who don’t have to rely on 
his false exculpatory. You don’t have 
to rely on Mick Mulvaney’s recanting 
what you all saw so graphically on TV. 
How does somebody say, without a 
doubt, this was a factor, that this is 
why he did it? 
By the way, Alan Dershowitz lost a 
criminal case in which he argued that 
if a corrupt motive is only part of the 
motive, you can’t convict. And the 
court said: Oh, yes, you can. If a cor-
rupt motive is any part of it, you can 
convict. So he has lost that argument 
before, and he makes this argument 
again before this court. It shouldn’t be 
any more availing here than it was 
there. 
At the end of the day, though, there 
is no more interested party here than 
the President of the United States, and 
I think we have seen he will say what-
ever he believes suits his interest. Let’s 
instead rely on the evidence and rely 
on others, and one is just a subpoena 
away. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Colorado. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator GARDNER is 
for counsel to the President: 
Arguments have been made that any asser-
tion of protection from disclosure is indic-
ative of guilt and that the House’s assertion 
of Impeachment power cannot be questioned 
by the Executive. Is that interpretation of 
the House’s Impeachment power consistent 
with the Constitution, and what protects the 
Executive from the House abusing the Im-
peachment power in the future? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice and Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
The House managers’ assertion that 
any effort to assert a privilege or as-
sert a legal immunity to decline dis-
closing information is somehow a sign 
of guilt is not the law. It is, actually, 
fundamentally contrary to the law. 
Legal privileges exist for a reason. 
We allow people to assert their rights. 
It is a basic part of the American jus-
tice system. Asserting your rights—as-
serting privileges and immunities to 
process rights even if it means limiting 
the information that might be turned 
over to a tribunal—is not and cannot 
be treated as evidence of guilt. 
To the second part of the question, as 
to the House managers’ theory that the 
power of impeachment means that the 
President can’t resist any subpoena 
that they issue pursuant to the power 
of impeachment, it is not consistent 
with the Constitution. The Constitu-
tion gives the House the sole power of 
impeachment, which means only that 
the House is the only place—the only 
part of the government—that has that 
power. It doesn’t say that they have a 
paramount power of impeachment that 
destroys all other constitutional rights 
or privileges or immunities. It doesn’t 
mean that executive privilege suddenly 
disappears. 
The House managers a number of 
times have cited Nixon v. United 
States or—I might get it reversed 
now—United States v. Nixon. It was 
the case involving the President in 
1974. The Supreme Court determined 
that, in that particular case, after a 
balancing of interests, assertions of ex-
ecutive privilege would have to give 
way, but it did not say that there was 
just an absolute, blanket rule that any-
time there is an allegation of wrong-
doing or that there is an impeachment 
going on in the background, that exec-
utive privilege just disappears. That is 
not the rule from that case. In fact, 
even in that context, the Court pointed 
out that there may be an absolute im-
munity or privilege in the field of for-
eign relations and national security, 
which is the field we are dealing with 
here. 
The Framers recognized that there 
could be partisan and illegitimate im-
peachments. They recognized that the 
House could impeach for the wrong rea-
sons, but they didn’t leave the execu-
tive branch totally defenseless to that. 
Executive privilege and immunities 
rooted in executive privilege, such as 
the absolute immunity for senior ad-
visers, still applies even in the context 
of an impeachment. That is part of the 
checks and balances in the Constitu-
tion. They don’t fall away simply be-
cause the House says: Ah, now we want 
to proceed on impeachment. 
It is necessary for the proper func-
tioning of the government and the sep-
aration of powers for the executive 
branch to retain that ability to protect 
confidentiality interests, to protect the 
prerogatives of the Office of the Presi-
dency. For any President to fail to as-
sert those rights and to protect them 
would do lasting damage to the Office 
of the Presidency for the future. 
I think that is a critical point to un-
derstand in that there is a danger in 
the legal theory that the House man-
agers are proposing here because it 
would do lasting damage to the separa-
tion of powers—to the structure of our 
government—to have the idea be that, 
as soon as the House flips the switch 
that they want to start proceeding on 
impeachment, the executive has no de-
fenses and has to open every file and 
display everything. That is not the way 
the Framers had it in mind, because 
the executive branch has to have still 
its defenses for its sphere of authority 
under the Constitution. That is part of 
the checks and balances. 
And before I sit down, I would just 
like to close by going back to the Sen-
ator who asked the question about the 
review process in the Bolton book. I be-
lieve I was clear about this, but I just 
want to make 100 percent sure to the 
extent the Senator was asking for an 
assurance that only career officials in 
the NSC review it for classification re-
view. 
I can’t make that assurance because 
it is an NSC process, and I am not sure. 
At the levels of the process, there 
might be other reviews. So I didn’t in-
tend to give and I don’t want it to be

understood as giving that assurance to 
you. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for House 
managers and counsel to the President. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The House managers will respond first 
to this question from Senator WARREN. 
If Ukrainian President Zelensky called 
President Trump and offered dirt on Presi-
dent Trump’s political rivals in exchange for 
President Trump handing over hundreds of 
millions in military aid, that would clearly 
be bribery and an impeachable offense. So 
why would it be more acceptable—and some-
how not impeachable—for the reverse, that 
is, for President Trump to propose the same 
corrupt bargain? 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Bribery is ob-
viously an impeachable offense. Brib-
ery is contained within the accusation 
at the House level of abuse of power. 
We explained in the Judiciary Com-
mittee report that the practice of im-
peachment in the United States has 
tended to envelope charges of bribery 
within the broader standard of other 
high crimes and misdemeanors. That is 
the historical standard. 
The elements of bribery are clearly 
established here. The abuse of power is 
clearly established. When the Presi-
dent of the United States offers some-
thing—extorts a foreign power to get a 
benefit for himself, withholds military 
aid in order to get that foreign power 
to do something that would help him 
politically—that is clearly bribery, it 
is clearly an abuse of power, and there 
is no question about it. 
Now, by the way, the question was 
raised earlier as to what the proper 
standard of proof is. People pointed out 
the Constitution doesn’t say. But the 
highest standard of proof is beyond a 
reasonable doubt, and these facts have 
been proven not beyond a reasonable 
doubt, beyond any doubt. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
I think what this hypothetical shows, 
what Manager NADLER shows, is this is 
an effort to try to smuggle into Arti-
cles of Impeachment that do not men-
tion any crime the idea that there is 
some crime alleged here. There is not, 
and I went through that earlier. 
The Articles of Impeachment specify 
a theory of the charge here that is 
abuse of power. They do not allege the 
elements of bribery or extortion. They 
don’t mention bribery or extortion. 
If the House managers had wanted to 
bring those charges, they had to put 
them in the Articles of Impeachment, 
just the way a prosecutor, if he wants 
to put someone on trial for bribery, he 
has got to put it in the indictment. 
If you don’t, and you come to trial 
and then try to start arguing that, 
‘‘well, actually, we think there is brib-
ery going on here,’’ that is impermis-
sible. It is prosecutorial misconduct. 
And so a hypothetical that is con-
trary to what the facts were here, to 
try to suggest that maybe there is 
some element of bribery, that is all be-
side the point. We have specific facts. 
We have evidence that has been pre-
sented in the record. We have a specific 
Article of Impeachment. It doesn’t say 
bribery. It doesn’t say extortion. And 
there is no way to get that into this 
case at this point because the House 
managers had the opportunity to frame 
their case. They had every opportunity 
to frame it any way they wanted be-
cause they controlled the whole proc-
ess. They controlled all the evidence 
that went in. They controlled all the 
evidence with the witnesses that were 
called, and they could frame it any way 
they wanted, and they didn’t put in 
any crime. There is no crime asserted 
here. It is not part of the Articles of 
Impeachment, and it can’t be consid-
ered now. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Thank you, Mr. Chief 
Justice. I submit to the desk a ques-
tion on my behalf and on behalf of Sen-
ator CORNYN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator MORAN and Senator COR-
NYN is for counsel to the President: 
Is it true that in these proceedings that 
the Chief Justice can rule on the issue of 
productions of exhibits and the testimony of 
witnesses over the objection of either the 
managers or the President’s counsel? Would 
a determination by the Chief Justice be sub-
ject to judicial review? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion, and let me answer it this way— 
lay out my understanding of the proc-
ess. 
If we were going to start talking 
about 
subpoenaing 
witnesses, 
sub-
poenaing documents, having things 
come into evidence that way, the first 
question would be subpoenas would 
have to be issued to the witnesses or 
for the documents, and if those sub-
poenas were resisted on the grounds of 
some privilege or immunity, then that 
would have to be sorted out because if 
the President asserted, for example, 
the immunity of a senior adviser to the 
President or an executive privilege 
over certain documents, then the Sen-
ate would have to determine whether it 
was going to fight that assertion and 
how—through 
some 
accommodation 
process and negotiation—or if the Sen-
ate were going to go to court to liti-
gate that. And that whole process 
would have to play out. That would be 
the first stage, and that would have to 
be gone through anytime the President 
resisted the subpoena on the witnesses 
or documents. That would take a 
while. 
That is what the House managers de-
cided not to do in the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Then, once there had been everything 
resolved on a subpoena, or something 
like that, it sounds like the question 
asks further, in terms of questions here 
in the trial, of admissibility of par-
ticular evidence. It is my under-
standing, then, that the Presiding Offi-
cer—the Chief Justice—could make an 
initial determination if there were ob-
jections to admission of evidence, but 
that all such determinations can be 
challenged by the Members of the Sen-
ate and would be subject to a vote. 
So it would not be—I think there 
were some suggestions earlier—that we 
don’t need any other courts; we don’t 
need anything involved with anyone 
else because the Chief Justice is here. 
That is not correct. On the subpoenas 
at the front end, that is not going to be 
something that is determined just— 
with all respect, sir—just by the Chief 
Justice. That is something that would 
have to be sorted out at the courts or 
by negotiation with the executive 
branch. 
Then, once we are here on specific 
evidentiary objections, if we have a 
witness and there are objections during 
depositions that have to be resolved, or 
by a witness on the stand, if there are 
objections to particular documents— 
authentication or things like that—the 
Chief Justice could make an initial rul-
ing, but every one of those rulings 
could be appealed to this body to vote 
by a majority vote on whether the evi-
dence would come in or not. 
And you might have to consider 
rules, whether you are going to have 
the Federal Rules of Evidence apply or 
some modified rules of evidence, and 
all of that would have to be sorted out. 
I don’t think that we would get to 
the stage, then, of any determinations 
in evidence here being in any way ap-
pealed out to the courts, but that 
would be a process that this body 
would have to decide what would be ad-
missible in evidence in the trial. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. SMITH. Thank you. Mr. Chief 
Justice, I send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator SMITH is 
to the House managers: 
The President has stated multiple times in 
public that his actions were perfect—yet he 
refuses to allow Bolton, Mulvaney, and oth-
ers to testify under oath. If the President’s 
actions are so perfect, why wouldn’t he allow 
fact witnesses to testify under oath about 
what he has said publicly? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Well, the short 
answer is, if the President were so con-
fident that this was a perfect call and 
that those around him would agree 
that there was nothing nefarious going 
on, he would want witnesses to come 
and testify. But, of course, he doesn’t. 
He doesn’t want his former National 
Security Advisor to testify. He doesn’t 
want his current Chief of Staff to tes-
tify. He doesn’t want those that were 
heading OMB to testify. He doesn’t 
want you to hear from any of them. 
Now, I think that is pretty indicative 
that he knows what they have to say

and he doesn’t want you to hear what 
they have to say. He doesn’t want you 
to see any of the myriad of documents 
that he has been withholding from this 
body as he did from the House. 
But I also want to address the last 
question, if I could. Is the Chief Justice 
empowered under the Senate rules to 
adjudicate questions of witnesses and 
privilege? And the answer is yes. 
Can the Chief Justice make those de-
terminations quickly? The answer is 
yes. 
Is the Senate empowered to overturn 
the Chief Justice? Under certain cir-
cumstances. 
Is the vote 50 or is the vote two- 
thirds? That would be something that 
we would have to discuss with the Par-
liamentarian and with the Chief Jus-
tice. 
But the Chief Justice has the power 
to do it, and, what is more, under the 
Senate rules, you want expedited proc-
ess? We are here to tell you: We will 
agree with the Chief Justice’s ruling on 
witnesses, on their materiality, on the 
application or nonapplication of privi-
lege. We agree to be bound by the Chief 
Justice. We will not seek to litigate an 
adverse ruling, and we will not seek to 
appeal an adverse ruling. 
Will the President’s counsel do the 
same? And, if not, just as the President 
doesn’t trust what these witnesses have 
to say, the President’s lawyers don’t 
want to rely on what the Chief Jus-
tice’s rulings might be. 
Now, why is that? They, as we, un-
derstand the Chief Justice will be fair. 
I am not for a moment suggesting they 
don’t think the Chief Justice is fair— 
quite the contrary. They are afraid he 
will be fair. They are afraid he will 
make a fair ruling. That should tell 
you something about the weakness of 
their position. 
They don’t want a fair trial with wit-
nesses. They don’t want a fair Justice 
to adjudicate these questions. They 
just want to suggest to you that they 
will delay and delay and delay. 
I think it was Thomas Paine who 
said: Those who would enjoy the bless-
ings of liberty must undergo the rigors 
of defending it—the fatigues of defend-
ing it. 
Is it too much fatigue for us to hear 
from a witness? Is that how little effort 
we are willing to put into the blessings 
of freedom and liberty? Is that how lit-
tle fatigue we are willing to incur? 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. I send a question to the 
desk on behalf of myself, TIM SCOTT, 
and MARCO RUBIO. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator SASSE and 
also on behalf of Senator SCOTT from 
South Carolina and Mr. RUBIO, directed 
to counsel for the President: 
Mr. Cipollone pointed Senators to the 
‘‘golden rule of impeachment.’’ In elabo-
rating on that rule, can you offer your views 
on the limiting principles—both in the na-
ture of offenses that should be considered 
and in the proximity to elections—for future 
impeachments, toward the end of safe-
guarding public trust by putting guardrails 
on both parties? 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the 
Senate. 
In elaborating on the golden rule of 
impeachment, I would say principle No. 
1, if we listen to what the Democratic 
Senators said in the past and the House 
managers and other Members of the 
House, that should guide us, and that 
principle is—and it is a principle based 
on precedent that you shouldn’t have a 
partisan impeachment. 
If you have a partisan impeachment, 
that, in and of itself, is a dangerous 
thing because that means that there is 
not the bipartisan support that even 
the Speaker of the House has said you 
would need to even begin to consider 
the impeachment of a President be-
cause it is the overturning of an elec-
tion. They don’t dispute that it is the 
overturning of an election. 
In addition, it is the removal of this 
President from an election that is oc-
curring just months from now, which I 
think is another important principle. 
I think the other important fact here 
is that there is actually bipartisan op-
position to this impeachment. Demo-
crats voted against it in the House of 
Representatives. That is an important 
principle. 
The other principle would be that if 
you have a process that is unprece-
dented—if you have a process that is 
unprecedented—that should be some-
thing that ought to be considered. Al-
ways in the past there has been a vote 
authorizing an impeachment. Why? Be-
cause they say the House is the sole 
authority of impeachment—but that is 
the House, not the Speaker of the 
House at a press conference. That is 
another important consideration. 
Another important consideration is 
all of the historical precedents related 
to rights given to a President in a proc-
ess have been violated. We haven’t seen 
anything like that in our history. The 
President’s counsel wasn’t able to at-
tend, wasn’t allowed to cross-examine 
witnesses, wasn’t allowed to call wit-
nesses; and they are coming here and 
basically asking you, No. 1, to call wit-
nesses that they had refused to pursue, 
but, more importantly, I think what 
they are saying is, do what they did— 
only call witnesses that they want. 
Don’t allow the President to call wit-
nesses that the President wants. That 
doesn’t work. That is not due process. 
The other important principle there 
is, we hear a lot about fairness, but in 
the American justice system fairness is 
about fairness to the accused. Fairness 
is about fairness to the accused. So 
how can you suggest that what we are 
going to do is, we are going to have a 
trial. We will get the witnesses and 
prosecutors that we want, even though 
you got to call no witnesses in the 
House. You got to cross-examine none 
of the witnesses that we called, and 
have we got a deal for you: Let’s call 
another witness, but you call none. 
That is another principle. 
And I think the reality is that what 
Professor Dershowitz said is true. I 
think, when you are thinking about 
impeachment, as much as we can as 
human beings, we should think about 
it in terms of a President is a President 
regardless of party, and how would we 
treat a President of our own party in 
similar circumstances? I think that is 
the golden rule of impeachment. 
I don’t think we have to guess here 
because I think we have lots of state-
ments from Democrats when we were 
here last time around and principles. 
As I said, I agree with them, I agree 
with those principles. I just ask that 
they be applied here. 
That is my answer. Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator DURBIN asks the House man-
agers: 
If President Trump were to actually in-
voke executive privilege in this proceeding, 
wouldn’t he be required to identify the spe-
cific documents or communications con-
taining sensitive material that he seeks to 
protect? 
Mr. Manager NADLER. As stated be-
fore, executive privilege is a very lim-
ited privilege that must be claimed by 
the President. He has at no time 
claimed executive privilege. Rather, he 
has claimed absolute immunity, a non-
existent concept that every court that 
has ever considered it has rejected. In-
stead, he has simply said: We will op-
pose all subpoenas. We will deny to the 
House all information—all informa-
tion. Whatever they want, they can’t 
have. This is way beyond the pale, and 
it is intended to be because he fears the 
facts. 
The facts are, he tried to extort a for-
eign government through withholding 
military aid that this Congress had 
voted—he broke the law to withhold 
the aid that this Congress had man-
dated be sent to them in order to pres-
sure them into announcing an inves-
tigation of his political opponent. 
Those are the facts. Those facts are 
proven beyond any doubt at all. 
So what do we have? We have a diver-
sion after diversion, diversions about 
what Hunter Biden may have done in 
Ukraine—irrelevant, whatever he did 
in Ukraine. The question is, Did the 
President withhold foreign military aid 
in order to extort a foreign government 
into helping him rig an American elec-
tion? 
We hear diversions about privilege. 
We hear questions about witnesses. We 
know he is telling the Senators don’t 
allow witnesses. Why? Because he 
knows what the witnesses will say. 
We hear arguments from his counsel: 
Well, we have taken enough time with 
witnesses. The House shouldn’t have 
voted if it didn’t have proof positive. 
We had proof positive. We voted it. It

doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have more 
proof if it comes forward. 
There is no argument that Mr. 
Bolton shouldn’t be permitted to tes-
tify. He is not going to waste our time. 
He has told us he will testify with a 
subpoena. 
So all of these questions are diver-
sions. They are diversions by a Presi-
dent who is desperate because we have 
proven the facts that he threatened a 
foreign government—not just threat-
ened them, did, in fact, withhold man-
dated American military aid from 
them in order to blackmail them into 
serving his political purposes, for pri-
vate political purposes. We know that. 
Everything else is a diversion. 
No witnesses—because maybe those 
witnesses will testify in a way he 
doesn’t want. 
Privilege—when you are dealing with 
accusations of wrongdoing against the 
President, the Supreme Court told us 
in the Nixon case, privilege yields. 
So all of these arguments are diver-
sions. Keep your eye on the facts. The 
facts we have proven. And let’s see if 
the additional witnesses—and as Mr. 
SCHIFF said, witnesses should not be a 
threat, not to the Senate, not to any-
body else. And it is not going to waste 
too much time because the Chief Jus-
tice can rule on relevant questions— 
questions of relevancy or privilege or 
anything else. 
But the facts are the facts. The 
President is a danger to the United 
States. He has tried to rig the next 
election. He has abused his power and 
he must be brought to heel and the 
country must be saved from his con-
tinuing efforts to rig our elections. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
submit a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator ROMNEY 
is for the counsel for the President: 
On what specific date did President Trump 
first order the hold on security assistance to 
Ukraine and did he explain the reason at 
that time? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
I don’t think that there is evidence 
in the record of a specific date—the 
specific date—but there is testimony in 
the record that individuals at OMB and 
elsewhere were aware of the hold as of 
July 3, and there is evidence in the 
record of the President’s rationale 
from even earlier than that time. 
There is an email from June 24 that 
has been publicly released. It was pub-
licly released in response to a FOIA re-
quest that is from one DOD staffer up 
to the Chief of Staff of DOD—excuse 
me, sorry—from the Chief of Staff 
down to a staffer from DOD relating on 
the subject line: POTUS follow-up. Fol-
low-up from a meeting with POTUS, 
President of the United States, ex-
plaining questions that had been asked 
about Ukraine assistance, which were 
specifically: What was the funding used 
for, i.e., did it go to U.S. firms; who 
funded it; and what do other NATO 
members spend to support Ukraine? 
So from the very beginning, in June, 
the President had expressed his con-
cern about burden-sharing, what do 
other NATO members do. Similarly, in 
the July 25 transcript, there was—the 
President asked President Zelensky 
specifically. He raised the issue of bur-
den-sharing. Again, showing that was 
his concern. In addition, there was, I 
believe, Mr. Morrison, who testified 
that he was aware from OMB that the 
President had expressed concerns about 
corruption and that there was a review 
process 
to 
consider 
corruption 
in 
Ukraine. 
So the evidence in the record shows 
that the President raised concerns at 
least as of June 24; that people were 
aware of the hold as of July 3; the 
President’s 
concerns 
about 
burden- 
sharing were in the email on June 24; 
they were reflected in the July 25 call. 
Similarly, there is testimony from 
later in the summer that the President 
had raised concerns about corruption 
in Ukraine. So that is the evidence in 
the record that reflects the President’s 
concerns. Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. The Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator CORTEZ MASTO is to the 
House managers: 
The President’s counsel has claimed that 
the President was unfairly excluded from 
House impeachment processes. Can you de-
scribe the due process President Trump re-
ceived during House proceedings compared 
to previous presidents? Did President Trump 
take advantage of any opportunities to have 
his counsel participate? 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief 
Justice, and to Senators, thank you so 
much for that question. 
Let me make this plain. The Presi-
dent is not the victim here. The victim 
in this case is the American people. 
President Trump was invited to attend 
and participate in all of the Judiciary 
Committee hearings. He could have had 
Mr. Cipollone, Mr. Sekulow, or any of 
the other attorneys who have joined at 
the counsel table participate through-
out the Judiciary Committee pro-
ceedings in the House. They could have 
attended all of the Judiciary hearings, 
and imagine this—cross-examine wit-
nesses, raise objections, present evi-
dence favorable to the President, if 
they had any to present, and they 
could have requested to have President 
Trump’s own witnesses called. 
But President Trump refused to par-
ticipate. He wrote to the House, and I 
quote: ‘‘If you are going to impeach 
me, do it now, fast, so we can have a 
fair trial in the Senate. . . .’’ 
In every event, President Trump was 
asked, and indeed legally required, to 
provide evidence during the Intel-
ligence Committee investigation, but 
he refused, as we have already said 
over and over again, to produce any 
documents or allow witnesses to tes-
tify. We thank God for the 17 public 
servants who came forward in spite of 
the President’s efforts to obstruct. 
In addition, Republican Members in 
Congress had an equal opportunity to 
ask questions during the depositions 
and the hearings in both the Intel-
ligence and the Judiciary Committee 
hearings. Republican Members called 
three witnesses during the Intelligence 
Committee’s hearings and an addi-
tional witness during the Judiciary 
Committee hearing. 
Of course, a House impeachment in-
quiry is not a full-blown criminal trial. 
We do know that. But this is a trial, 
and, obviously, the President is being 
afforded every due process right during 
these proceedings. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I send a question 
to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator MURKOWSKI’s question is for 
the House managers: 
In early October, Mr. Cipollone sent the 
letter saying none of the subpoenas issued by 
the House were appropriately authorized and 
thus invalid. When the House passed their 
resolution authorizing the impeachment in-
quiry, and granting subpoena power to the 
Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, the 
body could have addressed the deficiency the 
White House pointed out and proclaimed 
those subpoenas as valid exercises of the im-
peachment inquiry. Alternatively, the House 
could have reissued the subpoenas after the 
resolution was adopted. Please explain why 
neither of those actions took place. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. 
Chief Justice, Senator, I appreciate 
your question. 
These arguments, plain and simple, 
are a red herring. The House’s im-
peachment inquiry and its subpoenas 
were fully authorized by the Constitu-
tion, House rules, and precedent. It is 
for the House, not the President, to de-
cide how to conduct an impeachment 
inquiry. 
The House’s autonomy to structure 
its own proceedings for impeachment 
inquiry is rooted in two provisions of 
article I of the Constitution. First, ar-
ticle I vests the House with the ‘‘sole 
Power of Impeachment.’’ It contains no 
requirements—no requirements—as to 
how the House must carry out that re-
sponsibility. 
Second, article I states that the 
House is empowered to determine the 
rules of proceedings. Taken together, 
these provisions give the House sole 
discretion to determine the manner in 
which they investigate, deliberate, and 
vote for grounds of impeachment. 
In exercising its responsibility to in-
vestigate and consider the impeach-
ment of a President of the United 
States, the House is constitutionally 
entitled to relevant information from 
the executive branch concerning the 
President’s misconduct. The Framers, 
the courts, and past Presidents have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

January 29, 2020 
recognized 
and 
honored 
Congress’s 
right to information in an impeach-
ment investigation and is critical as a 
safeguard to our system of divided pow-
ers; otherwise, a President could hide 
his own wrongdoing to prevent Con-
gress from discovering impeachable 
misconduct, 
effectively 
nullifying— 
nullifying—Congress’s 
impeachment 
power. 
That is precisely what President 
Trump has tried to achieve here. The 
President has asserted the power to de-
termine for himself which congres-
sional subpoenas he will respond to and 
those that he will not. The President’s 
counsel would have you believe that 
each time anyone in the executive 
branch gets a subpoena, it is open sea-
son for creative lawyers in the White 
House and DOJ to start inventing theo-
ries about House rules and parliamen-
tary precedent. 
This is not how the separation of 
powers works, and to accept that argu-
ment would wholly undermine the 
House’s and Senate’s ability to provide 
oversight of the executive branch. It 
would also make impeachment a nul-
lity. 
The President argues that there was 
no resolution fully authorizing the im-
peachment inquiry, but, again, there is 
no requirement for the full House to 
take a vote before conducting an im-
peachment inquiry. President Trump 
and his lawyers invented this theory. 
As Chief Judge Howell of the U.S. 
District Court in DC has stated, and 
this is a direct quote: ‘‘This [claim] has 
no textual support in the U.S. Con-
stitution [or] the governing rules of the 
House.’’ 
The Constitution itself says nothing 
about how the House may exercise its 
sole power of impeachment, but instead 
confirms the House shall have the sole 
power to determine the rules of its own 
proceedings. This conclusion is also 
confirmed 
by 
precedent. 
Numerous 
judges have been subjected to impeach-
ment investigations in the House and 
even impeached by the House and con-
victed by the Senate without any pre-
vious vote of the House authorizing an 
impeachment inquiry. 
As recently as the 114th Congress, the 
Judiciary Committee considered im-
peaching the IRS Commissioner fol-
lowing a referral from another com-
mittee and absent a full House vote. 
The Judiciary Committee began an in-
vestigation into President Nixon’s mis-
conduct for 4 months before approval of 
a full House resolution. 
The House rules also do not preclude 
committees from inquiring into the po-
tential grounds for impeachment. In-
stead, those rules vest the relevant 
committees of the House with robust 
investigatory powers, including the 
power to issue subpoenas. 
Each of the three committees that 
conducted the initial investigation of 
President 
Trump’s 
conduct 
in 
Ukraine—Intelligence, Oversight, and 
Foreign Affairs—indisputably had over-
sight jurisdiction over these matters. 
The President’s counsel has pointed to 
the Nixon impeachment with a full 
House. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you 
very much. Thank you. 
Ms. 
Manager 
GARCIA 
of 
Texas. 
Thank you. I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I send a question to the desk, and 
because my question references an ear-
lier question, I have attached that ear-
lier question as a reference to provide 
it to the Office of the Parliamentarian 
in case it should be of interest. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator WHITE-
HOUSE is to counsel for the President: 
White House counsel refused to answer a 
direct question from Senator COLLINS and 
Senator MURKOWSKI, saying he could only 
cite to the record. Five minutes afterward 
White House counsel read recent newspaper 
stories to the Senate from outside the House 
record. Could you please give an accurate 
and truthful answer to the Senators’ ques-
tion: Did the President ever mention the 
Bidens 
in 
connection 
to 
corruption 
in 
Ukraine before Vice President Biden an-
nounced his candidacy in April 2019? What 
did the President say, to whom, and when? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
I don’t think that I refused to answer 
the question at all. We had been ad-
vised by the House managers that they 
were going to object if we attempted to 
introduce anything that was not either 
in the public domain—so things that 
are in newspaper articles, things like 
that that are out there we could refer 
to—or things that were in the record. 
And so I can’t—I am not in a position 
to go back into things that the Presi-
dent might have said in private, and 
there has been no discovery into that. 
It is not part of this inquiry, so I can’t 
go telling now about things that the 
President might have said to Cabinet 
Members. I am not in a position to say 
that. I can tell you what is in the pub-
lic, and I can tell you what is in the 
record. I answered the question fully to 
the best of my ability based on what is 
in the public domain and what is in the 
record. 
I would like to take a moment to 
also respond to the last question that 
was posed by Senator MURKOWSKI with 
respect to the vote on authorizing the 
issuance of subpoenas because there 
has always been a vote from the full 
House to authorize any impeachment 
inquiry into a Presidential impeach-
ment. It was that way in the Johnson 
impeachment. It was that way in the 
Nixon impeachment. 
There have been references to the 
fact that the House Judiciary Com-
mittee began some investigatory work 
before the House actually voted on the 
resolution—I think it was Resolution 
803—to authorize the impeachment in-
quiry. But all that work was simply 
gathering things that were in the pub-
lic domain or that had been already 
gathered by other committees, and 
there was no compulsory process issue. 
And in fact, Chairman Rodino of the 
House Judiciary Committee specifi-
cally determined, when there was a 
move to have the House Judiciary 
Committee issue subpoenas after the 
Saturday Night Massacre, that the 
committee lacked the authority to 
issue any compulsory process until 
there had been a vote by the full House 
authorizing the committee to do that. 
This is not some esoteric special rule 
about impeachments. As I have tried to 
explain, this is just a fundamental rule 
under the Constitution about how au-
thority had been given by ‘‘we the peo-
ple’’ to Chambers of the legislature, ei-
ther the House or the Senate. Once it is 
given there to the House, how does it 
get to a committee? It can only get 
down to a committee if it is delegated 
by the House. That can only happen if 
the House votes. There is no standing 
rule that gives the House Judiciary 
Committee authority to use the power 
of impeachment as opposed to the au-
thority to legislate. There is no rule 
that gives you the power to use the au-
thority of impeachment to issue com-
pulsory process. 
Rule 10 doesn’t mention impeach-
ment at all. The word doesn’t appear in 
it. That is why it has always been the 
understanding that there must be a 
vote from the House to authorize the 
House Judiciary Committee or in this 
case—it was contrary to all prior prac-
tice—it was given to Manager SCHIFF’s 
committee and other committees the 
authority to use the power of impeach-
ment to issue subpoenas. 
It was very clear to the House of Rep-
resentatives that the position of the 
executive branch was that all of the 
subpoenas issued before H. Res. 660 
were invalid on their face, and Senator 
MURKOWSKI’s question is exactly cor-
rect: There was no effort in H. Res. 660 
either to attempt to retroactively au-
thorize those subpoenas or to say that 
those subpoenas—to retroactively au-
thorize those subpoenas or then to re-
issue them under H. Res. 660, so the 
subpoenas remained invalid. There was 
no response from the House to that. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. Chief Justice, I

counsel for the President and the 
House managers on my own behalf and 
on behalf of Senator CRUZ, Senator 
DAINES, and Senator BRAUN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The President’s counsel will respond 
first to the question from Senator 
HAWLEY and the other Senators: 
When he took office, Viktor Shokin, 
Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, vowed to in-
vestigate Burisma. Before Vice President 
Joe Biden pressed Ukrainian officials on cor-
ruption, including pushing for the removal of 
Shokin, did the White House Counsel’s Office 
or the Office of the Vice President legal 
counsel issue ethics advice approving Mr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S683 
January 29, 2020 
Biden’s involvement in matters involving 
corruption in Ukraine or Shokin, despite the 
presence of Hunter Biden on the board of 
Burisma, a company widely considered to be 
corrupt? Did Vice President Biden ever ask 
Hunter Biden to step down from the board of 
Burisma? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
We are not aware of any evidence 
that then-Vice President Biden sought 
any ethics opinion. We are aware that 
both Amos Hochstein and Deputy As-
sistant Secretary of State Kent testi-
fied—excuse me—Amos Hochstein is in 
the public domain. Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State Kent testified in the 
proceedings before the House that they 
each raised the issue with Vice Presi-
dent Biden of the potential appearance 
of a conflict of interest with his son 
Hunter being on the board of Burisma. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent testi-
fied that although he raised that issue 
with the Vice President’s office, the re-
sponse was that the Vice President’s 
Office—the Vice President was busy 
dealing then with the illness of his 
other son, and there was no action 
taken. So from what we know, there 
wasn’t any effort to seek an ethics 
opinion. We are not aware of an ethics 
opinion having been issued. Although 
the issue was flagged for the Vice 
President’s Office, we are not aware 
that Vice President Biden asked his 
son to step down or that any other ac-
tion was taken. And I believe that Vice 
President Biden has said that he never 
discussed—he said publicly he never 
discussed his son’s overseas business 
dealings with him. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senator, I appreciate your 
question. The facts about Vice Presi-
dent Biden’s conduct are clear and do 
not change. Let’s go through them. 
First, every witness asked about this 
topic testified that Mr. Shokin was 
widely considered to be a corrupt and 
ineffective prosecutor who did not 
prosecute corruption. Shokin was so 
corrupt that the entire free world—the 
United States, the European Union, the 
International Monetary Fund—pressed 
for his office to be cleaned up. So I 
would caution you to be skeptical of 
anything that Mr. Shokin claims. 
Second, witnesses, including our own 
anti-corruption advocate, Ambassador 
Yovanovitch—remember 
that 
very 
dedicated 
anti-corruption 
Ambas-
sador—testified that Shokin’s removal 
made it more likely that investiga-
tions of corrupt European—Ukrainian 
companies would move forward. Let me 
repeat that. The dismissal of Shokin 
made it more likely that Burisma 
would be investigated. 
Third, Burisma was not under scru-
tiny at the time Joe Biden called for 
Shokin’s ouster, according to the Na-
tional 
Anti-Corruption 
Bureau 
of 
Ukraine, an organization several wit-
nesses testified is effective at fighting 
corruption. 
Shokin’s office investigated Burisma, 
but the probe focused on a period be-
fore Hunter Biden joined the company. 
But, again, another investigation was 
warranted. Dismissing Shokin would 
have made that more likely. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Mr. KING. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Maine. 
Mr. KING. Mr. Chief Justice, I have a 
question for the House managers I will 
send to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator 
KING’s 
question 
for 
the 
House managers reads as follows: 
Mr. Rudolph Giuliani was in Ukraine ex-
clusively on a political errand—by his own 
admission—so doesn’t the President’s men-
tion of Giuliani by name in the July 25th call 
conclusively establish the real purpose of the 
call? 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, Mr. 
Giuliani played a key role in President 
Trump’s monthslong scheme to pres-
sure Ukraine to announce political in-
vestigations to benefit the President’s 
reelection campaign. Remarkably, the 
President’s defense is wrapping them-
selves in Rudy Giuliani’s involvement 
in Ukraine while trying to minimize 
his role. 
There is overwhelming evidence—not 
just testimony but texts, call records, 
and other corroborating documents— 
establishing Mr. Giuliani’s key role in 
executing 
the 
President’s 
pressure 
campaign beginning in early spring 
2019 with a smear campaign against 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch 
and 
then 
throughout 
the 
summer. 
Everyone 
knew that Rudy Giuliani was the gate-
keeper to the President on Ukraine. 
On May 10, Mr. Giuliani canceled the 
trip to Ukraine, during which he 
planned to dig up dirt on former Vice 
President Biden and on a discredited 
conspiracy theory after his plans be-
came public. He admitted: ‘‘We’re not 
meddling in an election, we’re med-
dling in an investigation.’’ He ex-
plained that someone can say it is im-
proper, 
and 
this 
isn’t—‘‘[Someone] 
could say it’s improper. And this isn’t 
foreign policy—I’m asking them to do 
an investigation that they’re already 
doing and that other people are telling 
them to stop.’’ He was talking about 
the investigations of the Bidens. 
During a May 10 appearance on FOX 
News, Giuliani also said that he can-
celed his trip because there are en-
emies of Trump’s around President 
Zelensky. 
Mr. Giuliani’s associate Lev Parnas 
produced a set of documents to the 
House Intelligence Committee that in-
cluded a letter—and I believe we have 
slide 50 here—Mr. Giuliani sent to 
President-elect Zelensky during this 
time period. In the letter dated May 10, 
Mr. Giuliani informed Zelensky that he 
represented President Trump as a pri-
vate citizen, not as President of the 
United States. 
He also requested a meeting with 
President Zelensky on May 13 and 14, 
along with Victoria Toensing, in his 
‘‘capacity as personal counsel to Presi-
dent Trump and with his knowledge 
and consent.’’ 
Mr. Giuliani confirmed President 
Trump’s knowledge of actions with re-
gard to Ukraine, stating: ‘‘He . . . 
knows what I’m doing, sure, as his law-
yer.’’ He added: 
My only client is the president of the 
United States. He’s the one I have an obliga-
tion to report to, tell him what happened. 
President 
Trump 
repeatedly 
in-
structed senior American and Ukrain-
ian officials to talk to Rudy, dem-
onstrating that Mr. Giuliani was a key 
player in the corrupt scheme. 
In the May 23 Oval Office meeting to 
discuss 
Ukraine 
policy, 
President 
Trump directed his handpicked three 
amigos to talk to Rudy. In response, 
Ambassador Sondland testified: ‘‘Sec-
retary Perry, Ambassador Volker and I 
worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on 
Ukraine matters at the express direc-
tion of the President of the United 
States.’’ 
After two explosive White House 
meetings on July 10 in which Ambas-
sador Sondland explicitly conveyed the 
President’s demand for political inves-
tigations to Ukrainian officials, top 
Ukrainian aide Andriy Yermak texted 
Ambassador Volker: ‘‘I feel that the 
key for many things is Rudy.’’ 
And what was Rudy asking? Inves-
tigations of two American citizens— 
not corruption in general; investiga-
tions. In fact, he wasn’t even asking for 
an investigation; he was just asking for 
an announcement of an investigation 
so 
that 
American 
citizens—the 
Bidens—could be smeared. 
On the July 25 call with President 
Zelensky, President Trump mentioned 
Rudy Giuliani by name no less than 
four times and informed Zelensky that 
Rudy very much knows what is hap-
pening. He told President Zelensky: 
‘‘Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected 
man.’’ He added, ‘‘Rudy very much 
knows what is happening.’’ 
In August, Mr. Giuliani met with a 
top Ukrainian aide and conveyed that 
Ukraine must issue a public statement 
announcing investigations. 
Ambassador Sondland and Volker 
then worked closely with Giuliani and 
the Ukrainians to ensure that the 
planned statement would meet Mr. 
Giuliani’s demands. Specifically, Mr. 
Giuliani insisted that the statement 
include specific references to Burisma 
and the 2016 election and Biden. 
Throughout this process, Sondland 
stated that he knew that they needed 
the approval of Giuliani for the press 
statement and that they knew Giuliani 
represented the interest of the Presi-
dent. 
Rudy Giuliani admitted on live tele-
vision to pressuring Ukraine to look 
into Joe Biden—not into corruption; 
into Joe Biden. 
In September 2019, Chris Cuomo 
asked 
Giuliani: 
‘‘So 
you 
did 
ask 
Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?’’ 
In response, Giuliani insisted: ‘‘Of 
course I did.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S684 
January 29, 2020 
Mr. Giuliani insisted that Ukraine 
look at an American citizen on behalf 
of his client, President Trump. 
Finally, during the pendency of the 
impeachment proceedings, Mr. Giuliani 
has not ceased in his efforts to dig up 
dirt to benefit the President. 
In December, he again traveled to 
Ukraine to meet with Ukrainian offi-
cials, which he described as a secret as-
signment, and after which, the Presi-
dent reportedly called him imme-
diately upon landing and asked, ‘‘What 
did you get?’’ to which Mr. Giuliani re-
sponded, ‘‘More than you can imag-
ine.’’ 
It is worth noting that in Ms. 
Raskin’s 
presentation 
about 
Giuliani—— 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. Manager NADLER.—he repeated 
requests for investigations into Biden, 
not into corruption. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. I send a question to the 
desk on behalf of myself, Senators 
SASSE, BRAUN, RISCH, MCSALLY, ROB-
ERTS, and HOEVEN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator RUBIO and 
the other Senators is for counsel for 
the President: 
How would the Framers view removing a 
President without an overwhelming con-
sensus of the American people and on the 
basis of Articles of Impeachment supported 
by one political party and opposed by the 
other? 
Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief 
Justice, thank you. 
Senators, Alexander Hamilton ad-
dressed that issue very directly. He 
said the greatest danger of impeach-
ment is if it turns on the votes of one 
party being greater than the votes of 
another party in either House. So I 
think they would be appalled to see an 
impeachment going forward in viola-
tion of the Schumer rule and the rules 
of other Congressmen that were good 
enough for us during the Clinton im-
peachment but seemed to have changed 
dramatically in the current situation. 
The criteria that have been set out 
are so lawless, they basically para-
phrase 
Congresswoman 
MAXINE 
WATERS, who said: There is no law. 
Anything the House wants to do to im-
peach is impeachable. That is what is 
happening 
today. 
That 
places 
the 
House of Representatives above the 
law. 
We have heard much about, no one is 
above the law. The House of Represent-
atives is not above the law. They may 
not use the MAXINE WATERS—Gerald 
Ford made the same point, but it was 
about the impeachment of a judge. 
Judges are different; there are many of 
them. There is only one President. 
But to use that criteria, that it is 
whatever the House says it is, whatever 
the Senate says it is, turns those bod-
ies into lawless bodies, in violation of 
the intent of the Framers. 
Manager SCHIFF confused my argu-
ment when he talked about intent and 
motive. 
You have said I am not a constitu-
tional lawyer, but you admitted I am a 
criminal lawyer. And I have taught 
criminal law for 50 years at Harvard. 
There is an enormous distinction be-
tween intent and motive. If somebody 
shoots somebody, the intent is that 
when you pull the trigger, you know a 
bullet will leave and will hit somebody 
and may kill them. That is the intent 
to kill them. Motive can be revenge. It 
could be money. It almost never is 
taken into consideration, except in ex-
treme cases. There are cases where mo-
tive counts. 
But let’s consider a hypothetical 
growing out of a situation that we have 
discussed. Let’s assume that President 
Obama had been told by his advisers 
that it really is important to send le-
thal weapons to the Ukraine, but then 
he gets a call from his pollster and his 
political adviser, who says: We know it 
is in the national interest to send le-
thal weapons to the Ukraine, but we 
are telling you that the leftwing of 
your party is really going to give you a 
hard time if you start selling lethal 
weapons and getting into a lethal war, 
potentially, with Russia. Would any-
body here suggest that was impeach-
able? Or let’s assume President Obama 
said: I promised to bomb Syria if they 
had chemical weapons, but I am now 
told by my pollsters that bombing 
Syria would hurt my electoral chances. 
Certainly not impeachable at all. 
So let me apply that to the current 
situation. As you know, I said pre-
viously there are three levels of pos-
sible motive. 
One is, the motive is pure—only in-
terest is in the way of what is good for 
the country. In the real world, that 
rarely happens. 
The other one is, the motive is com-
pletely corrupt—I want money, kick-
back. 
But then there is the third one that 
is so complicated and that is often mis-
understood. When you have a mixed 
motive—a motive in which you think 
you are doing good for the country, but 
you are also doing good for yourself. 
You are doing good for me; you are 
doing good for thee. You are doing 
good, and you altogether put it in a 
bundle in which you are satisfied that 
you are doing absolutely the right 
thing. Let me give you a perfect exam-
ple of that from the case. 
The argument has been made that 
the President of the United States only 
became interested in corruption when 
he learned that Joe Biden was running 
for 
President. 
Let’s 
assume 
hypo-
thetically that the President was in his 
second term, and he said to himself: 
You know, Joe Biden is running for 
President. I really should now get con-
cerned about whether his son is corrupt 
because he is not only a candidate—he 
is not running against me; I am fin-
ished with my term—but he could be 
the President of the United States. And 
if he is the President of the United 
States and he has a corrupt son, the 
fact that he has announced his can-
didacy is a very good reason for upping 
the interest in his son. If he wasn’t 
running for President, he is a has-been. 
He is the former Vice President of the 
United States. OK, big deal. But if he is 
running for President, that is an enor-
mous big deal. 
So the difference—the House man-
agers would make—is whether the 
President is in his first term or in his 
second term, whether he is running for 
reelection or not running for reelec-
tion. I think they would have to con-
cede that, if he was not running for re-
election, this would not be a cross mo-
tive but would be a mixed motive but 
leaning on the side of national interest. 
If he is running for reelection, suddenly 
that turns it into an impeachable of-
fense. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Thank you, counsel. 
The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I submit a question to the desk di-
rected to the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question is from Senator KLO-
BUCHAR to the House managers: 
I was on the trial committee for the last 
impeachment trial in the Senate, which in-
volved Judge Thomas Porteous, who was ul-
timately removed. During that time, the 
Senate trial committee heard from 26 wit-
nesses, 17 of whom had not previously testi-
fied in the House. What possible reason could 
there be for allowing 26 witnesses in a judi-
cial impeachment trial and hearing none for 
a President’s trial? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator, as you know, I am quite 
familiar with the Porteous impeach-
ment. Someone asked me the last time 
I tried a case. The answer is probably 
30 years ago except for the impeach-
ment of Thomas Porteous, when I last 
spent some quality time with you. 
There is no difference in terms of the 
Constitution. I would say that the need 
for witnesses in the impeachment trial 
of a President of the United States is a 
far more compelling circumstance than 
the impeachment of a judge. Now, you 
might say, well, in the impeachment of 
a judge, how is it possible that the 
time of the Senate could be occupied 
by calling witnesses; that, as precious 
as your time is, we would occupy your 
time calling dozens of witnesses, but in 
the impeachment of a President, it is 
not worth the time; it is too much of 
an imposition. 
Again, I would argue that the imper-
ative of calling judges and having a fair 
trial when we are adjudicating the 
guilt of a President of the United 
States is paramount. 
Now, we have always argued that the 
trial should be fair to the President 
and the American people. And, yes, it 
is a big deal to impeach a President 
and remove that President from office. 
It is also a big deal if you leave in place 
a President when the House has proven 
that President has committed im-
peachable misconduct and is likely to

continue committing it—because there 
is no doubt, I think, from the record 
that not only did the President solicit 
Russian interference in 2016 but solic-
ited Ukraine’s interference in the up-
coming election, solicited China’s in-
terference—as my colleague just said, 
had Rudy Giuliani, his personal agent, 
in Ukraine doing the same kind of 
thing just last month. 
And Senator, in response to that 
question, 
isn’t 
it 
dispositive 
that 
Giuliani, the personal agent of the 
President, is running this Biden oper-
ation rather than any department of 
government? Isn’t that really disposi-
tive of whether this was policy or poli-
tics? And I think the answer is yes. 
Giuliani has made it abundantly 
clear: I am not here doing foreign pol-
icy. That is the President’s own law-
yer. I am not here to do foreign policy. 
Now, Professor Dershowitz just made 
a rather astounding argument that an 
investigation of Joe Biden that is un-
warranted, unmerited, suddenly be-
comes warranted if he runs for Presi-
dent. Now, he posited that in the Presi-
dent’s second term, but it doesn’t mat-
ter whether he is in his first term or 
his second term. An illegitimate inves-
tigation of Joe Biden doesn’t somehow 
become legitimate because he is run-
ning for President unless you view 
your interests as synonymous with the 
Nation’s interests. 
I think it is the most profound con-
flict for a President of one party, 
whether he is running for reelection or 
not, to suggest that all of a sudden an 
investigation of a leading candidate in 
the opposite party is justified because 
now they are running for President. I 
mean, you really have to step aside 
from what is going on to imagine that 
anyone could make that argument; 
that running for office, running for 
President now, means that you are a 
more justified target of investigation 
than when you weren’t. That cannot 
be. That cannot be. But that is essen-
tially what is being argued here. 
To get to conclude, Senator, the case 
for witnesses in a Presidential im-
peachment where either, on the one 
side, you remove a President or, on the 
other side, you leave in place a Presi-
dent who may pose a continuing risk to 
the country is far more compelling to 
take the time to hear from witnesses 
than a corrupt Louisiana judge who 
only impacts those who come before 
his court. 
All of us come before the court of the 
American people. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself and Senator LANKFORD and Sen-
ator HAWLEY. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators DAINES, 
LANKFORD, and HAWLEY is for counsel 
for the President: 
Over the past 244 years, eight judges have 
been removed from office by the U.S. Senate 
but never a President. The eight judges have 
been removed for bribery, perjury, tax eva-
sion, waging war against the United States, 
and other unlawful actions. How do the cur-
rent impeachment articles differ from pre-
vious convictions and removals by the Sen-
ate? 
Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief 
Justice, there is an enormous dif-
ference between impeaching and re-
moving a judge, even a justice, and im-
peaching and removing a President. No 
judge, not even a Chief Justice, is the 
judicial branch. You are the head of 
the judicial branch, but there is a judi-
cial branch. 
The 
President 
is 
the 
executive 
branch. He is irreplaceable. There isn’t 
always a Vice President. Remember, 
we had a period of time when there was 
no Vice President. We needed a con-
stitutional amendment. 
So there is no comparison between 
impeaching a judge and impeaching a 
President. Moreover, there is a textual 
difference. The Constitution provides 
that judges serve during good behavior. 
That is the Congressman SCHIFF stand-
ard, and it is a great standard. We wish 
everybody served only during good be-
havior. But the Constitution doesn’t 
say that the President shall serve dur-
ing good behavior. The big difference is 
the President runs every 4 years, and 
the public gets to judge his good behav-
ior. Judges don’t run, and so there is 
only one judge of the good behavior; 
namely, the impeachment process. 
So to make a comparison is to make 
the same mistake that when people 
compare the British system to the 
American system. We have heard a lot 
of argument that we adopted the Brit-
ish system by adopting five words: 
‘‘other 
high 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors.’’ Yes, those words may 
have been borrowed from Great Brit-
ain, but the whole concept of impeach-
ment was not. First of all, impeach-
ment no longer exists in Great Britain; 
but when it did, it only operated for 
low-level and middle-level people. All 
the impeachment trials that have been 
cited involve this guy in India, this guy 
in the commerce, this guy here, this 
guy there—utterly replaceable people. 
In the British system, on the other 
hand, you can get rid of the head of 
state—the head of government, rather, 
by a simple vote of no confidence. That 
is what the Framers rejected. The 
Framers rejected that for a President. 
And so the notion that we borrowed the 
British system has it exactly back-
ward. We rejected the British system. 
We did not want a President to serve 
at the pleasure of the legislature. We 
wanted the President to serve at the 
pleasure of the voters. 
Judges don’t serve at the pleasure of 
the voters, so there needs to be dif-
ferent criteria and broader criteria, 
and those criteria have been used in 
practice. For the most part, judges 
have been impeached for criminal and 
removed for criminal behavior. 
But take an example that was given. 
If a judge is completely drunk and in-
capacitated and cannot do his job, it is 
easy to imagine how a judge might 
have to be removed for that. 
But 
the 
President—there 
is 
an 
amendment to the Constitution, the 
25th Amendment, specifically provided 
because there was a gap in the Con-
stitution. And, please, Members of the 
Senate, it is important to understand, 
your role is not to fill gaps that the 
Framers deliberately left open. 
Good arguments have been made: 
Why is it important to make sure peo-
ple don’t abuse their power, people 
don’t commit maladministration? But 
the Framers left open, left those gaps. 
Your job is not to fill in the gaps. Your 
job is to apply the Constitution as the 
Framers wrote it, and that doesn’t in-
clude abuse of power and obstruction of 
Congress. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk for the Presi-
dent’s counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator COONS to 
the President’s counsel is this: 
The President’s brief states, ‘‘Congress has 
forbidden foreigners’ involvement in Amer-
ican elections.’’ However, in June 2019, Presi-
dent Trump said if Russia or China offered 
information on his opponent, ‘‘[t]here’s noth-
ing wrong with listening,’’ and he might not 
alert the FBI because: ‘‘Give me a break. 
Life doesn’t work that way.’’ Does President 
Trump agree with your statement that for-
eigners’ involvement in American elections 
is illegal? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
I think Congress has specified spe-
cific ways in which foreigners cannot 
be involved in elections. Foreigners 
can’t vote in elections. There are re-
strictions on foreign contributions to 
campaigns—things like that. 
When the whistleblower originally 
made a complaint about this July 25 
call, and that was reviewed by the in-
spector general for the intelligence 
community, he framed that whistle-
blower’s complaint and wrote a cover 
letter framing it in terms of those 
laws. And he said that there might be 
an issue here related to soliciting a for-
eign contribution to a campaign, a 
thing of value, foreign campaign inter-
ference. 
That was specifically reviewed by the 
Department of Justice. The Depart-
ment of Justice concluded that there 
was no such violation here. So that is 
not something that is involved in this 
case. 
President Trump’s interview with 
ABC that you cited does not involve 
something that is a foreign campaign 
contribution, something that is ad-
dressed by the law as passed by Con-
gress. He was referring to the possi-
bility that information could come 
from a source, and I think he pointed 
out in that interview that he might 
contact the FBI, he might listen to 
something.

January 29, 2020 
But mere information is not some-
thing that would violate the campaign 
finance laws. And if there is credible 
information, credible information of 
wrongdoing by someone who is running 
for a public office—it is not campaign 
interference for credible information 
about wrongdoing to be brought to 
light, if it is credible information. 
So I think that the idea that any in-
formation that happens to come from 
overseas is necessarily campaign inter-
ference is a mistake. That is a non se-
quitur. Information that is credible, 
that potentially shows wrongdoing by 
someone who happens to be running for 
office, if it is credible information, is 
relevant information for the voters to 
know about, for people to be able to de-
cide on who is the best candidate for an 
office. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you,

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice,

There being no objection, at 9:44

Impeachment, recessed until 10:07 p.m.; 
whereupon

Senate

when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
my understanding is we will finish up 
at about 11 p.m. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Senator from Georgia. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. I send a letter to 
the desk on behalf of myself, Senators 
BLACKBURN, 
HYDE-SMITH, 
COTTON, 
HAWLEY, BARRASSO, PERDUE, FISCHER, 
and CORNYN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator LOEFFLER 
and Senators BLACKBURN, HYDE-SMITH, 
COTTON, HAWLEY, BARRASSO, PERDUE, 
FISCHER, and CORNYN is for counsel for 
the President: 
As a fact witness who was coordinating 
with 
the 
whistleblower, 
did 
Manager 
SCHIFF’s handling of the impeachment in-
quiry create material due process issues for 
the President to have a fair trial? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
And I believe the short answer is yes, 
it did create a material due process 
issue. And as I explained the other day 
in a portion of my argument, there 
were three major due process viola-
tions: the lack of an authorization, so 
that the whole proceeding started in an 
illegitimate and constitutionally in-
valid manner; second, the lack of basic 
due process protections related to fun-
damental rights to present evidence, 
cross-examine witnesses, present wit-
nesses; and the final one is that Man-
ager SCHIFF or his staff had some role 
in consulting with the whistleblower 
that remains secret to this day. And all 
attempts to find out about that, to ask 
questions about that were shut down. 
Manager SCHIFF said today that he had 
no contact with the whistleblower, 
that it was only his staff. But the ex-
tent to which there was some consulta-
tion there hasn’t actually been probed 
by any question. 
All the questions that Republican 
Members of the House tried to ask 
about that were shut down. And any 
questions as a result of questions into 
determining who the whistleblower was 
and what his motivations and bias were 
also shut down. 
The inspector general for the intel-
ligence community noted—we heard 
that earlier this evening—in his letter 
to the Acting Director of the DNI that 
the whistleblower had the indicia of po-
litical bias because the whistleblower 
had connections with a Presidential 
candidate of another party. 
But the testimony from the inspector 
general of the intelligence community 
remains secret. It was in executive ses-
sion. It hasn’t been forwarded from 
HPSCI to the House Judiciary Com-
mittee and, therefore, is not part of the 
RECORD here. There hasn’t been any 
ability to probe into the relationships 
between the whistleblower and others 
who are materially relevant to the 
issues in this inquiry. 
If the whistleblower, as is alleged in 
some public reports, actually did work 
for 
then-Vice 
President 
Biden 
on 
Ukraine issues, exactly what was his 
role? What was his involvement when 
issues were raised? We know from tes-
timony the questions were raised about 
the potential conflict of interest that 
the Vice President then had when his 
son was sitting on the board of 
Burisma. Was the alleged whistle-
blower involved in any of that and in 
making decisions to not do anything 
related to that? Did he have some rea-
son to want to put the deep six on any 
question raising any issue about what 
went on with the Bidens and Burisma 
and firing Shokin and withholding $1 
billion in loan guarantees and in forc-
ing a very explicit quid pro quo: You 
won’t get this $1 billion until you fire 
him. 
We don’t know. And because Manager 
SCHIFF was guiding this whole process, 
because he was the chairman in charge 
of directing the inquiry and directing 
it away from any of those questions, 
that creates a real due process defect 
in the record that has been presented 
here. 
So yes, that is a major problem and 
major defect in the way the House pro-
ceedings occurred that infects this 
record. It means that it is not a record 
that could be relied upon to reach any 
conclusion other than an acquittal for 
the President. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
have a question for the House man-
agers that I will send to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator PETERS asks the House man-
agers: 
Does an impeachable abuse of power re-
quire that a President’s corrupt plan actu-
ally succeed? 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, the answer is no. 
Just as, although this is not a criminal 
offense, if you attempted murder but 
didn’t succeed, you would not be inno-
cent. The President has attempted to 
upend the constitutional order for his 
own personal benefit. He used the pow-
ers of the—let’s put up slide 11, if we 
could. He has used the powers of his of-
fice to solicit foreign interference, and 
we know this by the President’s own 
statements, the Acting Chief of Staff’s 
confession, substantial documentary 
evidence, and witness testimony. And 
this has grave consequences for our na-
tional security, for threatened election 
security, as well as undermining U.S. 
credibility and our values abroad. 
Now, because the President continues 
to act in this manner, we believe that 
this is an ongoing threat. While the im-
peachment was going on, the Presi-
dent’s personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani, 
was 
in 
Ukraine, 
continuing 
this 
scheme, and when he landed—he was 
still taxiing—the President and he 
were on the phone. 
The President was asking him: What 
did you get? What did you get? 
So this is an ongoing matter. The 
fact that he had to release the aid after 
his scheme was revealed does not end 
the problem. 
I have listened with great interest to 
the back-and-forth in the questions. It 
is hard because I want to get up and 
answer all of the questions, and I can’t, 
but I do think that the President has 
made it clear that he believes he can do 
whatever 
he 
wants—whatever 
he 
wants—and there is no constraint that 
is being recognized by the Congress. 
Mr. Mulvaney, as we have noted, has 
acknowledged that the President di-
rectly tied his hold on military aid to 
his desire to get Ukraine to conduct a 
political investigation, and he told us 
to just get over it. 
The President’s lawyers have sug-
gested we should not believe our eyes 
because Mr. Mulvaney—when I was a 
kid, they would say: Don’t believe your 
lying eyes—walked that back later. We 
have an opportunity, actually, to hear 
from a witness who directly spoke to 
the President, who, apparently, can 
tell us that the President told him that 
the only reason this aid was held up 
was to get dirt on the Democrats. 
If 
we 
just 
think 
about 
it—put 
Ukraine to one side—if a Chief Execu-
tive called the Department of Justice 
and said, ‘‘I want you to investigate 
my political opponents. I want you to 
announce 
an 
investigation,’’ 
there 
wouldn’t be any question that that 
would be an improper use of Presi-
dential power. It is really no different 
when you follow a foreign government 
except that it is worse because one of 
the things that the Founders worried 
about was the involvement of foreign 
governments in our matters, in our 
elections. So, yes, the fact that he

didn’t succeed in that particular in-
stance does not mean that we are safe. 
I was stunned to hear that now, ap-
parently, it is OK for the President to 
get information from foreign govern-
ments in an election. That is news to 
me, you know, that the election cam-
paign laws prohibit accepting anything 
of value. A thing of value is informa-
tion. If you or I accepted material in-
formation from a source—an email, a 
database, and the like—without paying 
for it or from a foreign nation, that 
would be illegal; but the thought that 
this—as we go forward in this trial 
itself, we are creating additional dan-
gers to the Nation by suggesting that 
things that have long been prohibited 
are now suddenly going to be OK be-
cause they have been asserted in the 
President’s defense. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself and Senators RISCH, HAWLEY, 
and MORAN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question is from Senators BAR-
RASSO, RISCH, HAWLEY, and MORAN for 
counsel to the President: 
Can the Senate convict a sitting U.S. 
President of obstruction of Congress for ex-
ercising the President’s constitutional au-
thorities or rights? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice and Senators, thank you for the 
question. 
I think the short answer is, constitu-
tionally, no, the Senate may not con-
vict the President for exercising his 
constitutional authorities. 
The theory that the House managers 
have 
presented—I 
think 
Professor 
Turley, in testifying before the House, 
made it very clear—is itself an abuse of 
power by Congress and is dangerous for 
the structure of our government be-
cause the fundamental proposition at 
the heart of the obstruction of Con-
gress charge that the House managers 
have brought is that the House can 
simply demand information. 
If the executive branch resists, even 
if it provides lawful rationales—per-
haps ones that the House managers dis-
agree with but that are consistent with 
longstanding precedents and principles 
applied by the executive branch—and if 
the House managers disagree with 
them, they jump immediately to im-
peaching the President. That is dan-
gerous for our structure of govern-
ment. We are talking about principles 
here—one based on simply the failure 
of the House to proceed lawfully. 
We have heard a lot about the Presi-
dent is not above the law, but as Pro-
fessor Dershowitz pointed out, the 
House of Representatives is not above 
the law. It has to turn square corners. 
It has to proceed by the proper meth-
ods to issue subpoenas to the executive 
branch. 
So, if the House has an issue about 
subpoenas and if the House attempts to 
subpoena a senior adviser to the Presi-
dent and the President asserts the im-
munity of the senior adviser—a doc-
trine that has been asserted by vir-
tually every President since President 
Nixon and goes back earlier than 
that—then there is a confrontation be-
tween the branches. That doesn’t sug-
gest an impeachable offense. What it 
suggests—what it shows—is a separa-
tion of powers in operation. That fric-
tion between the branches is part of 
the constitutional design. 
It was Justice Louis Brandeis who 
explained that the separation of powers 
was enshrined in the Constitution not 
because it was the most efficient way 
to have government, but because the 
friction that it caused and the inter-
action between the branches was part 
of a way of guaranteeing liberty by en-
suring that no one branch could ag-
grandize power to itself. 
What the House managers are sug-
gesting here is directly antithetical to 
that fundamental principle. What they 
are suggesting is, once they decide 
they want to pursue impeachment and 
when they make demands for informa-
tion to the Executive, the Executive 
has no defenses. It can have no con-
stitutional authorities or prerogatives 
to raise in response to those subpoenas. 
It has to just turn over everything or it 
is an impeachable offense. What that 
would lead to, as Professor Turley ex-
plained, is transforming our system of 
government by elevating the House and 
making it, really, a parliamentary sys-
tem. 
As Professor Dershowitz was explain-
ing, in the parliamentary system, the 
Prime Minister can simply be removed 
by a vote of no confidence, but if you 
make it so easy to impeach the Presi-
dent—all the House has to do is de-
mand some information, goad a re-
sponse from a President that this is 
contrary to the principles that all 
Presidents before me have asserted, 
and I am going to stick by the execu-
tive branch’s prerogatives—then the 
House can say: Well, that is it. You 
will be impeached. 
If the votes are there to remove the 
President, you make the President de-
pendent on the legislature, and that is 
what 
Gouverneur 
Morris 
warned 
against specifically during the Con-
stitutional Convention. He warned the 
Framers, when we make a method for 
making the President amenable to jus-
tice, we should make sure that we do 
not make him dependent on the legisla-
ture. 
It was the parliamentary system’s 
making it easy to remove the Chief Ex-
ecutive that the Framers wanted to re-
ject, and this theory of obstruction of 
Congress would create exactly that 
system of easy removal, effectively a 
parliamentary system of a vote of no 
confidence. That is not the structure of 
the government that the Framers en-
shrined in the Constitution for us. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you, Mr. 
Chief Justice. 
Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question 
to the desk on behalf of myself and 
Senators WARNER, HEINRICH, and HAR-
RIS. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The 
question 
from 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL
and Senators WARNER, 
HEINRICH, and HARRIS reads as follows: 
Before the break, the President’s Counsel 
stated that accepting ‘‘mere information’’ 
from a foreign source is not something that 
would violate campaign finance law, and 
that it is not campaign interference to ac-
cept ‘‘credible information’’ from a foreign 
source about someone who is running for of-
fice. Under this view, acceptance of the kinds 
of propaganda disseminated by Russia in 
2016—on Facebook and other social media 
platforms, using bots, fake accounts and 
other techniques to spread disinformation— 
would be perfectly legal and appropriate. 
Isn’t it true that accepting such a thing of 
value is, in fact, a violation of law? And isn’t 
it true that it is one of the highest priorities 
of our Intelligence Community, including 
the CIA, NSA, DNI, and FBI, to do every-
thing possible to prevent such foreign inter-
ference or intervention in our elections? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. It is, without 
question, among the very highest pri-
orities of our intelligence agencies and 
our law enforcement to prevent foreign 
interference in our election of the type 
and character that we saw in 2016. 
When Russia hacked the databases of 
the Democratic National Committee— 
the DCCC—when they began a cam-
paign of leaking those documents and 
when it engaged in a massive and sys-
temic social media campaign, our intel 
agencies and law enforcement had been 
devoting themselves to preventing a re-
currence of that type of foreign inter-
ference. 
If I am understanding counsel and 
the President correctly—and I think 
that I am—they are saying that not 
only is that OK to willingly accept 
that but that the very allegation 
against the President that Bob Mueller 
spent 
2 
years 
investigating 
didn’t 
amount to criminal conspiracy. That 
is, Did he prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt the crime of conspiracy? Again, 
we are talking about something sepa-
rate from collusion here, although my 
colleagues keep confusing the two. Bob 
Mueller didn’t address the issue of col-
lusion. What he did address was wheth-
er he could prove the elements of 
criminal conspiracy, and he found that 
he could not. 
What counsel for the President is 
now saying is that, even if he could 
have, that is OK. It is now OK to crimi-
nally conspire with another country to 
get help in a Presidential election, as 
long as the President believes it would 
help his campaign, and, therefore, it 
would help our country. That is now 
OK. It is OK to ask for that help. It is 
OK to work with that power to get that 
help. That is now OK. 
It has been a remarkable evolution of 
the Presidential defense. It began with 
‘‘none of that stuff happened here.’’ It 
began with ‘‘nothing to see here.’’ It 
migrated to, OK, they did seek inves-
tigations of the President’s political

rival, and then it became, OK, those in-
vestigations were not sought by official 
channels to official policy. They were 
sought by the President’s lawyer in his 
personal capacity. Then it migrated to, 
OK, we acknowledge that, while the 
President’s lawyer was conducting this 
personal political errand, the President 
withheld the money, but we think that 
is OK. 
We have witnessed over the course of 
the last few days and the long day 
today a remarkable lowering of the bar 
to the point now where everything is 
OK as long as the President believes it 
is in his reelection interest. You could 
conspire with another country to get 
its help in your election either by its 
intervening on your behalf to help you 
or by its intervening to hurt your oppo-
nent. 
Now, we are told that that is not 
only OK, but it is beyond the reach of 
the Constitution. Why? Because abuse 
of power is not impeachable. If you say 
abuse of power is impeachable, well, 
then, you are impeaching Presidents 
for mere policy. Well, that is nonsense. 
They are not the same thing. 
They are not the same thing as Pro-
fessor Turley has argued. They are not 
the same thing as Bill Barr has argued. 
They are not the same thing as Pro-
fessor Dershowitz argued 21 years ago, 
and they are not the same thing today. 
They are just not. You can’t solicit for-
eign interference, and the fact that you 
are unsuccessful in getting it doesn’t 
exonerate 
you. 
The 
failed 
scheme 
doesn’t make you innocent. 
A failed scheme doesn’t make you in-
nocent. If you take a hostage and you 
demand a ransom and the police are 
after you and you release the hostage 
before you get the money, it doesn’t 
make you innocent. It just makes you 
unsuccessful—an unsuccessful crook— 
but it doesn’t mitigate the harmful 
conduct. 
And this body should not accept nor 
should the American people accept the 
idea put out by the President’s lawyers 
today that it is perfectly fine—unim-
peachable—for the President of the 
United States to say ‘‘Hey, Russia’’ or 
‘‘Hey, Ukraine’’ or ‘‘Hey, China, I want 
your help in my election’’ because that 
is the policy of the President. We are 
calling that policy now. It is the policy 
of the President to demand foreign in-
terference and withhold money from an 
ally at war unless they get it. That is 
what they call policy. 
I am sorry; that is what I call corrup-
tion, and they can dress it up in fine 
legalese, but corruption is still corrup-
tion. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator COLLINS is 
for the House managers: 
The House Judiciary Committee report ac-
companying the Articles of Impeachment as-
serted the President committed criminal 
bribery as defined in 18 U.S.C., section 201, 
and Honest Services Fraud as defined in 18 
U.S.C., section 1346, but these offenses are 
not cited in the Articles of Impeachment. 
Did the President’s actions as alleged in the 
Articles of Impeachment constitute viola-
tions of these Federal criminal laws, and if 
so, why were they not included in the Arti-
cles? 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Thank you, 
Chief Justice, and thank you, Senator, 
for your question. 
Our article I alleges corrupt abuse of 
power—corrupt abuse of power con-
nected to the President’s effort to try 
to cheat in the 2020 election by pres-
suring Ukraine to target an American 
citizen, Joe Biden, solely for personal 
and political gain and then to solicit 
foreign interference in the 2020 elec-
tion. And the scheme was executed in a 
variety of ways. 
Now, Professor Dershowitz has indi-
cated, based on his theory of what is 
impeachable, that it has to either be a 
technical criminal violation, though 
the weight of constitutional authority 
says the contrary, but he said that it 
should be something that is either a 
criminal violation or something akin 
to a criminal violation—akin to a 
criminal violation. 
And what we allege in article I falls 
into that category because what hap-
pened here is that President Trump so-
licited a thing of value in exchange for 
an official act. The thing of value was 
phony political dirt in the form of an 
investigation 
sought 
against 
Joe 
Biden, his political opponent, and he 
asked for it explicitly on that July 25 
call and through his intermediaries re-
peatedly in the spring, throughout the 
summer, into the fall—solicited a thing 
of value in exchange for two official 
acts. 
One official act was the release of 
$391 million in security aid that was 
passed by this Senate and by the House 
on a bipartisan basis, and the President 
withheld it without justification. Wit-
nesses said there was no legitimate 
public policy reason, no legitimate sub-
stantive reason, no legitimate foreign 
policy or national security reason for 
withholding the aid. It was withheld to 
solicit foreign interference. 
Yes, that is akin to a crime. That is 
your standard, sir. 
The President also solicited that po-
litical dirt in exchange for a second of-
ficial act: the White House meeting 
that the Ukrainian leader desperately 
wanted—so much so that he mentioned 
it on the July 25 call, and even when 
President Trump met with President 
Zelensky at the sidelines of the U.N. in 
late 
September, 
the 
President 
of 
Ukraine brought up the Oval Office 
meeting again because it was valuable 
to him. The President withheld it— 
withheld that official act—to solicit 
foreign interference in the 2020 elec-
tion. 
That is not acceptable in America. 
That undermines our democracy. That 
is a stunning, corrupt abuse of power. 
And yes, sir, it is akin to a crime. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I send a question to the desk on 
behalf of Senators CASEY, MURPHY, 
ROSEN, and myself for the House man-
agers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Senator from New York. 
The question from Senators GILLI-
BRAND, CASEY, MURPHY, and ROSEN is 
to the House managers: 
How do the President’s actions differ from 
other holds, and how is the hold and release 
of congressionally appropriated assistance to 
foreign countries supposed to work? 
Mr. Manager CROW. Chief Justice, 
thank you, Senators, for the question. 
To be very clear, what the President 
did is not the same as a routine with-
holding or reviewing of foreign aid to 
ensure that it aligns with the Presi-
dent’s policy priorities or to adjust the 
geopolitical developments because, in-
deed, if that were the case, if the Presi-
dent had engaged that process, had 
gone through the interagency review 
process, had gone through the routine 
congressional certification process, we 
would have the documents, we would 
have the testimony, we would have the 
facts to back that up. 
But, indeed, what we have are none 
of those facts, none of those docu-
ments, and in an almost 2-month pe-
riod, none of the individuals who would 
normally be involved in that process 
were aware of the reason for the hold. 
Now, let’s look at some prior holds in 
the 
cases 
of 
Obama’s—President 
Obama’s—temporary holds. Congress 
was notified of the reasons for those 
holds, and it was always done in the 
national interest, whether it be corrup-
tion, national security, in support of 
our alliances—never the President’s 
own personal interests. 
But let’s look at even President 
Trump’s other holds in Afghanistan be-
cause of concerns about terrorism or in 
Central America because of immigra-
tion concerns. They were done for rea-
sons related to official U.S. policy. 
They weren’t concealed. They were 
public—widely publicized—and had en-
gaged not only Congress but the De-
partment of Defense, Department of 
State, and the entire apparatus that is 
involved in conducting those holds— 
again, none of which happened here. 
So all of this goes to show—the evi-
dence shows that there is no legitimate 
policy reason. Why violate the Im-
poundment Control Act? Why keep all 
of the people involved in these holds in 
the dark? 
The President’s agencies and advisers 
confirmed repeatedly that the aid was 
in the best interests of our country’s 
national security, including Secretary 
Esper, Secretary Pompeo, Vice Presi-
dent PENCE, Ambassador Bolton. Over 
and over again, everybody was implor-
ing the President to release the hold— 
to no avail. 
The evidence also shows that even 
the process was unusual, as I talked 
about earlier, and you have heard, over

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S689 
January 29, 2020 
the last week, a career OMB official, 
Mr. Sandy, explain that Mr. Duffey, 
the President’s handpicked political 
appointee who has refused to testify at 
the President’s direction, took over re-
sponsibility to authorize the aid. 
Mr. Sandy confirmed that, in his en-
tire career at OMB, he had never seen 
or experienced career officials having 
their 
apportionment 
authority 
re-
moved by a political appointee. Sen-
ators, this is what we are talking 
about. There has been a lot of discus-
sion. 
You haven’t heard from me in a little 
while. I suspect there is a reason for 
that. I suspect it is because we don’t 
want to talk about the big issue. We 
don’t want to talk about what hap-
pened here. 
The President abused his authority, 
put the interests of himself over the in-
terests of the country, over the inter-
ests of our national security, over the 
interests of our free and fair elections. 
That is what we are here to talk about. 
That is what happened. That is what 
the evidence shows. 
There is no evidence that shows a le-
gitimate engagement of U.S. policy 
processes to forward legitimate ends. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk on behalf of my-
self, Senators MCCASKILL—MCSALLY, 
rather—LANKFORD—it was a terrifying 
moment—on behalf of myself, Senator 
MCSALLY, Senator LANKFORD, Senator 
GARDNER, Senator CAPITO, and Senator 
WICKER. This is a question for the 
President’s counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator BLUNT 
and other Senators is for the counsel 
for the President: 
What does the supermajority threshold for 
conviction in the Senate, created by the 
Framers, say about the type of case that 
should be brought by the House and the 
standard of proof that should be considered 
in the Senate? 
Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Senators, there were several 
debates among the Framers, of course: 
Should you have impeachment at all? 
We talked about that—what the cri-
teria for impeachment should be. But 
then there was another debate: Who 
should have the ultimate responsibility 
for deciding whether the President 
should be removed? 
James Madison suggested the Su-
preme Court of the United States as a 
completely nonpartisan institution. 
Alexander Hamilton was concerned 
about that issue, as well, but he said 
the Supreme Court would be inappro-
priate because the judicial branch 
should not become involved directly as 
a branch—OK to preside over the 
trial—because 
ultimately 
an 
im-
peached President can be put on trial 
for crimes if he committed crimes. 
And Hamilton said that if he were to 
be put on trial, he would then be put on 
trial in front of the same institution— 
the judiciary—that had already im-
peached him, and they might have a 
predisposition. 
So in the course of the debate, it was 
finally resolved that the Senate, which 
was a very different institution back at 
the founding—obviously, Senators were 
not directly elected; they were ap-
pointed by the legislature. They were 
supposed to serve as an institution 
that checked on the House of Rep-
resentatives—more 
mature, 
more 
sober, elected for longer periods of 
time, with an eye to the future, not so 
concerned about pleasing the popular 
masses. 
Remember, the Framers were very 
concerned about democracy. Nobody 
ever called the United States a democ-
racy—‘‘a Republic, if you can keep it,’’ 
not a democracy—very great concern 
about that. 
And then, when it came time to as-
sign it to the Senate, there was discus-
sion about what the criteria and what 
the—obviously—vote should be. The se-
lection of a two-thirds supermajority 
was 
plainly 
designed—plainly 
de-
signed—to 
avoid 
partisan 
impeach-
ments, plainly designed to effectuate 
the very wise philosophy espoused by 
the Congressman and the Senator dur-
ing the Clinton campaign; that is, dur-
ing the Clinton impeachment. 
Never ever have an impeachment or 
removal that is partisan. Always de-
mand that it be a widespread con-
sensus, a widespread national agree-
ment, and bipartisan support. What 
better way of assuring bipartisan sup-
port than requiring a two-thirds vote 
because almost in every instance, in 
order to get a two-thirds vote, you 
need Members of both parties. 
The Johnson case was a perfect ex-
ample. In order to get that vote, you 
needed not only the party that was be-
hind the impeachment, but you needed 
people from the other side as well, and 
when 
seven 
Republicans 
dissented 
based, I believe, largely on the argu-
ments of Justice Curtis and others—ar-
guments I paraphrased here the other 
day—it lost by merely one vote. The 
Clinton impeachment, if you remember 
correctly, achieved a 50/50 split. Am I 
right about that? I think I am right 
about that. And it only lost—and it 
could have been 51-to-49. It wouldn’t 
have been enough. 
So I think it is plain that not only 
does the two-thirds requirement serve 
as a check on the House, but I think it 
sends a message to every Senator. It 
sends a message even to those Senators 
who would be in the one-third to recon-
sider because if you are voting for a 
partisan impeachment, you are vio-
lating the spirit of the two-thirds re-
quirement. 
There are many institutions where at 
the end of the day—for example, polit-
ical conventions—they seek a unani-
mous vote just to show unity. I would 
urge some Senators who favor im-
peachment to look at the two-thirds 
and say: If there is not going to be a 
two-thirds, there shouldn’t be an im-
peachment, and therefore, we are going 
to vote against impeachment even 
though we might think that the cri-
teria for impeachment has been satis-
fied. 
Do not vote for impeachment, do not 
vote for removal, unless you think the 
criteria articulated by the Senator and 
the Congressman and, I believe, by the 
Constitution and by Hamilton are met, 
namely, bipartisan, almost universal 
concern by the United States of Amer-
ica. That criteria is not met, and the 
two-thirds requirement really illus-
trates the importance the Framers 
gave to that criteria. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
while the question is coming up, I un-
derstand that there are two more 
Democratic questions and two more 
Republican questions. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator MURPHY 
is to the President’s counsel: 
The House Managers have committed to 
abide by rulings by the Chief Justice regard-
ing witness testimony and the admissibility 
of evidence, and that they will not appeal 
such rulings. Will the President’s Counsel 
make the same commitment, thus obviating 
any concerns about an extended trial? 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, we had 
this question. We will say it very clear-
ly. We are not willing to do that, and 
we are not willing to do that because of 
the constitutional framework upon 
which an impeachment is based and the 
constitutional privileges that are at 
stake, with no disrespect at all to the 
Chief Justice. 
That is not the constitutional design. 
It is the same thing they are doing 
again. Surrender the constitutional 
prerogatives you have, and then we 
will proceed in this way. Give us docu-
ments, give us witnesses, and if you 
don’t, we are going to charge you with 
obstruction of Congress. 
In this case, it is ‘‘We are willing to 
live,’’ according to the managers, ‘‘by 
whatever the Chief Justice decides.’’ 
But that is not the way the constitu-
tional framework is set up, and it is 
putting us in exactly the same spot 
again: Give up your right to challenge 
a subpoena in court; rely only on the 
person who is here—by the way, again, 
with no disrespect to the Chief Justice. 
The Chief Justice is here as the Pre-
siding Officer of this proceeding. 
So the President is not willing to 
forgo those rights and privileges that 
he possesses under the Constitution, 
under article II, for expediency. They 
tried that below in the House. We trust 
that will not be the decision here in 
the Senate. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S690 
January 29, 2020 
The Senator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for Pro-
fessor Dershowitz on behalf of myself 
and Senators MCSALLY and MORAN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
for counsel to the President, directed 
to Professor Dershowitz, by Senators 
WICKER, MCSALLY, and MORAN, is this: 
Professor Dershowitz: You stated during 
your presentation that the House grounds for 
impeachment amount to the ‘‘most dan-
gerous precedent.’’ What specific danger does 
this impeachment pose to our republic? To 
its citizens? 
Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, 
Senators. 
I came of age during the period of 
McCarthyism. I then became a young 
professor during the divisive time of 
the Vietnam war. I, as you, lived 
through the division during the Iraq 
war and 9/11 and following 9/11. 
I have never lived at a more divisive 
time in the United States of America 
than today. Families have broken up. 
Friends don’t speak to each other. Dia-
logue has disappeared on university 
campuses. We live in extraordinarily 
dangerous times. I am not suggesting 
that the impeachment decision by the 
House has brought that on us. Perhaps 
it is merely a symptom of a terrific 
problem that we have facing us and 
likely to face us in the future. 
I think it is the responsibility of this 
mature Senate, whose job it is to look 
forward, whose job it is to ensure our 
future, to make sure the divisions 
don’t grow even greater. 
Were the President of the United 
States to be removed today, it would 
pose existential dangers to our ability 
to live together as a people. The deci-
sion would not be accepted by many 
Americans. Nixon’s decision was ac-
cepted—easily accepted. I think that 
decisions that would have been made in 
other cases would be accepted. This one 
would not be easily accepted because it 
is such a divided country, such a di-
vided time. 
If the precedent is established that a 
President can be removed on the basis 
of such vague and recurring and open- 
ended and targeted terms as ‘‘abuse of 
power’’—40 Presidents have been ac-
cused of abuse of power. I bet you all of 
them have. We just don’t know some of 
the charges against some of them, but 
we have documentation on so many. If 
that criteria were to be used, this 
would just be the beginning of a recur-
ring weaponization of impeachment 
whenever one House is controlled by 
one party and the Presidency is con-
trolled by another party. 
Now the House managers say there 
are dangers of not impeaching, but 
those dangers can be eliminated in 8 
months. If you really feel there is a 
strong case, then campaign against the 
President. But the danger of impeach-
ment will last my lifetime, your life-
time, and the lifetime of our children. 
So I urge you respectfully, you are 
the guardians of our future. Follow the 
constraints of the Constitution. Do not 
allow impeachment to become a nor-
malized weapon, in the words of one of 
the Framers. Make sure that it is re-
served only for the most extraordinary 
of cases, like that of Richard Nixon. 
This case does not meet those criteria. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Arizona. 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
submit a question to the President’s 
counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator SINEMA to 
President’s counsel is this: 
The administration notified Congress of 
the hold of the Northern Triangle countries’ 
funds in 2019, announced its decision to with-
hold aid to Afghanistan in September 2019, 
and worked with Congress for months in 2018 
regarding funds being withheld due to Paki-
stan’s lack of progress meeting its counter-
terrorism 
responsibilities. 
In 
these 
in-
stances, the receiving countries knew the 
funds were being withheld to change behav-
ior and further publicly-stated American 
policy. Why, when the administration with-
held the Ukraine security assistance, did it 
not notify Congress, or make Ukraine or 
partner countries publicly aware of the hold 
and the steps needed to resolve the hold? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
I think that, in all of those instances 
that were listed in the question, it was 
clear that withholding the aid was 
meant to send a signal. It was done 
publicly, and it was meant to send a 
signal to the country. I think that in 
the testimony before the House here, 
Ambassador Volker made clear that he 
and others hoped that the hold would 
not become public because they did not 
want there to be any signal to the 
Ukrainians or to others. 
People have talked here—the House 
managers talked about how, well, even 
if the aid, when it was withheld, didn’t 
lead to anything not being purchased 
over the summer, it was still dangerous 
because it sent a signal to the Rus-
sians. The whole point was, it wasn’t 
public. The Ukrainians didn’t know. 
The Russians didn’t know. It wasn’t 
being done to send a signal; it was to 
address concerns. 
The President had raised concerns, 
and he wanted time to have those con-
cerns addressed. He wanted to under-
stand better burden-sharing—the issue 
that is reflected in the June 24 email 
that I referred to earlier; it is referred 
to in the July 25 call transcripts—and 
he wanted to understand corruption 
issues. He raised corruption issues. 
Over the course of the summer, the 
testimony of Mr. Morrison in par-
ticular below explained that there were 
developments on corruption. President 
Zelensky had just been elected in 
April. At that time, multiple witnesses 
testified that it was unclear. He had 
run on a reform agenda, but it was un-
clear what he would be able to accom-
plish because it was unclear whether or 
not he would secure a majority in the 
Ukrainian Parliament. Those elections 
didn’t occur until July. That is when 
the July 25 call occurred. 
He won the majority in Parliament, 
but the Parliament was not actually 
going to be seated until later in Au-
gust. Mr. Morrison testified that when 
he and Ambassador Bolton were in 
Kyiv in August, around August 27, that 
the Parliament had just been seated, 
and Zelensky and his Ministers were 
tired because they had been up all 
night. They kept the Parliament up 
late in session to pass the reform agen-
da right then, including things like 
eliminating immunity for members of 
the Parliament from corruption, pros-
ecutions, and the legislature just set 
up the newly formed corruption court. 
So these developments were positive 
developments, but then Mr. Morrison 
testified that President Zelensky, when 
he spoke to Vice President PENCE in 
Warsaw, discussed these things, and 
President Zelensky went through what 
he was doing, and then that informa-
tion was relayed back to the President. 
So the hold had been in place so that 
the President could, within the U.S. 
Government, privately consider this in-
formation, not to send a signal to the 
outside world. 
This plays into some of the ideas 
that the House manager presented that 
somehow this was terrible; it sent a 
signal to the Russians. Part of the 
whole point, Ambassador Volker ex-
plained, was that there was concern 
that it not become public because it 
would then not send a signal. That is 
what happened until the POLITICO ar-
ticle came out on August 28. I think 
that is the best way to understand the 
difference and approach there. Thank 
you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. I send a question to the 
desk on behalf of myself and Senator 
BRAUN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Senator from Indiana and Senator 
BRAUN ask both parties the following 
question: 
We were promised by House managers that 
the evidence supporting each article of im-
peachment would be ‘‘overwhelming’’ and 
‘‘uncontested.’’ Virtually every day, House 
managers have insisted that the Senate can-
not have a trial without witnesses. Do both 
parties agree that the Senate has included in 
evidence in this trial the testimony of every 
single witness from which the House heard 
before they voted, except for the intelligence 
community IG report that Chairman SCHIFF 
kept secret? 
We begin with the House managers. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Let me take 
this opportunity, if I can, to answer a 
few questions. First, is the fact that 
the testimony of the witnesses before 
the House sufficient to relieve the Sen-
ate of an obligation to have a trial? 
And the answer is no. There is no rea-
son, and, indeed, every other Senate 
trial—impeachment trial in history— 
has involved witnesses who did not tes-
tify before the House. This will be the

first departure. It shouldn’t be if it is 
to be a fair trial. 
I want to quickly respond to a couple 
of other points. The question was 
asked: Why didn’t we charge bribery? 
And the answer is we could have 
charged bribery. In fact, we outlined 
the facts that constitute bribery in the 
article, but ‘‘abuse of power’’ is the 
highest crime. The Framers have it in 
mind as the highest crime. The facts 
we allege within that do constitute 
bribery, but had we charged bribery 
within the ‘‘abuse of power’’ article, I 
can assure you that counsel here would 
be arguing: You have charged two of-
fenses within the same article. That 
makes that invalid. We wouldn’t have 
had Alan Dershowitz making that ar-
gument because he says abuse of power 
is not impeachable. They would have 
had Jonathan Turley here making that 
argument. If we split them into two 
separate articles—one for abuse of 
power and one for bribery—they would 
have argued you have taken one crime 
and made it into two. 
The important constitutional point 
here is not that the acts within abuse 
of power constitute bribery—although 
they do. The important point is we 
charged a constitutional crime—the 
most serious crime. The Founders gave 
the President enormous powers, and 
their most important consideration 
was that the President not abuse that 
power, and they provided a remedy, 
and that remedy is impeachment. 
One final point. Mr. Sekulow said 
that is not how the Constitution 
works. The Constitution doesn’t allow 
the Chief Justice to make those deci-
sions, but, you know, he doesn’t say 
the Constitution prohibits. The Con-
stitution permits it if they will agree, 
but they won’t. And he said it is the 
same as in the House, and it is the 
same as in the House. And it is the 
same in this way: If they were oper-
ating in good faith, if they really want-
ed a fair resolution, if they weren’t just 
shooting for delay, they would allow 
the Chief Justice to make these deci-
sions. 
But what they do not want is they do 
not want you to hear John Bolton. And 
why? Because when you hear, graphi-
cally, a man saying the President of 
the United States told me to withhold 
aid from our ally, to coerce foreign as-
sistance in his election, when the 
American people hear that firsthand— 
not filtered through our statements— 
they will recognize impeachable con-
duct when they see it. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. Sekulow, you have 21⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
With regard to the last statement, I 
am just going to say: Asked and an-
swered. I have answered the question 
about the issue of moving forward if 
there were witnesses and our view on 
that. I don’t have to say anything else. 
Now, with regard to the question 
that was actually presented, 29 times— 
29 times—the House managers have 
used 
the 
phrase 
‘‘overwhelming, 
uncontested, 
sufficient.’’ 
‘‘Proved’’ 
they said 31 times. Now, that is just 
what the record says. 
It is true that the record from the 
House was accepted provisionally sub-
ject to evidentiary objections, but they 
are the ones who have said ‘‘over-
whelmingly’’ and ‘‘proved.’’ Now, we, of 
course, disagree with their conclusions 
as a matter of fact and as a matter of 
law. But for them to come up here and 
to argue ‘‘proved’’ and ‘‘overwhelm-
ingly’’ a total of, I guess, 64 times in a 
couple of days, tells me a lot about 
what they want. 
What we are asking for is this pro-
ceeding to continue, and with that, we 
are done. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The majority leader is recognized.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
AMBASSADOR FELIX ROHATYN 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to a man of vision and great in-
tellect, whose life and legacy were marked by 
extraordinary achievements and a profound 
love for America: Ambassador Felix Rohatyn. 
From ushering New York City through eco-
nomic crisis to proudly serving our nation as 
Ambassador to France to becoming a leading 
voice for building the infrastructure of America 
in a green way, Ambassador Rohatyn em-
bodied the American spirit and helped build a 
brighter future for all Americans. His passing 
last December is a great official loss for our 
nation and a profound personal loss for all 
those privileged to call him a friend, counselor 
and loved one. 
Felix Rohatyn was born in Vienna, Austria in 
1928 to a prominent Jewish family. By 1935, 
he and his parents were forced to flee their 
home to escape the rise of Nazism, embarking 
on a years-long journey that eventually 
brought them to safety in the United States in 
1942. His early experience as a refugee in-
stilled in him a love for our bedrock American 
values of freedom, justice and economic op-
portunity for all, an appreciation that he hon-
ored throughout his life. 
His professional success made him a 
sought-after economic expert and intellectual 
resource for countless public officials and 
leaders around the world. When New York 
City faced an unprecedented insolvency crisis 
in the 1970s, Felix Rohatyn’s collaborative 
leadership skills brought together political and 
financial interests to make the difficult deci-
sions needed to save the city. In the process, 
he made sure that the city invested in all its 
citizens, setting aside funding for schools, 
housing and public transportation to ensure a 
financially stable and prosperous future for 
millions of Americans. 
Felix Rohatyn brought that same successful 
leadership, in addition to his fluency in French, 
to representing the United States as Ambas-
sador to France. During his ambassadorship, 
he worked to strengthen the economic and 
cultural bonds between our nations, reaffirm-
ing an unbreakable friendship and partnership 
that dates back to the founding of our country. 
It was always a privilege to have Ambas-
sador Rohatyn meet with Members of Con-
gress to discuss the most pressing issues fac-
ing our economy and our nation. His pas-
sionate advocacy for robust, climate change— 
resilient infrastructure made him a thoughtful 
advisor and effective Co-Chair of the bipar-
tisan Commission on Public Infrastructure, 
helping Congress establish a framework to re-
build our nation and boost our economy in a 
sustainable, job-creating way. 
After Superstorm Sandy in 2012, his for-
ward-looking vision was essential to his serv-
ice as Co-Chair of the New York State 2100 
Commission. The innovative strategies he 
helped develop have been critical in rebuilding 
devastated communities and will ensure the 
city is better prepared to meet the challenges 
posed by the worsening climate crisis. 
America was blessed by the life and leader-
ship of Ambassador Felix Rohatyn. May it be 
a comfort to his children, Pierre, Nicolas and 
Michael, his many grandchildren and the en-
tire Rohatyn family that so many mourn their 
loss and pray for them at this sad time.

TRIBUTE TO FOSTENIA W. BAKER 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the life and legacy of 
a tenacious and proud South Carolinian, who 
worked tirelessly her entire life to ensure her 
family’s story was not forgotten. Earlier this 
month, we lost Dr. Fostenia W. Baker, a life-
long educator, family historian, and deter-
mined advocate. She will be sorely missed. 
Fostenia Baker was a native of Florence, 
South Carolina, and she graduated from South 
Carolina State College (now University), which 
is also my alma mater. During her time as a 
student, I got to know Fostenia as my future 
wife Emily’s roommate. There was always 
something different about Fostenia, but I didn’t 
understand until much later the family history 
that made her demeanor stand out. 
Fostenia, like many of our classmates, left 
South Carolina after graduation and earned a 
master’s degree from City College of New 
York and a doctorate from George Wash-
ington University. She began her teaching ca-
reer in the New York City Public Schools in 
1970. Five years later, she returned to South 
Carolina to teach health education at Voor-
hees College and later served as a research 
fellow in the School of Epidemiology at the 
University of South Carolina. She remained in 
South Carolina, teaching education at Allen 
University and serving as a science instructor 
in Colleton County Schools in Walterboro, 
South Carolina. 
In 1984, Dr. Baker was appointed instructor 
of education for the District of Columbia De-
partment of Corrections in Washington, D.C. 
She went on to become an assistant professor 
of health education at Trinity College and later 
Howard University, both in Washington, D.C. 
Her final position from 1997 to 2005 was as 
instructor of science and health education in 
the Prince Georges County Public Schools in 
Hyattsville, Maryland. 
Dr. Baker won numerous teaching awards 
including an Excellence Award as Health Edu-
cation Chairperson for Prince Georges County 
Public Schools and the Innovative Professor 
Award at Howard University. She also pub-
lished numerous articles in scientific journals 
and a book entitled Women’s Health, What Do 
You Know About It. 
In addition to her professional work, it was 
a personal family history that was her true 
passion. In 1897, her great uncle, Frazier B. 
Baker, was named the first Black Postmaster 
in Lake City, South Carolina. Immediately, he 
was threatened by the white community who 
didn’t want him to serve in this important role. 
Postmaster Baker would not be deterred by 
their intimidation, and he performed his job 
with distinction despite constant torment. On 
February 22, 1898, the harassers make good 
on their promise to remove him from his post 
by firing upon the Baker family in their home. 
Frazier Baker and his infant daughter were 
killed in the attack, and the other five family 
members barely escaped. 
Dr. Baker was determined to ensure that 
her great uncle’s lynching would not be forgot-
ten. She spent her life pursuing recognition for 
Postmaster Baker—writing a book of his life 
story and appearing in the documentary An 
Outrage that told the story of lynching in the 
American South. 
She also contacted me to ask if Congress 
would name the Lake City Post Office in Post-
master Baker’s honor. I decided to champion 
the effort and introduced legislation in 2018, 
that was co-sponsored by all members of the 
South Carolina delegation. It became law later 
that year. 
On February 22, 2019, the 121st anniver-
sary of Frazier Baker’s murder, Fostenia 
Baker joined me in Lake City as we officially 
dedicated the Postmaster Frazier B. Baker 
Post Office. It was one of the proudest days 
in her life, and I was pleased to be there to 
share it with her. 
Without 
her 
determination, 
Postmaster 
Baker’s story may have continued to be lost to 
history. However, Fostenia’s tremendous work 
has ensured that his story will endure. Her 
‘‘bulldog tenacity’’ is a tribute to how one per-
son can truly make a difference. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my col-
leagues join me in celebrating the life of Dr. 
Fostenia Baker. She is an inspiring example of 
a life well lived. Her legacy lives on in the stu-
dents she taught and the lessons she has left 
for future generations by sharing her family’s 
history.

Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Buster 
Davis, who passed away on Thursday, Janu-

Buster was born on October 25, 1926, in 
Tishomingo County, Mississippi. He was a

Belmont, Mississippi, where he led the team to 
win two State Championships. After High 
School, Buster obtained a Bachelor of Science

from Mississippi State University, then re-
ceived his Masters from the University of Mis-
sissippi before answering the call to serve our 
great nation in the United States Army during 
WWII. 
On August 22, 1948, Buster married Billie 
Faye South, and they remained together for 
over 63 years. Buster’s love for basketball 
brought him back to Belmont High School 
where he became a basketball coach. He also 
coached at both Kossuth High School in Cor-
inth, Mississippi and Thrasher High School in 
Booneville, Mississippi. In 1962, Buster began 
coaching at Itawamba Junior College in Ful-
ton, Mississippi, and led the team to multiple 
State Finals. He left his coaching career in 
1975 and started his career with Davis Ford. 
He stayed with Ford for over 55 years. 
Left to cherish his memory are his daugh-
ters: Pam Davis Horton of Birmingham, Ala-
bama, and Patti Davis Bennett of Fulton, Mis-
sissippi; his grandchildren, great-grand chil-
dren, as well as many friends and extended 
family members. 
Buster’s life was one of service, grace, love 
for his family, and community. He will be 
greatly missed by all who he encountered.

TRIBUTE TO THE SPITZER SPACE 
TELESCOPE 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) mission managed by 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the 
Spitzer Space Telescope. After 16 years of 
discovering hidden truths of our Universe, 
Spitzer will be retired on January 30, 2020. 
Designed to study the cold, old and dusty, 
Spitzer was launched in August of 2003 and 
used its sensitive sensors to study infrared 
light emitted by celestial bodies and cosmic 
objects from our own solar system to the fur-
thest reaches of the Universe. Spitzer returned 
data on space phenomena from asteroids to 
the most distant galaxies ever detected whose 
light was emitted 13.4 billion years ago when 
the universe was less than 5 percent of its 
current age. It discovered the largest ring 
around Saturn made of dust particles, identi-
fied the first Buckyballs in space, found distant 
blackholes and mapped out our Milky Way 
with unprecedented clarity. Spitzer gave us a 
view beyond the gas and dust clouds to study 
the youngest stars and the ingredients to cre-
ate planets, comets and other components of 
our solar system. 
As with many NASA missions, the telescope 
operated much longer than expected and has 
a long list of accomplishments beyond the 
mission’s original science goals. Undoubtedly, 
one of Spitzer’s greatest discoveries was 
seven Earth-size planets in around the star 
TRAPPIST–1. Spitzer enabled scientists to 
study exoplanets and identify atmospheric 
molecules, temperature variations, and wind 
speed. 
As Spitzer is safely retired in deep space 
orbit far from Earth, the legacy of the mission 
will be continued by the James Webb Space 
Telescope, which will also conduct infrared as-
tronomy based on Spitzer’s pioneering and 
trailblazing work in infrared light. The massive 
amount of data collected by Spitzer has been 
used in over 8,700 scientific publications and 
its data will continue to be available to the sci-
entific community around the world for future 
research. 
I have great appreciation and pride for the 
countless personnel that have worked to en-
sure that Spitzer operated with precision, from 
design to data analysis, that allowed Spitzer to 
study the Universe with infrared light. The nu-
merous discoveries made move us closer to 
shedding light on the profound mysteries of 
our Universe. I ask all members to join me in 
honoring the achievements of the Spitzer 
Space Telescope and the hard-working indi-
viduals and organizations that made Spitzer’s 
mission so successful.

CONGRATULATING 
DR. 
JEAN 
G. 
CHAMPOMMIER ON HIS RETIRE-
MENT 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Jean 
G. Champommier on his retirement from a dis-
tinguished career in community organizing and 
social work. He has dedicated his life to cre-
ating programs that improve the lives of those 
in underserved communities throughout Los 
Angeles County. 
Dr. Champommier began his career in so-
cial work during the 1960s when he took on a 
field-work placement at the Kennedy Child 
Study Center in Santa Monica. Through this 
position, he worked with children with develop-
mental disabilities and their families, solidifying 
his passion for helping his neighbors and his 
community. 
Since 1983, Dr. Champommier has served 
as the Executive Director, and later President/ 
CEO, of Alma Family Services. This agency 
provides communities throughout Los Angeles 
County with multilingual and multicultural serv-
ices, including helping families and individuals 
cope with substance abuse, emotional difficul-
ties, and developmental challenges. Through 
his role at Alma, he expanded the agency’s 
first contract with the Los Angeles County De-
partment of Mental Health and oversaw 
Alma’s growth as a provider of community-in-
tegrated social programs. During his tenure, 
Alma has added social rehabilitation programs 
for child abuse, gang prevention and reduction 
programs, and has grown to 16 sites through-
out Los Angeles County. In 2015, Dr. 
Champommier was appointed by County Su-
pervisor Hilda Solis to Los Angeles’ Public 
Health Commission. Eventually serving as 
chair of the Commission, he supervised the 
Public Health Department’s programs and 
made recommendations to the Board of Su-
pervisors to ensure that community input was 
heard in matters of public health. 
Dr. Champommier’s impact stretches out-
side his field work and into the classroom. He 
has taught courses in child welfare and com-
munity organization at UC Santa Barbara, Cal 
State Northridge, and Cal State L.A., and has 
also been an instructor in social work for USC 
and UCLA. Additionally, he has coordinated 
conferences on youth empowerment and farm 
labor for UC Santa Barbara Extension. 
Dr. Champommier’s career demonstrates 
his admirable dedication and service to his 
community. I thank him for his 40 years of 
contributions to Los Angeles and wish him 
nothing but the best in retirement.

IN HONOR OF JOHN ROBERT 
MILLER 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the service of World War II veteran 
John Robert Miller of Barren County, Ken-
tucky. 
After growing up in Freedom, Kentucky, 
John Robert volunteered for the Army when 
he was just eighteen years old in June 1941. 
He served in the Pacific theater until World 
War II concluded in 1945. During his Army 
service, John Robert rose to the rank of tech-
nical sergeant in an artillery unit, and he wit-
nessed General Douglas MacArthur stepping 
off the landing craft to make his triumphant re-
turn to the Philippines. 
Following his service in the Army, John 
Robert became a fixture in the Barren County 
community. He married his wife Christine in 
1945, and they were married for 67 years until 
her death in 2013. John Robert was a farmer 
with hogs, corn, and tobacco, and he also 
worked as a crop insurance adjuster. John 
Robert served as a Magistrate on the Barren 
County Fiscal Court for three years, and he 
has served as an Election Commissioner 
since 1993. In 2016, John Robert was award-
ed the Patriot Award by Barren County Vet-
eran’s Association, and he was inducted into 
the Alumni Hall of Honor for Barren County 
Schools. 
I thank John Robert for his service to our 
country and to our community.

ILLINOIS 
VOLLEY-
BALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Lexi Rodriguez, a junior from 
Sterling High School, who was named the 
2019–2020 Gatorade Illinois Volleyball Player 
of the Year. 
Lexi led the Golden Warriors to a 36–6 
record and a second win at Class 3A State 
Championships this year. Showing her dedica-
tion to sports, she also took part of this sea-
son to help Team USA win a gold medal at 
the FIVB Girls U18 World Championships in 
Egypt. In addition, she is a three-year class

NEVER AGAIN EDUCATION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
speak in favor of H.R. 943, the Never Again 
Education Act. 
Monday, we recognized International Holo-
caust Remembrance Day, which marks 75 
years since the liberation of the Auschwitz 
death camp. The Holocaust is a crime without 
parallel. And how we deal with its memory de-
fines us as a people and as a country. 
As we look back at one of the darkest chap-
ters in history, it is also our duty to look for-
ward. 
Antisemitism is on the rise and hatred and 
intolerance seem to spread unchecked. This 
cannot stand. As we honor the memory of 
those who came before us, we must recommit 
ourselves to securing a bright future for the 
next generation. 
To ensure this, we must continue to educate 
younger generations on the atrocities of the 
Holocaust and how it could occur. That is why 
I strongly support H.R. 943. It is critical that 
the Department of Education provide the funds 
needed for schools to implement Holocaust 
education programs into their curriculum, so 
students understand the history of the Holo-
caust. I urge the Senate to pass this bill imme-
diately.

HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
on behalf of the House Armed Services Com-
mittee, I rise to honor and express gratitude to 
Mr. John Johnson for his illustrious career 
serving his country upon his retirement. 
Known as JJ to his friends and family, his long 
career is marked with distinction and praise 
from his colleagues who consider him an ex-
emplary patriot and an embodiment of what it 
means to dedicate one’s life to service. 
Born in Georgetown, South Carolina, Mr. 
Johnson’s service to our country started in 
1969 when he joined the U.S. Air Force. He 
served in the prestigious Air Force Honor 
Guard and, later, in the Air Force Legislative 
Liaison Office at the Pentagon, rising to the 
rank of Senior Master Sergeant. After 20 
years of service, Mr. Johnson retired from the 
Air Force but chose to stay in Washington to 
join the Capitol Hill Police Department, where 
he served for another 20 years. During his 
four decades of service, he supported over 
100 
Congressional 
Delegation 
trips 
and 
served in every Presidential Inauguration since 
President Nixon. 
In 2009, Mr. Johnson retired from the Cap-
itol Police but again chose to serve the public 
by joining the House Armed Services Com-
mittee. Over the past decade, he has sup-
ported the Committee with all hearings, meet-
ings, and events. He has been an instrumental 
part of the committee’s staff and although he 
kept a low profile, his impact is deeply felt and 
is a testament to his invaluable work and con-
tribution. His presence will be sorely missed 
by his many colleagues who consider him a 
close friend, mentor, and inspiration. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure 
that I recognize and thank John Johnson for 
his many years of service to this country and 
the House Armed Services Committee. I wish 
him a happy retirement, to be enjoyed with his 
friends and family.

Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD the Government Accountability

that the Trump Administration’s Office of Man-
agement and Budget violated the Impound-

GAO DECISION 
Matter of: Office of Management and Budg-
et—Withholding of Ukraine Security As-
sistance. 
File: B–331564. 
Date: January 16, 2020. 
DIGEST 
In the summer of 2019, the Office of Man-
agement and Budget (OMB) withheld from 
obligation funds appropriated to the Depart-
ment of Defense (DOD) for security assist-
ance to Ukraine. In order to withhold the 
funds, OMB issued a series of nine apportion-
ment schedules with footnotes that made all 
unobligated balances unavailable for obliga-
tion. Faithful execution of the law does not 
permit the President to substitute his own 
policy priorities for those that Congress has 
enacted into law. OMB withheld funds for a 
policy reason, which is not permitted under 
the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The 
withholding was not a programmatic delay. 
Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated 
the ICA. 
DECISION 
In the summer of 2019, OMB withheld from 
obligation approximately $214 million appro-
priated to DOD for security assistance to 
Ukraine. See Department of Defense Appro-
priations Act, 2019, Pub. L. No. 115–245, div. 
A, title IX, § 9013, 132 Stat. 2981, 3044–45 (Sept. 
28, 2018). OMB withheld amounts by issuing a 
series of nine apportionment schedules with 
footnotes that made all unobligated balances 
for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initia-
tive (USAI) unavailable for obligation. See 
Letter from General Counsel, OMB, to Gen-
eral Counsel, GAO (Dec. 11, 2019) (OMB Re-
sponse), at 1–2. Pursuant to our role under 
the ICA, we are issuing this decision. Con-
gressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93–344, title X, § 1015, 
88 Stat. 297, 336 (July 12, 1974), codified at 2 
U.S.C. § 686. As explained below, we conclude 
that OMB withheld the funds from obligation 
for an unauthorized reason in violation of 
the ICA. See 2 U.S.C. § 684. We also question 
actions regarding funds appropriated to the 
Department of State (State) for security as-
sistance to Ukraine. 
OMB removed the footnote from the appor-
tionment for the USAI funds on September 
12, 2019. OMB Response, at 2. Prior to their 
expiration, Congress then rescinded and re-
appropriated the funds . Continuing Appro-
priations Act, 2020, Pub. L. No. 116–59, div. A, 
§ 124(b), 133 Stat. 1093, 1098 (Sept. 27, 2019). 
In accordance with our regular practice, 
we contacted OMB, the Executive Office of 
the President, and DOD to seek factual infor-
mation and their legal views on this matter.

the White House did not plan to send a sepa-
rate response. Letter from Senior Associate 
Counsel to the President, Executive Office of 
the President, to General Counsel, GAO (Dec. 
20, 2019). We have contacted DOD regarding 
its response several times. Letter from Gen-
eral Counsel, GAO, to Secretary of Defense

eral Counsel for Legislation, DOD (Dec. 12,

General Counsel Official, DOD (Dec. 19, 2019). 
Thus far, DOD officials have not provided a 
response or a timeline for when we will re-
ceive one. 
BACKGROUND 
For fiscal year 2019, Congress appropriated 
$250 million for the Ukraine Security Assist-
ance Initiative (USAI). Pub. L. No. 115–245, 
§ 9013, 132 Stat. at 3044–45. The funds were 
available ‘‘to provide assistance, including 
training; equipment; lethal assistance; logis-
tics 
support, 
supplies 
and 
services; 
sustainment; and intelligence support to the 
military and national security forces of 
Ukraine.’’ Id. § 9013, 132 Stat. at 3044. The ap-
propriation made the funds available for ob-
ligation through September 30, 2019. Id. 
DOD was required to notify Congress 15 
days in advance of any obligation of the 
USAI funds. Id. § 9013, 132 Stat. at 3045. In 
order to obligate more than fifty percent of 
the amount appropriated, DOD was also re-
quired to certify to Congress that Ukraine 
had taken ‘‘substantial actions’’ on ‘‘defense 
institutional reforms.’’ John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2019, Pub. L. No. 115–232, div., A, title 
XII, 1246, 132 Stat. 1636, 2049 (Aug. 13, 2018) 
(amending National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2016, Pub. L. No. 114–92, 
div. A, title XII, § 1250, 129 Stat. 726, 1068 
(Nov. 25, 2015)). On May 23, 2019, DOD pro-
vided this certification to Congress. Letter 
from Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, 
to Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations (May 23, 2019) (DOD Certification) 
(noting that similar copies had been provided 
to the congressional defense committees and 
the House Committee on Foreign Affairs). In 
its certification, DOD included descriptions 
of its planned expenditures, totaling $125 
million. Id. 
On July 25, 2019, OMB issued the first of 
nine apportionment schedules with footnotes 
withholding USAI funds from obligation. 
OMB Response, 1–2. This footnote read: 
‘‘Amounts apportioned, but not yet obli-
gated as of the date of this reapportionment, 
for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initia-
tive (Initiative) are not available for obliga-
tion until August 5, 2019, to allow for an 
interagency process to determine the best 
use of such funds. Based on OMB’s commu-
nication with DOD on July 25, 2019, OMB un-
derstands from the Department that this 
brief pause in obligations will not preclude 
DOD’s timely execution of the final policy 
direction. DOD may continue its planning 
and casework for the Initiative during this 
period.’’ Id.; see id., Attachment. 
On both August 6 and 15, 2019, OMB ap-
proved additional apportionment actions to 
extend this ‘‘pause in obligations,’’ with 
footnotes that, except for the dates, were 
identical to the July 25, 2019 apportionment 
action. Id., at 2 n. 2. OMB approved addi-
tional apportionment actions on August 20, 
27, and 31, 2019; and on September 5, 6, and 10, 
2019. Id. The footnotes from these additional 
apportionment actions were, except for the 
dates, otherwise identical to one another. 
Id., Attachment. They nevertheless differed 
from those of July 25 and August 6 and 15, 
2019, in that they omitted the second sen-
tence that appeared in the earlier apportion-
ment actions regarding OMB’s understanding 
that the pause in obligation would not pre-
clude timely obligation. Id. The apportion-
ment schedule issued on August 20 read as 
follows: 
‘‘Amounts apportioned, but not yet obli-
gated as to the date of this reapportionment, 
for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initia-
tive (Initiative) are not available for obliga-
tion until August 26, 2019, to allow for an 
interagency process to determine the best 
use of such funds. DOD may continue its 
planning and casework for the Initiative dur-
ing this period.’’ Id., Attachment. The appor-
tionment schedules issued on August 27 and 
31, 2019; and on September 5, 6, and 10, 2019 
were identical except for the dates. Id. On 
September 12, 2019, OMB issued an apportion-
ment that removed the footnote that pre-
viously made the USAI funds unavailable for 
obligation. OMB Response, at 2; id., Attach-
ment. According to OMB, approximately $214 
million of the USAI appropriation was with-
held as a result of these footnotes. OMB Re-
sponse, at 2. OMB did not transmit a special 
message proposing to defer or rescind the 
funds. 
DISCUSSION 
At issue in this decision is whether OMB 
had authority to withhold the USAI funds 
from obligation. The Constitution specifi-
cally vests Congress with the power of the 
purse, providing that ‘‘No Money shall be 
drawn from the Treasury, but in Con-
sequence of Appropriations made by Law.’’ 
U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7. The Constitution 
also vests all legislative powers in Congress 
and sets forth the procedures of bicamer-
alism and presentment, through which the 
President may accept or veto a bill passed by 
both Houses of Congress, and Congress may 
subsequently override a presidential veto. 
Id., art. I, § 7, cl. 2, 3. The President is not 
vested with the power to ignore or amend 
any such duly enacted law. See Clinton v. 
City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998) (the 
Constitution does not authorize the Presi-
dent ‘‘to enact, to amend, or to repeal stat-
utes’’). Instead, he must ‘‘faithfully execute’’ 
the law as Congress enacts it. U.S. Const., 
art. II, § 3. 
An appropriations act is a law like any 
other; therefore, unless Congress has enacted 
a law providing otherwise, the President 
must take care to ensure that appropriations 
are prudently obligated during their period 
of availability. See B–329092, Dec. 12, 2017 
(the ICA operates on the premise that the 
President is required to obligate funds appro-
priated by Congress, unless otherwise au-
thorized to withhold). In fact, Congress was 
concerned about the failure to prudently ob-
ligate according to its Congressional prerog-
atives when it enacted and later amended 
the ICA. See generally, H.R. Rep. No. 100–313, 
at 66–67 (1987); see also S. Rep. No. 93–688, at 
75 (1974) (explaining that the objective was to 
assure that ‘‘the practice of reserving funds 
does not become a vehicle for furthering Ad-
ministration policies and priorities at the 
expense of those decided by Congress’’). 
The Constitution grants the President no 
unilateral authority to withhold funds from 
obligation. See B–135564, July 26, 1973. In-
stead, Congress has vested the President 
with strictly circumscribed authority to im-
pound, or withhold, budget authority only in 
limited circumstances as expressly provided 
in the ICA. See 2 U.S.C. §§ 681–688. The ICA 
separates impoundments into two exclusive 
categories—deferrals and rescissions. The 
President may temporarily withhold funds 
from obligation—but not beyond the end of 
the fiscal year in which the President trans-
mits the special message—by proposing a 
‘‘deferral.’’ 2 U.S.C. § 684. The President may 
also seek the permanent cancellation of 
funds for fiscal policy or other reasons, in-
cluding the termination of programs for 
which Congress has provided budget author-
ity, by proposing a ‘‘rescission.’’ 2 U.S.C. 
§ 683. 
In either case, the ICA requires that the 
President transmit a special message to Con-
gress that includes the amount of budget au-
thority proposed for deferral or rescission 
and the reason for the proposal. 2 U.S.C. 
§§ 683–684. These special messages must pro-
vide detailed and specific reasoning to jus-
tify the withholding, as set out in the ICA. 
See 2 U.S.C. §§ 683–684; B–237297.4, Feb. 20, 1990 
(vague or general assertions are insufficient 
to justify the withholding of budget author-
ity). The burden to justify a withholding of 
budget authority rests with the executive 
branch. 
There is no assertion or other indication 
here that OMB intended to propose a rescis-
sion. Not only did OMB not submit a special 
message with such a proposal, the footnotes 
in the apportionment schedules, by their 
very terms, established dates for the release 
of amounts withheld. The only other author-
ity, then, for withholding amounts would 
have been a deferral. 
The ICA authorizes the deferral of budget 
authority 
in 
a 
limited 
range 
of 
cir-
cumstances: to provide for contingencies; to 
achieve savings made possible by or through 
changes in requirements or greater effi-
ciency of operations; or as specifically pro-
vided by law. 2 U.S.C. § 684(b). No officer or 
employee of the United States may defer 
budget authority for any other purpose. Id. 
Here, OMB did not identify—in either the 
apportionment schedules themselves or in its 
response to us—any contingencies as recog-
nized by the ICA, savings or efficiencies that 
would result from a withholding, or any law 
specifically authorizing the withholding. In-
stead, the footnote in the apportionment 
schedules described the withholding as nec-
essary ‘‘to determine the best use of such 
funds.’’ See OMB Response, at 2; Attach-
ment. In its response to us, OMB described 
the withholding as necessary to ensure that 
the funds were not spent ‘‘in a manner that 
could conflict with the President’s foreign 
policy.’’ OMB Response, at 9. 
The ICA does not permit deferrals for pol-
icy reasons. See B–237297.3, Mar. 6, 1990; B– 
224882, Apr. 1, 1987. OMB’s justification for 
the withholding falls squarely within the 
scope of an impermissible policy deferral. 
Thus, the deferral of USAI funds was im-
proper under the ICA. 
When Congress enacts appropriations, it 
has provided budget authority that agencies 
must obligate in a manner consistent with 
law. The Constitution vests lawmaking 
power with the Congress. U.S. Const., art. I, 
§ 8, cl. 18. The President and officers in an 
Administration of course may consider their 
own policy objectives as they craft policy 
proposals for inclusion in the President’s 
budget submission. 
See B–319488, May 21, 2010, at 5 (‘‘Planning 
activities are an essential element of the 
budget process.’’). However, once enacted, 
the President must ‘‘take care that the laws 
be faithfully executed.’’ See U.S. Const., art. 
II, § 3. Enacted statutes, and not the Presi-
dent’s policy priorities, necessarily provide 
the animating framework for all actions 
agencies take to carry out government pro-
grams. Louisiana Public Service Commission v. 
FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (‘‘[A]n agency lit-
erally has no power to act . . . unless and 
until Congress confers power upon it.’’); 
Michigan v. EPA, 268 F.3d 1075, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 
2001) (a federal agency is ‘‘a creature of stat-
ute’’ and ‘‘has no constitutional or common 
law existence or authority, but only those 
authorities conferred upon it by Congress’’).

January 29, 2020 
Faithful execution of the law does not per-
mit the President to substitute his own pol-
icy priorities for those that Congress has en-
acted into law. In fact, Congress was con-
cerned 
about 
exactly 
these 
types 
of 
withholdings when it enacted and later 
amended the ICA. See H.R. Rep. No. 100–313, 
at 66–67 (1987); see also S. Rep. No. 93–688, at 
75 (1974) (explaining that the objective was to 
assure that ‘‘the practice of reserving funds 
does not become a vehicle for furthering Ad-
ministration policies and priorities at the 
expense of those decided by Congress’’). 
OMB asserts that its actions are not sub-
ject to the ICA because they constitute a 
programmatic delay. OMB Response, at 7, 9. 
It argues that a ‘‘policy development process 
is a fundamental part of program implemen-
tation,’’ so its impoundment of funds for the 
sake of a policy process is programmatic. Id., 
at 7. OMB further argues that because re-
views for compliance with statutory condi-
tions and congressional mandates are consid-
ered programmatic, so too should be reviews 
undertaken to ensure compliance with presi-
dential policy prerogatives. Id., at 9. OMB’s 
assertions have no basis in law. We recognize 
that, even where the President does not 
transmit a special message pursuant to the 
procedures established by the ICA, it is pos-
sible that a delay in obligation may not con-
stitute a reportable impoundment. See B– 
329092, Dec. 12, 2017; B–222215, Mar. 28, 1986. 
However, programmatic delays occur when 
an agency is taking necessary steps to imple-
ment a program, but because of factors ex-
ternal to the program, funds temporarily go 
unobligated. B–329739, Dec. 19, 2018; B–291241, 
Oct. 8, 2002; B–241514.5, May 7, 1991. This pre-
sumes, of course, that the agency is making 
reasonable efforts to obligate. B–241514.5, 
May 7, 1991. Here, there was no external fac-
tor causing an unavoidable delay. Rather, 
OMB on its own volition explicitly barred 
DOD from obligating amounts. 
Furthermore, at the time OMB issued the 
first apportionment footnote withholding 
the USAI funds, DOD had already produced a 
plan for expending the funds. See DOD Cer-
tification, at 4–14. DOD had decided on the 
items it planned to purchase and had pro-
vided this information to Congress on May 
23, 2019. Id. Program execution was therefore 
well underway when OMB issued the appor-
tionment footnotes. As a result, we cannot 
accept OMB’s assertion that its actions are 
programmatic. 
The burden to justify a withholding of 
budget authority rests with the executive 
branch. Here, OMB has failed to meet this 
burden. We conclude that OMB violated the 
ICA when it withheld USAI funds for a policy 
reason. 
FOREIGN MILITARY FINANCING 
We also question actions regarding funds 
appropriated to State for security assistance 
to Ukraine. In a series of apportionments in 
August of 2019, OMB withheld from obliga-
tion some foreign military financing (FMF) 
funds for a period of six days. These actions 
may have delayed the obligation of $26.5 mil-
lion in FMF funds. See OMB Response, at 3. 
An additional $141.5 million in FMF funds 
may have been withheld while a congres-
sional notification was considered by OMB. 
See E-mail from GAO Liaison Director, 
State, to Staff Attorney, GAO, Subject: Re-
sponse to GAO on Timeliness of Ukraine Mili-
tary Assistance (Jan. 10, 2020) (State’s Addi-
tional Response). We have asked both State 
and OMB about the availability of these 
funds during the relevant period. Letter from

State (Nov. 25, 2019). State provided us with 
limited information. E-mail from Staff At-
torney, GAO, to Office of General Counsel, 
State, Subject: RE: Response to GAO on Timeli-
ness of Ukraine Military Assistance (Dec. 18, 
2019) (GAO’s request for additional informa-
tion); E-mail from GAO Liaison Director, 
State, to Assistant General Counsel for Ap-
propriations Law, GAO, Subject: Response to 
GAO on Timeliness of Ukraine Military Assist-
ance (Dec. 12, 2019) (State’s response to 
GAO’s November 25, 2019 letter); State’s Ad-
ditional Response. OMB’s response to us con-
tained very little information regarding the 
FMF funds. See generally OMB Response, at 
2–3. 
As a result, we will renew our request for 
specific information from State and OMB re-
garding the potential impoundment of FMF 
funds in order to determine whether the Ad-
ministration’s actions amount to a with-
holding subject to the ICA, and if so, wheth-
er that withholding was proper. We will con-
tinue to pursue this matter. 
CONCLUSION 
OMB violated the ICA when it withheld 
DOD’s USAI funds from obligation for policy 
reasons. This impoundment of budget au-
thority was not a programmatic delay. 
OMB and State have failed, as of yet, to 
provide the information we need to fulfill 
our duties under the ICA regarding potential 
impoundments of FMF funds. We will con-
tinue to pursue this matter and will provide 
our decision to the Congress after we have 
received the necessary information. 
We consider a reluctance to provide a ful-
some response to have constitutional signifi-
cance. GAO’s role under the ICA—to provide 
information and legal analysis to Congress 
as it performs oversight of executive activ-
ity—is essential to ensuring respect for and 
allegiance to Congress’ constitutional power 
of the purse. All federal officials and employ-
ees take an oath to uphold and protect the 
Constitution and its core tenets, including 
the congressional power of the purse. We 
trust that State and OMB will provide the 
information needed.

Act does, under limited circumstances, allow 
the President to withhold money for up to 45 
congressional session days, the President 
cannot freeze the money for so long that it 
can no longer be used. I am submitting this in

trol Act. 
GAO, U.S. GOVERNMENT 
ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE, 
December 10, 2018. 
Subject: Impoundment Control Act—With-
holding of Funds through Their Date of 
Expiration 
Hon. STEVE WOMACK, 
Chairman, Committee on the Budget, 
House of Representatives. 
Hon. JOHN YARMUTH, 
Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, 
House of Representatives. 
This responds to your request for our legal 
opinion regarding the scope of the authority 
provided under the Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974 (ICA) to withhold budget author-
ity from obligation pending congressional 
consideration of a rescission proposal. Pub. 
L. No. 93–344, title X, 88 Stat. 297, 332 (July 
12, 1974), amended by Pub. L. No. 100–119, title 
II, §§ 206, 207, 101 Stat. 754, 785 (Sept. 29, 1987), 
classified at 2 U.S.C. §§ 681–688; Letter from 
Representative Steve Womack, Chairman, 
and Representative John Yarmuth, Ranking 
Member, House Committee on the Budget, to 
Comptroller General (Oct. 31, 2018). Under 
limited circumstances, the ICA allows the 
President to withhold amounts from obliga-
tion for up to 45 calendar days of continuous 
congressional session. See ICA, § 1012(b); 2 
U.S.C. § 683(b). At issue here is whether the 
Act allows such a withholding of a fixed-pe-
riod appropriation scheduled to expire with-
in the prescribed 45-day period to continue 
through the date on which the funds would 
expire. 
As discussed below, we conclude that the 
ICA does not permit the withholding of funds 
through their date of expiration. The statu-
tory text and legislative history of the ICA, 
Supreme Court case law, and the overarching 
constitutional framework of the legislative 
and executive powers provide no basis to in-
terpret the ICA as a mechanism by which the 
President may unilaterally abridge the en-
acted period of availability of a fixed-period 
appropriation. The Constitution vests in 
Congress the power of the purse, and Con-
gress did not cede this important power 
through the ICA. Instead, the terms of the 
ICA are strictly limited. The ICA permits 
only the temporary withholding of budget 
authority and provides that unless Congress 
rescinds the amounts at issue, they must be 
made available for obligation. The President 
cannot rely on the authority in the ICA to 
withhold amounts from obligation, while si-
multaneously disregarding the ICA’s limita-
tions. In accordance with our regular prac-
tice, we contacted the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for its legal views on this 
matter. GAO, Procedures and Practices for 
Legal Decisions and Opinions, GAO–06–1064SP 
(Washington, D.C.: Sept. 2006), available at 
www.gao.gov/products/GAO-06-1064SP; Letter 
from General Counsel, GAO, to General 
Counsel, OMB (Nov. 1, 2018). In response, 
OMB provided its legal analysis. Letter from 
General Counsel, OMB, to General Counsel, 
GAO (Nov. 16, 2018) (Response Letter). 
BACKGROUND 
The Constitution specifically vests Con-
gress with the power of the purse, providing 
that ‘‘No Money shall be drawn from the 
Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropria-
tions made by Law.’’ U.S. Const., art. I, § 9, 
cl. 7. The Constitution also vests all legisla-
tive powers in Congress and sets forth the 
procedures of bicameralism and present-
ment, through which the President may ac-
cept or veto a bill passed by both houses of 
Congress and Congress may subsequently 
override a presidential veto. Id., art. I, § 7, cl. 
2, 3. The procedures of bicameralism and pre-
sentment form the only mechanism for en-
acting federal law. See INS v. Chadha, 462 
U.S. 919, 951 (1983) (‘‘[T]he prescription for 
legislative action in Art. I, §§ 1, 7, represents 
the Framers’ decision that the legislative 
power of the Federal Government be exer-
cised in accord with a single, finely wrought 
and exhaustively considered, procedure.’’). 
The Constitution also vests Congress with 
power to make all laws ‘‘necessary and prop-
er’’ to implement its constitutional authori-
ties. 
U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 18. To that end, 
Congress has enacted several permanent 
statutes that govern the use of appropria-
tions, including the Antideficiency Act, 
which provides that agencies may incur obli-
gations or make expenditures only when suf-
ficient amounts are available in an appro-
priation. 
31 U.S.C. § 1341. Because agencies may 
incur obligations only in accordance with ap-
propriations made by law, and because the 
Constitution vests all lawmaking power in 
Congress, only appropriations duly enacted 
through the constitutional processes of bi-
cameralism and presentment authorize agen-
cies to incur obligations or make expendi-
tures. The Presentment Clauses allow the 
President to veto an appropriations bill be-
fore it becomes law. See Art. I, § 7, cl. 2, 3. 
However, the Constitution provides no mech-
anism for the President to invalidate a duly 
enacted law. Instead, the Constitution re-
quires the President to ‘‘take Care that the 
Laws be faithfully executed.’’ U.S. Const., 
art. II, § 3; see also Clinton v. City of New York, 
524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998) (the Constitution does 
not authorize the President ‘‘to enact, to 
amend, or to repeal statutes’’). 
An appropriation is a law like any other; 
therefore, unless Congress has enacted a law 
providing otherwise, the President must 
take care to ensure that appropriations are 
prudently obligated during their period of 
availability. See B–329092, Dec. 12, 2017 (not-
ing that the ICA operates on the premise 
that the President is required to obligate 
funds appropriated by Congress, unless oth-
erwise authorized to withhold). An ‘‘im-
poundment’’ is any action or inaction by an 
officer or employee of the federal govern-
ment that precludes obligation or expendi-
ture of budget authority. GAO, A Glossary of 
Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process, 
GAO–05–734SP (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 2005), 
at 61. The President has no unilateral au-
thority to withhold funds from obligation. 
See B–135564, July 26, 1973. The ICA, however, 
allows the President to impound budget au-
thority in limited circumstances. The Presi-
dent may temporarily withhold funds from 
obligation—but not beyond the end of the 
fiscal year—by proposing a ‘‘deferral.’’ ICA, 
§ 1013; 2 U.S.C. § 684. The President may also 
seek the permanent cancellation of funds for 
fiscal policy or other reasons, including the 
termination of programs for which Congress 
has provided budget authority, by proposing 
a ‘‘rescission.’’ ICA, § 1012; 2 U.S.C. § 683. 
When the President transmits a special mes-
sage proposing a rescission of budget author-
ity (a rescission proposal) in accordance with 
the ICA, amounts proposed for rescission 
may be impounded (that is, withheld from 
obligation) for a period of 45 calendar days of 
continuous congressional session. See ICA, 
§ 1012; 2 U.S.C. § 683. The Act states that such 
amounts ‘‘shall be made available for obliga-
tion unless, within the prescribed 45-day pe-
riod, the Congress has completed action on a 
rescission bill rescinding all or part of the 
amount proposed to be rescinded or that is 
to be reserved.’’ ICA, § 1012(b); 2 U.S.C. 
§ 683(b). Section 1017 of the ICA establishes 
expedited procedures to facilitate Congress’s 
consideration of a rescission bill during the 
45-day period. ICA, § 1017; 2 U.S.C. § 688. This 
opinion 
focuses 
on 
the 
withholding 
of 
amounts pursuant to a rescission proposal. 
DISCUSSION 
The ICA authorizes the President to with-
hold funds from obligation under limited cir-
cumstances. At issue here is whether the ICA 
allows the withholding of a fixed-period ap-
propriation, pursuant to the President’s 
transmission of a rescission proposal, to con-
tinue through the date on which the funds 
would expire. 
POWERS GRANTED BY THE ICA ARE LIMITED 
To interpret the ICA, we begin with the 
text of the statute and give ordinary mean-
ing to statutory terms, unless otherwise de-
fined. Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.S. 369,376 (2013); 
BP America Production Co. v. Burton, 549 U.S. 
84, 91 (2006). Section 1012(b) states that funds 
proposed to be rescinded ‘‘shall be made 
available for obligation unless, within the 
prescribed 45-day period, the Congress has 
completed action on a rescission bill rescind-
ing all or part of the amount proposed to be 
rescinded . . . .’’ Use of the conjunction ‘‘un-
less’’ denotes that the clause that follows 
provides an exception to the rule that pre-
cedes the term. See American Heritage Dic-
tionary (4th ed. 2009) (defining ‘‘unless’’ as 
‘‘except on the condition that’’ and ‘‘except 
under the circumstances that’’). Further, 
‘‘shall,’’ in the context of a statute, gen-
erally means ‘‘must.’’ Ballentine’s Law Dic-
tionary (3d ed. 2010) (defining shall as ‘‘the 
equivalent of ‘must,’ where appearing in a 
statute’’). See also Western Minnesota Munic-
ipal Power Agency v. FERC, 806 F.3d. 588, 592 
(D.C. Cir. 2015) (‘‘shall give preference’’ was a 
mandatory directive to the commission); 
Drummond Coal Co. v. Watt, 735 F.2d 469, 473 
(11th Cir. 1984) (noting ‘‘ ‘shall’ is a manda-
tory, not permissive form’’). The phrase 
‘‘shall be made available’’ thus constitutes a 
mandatory directive that funds proposed for 
rescission be made available for obligation, 
and the term ‘‘unless’’ denotes the single ex-
ception to this requirement. 
The text of section 1012(b) then provides 
that the only mechanism that permits budg-
et authority to be permanently withheld is 
Congress’s completion of action on a rescis-
sion bill within the 45-day period. 
An appropriation is available to incur new 
obligations only during its period of avail-
ability, which, for a fixed-period appropria-
tion, is a finite period of time. See 31 U.S.C. 
§ 1551(a)(3). See also 31 U.S.C. §§ 1501, 1502 (ob-
ligation of a fixed-period appropriation must 
correspond to the bona fide needs of the ap-
propriation’s period of availability and must 
be executed before the end of such period). 
For example, an agency may use a one-year 
appropriation to obligate the government for 
expenses properly chargeable to that year, or 
may use a multiple-year appropriation to ob-
ligate the government for expenses properly 
chargeable to that multiple-year period. But 
the government may not incur obligations 
against such appropriations after the rel-
evant time frame, as the budget authority’s 
period of availability would have ended. 
Immediately after the period of avail-
ability for obligation of a fixed-period appro-
priation ends, the budget authority is ‘‘ex-
pired’’ and no longer available to incur new 
obligations. Glossary, at 23 (defining expired 
budget authority). See also 18 Comp. Gen. 969 
(1939). An expired account is only available 
to record, to adjust, and to liquidate obliga-
tions properly chargeable to that account

during the account’s period of availability. 
31 U.S.C. § 1553(a). Notably, the permissible 
uses of an expired appropriation relate back 
to obligations incurred during the period of 
availability of the funds and do not con-
stitute new obligations themselves. 
The plain language of section 1012(b) pro-
vides that absent Congress’s completion of 
action on a rescission bill rescinding all or 
part of amounts proposed to be rescinded 
within the prescribed 45-day period, such 
amounts must be made available for obligation. 
The authority to withhold is not severable 
from the provision’s requirement regarding 
the release of the funds. Indeed, the provi-
sion permits a temporary withholding of 
budget authority, and otherwise requires its 
availability for obligation in all other cir-
cumstances. As budget authority is available 
to incur obligations only during its period of 
availability, implicit in the ICA’s require-
ment under section 1012(b) that budget au-
thority be ‘‘made available for obligation’’ is 
that such budget authority must not be ex-
pired. Because a fixed-period appropriation is 
current only for a definite period of time, 
section 1012(b) of the ICA requires that if 
Congress does not enact a rescission bill, the 
appropriation must be made available for ob-
ligation during that finite period. After this 
finite period has ended, the appropriation is 
expired and cannot be available for new obli-
gations. 
Consequently, the ICA does not permit 
budget authority proposed for rescission to 
be withheld until its expiration simply be-
cause the 45-day period has not yet elapsed. 
A withholding of this nature would be an 
aversion both to the constitutional process 
for enacting federal law and to Congress’s 
constitutional power of the purse, for the 
President would preclude the obligation of 
budget authority Congress has already en-
acted and did not rescind. For example, con-
sider a situation where fiscal year budget au-
thority is withheld pursuant to a special 
message submitted less than 45 days before 
the end of the fiscal year and where, upon 
conclusion of the 45-day period, Congress has 
not completed action on a corresponding re-
scission bill. An interpretation of section 
1012(b) that would permit the withholding of 
such budget authority for the duration of the 
45-day period would result in the expiration 
of the funds during that period. The expired 
amounts then could not be made available 
for obligation despite Congress not having 
completed action on a bill rescinding the 
amounts, as expired appropriations are not 
available for obligation. The ICA represents 
an agreement between the legislative and ex-
ecutive branches, whereby the President 
may withhold budget authority for a limited 
period during which Congress may consider 
the corresponding proposal to rescind the 
amounts using expedited procedures. The ex-
piration of these amounts would frustrate 
the design of the ICA, as it would contravene 
the plain meaning of section 1012(b), which 
requires that amounts not rescinded during 
this period of consideration be ‘‘made avail-
able for obligation.’’ 
Regardless of whether the 45-day period for 
congressional consideration provided in the 
ICA approaches or spans the date on which 
funds would expire, section 1012(b) requires 
that budget authority be made available in 
sufficient time to be prudently obligated. 
The amount of time required for prudent ob-
ligation will vary from one program to an-
other. In some programs, prudent obligation 
may require hours or days, while others may 
require weeks or months. We have previously 
signaled 
that 
the 
consequence 
of 
an 
unenacted rescission proposal should be the 
full and prudent obligation of the budget au-
thority. B–115398, Aug. 27, 1976. In 1976, the 
President submitted a special message for 
which the 45-day period would end on Sep-
tember 29, 1976, leaving one day to obligate 
appropriations that were withheld. Id. We 
noted this one-day period could be insuffi-
cient to prudently obligate the funds. Id. We 
found the timing of the proposal ‘‘particu-
larly troublesome’’ as it could ‘‘operate to 
deny to the Congress the expected con-
sequence of its rejecting a rescission pro-
posal—the full and prudent use of the budget 
authority.’’ Id. 
We have drawn similar conclusions con-
cerning deferrals under the ICA. In such 
cases we have noted that deferred funds must 
be released in sufficient time to allow them 
to be prudently obligated. See B–216664, Apr. 
12, 1985 (emphasizing that deferral, under the 
President’s sixth special message for fiscal 
year 1985, of amounts scheduled to expire 
should not extend beyond the point at which 
the funds could be prudently obligated). See 
also 54 Comp. Gen. 453 (1974) (recognizing 
that a deferral of budget authority that 
‘‘could be expected with reasonable certainty 
to lapse before [it] could be obligated, or 
would have to be obligated imprudently to 
avoid that consequence’’ constitutes a de 
facto rescission, and must be reclassified as 
a rescission proposal). 
The legislative history of the ICA supports 
this construction of section 1012(b). During 
consideration of the report of the committee 
of conference on H.R. 7130, 93rd Cong. (1974), 
which was ultimately enacted into law as 
the ICA, members recognized that affirma-
tive congressional action is required for a re-
scission of funds under the language of sec-
tion 1012. Senator Sam J. Ervin, Jr., the 
sponsor of a related bill, stated regarding 
section 1012: 
‘‘[The purpose) is to provide an orderly 
method by which differences of opinion may 
be reconciled between the President and 
Congress in respect to the amounts of appro-
priations sought . . . The recommendation of 
the President that an appropriation be elimi-
nated or reduced in and of itself would have no 
legal effect whatsoever. In other words, for it 
to become effective, both Houses of Congress, 
by a majority vote, would have to take ac-
tion either eliminating the appropriation or 
reducing the appropriation . . . I might say 
that the 45-day provision is placed in the bill 
for the purpose of spurring speedy congres-
sional action, but with recognition of the 
fact that Congress cannot deprive itself of 
any other power it has under the Constitu-
tion.’’ 
120 Cong. Rec. 20,473 (June 21, 1974) (state-
ment of Sen. Ervin) (emphasis added). As one 
member stated succinctly when discussing 
similar language: ‘‘the impoundment fails 
unless Congress acts affirmatively.’’ 119 
Cong. Rec. 15,236 (May 10, 1973) (statement of 
Sen. Roth) (debating S. 373, which would 
have required an impoundment to cease 
within 60 days unless it had been ratified by 
Congress). See also H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 93– 
1101, at 76 (1974); S. Conf. Rep. No. 93–924, at 
76 (1974) (‘‘Unless both Houses of Congress 
complete action on a rescission bill within 45 
days, the budget authority shall be made 
available for obligation.’’). 
Congress considered bill language under 
which an impoundment would have contin-
ued indefinitely unless Congress took spe-
cific action to affirmatively disapprove of the 
impoundment. H.R. 8480, 93rd Cong. (1973) 
(providing that an impoundment ‘‘shall cease 
if within [60] calendar days of continuous 
session after the date on which the message 
is received by the Congress the specific im-
poundment shall have been disapproved by 
either House . . .’’ (emphasis added)). How-
ever, Congress did not enact such language. 
Instead, Congress enacted legislation under 
which an impoundment becomes permanent 
only if Congress enacts appropriate legisla-
tion through the processes of bicameralism 
and presentment. 
Under the Constitution, the President 
must take care to execute the appropriations 
that Congress has enacted. Though the ICA 
permits the President to withhold amounts 
from 
obligation 
under 
limited 
cir-
cumstances, the amounts are permanently 
rescinded only if Congress takes affirmative 
legislative action through the constitutional 
processes of bicameralism and presentment. 
One must read the ICA as a whole. The Act 
outlines a process, and affords the President 
limited authority to withhold appropriated 
amounts while Congress expedites its consid-
eration of the President’s legislative pro-
posal to rescind the already enacted appro-
priations. It would be an abuse of this lim-
ited authority and an interference with 
Congress’s constitutional prerogatives if a 
President were to time the withholding of 
expiring budget authority to effectively 
alter the time period that the budget author-
ity is available for obligation from the time 
period established by Congress in duly en-
acted appropriations legislation. It would be 
inimical to the ICA and to its constitutional 
underpinnings for the executive to avail 
itself of the withholding authority in the 
ICA, but to ignore the remainder of the proc-
ess. See generally B–330376, Nov. 30, 2018 (citing 
NROC v. Abraham, 355 F.3d 179, 205 (2d Cir. 
2004)) (finding that agencies ‘‘cannot have it 
both ways,’’ claiming both the benefit of ad-
hering to a statutory provision, while simul-
taneously arguing that the requirements of 
the provision do not apply). Therefore, 
amounts proposed for rescission must be 
made available for prudent obligation before 
the amounts expire, even where the 45-day 
period for congressional consideration pro-
vided in the ICA approaches or spans the 
date on which funds would expire: the re-
quirement to make amounts available for 
obligation in this situation prevails over the 
privilege 
to 
temporarily 
withhold 
the 
amounts. OMB asserts that the ICA does not 
preclude an impoundment from persisting 
through the date on which amounts would 
expire. Response Letter, at 2. 
Specifically, OMB relies on the purported 
silence of section 1012 with regard to the 
President’s ability to propose rescissions 
under the ICA late in the fiscal year, as com-
pared to the language in section 1013, which 
governs the deferral of budget authority. Id. 
In particular, section 1013 states that a de-
ferral ‘‘may not be proposed for any period of 
time extending beyond the end of the fiscal 
year in which the special message proposing 
the deferral is transmitted to the House and 
the Senate[,]’’ and also provides that the 
provisions of the section, which necessarily 
includes this proscription, do not apply to 
amounts proposed for rescission under sec-
tion 1012. ICA, §§ 1013(a), (c); 2 U.S.C. §§ 684(a), 
(c). According to OMB, these distinctions 
demonstrate that section 1012 does not re-
quire the President to make withheld budget 
authority available for obligation before the 
end of the fiscal year. Response Letter, at 1. 
Under OMB’s rationale, the ICA grants the 
President authority to withhold funds for 
the entire 45-day period, even if such with-
holding would result in the expiration of im-
pounded balances. 
We disagree with OMB’s position. As a 
practical matter, OMB’s interpretation of 
the ICA would grant the President unilateral 
authority to rescind funds that are near ex-
piration by altering the time period that the 
budget authority is available for obligation 
from the time period established in existing 
law. Suppose the President were to transmit 
a special message less than 45 days before 
amounts are due to expire. In OMB’s view, an 
impoundment could continue through the 
funds’ date of expiration—at which point the 
funds would no longer be available for new 
obligations. Therefore, fiscal year funds pro-
posed for rescission in a special message late

in the fiscal year, even if not legally re-
scinded by the enactment of legislation, 
would be effectively rescinded if Congress 
takes no action at all. In OMB’s view, only 
through affirmative legislative action could 
Congress prevent the rescission of funds that 
the President proposes for rescission in a 
special message transmitted close to the 
date on which the funds would expire. OMB’s 
reading of the ICA would preempt the con-
gressional process by which the budget 
authority’s period of availability was estab-
lished, 
fundamentally 
ceding 
Congress’s 
power of the purse to the President. 
This interpretation would contradict the 
plain meaning of section 1012, which, by its 
terms, requires that amounts not rescinded 
through a rescission bill be made available 
for obligation. As previously discussed, this 
requirement that amounts be made available 
for obligation already limits the time frame 
during which such amounts may be permis-
sibly withheld; there is no need in section 
1012 for language that specifically prohibits 
amounts from being withheld beyond the end 
of the fiscal year. 
In addition, the legislative history of the 
ICA indicates that the distinctions between 
section 1012 and section 1013, on which OMB 
relies, do not carry the implications that 
OMB suggests. See 120 Cong. Rec. at 20,473 
(statements of Sen. Ervin and Sen. McClel-
lan) (discussing distinction between deferral 
and rescission proposals). Unlike a rescission 
proposal, through which the President seeks 
the permanent cancellation of budget au-
thority 
and 
may 
temporarily 
withhold 
amounts pending congressional consider-
ation, the ultimate objective of a deferral 
proposal is a temporary withholding only. 
Section 1013 was crafted to govern this tem-
porary withholding of budget authority and, 
thus, specifies that amounts may not be 
withheld beyond the end fiscal year. See id. 
In contrast, section 1012 limits withholding 
to the prescribed 45-day period, absent 
Congress’s completion of a bill rescinding 
the amounts proposed for rescission. Neither 
does section 1013(c), which provides that the 
provisions of section 1013 do not apply to re-
scission proposals submitted under section 
1012, support OMB’s position that there is no 
restriction on when the President may sub-
mit a rescission proposal. Rather, section 
1013(c) was intended to clarify that any ac-
tion that would seek the permanent can-
cellation of budget authority must be gov-
erned by the more stringent provisions of 
section 1012. See id. (statement of Sen. Ervin) 
(‘‘Any action or proposal which results in a 
permanent withholding of budget authority 
must be proposed under section 1012. Section 
1013(c) specifically provides that section 1013 
does not apply to cases to which section 1012 
applies. Only temporary withholding may be 
proposed under section 1013 . . .’’). 
Through the ICA, Congress did not grant 
the President the extraordinarily broad re-
scissions authority that OMB asserts. In-
deed, the ICA grants the President no au-
thority whatsoever to rescind funds. The Act 
allows the President to transmit legislative 
proposals for rescission to Congress, while 
granting the President authority to withhold 
the funds for limited periods of time while 
Congress considers the proposals. Congress 
considered, and did not enact, language that 
would have granted the President authority 
to propose rescissions that would take per-
manent effect if Congress took no action. In-
stead, as we discussed above, under the ICA 
only Congress may rescind budget authority. 
Under the Constitution, Congress enacts 
laws, and the President must take care to 
faithfully execute the terms of those laws, 
including appropriations acts. Within this 
framework, Congress enacted the ICA, which 
granted the President strictly circumscribed 
authority to temporarily withhold funds 
from obligation. The overarching constitu-
tional framework of the executive and legis-
lative powers, as well as the statutory text 
and legislative history of the ICA, provide no 
basis to construe the ICA as a mechanism by 
which the President may, in effect, unilater-
ally shorten the availability of budget au-
thority by transmitting strategically-timed 
special messages. Rather, amounts proposed 
for rescission must be made available for 
prudent obligation before the amounts ex-
pire, even where the 45-day period for con-
gressional consideration in the ICA ap-
proaches or spans the date on which the 
funds would expire. 
PRIOR OPINIONS 
We have previously considered situations 
in which the President transmitted special 
messages concerning amounts that were near 
their date of expiration. We have intimated 
that in such a situation, the President may 
withhold the budget authority from obliga-
tion for the duration of the 45-day period, 
and that Congress must take affirmative ac-
tion to prevent the withheld funds from ex-
piring. See, e.g., B–115398, Dec. 15, 1975. In 
some instances we have simply noted that 
funds may expire, without stating whether 
the funds were properly withheld or report-
ing that they must be made available for ob-
ligation. See, e.g., B–115398, Aug. 27, 1976. See 
also B–220532, Sept. 19, 1986 (reclassifying de-
ferral as rescission proposal, recognizing po-
tential for funds to expire before being able 
to be obligated for intended purpose). As we 
explain below, in light of Supreme Court 
precedent and subsequent amendments to 
the ICA, we overrule these prior opinions. 
In the President’s second special message 
for fiscal year 1976, submitted on July 26, 
1975, he included two rescission proposals of 
budget authority scheduled to expire on Sep-
tember 30, 1975. B–115398, Aug. 12, 1975. In our 
review of the special message, we stated that 
these amounts would lapse nearly a month 
before expiration of the 45-day period, B– 
115398, Aug. 12, 1975, and, in a subsequent re-
port on the status of funds, confirmed the 
amounts had in fact lapsed during the 45-day 
period, B–115398, Dec. 15, 1975. In our report 
on the status of the funds, we stated that 
‘‘having to wait 45 days of continuous session 
before it can be determined that a proposed 
rescission has been rejected is a major defi-
ciency of the [ICA].’’ B–115398, Dec. 15, 1975. 
We offered that Congress should have an af-
firmative means within the Act to address 
scenarios such as this, by, for example 
‘‘changing the Act to allow a rescission reso-
lution as is now allowed for deferrals, or 
changing the Act to prevent funds from laps-
ing where the 45-day period has not expired.’’ 
Id. We stated that with respect to the two re-
scission proposals, ‘‘Congress was unable, 
under the Act, to reject the rescission in 
time to prevent the budget authority from 
lapsing.’’ Id. When the ICA was enacted, it 
required deferred funds to be made available 
if either house of Congress passed an ‘‘im-
poundment resolution’’ disapproving of the 
deferral. Pub. L. No. 93–344, § 1013(b) (prior to 
1987 amendment). In 1975, we suggested that 
Congress create an analogous process to en-
able rejection of a rescission proposal. B– 
115398, Dec. 15, 1975. However, our statement 
predated INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, in which 
the Supreme Court held a one-house veto 
provision to be unconstitutional because it 
was an exercise of legislative power that cir-
cumvented the procedures of bicameralism 
and presentment. The deferral provision in 
the ICA was later eliminated in the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaf-
firmation Act of 1987. Pub. L. No. 100–119, 
title II, § 206. 
Our 1975 opinions are based on the premise 
that Congress could amend the ICA to pro-
vide Congress with a unilateral mechanism 
to reject a rescission proposal. In addition to 
Chadha, other Supreme Court decisions also 
have resoundingly invalidated this premise. 
See Clinton, 524 U.S. 417, 438–41; Chadha, 462 
U.S. at 951–58. As the Court made clear in 
Clinton, the Constitution vests the President 
with authority to ‘‘initiate and influence 
legislative proposals.’’ 524 U.S. at 438 (empha-
sis added). A rescission proposal is one such 
legislative proposal. The rescission proposal 
does not have the force of law: ‘‘[t]here is no 
provision in the Constitution that authorizes 
the President to enact, to amend, or to re-
peal statutes.’’ Id. 
Because bicameral passage by Congress is 
necessary for the President’s proposal to be-
come law, no congressional action is nec-
essary to invalidate the President’s proposal. 
Without affirmative congressional action, 
the President’s proposal remains just that: a 
proposal. Our 1975 opinions intimate that, 
under some circumstances, congressional in-
action on a rescission proposal can be tanta-
mount to affirmative congressional action to 
enact the rescission proposal. This interpre-
tation would, in effect, give the President 
power to amend or to repeal previously en-
acted appropriations merely by calibrating 
the timing of the submission of a special 
message. This interpretation is clearly con-
trary to the Supreme Court’s rulings in 
Chadha and Clinton. See 524 U.S. at 448–49; 462 
U.S. at 951–58. Therefore, we overrule our 
prior inconsistent opinions. 
CONCLUSION 
The terms of the ICA are strictly limited. 
They vest in the President limited authority 
to propose a rescission of budget authority 
and to withhold such budget authority from 
obligation for a limited time period during 
which Congress may avail itself of expedited 
procedures to consider the proposal. How-
ever, the statutory text and legislative his-
tory of the ICA, Supreme Court case law, and 
the overarching constitutional framework of 
legislative and executive powers provide no 
basis to construe the ICA as a mechanism by 
which the President may, in effect, unilater-
ally shorten the availability of budget au-
thority by transmitting rescission proposals 
shortly before amounts are due to expire. 
To dedicate such broad authority to the 
President would have required affirmative 
congressional action in legislation, not con-
gressional silence. See, e.g., B–303961, Dec. 6, 
2004 (declining to interpret a general ‘‘not-
withstanding’’ clause to imply a waiver of 
the Antideficiency Act without indication 
that Congress intended to relinquish its 
‘‘strongest means’’ to enforce its power of 
the purse). To paraphrase the Supreme 
Court, Congress does not alter the funda-
mental details of its constitutional power of 
the purse through vague terms or ancillary 
provisions—‘‘it does not, one might say, hide 
elephants in mouseholes.’’ See Whitman v. 
American Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 
(2001) (declining to interpret a statute in a 
manner inconsistent with its plain meaning). 
A construction of the ICA that would permit 
the withholding of funds proposed for rescis-
sion through their date of expiration would 
be precisely this elephant. 
Though the ICA permits the President to 
withhold amounts from obligation under 
limited circumstances, the amounts are re-
scinded only if Congress takes affirmative 
legislative action through the constitutional 
processes of bicameralism and presentment. 
Therefore, amounts proposed for rescission 
must be made available for prudent obliga-
tion before the amounts expire, even where 
the 45-day period for congressional consider-
ation in the ICA approaches or spans the

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF SAINT 
ELMO VILLAGE 
HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, on May 25, 
2019, Saint Elmo Village celebrated 50 years 
as an artist colony that has worked to bring art 
into the everyday lives of young and old in the 
heart of Los Angeles. I congratulate all of the 
past and present residents, teachers, neigh-
bors and supporters. I also commend its com-
munity of citizens for using their powers of 
creativity and artistic expression to create an 
oasis of beauty in Mid-City. 
Saint Elmo Village was founded in 1969 by 
painter Rozzell Sykes, once featured in Life 
magazine, and his artist nephew Roderick 
Sykes, who hoped to use a small group of 
bungalows in the 4800 block of St. Elmo Drive 
to enhance the neighborhood and to further 
their artistic visions. Their goals: to capitalize 
on a thriving art scene in Southern California; 
construct a space to nurture urban and African 
American artists; and to prove that everyone 
has creative talents. 
The Village continued to gain prestige, with 
the Sykes receiving numerous public art com-
missions and international recognition for their 
work, specifically in painting and photography. 
Soon enough, Saint Elmo welcomed resident 
artists to expand the diversity and types of 
pieces created at the Village. 
With creativity at its core, Saint Elmo Village 
consistently emphasizes the inclusive aspects 
of art-making. Now under the leadership of ex-
ecutive director Jacqueline Sykes, the organi-
zation holds workshops and art showings tai-
lored to the idea that all people can be cre-
ative. 
Community engagement stands as a corner-
stone of the Village’s mission. St. Elmo offers 
a creative space for locals and hosts art class-
es, festivals, and numerous educational en-
richment programs to spread love for art in the 
Mid-City neighborhood. 
Guided by a singular phrase, ‘‘Do What You 
Love—Love What You Do’’ Saint Elmo Village 
has spent a half-century enriching Los Ange-
les. I congratulate Saint Elmo Village on its 
host of accolades, and I look forward to an-
other half century of memorable milestones.

RECOGNIZING LISA WILLIAMS OF 
COLLEYVILLE, TEXAS FOR HER 
OUTSTANDING WORK 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Lisa Williams for her tire-
less devotion to helping victims of human traf-
ficking overcome the many challenges they 
face. As a distinguished leader in the non- 
profit community, Lisa has been working to 
counter the tragic effects of child abuse and 
sexual exploitation since she founded Circle of 
Friends: Celebrating Life, Inc. in 1999. 
From the outset, Circle of Friends has col-
laborated 
with 
various 
stakeholders 
to 
fundraise and create awareness about the 
systemic issues that human trafficking pre-
sents to communities across the country. 
Under Lisa’s guidance, other programs were 
established to further this goal, such as Living 
Water for Women, Living Water for Girls and 
the Living Water Learning Resource Center. 
Through these channels, Lisa has focused on 
providing services that are based on proven 
intervention and rehabilitative strategies, such 
as creating spaces for safe refuge, delivering 
therapeutic treatments, and facilitating edu-
cational and career opportunities for victims of 
sex trafficking. 
For over twenty years, Lisa’s work has en-
abled women and children to heal by way of 
an extensive network of support services. Her 
efforts will continue through the Circle of 
Friends Impact Legacy Scholarship Fund, a 
dollar-for-dollar, matched endowment that is 
administered by the Century Challenge at 
Boston University. The Circle of Friends schol-
arship fund will empower survivors of adverse 
sexual experiences to pursue an education 
and achieve self-sufficiency. 
Ms. Williams’s philanthropic endeavors have 
undoubtedly served as a beacon of hope to 
many. Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rec-
ognize the remarkable work that Lisa has pro-
duced in support of human trafficking victims. 
I ask all my distinguished colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Lisa Williams for her distin-
guished years of service.

WHY IMPOUNDMENT CONTROL ACT 
MATTERS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD the December 2019 House 
Budget Committee report outlining the timeline 
of actions taken by the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB), the seemingly unprece-
dented step of stripping career officials of their 
normal role in the apportionment process, and 
how the OMB’s actions hindered agencies’ 
ability to obligate funds by the end of the fiscal 
year. I am submitting this in the RECORD to 
help inform the public of the Administration’s 
systematic disregard of Congress’ constitu-
tional authority, separation of powers prin-
ciples, and the Impoundment Control Act. 
On September 27, House Budget Chairman 
John Yarmuth (KY–03) and House Appropria-
tions Chairwoman Nita Lowey (NY–17) sent a 
letter to the Trump administration express-
ing ‘‘serious concerns’’ that recent actions 
taken by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) constitute unlawful impound-
ments and are an abuse of the authority del-
egated to OMB to apportion appropriations. 
As part of the committees’ efforts to ensure 
Congress maintains the power of the purse, 
as established in the Constitution, the 
Chairs requested documents and answers re-
garding OMB’s involvement in the with-
holding of foreign aid, including nearly $400 
million in crucial security assistance fund-
ing for Ukraine. 
The committees received a partial produc-
tion from OMB, however, OMB failed to meet 
the committees’ deadlines and has not pro-
vided the bulk of the documents. 
SUMMARY 
After careful review of the materials pro-
vided to the committees, the Chairs have be-
come more concerned that the apportion-
ment process has been abused to undermine 
Congress’s constitutional power of the purse. 
Specifically: 
1. The timeline of actions taken by OMB 
(as seen in the provided apportionments, 
which are legally binding documents) sug-
gest a pattern of abuse of the apportionment 
process, OMB’s authority, and current law. 
2. OMB took the seemingly unprecedented 
step of stripping career officials of their nor-
mal role in the apportionment process and 
instead vesting a political appointee with 
that authority. This is a troubling deviation 
from long-standing procedures. 
3. OMB’s actions may have hindered agen-
cies’ ability to prudently obligate funds by 
the end of the fiscal year in violation of the 
Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA), pos-
sibly creating backdoor rescissions. 
TIMELINE 
June 19, 2019: OMB asserts in our docu-
ments that they first inquired with the De-
partment of Defense about the Ukraine Secu-
rity Assistance Initiative (USAI). 
July 18, 2019: OMB admits in our docu-
ments (and it has been reported) that they 
notified 
an 
interagency 
working 
group, 
which included DoD and the State Depart-
ment, about an instruction to withhold all 
funds for Ukraine security assistance. 
July 25, 2019 at 6:44pm ET: the first appor-
tionment withholding $250 million in DoD 
funding for USAI until August 5, 2019, is 
signed by an OMB career official. OMB con-
firms in our documents that this is the first 
written apportionment action and states 
that USAI funds were not made available to 
DoD until September 12. 
August 3, 2019: a letter apportionment 
signed by Michael Duffey (the OMB political 
appointee) withholds State/USAID foreign 
aid, including $26.5 million in Foreign Mili-
tary Financing (FMF) funding from the FY18 
appropriations act for assistance to Ukraine. 
The apportionment responsibility for these 
accounts is not returned to the career offi-
cial for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
August 6, 2019 at 2:22pm ET: Michael 
Duffey (the OMB political appointee) signs 
an apportionment withholding the DoD fund-
ing for USAI until August 12, 2019. The ap-
portionment responsibility for this account 
is not returned to the career official for the 
remainder of the fiscal year. 
August 9, 2019: The House (majority) and 
Senate (minority) Appropriations Commit-
tees write to OMB and the White House 
warning the Trump administration that the 
August 3 letter apportionment for State/ 
USAID foreign aid may constitute an illegal 
impoundment of funds and urging the admin-
istration to adhere to the law and obligate

the withheld funding. Duffey signs another 
letter apportionment for State/USAID for-
eign aid, continuing to withhold the funding 
withheld by the August 3 Letter by releasing 
only about 2% of funds each day, preventing 
the normal spending of these funds. (DoD 
USAI funds continue to be withheld.) 
August 19, 2019: The House (majority) and 
Senate (minority) Budget Committees write 
to OMB and the White House urging the ad-
ministration to respect Congress’s constitu-
tional authority and to comply with appro-
priations law and the ICA, in particular as it 
applies to the State/USAID foreign aid with-
held by Duffey. 
August 29, 2019: Duffey signs another letter 
apportionment for the State/USAID foreign 
aid, continuing to withhold remaining fund-
ing previously withheld by the August 3 and 
August 9 letters by releasing 25% of the 
funds each Sunday between September 1 and 
September 22, preventing the normal spend-
ing of these funds. (DoD USAI funds continue 
to be withheld.) 
September 11, 2019: A letter was sent to 
Congress (dated September 11, 2019) by the 
State Department notifying the agency’s in-
tent to obligate the $141.5 million in FMF 
funding for Ukraine. Following notification, 
the funds were held for an additional period 
before being released by OMB on September 
27 ($115 million from the FY19 appropriations 
act) and September 30 ($26.5 million from the 
FY18 appropriations act) through apportion-
ments also signed by Duffey. 
September 12, 2019: Subsequent actions by 
Duffey extended the DoD USAI withholding 
until September 12. 
September 18, 2019: The House Budget and 
Appropriations Committees write to OMB 
expressing concerns over the agency’s abuse 
of its apportionment authorities and ques-
tions its compliance with the Antideficiency 
Act and the Impoundment Control Act of 
1974. 
September 27, 2019: The House Budget and 
Appropriations Committees write to OMB re-
questing answers and documents related to 
the withholding of Ukraine aid, State and 
USAID funds, and possible abuses of the ap-
portionment process. 
September 30, 2019: The fiscal year ends. 
Preliminary and public reporting from State 
and 
USAID 
indicates 
that 
significant 
amounts of the withheld FMF funding were 
not obligated before that deadline. Addition-
ally, a portion of the $250 million DoD USAI 
funding was not obligated. The 2019 Con-
tinuing Resolution (P.L. 116–59) extended the 
deadline to obligate any and all of the re-
maining USAI funding by a full year; pre-
liminary and public reporting from DoD indi-
cates that amount totaled $35.2 million. 
NEXT STEPS 
Although the committees only received a 
partial production of the requested mate-
rials, OMB’s responses and documentation to 
date confirm that the apportionment process 
has been misused to withhold Congression-
ally enacted appropriations. Increased trans-
parency and accountability for the appor-
tionment process would serve both Congress 
and the public. 
As the committees consider legislative 
proposals and reforms to rein in OMB’s abuse 
of its apportionment responsibilities (espe-
cially in the context of the Impoundment 
Control Act of 1974 and the annual appropria-
tions acts), these findings—and the pending 
document requests—are key. 
CONGRATULATING LIZ PAUGH ON 
HER RETIREMENT 
HON. DANIEL MEUSER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and appreciation that I rise today 
to honor Liz Paugh of Lebanon, who is retiring 
from the United States Department of Vet-
erans Affairs after serving our nation’s incred-
ible veterans for over 30 years. 
Ms. Paugh began her career on December 
11, 1989 at the Lebanon VA Medical Center in 
the Nutrition and Food Service Department. 
While serving in this role, she took great care 
to ensure Veterans meals fit of their diet and 
any medical needs. After, she was promoted 
to oversee Ingredient Control at the Lebanon 
VA. 20 years after her career began at the 
Lebanon VA, she accepted a position in Net-
work Contracting Office 4 as a Purchasing 
Agent where she continued to support the 
Lebanon VA in a different capacity, through 
administrative contracting support. Throughout 
her long and distinguished career, Ms. Paugh 
faithfully provided heartfelt service to our Vet-
erans. 
Although she is culminating an impressive 
and impactful career, I am confident that as 
she begins this new chapter, she will continue 
to be a positive influence and a dedicated 
member of our great community. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and the citizens of Pennsylvania’s Ninth 
Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating Ms. Paugh on her re-
tirement and thank her for her many years of 
dedicated service to our Veterans and our 
great nation.

HONORING JIM LYALL 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor the First District of 
Oklahoma’s January Veteran of the Month, 
Jim Lyall. 
A sergeant in the United States Army, Mr. 
Lyall honorably served our country in the Viet-
nam conflict. Throughout his time in the mili-
tary, Mr. Lyall earned the National Defense 
Service Medal, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, 
the Vietnam Service Medal, an Army Com-
mendation with Valor, the Good Conduct 
Medal, the Combat Infantryman Badge, and 
he received a Citation for Valor on September 
27, 1968. Mr. Lyall’s courageous and valorous 
service in the name of freedom is truly honor-
able. 
Following his departure from the military, 
Jim became a tireless servant for the veterans 
of northeastern Oklahoma. Currently, he 
serves as the Veterans Outreach Coordinator 
for the Community Food Bank of Eastern 
Oklahoma, ensuring that those who have 
served our country have access to meals. Mr. 
Lyall also currently sits on the Board of Direc-
tors for the Coffee Bunker, a Tulsa non-profit, 
that seeks to meet veterans ‘‘where they are’’ 
and help them transition to family and commu-
nity life following their service. 
Before his retirement in 2017, Jim served at 
the Community Service Council beginning in 
1980, retiring as the Associate Director. Mr. 
Lyall helped spearhead many of the programs 
that help to make the Community Service 
Council a premier service organization in 
Oklahoma and, in spite of his retirement, re-
mains active with the Council. He currently 
serves as a Resource Member for the Com-
munity Service Council and is active in their 
Oklahoma Veteran Alliance program. 
Jim Lyall lives a life of unmatched dedica-
tion, sacrifice, and service to our great nation. 
He answered the call to defend freedom 
across the globe and sacrificed whatever was 
necessary in the name of that noble cause. 
He continues to serve our country, community, 
and his fellow veterans at a high level on a 
daily basis. It is my honor to recognize Jim 
Lyall as the 1st Congressional District of Okla-
homa’s January Veteran of the Month.

WHY IMPOUNDMENT CONTROL ACT

SPEECH OF 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD the letter to the Office of Man-
agement and Budget questioning the Trump 
Administration for declaring bogus national 
emergencies to usurp funds Congress appro-
priated for military construction and counter-
narcotic initiatives to use for the President’s 
border wall. I am submitting this in the 
RECORD to help inform the public of the Ad-
ministration’s systematic disregard of Con-
gress’ constitutional authority, separation of 
powers principles, and the lmpoundment Con-
trol Act. 
MARCH 8, 2019. 
The Hon. RUSSELL VOUGHT, 
Acting Director, 
Office of Management and Budget. 
DEAR ACTING DIRECTOR VOUGHT: The Presi-
dent’s announcement to spend up to $6.725 
billion in additional funding for construction 
of a border wall or barrier came at the end of 
bipartisan negotiations on an agreed-to fund-
ing level of $1.375 billion for Fiscal Year (FY) 
2019 for border security. The executive action 
plan further specified that the $6.725 billion 
would be used sequentially as follows: $601 
million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, 
up to $2.5 billion under the Department of 
Defense funds transferred for Support for

Counterdrug Activities (10 U.S.C. § 284), and 
up to $3.6 billion reallocated from Depart-
ment 
of 
Defense 
military 
construction 
projects under the President’s declaration of 
a national emergency (10 U.S.C. § 2808). How-
ever, important budgetary details of the plan 
have not yet been provided, including the 
specific funding sources and additional au-
thorities that would be used and the pro-
grams, projects, and activities from which 
funds would be diverted. 
As the Article I branch, it is essential that 
Congress remains at the center of funding 
decisions, especially decisions that Congress 
has spent considerable time debating and ne-
gotiating. We have significant concerns with 
the Administration’s plan, and we are frus-
trated by the lack of transparency from the 
Administration. Congress should receive ade-
quate information to consider the use of the 
$6.725 billion referenced in the President’s 
executive action plan. The executive action 
plan also needs to be considered in the con-
text of fast-approaching deadlines for a 
budget resolution and decisions about the 
discretionary cap levels for the appropria-
tions process, as well as for Article I equities 
more broadly. To that end, we request that 
you provide the following documents and in-
formation: 
1. All documents prepared for or relating 
to meetings about or decisions by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) Director, 
Acting Director, Deputy Director, Associate 
Director(s), Deputy Associate Director(s), or 
any other OMB or White House official or 
staff concerning the President’s executive 
action plan to use up to $6.725 billion to build 
a border wall, including statements of con-
clusions and background materials, received 
or produced by OMB in relation to inter-
agency meetings or discussions relating to 
the President’s executive action plan. 
2. All documents relating to the budgetary 
details of the President’s executive action 
plan to use up to $6.725 billion to build a bor-
der wall, including information on all af-
fected appropriations and Treasury Appro-
priation Fund Symbols (TAFS) by fiscal year 
and by program, project, or activity. 
3. All documents since January 20, 2017 re-
lating to any OMB Budget Data Request or 
any other OMB request to agencies to iden-
tify funding available to build a border wall 
or to otherwise fund border security or 
counterdrug activities at the border. 
4. All documents relating to the author-
ized, planned, or intended use of the $6.725 
billion prior to any consideration or deter-
mination that such amounts may be used in-
stead to build a border wall, including all 
documents relating to: 
a. The authorized, planned, or intended use 
of the ‘‘first tranche’’ of approximately $242 
million to be expended under the Treasury 
Forfeiture Fund (TFF); 
b. The authorized, planned, or intended use 
of the ‘‘second tranche’’ of approximately 
$359 million to be expended under the TFF; 
c. The authorized, planned, or intended use 
of the approximately $2.5 billion under the 
Department of Defense funds transferred for 
Support for Counterdrug Activities under 10 
U.S.C. § 284; 
d. The authorized, planned, or intended use 
of the approximately $3.6 billion reallocated 
from the Department of Defense military 
construction projects under the President’s 
declaration of a national emergency pursu-
ant to 10 U.S.C. § 2808. 
5. Any documents, including any guidance 
or instructions to agencies, relating to the 
de-obligation of funds, delay in obligation or 
expenditure, or any other change in the rate 
of obligation and expenditure involving the 
potential or planned use of such funds to 
carry out the President’s executive action 
plan. 
6. All documents relating to any spend 
plan for any appropriation account affected 
or relevant to the President’s executive ac-
tion plan to use up to $6.725 billion to build 
a border wall, including documents ex-
changed between or among OMB and the De-
partment of Defense, the Department of 
Homeland Security, or the Department of 
the Treasury. 
7. All documents relating to each appor-
tionment and reapportionment for FY 2019, 
including department or agency requests to 
OMB, for each affected or relevant TAFS re-
lated to the President’s executive action 
plan. This also includes all apportionment 
and reapportionment documentation for any 
TAFS from which funds would be contrib-
uted, to which funds would be contributed, 
from which transfers would be made, to 
which transfers would be made, in which 
transfers or reprogrammings would occur, or 
that is otherwise relevant in tallying (a) the 
‘‘$601 million’’ amount described by the Ad-
ministration from the TFF; (b) the ‘‘up to

istration pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 284; and (c)

2808.

programmatic basis upon which OMB appor-
tions or reapportions any TAFS to carry out 
the President’s executive action plan, in-
cluding any Administration legal opinion(s) 
prepared in whole or in part by, or in con-
sultation with, OMB, the Department of De-
fense, the Department of Homeland Security, 
the Department of the Treasury, the Depart-
ment of Justice, the National Security Coun-
cil, or the White House Counsel’s Office. 
9. All documents relating to the potential, 
planned, or completed obligations or outlays 
incurred for each appropriation and TAFS or 
any other budget execution steps to carry 
out the President’s executive action plan or 
in anticipation of potential use related to 
the plan. 
10. All other documents relating to the 
President’s executive action plan, including 
documents relating to (a) the Department of 
Homeland Security’s identification of prior-
ities for potential construction of a border 
wall and the relation to supporting the use 
of the armed forces, in accordance with 10 
U.S.C. 2808; (b) the Department of Homeland 
Security’s request of support from the De-
partment of Defense pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 284 
and any response from the Department of 
Defense; and (c) any contractual awards or 
modifications or any other changes to con-
tracting to carry out the President’s execu-
tive action plan. 
While the President has issued a national 
emergency proclamation, our committees 
are still responsible for performing their 
constitutional oversight responsibilities. As 
such, given the speed with which we believe 
the Administration may be acting in re-
sponse to the emergency proclamation, we 
request that you produce the requested docu-
ments and information no later than March 
22, 2019. 
We appreciate your time and attention to

to only a portion of any document, that por-
tion only should be withheld and the remain-
der of the document should be produced. As 
used herein, ‘‘claim of privilege’’ includes, 
but is not limited to, any claim that a docu-
ment either may or must be withheld from 
production pursuant to any statute, rule, or

ground(s) for withholding each withheld doc-
ument prior to the request compliance date. 
(b) In complying with the request, be ap-
prised that (unless otherwise determined by

holding or refusal, unless and only to the ex-
tent that the Committees (or the chairs of 
the Committees, if authorized) has consented 
to recognize the assertion as valid. 
18. If the request cannot be complied with

tent possible, which should include an expla-
nation of why full compliance is not possible. 
19. Upon completion of the document pro-
duction, you should submit a written certifi-
cation, signed by you or your counsel, stat-
ing that: (1) a diligent search has been com-
pleted of all documents in your possession, 
custody, or control which reasonably could 
contain responsive documents; and (2) all 
documents located during the search that

Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Chief Warrant Of-
ficer Douglas Englen for his distinguished ca-
reer in service to this nation. 
Over the course of more than three decades 
in the United States Army, Chief Douglas 
Englen has demonstrated exceptional skill, un-
wavering bravery, and valor in defense of free-
dom. As a helicopter pilot with the 160th Spe-
cial Operations Aviation Regiment, the elite 
unit tasked with helicopter support of special 
operations forces, Chief Englen has flown over 
2,500 combat missions in every major U.S. 
conflict since Operation Desert Storm. 
Chief Englen’s intrepid leadership played a 
crucial role in many key engagements and op-
erations, most notably Operation Neptune 
Spear. Englen served first as one of four key 
planners for this daring nighttime raid to take 
out Osama bin Laden, America’s most wanted 
terrorist. During the mission, he served as the 
flight lead for the strike force, for which he

third-highest 
combat 
decoration. 
Englen’s adept piloting through mountainous 
terrain enabled the strike force to approach 
bin Laden’s compound undetected and take 
out the man responsible for the deadliest ter-
rorist attack in human history. 
Englen’s exploits in defense of the country 
have resulted in his admittance into the Army 
Aviation Association of America Aviation Hall 
of Fame—an honor he shares with accom-
plished Army Aviators, including his fellow 
Night Stalker Michael Durant and numerous 
Medal of Honor recipients. Prior to retirement, 
Mr. Englen was noteworthy for being the most 
decorated Army Aviator on active duty. Doug 
Englen is a hero to heroes. 
It is altogether fitting that we honor Chief 
Englen as he concludes a remarkable career 
marked by his steadfast commitment to duty 
and country. He leaves the 160th SOAR with 
two Silver Stars, one Distinguished Service 
Medal, three Distinguished Flying Crosses, 
two Legions of Merit, two Bronze Stars, and 
eight Air Medals. On behalf of the United 
States Congress, I wish to commend Chief 
Englen for his faithful service to our nation, 
and I congratulate him on the occasion of his 
retirement from the United States Army.

SUPPORT FOR NO BAN ACT AND 
PREVENTING FUTURE DISCRIMI-
NATORY BANS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, let 
me offer my appreciation and thanks to Con-
gresswoman TLAIB of Michigan for anchoring 
an important special order on the National Ori-
gin-Based 
Antidiscrimination 
for 
Non-
immigrants Act or ‘‘No Ban Act,’’ legislation 
which terminates the Trump Administration’s 
so-called Muslim Ban and prevents future dis-
criminatory bans. 
As a senior member of the committees on 
the Judiciary and on Homeland Security, and 
the vice-Chair of Congressional Progressive 
Caucus, and the Chair of the Congressional 
Pakistan Caucus and the Congressional Nige-
ria Caucus, I am proud to support the No Ban 
Act because it broadens Section 202(a) of the 
Immigrant and Nationality Act to include a 
nondiscrimination provision which includes 
protection from religious discrimination and ap-
plies to all individuals traveling to the United 
States. 
Specifically, the No Ban Act ensures that 
this nondiscrimination provision applies to non-
immigrant visas, entry into the United States, 
or the approval or revocation of any immigra-
tion benefit. 
The legislation mandates that restrictions or 
suspensions entry must be supported by reli-
able and compelling evidence and that it is tai-
lored to the specified purpose and requires the 
consultation and input of the Secretary of 
State and Secretary of Homeland Security 
when suspending or restricting entry under 
Section 212(f). 
The No Ban Act preserves the President’s 
ability to use this authority when the Secretary 
of State determines, based on credible facts, 
that entry should be suspended or restricted to 
address specific acts that undermine the secu-
rity or public safety of the United States or of 
human rights or of democratic processes or in-
stitutions or endangers international stability. 
These permissible uses of Section 212(f) 
have been employed by previous Democratic 
and Republican presidents. 
The No Ban Act requires specific evidence 
supporting the use of Section 212(f), including 
evidence that is connected with the duration of 
the suspension or restriction and requires that 
the suspension or restriction must be narrowly 
tailored to address a compelling governmental 
interest, using the least restrictive means pos-
sible. 
Waivers for class-based restrictions and 
suspensions must be considered and the bill 
provides that there is a rebuttable presumption 
in favor of family-based and humanitarian 
waivers. 
The bill repeals the unilateral executive ac-
tions and three Muslim ban executive orders 
and presidential proclamations that have 
harmed the Muslim American community and 
damaged our standing in the world. 
I also approve the legislation’s repeal of the 
Trump executive order that instituted extreme 
vetting for refugees, as well as an asylum 
presidential proclamation that abused the Sec-
tion 212(f) authority. 
Another salutary aspect of the bill is that it 
ensures there will be congressional consulta-
tion and periodic reporting for any future use 
of Section 212(f) to ensure that Congress has 
data on visa applications and refugee admis-
sions to conduct critical oversight. 
If a briefing is not provided within 48 hours 
and updated every 30 days thereafter, the 
emergency suspension or action will terminate 
absent congressional action. 
Finally, the No Ban Act requires backward- 
looking reporting on how each of the executive 
orders and presidential proclamations was im-
plemented to ensure a complete reckoning. 
Given the harm created by the Muslim Ban 
upheld by the Supreme Court in its 5–4 deci-
sion in Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. ——, No. 
17–965 (June 26, 2018), is it any wonder that 
the NO BAN Act enjoys broad support from 
nearly 400 civil rights, faith-based, and com-
munity organizations, as well as the legal 
community, the ACLU, the National Immigra-
tion Law Center, the NAACP, the Leadership 
Conference on Civil and Human Rights, 
Church World Service, Amnesty International, 
and the International Refugee Assistance 
Project. 
It is useful to review how we got to this 
point. 
During the 2016 presidential campaign, 
then-candidate Donald Trump pledged at a 
political rally in Mount Pleasant, South Caro-
lina that, if elected, he would ban Muslims 
from entering the United States and was ‘‘call-
ing for a total and complete shutdown of Mus-
lims entering the United States.’’ 
On January 27, 2017, as President, Trump 
signed Executive Order No. 13,769 (EO–1), 
which, among other things, suspended entry 
for 90 days of foreign nationals from seven 
countries identified by Congress or the Execu-
tive as presenting heightened terrorism-related 
risks, which was immediately challenged and 
enjoined nationwide by a federal district court. 
Rather than continuing to litigate the matter, 
the government announced that it would re-
voke that order and issue a new one. 
On March 6, 2017, President Trump issued 
Executive Order No. 13,780 (EO–2), section 
2(c) of EO–2 of which directed that entry of 
nationals from six of the seven countries des-
ignated in EO–1 be suspended for 90 days 
from the effective date of the order, citing a 
need for time to establish adequate standards 
to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists. 
Section 6(a) of that executive order directed 
that applications for refugee status and travel 
of refugees into the United States under the 
United States Refugee Admissions Program 
(USRAP) be suspended for 120 days from the 
effective date ‘‘to review the adequacy of 
USRAP application and adjudication proce-
dures’’ and section 6(b) suspended the entry 
of any individual under USRAP once 50,000 
refugees have entered the United States in fis-
cal year 2017. 
On June 14, just before Section 2(c) of EO– 
2 was by its terms set to expire, President 
Trump issued a memorandum to Executive 
Branch officials declaring the effective date of 
each enjoined provision of EO–2 to be the 
date on which the injunctions in these cases 
‘‘are lifted or stayed with respect to that provi-
sion.’’ The government sought review in both 
cases, making arguments both on the merits 
of the cases and on procedural issues. 
On September 24, 2017, the President 
issued a Proclamation restricting travel to the 
United States by citizens from eight countries, 
which along with the previous executive orders 
was struck down by the Ninth Circuit before 
the United States Supreme Court granted cer-
tiorari and reversed the lower court by the nar-
row 5-4 margin. 
Let me share a story of how the President’s 
Muslim Ban affects people in real life, living in 
the real world, one of whom lived in my con-
gressional district. 
A few days after the first Muslim Ban was 
issued on January 27, 2017, I got a call to go 
to the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in 
my district. 
ICE had detained a Katy High School stu-
dent from Jordan following President Trump’s 
immigration ban. 
His name was Mohammad Abu Khadra. 
He was detained in Houston at the airport 
and then spirited away to Chicago when he 
returned from his native country a day after 
President Donald Trump issued his immigra-
tion ban. 
He was an innocent child who had gone 
home to renew the documents that allowed 
him to be in America. 
They had expired after he spent a few 
months living in the United States with his 
older brother. 
Mohammad Abu Khadra was just a young 
man who wanted to come to the United 
States, as many others do. 
The teenager looked every bit the part of an 
increasingly diverse America, with hair cut 
stylishly short on the sides and long on top, 
wearing a slim-fitting shirt, buttoned up to the 
collar, with rolled-up jeans and a big, blue 
wristwatch. 
His 37-year-old brother had lived in America 
for five years at the time. 
Mohammad had been taking courses in 
English as a second language. 
When Mohammad came to Texas on a tour-
ist visa a few months prior, he had no trouble 
and had the documents required. 
When he returned to renew his paperwork, 
he was doing exactly what was required of 
him. 
Landing back again in Houston, however, 
Mohammad had been swept up needlessly in

Trump’s ban which does not even include Jor-
dan, a longtime ally of the United States. 
They pulled him aside and kept asking him, 
‘‘What are you doing? Where are you going? 
What is your business?’’ 
The questions continued for a scared young 
boy thousands of miles away from home with-
out counsel. 
Mohammad told the truth about what he 
was doing while in the States. 
At some point during the questioning, Mo-
hammad told authorities that he was enrolled 
in school. 
Enrolling in public school is a violation of his 
visa, but we do not ask students their status 
in the school system in Harris County. 
He was taking only ESL courses—some-
thing he perhaps had not been able to explain. 
Authorities held Mohammdad, questioned 
him without counsel and then sent him to Chi-
cago to a detention center for an undeter-
mined amount of time. 
This is a 16-year-old boy, and this should 
not have happened to him. 
He was a minor, the case moved from the 
Department of Homeland Security to Health 
and Human Services, which eventually re-
leased him. 
The Muslim Ban was the first separation of 
children from their families and turned out be 
a harbinger of the cruelties and inhumanities 
to come. 
That is why we need to pass H.R. 2214, the 
No Ban Act.
