Let us pray. 
O Lord of love, lift our hearts above 
the mundane and ordinary. Inspire our

NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the past few weeks in the Senate have 
been 
extremely 
productive. 
Senate 
Democrats delivered on our promise to 
pass bold COVID relief legislation, and 
we have now confirmed 16 Cabinet-level 
officials. Today, we will continue mov-
ing the ball forward on the President’s 
nominees by confirming Representa-
tive DEB HAALAND to serve as President 
Biden’s Secretary of the Interior. 
Representative HAALAND has already 
made history as one of two Members to 
become the first Native American 
woman to serve in the House of Rep-
resentatives. She is a citizen of the La-
guna Pueblo nation, and her family’s 
roots in New Mexico can be traced back 
35 generations. By her own account, 
she grew up poor, moving frequently. 
Her mother served in the Navy, and her 
father spent a 30-year career in the Ma-
rines. While the Federal Government 
has often mistreated and neglected In-
digenous Americans, the Haaland fam-
ily has proudly and bravely served this 
country. Now Representative HAALAND 
is making history twice over as the 
first Native American Secretary of the 
Interior and as the first Native Amer-
ican Cabinet official in American his-
tory. 
Representative HAALAND’s confirma-
tion represents a gigantic step forward 
in creating a government that rep-
resents the full richness and diversity 
of this country because Native Ameri-
cans were, for far too long, neglected at 
the Cabinet level and in so many other 
places. 
Representative HAALAND will have an 
important task ahead of her. She must 
refocus the Interior Department on 
preserving and protecting almost 500 
million acres of public lands, com-
bating climate change and environ-
mental degradation, and upholding the 
Federal Government’s obligations to 
Tribal nations. The Trump administra-
tion did more to undermine the rela-
tionship between the Federal Govern-
ment and the sovereign Tribes than 
many have in decades—from dese-
crating sacred burial sites to build a 
border wall to neglecting the desperate 
situation of Native Tribes during the 
pandemic. Shame on them. 
In elevating Representative HAALAND 
to lead the Department of the Interior, 
we reset the relationship between the 
Federal Government and Tribal na-
tions to one of cooperation, mutual re-
spect, and trust, which is so different

March 15, 2021 
from the last administration’s atti-
tude. I greatly look forward to voting 
in favor of Representative HAALAND’s 
nomination in a few short hours. 
Throughout the week, the Senate 
will process even more of President 
Biden’s highly qualified Cabinet nomi-
nees, including Xavier Becerra to serve 
as the next Secretary of Health and 
Human Services; Isabella Guzman to 
serve as the SBA Administrator; and 
Katherine Tai to serve as the U.S. 
Trade Representative. 
As President Biden continues to fight 
the COVID pandemic and begins imple-
menting the American Rescue Plan, he 
deserves to have his team in place 
ASAP, as soon as possible. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now on the American Rescue Plan, late 
last week, President Biden signed the 
American Rescue Plan into law. The 
most significant Federal recovery ef-
fort in decades is now underway as 
$1,400 checks are heading out the door 
to 85 percent of American households. 
Relief for schools, businesses, families, 
and State and local governments is 
starting to arrive. Shots are going into 
the arms of Americans from coast to 
coast. More than 135 million doses of 
the vaccine have now been delivered, 
and over 100 million doses have now 
been administered. That is one-third of 
the population and much more quickly 
than had been previously projected. 
And our economy is poised for its 
own shot in the arm. As the American 
Rescue Plan begins to take effect, 
economists are projecting that Amer-
ican economic growth could more than 
double as a result of this bold, strong 
legislation. 
Already, Americans are more opti-
mistic about businesses being able to 
reopen, jobs coming back, and the na-
tional economy taking off. As one 
headline 
read 
over 
the 
weekend, 
‘‘Americans see better days ahead in 
pandemic and economy.’’ 
After the American Rescue Plan 
passed through the Senate, a little over 
a week ago, I have been highlighting 
parts of the bill that may have escaped 
notice, and there are so many. We all 
know about the $1,400 checks. We all 
know about the shots in the arm. But, 
today, I want to take some time ex-
plaining how it helps our Nation’s stu-
dents. 
First of all, the American Rescue 
Plan provides substantial emergency 
relief to colleges and universities, 
weighted toward those colleges and 
universities without million-dollar en-
dowments. Fully half of that funding 
must be used for emergency financial 
aid grants to students—at least $20 bil-
lion nationwide. And, of course, many 
students will benefit from the $1,400 
checks. Any student with a young fam-
ily will benefit from the historic ex-
pansion of the child tax credit. But 
these emergency financial aid grants 
are another way that students with ex-
ceptional need can access relief. 
That is not all. The American Rescue 
Plan also sets the stage for President 
Biden to deliver incredibly meaningful 
student loan forgiveness by making all 
types of student loan forgiveness tax 
free through December. 
At the moment, debt cancellation is 
usually treated as taxable income. So 
without this provision, forgiving a stu-
dent’s debt would stick them with a 
tax bill—giving with one hand and tak-
ing away with the other. This would 
apply to more than 100,000 students 
who are already in repayment pro-
grams that offer some student loan for-
giveness. Crucially, this tax provision 
would apply to future efforts to forgive 
student loans as well. 
I believe the current administration 
has the legal authority to forgive up to 
$50,000 in Federal student loan debt, a 
life-changing 
policy 
decision 
that 
would boost our economy and help 
close the racial wealth gap. 
Twenty years after starting college, 
the median White borrower will owe 6 
percent of their debt, while the median 
Black borrower owes 95 percent of their 
debt. Canceling up to $50,000 in student 
debt would close the racial wealth gap 
by 28 percentage points among those 
households. That is just one of the 
many reasons Senator WARREN and I 
have been advocating this policy to 
cancel $50,000 of student debt. And, as I 
mentioned, it has become an issue of 
racial justice as well. 
President Biden, to his credit, has al-
ready proposed some student loan for-
giveness—up to around $10,000. But 
now, one of the objections that some in 
the administration have had, that stu-
dents with forgiven debt will have to 
pay taxes, is gone, gone, gone because 
of the ARP. 
I particularly want to thank Sen-
ators MENENDEZ and WARREN for their 
work on these provisions. For much of 
American history, education has been 
the ladder up. For too many these 
days, student debt has become the an-
chor weighting them down, making it 
harder to start a family, buy a home, 
plan a career, and so much more. The 
pandemic has stressed student finances 
even closer to the breaking point. 
Thankfully, the American Rescue 
Plan not only delivers short-term relief 
but clears the way for long-term relief 
for American students by saying: When 
we forgive your debt, you don’t have to 
pay taxes on it. 
American students collectively bear 
more than $1.7 trillion in student debt. 
When you think of young people and 
they are starting out their lives, and 
there is so much excitement and enthu-
siasm, and then they have $1.7 trillion 
of debt on their shoulders weighting 
them down, that is not the American 
way of sunny optimism and can-do. 
This system sprung out of control in 
many ways. Going after the for-profit 
colleges, making sure they don’t take 
advantage, is one way we are trying to 
curtail it. But for the students who 
have this debt, future actions won’t do 
any good in terms of changing the way 
we finance colleges and how we deal 
with the for-profits. The best way is 
canceling $50,000 in student debt, and 
the good news is that the ARP makes 
sure no taxes are owed on any of that 
cancellation. 
So no matter how their team per-
forms 
during 
March 
Madness 
this 
weekend, the American Rescue Plan 
gives every student something to cheer 
about.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
last Thursday, I spoke about the pain 
and 
disruption 
this 
pandemic 
has 
caused this past year. I also discussed 
the optimistic springtime that lies be-
fore us. The brighter horizon is not a 
product of a partisan bill that was 
signed last week or an administration 
that was sworn in less than 2 months 
ago; it was built by the American peo-
ple and supported by the five historic 
and completely bipartisan bills that 
Congress passed just last year. 
Later on Thursday, the Nation heard 
remarks from President Biden. The 
President spoke in a heartfelt way 
about grief and loss, but his vision for 
the days ahead was badly lacking. 
Along a number of crucial dimensions, 
the Biden administration keeps trying 
to rewrite recent history and overrule 
science. 
Let’s take vaccinations. The Presi-
dent’s speech tried to reinforce the 
myth that his administration inherited 
a shambles on vaccines, set goals that 
nobody believed were achievable, and 
has met those goals against all odds. 
This is just not true. 
The President said: 
I set a goal that many of you said was . . . 
way over the top. 
But the benchmark of 100 million 
vaccines in 100 days was not some au-
dacious goal that was met with great 
skepticism. A million shots per day 
was just the pace that the Biden ad-
ministration actually inherited. We 
averaged more than 1 million shots per 
day the week of the inauguration. We 
totaled more than 1.5 million the day 
the President was sworn in. 
The groundwork we laid last year is 
proving a historic success. Where the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1511 
March 15, 2021 
Biden administration is continuing to 
help 
streamline 
distribution, 
they 
should, of course, get some credit, but 
their effort to sprint to the front of 
this yearlong campaign should not fool 
anybody. 
The President announced another 
supposedly audacious goal on Thurs-
day: that all adults in all 50 States 
should be eligible to schedule vaccina-
tions by May 1. Here is the problem: 
Dr. Fauci said a month ago we would 
be there by April. 
I would imagine by the time we get to 
April, that will be what I would call . . . 
‘’open season’’ . . . namely, virtually every-
body and anybody in any category could 
start to get vaccinated. 
That was Dr. Fauci’s prediction last 
month. So the President’s announce-
ment of May 1 wasn’t ambitious good 
news; it was actually a walk-back. 
Something tells me that if the last 
administration had contradicted Dr. 
Fauci and pushed the vaccine mile-
stone back a whole month, we might 
have heard about it from the media. 
Then there is the K–12 schooling. For 
months, science has confirmed that 
schools are remarkably safe and do not 
surge transmission of the virus. This 
administration’s own experts amplified 
this before liberal politics got in the 
way. 
In early February, President Biden’s 
CDC Director specifically said vacci-
nating the grownups who work in 
schools should not be a prerequisite for 
reopening them, but on Thursday, in-
stead of calling for schools to reopen 
right now, the President endorsed Big 
Labor’s moving goalposts. He said that 
because the Democrats passed their 
spending plan and because he has tried 
to move teachers toward the front of 
the 
line 
for 
vaccines, 
now—now— 
schools can move toward reopening. 
This approach has put liberal interest 
group politics ahead of vulnerable kids 
and their parents. 
It was reported last week that the 
following message was posted in a pri-
vate online group for members of one 
public school union in California. 
Friendly reminder: If you are planning any 
trips for Spring Break, please keep that off 
of social media. It is hard to argue that it is 
unsafe for in-person instruction if parents 
and the public see vacation photos and inter-
national travel. 
Further reports from California sug-
gest some local governments may con-
sider using some of the massive bail-
outs that Democrats sent them on bo-
nuses. Reportedly, one union argues 
that grownups should get bonuses for 
things like ‘‘an airplane trip to Hawaii 
when this is all over.’’ A lot of work-
ing-class families in the country are 
struggling through untenable situa-
tions—in large part thanks to the lib-
eral dogma that schools have needed 
lots more cash to become safe—and 
now unions are talking about trips to 
Hawaii? 
Every day that the Biden administra-
tion does not urge schools to reopen 
safely right now with simple pre-
cautions, it hurts kids who cannot af-
ford these moving goalposts. 
President Biden also made news with 
the big proclamation that maybe— 
maybe—if citizens behave themselves, 
we will be able to have small outdoor 
gatherings by July 4. He made sure to 
stipulate that politicians reserve the 
right to clamp down again, however, 
but that carrot dangled before Ameri-
cans was small outdoor gatherings 
about 4 months from now. This was bi-
zarre and problematic on several lev-
els. 
No. 1, let’s be clear: The Federal Gov-
ernment does not instruct free citizens 
how they may gather in small groups 
with their own families. I have advo-
cated strongly for following science, 
wearing masks, and taking all the pre-
cautions throughout this pandemic. 
The White House confers a bully pulpit. 
It does not confer supreme authority 
over daily life. 
Let’s not forget that about 10 months 
ago, many liberal politicians applauded 
massive outdoor gatherings because 
they supported a political cause. I am 
not sure how much capital these offi-
cials have to micromanage backyard 
barbecues. 
No. 2, this strange proclamation was 
out of step with science. Current CDC 
guidelines say it is already safe right 
now—right now—for fully vaccinated 
people to meet in small groups, not 
just outdoors but indoors, and they can 
be joined by an unvaccinated household 
if they are low risk. That is the CDC’s 
advice, talking not about July 4 but 
right now. Right now. 
So the President went on national 
TV to move the goalposts way beyond 
what his own CDC is saying. Why? 
There is no science-based reason why a 
few fully vaccinated people couldn’t 
get together outdoors right now—not 
July 4; today. And if a healthy young 
adult who is still waiting for the vac-
cine wants to meet up with a few vac-
cinated relatives, that is about a per-
sonal assessment of a very small risk, 
not a matter of Presidential policy. 
That brings me to point three. The 
President’s proclamation was far out of 
step with what is already happening 
across the country. It was advice for an 
alternate universe. The President and 
his advisers may need to get out more. 
Americans are already getting together 
in small groups outdoors in blue States 
and red States, in small towns and big 
cities. The country is not locked down 
waiting for July 4. 
In my home State of Kentucky, the 
Governor has backed indoor gatherings 
of up to eight people from up to two 
households. Here in the District of Co-
lumbia, as of next week, outdoor gath-
erings of up to 50 people will be per-
mitted—50 people here in the District. 
Americans are getting vaccines. They 
have learned about this disease. They 
have learned about the low risks of 
outdoor transmission. They are mak-
ing their own determinations as free 
people. 
Look, I have been a consistent advo-
cate for following the science, wearing 
a mask, and taking precautions. I be-
lieve we should all keep following the 
science. Nobody wants to fumble the 
ball on the 5-yard line. But that 
doesn’t mean just citizens; it means 
politicians too. And science doesn’t 
only run in the direction of more re-
strictions. 
The American people were told 12 
months ago that accepting major dis-
ruptions for a limited time would flat-
ten the curve and prevent a healthcare 
collapse, and Americans rose to the oc-
casion. 
One year on, if the President and his 
administration want to continue to 
give advice to free citizens, I suggest 
they exit the alternate universe, stick 
to the actual science, and get ac-
quainted with where the American peo-
ple actually are.

I was pleased to hear Senator CORNYN 
express support for Lisa Monaco. She is 
nominated to be the Deputy Attorney 
General. She has vast experience and 
deep ties to the Department. She has 
served in multiple roles as both a ca-
reer employee and a Senate-confirmed 
official. She is also someone who has 
predicted and responded to several of 
the greatest threats of our time, in-
cluding global pandemics and the rise 
of domestic terrorism. She has what it 
takes to serve as the No. 2 person in 
the Department of Justice and along 
with the Attorney General, Merrick 
Garland, to restore independence and 
integrity in that Department.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1512 
March 15, 2021 
Unfortunately, my friend from Texas 
went on to take a different view when 
it came to Vanita Gupta, who has been 
nominated to be an Associate Attorney 
General, the No. 3 position at the De-
partment. Every Senator, of course, 
has the right to oppose any nominee, 
even though many of my colleagues 
across the aisle have spoken about the 
importance of deferring to President 
Biden and his choices to lead his Cabi-
net. 
But when opposition turns from be-
yond 
just 
feeling 
negative 
toward 
someone to stating things about that 
person that may not be altogether ac-
curate, I feel obligated to come to the 
floor and correct the record. I would 
like to address a few of the false at-
tacks that are being leveled against 
Ms. Gupta. 
She unequivocally stated in her testi-
mony under oath before the Judiciary 
Committee last week that she opposes 
defunding the police. Any suggestion to 
the contrary is patently false. We have 
seen statement after statement from 
law enforcement organizations that 
support Vanita Gupta and her nomina-
tion. They admitted plainly that they 
know she doesn’t call for defunding the 
police. 
Yet we also continue to see state-
ment after statement from Republican 
Senators and many of their allies buy-
ing television ads claiming the con-
trary. Ask yourself this basic question: 
If Vanita Gupta wants to defund the 
police, how would she get the support 
and endorsement of the Fraternal 
Order of Police, the International Asso-
ciation of Chiefs of Police, Major Cities 
Chiefs Association, National Sheriffs’ 
Association, Federal Law Enforcement 
Officers Association, and others? I 
think we know the answer. She doesn’t 
want to defund the police. It is simply 
something that is said about her that 
is not true. 
But what Ms. Gupta has called for 
and what she reiterated before the 
Committee on the Judiciary last week 
is making sure that police officers, the 
men and women who put themselves in 
harm’s way every day, are not called 
upon to be mental health counselors. 
Some may have that skill, but most 
are not trained in that field, and it is 
not why they signed up for the job. 
As Ms. Gupta explained at her hear-
ing, we have spent far too long laying 
too many of our Nation’s social prob-
lems at the feet of police—no matter 
what goes wrong in the neighborhood, 
on the street, in the household—call 9– 
1–1. From homelessness to mental 
health issues to substance abuse dis-
orders, they all fall on the laps of our 
law 
enforcement 
officials. 
This 
is 
something that police officers, police 
chiefs, county sheriffs, and civil rights 
advocates agree on, finding the right 
person can be critical in an interven-
tion. 
Ms. Gupta is a consensus builder, and 
the consensus from law enforcement is 
this: Confirm Vanita Gupta. 
My friend from Texas also suggested 
there was something amiss in Ms. 
Gupta’s response to his question on 
whether she supported decriminalizing 
drugs. He asked her this at the hearing: 
‘‘Is it true that you advocate decrimi-
nalization of all drugs?’’ Ms. Gupta, 
under oath, responded: ‘‘No, Senator, I 
do not.’’ 
My friend from Texas suggested this 
answer was misleading, given that Ms. 
Gupta wrote 9 years ago that she would 
support decriminalizing the possession 
of small amounts of drugs. 
There was nothing misleading about 
her response. The question was posed 
in the present tense. It was not limited 
to decriminalizing possession. More 
importantly, as she eloquently ex-
plained at the hearing, Ms. Gupta’s po-
sition on decriminalizing drug posses-
sion had changed due to her family’s 
own experience with opioid addiction. 
She did something that far too few peo-
ple in Washington are willing to do. 
She 
acknowledged 
that 
she 
had 
changed her mind. 
I have done that, too, as an elected 
official. Sometimes people call me on 
it, and, luckily, I can turn to a good 
source for rebuttal. You see, Abraham 
Lincoln spent many years in politics, 
and he was once accused of changing 
his mind on an issue, and he replied: 
Yes, it is true, I changed my position 
on that issue, but I would rather be 
right some of the time than wrong all 
the time. That is the way I feel about 
being honest if you change your mind 
based on new information, new experi-
ence, or thinking it through from a dif-
ferent angle. 
My friend from Texas also suggested 
that Ms. Gupta somehow wanted to fol-
low her own personal convictions rath-
er than the law. That is not true. Ms. 
Gupta is a Justice Department veteran. 
She spent 3 years leading the Civil 
Rights Division. She enforced the law 
regardless of her personal views, and 
she will do the same as Associate At-
torney General. 
Senator CORNYN suggested that Ms. 
Gupta harbors personal views that are 
hostile to police. I won’t recount again 
all the police organizations that have 
endorsed her. But he omits the fact 
that she has already served in the Jus-
tice Department. And what was the 
verdict on her time in the Department? 
These police groups believe in her. 
They like her approach. They think she 
is fair. They have endorsed her. I hope 
my friends on the Republican side of 
the aisle will acknowledge that. 
Unlike 
the 
prior 
administration, 
President Biden has nominated senior 
Justice Department leaders who are 
driven by fidelity to the rule of law. 
They understand their role at the De-
partment as officials who enforce the 
law, and they will do so. Ms. Gupta is 
no exception. 
Next week, we will vote on Ms. 
Gupta’s nomination in committee. She 
has broad bipartisan support across the 
Nation—law enforcement, Justice De-
partment officials of both parties, civil 
rights groups, even some of the most 
conservative 
Republican 
advocates, 
they back Ms. Gupta. She deserves that 
same bipartisan support here in the 
Senate. 
FILIBUSTER 
Madam President, it was August of 
1957, and a Senator took the floor here 
in this very Chamber. He had a re-
markable record. He served as a Demo-
cratic Senator, as a Dixiecrat Senator, 
and as a Republican Senator before he 
finally retired, and he served many 
years. 
In 1957, he was on the floor of the 
Senate to take his last stand. It was 
August, and it was a confrontation he 
had been preparing for, for a long time. 
He was a veteran in World War II, one 
of the few in the Chamber at that time, 
and he was clearly a man devoted to 
his country and had shown real courage 
in serving as an officer in World War II. 
But his job on that day was to speak on 
the floor of the Senate for a long time. 
He had been preparing for it. He had 
taken daily steam baths trying to de-
hydrate his body so that he could stand 
on the Senate floor for a long time, 
even absorb fluids without needing to 
take a break to go the restroom. He ar-
rived for the battle armed with throat 
lozenges to stave off hoarseness, and he 
held the floor longer than any single 
Senator ever has, even to this day—24 
hours and 18 minutes. 
For what principled purpose did this 
Senator take such pains and prepara-
tion? For what noble reason did he 
grind the world’s greatest deliberative 
body to a full-scale halt for more than 
24 hours? In order to defend Jim Crow 
racial discrimination and deny equal-
ity to all Americans. 
Despite his efforts, the Senate would 
go on to pass the Civil Rights Act of 
1957, the first Federal civil rights law 
in nearly a century since the Recon-
struction. That Senator, of course, was 
Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. 
This is how he described the Civil 
Rights Act of 1957 during his now noto-
rious filibuster of that historic law. He 
said, ‘‘I think the bill which is under 
consideration is unconstitutional. I 
think it’s invalid. I think we are doing 
a useless thing.’’ 
Well, the truth was just the opposite. 
The blatant discrimination of Jim 
Crow laws was an affront to our Con-
stitution, a stain on our national char-
acter, and a threat to our standing in 
the world. The Civil Rights Act of 1957, 
which Strom Thurmond filibustered, 
broke the death grip of Jim Crow on 
American democracy and led the way, 
a few years later, to even more sweep-
ing equality laws, including the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. 
Today, nearly 65 years after Strom 
Thurmond’s marathon defense of Jim 
Crow, the filibuster is still making a 
mockery of American democracy. The 
filibuster is still being misused by 
some Senators to block legislation ur-
gently needed and supported by a 
strong majority of the American peo-
ple. 
There is one major difference, how-
ever, when it comes to filibusters from

March 15, 2021 
the days of Strom Thurmond and his 
long-winded defense of segregation. 
Strom Thurmond had to sacrifice per-
sonally his comfort for his misguided 
beliefs. He had to actually speak with-
out sitting on the floor for more than 
24 hours to maintain his filibuster. In 
his day, if you sat down to take a rest 
or left the floor, the filibuster was 
over. Today, it is not the same. Sen-
ators can literally phone in a fili-
buster. All a Senator has to do is to 
tell the staff working in the cloakroom 
what their intention is as to a fili-
buster, and then the message is deliv-
ered to the floor, and another bill is 
sent to the Senate’s overflowing legis-
lative graveyard. This is what hitting 
legislative rock bottom looks like. 
Today’s filibuster has turned the 
world’s most deliberative body into one 
of the world’s most ineffectual bodies. 
We are like the giant in ‘‘Gulliver’s 
Travels,’’ tied down by our own legisla-
tive redtape, unable to respond to cri-
ses and the clear wishes of the Amer-
ican people. 
Defenders of the filibuster will tell 
you that it is essential for American 
democracy. The opposite is true. To-
day’s filibuster undermines democracy. 
By eroding people’s faith in the abil-
ity of democracy to solve problems 
that matter the most, misuse of the fil-
ibuster may accidentally open the door 
to autocrats, would-be dictators, who 
falsely promise to deliver results, even 
if they ignore all of democracy’s rules. 
To my friends who count themselves 
as proud members and supporters of 
the Federalist Society—I am sure you 
have heard of it—go back and read the 
Federalist 
Papers. 
Read 
what 
the 
Founders thought of the filibusters. 
They hated the idea. Alexander Ham-
ilton and James Madison, both, penned 
passionate defenses of simple majority 
rule. Listen to what Alexander Ham-
ilton had to say about the super-
majority rule: ‘‘What at first sight may 
seem a remedy is, in reality, a poison.’’ 
Those are Hamilton’s own words. If a 
majority could not govern, Hamilton 
warned, it would lead to ‘‘tedious 
delays; continual negotiation and in-
trigue; 
[and] 
contemptible 
com-
promises of the public good.’’ ‘‘Tedious 
delays; continual negotiations and in-
trigue’’—sound familiar? 
And then there is James Madison, 
the father of the U.S. Constitution, in 
Federalist 58. He wrote that if a super-
majority were required to pass all new 
laws ‘‘the fundamental principle of free 
government 
would 
be 
reversed. 
It 
would be no longer the majority that 
would rule; the power would be trans-
ferred to the minority.’’ 
Hamilton, Madison, and other of our 
Founding Fathers debated and rejected 
the idea of supermajority rule. They 
protected minority rights by creating a 
government with a President, two leg-
islative Chambers, and a judiciary in 
which minority views were respected 
and making a law, even with simple 
majorities, was a challenge. 
Rather than protecting the finely 
balanced system our Founders created, 
today’s filibuster throws the system 
out of balance, giving one-half of one 
branch of government what amounts to 
veto over the rest of government. It 
promotes gridlock, not good govern-
ance. 
As I said, Senators don’t have to 
stand for even 1 minute to shut down 
the Senate. All they have to do is to 
threaten it, phone it in, catch a plane, 
go home from Washington, and come 
back Monday to see how their fili-
buster is doing. ‘‘Mr. SMITH Phones It 
In,’’ that wouldn’t have been much of a 
movie, would it? 
Defenders of today’s filibuster offer a 
second defense of the tradition. They 
say the filibuster promotes bipartisan 
cooperation and debate. Well, just look 
around. Can anyone really claim that 
we are living in the great age of Senate 
debate? Last year, calendar year 2020, 
in the entire year, 12 months, we con-
sidered 29 amendments on the floor of 
the Senate—29. It is quite an improve-
ment over the previous year, a 30-per-
cent improvement. The previous year 
we considered 22 amendments on the 
floor of the Senate. I am not counting 
the vote-arama spectacles. That is not 
much of a debate. It is not much of an 
amendment process. Sixty seconds a 
side, that is a great debate? Not by my 
definition. 
The truth is, as filibusters and 
threatened filibusters have increased 
in recent decades, real debate and bi-
partisan cooperation have plummeted. 
Today’s filibuster is often used to pre-
vent the Senate from even starting to 
debate important ideas. It is not the 
guarantor of democracy; it has become 
the death grip of democracy. 
Senator Thurmond’s 1957 filibuster 
marked only the fifth time since 1917 
that the Senate had voted to cut off 
any measure. I want you to reflect on 
that for a minute. We had had five fili-
busters in five decades when he took 
the floor in August of 1957. Guess what. 
We can have five filibusters in 5 days 
now; they have become so common. 
So how did the filibuster become a 
weapon of mass obstruction? The an-
swer is, we stumbled into it. The fili-
buster was a mistake to begin with, 
and it has gotten worse over time. As 
many of our colleagues know, when 
Congress first met in 1789, the House 
and the Senate rule books were nearly 
identical. Both rule books allowed a 
simple majority to cut off debate on 
any proposal by invoking what was 
known as the previous question rule. 
The House still has that motion. 
The Senate eliminated the previous 
question rule by mistake in 1805. The 
change came at the suggestion of Vice 
President Aaron Burr, who was fresh 
off of his trial for killing Alexander 
Hamilton, and who was later tried for 
treason. Burr, presiding over the Sen-
ate one day, skimmed the rule book 
and suggested the previous question 
rule be dropped. He reasoned, we hardly 
ever use that rule, so why is it nec-
essary? Thus, the filibuster was born, 
not as a sacred constitutional principle 
but an offhanded clerical suggestion. 
There were few filibusters before the 
Civil War. After the war, filibusters re-
mained rare, used exclusively to deny 
African Americans their basic con-
stitutional rights. The first major 
changes started in 1917. The Senate 
adopted what is known as rule XXII— 
the cloture rule—allowing the Senate 
to end debate with two-thirds majority 
vote. 
Fast-forward to the 1970s, two more 
changes in the filibuster. First, Sen-
ators changed the rule to allow more 
than one bill or matter to be pending 
on the Senate floor at a time. Before 
this, 
a 
filibuster 
really 
literally 
brought the Senate to a halt. The cre-
ation of this two-track system allowed 
the Senate to take up other matters 
while the filibuster continued, at least 
theoretically. 
In 1975, the rules were changed again, 
requiring just a three-fifths majority, 
60 votes—not 67 but 60 votes—to end a 
filibuster. Suddenly, the filibuster be-
came relatively painless, for Senators 
at least, and the number of filibusters 
exploded. 
From 1917 to 1970, the Senate took 49 
votes to break filibusters—49 votes in 
that period of 53 years. That is fewer 
than one a year. Since 2010, it has 
taken the Senate on average more than 
80 votes a year to end filibusters. 
Filibusters on so-called motions to 
proceed now regularly prevent us from 
even discussing proposals supported by 
the strong majority of American peo-
ple. The modern filibuster had broken 
the normal legislative process. It was 
never an essential or even intentional 
part of democracy, and now it rules the 
Senate. 
Over my last 20 years, I have faced a 
60-vote requirement to move a measure 
which is very important to me and to 
hundreds of thousands of people in our 
country. It is known as the Dream Act, 
the bipartisan Dream Act. It was intro-
duced so we could give to young people 
who were brought to this country as in-
fants, toddlers, and little kids by their 
families a chance to earn their way to 
a path of legalization and citizenship. 
Five times since it was first intro-
duced, the Dream Act has been stopped 
by a filibuster—twice in 2007, once in 
2010, twice in 2018. In each instance, the 
Dream Act received a bipartisan ma-
jority vote but was blocked by a minor-
ity of Senators. Their opposition pre-
vented the Senate from even debating 
the measure. 
It was repeated rejections to the 
Dream Act by a minority of Senators 
that finally moved President Obama to 
establish the Deferred Action for Child-
hood Arrivals, DACA. 
To our Republican colleagues, let me 
say this: If you don’t want to see this 
President or any President impose so-
lutions based on Executive orders, 
shouldn’t we be willing to debate the 
issues at hand and consider actually 
legislating? 
I have long been open to changing 
the Senate rules to restore the stand-
ing filibuster. If a Senator insists on

blocking the will of the Senate, he 
should at least pay the minimal price 
of being present, no more phoning it in. 
If your principles are that important, 
stand up for them, speak your mind, 
hold the floor, and show your resolve. 
Others have proposed different re-
forms, including reducing the number 
of votes needed to invoke cloture, cre-
ating a tiered system of voting in 
which a filibuster could be broken with 
successively smaller majorities and, ul-
timately, a simple majority. Some 
have suggested that we forbid filibus-
ters of bills that pass out of the com-
mittee with bipartisan support. I sup-
port discussing any proposal that ends 
the misuse of a filibuster as a weapon 
of mass obstruction. 
If the Senate retains the filibuster, 
we must change the rules so that any 
Senator who wants to bring the gov-
ernment to a standstill endures at 
least some discomfort in the process. 
We need new rules that actually pro-
mote debate. They are long overdue. 
I will close with one thought. My 
first job in the Senate was as a college 
intern for Illinois Senator Paul Doug-
las. Paul Douglas was an extraordinary 
man: Ph.D. in economics, war hero, 
champion of honest government, and a 
passionate supporter of civil rights. 
In 1957, he was actually on the floor 
when Strom Thurmond was giving his 
historic filibuster. In a bit of inge-
nuity, Paul Douglas asked that a pitch-
er of orange juice be placed on the desk 
next to Strom Thurmond’s desk. He 
hoped that thirst and the call of nature 
might force an end to the shameful fili-
buster. Well, it didn’t work. Likewise, 
it will take more than orange juice 
these days to bring an end to the fili-
buster as a weapon of mass obstruc-
tion. 
It is time to change the Senate rules. 
Stop holding the Senate hostage. We 
cannot allow misuse of arcane rules to 
block the will of the American people. 
I urge my colleagues to defend democ-
racy by making the changes needed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Alabama. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to discuss a piece of 
legislation we may soon consider in 
this body called H.R. 1. 
H.R. 1 does not solve the problems 
currently facing our election system; it 
makes the problems worse. Democrats 
have labeled the bill the ‘‘For the Peo-
ple Act,’’ but it really should be called 
‘‘For the Democrats Act.’’ 
This partisan bill represents the larg-
est Federal power grab in decades, and 
that is saying a lot after Democrats 
rammed through a partisan $1.9 trillion 
stimulus bill just 2 weeks ago. The 
American people elected 50 Republican 
Senators, but the Democrats are happy 
to cut out half the Chamber and the 
millions of Americans we represent to 
get what they want. 
H.R. 1 would completely rewrite our 
election laws, hijacking power from 
the States and giving it to the Federal 
Government to dictate how our elec-
tions are run. This type of top-down 
approach is the opposite of our found-
ing principles of self-government. 
Article I, section 4 of the Constitu-
tion grants States the authority to 
manage their Federal election proc-
esses; H.R. 1 would take that away. The 
changes to our free and Federal elec-
tions that H.R. 1 proposes should con-
cern every single American. This bill 
forces a one-size-fits-all election sys-
tem on our country by federally man-
dating how States run their elections. 
This phrase ‘‘for the people’’ means al-
lowing citizens to choose their own 
leaders and voting processes, not Wash-
ington dictating new rules of the game. 
Let’s look at a few examples. H.R. 1 
would prohibit States from requiring 
voters to show identification, photo ID, 
or otherwise. Currently, 36 States have 
requirements where voters need to 
show ID to vote. Nearly 75 percent of 
States agree that that is a good idea to 
confirm you are who you say you are 
when you go to exercise one of the 
most important civic duties. 
But the point is, States get to decide. 
They get to decide the laws on their 
books when it comes to managing their 
Federal 
election 
processes. 
H.R. 
1 
would nix the law in those 36 States. 
H.R. 1 would also make same-day 
voter registration mandatory in all 50 
States. There are obvious concerns 
with same-day registration and its po-
tential to be abused. This concept isn’t 
new. 
Many States have already had the 
opportunity to consider it and adopt it 
or not if they choose. But if H.R. 1 is 
enacted, it would overrule the laws and 
choices of 29 States that have already 
decided they don’t want such a risky 
provision in their voting process. 
Additionally, 
the 
Democrats 
are 
using this bill to make all the worst 
practices of pandemic-era elections 
mandatory in all 50 States: universal 
mail-in ballots, ballot harvesting, and 
the drop boxes, just to name a few. 
There may not be much we agree 
upon up here on Capitol Hill some-
times, but I think we all agree that the 
2020 Federal elections voting process 
was a complete disaster in some 
States. 
Many of the States that had the 
hardest time running their elections 
were the ones that adopted the same 
provisions in this bill. Normally, you 
seek to use best practices, but this bill 
adopts the worst practices and forces 
every State to use them. That is the 
opposite of how our ‘‘labs of democ-
racy,’’ our 50 States, should work. 
Every State is different, with dif-
ferent 
populations, 
histories, 
chal-
lenges, opportunities. What works for 
Alabama may not work for California 
or Oklahoma and vice versa. 
State governments know the needs of 
their people and communities better 
than bureaucrats here in Washington, 
DC. They have different laws, and they 
have different rules and regulations, 
including when it comes to voting. 
The same goes for the counties with-
in each State. Jefferson County, the 
most populous county in Alabama, is 
different from Greene County, the least 
populous. 
While the State sets broad param-
eters, county governments are given 
some flexibility to run elections in the 
way that is accountable and responsive 
to their people. H.R. 1 fails to recognize 
the difference in our States and coun-
ties. 
This bill is not for the people. It is 
not of the people or by the people. 
Americans want faith and trust in 
their elections. They want to feel con-
fident that the process works. H.R. 1 
injects distrust into the process, and 
that is not what Americans want or 
need. 
In H.R. 1, we have a bill that will 
make States’ voting procedures more 
susceptible to fraud. There is more we 
could go into, but I would say these 
provisions should be more than enough 
to sink this piece of legislation. 
It shouldn’t be controversial to say 
that we should have robust protections 
against voter fraud. Some States cer-
tainly do a better job protecting 
against fraud than others, but, ulti-
mately, that is up to the State to de-
cide, not the Federal Government. 
The Democrats’ repeated response is 
that election fraud doesn’t exist, but 
they only say this when it benefits 
them. They want to rewrite the rules 
of the game for all 50 States from Cap-
itol Hill. 
I have been consistent on the ques-
tion of voter fraud. I believe we need 
more integrity in our elections, not 
less. We as a country need to restore 
confidence in our electoral process. I 
have joined my colleagues in calling 
for a bipartisan commission to look 
into how we can make our elections 
more secure. But to completely throw 
away or outlaw many of the safeguards 
we have would destroy that remaining 
confidence for generations to come. 
But maybe that is the point of H.R. 1, 
which is even more reason to oppose 
this bad bill. 
House Democrats are calling this bill 
the most important voting legislation 
since the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
The Voting Rights Act was important, 
historic, and necessary. H.R. 1 is not. 
The Voting Rights Act guaranteed mil-
lions of Americans the rights granted 
by our Constitution that were wrong-
fully denied to them for too long. It 
was also passed with strong bipartisan 
majorities in both Chambers of Con-
gress, despite Democrats’ control of 
the Presidency, the House, and the 
Senate. 
That 
bipartisan 
support 
showed the American people that folks 
from different backgrounds can come 
together to work out important issues. 
Any reform to the rules of the game 
must be bipartisan, just like they were 
with the Voting Rights Act. For one 
party to completely rewrite the rules 
will destroy the people’s trust in our 
voting process and their trust in de-
mocracy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1515 
March 15, 2021 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Iowa. 
INFORMATION SHARING 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
today, I am going to discuss a very im-
portant issue that I started to inves-
tigate during the last Congress, and it 
is an issue that the executive branch 
must continue to improve upon. The 
subject is information sharing between 
the intelligence community and the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
The 
connection 
between 
those two entities is a critical informa-
tion sharing data point, and it must 
last beyond the current pandemic. 
To state the obvious, the healthcare 
landscape has evolved considerably in 
the past several decades. More specifi-
cally, the healthcare landscape has 
changed considerably in just the last 
year because of the COVID pandemic. 
Threats to healthcare now include 
cyber, intelligence, and counterintel-
ligence threats. 
For example, we know the Chinese 
Government engaged in cyber attacks 
to steal American COVID-related re-
search. The Communist Chinese Gov-
ernment will stop at nothing to steal 
our hard-earned work product. They 
know, as does the world, that the best 
of the best is still right here in Amer-
ica. 
Last Congress, as chairman of the Fi-
nance Committee, I focused a good deal 
of my oversight efforts on the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services’ 
Office of National Security. For exam-
ple, in June of 2019, I held a hearing on 
foreign threats to taxpayer-funded re-
search, where the Office of National 
Security was one of the government 
witnesses. After the hearing, I then 
held a classified committee briefing 
with all the government witnesses to 
further discuss the foreign threats that 
we face. 
That office is the Department’s con-
nection, then, to the intelligence com-
munity and, accordingly, it plays a 
critical role in the Department of 
HHS’s overall mission. That mission 
includes pandemic response and coun-
tering national security threats. 
To fully perform its function, HHS 
needs access to intelligence commu-
nity products and databases. So with 
that access, they would have informa-
tion that is vital to mitigating threats 
to the Department, its funded partners, 
and its interagency colleagues. So, as 
part of my oversight efforts and before 
the pandemic even started, I worked to 
get that process done. 
I noted my concerns to the Trump 
administration that the Office of Na-
tional Security hadn’t been adequately 
incorporated into the intelligence com-
munity. To their credit, the Trump ad-
ministration rightly and quickly re-
solved many of these issues. The 
Trump administration created links 
and information sharing between the 
intelligence community and the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices where that cooperation hadn’t ex-
isted before. 
Those links should have existed 
many years ago, but prior administra-
tions, like the Obama-Biden adminis-
tration, failed to see around the corner 
and get the job done. Just as an exam-
ple, even with the swine flu and out-
breaks across the globe, the Obama- 
Biden administration failed to plug the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services into the intelligence commu-
nity the way that it should have been 
done. The current pandemic exempli-
fies the need to have a robust intel-
ligence operation that includes the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices. 
As pathogenic threats to our home-
land and our people increase and be-
come more complex, the Federal Gov-
ernment must prepare well in advance 
for a very quick response. In order to 
accomplish that task, the government 
must focus on the seamless commu-
nication that must exist between and 
among the various Departments and 
Agencies. The Federal Government 
must take a whole-of-government ap-
proach. 
One serious barrier to that seamless 
communication is overclassification. 
That is a serious barrier we find too 
much in government. But, particularly 
when it deals with the pandemic, it be-
comes a problem that can cost a lot of 
lives. 
In January of 2020 when reports 
began to circulate about COVID, I in-
structed my oversight and investiga-
tive staff to get a classified briefing 
from the Office of National Security. 
After that briefing, I made clear in a 
public way that overclassification dur-
ing a public health emergency could 
have deadly consequences. 
If a certain intelligence work product 
is classified in a certain way, some-
times 
other 
government 
Agencies 
won’t then have access. The Federal 
Government must guard against this 
type of overclassification, and that is 
especially important during emergency 
situations that demand quick action. 
To the extent that disagreements 
exist between Agencies, which they 
often do in complex and ever-changing 
fact patterns, discussion must be had 
between and among the government. 
From that, the facts will bear out, and 
the best decisions can then be made. 
That process can’t take place if the 
government puts information in silos 
that Federal health Agencies are un-
able to access. 
Overclassification is more of a prob-
lem when China’s Government refuses 
to share relevant data with research-
ers. At least this government—the 
United States Government—can and 
should share information between and 
among its Agencies. 
This administration must advance 
and improve upon the cooperative 
gains created by the Trump adminis-
tration and make sure that the left 
hand continues to communicate with 
the right hand. The last thing that we 
should do is to revert to the lack of co-
operation that existed before, espe-
cially in light of the current pandemic 
and the lessons that have been learned 
from this pandemic. 
The cooperation between Federal 
health Agencies and the intelligence 
community will strengthen ties be-
tween them for decades to come, and 
the American people will be better 
served by the increased communica-
tion. Simply put, increased commu-
nication will save lives. 
SUNSHINE WEEK 
Now, Madam President, on another 
point, our democracy was built, as we 
all know, for the people, by the people, 
and, hence, is accountable to the peo-
ple. The best way to be accountable is 
through transparency. So I come to the 
floor today, like I have a lot of years at 
this time of the year, to celebrate an 
important week that we celebrate 
then, regularly, and it is known as 
Sunshine Week. 
During this week, we celebrate the 
birth of the fourth President of the 
United States, James Madison. Madi-
son, as we all know, was the father of 
the Constitution, and maybe we don’t 
know so much about him, but he also 
happens to be a father of the Constitu-
tion that believed in open government. 
He believed that access to information 
and meaningful oversight and account-
ability are foundational to the Amer-
ican system of government. In other 
words, the public’s business ought to be 
public. 
This year, I am continuing the Madi-
son 
legacy 
by 
introducing 
several 
pieces of legislation. I am also asking 
the Government Accountability Office 
to look into how the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act, or FOIA as we call it, has 
been impacted by the pandemic. 
First, on the judicial side of things, I 
am again advocating for cameras in the 
courts. In the last year, nearly every 
major institution, from schools to Con-
gress, have adapted to the pandemic by 
being virtual. So I believe bringing 
cameras into the Federal courtrooms 
would also bring in the public and open 
up access to our third branch of gov-
ernment. 
At the same time, I am also asking 
the courts to provide transparency into 
our civil justice system by requiring 
the disclosure of all parties in a case. 
Litigation 
funders, 
such 
as 
hedge 
funds, are providing money to plain-
tiffs to bring lawsuits. This is all done 
in secret. 
For many reasons, everyone involved 
in the case, including the judge and in-
cluding the defendant, should know 
that these parties funding these law-
suits exist—in other words, who they 
are. They are big players, or maybe 
you wouldn’t have those cases. 
On the executive side, one of the 
most important tools the public has to 
hold its government accountable is the 
Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. Be-
fore its passage, people had to justify 
their need for information to the gov-
ernment. 
Can you believe there was a time 
when, for the public’s business, which

ought to be public, you had to justify 
the need for information? So FOIA was 
passed. After that passage, the govern-
ment now has to justify its refusal to 
release information to you. 
In 2016, we took FOIA one step fur-
ther by requiring the government to 
proactively disclose information. These 
obligations are mandatory, even during 
unforeseen circumstances. I am deeply 
concerned that those obligations of 
that recent legislation are not being 
met. Even before the pandemic, the 
Government Accountability Office re-
ported a significant increase in the 
number of FOIA requests and a big 
backlog in addressing those requests. 
Last May, the Department of Justice 
reported that the coronavirus impacted 
FOIA processing governmentwide, as 
many agencies had limited ability to 
retrieve and process FOIA requests. 
That is why I am joining Senators 
DURBIN, LEAHY, and CORNYN in asking 
the GAO to examine FOIA processes 
and 
procedures 
in 
light 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Our hope is to continue refining 
FOIA to make government information 
accessible in good times and in bad. 
The public’s business should be public, 
maybe I should say except for national 
security reasons or privacy reasons. 
Many of you know I am an Iowa 
farmer. I know that without sunshine, 
there cannot be growth, and both corn 
and democracy thrive in the light. Re-
member, once again, this is Sunshine 
Week. Transparency brings account-
ability. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last 
Thursday night, I was able to return 
home to Texas, and on Friday, I went 
to the southern border. Texas has 100 
miles of common border with Mexico, 
and, obviously, we are at ground zero 
whenever there is a border crisis. 
I was glad to be joined by my friend 
Congressman HENRY CUELLAR, who has 
been a partner of mine on bipartisan, 
bicameral border security and immi-
gration reform legislation in the past, 
and we were also joined by Congress-
man MICHAEL BURGESS, our friend from 
North Texas. 
We visited a holding facility in 
Carrizo Springs, which houses young 
boys, ages 13 through 17, who were ap-
prehended along the border. We were 
able to see the facility, which includes 
medical care, classroom space, dining 
facilities, and legal services for these 
young men. And we heard from the 
Health and Human Services workers 
who are doing everything they can to 
care for these children, despite being 
completely overwhelmed. 
When we visited, there were 679 chil-
dren between the ages of 13 and 17, but 
the facility is expected to reach capac-
ity by today. This is no accident that 
we are seeing waves of unaccompanied 
minors coming across the border be-
cause the human smugglers and the 
drug traffickers understand our laws 
perhaps better than we do. And they 
know that if you are able to flood the 
zone with unaccompanied children, the 
Border Patrol are going to be dis-
tracted and diverted from their border 
security mission to take care of these 
children and to make sure that they 
are safe. 
In the meantime, the drug smugglers 
exploit those gaps left when the Border 
Patrol leaves the frontlines to handle 
and process these unaccompanied chil-
dren. Last year, more than 80,000 Amer-
icans died of drug overdoses in this 
country, and, unfortunately, a signifi-
cant percentage of that involves the 
methamphetamine, the fentanyl, the 
heroin, and the cocaine that comes up 
through the southern border in the 
hands of the same criminal organiza-
tions that move people, traffic in 
human beings, and, again, smuggle 
drugs. 
In the 2 months since President 
Biden took office, the situation along 
the border has come to rival the larg-
est surges that we have seen in pre-
vious years. We remember the border 
crisis of 2014, when an alarming num-
ber of unaccompanied children and 
families came across the southern bor-
der and completely overwhelmed the 
system. That summer, the situation 
was so dire that President Obama 
called it a humanitarian crisis. 
Then came the surge in 2019. That 
May, Customs and Border Protection 
reported a recordbreaking 144,000 en-
counters 
with 
migrants 
along 
the 
southwest border, more than double 
the amount we experienced during the 
2014 humanitarian crisis. 
So if 2014 was a humanitarian crisis, 
2019 was a humanitarian crisis on 
steroids. And I am afraid the current 
situation is going to get nothing but 
worse and perhaps outpace even the hu-
manitarian crisis on steroids that we 
saw in 2019. 
What makes this even more com-
plicated is, while this isn’t the first 
surge of migrants we have seen across 
the border, it is the first time we have 
seen it during a COVID–19 pandemic. 
And based on the current trend, this 
one is shaping up to be far worse than 
anything we have experienced in the 
past. 
Last month, Customs and Border 
Protection 
encountered 
more 
than 
100,000 individuals coming across the 
border, the highest number since 2006. 
Out of those 100,000 individuals last 
month, it included 9,000 unaccompanied 
children and 19,000 migrants coming 
across as families; that is, some com-
bination of a mother and father and 
minor children. 
Based on the sheer numbers, this is a 
problem. It is overwhelming the capac-
ity—physical capacity—to house and to 
take care of these children and to 
make sure that these individuals are 
processed according to the law. Border 
Patrol and Health and Human Services 
and our immigration courts do not 
have the capacity to manage an influx 
this large. 
And when you add the operational 
challenges and risks associated with 
the COVID–19 pandemic, it becomes 
even more difficult to house and care 
for these migrants, especially the chil-
dren. 
The facilities like Carrizo Springs 
were previously at a 40-percent capac-
ity to allow for social distancing— 
something we have heard a lot about in 
the last year—but the number of unac-
companied children has climbed so 
high that the Biden administration is 
now allowing those facilities to operate 
at 100-percent capacity, despite the ob-
vious risk of spreading COVID–19 be-
cause of a failure or inability to so-
cially distance. 
At one point last week, there were 
more than 3,700 children in the custody 
of the Border Patrol. By comparison, 
there were about 2,600 children in cus-
tody at the peak of the 2019 crisis. So 
the numbers are significantly higher. 
Reports over the weekend show that 
the number has increased to more than 
4,200, with nearly 3,000 held beyond the 
72-hour legal limit imposed by a court 
settlement. 
While these migrant children are 
without a doubt the biggest victims of 
this crisis, there are cascading con-
sequences. In Brownsville alone, more 
than 200 migrants were released from 
the Border Patrol’s custody, having 
tested positive for COVID–19—200 posi-
tive for COVID–19, ushered into the 
country. 
So despite the obvious health risks, 
many of these individuals continued 
their travels to their ultimate destina-
tions, both within and outside the 
State of Texas. Some traveled, we 
know, as far north as Maryland, North 
Carolina, and New Jersey. And this 
rapid-pace catch-and-release practice 
places a serious strain on the resources 
of our border communities. 
During the deadly winter storm last 
month, the mayor of Del Rio pleaded 
for the administration to stop releas-
ing migrants into the city and sur-
rounding area. The city’s capacities 
were 
already 
stretched 
thin. 
The 
mayor, Bruno Lozano, said: ‘‘We will be 
forced to make a decision to leave 
them without resources under these 
dire circumstances.’’ 
When the President’s Chief of Staff 
was asked recently about the border 
crisis in a recent interview, he said: 
‘‘We inherited a real mess.’’ 
Well, that is not the way I see it. The 
policies the administration inherited 
deterred the human smugglers, the 
coyotes, and cartels from even at-
tempting to smuggle children into the 
United States, particularly during the

COVID–19 pandemic. They required, 
under the Migrant Protection Pro-
gram, migrants to remain in Mexico 
while their asylum claims were being 
processed. 
Of course, the Biden administration 
has, in sort of a reflexive manner, re-
versed all of the previous administra-
tion’s policies without any plan to put 
in its place and without regard to the 
consequences. 
Well, the Migrant Protection Pro-
gram, which was negotiated with the 
government of Mexico, worked pretty 
well. It allowed border communities to 
know that they wouldn’t have to bear 
the brunt of thousands of migrants 
coming across the border into their 
communities 
while 
simultaneously 
battling a pandemic. 
The Biden administration didn’t in-
herit this mess; it helped create it. 
President Biden campaigned on the 
basis of policies that would lead to this 
very outcome. 
One woman who crossed the Rio 
Grande on a smuggler’s raft said the 
Biden administration is the reason she 
and her 1-year-old son attempted the 
journey at all. She said: ‘‘That gave us 
the opportunity to come.’’ And come 
they did. 
Whether you call this a mess, as the 
President’s Chief of Staff did, or a 
human challenge, as the Secretary of 
Homeland Security did, I can tell you 
one thing: Unless the Biden adminis-
tration reverses course, it will only get 
worse. We usually see the peak num-
bers of migration happen during the 
springtime and in the early summer, 
frankly, because of the weather and the 
ease of passage. So we haven’t seen 
nothing yet compared to what we will 
see unless action is taken. 
During my visit last Friday, one of 
the people involved in the operation of 
the Carrizo Springs facility said: This 
is a category 5 hurricane with tropical 
storm force winds on the coast. It is 
coming. 
Well, we have seen this before, as I 
said—many times, in fact. And unless 
action is taken to stem the flow of mi-
grants across the border, that category 
5 hurricane is going to break the entire 
system. 
In my time in the Senate, I have al-
ways looked to the men and women on 
the ground—the Border Patrol who 
wear green uniforms, the Customs and 
Border Protection officials who wear 
blue uniforms. I have looked to them 
to learn more about how things are 
going and how Congress and other pol-
icymakers can provide support. 
As I said, we share a 1,200-mile border 
with Mexico, and our border commu-
nities are made up of incredible net-
works of law enforcement, local lead-
ers, and nongovernmental organiza-
tions that work together to help keep 
the migrants safe, as well as commu-
nities safe. Many of them are moti-
vated solely by their humanitarian im-
pulses, and we couldn’t do as well as we 
are doing without them. 
One frustration I have heard in re-
cent weeks is over vaccine distribution 
for Border Patrol and other Federal of-
ficers who have no choice but to come 
in contact with COVID–19-positive mi-
grants coming across the border. These 
men and women—Federal employees, 
Federal law enforcement officers—are 
at 
significant 
risk 
of 
contracting 
COVID–19 because of their work with 
detained and vulnerable populations. 
We know that more than 8,000 Cus-
toms and Border Protection employees 
have tested positive for COVID–19, and 
27 have died since the start of the pan-
demic. More than 2,800 of these 8,000 
cases have been in my State of Texas. 
But despite this knowledge, the admin-
istration has not made vaccinating 
these men and women on the frontline 
a priority. 
Last week, Senator SINEMA of Ari-
zona and I sent a letter to Secretary 
Mayorkas to advocate for Border Pa-
trol and the Department of Homeland 
Security’s other Federal law enforce-
ment officers to be prioritized for vac-
cination. I am glad to announce that 
the administration responded by open-
ing a vaccination clinic in the Rio 
Grande Valley, which is a great first 
step, but law enforcement across the 
entire border deserve to be vaccinated 
as soon as possible. If the administra-
tion is going to implement policies 
that create even more dangers to these 
frontline officers and agents, the very 
least they can do is offer them protec-
tion from COVID–19. 
After visiting the Carrizo Springs fa-
cility, Congressman CUELLAR
and I 
traveled to Laredo, TX, where we met 
with a group of mayors, county judges, 
and a range of community leaders for a 
discussion on the ways this crisis is im-
pacting them. 
We discussed the bungled mess of the 
immigration courts, which have a 
backlog of 1.2 million cases. In fact, the 
human smugglers and drug cartels 
know that because of our laws and our 
failure to offer consequences associated 
with illegal entry into the United 
States, that we will never get to those 
1.2 million backlog cases and that peo-
ple can simply evade the law by refus-
ing to show up for their court-ap-
pointed date. 
Well, we talked about how the big-
gest beneficiaries of the crisis weren’t 
the migrants crossing the border but, 
rather, the transnational criminal or-
ganizations—the cartels, the human 
smugglers, and the coyotes who bring 
them here. Border Patrol told me that 
the average smuggling fee for cartels 
to bring a single unaccompanied child 
into the Del Rio Sector was more than 
$7,300—$7,300 per child. The Chief of the 
Border Patrol sector there in Del Rio 
told me that just this year, they have 
detained people from 54 separate coun-
tries—54 separate countries—coming 
through the Del Rio Sector of the Bor-
der Patrol. So this is like the United 
Nations coming across our border, and, 
frankly, it is such a financially reward-
ing business for the human smugglers 
and the criminal networks, they will 
literally bring people from anywhere 
around the world across our southern 
border into the United States. That 
ought to concern all of us. 
Well, the Border Patrol is mounting 
a struggle against the border crisis and 
the pandemic simultaneously. Like cit-
ies across the country, our border com-
munities have already had a very dif-
ficult year battling COVID–19. They 
had to cover a range of expenses cre-
ated by the pandemic in order to keep 
their communities safe and healthy. 
But, unlike other communities across 
the country, they had the added eco-
nomic hardship created by nearly a 
year of legal limits on nonessential 
cross-border travel. 
Prepandemic, visitors from Mexico 
would travel across the border to shop, 
eat at restaurants, and visit their fam-
ily members. They were a huge eco-
nomic driver in our border commu-
nities from El Paso all the way down 
the Rio Grande to the Rio Grande Val-
ley. But the ‘‘pause’’ on legitimate 
nonessential travel has created a seri-
ous economic strain on these commu-
nities, and those leaders are struggling 
to understand the disconnect between 
the Biden administration’s two dif-
ferent approaches. 
One of the participants at the round-
table said: ‘‘I don’t understand how you 
can catch-and-release and not let our 
neighbors across the border come over 
and spend money in our communities 
to help [grow] our economy.’’ 
This confluence of crises is a one-two 
punch for our border communities, and 
it is unfair that they are expected to 
carry the burden of a crisis that should 
be the responsibility—is the responsi-
bility of the Federal Government. 
In many cases, nongovernmental or-
ganizations carry a significant amount 
of weight that, quite frankly, is un-
fairly placed on their shoulders. Con-
gressman CUELLAR and I were joined in 
Laredo with three incredible NGOs 
whose resources are already stretched 
thin because of the pandemic and have 
managed to take on a substantial 
amount of work in managing this hu-
manitarian crisis. 
I want to commend Catholic Char-
ities of Laredo, the Sisters of Mercy, 
the Holding Institute Community Cen-
ter, and other NGOs along the Texas 
border for everything they have done 
to respond to the humanitarian crisis. 
I encourage anyone who is interested 
in understanding the crises and work-
ing to find solutions, including Presi-
dent Biden, to visit our border and to 
hear from these same individuals first-
hand. 
No matter what party controls the 
Senate, the House, or the White House, 
these law enforcement, local leaders, 
and NGOs are doing everything they 
can to keep both migrants and their 
communities safe. They are currently 
overwhelmed, frustrated, and eager for 
change, and their voices must be heard. 
We are at an inflection point in the 
humanitarian crisis, and unless the ad-
ministration acts and acts quickly, we 
are headed down a very dangerous

path. We have seen enough of these 
surges in the past to know what to ex-
pect. 
If you are opposed to human traf-
ficking, human suffering, drug smug-
gling, pushing migrants into the shad-
ows, then you should be absolutely 
alarmed by what is happening along 
the border today. 
The hurricane is on the way. I hope 
the administration and Congress will 
take a serious interest in acting before 
it makes landfall. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
NOMINATION OF DEBRA ANNE HAALAND 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am here to say a few words on 
behalf of DEB HAALAND to be Secretary 
of the Interior. 
There is something wonderfully beau-
tiful and symmetrical about her ap-
pointment to this position because of 
the Department of the Interior’s role 
supervising America’s public lands. 
Well, of course, before America’s public 
lands were America’s public lands, they 
were Native American lands, and DEB 
HAALAND will be the first Native Amer-
ican to serve in any President’s Cabi-
net and the first to serve as the Sec-
retary of this Department. So that is 
kind of a wonderful harmony with his-
tory, and I hope we appreciate that 
here. 
The second thing that I want to say 
is that it is, to me, deeply ironic how 
much of the opposition to her as Sec-
retary has come on the theory that she 
won’t be fair to fossil fuels. We have 
lived through 4 years of a Trump ad-
ministration with Secretaries of the 
Interior 
who 
were 
out-and-out 
operatives of fossil fuel. The fossil fuel 
hand in the Secretary’s glove was obvi-
ous. 
The idea that anything other than 
fossil fuel was treated fairly in the 
Trump administration is a prepos-
terous notion. Basically, anything that 
wasn’t nailed down, they gave to the 
fossil fuel industry with no consider-
ation for any of the competitors, and 
they did it so badly and so shabbily and 
so sloppily because they were so greedy 
that a lot of the stuff they did got 
thrown out by courts because they 
didn’t even bother to do their home-
work. 
So, please, let’s not talk about fair-
ness after the last 4 years. Our friends 
on the other side lost their standing to 
talk about fairness after what they did 
for fossil fuel in the last 4 years, in-
cluding outright lies about climate 
change. 
My good friend from Texas talks 
about hurricanes. He has real hurri-
canes 
coming 
because 
of 
climate 
change. Yet where is the climate plan 
from the other side? None, because the 
fossil fuel industry won’t let them. 
Let me last say as I conclude, I come 
from the Ocean State. Representative 
HAALAND comes from one of those inte-
rior square States. Her Agency is 
called the Department of the Interior. 
When you look at things like the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, floods of 
money go to inside America, interior 
America, upland and inland America, 
and the coasts always get overlooked. I 
have 
made 
it 
very 
clear 
to 
Ms. 
HAALAND that has to stop. With cli-
mate change coming, with fisheries 
moving about, with sea levels rising, 
with oceans warming, with actual seas 
acidifying in front of our eyes, to over-
look the coast can happen no more. I 
trusted her when she said she would. I 
will take her at her word, but I also in-
tend to work very hard to make sure 
that I can support her in keeping her 
word that oceans and coasts will mat-
ter. 
I yield to my friend from Minnesota. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. SMITH. Madam President, I rise 
today in strong support of the historic 
nomination of DEB HAALAND to serve as 
Secretary of the Interior. When Rep-
resentative HAALAND appeared before 
the Senate for her confirmation hear-
ing, she opened by saying: ‘‘My story is 
unique.’’ 
HAALAND
is a 35th-generation New 
Mexican, an enrolled member of the 
Laguna Pueblo, and will be the first- 
ever Native American to serve as a 
Cabinet Secretary. 
National Congress of the American 
Indians President Fawn Sharp noted 
that it is fitting that as we celebrate 
Women’s History Month, DEB HAALAND 
is poised to make it. Her nomination is 
a historic choice and a moment of deep 
meaning to Tribal nations and indige-
nous people across the country who 
have seen over and over again the Fed-
eral Government fail to keep its prom-
ises to Native people, promises made in 
law and treaty. 
It is clear to me that we need Rep-
resentative HAALAND’s strong voice of 
stewardship for our public resources, 
cultural resources, and public lands, 
for action on the climate crisis, and for 
making sure that the Federal Govern-
ment lives up to its treaty and trust 
responsibilities for Tribal nations and 
their citizens. 
Representative 
HAALAND’s 
back-
ground and her life experiences make 
her perfect for this job. As HAALAND 
said during her confirmation hearings, 
‘‘If an Indigenous woman from humble 
beginnings can be confirmed as Sec-
retary of the Interior, our country 
holds promise for everyone.’’ 
The Interior Department includes the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs, which man-
ages the Federal Government’s rela-
tionship with American Indian, Alaska 
Native, and Native Hawaiian commu-
nities. Indigenous leaders across the 
country have expressed broad, bipar-
tisan 
support 
for 
Representative 
HAALAND’s nomination because they 
know that she will bring a personal 
commitment 
to 
lifting 
up 
Native 
voices and addressing deep inequities 
and longstanding funding challenges on 
Tribal lands. 
The Department is also responsible 
for public lands, energy resources, and 
wildlife conservation, and so it requires 
a leader who understands the cultural 
and economic value of these resources 
and 
the 
importance 
of 
conserving 
them. Representative HAALAND grew up 
with a deep affinity for public lands, 
for responsible land use, and for hunt-
ing and fishing. In fact, her family on 
her father’s side is from Minnesota, 
where she tells me she learned a lot 
about the joys of walleye fishing. 
In 
the 
House, 
Representative 
HAALAND served as the chair of the 
Subcommittee on National Parks, For-
ests, and Public Lands, and she has 
earned the support of hundreds of 
groups working on climate change, 
conservation, and public lands manage-
ment. 
Representative HAALAND has been a 
champion for the tragic crisis of miss-
ing and murdered indigenous women. 
Here we have a strong, capable, com-
petent leader ready to serve our coun-
try as the first Native woman to lead 
the Interior Department. Colleagues, I 
can’t help asking here during Women’s 
History Month, why is it that almost 2 
months after President Biden’s inau-
guration, Representative HAALAND
is 
one of the last three core Cabinet mem-
bers to be confirmed in the Senate? 
Why is it that she has faced such fe-
rocious opposition from some Repub-
licans? 
Colleagues, over the last 3 months, 
Representative 
HAALAND
has 
been 
called ‘‘extreme’’ and ‘‘radical.’’ 
One Republican Senator I serve with 
on the Indian Affairs Committee la-
beled HAALAND a ‘‘hardline ideologue 
with radical views’’—this from a person 
who spent months promoting the false 
and widely debunked conspiracy theo-
ries about voter fraud in our election. 
Another Republican Senator called 
Representative HAALAND a ‘‘socialist, 
left-of-Lenin 
whack 
job’’—though, 
later, he said he merely meant to call 
her an ‘‘extremist.’’ 
In the House, a Member of my own 
Minnesota congressional delegation or-
chestrated a hit campaign on Rep-
resentative HAALAND by attacking her 
position on natural resources manage-
ment and boundary waters. Strangely, 
this same Member happily supported 
Secretary Vilsack’s confirmation even 
though he holds exactly the same posi-
tions. 
As our former colleagues Tom Udall 
and Mark Udall said in an op-ed in USA 
Today, it is hard to imagine that either 
of them, had they been nominated to 
lead Interior, would have faced the 
same attacks for radical ideas. 
I just find it difficult to take these 
Republican attacks at face value. My 
colleagues should know that Rep-
resentative HAALAND was named the 
most bipartisan House freshman in the 
last Congress. If that is what a 
hardline ideologue looks like, maybe 
we should all aspire to be the role 
model that DEB HAALAND provides. 
Colleagues, I think we need to be 
honest with ourselves about what is 
going on here. Once again, a woman—

March 15, 2021 
and a woman of color—is being held to 
a different standard, and we need to 
name it. We have to come to grips with 
the reality that, time after time, 
strong women, especially women of 
color, are attacked when White men 
with the same views are welcome to 
walk right through that door, unop-
posed. 
At their worst, these efforts—these 
attempts—to portray Representative 
HAALAND as extreme and unqualified 
show how much work we still have to 
do to reckon with our country’s history 
of disparaging, disrespecting, and eras-
ing Native people and how this tragic 
history has been reflected in the biases 
on 
exhibit 
during 
Representative 
HAALAND’s confirmation. This is clear 
when we see how few Republicans could 
even acknowledge the historic nature 
of Representative HAALAND’s nomina-
tion, choosing, instead, to focus on hos-
tile questions about her tweets and 
whether she understands the law. 
Now, sadly, these attacks that Rep-
resentative HAALAND
has been sub-
jected to are not unique. We have seen 
this dance play out time and again 
with Biden-Harris nominees, especially 
with women of color. Excellent nomi-
nees, like Secretary Vilsack and Sec-
retary Buttigieg, faced relatively tame 
confirmation processes. The vast ma-
jority of questions were about policy 
goals and their experience. No Senator 
referred to these nominees as ‘‘extrem-
ists’’ or ‘‘radicals.’’ 
Yet how did the women of color fare? 
In the Banking Committee, my Re-
publican colleagues grilled Secretary 
FUDGE, our new Secretary of Housing 
and Urban Development—and a Black 
woman—about her intemperate com-
ments on race. This was less than 3 
weeks after our former President in-
cited an insurrection of White su-
premacists, among others, and faced 
essentially no consequence from his 
own party. Neera Tanden was forced to 
withdraw her nomination to lead the 
Office of Management and Budget after 
some declared that her Twitter ac-
count was too divisive. 
Well, if we had only known that 
mean tweets could disqualify you from 
public office, we could have saved our-
selves 4 years of division and chaos and 
two impeachment trials after a torrent 
of inflammatory and hateful rhetoric 
from the former Twitter account of our 
former President, which most of my 
Republican colleagues said they tried 
to ignore or just hadn’t read. Strong 
opinions from strong women of color 
are deemed unacceptable and cause for 
disqualification. I am just not buying 
it. 
In my first floor speech in this Cham-
ber, I said that, when you really listen 
to women, you begin to understand all 
the ways in which women are made less 
and are denied opportunities to con-
tribute to their communities and to 
their country. 
So I urge my colleagues: Don’t let 
this be one of those times. Let’s not si-
lence these women and deny them op-
portunities to lead because we are un-
comfortable with their power. 
During 
Representative 
HAALAND’s 
confirmation process, I started to get 
text messages from women friends, es-
pecially from Native women, who were 
horrified by the yelling and the conde-
scending questions that were directed 
her way. We were proud of how she re-
sponded—with grace and with dignity— 
and we all knew how it felt. 
I would bet that every woman in this 
Chamber knows what it feels like when 
this happens. A man talks down to you. 
He uses his power to explain something 
that you already know and signals in a 
hundred different ways that you don’t 
belong in the room where it happens. 
Well, for a long time, women have 
found ways to respond to these affronts 
with 
grace 
as 
did 
Representative 
HAALAND, 
MARCIA
FUDGE, 
Vanita 
Gupta, and Neera Tanden. 
When I was a young woman, my 
mother was a very strong woman her-
self. She used to advise me to just ig-
nore these folks and go about my busi-
ness. Even today, as I worked on this 
floor speech, I wondered: Am I going to 
offend anybody? Am I going to sound 
too shrill? I bet there is not a man in 
this room who has ever worried about 
sounding too shrill. 
So, colleagues, tonight, we will vote 
on Representative DEB HAALAND’s con-
firmation to Secretary of the Interior, 
and we will all have a chance to restore 
dedicated, capable, passionate leader-
ship to this important Department. 
The choice to confirm Representative 
HAALAND is, indeed, historic, but it is 
not an abstract opportunity. As Sec-
retary, Representative HAALAND
will 
play a consequential role in combating 
climate change. She will also honor 
Tribal sovereignty and strengthen the 
government’s relationship between the 
United States and Tribal nations. 
Maybe, just maybe, her leadership will 
help us see the strength of Native 
women and of all women and to not be 
threatened by that. Our country will be 
the better for it. I urge my colleagues 
to support the confirmation of DEB 
HAALAND for Secretary of the Interior. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
MAIDEN SPEECH 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, on 
behalf of the people of California, it is 
my honor to address this body today. I 
stand before you, humbled and inspired 
by this moment in our Nation’s his-
tory, as the Senator from the most 
populous and most diverse State in the 
Nation and as the first Latino Senator 
from the State of California. Let me 
begin by saying what a great country 
this is. 
My name is ALEX PADILLA. 
(English translation of statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
I am the son of Santos and Lupe 
Padilla. 
I am also the proud husband of An-
gela Padilla and the proud rad dad of 
Roman, Alex, and Diego. 
I love you guys. 
Colleagues, my family’s journey is 
central to my public service. My par-
ents immigrated to California from 
Mexico in the 1960s in search of a bet-
ter life. They arrived from different re-
gions of Mexico, with little formal edu-
cation but with a tremendous work 
ethic and big dreams. They met in Los 
Angeles. They fell in love. They de-
cided to get married and apply for 
green cards—in that order. 
I thank the U.S. Government every 
day for saying yes to those applica-
tions, because, if they had been denied, 
no doubt my life story would be a lot 
different. 
For 40 years, my father worked as a 
short order cook—hard work, honest 
work—and as he will proudly tell you, 
his kitchen never failed an inspection. 
For the same 40 years, my mom worked 
tirelessly cleaning houses. It seemed 
like she never had a day off, but, to-
gether, they raised three of us—my sis-
ter, my brother, and me—in a modest, 
three-bedroom home in the proud, 
working-class community of Pacoima, 
CA, in the northeast San Fernando 
Valley. 
Now, our neighborhood had more 
than its share of challenges—from pov-
erty to crime to unhealthy air. It 
might not have been the safest neigh-
borhood, but my mom felt blessed that 
we had the sanctuary of a backyard 
and a strong sense of community. It 
was there that my parents taught us 
about the values of service to others 
and of getting a good education. 
Today, my sister, my brother, and I 
are all public servants. My sister has 
been a teacher, a principal, and, today, 
she works in administration for the 
Los Angeles Unified School District. 
My brother serves as chief of staff to 
Los Angeles City Council President 
Nury Martinez. If you pay close atten-
tion there, yes, I am the middle child. 
It may explain a lot. 
Think about that. In one generation, 
our family has gone from being immi-
grant cooks and house cleaners to serv-
ing in the U.S. Senate. That is the 
California dream. That is the American 
dream. That is the dream I was raised 
to believe in and the dream that An-
gela and I are working hard to keep 
alive for our children and for future 
generations. 
I think about my parents often, and I 
think about all of the hard-working 
people in our State and in our Nation 
who are hurting right now. I rise today 
on their behalf. 
I rise on behalf of the cooks, the dish-
washers, and the domestic workers who 
have seen their jobs and their lives up-
ended by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I rise on behalf of the farmworkers 
and delivery drivers and nurses who 
have been on the frontlines of this pan-
demic and who have never stopped 
showing up. 
I rise on behalf of the 4 million small 
businesses in California and the busi-
ness owners, many who are hanging on 
by a thread and stretching like they

March 15, 2021 
have never stretched before to meet 
payroll. 
I rise on behalf of the nearly 2.5 mil-
lion California families who are behind 
on their rent or behind on their mort-
gages, with bills piling up, wondering 
how they will ever climb out of the 
hole. 
I rise on behalf of the 11.2 million 
California adults who struggled to 
meet basic household expenses last 
year, including many who relied on 
food pantries just to get by. 
I rise on behalf of the 56,000 Cali-
fornia families and the more than 
530,000 families across America who 
have lost a loved one, many who died 
alone in a hospital room or a nursing 
home, deprived of the last chance to 
hold hands or say goodbye. 
The people of my State are hurting; 
the people of our country are hurting, 
and we have a long way to go before we 
get back. The greatest crisis of our life-
times demands bold action. ‘‘Building 
back better’’ demands that we build 
back better for everybody and that we 
leave nobody and no community be-
hind. To do so requires that we open 
our eyes to the deep, systemic inequi-
ties that have been exposed and exacer-
bated by this crisis. 
In my State, the reality is that there 
are two Californias just as there are 
really two Americas—one for families 
who struggle to pay the rent and make 
ends meet, who struggle to keep hope 
alive, and one for those who can afford 
to work from home or from a second 
home, who can more easily weather 
this storm. 
We see two Californias where Latino, 
Black, and Asian households are three 
times as likely to be behind on the 
rent. It is the story of the single mom 
who lost her job due to the pandemic 
and who has depleted her entire sav-
ings to keep a roof over her family’s 
head. 
We see two Californias where em-
ployment has actually increased for 
people earning more than $60,000 a year 
while some parents are left to make 
the impossible choice of either paying 
for food or paying their utility bills so 
their kids can still log into online 
class. 
We see two Californias, where the 
stock market reaches new highs for 
some, while in the San Fernando Val-
ley, too many families depend on city 
or church food distribution sites to 
feed their children. 
We see two Californias, where there 
is a stark disparity in who is getting 
vaccinated and who is not. 
Just take, for example, the city of 
Beverly Hills, where more than 25 per-
cent of residents have received their 
first shot. That is a good thing. What is 
not so good is that in South LA, less 
than 15 miles away, the rate is just 5 
percent. 
And we see two Californias in the im-
pact the pandemic has had on immi-
grant communities—communities on 
the very frontlines of this crisis. 
I recently announced my first bill, 
the Citizenship for Essential Workers 
Act, which would provide a well-earned 
pathway to citizenship for undocu-
mented immigrants who have risked 
their 
health 
as 
essential 
workers. 
These are the workers whom we have 
all depended on during this pandemic. 
Now, millions of us have offered tre-
mendous gestures and thanks for their 
heroism and their hard work. Let’s be 
honest with ourselves. Many of these 
workers woke up before dawn today 
and took a bus to work so that others 
could ‘‘Zoom to work’’ from the com-
fort of their own homes. 
These essential workers take care of 
our loved ones. They keep the supply 
chain moving. They grow and harvest 
our food, stock the shelves at grocery 
stores, and will even deliver it to your 
door. They risk their lives so that oth-
ers can stay safer at home. 
We cannot, in good conscience, praise 
them as essential workers in one 
breath while denying them the essen-
tial human dignity they deserve with 
the next. 
Yes, dignity, respect, and a pathway 
to citizenship for essential workers is 
personal to me, but it is also in the 
best interest of our Nation. 
These immigrants are paying more 
than their fair share. They are deemed 
essential by the Federal Government 
for good reason, and they have earned 
the rights and responsibilities of citi-
zenship. We cannot allow the American 
Dream to be a casualty of this pan-
demic. Relief and recovery must be for 
everyone. 
Now, the American Rescue Plan that 
this body passed and President Biden 
just signed into law is a $1.9 trillion 
downpayment on this promise. It will 
speed vaccination production and dis-
tribution, expand testing and contact 
tracing, outfit our schools so kids and 
teachers can safely return to the class-
room, provide emergency mortgage and 
rental assistance to families in need, 
and it will extend a lifeline to keep 
millions of American small businesses 
from going under. 
Now, I will tell you what it means for 
my home State. In addition to what 
this bill will deliver to fight the virus, 
it also means immediate food assist-
ance for 4.3 million families, an in-
crease in the standard of living for 8 
million California children, $15 billion 
for California schools, $590 million to 
help 
combat 
homelessness 
on 
the 
streets of California, and billions in di-
rect checks for struggling families. 
The American Rescue Plan provides a 
lifeline for American families, workers, 
and businesses to survive what we all 
hope will be the last months of this cri-
sis. 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
trans-
formational and progressive pieces of 
legislation in our history, which will 
cut child poverty in half, including for 
half a million children in California. 
But our work is far from over. I be-
lieve now is the time to lead an Amer-
ican comeback that leaves no working 
family behind—a comeback that heals 
the longstanding divides in our society 
and unites our country, a comeback 
that confronts the systemic injustices 
in our country so that we can build 
back equitably. 
It took almost 10 years to recover 
from the great recession. We lived 
through the consequences of the mod-
erate response to the financial crisis— 
slow growth, poor pay, and millions 
without jobs. We cannot let that hap-
pen again. We can and must build back 
better. 
That means investing trillions in our 
infrastructure in a way that uplifts 
communities and provides millions of 
good-paying union jobs and in a way 
that addresses our climate crisis to 
help ensure that every person has ac-
cess to clean air and clean water. 
It also means passing commonsense 
immigration reform that brings hu-
manity to our immigration system and 
recognizing that providing a pathway 
to citizenship for people living and con-
tributing to our country is part—a 
strategic part—of our economic recov-
ery as well. 
That means protecting and strength-
ening our democracy by passing voting 
rights and civil rights legislation. We 
should be making it easier, not harder, 
for eligible people to register to vote, 
to stay registered to vote, and to vote 
in every State in the country. 
But as President Obama said in his 
farewell address, ‘‘the work of democ-
racy has always been hard. It’s always 
been contentious. Sometimes it’s been 
bloody. For every two steps forward, it 
often feels like we take one step back.’’ 
It is no surprise that reactionary 
State leaders around the country, fear-
ful of losing elections, fearful of losing 
power, are mobilizing to suppress the 
vote as we speak. 
Enough is enough. This Senate must 
act aggressively to protect the right to 
vote, to strengthen the right to vote— 
no more steps back, only steps forward. 
We must act boldly because that is 
what this moment demands of us. We 
can’t let anything keep us from bold 
action and progress, including outdated 
rules and traditions. 
We must end the filibuster. For dec-
ades, the filibuster has been leveraged 
to obstruct progress. It helped main-
tain Jim Crow segregation, and it con-
tinues to entrench inequality in Amer-
ica today. We cannot allow the fili-
buster to prevent us from doing what is 
necessary to lift up millions of working 
families in every corner of the country. 
I believe we will beat this pandemic 
and get through this crisis. We will do 
it the same way we always have, the 
same way my parents did, the same 
way that American families and mil-
lions of immigrants throughout our 
history have done—by going to work 
and getting the job done. 
To my colleagues, I am so honored to 
serve with you and look forward to 
working alongside you for years to 
come. 
To my constituents, I am honored to 
represent you, and I will work hard 
every day to make you proud.

S1521 
March 15, 2021 
And to Angela, Roman, Alex, and 
Diego, I love you. Thank you for your 
love and your support of my public 
service. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that 
Senators LUJA´ N, CARPER, and myself be 
allowed to complete our remarks be-
fore the rollcall vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mrs. 
BLACKBURN. 
Thank 
you, 
Madam President. 
The southern border. The situation 
at our southern border has devolved 
into chaos. That is what I am hearing 
from some of my former House col-
leagues who have been on that border 
today. 
According to them, we are once again 
facing a crisis. Thirteen days ago, Cus-
toms and Border Protection announced 
that they were deploying more agents 
to help manage the spike and appre-
hensions of adults and unaccompanied 
alien children. 
Then, last Monday, news broke that 
Homeland 
Security 
Secretary 
Alejandro Mayorkas had sent an email 
to DHS staff begging for volunteers to 
go to the border and help with logistics 
and humanitarian aid. 
It is obvious they need help on the 
border. In January alone, the Customs 
and Border Patrol detained nearly 
78,000 people—more than double the 
number of apprehensions in January of 
2020. 
In February, that number jumped to 
more than 100,000 arrests and deten-
tions. CBP took more than 9,000 unac-
companied minors into custody that 
month, prompting the administration 
to open two overflow detention centers 
to house them. 
Listen to these numbers: 100,000 ar-
rests and detentions in February; 9,000 
unaccompanied minors being taken 
into custody that month—having to 
open 2 overflow detention centers. 
New data released last Wednesday 
shows that our agents are now detain-
ing more than 4,000 people along the 
border every single day—4,000 every 
day. 
Our facilities and resources are ex-
hausted, and so are the agents respon-
sible for controlling this out-of-control 
situation. 
It did not have to be this way. Sec-
retary 
Mayorkas 
has 
accused 
the 
Trump administration of ‘‘dismantling 
our Nation’s immigration system.’’ 
That is his quote. But if he wants to 
know who is really responsible, he 
should look to the current White 
House. 
I have stated time and again how dis-
astrous President Biden’s policy of gov-
erning by Executive fiat has been. 
Thirty-four Executive orders in his 
first 50 days—34. 
Also, he has suspended construction 
of the border wall, jeopardizing our na-
tional 
security. 
He 
has 
embraced 
DACA. He halted most deportations. 
He cut domestic immigration arrests 
by 60 percent and dismantled the mi-
grant protection protocols. 
This administration threw our exist-
ing immigration law out the window 
and let the world know that when it 
comes to illegal entry, not only will we 
look the other way, this administra-
tion is encouraging them to come. 
Even their Cabinet nominees are play-
ing by these new rules of encouraging 
individuals to break our laws, to come 
to the country illegally. They are en-
couraging this. 
Last week, this Chamber voted to 
discharge Xavier Becerra’s nomination 
from committee. I voted no. He is one 
of the most flagrant offenders out 
there when it comes to sending these 
signals. He has openly admitted he 
would like to decriminalize illegal 
entry and offer Medicaid to anyone 
who manages to get across the border. 
They have made a lot of promises 
that they know they are not going to 
be able to live up to, and now they are 
trying to walk it all back, walk back 
the hope that sparked in thousands of 
people because they have heard that 
the border was going to be open. They 
are even wearing the T-shirts with the 
slogan, ‘‘Biden, let us in.’’ 
They are going to have to walk back 
the mess that is there on the border, 
and I am fearful and concerned that 
their walk-backs are not going to work 
because from what we are hearing 
about the border, they have lost con-
trol of that border. 
I look forward to traveling to the 
border for a briefing on the situation. 
This administration does not want 
their critics to see what is happening 
down there. There are days you would 
think they have got a news blackout 
going at the border. 
This isn’t just a problem in Texas or 
California or Arizona or New Mexico. 
Every town is a border town and every 
State is a border State because of the 
drugs, the human trafficking, sex traf-
ficking, and gangs that are streaming 
across our border. 
You know, it means that no matter 
how hard you try, you can’t hide the 
tragedy that inevitably unfolds when 
your immigration policy is to have 
zero immigration policy at all, just 
open the border and let them come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
NOMINATION OF DEBRA ANNE HAALAND 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam President, I rise 
today in anticipation of a historic vote 
that the Senate will take in a few mo-
ments 
to 
confirm 
DEBRA
ANNE 
HAALAND as Secretary of the Interior. I 
am incredibly humbled to be able to 
preside over this body’s confirmation, 
in just a few minutes, of my good 
friend and fellow New Mexican. 
This marks the first time that a Na-
tive American will take her seat in the 
President’s Cabinet, making her the 
second highest ranking Native Amer-
ican to ever serve in the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
As a Pueblo woman and 35th-genera-
tion New Mexican, DEB HAALAND has a 
long overdue perspective to contribute 
to the Department of the Interior’s 
mission of protecting our natural re-
sources and public lands, and honoring 
America’s 
trust 
responsibilities 
to 
Tribal nations. 
She is uniquely equipped to begin to 
repair the relationship between the In-
terior and the domestic nations it 
serves—to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, 
these indigenous nations, these sov-
ereign nations, these important depart-
ments, the Indian Health Service, the 
Bureau of Indian Education. 
Speaking to Pueblo and Tribal mem-
bers in New Mexico, I know the signifi-
cance of her confirmation, how it tran-
scends policy. For young people in our 
State, she is the embodiment of the old 
adage that if you see it, you can be it. 
Knowing my friend DEB, although she 
will be the first, she is committed to 
not being the last. 
As former vice chair of the House 
Natural Resources Committee, DEB 
HAALAND
also brings a wealth of 
knowledge and experience to her role 
as the Interior Secretary. She has been 
a longtime champion of climate action, 
creating good-paying jobs, clean en-
ergy, and outdoor recreation. 
She played a key role in passing the 
Great American Outdoors Act out of 
the House of Representatives, success-
fully protecting New Mexico land-
scapes and setting ambitious goals for 
conservation with her Thirty by Thirty 
Resolution to Save Nature. But of all 
the 
qualifications 
and 
accomplish-
ments that DEB HAALAND will bring to 
the Department of the Interior, there 
is one that stands out to those who 
know her best—her empathy. 
DEB’s experience as a single mother 
struggling to keep a roof over her fam-
ily’s head allows her to connect with 
compassion to her constituents and in-
forms every aspect of her work. It is 
fitting that she will serve under a 
President who has made empathy the 
trademark of his administration. 
I have no doubt that Secretary 
HAALAND will leave a mark on the De-
partment of the Interior and on history 
as we know it. I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with my friend to 
make a difference for the people of New 
Mexico. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one 
floor above this Senate Chamber, near 
a bank of elevators, sit the marble 
busts of two leaders of the Ojibwa, or 
Chippewa, people who came to Wash-
ington, DC, in 1855 to sign a treaty 
with the U.S.Government. 
The terms of the treaty had been dic-
tated by the U.S. Government: The 
Ojibwa people would surrender more 
than 2 million acres of their ancestral 
homeland in northern Minnesota. In 
exchange, the Tribes would receive less 
than $20,000 in cash, goods, and serv-
ices, and assistance to resettle on two 
reservations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1522 
March 15, 2021 
There was no real negotiation. The 
Ojibwa has two choices: Accept the 
terms, or face annihilation. So the two 
chiefs, whose English names were Buf-
falo and Flat Mouth, signed the treaty 
and hoped that they had salvaged some 
future for their people. 
It was one of more than 500 treaties 
that Indian nations signed with the 
U.S. Government between 1778 and 1871. 
Like every one of those 500-plus trea-
ties, the 1855 treaty with the Ojibwa 
Nation was violated by the U.S. Gov-
ernment. 
The part of our government most re-
sponsible for carrying out treaty obli-
gations and maintaining government- 
to-government relations with Tribal 
nations was—and still is—the U.S. De-
partment of the Interior. That is part 
of what makes the vote we will take 
today so historic and important. 
It has taken too long—244 years—for 
a Native American to be included in a 
President’s Cabinet. 
DEB HALLAND is a leader of honor, in-
tegrity and vision, and I commend 
President Biden for nominating her to 
this important post. As Secretary of 
the Interior, she will oversee the de-
partment that manages America’s na-
tional parks and vast public lands. She 
also will lead the Bureau primarily re-
sponsible for maintaining relations be-
tween the U.S Government and the 
nearly 600 federally recognized, sov-
ereign Tribes within our national bor-
ders. 
Her nomination has the strong back-
ing of more than 500 national and re-
gional Tribal leaders, civil rights orga-
nizations, and environmental and con-
servation groups. She received bipar-
tisan support in the Senate Committee 
on 
Environment 
and 
Natural 
Re-
sources. 
She is a thoughtful and inclusive 
leader who will search for balanced so-
lutions on energy, climate, and natural 
resource policy. I also hope—and ex-
pect—that she will correct mistakes 
the previous administration made in 
removing protections for vast amounts 
of lands, including large portions of 
Bears Ears and the Grand Staircase- 
Escalante 
National 
Monuments 
in 
Utah. These natural and cultural treas-
ures are part of our shared national in-
heritance and must be protected. Deb 
Haaland understands that. 
In 2018, she became one of the first 
two indigenous women ever elected to 
Congress. She is a 35th-generation New 
Mexican and an enrolled member of the 
Laguna Pueblo, a Tribe of people who 
have lived on the land that is now New 
Mexico for 900 years. 
Defending this Nation is in her blood. 
Her father was a marine who received 
the Silver Star for his service in Viet-
nam and is buried in Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery. Her mother is a Navy 
veteran who worked for a quarter cen-
tury at the Bureau of Indian Edu-
cation, an Interior Department Agen-
cy. 
This historic nomination is an impor-
tant step towards healing a deep wound 
of our past, and it offers hope for a bet-
ter future. 
I 
am 
honored 
to 
support 
DEB 
HAALAND to serve as U.S. Secretary of 
the Interior. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
rise today to support the historic nom-
ination of DEB HAALAND to be Sec-
retary of the Interior. 
If 
confirmed, 
Congresswoman 
HAALAND will be the first Native Amer-
ican Cabinet Secretary. And how fit-
ting it would be at the Department of 
the Interior. After all, American Indi-
ans and Alaska Natives were the first 
stewards of this land. I know Rep-
resentative HAALAND will carry on that 
commitment as Interior Secretary. 
This nomination is important for all 
States, especially the State of Dela-
ware, which I am privileged to rep-
resent in the U.S. Senate. The First 
State, as we are known, may be small, 
but the Department of the Interior’s 
presence there is not. We are proud of 
our two National Wildlife Refugees and 
one 
of 
America’s 
newest 
national 
parks, the First State National Histor-
ical Park, which helps tell the story of 
the founding of our Nation leading up 
to the ratification of the U.S. Constitu-
tion. 
As I’ve gotten to know DEB HAALAND 
this year convinced that she is the 
right person to lead the Department of 
the Interior. We are at a critical junc-
ture in our quest to protect our public 
lands, wildlife, and environment for fu-
ture generations. She has spent her ca-
reer fighting for these things. As Inte-
rior Secretary, I know she will con-
tinue that fight with compassion and 
integrity. And, as Chairman of the Sen-
ate Committee on the Environment 
and Public Works, I look forward to 
working with her and the team she will 
lead on restoring protections for mi-
gratory birds and our nation’s most 
imperiled wildlife. 
If confirmed, DEB HAALAND will also 
take the bold steps needed to addres 
greatest threat we face—the climate 
crisis. I believe that under her leader-
ship, we will see offshore wind turbines 
in federal waters from Massachusetts 
to North Carolina, dramatically reduc-
ing carbon emissions. 
With that thought in mind, I look 
forward to working with her on ad-
vancing the Biden administration’s re-
newable 
energy 
agenda. 
DEB
has 
pledged to listen and work with all of 
us in her efforts to do so. 
Put simply, DEB HAALAND is what we 
want in our leaders. She is humble, not 
haughty, with the heart of a true pub-
lic servant. She works to unite, not di-
vide to build bridges, not walls. 
So, I strongly support her nomina-
tion and encourage all my colleagues 
to 
do 
the 
same 
confirming. 
DEB 
HAALAND will do great things for the 
American people. Let’s make it hap-
pen. 
Madam President, let me just speak 
from my heart. My friend who just pre-
ceded me knows DEB HAALAND from 
years of experience. Tom Udall, who 
served here for years, a close friend to 
all of us, has known DEB HAALAND for-
ever. 
I remember asking Tom Udall: What 
does she bring to the U.S. Department 
of the Interior? I will never forget what 
Tom said. He said: She will bring a 
good heart. She will bring a good mind. 
She has the heart of a servant. She is 
someone who is humble, not haughty. 
She will provide the leadership that is 
needed at the Department of the Inte-
rior after the years that we have been 
through. 
She will put together a good team, 
and when her team does well, she will 
give them the credit, and when her 
team falls short, she will take the 
blame. 
Those of us in the State of Delaware 
are proud to be the ‘‘First State.’’ We 
have two wonderful National Wildlife 
Refuges. We have a national park, one 
of the newest ones in the country, that 
really helps tell the story of the settle-
ment of our country from the early 
days of colonial settlements, right up 
to the ratification of the Constitution. 
The Constitution lays out what is ex-
pected of us serving here and in the ad-
ministration and also what is expected 
of Cabinet Secretaries, and it is seen in 
the, really the forward, if you will, the 
beginning, of the Constitution, where 
it says: ‘‘We the People of the United 
States, in Order to form a more perfect 
Union. . . . ’’ 
We can do better than what we are 
doing. We can do better than what we 
are doing with respect to protecting 
our National heritage, our wildlife, our 
migratory birds. We can do better in 
all of this. She will bring that commit-
ment to doing better. 
I will just close with this. I don’t be-
lieve we have ever had, in the history 
of our country, a Native American who 
has been nominated to serve as a Cabi-
net Secretary. I think she is the first, 
and we are from the ‘‘First State,’’ 
Delaware. The idea that she will be the 
first Native American, how appro-
priate, how appropriate. When you 
think about it, who were the original 
stewards of this land, our air and our 
water, the birds and the animals and 
fish that all live here and populate this 
land of ours? Native Americans were 
the first stewards. Native Alaskans 
were the first stewards. And it is only 
appropriate that, finally, we picked one 
of them. We chose one of them. 
She has been nominated by the Presi-
dent, gone through her confirmation 
hearing, and we have a chance, today, 
to complete the process by confirming 
the nomination of DEB HAALAND to be 
the Secretary of the Interior. I hope we 
will do that, and I thank you very 
much for allowing me to give these re-
marks. 
I yield the floor.

CONFIRMATION OF DEBRA ANNE HAALAND 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, just a 
word about the history-making nomi-
nation that was just approved by the 
Senate. We have now made history 
twice in the last few minutes. We have 
made history twice because we have 
nominated the first Native American 
Secretary of the Interior and the first 
Native American Cabinet official in 
American history. 
The confirmation of DEB HAALAND is 
amazing. It is a huge step forward, and 
now it creates a government that more 
embodies the full richness and diver-
sity of this country. We have known 
for so long the Native American com-
munity was treated badly, and we have 
a long way to go but we have begun 
with the ARP. And now with the ap-
proval of DEB HAALAND to be the Sec-
retary of the Interior, we are moving 
forward, and she will do a great job as 
Interior Secretary. She represents a 
turnaround because the Trump admin-
istration did more to undermine the re-
lationship between the Federal Govern-
ment and Tribes than has been done in 
a long time. DEB HAALAND will reverse 
that and move much further along. So 
we are proud of what the Senate has 
done.

f 
CONFIRMATION OF DEBRA ANNE 
HAALAND 
∑ Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I 
rise in support of the historic nomina-
tion of DEB HAALAND to serve as the 
next Secretary of the Interior. When 
confirmed, Congresswoman HAALAND 
will be the first Native American to 
serve in a Cabinet position. 
DEB
HAALAND’s nomination to be-
come Secretary of the Interior means 
so much to the future of this country. 
For the historically underrepresented 
and mistreated indigenous commu-
nities of these United States, it means 
that their experiences and perspectives 
will be valued and represented at the 
highest ranks of our Federal Govern-
ment. This important milestone and 
this reflection of their stories cannot 
be overstated. 
It means that young Americans and 
perhaps especially young people in in-
digenous communities, who put them-
selves through school, take out student 
loans, raise children, and run a busi-
ness, will see their struggles in this 
nominee and realize that they, too, can 
work their way to high-ranking gov-
ernment positions. 
DEB HAALAND’ s confirmation means 
that our country will, after 4 years of 
neglect and catering to the fossil fuel 
industry, work again to ensure that 
our natural resources are conserved for 
the next generation. 
It means that the Federal Govern-
ment will take swift, meaningful ac-
tions to address climate change. 
It means that trust and relationships 
between local communities, Tribes, 
and the Federal Government will be re-
stored and strengthened. 
My Republican colleagues have gone 
to great lengths to smear Congress-
woman HAALAND as an extremist. They 
point to the commonsense policies and 
positions that she took while rep-
resenting her constituents as ‘‘radical’’ 
and framing her as ‘‘outside the main-
stream.’’ They are adamantly opposed 
to President Biden’s environmental 
agenda and, regardless of what DEB 
HAALAND says in response to their con-
cerns, oppose her because they simply 
oppose the President’s agenda. 
If you took them for their word, you 
would believe that fossil fuels would 
disappear overnight. You would believe 
that workers in that industry would 
immediately lose their jobs, that our 
energy grids would become unreliable, 
that the sky would be falling. 
What they don’t talk about is how 
the Department of the Interior is put-
ting a pause on new, not existing, oil 
and gas leases. A pause. 
They 
don’t 
mention 
how 
DEB 
HAALAND, 
during 
her 
confirmation 
hearing, repeatedly assured them that 
the administration will not abandon 
workers and families in the fossil fuel 
industry as we transition to clean en-
ergy. 
They ignored and discounted her re-
peated commitments to working with 
Senators and stakeholders in their re-
spective States on issues that they 
care about. 
They don’t talk about the impacts of 
climate change on American commu-
nities, how climate change is an envi-
ronmental justice issue, or the benefits 
of expanding our country’s clean en-
ergy production. 
Instead, their message is simple—if 
the nominee is not beholden to the fos-
sil fuel industry, they won’t support 
them. 
Yes, President Biden’s environmental 
agenda is bold. His commitments to ad-
dressing climate change, which he 
identified as a crisis, are strong. 
We as a country cannot afford to con-
tinue with the fossil fuel extracting, 
carbon emitting status quo. 
We cannot keep burying our heads in 
the sand and kicking the can down the 
road, expecting our children and grand-
children to clean up our messes. 
President Biden committed to tack-
ling some of the greatest challenges of 
our lifetime, and he named climate 
change as one of the four great crises 
of our time. 
Major changes will need to happen 
including our old ways of thinking. We 
need to be bold, innovative, and think 
outside the box. 
As our country takes on these issues, 
challenges and opportunities are inevi-
table. By having DEB HAALAND at the 
helm of Interior, I know that our local 
communities from Hawaii, to Alaska, 
to Maine, and everywhere in between, 
will have a Secretary willing to listen, 
a Secretary who will take the time to 
understand their issues. 
Our country can successfully transi-
tion from overreliance on fossil fuels, 
increase our clean energy production, 
protect our environment, and make 
real progress on climate change by 
working together. 
Mr. President, a family emergency 
has kept me from being in attendence 
for today’s vote. If I were present, I 
would have voted to confirm DEB 
HAALAND as Secretary of the Interior. 
It is not only a historic vote but one of 
hope. I urge my colleagues to join me 
in my support.∑

following statement was ordered to be

waii to tend to a family matter.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
section 36(b) of the Arms Export Con-
trol Act requires that Congress receive 
prior notification of certain proposed 
arms sales as defined by that statute. 
Upon such notification, the Congress 
has 30 calendar days during which the 
sale may be reviewed. The provision 
stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent 
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
DEFENSE SECURITY 
COOPERATION AGENCY, 
Arlington, VA. 
Hon. ROBERT MENENDEZ, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Pursuant to the re-
porting requirements of Section 36(b)(1) of 
the Arms Export Control Act, as amended, 
we are forwarding herewith Transmittal No. 
21–24 concerning the Navy’s proposed Let-
ter(s) of Offer and Acceptance to the Govern-
ment of Germany for defense articles and 
services estimated to cost $1.77 billion. After 
this letter is delivered to your office, we plan 
to issue a news release to notify the public of

This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by improving the security of a NATO 
Ally which is an important force for political 
and economic stability in Europe. 
The proposed sale will improve Germany’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by providing critical capabilities to 
coalition maritime operations. Germany cur-
rently operates the Lockheed P–3C Orion, 
but that aircraft is reaching end-of-life and 
will retire in 2024. Germany plans to replace 
it with the P–8A Poseidon. The proposed sale 
will allow Germany to modernize and sustain 
its Maritime Surveillance Aircraft (MSA) ca-
pability for the next 30 years. Germany will 
have no difficulty transitioning its MSA 
force to P–8 and absorbing these aircraft into 
its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractor will be The Boeing 
Company, Seattle, WA. There are no known 
offset agreements proposed in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of the proposed sale will 
require the assignment of four (4) U.S. Gov-
ernment and four (4) contractor representa-
tives to Germany for a duration of two (2) 
years to support equipment familiarization, 
training and supply support. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Mr. PORTMAN (for himself and Ms.

lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 109 
Whereas native plants are indigenous spe-
cies that have evolved and occur naturally in 
a particular region, ecosystem, and habitat; 
Whereas there are more than 17,000 native 
plant species in the United States, which in-
clude trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, and 
wildflowers; 
Whereas native plants help prevent flood-
ing, drought, and erosion and can help re-
store damaged ecosystems; 
Whereas native plants provide shelter as 
well as nectar, pollen, and seeds that serve 
as food for native butterflies, insects, birds, 
and other wildlife in ways that non-native 
plants cannot; 
Whereas more than 200 of the native plant 
species in the United States are estimated to 
have been lost since the early 19th century; 
Whereas habitat loss and degradation, ex-
treme weather events, and invasive species 
have contributed to the decline of native 
plants in the United States; and 
Whereas native plants are essential compo-
nents of resilient ecosystems and our natural 
heritage: Now, therefore, be it

SENATE RESOLUTION 111—DESIG-
NATING 
MARCH 
29, 
2021, 
AS 
‘‘VIETNAM VETERANS DAY’’ 
Mr. BURR (for himself and Mr. 
MANCHIN) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 111 
Whereas the Vietnam War was fought in 
the Republic of Vietnam from 1955 to 1975 
and involved regular forces from the Demo-
cratic Republic of Vietnam and Viet Cong 
guerrilla forces in armed conflict with the 
Armed Forces of the United States, the 
armed forces of allies of the United States, 
and the armed forces of the Republic of Viet-
nam; 
Whereas the Armed Forces of the United 
States became involved in Vietnam because 
the United States Government wanted to 
provide direct support by the Armed Forces 
to the Government of the Republic of Viet-
nam to defend against the growing threat of 
Communism from the Democratic Republic 
of Vietnam; 
Whereas members of the Armed Forces of 
the United States began serving in an advi-
sory role to the Government of South Viet-
nam in 1955; 
Whereas, as a result of the incidents in the 
Gulf of Tonkin on August 2 and 4, 1964, Con-
gress approved the Gulf of Tonkin Resolu-
tion (Public Law 88–408) by an overwhelming 
majority on August 7, 1964, which provided to 
the President of the United States the au-
thority to use armed force to assist the Re-
public of Vietnam in the defense of its free-
dom against the Democratic Republic of 
Vietnam; 
Whereas, in 1965, ground combat units of 
the Armed Forces of the United States ar-
rived in the Republic of Vietnam to join ap-
proximately 23,000 personnel of the Armed 
Forces who were already present there; 
Whereas, 
by 
September 
1965, 
between 
150,000 and 190,000 troops of the Armed Forces 
of the United States were in Vietnam, and by 
1969, the number of such troops reached a 
peak of approximately 549,500, including 
members of the Armed Forces who were sup-
porting the combat operations from Thai-
land, Cambodia, Laos, and aboard Navy ves-
sels; 
Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Agree-
ment on Ending the War and Restoring 
Peace in Viet-Nam (commonly known as the 
‘‘Paris Peace Accords’’) was signed, which re-
quired the release of all prisoners of war of 
the United States held in North Vietnam and 
the withdrawal of all Armed Forces of the 
United States from South Vietnam; 
Whereas, on March 29, 1973, the Armed 
Forces of the United States completed the 
withdrawal of combat units and combat sup-
port units from South Vietnam; 
Whereas, on April 30, 1975, North Viet-
namese regular forces captured Saigon, the 
capital of South Vietnam, effectively placing 
South Vietnam under Communist control; 
Whereas more than 58,000 members of the 
Armed Forces of the United States lost their 
lives in the Vietnam War, and more than 
300,000 members of the Armed Forces of the 
United States were wounded in Vietnam; 
Whereas, in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial in the District of Columbia was 
dedicated to commemorate the members of 
the Armed Forces of the United States who 
died or were declared missing in action in 
Vietnam; 
Whereas the Vietnam War was an ex-
tremely divisive issue among the people of 
the United States and a conflict that caused 
a generation of veterans to wait too long for 
the public of the United States to acknowl-
edge and honor the efforts and services of 
those veterans; 
Whereas members of the Armed Forces 
who served bravely and faithfully for the 
United States during the Vietnam War were 
often wrongly criticized for the decisions of 
policymakers that were beyond the control 
of those members; and 
Whereas designating March 29, 2021, as 
‘‘Vietnam Veterans Day’’ would be an appro-
priate way to honor the members of the 
Armed Forces of the United States who 
served in South Vietnam and throughout 
Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates March 29, 2021, as ‘‘Vietnam 
Veterans Day’’; 
(2) honors and recognizes the contributions 
of the veterans of the Armed Forces of the 
United States who served in Vietnam during 
war and during peace; 
(3) encourages States and local govern-
ments to designate March 29, 2021, as ‘‘Viet-
nam Veterans Day’’; and 
(4) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe Vietnam Veterans Day 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities 
that— 
(A) provide the appreciation that veterans 
of the Vietnam War deserve; 
(B) demonstrate the resolve that the peo-
ple of the United States shall never forget 
the sacrifices and service of a generation of 
veterans who served in the Vietnam War; 
(C) promote awareness of the faithful serv-
ice and contributions of the veterans of the 
Vietnam War— 
(i) during service in the Armed Forces of 
the United States; and 
(ii) to the communities of the veterans 
since returning home; 
(D) promote awareness of the importance 
of entire communities empowering veterans 
and the families of veterans in helping the 
veterans readjust to civilian life after serv-
ice in the Armed Forces; and 
(E) promote opportunities for veterans of 
the Vietnam War— 
(i) to assist younger veterans returning 
from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in re-
habilitation from wounds, both seen and un-
seen; and 
(ii) to support the reintegration of younger 
veterans into civilian life.

ANNIVERSARY 
FOR 
CREATING PATHWAYS TO PROS-
PERITY 
FOR 
UNDERSERVED 
COMMUNITIES ON THE AFRICAN 
CONTINENT 
THROUGH 
COMMU-
NITY-LED DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. 
INHOFE) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 114 
Whereas December 16, 2020, marked the 
40th anniversary of the establishment of the 
United States African Development Founda-
tion (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘USADF’’); 
Whereas, on December 16, 1980, the Presi-
dent signed the African Development Foun-
dation Act (22 U.S.C. 290h et seq.) into law, 
which established the USADF as an inde-
pendent Federal agency with the goal to— 
(1) strengthen the bonds of friendship and 
understanding between the people of the 
countries of Africa and the United States; 
(2) support local capacity building to cre-
ate community development opportunities 
and expand the participation of the countries 
of Africa in their development process; and 
(3) foster the establishment and growth of 
indigenous development institutions that are 
equipped to respond to local needs; 
Whereas, for 40 years, the USADF has in-
vested in a pan-African network of local im-
plementing partners that employ a commu-
nity-led development approach to support 
African-designed and African-delivered solu-
tions; 
Whereas the USADF has provided more 
than 3,400 grassroots and community enter-
prise grants in more than 40 sub-Saharan Af-
rican countries; 
Whereas the USADF strengthens food secu-
rity, empowers smallholder farmers, and cre-
ates economic growth in rural, hard-to-reach 
communities by investing primarily in agri-
cultural enterprises to increase access to 
larger markets for those rural communities 
and 
enhance 
the 
business 
management 
skills, production, distribution, and mar-
keting capabilities of those rural commu-
nities; 
Whereas the USADF has maintained a 
strong emphasis on women and women entre-
preneurs, and women represent up to 65 per-
cent of the direct beneficiaries of grants 
from the USADF; 
Whereas, on February 20, 2020, the USADF 
partnered with the Academy for Entre-
preneurs of the Department of State under 
the Women’s Global Development and Pros-
perity Initiative to provide seed funding to 
graduates of the Academy for Entrepreneurs 
to advance the global economic empower-
ment of women; 
Whereas the USADF prioritizes partner-
ships with youth and supports nearly 300 so-
cial enterprises of Young African Leaders 
Initiative fellows and alumni of that initia-
tive in 37 sub-Saharan African countries by 
providing seed capital, technical assistance, 
and skills training to help young entre-
preneurs create businesses that generate new 
jobs and incomes for thousands of young Af-
ricans; 
Whereas the work of the USADF in the off- 
grid energy sector, which is authorized under 
the Electrify Africa Act of 2015 (22 U.S.C. 
2293 note), has helped bring renewable energy 
solutions to communities with limited or no 
connections to national power grids and im-
prove energy access for nearly 370,000 indi-
viduals in 15 sub-Saharan African countries; 
Whereas the USADF’s model of using 100 
percent African staff and implementing part-
ners on the African continent gives the 
USADF the ability to work in fragile and 
conflict-affected areas in the Great Lakes, 
Horn, and Sahel regions of Africa; 
Whereas the small size of the USADF and 
the use of local implementing partners by 
the USADF has allowed the USADF to be 
ranked as one of the most efficient providers 
of foreign aid by the Center for Global Devel-
opment; 
Whereas the partnerships of the USADF 
with agencies of the Federal Government, in-
cluding the Department of State, the Millen-
nium Challenge Corporation, and the United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment, along with the alignment of the 
USADF with the priorities of Congress, have 
allowed the USADF to extend the reach of 
critical 
development 
initiatives 
of 
the 
United States, such as initiatives authorized 
by the Global Food Security Act of 2016 (22 
U.S.C. 9301 et seq.), the Electrify Africa Act 
of 2015 (22 U.S.C. 2293 note), and the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium 
Challenge Act Modernization Act (Public 
Law 115-167; 132 Stat. 1276); 
Whereas the partnerships between the 
USADF and private sector corporations and 
foundations, as well as African national and 
sub-national governments, have allowed the 
USADF to extend its reach and development 
impact in addressing food insecurity, insuffi-
cient access to energy, and unemployment 
through youth and women entrepreneurship 
and job skills training and placement in Af-
rica, while leveraging funding to help the 
dollars of taxpayers in the United States go 
further; and 
Whereas investments made by the USADF 
have developed and strengthened an exten-
sive network of grassroots enterprises and 
social enterprises that are positively dis-
posed to the United States and are better po-
sitioned to partner with other Federal agen-
cies and public and private funders: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commends the United States African 
Development Foundation on the occasion of 
its 40th anniversary for creating pathways to 
prosperity for underserved communities on 
the African continent through community- 
led development; 
(2) recognizes that, by supporting African- 
led development that grows community en-
terprises, the United States African Develop-
ment Foundation empowers individuals who 
are least served by existing markets or as-
sistance programs to become a part of the 
growth story of Africa; 
(3) recognizes that the United States Afri-
can Development Foundation advances the 
foreign policy of the Federal Government 
and contributes directly to the national in-
terests of the United States; and 
(4) commits to continue to support the 
vital work of the United States African De-
velopment Foundation as an independent 
agency.

f 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, in 
this country we are so blessed to call 
home, every woman, no matter her 
background—like growing up on a 
small farm in Iowa—can be the next 
first. 
After serving in the U.S. Army Re-
serves and the Iowa Army National 
Guard—a historically male field—I be-
came the first female combat veteran 
elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. I 
was also the first woman to represent 
the great State of Iowa in Congress. 
Now, just 6 years later, women make 
up a majority of the Iowa congres-
sional delegation. Iowa is also blessed 
with a fierce female Governor in Kim 
Reynolds and some extremely talented 
and strong women leaders in our State 
legislature. Today, there are over 140 
women serving in Congress—more than 
ever before in U.S. history. 
Because of the suffragettes and so 
many other determined women who 
stepped up and broke the barriers soci-
ety placed on us, female trailblazers 
across this country are writing new 
pages in history books every single 
day. Women have made strides in the 
boardroom, on the playing field, in the 
military, and through elected office. 
But this pandemic has been tough on 
women in the workforce, threatening 
to derail the progress we have made. 
Before COVID, women made up the ma-
jority of the U.S. workforce, but 1 year 
later, women have lost over 2 million 
jobs—nearly 1 million more than our 
male counterparts. 
There are many reasons for this but 
two major factors. First, moms tend to 
be the sole caregivers in the family. 
With 
schools 
going 
remote 
and 
childcare 
centers 
closing, 
working 
moms have been forced to choose be-
tween their careers and their children. 
Second, women tend to work in fields 
that have been hit the hardest by the 
pandemic, such as the hospitality in-
dustry, restaurants, education, and re-
tail. 
We absolutely need to focus on get-
ting these women back into the work-
force and on their feet so that they can 
support themselves and their families. 
The focus needs to be on three things: 
first, safely reopening our schools; sec-
ond, expanding access to childcare, 
which I have worked with the Pre-
siding Officer on—thank you very 
much; and producing, distributing, and 
administering the vaccine as quickly 
as possible so folks can get back to 
work safely. 
If I were able to choose the theme for 
Women’s History Month based off of 
this past year struggling through the 
pandemic, it would be ‘‘Overcomer.’’ 
Woman to woman, we all, no matter 
what we do, are overcomers by nature. 
Moms, you overcome so much every 
single day when you work tirelessly at 
the thankless and never-ending job of 
caring for your children and for your 
families. You have the one and only job 
that you cannot simply clock out of, 
especially this year, when many of you 
had to balance being a teacher for the 
first time in your life. 
Women in the workforce, you over-
come stereotypes daily and have con-
tinued to smash glass ceilings and set 
new standards in corporate America. 
Your resilience and strength alongside 
our historic women’s rights heroes con-
tinue to shape a bright future for all 
young girls across this country. 
In honor of Women’s History Month, 
I challenge everyone to remember the 
sacrifices it took to secure the free-
doms and opportunities we women 
enjoy today and continue to build on 
these opportunities for the next gen-
eration. 
Whether that is in your local commu-
nity or State or Federal Government, 
we are a better nation because of the 
contributions of women in all walks of 
life, in all fields of service, and in both 
Chambers of Congress, and it is impor-
tant to continue to remind folks of 
that. 
It is my hope that each and every 
young woman, no matter your home-
town or your background, will see the 
opportunity and potential that lie 
ahead. Many of us have heard this real-
ly outdated quote: ‘‘Act like a lady, 
but think like a man.’’ Well, I think 
history has proven that, instead, we 
should say: ‘‘Act like a woman, and 
think like a woman’’ because we are 
powerful, we are fearless, we are smart, 
and we are strong just the way we are. 
I yield the floor.
