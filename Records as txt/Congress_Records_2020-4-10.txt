God of Mercy, thank You for giving 
us another day. 
Bless the Members of the people’s 
House today. 
Good Friday—a day when millions of 
Americans recall and mourn the death 
of the Suffering Servant. Good Friday, 
today, when thousands of Americans 
are servants, suffering through the 
care of those stricken by COVID–19 
with inadequate safety supplies. 
Passover, when millions of Ameri-
cans celebrate the liberation of the 
chosen people from slavery. Passover, 
when millions of Americans experience 
the lack of freedom—to gather with 
family, to celebrate the passages of life 
together. 
Lord, these are days of suffering and 
turmoil not only for Americans but for 
all 
Your 
children 
throughout 
the 
world. Help us; heal us; have mercy on 
us. Protect those who daily place 
themselves in harm’s way in service to 
those threatened by the coronavirus. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF 
FLOOR DOCUMENTS 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 10, 2020 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD the following Dear Colleague let-
ter I sent Members on April 6, 2020, in re-
sponse to the current public health crisis: 
APRIL 6, 2020. 
DEAR COLLEAGUE: During this time of cri-
sis, House leadership and institutional staff 
continue to examine all possible steps to pro-
tect the health and safety of Members and 
our staffs, so that we are best able to serve 
our constituents. 
In that spirit, in consultation with the 
Rules Committee, Committee on House Ad-
ministration, Office of the Clerk and Office 
of the Parliamentarian and in accordance 
with current social distancing guidelines, 
the House will soon take additional action to 
reduce the physical presence of Members and 
staff in the Capitol, by formalizing a new 
system for submission of documents related 
to Floor action. 
Beginning Tuesday, staff must electroni-
cally submit all Floor documents—including 
bills, resolutions, co-sponsors and extensions 
of remarks—to a dedicated and secure email 
system, rather than deliver these materials 
by hand to staff in the Speaker’s Lobby or 
Cloakrooms. At this time, Members may 
still drop off materials in person. Electronic 
submissions will be accepted when the House 
is in pro forma session, as well as 15 minutes 
immediately before and after. This upcoming 
week’s pro forma sessions will be held Tues-
day at 11:30 AM E.T. and Friday at 9:00 AM 
E.T. Pro forma sessions for the remainder of 
the month are expected to follow a similar 
schedule. Later today, the Clerk’s Office will 
send out detailed guidance on where and how 
to submit materials. 
Please be advised that this policy will be 
effective through April 19 and may be ex-
tended if continued disruption of House oper-
ations remains necessary due to the pan-
demic. Normal practice for Floor submis-
sions will resume once the House returns 
full-time to the Capitol for regular business. 
During this Holy Season for people of 
many faiths, let us pray for those families 
who have lost a loved one, those who are sick 
and those who are ministering to their 
needs. 
Take care, be well and stay strong. 
Sincerely, 
NANCY.

REMEMBERING GEORGIA SENATOR 
JACK HILL 
HON. RICK W. ALLEN 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 10, 2020 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
remember the life of a Georgia legend, State 
Senator Jack Hill. 
Jack represented his home of Reidsville in 
the State Senate since 1991. For decades he 
ensured Georgia’s budget was balanced, fair, 
and served the people well. The State of 
Georgia is a better place thanks to his leader-
ship. 
His love for his hometown was evident in 
everything he did, from running his grocery 
store business as owner and operator of Hill 
Shopping Center, to serving in the Georgia Air 
National Guard for over three decades, includ-
ing as a unit commander and State Inspector 
General. 
While some will say he was a pillar of the 
community, I believe he wasn’t just a pillar; he 
was the foundation upon which the pillars 
were built. 
Jack Hill was a true statesman and he will 
be sorely missed by many, but especially by 
his wife Ruth Ann, their children, and grand-
children. However, I am confident his impact 
on our great state will be felt for generations 
to come.

applaud 
Jacob 
Gavaldon for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Jacob Gavaldon is a student at Arvada K– 
8 and received this award because his deter-
mination and hard work have allowed him to 
overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Jacob 
Gavaldon is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to

have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

ing the community should inspire us all. 
Vidalia is a special place, known for growing 
the sweetest onions in the world—a distinction 
which Ronnie was immensely proud. His sup-
port of our farmers will be remembered for 
generations, as agriculture is Georgia’s top in-
dustry. 
Ronnie’s passion for service has left a last-
ing impact on the Vidalia community, and it 
has been felt throughout the entire state of 
Georgia. It is my privilege to honor his life and

Representatives.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL 
WITKOWSKY 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 10, 2020 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the life of Michael 
Witkowsky—a beloved father, grandfather, 
husband, and friend—who passed away on 
March 30, 2020, at the age of 80. 
Mike was born in Los Angeles on January 
14, 1940, to Rebecca and Irving Witkowsky. 
He graduated from Hamilton High School in 
1957 and married Hope Witkowsky in 1959. 
Last year, I was honored to attend their 60th 
wedding anniversary. 
Mike was an accomplished and well-re-
spected health insurance agent who was com-
mitted to providing exemplary service and care 
to American families. He became an insurance 
agent with Farmers Insurance Group in 1961 
and planned to retire on March 31, 2020. Dur-
ing his extensive and impressive tenure, he 
received numerous awards from Farmers In-
surance, including the Presidents Council, the 
company’s most elite honor for the top one- 
percent of agents and district managers. 
Mike later became a United Healthcare 
agent in 2008 and continued to receive 
awards every year. He was helping people 
right to the very end, even from his hospital 
bed. Mike passed away with the largest book 
of business in Los Angeles County. 
In addition to his professional work, Mike 
was an active member of his local community 
and a dedicated family member. Hope served 
as a Torrance City Councilmember and Mike 
was his wife’s biggest supporter. He also vol-
unteered at many local events in Torrance, in-
cluding running a booth at the Fourth of July 
celebration and announcing and riding in the 
annual Armed Forces Parade. From 1968 to 
1977, he coached several Little League teams 
and later volunteered to become an umpire. 
Mike never missed an activity that his chil-
dren or grandchildren participated in. Over one 
summer in 1999, he took his granddaughters 
to visit every park in Torrance—one park 
every day. A die-hard Dodger fan, Michael 
carried a warm smile wherever he went. 
Mike is survived by his wife Hope, his son 
Daniel, his daughter Debra, his grandchildren 
Nicole, Stacy, Denise, Max, Elizabeth, and 
great grandchildren Chloe and Devin. I hope 
they take comfort in the way Mike lived his life 
as a patriotic and caring citizen. My wife Betty 
and I dearly miss our friend Mike. May his 
memory be a blessing to us all.

REMEMBERING AND CELEBRATING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
SAMUEL 
LEWIS 
LIEBERMAN 
HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 10, 2020 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to re-
member and celebrate the life of a dear friend, 
Sam Lieberman. 
First, let me say how honored I am today to 
speak in memory of a fine man, Sam Lieber-
man, and in celebration of his remarkable life. 
I want to thank Clifton Whitehurst, who I know 
was like a brother to Sam and such an amaz-
ing caregiver, Rabbi Mintz who inspires us all 
with her grace and wisdom, and Sam’s mother 
Sara from whom he inherited so many admi-
rable qualities. 
I first met Sam at UNLV in the mid-eighties 
when he took a political science class from 
me. He soon became more than just a student 
passing through. He loved to tell how I threw 
an eraser at him one time when he fell asleep 
in class and how I told him he’d have made 
an A if he hadn’t napped through half my lec-
tures—but that is just urban myth. Sam was 
really a good student, though in no hurry to 
graduate, a political junkie, and, I soon 
learned, a die-hard Democrat. 
Along with several other students, Sam is 
pictured in a political brochure from my first 
election to the State Senate. And he spent 
many a Saturday in my garage handing out 
walking packets and directing volunteers. 
Sam’s diligence and hard work for lots of 
candidates were rewarded when the Demo-
cratic Party elected him Chair from 2008 to 
2011. From that position he led the party 
through some rough patches and some in-
credible victories. And what fun we had in 
Tonopah at central committee meetings and 
especially at the Democratic Convention. Sam 
was always there: tending to business, helping 
others, and moving us all in the right direction. 
He did it with humor, with steadfastness, and 
with compassion. 
He brought those same traits to his position 
as Regent—and I think he got a chuckle out 
of now being my boss. He believed so strong-
ly in the value of education and fought to ex-
tend its reach to disadvantaged communities. 
He never let his own disability get in the 
way—he was everywhere—ball games, regent 
meetings, public addresses. Everybody knew 
and loved Sam. 
I also saw Sam in Washington when he 
came to the Hill to advocate for organizations, 
like NVPEP (People Encouraging People) and 
Easterseals, that serve those living with dis-
abilities and their families. He was a powerful 
voice because he spoke from experience; he 
never bemoaned the fact that he wasn’t more 
mobile; and he proved how someone with 
conviction could accomplish anything. 
Sam was such a good friend—he even once 
gave me his famous lemon bar recipe but 
made me promise not to tell anyone the secret 
ingredients. His passing came as a shock and 
it is hard to imagine that I won’t be seeing 
him—everywhere I turn—asking his advice, in-
troducing him at some award ceremony (he 
received many), or sharing a funny story that 
happened out on the trail. Tom and my mother 
Betty and I will miss him so very much. His 
passing is a great loss to Nevada, to the 
Democratic Party, and to his many friends. 
I include in the RECORD the words of Dr. 
Marta Meana, President of the University of 
Nevada, Las Vegas, in her memorial of Sam 
Lieberman, along with his official obituary. 
Dear University Community, 
UNLV lost one of its greatest champions 
on Friday with the untimely passing of 
alumnus and Regent Sam Lieberman. 
Sam was quite simply a force for good. In 
so many ways. 
His involvement as a UNLV student in the 
early 1980s set him on a path to pursue, and 
be a champion for, higher education. After 
graduating from UNLV with a degree in so-
cial work in 1996, Sam served as a member of 
the UNLV Alumni Association Board and 
helped start the alumni chapter for the Col-
lege of Liberal Arts. He would later be

named the college’s alumnus of the year, and 
in 2014 he was elected as a member of the Ne-
vada System of Higher Education Board of 
Regents. 
Sam had an acute ability to discern the 
link between systems and the people they 
impact, with an endless drive to make them 
better. His ever-present wit and humor 
brought levity, even during tough conversa-
tions. Perhaps, even more, I’ll miss his em-
pathy and insight into the needs of our stu-
dents, and his vast knowledge of UNLV and 
of higher education in Nevada. He used his 
voice to advocate for the vulnerable, he cele-
brated our wins, and he was there to support 
us whenever we needed him. 
To say Sam was active on campus would be 
an understatement. He was a constant pres-
ence at UNLV, from major events to small 
department-level functions. Sam was always 
there for us, as he was for so many organiza-
tions throughout Nevada. 
It feels impossible to quantify Sam’s mon-
umental impact. There are so many people 
he helped and those people, in turn, have 
helped others. The human connections he 
made and the lives he lifted up through high-
er education are a small part of the legacy 
he left behind. 
There are few in UNLV’s history who have 
displayed as much passion and commitment 
for our students, and for the success of ev-
eryone at our university, as Sam Lieberman. 
He will be deeply missed. 
As we reflect on Sam’s life and legacy, let’s 
try to live how Sam lived—to lend a voice to 
those who need it, to be kind and truly listen 
to one another, and to lift each other up at 
a time when it is so desperately needed. 
Please take care of yourselves, and each 
other. 
Godspeed, Sam. 
OBITUARY OF SAMUEL LEWIS LIEBERMAN 
Samuel Lewis Lieberman, age 58, passed 
away Friday April 3, 2020 in Las Vegas, Ne-
vada. At his core, Sam was a social being 
who thrived on connection to other people. 
Sam devoted all of his life and energy to 
helping others—most notably in Las Vegas 
where he lived for almost 40 years, and also 
through his lifelong relationship with the 
Olin-Sang-Ruby Union Institute (OSRUI, a 
Reform 
Jewish 
summer 
camp) 
in 
Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. 
Sam was the oldest child of David and Sara 
Lieberman, and was born in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota. He was born with cerebral palsy, 
which was a significant physical disability, 
but he never let that get in the way of any-
thing he wanted to do, and he never com-
plained . . . EVER. Sam grew up on Lake 
Harriet, along with his siblings Jonathan, 
Barbara and Michael. As a teenager, he was 
very active in Jewish youth activities at 
Temple Israel Youth Group, Camp TEKO and 
NFTY, and he attended Southwest Junior 
High. During high school summers, Sam 
worked at OSRUI, where he ran the summer 
camp office. Sam graduated from Marshall- 
University High School in 1980 and then left 
Minneapolis to attend college at the Univer-
sity of Nevada-Las Vegas (UNLV). At UNLV, 
Sam immersed himself in all aspects of stu-
dent life—so much so that it took him 16 
years to complete his studies in order to 
graduate! Through this experience, he devel-
oped a passion for ensuring that people of all 
backgrounds and abilities had access to edu-
cation. 
As an adult, Sam worked with boundless 
energy as an advocate for several important 
causes—including as a trusted aide to Sen-
ator Harry Reid of Nevada, Chairman of the 
Nevada Democratic Party, a Board Member 
of Nevada PEP (an organization devoted to 
parents of children with disabilities), Presi-
dent of Congregation P’nai Tikvah and mem-
ber of the Board of Regents of the Nevada 
System of Higher Education. He was also a 
kind, warm, funny and loyal friend to so 
many people of all ages and backgrounds. 
(He has 4,455 friends on Facebook, and the 
flood of messages on his Facebook pages is 
an uplifting thing to read.) 
Sam loved to eat too. In Minneapolis, it 
was prime rib at the King’s Inn, egg rolls at 
the Nankin and corned beef sandwiches at 
the Lincoln Del. In Las Vegas, it was shrimp 
cocktail and a Coke at The Tillerman, and a 
ribeye steak, twice-baked potato and Caesar 
salad at the Golden Steer. He also adored 
chicken soup with kreplach made by his 
Baba Adele Lieberman—though she only 
made kreplach on special occasions. He 
didn’t really drink alcohol, except he would 
order Bailey’s Irish Cream and coffee—and 
sip it through a straw. 
Sam also had a deep love and fierce devo-
tion to his family—which included not only 
his parents, siblings, nieces, nephews, aunts, 
uncles and cousins, but also his devoted 
friend and caregiver Clifton Whitehurst and 
Clifton’s daughter Alyssa Whitehurst. Sam is 
preceded in death by his father David Lieber-
man, and is survived by his mother Sara, sib-
lings Jonathan, Barbara and Michael, sis-
ters-in-law Lisa Kayne Lieberman and Jessie 
Washburne-Harris, 
brother-in-law 
Sam 
Askenazi, nieces and nephews Rebecca, Char-
lotte, Benjamin and Gabriella, uncle Stephen 
Lieberman, aunts Sheila Lieberman and 
Sandra Okinow and a large and loving group 
of cousins. 
The world is a better place for his having 
been here, and he will be greatly missed!

HONORING DOLORES HUERTA 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 10, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, 
today April 10, 2020 marks the 90th birthday 
of civil rights activist and labor leader Dolores 
Huerta. A Central Valley hero and a national 
labor icon, she has dedicated her entire life to 
advocating for social, economic, and political 
justice for farmworkers and disadvantaged 
communities throughout the United States. 
Her leadership in the fight against discrimina-
tion and staunch advocacy for civil rights 
make her an example for all that seek eco-
nomic and social justice. 
Co-founding the National Farmworkers As-
sociation with Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta 
fiercely negotiated with agricultural enterprises 
and spearheaded the movement towards bet-
ter rights and protections for farmworkers. 
Often the only woman at the table, her 
strength and resiliency stood strong through 
decades of protests, advocacy, and positive 
change. 
In 1965, the United Farm Workers (UFW) 
union organized and implemented the historic 
Delano grape strike. With Dolores serving as 
the lead negotiator, the UFW secured work-
place rights for thousands of farmworkers. She 
was instrumental in the enactment of the Agri-
cultural Labor Relations Act of 1975 which 
was the first law of its kind in U.S. history, 
granting farmworkers in California the right to 
collectively organize and bargain for better 
wages and working conditions. 
In 2002, Huerta established the Dolores 
Huerta Foundation, ensuring a legacy of com-
munity activism and civic engagement for gen-
erations to come. The work of this organiza-
tion directly benefits the communities of the 
Central Valley, providing organizing training 
and resources to rural, low-income commu-
nities and mobilizing volunteers to make a dif-
ference. 
In recognition of her tireless work and advo-
cacy, in 2012 President Obama awarded Do-
lores Huerta with the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom, our nation’s highest civilian honor. 
Madam Speaker, we wish Dolores Huerta a 
happy 90th Birthday and thank her for her tire-
less work and countless contributions to the 
United States. ‘‘Sı´ Se Puede’’ will always echo 
in my ears as we work together in Congress 
and in our communities to protect and pro-
mote the rights of farmworkers and workers 
everywhere.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 10, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise

for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. Jason Orozco 
is a student at Jefferson High School and re-
ceived this award because his determination

adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Jason 
Orozco is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will

have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

Friday, April 10, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor two brave police officers, Officer 
Alicia Hubert and Officer Marissa Dowhan, 
both with the Phoenix Police Department. 
On Sunday, March 29, 2020 these two offi-

sponded to a domestic disturbance call where 
a tragic shooting took place. It was dev-
astating to hear that Commander Carnicle was 
fatally shot and Officers Hubert and Dowhan 
were both seriously injured. 
It is situations like this, that remind us what 
our men and women in blue sacrifice daily for 
the protection of others and I can’t thank them 
enough. 
On this day, we honor both Officer Hubert 
and Officer Dowhan for their bravery, sacrifice 
and commitment to our community and wish

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
offer my support for the CARES Act. It is the 
legislation that we need today to fight the ex-
traordinary challenges we are facing. 
At few points in our nation’s history have we 
been faced with a situation as dire as the one 
before us today. This threat is unusual and 
unfamiliar—a virus and the illness it causes— 
but it is as real as every other great crisis 
we’ve faced. 
This pandemic is upending the lives of each 
and every American. Some have died or lost 
loved ones. More have become ill and hos-
pitalized. Many have lost their jobs or shut-
tered their businesses. All of us are agonizing 
over the uncertainty of a threat we do not fully 
understand and cannot yet defeat. 
The public health crisis has put Americans 
on edge and strained our medical facilities to 
the breaking point. It has also led to unex-
pected economic crises for tens of millions of 
Americans, as businesses are forced to close, 
paychecks are disappearing, and economic 
activity is reduced. 
The size and scope of this aid package is 
staggering, but it reflects the devastating costs 
in lives, jobs, businesses, and economic paral-
ysis that this crisis has brought. It is essential 
that we continue to act quickly and forcefully, 
at all levels of government, to prevent the 
harm and disruption of this crisis from over-
whelming our capacity to help one another. 
The CARES Act provides the foundation for 
that action. The CARES Act will help Ameri-
cans meet these intertwined emergencies by 
providing funds to hospitals and frontline med-
ical providers, expanding and accelerating as-
sistance for Americans that have lost their 
jobs, and providing a lifeline to businesses try-
ing to stay afloat and pay their employees 
while their customers are asked to remain at 
home. 
While we see the clear and overwhelming 
costs that this health crisis is imposing in 
places like Seattle, New York, and New Orle-
ans, it is imposing heavy costs other parts of 
America, as well. Particularly in rural commu-
nities, where the challenges to providing 
health care are magnified by a lack of re-
sources, technology, and specialists, and com-
pounded by extended distances and an older 
population. 
Similarly, the economic crisis created by this 
pandemic is hitting farm country particularly 
hard, which was already suffering long before 
this virus emerged. Agricultural producers are 
particularly sensitive to disruptions in trade, 
supply chains, transportation, and reliable 
sources labor, each of which this pandemic is 
placing under increasing strain. 
This legislation includes essential resources 
which will provide the Secretary of Agriculture 
with the tools he needs to help our nation’s 
farmers and ranchers survive, and to support 
our rural communities, hospitals, and busi-
nesses who are struggling just like their urban 
counterparts. I am grateful that we were able 
to include them, and that we did not ignore the 
unique challenges of rural America. 
As we all know, no legislation is perfect. 
Each member in this body has opinions on 
what tools and funding are needed to respond 
to this crisis which were not included in this 
package. On some priorities, members have 
fundamental, deep-seated differences of opin-
ion; on others, we simply ran out of time to 
find agreement. For my part, I had hoped for 
more funds to help our agricultural producers 
and rural communities as they grapple with 
the crisis as it inevitably moves into less popu-
lated communities. 
On that issue—how we support rural com-
munities during this crisis—the differences be-
tween Republicans and progressive Demo-
crats are profound. Last week, the Senate’s 
proposal included $50 billion for the Depart-
ment of Agriculture. These funds were to be 
available to the Department to address not 
only the coronavirus crisis, but also to con-
tinue the critical farm safety net programs in 
the farm bill. These programs help farmers 
weather the day-to-day uncertainties of farm-
ing and endure the hostile trade actions of for-
eign nations, challenges which the current cri-
sis has moved out of the spotlight, but not off 
the stage. 
On Sunday, the Speaker and her allies in-
troduced their proposal, which included a 
pricey wish list of progressive initiatives, but 
not one dollar for the Department of Agri-
culture to respond to this pandemic. One 
might have called it an oversight, but all this 
week she has fought for her position and 
today, we see the results of that effort: just 
$23.5 billion in funding set aside for agricul-
tural producers, significantly less than what is 
needed. 
The Speaker and her allies claim they 
fought to put workers first, but their demands 
did not include those who work in agriculture. 
In the final analysis, their handiwork short-
changed middle America and has made it 
more difficult to provide our farmers and 
ranchers the help that they so desperately 
need. 
But we cannot delay this package any fur-
ther over our differences. We must move for-
ward with our many areas of agreement, in-
cluding the support that was agreed to for our 
agricultural producers. As we develop any ad-
ditional legislation, I will continue to fight to en-
sure that sufficient resources are available to 
the Department to meet all the challenges 
faced by rural America. 
Despite the circumstances we presently find 
ourselves in as a nation, I have unbounded 
hope for our future. In my own lifetime, I have 
seen our nation rise to meet challenges that 
seemed insurmountable at the time. Looking 
back further in history, we see burdens that 
our ancestors bore that seem unfathomable to 
us today. Overcoming adversity is in our DNA. 
Our capacity as Americans to care for one 
another is immeasurable. All across our coun-
try, families, neighbors, churches, businesses, 
civic clubs, and groups of Americans of all 
stripes are quietly coming together to figure 
out what they can do to help. Our farmers and 
ranchers, and everyone involved in producing, 
transporting, and selling food, fiber, and fuel, 
are no exception. These men and women are 
working overtime because they understand the 
way they can best serve their fellow Ameri-
cans is to prevent disruptions to the food and 
goods that we all need to survive. 
But no group of Americans can tackle this 
crisis alone. While we should all do our part, 
this legislation will do the things that individ-
uals are unable to do for one another. It will 
fund research and buy medical equipment, it 
will safeguard paychecks and families, and it 
will shelter small businesses and essential in-
dustries. Most importantly, it will provide a 
path out of this crisis. 
We are a country of survivors, and I have 
great confidence in our ability to re-emerge 
from this crisis stronger than ever before. I be-
lieve that the CARES Act will help us do that 
and I urge my colleagues to support its pas-
sage.

Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today

He began his career as a patrol officer in 
June 1989 and was a 31-year veteran with the 
Phoenix Police Department. He is the first 
Phoenix Police Commander to lose his life in 
the line of duty. He was a well-respected lead-

family during this time of mourning.
