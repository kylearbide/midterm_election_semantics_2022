HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
STEVEN SPICKELMIER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in honor of the memory of 
Steven Spickelmier who passed away 
at the age of 77 after a long battle with 
COVID–19. 
Steve was a U.S. Navy and Air Na-
tional Guard veteran, retiring as a 
master sergeant after 26 years of mili-
tary service. His unmatched energy 
and positive impact on servicemen, 
veterans, and their families throughout 
northeast Florida displayed his incred-
ible servant’s heart. 
Among Steve’s many local roles, he 
served as chairman of the Veterans 
Council of Duval County and chairman 
of the Support Committee at Jackson-
ville 
National 
Cemetery, 
Madam 
Speaker, where he championed the an-
nual Wreaths Across America program 
and the Memorial Day service. He was 
president of the Air Force Sergeants 
Association, Chapter 559, and field op-
erations director for Florida’s Missing 
in America project. 
Steve 
attended 
Mandarin 
United 
Methodist Church and, among many 
other roles, he served as a church van 
driver for residents of a nearby retire-
ment home to ensure all could worship 
together each Sunday. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, I offer con-
dolences to all who knew and loved 
Steve, especially his wife Glenda, the 
love of his life, for over 33 years.

H3748 
March 16, 2022 
PLANES FOR UKRAINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. And I rise today 
with a very simple message: Those who 
believe that if we leave the world 
alone, the world will leave us alone are 
entirely wrong. 
Madam Speaker, the world would 
find its way to our door as it has done 
so now with Ukraine. 
I had the honor of hearing the Presi-
dent of Ukraine speak this morning, 
and if there is something I came away 
with without question it is this: It is 
that this war is about more than 
Ukraine. It is about freedom-loving 
people wherever they may be. It is 
about people who will not tolerate see-
ing women and babies being killed live 
on television. It is about a belief that if 
you can do something to end an injus-
tice, you have to do it. 
This is why I rise today to say, 
Madam Speaker, that if there is a vote 
for planes for Ukraine, I will vote to 
support planes for Ukraine. And I will 
do so because I believe that this is 
needed for their defense. 
While some would say: But the de-
fense currently would not be planes be-
cause they don’t have to fight planes— 
that they are using long-range projec-
tiles to bomb Ukraine—my point is 
this: Let’s not wait until the skies over 
Ukraine have been darkened with Rus-
sian planes before we send the help 
that they need. 
I don’t mind the world knowing that 
we are part of this. I don’t think we 
can allow a standard to be set such 
that in the future the precedent is if 
you send in planes you are escalating. 
I think if we send in planes, we are 
meeting the challenge that is nec-
essary to defend Ukraine. 
Again, those who believe that if we 
leave the world alone it will leave us 
alone are entirely wrong. This is about 
liberty and justice for all; government 
of the people, by the people, and for the 
people of Ukraine and the rest of us as 
well. This is about freedom-loving peo-
ple wherever they may be. 
If there is a vote for planes, then I 
will vote for planes for Ukraine. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, when I 
travel around the Sixth Congressional 
District of Virginia, folks regularly 
share their struggles with me in the 
face of President Biden’s inflation cri-
sis, economic crisis, and energy crisis. 
They tell me that their hearts sink 
when they check out at the grocery 
store and see the price on the screen 
tick well past what they used to pay to 
feed their families. They tell me they 
dread going to the gas station because 
every time they drive by, they see 
prices getting higher and higher. They 
pray their car doesn’t break down be-
cause they can’t afford to fix it or re-
place it given the rise in the cost of car 
parts. 
They worry about their kids hitting 
a growth spurt because new clothes are 
just getting too expensive. And they 
tell me the disappointment they felt 
when they let their kids know that the 
vacation they had been looking for-
ward to had to be canceled or scaled 
back because the rising cost of flying 
and lodging made it nearly impossible. 
Madam Speaker, folks in rural parts 
of this country are struggling, and 40- 
year high inflation rates serve as a tax 
on all Americans. It is unacceptable 
that the soaring price of goods cost the 
average family $3,500 last year. 
If Members of Congress truly want to 
provide relief to their constituents, 
then they must rein in spending and 
cut taxes to get our country’s economy 
back on track. 
CAVE SPRING BASKETBALL 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Cave Spring High 
School boys’ basketball team from Ro-
anoke, Virginia, for winning this year’s 
class 3 State championship. Following 
a near perfect season, the Cave Spring 
Knights were crowned sole State cham-
pions this year after being named co- 
winners with Lakeland in 2020 due to 
the COVID pandemic. 
From the moment last week’s final 
tipped off against the Petersburg Crim-
son Wave, it was a great showing from 
both teams. 
After 
an 
impressive 
second-half 
comeback by Petersburg, Cave Spring 
was down by 2 with only 1 minute and 
45 seconds left on the clock. A quick 
Knight’s basket tied the game, and the 
Crimson Wave took possession as the 
seconds passed by. But a timely steal 
by Cave Spring’s senior guard, Owyn 
Dawyot, gave the Knights one last 
chance. 
As Dawyot headed toward the basket, 
he was fouled sending him to the free- 
throw line with just 3 seconds left. 
After missing the first shot, the pres-
sure was on, but he kept his cool and 
made the second shot for the final 
score of the game. 
The Knights prevailed, winning 76–75, 
marking the program’s fifth State title 
and the second under Coach Jacob 
Gruse. 
Congratulations to Cave Spring on 
this hard-fought win. It was well- 
earned. 
RECOGNIZING VIRGINIA’S LIEUTENANT 
GOVERNOR WINSOME SEARS 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, as we 
celebrate Women’s History Month, we 
recognize the list of women who have 
contributed to moving the United 
States forward over the past 244 years. 
I rise today to recognize one trail-
blazer in particular, Virginia’s current 
Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Sears. 
Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Lieutenant 
Governor Sears moved to the United 
States at the age of 6 and has since 
dedicated her life to serving others and 
her country. 
Outside of politics, she ran a home-
less shelter, provided ministry to pris-
oners, and spent 3 years wearing our 
Nation’s uniform in the Marine Corps. 
It was also an honor to serve with 
Lieutenant Governor Sears in the Vir-
ginia House of Delegates. 
Since entering public office, Lieuten-
ant Governor Sears has served as a 
Presidential appointee to the United 
States Census Bureau, as a distin-
guished member of the Advisory Com-
mittee on Women Veterans to the 
United States Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs, as the vice president of the 
Virginia State Board of Education, 
and, as I mentioned, as a delegate in 
the Virginia General Assembly. 
Upon her swearing-in on January 15 
of this year, she became the first fe-
male veteran to serve as Lieutenant 
Governor of Virginia and the first 
Black woman to hold statewide office 
in the Commonwealth. 
We applaud the Lieutenant Gov-
ernor’s lifelong accomplishments and 
thank her for her service to her com-
munity, her Commonwealth, and her 
country. 
f 
HONORING ROSA LUCAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a local leader in public 
health, an exceptional community ad-
vocate, my constituent, and my friend, 
Rosa Lucas. 
I first met Rosa during my freshman 
year at UCLA in 1991 while I was work-
ing at a farmworker health clinic. Ever 
since, I have admired her integrity, hu-
mility, selflessness, and passion for jus-
tice. 
Rosa’s story begins in Los Angeles, 
California, December 7, 1945. She spent 
her childhood in Beverly Hills before 
studying at UCLA-Berkeley and UCLA. 
In 1968, she graduated UCLA with her 
bachelor’s in Spanish languages and 
literature. 
Shortly 
after, 
Rosa 
launched her career as a charge nurse 
of neurosurgical intensive care at the 
UCLA Health Sciences Center, eventu-
ally leading her to become a certified 
nurse practitioner in 1975. 
Ten years later, she settled in our 
desert and began her work in the 
Coachella Valley. 
Throughout her career, Rosa has 
worked 
to 
serve 
the 
poor, 
the 
marginalized, and the underserved. She 
has provided care to those most in need 
at rural and farmworker clinics like El 
Progreso del Desierto, Santa Rosa Del 
Valle 
Medical 
Group, 
Desert 
Hot 
Springs Arthritis and Medical Clinic, 
and the Borrego Springs Community 
Health Foundation. Now she works for 
Eisenhower Health Urgent Care Cen-
ters. 
Rosa truly embodies what it means 
to think globally and act locally. She 
has devoted her life to addressing 
health disparities in our valley and has 
made it her goal to expand access to 
healthcare for our most vulnerable.

H3749 
March 16, 2022 
As a physician, I have seen her dedi-
cation to this mission firsthand. In the 
summer of 1996 during a summer fel-
lowship as a medical student, Rosa 
taught me the well-child exam. I will 
never forget her passion to care for at- 
risk newborns, and I knew then that 
she would be a great partner in the 
fight for health and social justice. 
Sure enough, in 2007 when I returned 
home from medical school, we saw pa-
tients together and provided free med-
ical care to the poorest farmworker 
communities with the Flying Doctors. 
Together, we joined the founding 
board of directors for a new nonprofit 
called Coachella Valley Volunteers in 
Medicine which is the only free clinic 
in the Coachella Valley that provides 
free healthcare to the medically under-
served. In fact, we started the street 
medicine program and launched that in 
order to take care to the people and to 
the homeless under bridges, at the 
parks, and in the homeless camps. 
Wherever they find themselves, we 
took care to them, and she still does 
that. 
b 1015 
In fact, Volunteers in Medicine was 
the first in the valley to implement the 
street medicine model during the pan-
demic. We took tests directly to our 
most vulnerable populations, including 
farmworkers and the homeless. This 
model later grew into a collaborative 
approach to vaccinating at-risk popu-
lations at work sites, schools, church-
es, and local trailer parks. 
On top of that, Rosa feeds the hun-
gry. 
She 
battled 
food 
insecurity 
throughout the pandemic, partnering 
with local organizations to coordinate 
food delivery for the hungry and the 
food insecure, partnering with local 
promotora organizations. 
Rosa’s compassion and incredible 
service have touched every corner of 
our communities. She has transformed 
care delivery in our desert and opened 
doors for many. 
As a member of the clinical faculty 
at CSU San Bernardino, Palm Desert, 
and the UCR School of Medicine, Rosa 
has helped shape a new generation of 
healthcare providers. She has inspired 
our communities’ young people on the 
advisory boards for the Head Start pro-
grams at Desert Sands Unified School 
District and Coachella Valley Unified 
School District. 
For her outstanding service, Rosa 
has received numerous accolades, in-
cluding the 2019 Senior Inspiration 
Award from Riverside County, and 
most recently, the 2021 Hometown He-
roes Award from the city of Coachella. 
Rosa is relentless in her advocacy 
and never takes no for an answer when 
advocating for the medically under-
served and her patients. 
Rosa has been an incredible adviser 
to me and has had a profound impact 
on the entire Coachella Valley. In fact, 
I respect Rosa because she delivers. 
She delivers her heart, she delivers her 
mind, and she delivers food. She deliv-
ers tests, she delivers vaccines, and she 
delivers healthcare with every inch of 
her soul and body. Rosa delivers herself 
for the people. 
We are all indebted to Rosa because 
she is the person who has led the 
charge for so many years and has been 
a consistent voice. When there was 
none, there was Rosa. When there was 
none, she provided care and delivery. 
On behalf of California’s 36th Con-
gressional District, I thank Rosa for 
her incredible service. I am so privi-
leged to have her in my life, and I am 
honored to call her a friend. 
f 
HOLDING FEDERAL EMPLOYEES 
ACCOUNTABLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HICE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today on behalf of the Amer-
ican taxpayer to clarify that the Fed-
eral workforce exists to serve them, 
not the other way around. 
During the COVID pandemic, Ameri-
cans faced uncertainties as businesses 
literally struggled to survive. While 
these Americans wondered whether or 
not they would receive the next pay-
check, there was one group, Federal 
employees, who did not face these type 
of concerns. To the contrary, since 
President Biden took office, there has 
been a nonstop effort to ensure that 
Federal workers are treated like a pro-
tected, privileged class. 
Democrats like to talk about the 
need to rehabilitate Federal workers 
after the Trump administration’s so- 
called war on civil servants. That is ab-
solutely ridiculous. The Democrats’ 
road to recovery apparently includes 
shielding government workers, workers 
whose positions exist to serve the 
American people. The Democrats want 
to shield government workers from ac-
countability; from any concern of dis-
cipline; from the obligation to actually 
perform the duties that they were 
hired to do; and from their duty to 
serve the elected Representatives of 
the people. 
But guess what? Despite the claims 
of trauma during the Trump adminis-
tration, Federal workers were happier 
during his time in office. Why? Simply 
because the Federal workers were held 
accountable. 
Let’s face it: No one likes working in 
a situation where you can’t do any-
thing about poor performers, where 
you can’t do anything regarding people 
who simply refuse to actually do their 
jobs. The consequences of that type of 
environment is that the actual con-
scientious workers have to pick up the 
slack, which only adds to their own 
workloads and creates an extremely 
toxic work environment. 
Nevertheless, 
Democrats 
want 
to 
continue the false narrative of an 
abused Federal workforce. They want 
to curry favor with the core union con-
stituency by looking for as many ways 
as possible to increase pay and bene-
fits, all under the name of making the 
Federal Government a model employer. 
But model employers hold their 
workforce accountable. Model employ-
ers put the customer first. In this case, 
that is the American taxpayer. We 
don’t hear any of this from the Demo-
crats, but you do from the Republicans. 
Today, along with a number of my 
Republican colleagues, I am intro-
ducing the Accountable Federal Em-
ployees Act, which codifies a suite of 
executive orders that President Trump 
issued, but, unfortunately, President 
Biden has repealed. 
This bill includes a number of com-
monsense provisions, such as making 
sure Federal employees actually do 
their jobs rather than spend time on 
union activities. It makes sure that 
poor performers are held accountable. 
That is something even Federal em-
ployees say is sorely lacking in the 
workplace. It creates a process to en-
sure collective bargaining agreements 
are negotiated in a timely manner and 
in a way that looks out for the best in-
terests of the American taxpayer. It 
makes sure that Federal employees in 
policy-making roles actually work to 
help implement the policies of the peo-
ple who were actually elected to office. 
This bill represents a platform of 
sanity and fairness in civil service pol-
icy and in the workforce of the Federal 
Government. Frankly, any serious ef-
fort to modernize the Federal work-
force has to start with ensuring the 
best possible level of service for the 
American people. That is what this bill 
does. I urge my colleagues to join me 
in this effort. 
f 
MAKING HEALTHCARE MORE 
AFFORDABLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to celebrate our Na-
tion’s actions to make healthcare more 
affordable. Together, we provided more 
resources for the CDC and State and 
local health departments to ensure 
they are prepared and equipped, imple-
menting lessons learned from the pan-
demic. 
We 
confronted 
our 
most 
urgent 
health crises while taking strides to re-
duce unacceptable health disparities. 
We invested in our veterans, focusing 
on the mental health needs of those 
who served our Nation. 
We 
strengthened 
biomedical 
re-
search, providing more funding for the 
National Institutes of Health and es-
tablishing 
the 
Advanced 
Research 
Projects Agency for Health to cure the 
previously uncurable. We protected the 
safety of our food and medicine by 
funding the FDA. 
The pandemic taught us that no one 
is safe unless everyone is safe. That is 
why we increased funding for global 
health, to work to prevent the next 
pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3750 
March 16, 2022 
With this budget, Democrats are not 
only making healthcare more afford-
able for all Americans; we are building 
a healthier and safer Nation. 
HELPING WORKING FAMILIES WITH THE COST OF 
LIVING 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to highlight the signifi-
cant investments we enacted to help 
working families with the cost of liv-
ing. 
In a time of great uncertainty and 
change, people are living paycheck to 
paycheck or on fixed incomes. Many 
are struggling just to pay basic bills. 
Our investments represent a lifeline 
for working families. By increasing 
funding for childcare, public schools, 
and providing high-quality job train-
ing, this bill gives more tools to help 
Americans succeed. 
Government must serve the people, 
not the biggest corporations. We pro-
vided resources to small businesses and 
entrepreneurs 
as 
they 
pursue 
the 
American Dream. We invested to con-
nect communities to the internet and 
expand access to affordable housing 
and homeownership. We strengthened 
our core services and tackled the root 
causes of rising prices. 
One example is by providing $158 mil-
lion to support the production and de-
livery of small- to medium-size manu-
facturers, helping detangle the supply 
chain and lower costs to consumers. We 
paid for it by cracking down on big cor-
porations and the wealthiest who are 
not paying their fair share. This gov-
ernment funding legislation truly de-
livers for the people. 
f 
OUR SENIORS NEED HELP NOW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. LARSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, Martin Luther King famously 
said in a speech in Memphis that there 
is always a need to act, but especially, 
as he noted there at the time, with the 
fierce urgency of now. 
The fierce urgency of now, as it re-
lates to Social Security, has been un-
derscored by a global pandemic, a glob-
al pandemic that has hit the world and 
our country especially hard. 
More than 940,000 Americans have 
lost their lives. Of those who have per-
ished, over 700,000 of them are over age 
65. I bring this to the attention of the 
body because COVID has specifically 
underscored a problem that existed 
amongst our elderly before the out-
break of this international pandemic. 
Over 700,000 over the age of 65 have 
died. This is the same group that is 
worse hit by the effects of inflation. 
As you know, Madam Speaker, every-
body who is on a fixed income and has 
to marshal their resources understands 
how inflation can be crippling. All the 
more reason that we need to provide 
relief, and relief is on the way. Relief is 
on the way with the Social Security 
2100: A Sacred Trust Act, currently in 
the process of being marked up in the 
Ways and Means Committee. 
Our seniors need our help now, as 
they struggle both with COVID and as 
they struggle being on a fixed income. 
The last time that the United States 
Congress did anything to enhance So-
cial Security was more than 51 years 
ago. Richard Nixon was the President 
of the United States, and the cost of a 
gallon of milk was 72 cents. 
A lot has transpired since then, but 
what hasn’t taken place is Congress 
and its responsibility to make sure 
that Social Security keeps pace with 
the changes that are needed. The last 
time Congress did anything substantial 
with Social Security was 39 years ago, 
in 1983. It increased the solvency, but it 
did so by cutting benefits and taxing 
the elderly. 
Social Security 2100 seeks to enhance 
benefits, that hasn’t been done in more 
than 50 years, and eliminate a burden-
some tax on people who have to work 
after they have retired in order to 
make ends meet. 
I want to especially commend the 
Congressional Black Caucus and Mr. 
CLYBURN for their efforts in this area, 
underscoring, again, and knowing what 
happens to people of color. 
As Mr. CLYBURN so eloquently says: 
Not only is it people of color, but peo-
ple in rural America. All across the 
South and all across this country, rural 
Americans are forced to live on fixed 
incomes that haven’t been adjusted in 
more than 50 years. In the midst of 
COVID and this inflation, they are the 
ones who are hurt the most. 
Congress can no longer afford to kick 
the can down the road and, once again, 
not address the preeminent program 
that prevents the elderly from living in 
poverty and the preeminent program 
that prevents children from living in 
poverty. It is time for Congress to act. 
It is our responsibility to do so. 
As the chair of the Subcommittee on 
Social Security on the Ways and Means 
Committee, I am proud that Chairman 
NEAL and our membership are moving 
this legislation forward and onto the 
floor. It wouldn’t happen without the 
best efforts put forward by Members of 
the Congressional Black Caucus, and I 
commend JOYCE BEATTY for her efforts 
as well.

FARM BILL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARTER of Louisiana). The Chair recog-
nizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. 
MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, in prepara-
tion for reauthorizing the farm bill in 
2023, I rise today to deliver the fifth in-
stallment of my farm bill impact series 
where I am highlighting various as-
pects of the farm bill that deserve Con-
gress’ awareness and support. 
If America is going to thrive, the 
people who feed, fuel, and clothe Amer-
ica must thrive. 
The farm bill strengthens our coun-
try’s 
national 
security 
because 
it 
strengthens our food security by sup-
porting the tireless efforts of farmers, 
ranchers, and our agricultural pro-
ducers. 
Agriculture is a risky business, and 
Mother Nature can be a tough business 
partner. Almost no other American in-
dustry faces such volatility from forces 
like pests, disease, wind, drought, and 
fires like the ones in Reno County, 
Kansas, and Paradise, Kansas, over the 
last few months. 
Natural disasters are make-or-break 
situations for the people who ensure 
that America remains the most food 
secure country in the world. That is 
why emergency programs within the 
farm bill are so critical. 
The Livestock Indemnity Program 
and the Emergency Assistance for 
Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm- 
Raised Fish provide benefits to pro-
ducers for livestock deaths caused by 
disease and adverse weather. 
A veterinarian from Ashland, Kansas, 
told me that during the Starbuck fire 
back in 2017, to which he was an emer-
gency responder, Clark County, Kan-
sas, alone lost 6,000 to 9,000 head of cat-
tle right at the beginning of calving 
season. 
One producer suffered $1.8 million in 
cattle losses during this disaster. The 
Livestock Indemnity Program helped 
producers who lost cattle in this dis-
aster put their livelihoods back to-
gether. 
However, LIP only covered cattle 
mortality at the time, not severely in-
jured cattle. Rather than watch badly 
injured cattle get euthanized just to 
trigger LIP program payments, this 
veterinarian helped make changes to 
the program that are still in place 
today which provide better protection 
for producers and their livestock. 
These programs, and many more, are 
investments in the future of our coun-
try, and they must remain strong in 
the 2023 farm bill if America is going to 
remain food secure and self-deter-
mining as a Nation. 
Natural 
disasters, 
diseases, 
and 
weather emergencies, unfortunately, 
do happen, and America cannot afford 
to have these factors cripple the busi-
nesses of the men and women who keep 
us fed, fueled, and clothed. 
That is why we need to think care-
fully and critically about the degrees 
to which we support emergency pro-
grams within the 2023 farm bill. 
I will be back on the floor soon to de-
liver another installment of my farm 
bill impact series and highlight more 
programs and titles within the bill that 
Congress must understand and support 
to ensure that agriculture thrives in 
America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3751 
March 16, 2022 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, as 
we celebrate the bipartisan fiscal year 
2022 appropriations bill becoming law, I 
am proud to have secured over $10 mil-
lion to fund 10 projects in communities 
across northern Illinois. 
These essential projects will reduce 
wait times for mental healthcare, up-
grade infrastructure to ensure clean 
water, make college more affordable 
and accessible, support foster youth 
and families, and strengthen local 
emergency response and community 
safety. 
Last summer, I visited many of the 
organizations 
that 
sponsor 
these 
projects to learn more about how these 
funds will impact Illinoisans. Independ-
ence Health & Therapy will receive 
$60,000 to expand tele-psychiatry hours 
and reduce wait times for mental 
health services in McHenry County. 
The DeKalb County Regional Office 
of Education will receive $150,000 to ex-
pand the work of the DeKalb County 
Kindergarten Readiness Collaborative 
and provide quality early learning op-
portunities to residents of Sandwich, 
Sycamore, and Hinckley. 
The Lake County Stormwater Man-
agement Commission will receive near-
ly $1.4 million to prevent impending 
dam failure of the Sylvan Lake Dam 
and protect nearly 500 homes from 
flooding and damage. 
The Kendall County CASA Program 
will receive $200,000 to establish a 
CASA clubhouse which will serve the 
growing foster youth population by 
providing a free, safe location for fami-
lies to meet during court-ordered visi-
tation. 
McHenry County College will receive 
$825,000 to expand dual credit and dual 
degree programs, offering low-cost col-
lege credits to high schoolers across 
McHenry County. 
The Wauconda Fire Protection Dis-
trict will receive $36,000 to replace a 28- 
year-old natural gas emergency backup 
generator to power the fire station’s 
emergency operations center, which 
provides essential services to the 40,000 
residents in Lake and McHenry Coun-
ties. 
And over $7.5 million is being di-
rected to critical water infrastructure 
projects to ensure safe, clean, and sus-
tainable drinking water for residents of 
Joliet, Pingree Grove, and Richmond. 
From day one, I have worked hard to 
bring the voices of the 14th District to 
Congress. And as a member of the 
House Committee on Appropriations, I 
will continue to ensure that our com-
munities’ priorities are reflected with-
in Federal funding. 
These projects will create jobs and 
improve the well-being of our commu-
nities, and I am so proud to deliver this 
$10.5 million investment to my con-
stituents. 
This month, the House passed the bi-
partisan Honoring our PACT Act which 
would expand healthcare for 3.5 million 
veterans exposed to toxic substances 
during their service. 
As a member of the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee, and an original co-sponsor 
of the bill, I am proud to champion this 
historic legislation. 
Simply put, the Honoring our PACT 
Act is a full accounting for the true 
cost of war. When our servicemembers 
signed up to defend our country and 
our freedoms, we made a promise to 
care for them when they returned 
home. For too long, we failed to keep 
that promise. 
By passing this bill, we are upholding 
our end of the pact and ensuring every 
veteran has access to the care they de-
serve. 
The Senate must pass this com-
prehensive toxic exposure legislation 
swiftly. Our veterans deserve nothing 
less.

PROCEEDINGS 
OF 
ADDRESS 
BY 
PRESIDENT 
VOLODYMYR 
ZELENSKYY OF UKRAINE 
The following proceedings were held 
in the Capitol Visitor Center before the 
House convened for morning-hour de-
bate: 
ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR 
ZELENSKYY OF UKRAINE 
The SPEAKER. Good morning. Good 
morning, Mr. President. Good morning, 
Madam Ambassador, who is with us 
this 
morning, 
Madam 
Ambassador 
Markarova. 
Mr. President, it is my honor to 
present to you the Congress of the 
United States, which has great respect 
and admiration and appreciation for 
your courageous leadership. 
Members of Congress, I have the high 
privilege and distinct honor of pre-
senting 
to 
you 
the 
President 
of 
Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
My colleagues, Slava Ukraini. Glory 
to Heroes. 
(Applause, the Members rising.) 
President ZELENSKYY (Speaking in 
Ukrainian). Thank you very much. 
Madam Speaker, Members of the Con-
gress, ladies and gentlemen, Ameri-
cans, friends, I am proud to greet you 
from Ukraine, from our capital city of 
Kyiv, a city that is under missile and 
airstrikes from Russian troops every 
day, but it doesn’t give up. And we 
have not even thought about it for a 
second, just like many other cities and 
communities in our beautiful country 
which found themselves in the worst 
war since World War II. 
I have the honor to greet you on be-
half of the Ukrainian people, brave and 
freedom-loving people who, for 8 years, 
have been resisting the Russian aggres-
sion; those who give their best sons and 
daughters to stop this full-scale Rus-
sian invasion. 
Right now, the destiny of our coun-
try is being decided, the destiny of our 
people, whether Ukrainians will be 
free, whether they will be able to pre-
serve their democracy. 
Russia has attacked not just us, not 
just our land, not just our cities. It 
went on a brutal offensive against our 
values, basic human values. 
It threw tanks and planes against our 
freedom, against our right to live free-
ly in our own country, choosing our 
own future; against our desire for hap-
piness; against our national dreams, 
just like the same dreams you have, 
you, Americans, just like anyone else 
in the United States. 
I remember your national memorial 
at Mount Rushmore, the faces of your 
prominent Presidents, those who laid 
the foundation of the United States of 
America as it is today: democracy; 
independence; freedom; and care for ev-
eryone, for every person, for everyone 
who works diligently, who lives hon-
estly, who respects the law. We in 
Ukraine want the same for our people. 
All that is a normal part of your own 
life. 
Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Amer-
icans: In your great history, you have 
pages that would allow you to under-
stand Ukrainians. Understand us now, 
when we need you right now. 
Remember Pearl Harbor, the terrible 
morning of December 7, 1941, when 
your sky was black from the planes at-
tacking you. Just remember it. 
Remember September 11, a terrible 
day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your 
cities and independent territories into 
battlefields, when innocent people were 
attacked from the air, yes. Just like 
nobody else expected it, you could not 
stop it. 
Our country experiences the same 
every day. Right now, at this moment, 
every night for 3 weeks now, in various 
Ukrainian 
cities: 
Odessa, 
Kharkiv, 
Chernihiv, 
Sumy, 
Zhytomyr, 
Vinnytsya, Mariupol, and Dnipro. Rus-
sia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a 
source of death for thousands of people. 
Russian troops have already fired 
nearly 1,000 missiles at Ukraine, count-
less bombs. They use drones to kill us 
with precision. This is a terror that 
Europe has not seen for 80 years, and 
we are asking for a reply, for an answer 
to this terror from the whole world. 
Is this a lot to ask for, to create a no- 
fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is 
this too much to ask, a humanitarian 
no-fly zone, something that Russia 
would not be able to terrorize our free 
cities? 
If this is too much to ask, we offer an 
alternative. You know what kind of de-
fense systems we need, S–300 and other 
similar systems. You know how much 
depends on the battlefield, on the abil-
ity to use aircraft, powerful, strong 
aviation to protect our people, our 
freedom, our land, aircraft that can 
help Ukraine help Europe. And you 
know that they exist, and you have 
them, but they are on Earth, not in the 
Ukrainian sky. They do not defend our 
people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3752 
March 16, 2022 
‘‘I have a dream.’’ These words are 
known to each of you. Today, I can say, 
I have a need. I need to protect our 
sky. I need your decision, your help, 
which means exactly the same, the 
same you feel when you hear the 
words, ‘‘I have a dream.’’ 
Ladies 
and 
gentlemen, 
friends, 
Ukraine is grateful to the United 
States for its overwhelming support for 
everything that your government and 
your people have done for us: for weap-
ons and ammunition; for training; for 
finances; for leadership in the free 
world, which helps us to pressure the 
aggressor economically. 
I am grateful to President Biden for 
his personal involvement, for his sin-
cere commitment to the defense of 
Ukraine and democracy all over the 
world. I am grateful to you for the res-
olution which recognizes all those who 
commit 
crimes 
against 
Ukraine, 
against the Ukrainian people, as war 
criminals. 
However, now, it is true, in the dark-
est time for our country, for the whole 
Europe, I call on you to do more. New 
packages of sanctions are needed con-
stantly, every week until the Russian 
military machine stops. 
Restrictions are needed for everyone 
on whom this unjust regime is based. 
We propose that the United States 
sanction all politicians in the Russian 
Federation who remain in their offices 
and do not cut ties with those who are 
responsible for the aggression against 
Ukraine, from State Duma members to 
the last official who has the lack of 
morals to break the state terror. 
All American companies must leave 
Russia from their market. Leave their 
market immediately because it is 
flooded with our blood. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Members of 
Congress, please take the lead. If you 
have companies in your districts who 
finance the Russian military machine 
leaving business in Russia, you should 
put pressure. I am asking to make sure 
that the Russians do not receive a sin-
gle penny that they use to destroy peo-
ple in Ukraine, the destruction of our 
country, the destruction of Europe. 
All American ports should be closed 
for Russian goods. Peace is more im-
portant than income, and we have to 
defend this principle in the whole 
world. 
We already became part of the 
antiwar coalition, the big antiwar coa-
lition that unites many countries, doz-
ens of countries, those who reacted in 
principle to President Putin’s decision 
to invade our country. But we need to 
move on and do more. 
We need to create new tools to re-
spond quickly and stop the war, the 
full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, 
which began on February 24. And it 
would be fair if it ended in a day, in 24 
hours, that evil would be punished im-
mediately. 
Today, the world does not have such 
tools. The wars of the past have 
prompted our predecessors to create in-
stitutions that should protect us from 
war, but they, unfortunately, don’t 
work. We see it; you see it. So, we need 
new ones, new institutions, new alli-
ances, and we offer them. 
We propose to create an association. 
U24, United for Peace, a union of re-
sponsible 
countries 
that 
have 
the 
strength and consciousness to stop con-
flicts immediately, to provide all the 
necessary assistance in 24 hours: if nec-
essary, even weapons; if necessary, 
sanctions, humanitarian support, polit-
ical support, finances, everything you 
need to keep the peace and quickly 
save the world to save lives. 
In addition, such an association, such 
a union, could provide assistance to 
those who are experiencing natural dis-
asters, man-made disasters, who fall 
victim 
to 
humanitarian 
crises 
or 
epidemics. Remember how difficult it 
was for the world to do the simplest 
thing just to give vaccines, vaccines 
against COVID, to save lives, to pre-
vent new strains. The world spent 
months, years, doing things like that 
much faster to make sure there are no 
human losses, no victims. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Americans, if 
such an alliance would exist today— 
that is, U24—we would be able to save 
thousands of lives in our country, in 
many countries of the world, those who 
need peace, those who suffer inhumane 
destruction. 
I ask you to watch one video, a video 
of what the Russian troops did in our 
country, in our land. We have to stop 
it. We must prevent it, preemptively 
destroy every single aggressor who 
seeks 
to 
subjugate 
other 
nations. 
Please watch the video. 
(Video Presentation.) 
President ZELENSKYY. And in the 
end, to sum it up, today it is not 
enough to be the leader of the nation. 
Today it takes to be the leader of the 
world. Being the leader of the world 
means to be the leader of peace. Peace 
in your country doesn’t depend any-
more only on you and your people. It 
depends on those next to you and those 
who are strong. 
Strong doesn’t mean big. Strong is 
brave and ready to fight for the lives of 
his citizens and citizens of the world; 
for human rights, for freedom, for the 
right to live decently and to die when 
your time comes and not when it is 
wanted by someone else, by your neigh-
bor. 
Today, the Ukrainian people are de-
fending not only Ukraine. We are fight-
ing for the values of Europe and the 
world, sacrificing our lives in the name 
of the future. 
That is why, today, the American 
people are helping not just Ukraine but 
Europe and the world to keep the plan-
et alive, to keep justice in history. 
Now, I am almost 45 years old. 
Today, my age stopped when the hearts 
of more than 100 children stopped beat-
ing. 
I see no sense in life if it cannot stop 
the deaths, and this is my main mis-
sion as the leader of my people, the 
great Ukrainians. And as the leader of 
my nation, I am addressing President 
Biden: You are the leader of the Na-
tion, of your great Nation. I wish you 
to be the leader of the world. Being the 
leader of the world means to be the 
leader of peace. Thank you. 
Slava Ukraini. Glory to Ukraine.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
In You, O Lord our God, we take ref-
uge. Give shelter to those who are pur-
sued this day and deliver them. Rescue 
those whose cities are being torn apart, 
those men, women, and children who 
are being torn away from home and 
hearth, family and security. 
As we consider the adversities of the 
people around the globe, sights of 
which are in such contrast to anything 
we could have possibly imagined or 
considered, call us to arms. 
In addition to the policies we craft, 
the decisions we make, and the nego-
tiations we attempt, we wield the most 
powerful weapon You have given every 
lawmaker and every citizen: our pray-
ers. 
So, Lord, in Your mercy, hear our 
prayers. Rise up, O Lord, in Your 
anger. Lift Yourself up against the fury 
of the enemies. Exact Your judgment 
on those who conceive evil, who give 
birth to disillusionment. Let the evil of 
the wicked come to an end. 
Then by Your grace, establish the 
righteous. Provide deep resolve and 
faithfulness in the hearts of the per-
secuted that they would remain strong 
in You. 
Be their shield. Save the upright in 
heart and preserve the innocent from 
harm. 
O Lord most high, we depend on Your 
righteousness. And in the strength of 
Your name, we pray. 
Amen.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
CREATE A RESPECTFUL AND 
OPEN WORLD FOR NATURAL HAIR 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the CROWN Act, Cre-
ating a Respectful and Open World for 
Natural Hair, H.R. 2116, which I urge 
this body to pass this Friday in the 
House. 
I stand in support for all the girls and 
women who need the freedom to be who 
God made them, to be their beautiful 
selves from the tips of their toes to 
every twist, wave, and coil of their 
beautiful hair. 
Fifty-three percent of Black mothers, 
whose daughters have experienced hair 
discrimination, say their daughters ex-
perienced the discrimination as early 
as 5 years old. 
Eighty-six percent of Black teens 
who have experienced hair discrimina-
tion state that they experienced it by 
the age of 12. Trauma means that teen-
age girls are missing a week of school 
per year due to their hair dissatisfac-
tion. 
As a small girl, I remember after 
school telling my mother about a man 
joking 
about 
my 
perfectly 
coifed, 
round Afro. Her lioness reaction gave 
me the strength to endure micro-
aggressions I received when I wore my 
hair in locs, then cornrows or braids as 
an adult. 
These biases continue to perpetuate 
unfair scrutiny, and I stand and ask 
you all to stand with me for my daugh-
ter and for others like her to be their 
most glorious selves. 
f 
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY IS A WAR 
HERO 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I was grateful to at-
tend the joint session of Congress 
today to hear directly from the valiant 
Ukrainian 
President, 
Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy. He is a world hero for free-
dom and democracy. 
Courageous Ukrainians will always 
be cherished as they protect rule of law 
over rule by gun by authoritarians in a 
worldwide conflict. 
On Tuesday, President Zelenskyy 
clarified the war is not against Russian 
citizens. Putin is the mass murderer. 
President Zelenskyy called for Russian 
soldiers to surrender, and I have of-
fered a bipartisan bill in Congress to 
reward Russian defectors with expe-
dited refugee status to the United 
States, with up to $100,000 for Russian 
equipment turned over to Ukraine. 
In the congressional address today, 
President 
Zelenskyy 
cited 
Mount 
Rushmore for its busts of American 
Founders, and I have a bipartisan bill 
in Congress for a bust of President 
Zelenskyy to be placed in the U.S. Cap-
itol, in the tradition of Churchill, 
Havel, and Kossuth. 
God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. 
Long live President Zelenskyy. 
f 
SALUTING THE PEOPLE OF 
UKRAINE 
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, this 
morning, Members of Congress, Demo-
crats and Republicans, House and Sen-
ate, had the high privilege and distinct 
honor of hearing directly from the 
President 
of 
Ukraine, 
Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy. 
In the face of Russia’s cruel and 
unprovoked invasion, the President’s 
fearless, heroic leadership has rallied 
his Nation and inspired the entire 
world. 
Our Members were very moved by his 
powerful remarks today, as well as the 
heart-wrenching 
footage 
he 
shared 
showing Putin’s inhumane terror, bru-
tally committing war crimes against 
children. 
As President Zelenskyy said: ‘‘Right 
now, the destiny of our country is 
being decided . . . Russia has attacked 
not just us, not just our land, not just 
our cities. It went on a brutal offensive 
against our values—basic human val-
ues.’’ 
Indeed, all are in awe of the extraor-
dinary courage and determination of 
the Ukrainian people as they defend de-
mocracy, not only at home but democ-
racy around the world. 
It is with great respect for the 
Ukrainian people, and in recognition of 
the grave threat that Russian aggres-
sion poses to the free world, that Con-
gress secured $13.6 billion in humani-
tarian, security, and economic assist-
ance for Ukraine in the government 
funding 
law 
that 
President 
Biden 
signed yesterday. 
But more needs to be done for the 
refugees and for the protection of the 
people. I hope that all of this can be 
done in a bipartisan way. 
So I join my colleague in saluting the 
people of Ukraine. Slava Ukraini. That 
means ‘‘Glory to Ukraine.’’ Glory to 
the heroes of Ukraine. 
Madam Speaker, and in coordination with 
the Administration and our Allies, we have 
taken strong, bipartisan action to cripple and 
isolate the Russian economy: 
Strangling its banks and taking on the 
oligarchs funding this war; 
Banning the import of oil and energy prod-
ucts into the United States, cutting off the life-
blood of the Russian economy; 
Taking first steps to remove Russia from the 
WTO; and 
Reauthorizing Global Magnitsky so we can 
impose further sanctions. 
This week, the House will take our latest, 
most intense action yet: revoking the privilege 
of permanent normal trade relations from Rus-
sia. 
It is my hope that, when it comes to the 
floor, this legislation receives overwhelming bi-
partisan support, worthy of the valor and her-
oism of the Ukrainian people.

CONGRATULATING THE LUMPKIN 
COUNTY LADY INDIANS BASKET-
BALL TEAM 
(Mr. CLYDE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the 2022 Georgia 
High School Association 3A State 
champions, the Lumpkin County Lady 
Indians girls’ basketball team. 
After trailing behind in the third 
quarter, the Lady Indians defeated the 
Greater Atlanta Spartans girls’ basket-
ball team 51–47, winning their 28th con-
secutive game and securing their first 
championship title in school history. 
These talented young women, led by 
head coach David Dowse, fought till 
the 
very 
end, 
showing 
incredible 
athleticism, strength, and determina-
tion. 
Congratulations 
to 
the 
Lumpkin 
County Lady Indians girls’ basketball 
team on a spectacular win and an ex-
citing new title. Georgia’s Ninth Dis-
trict is proud of them.

Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I

coffee, Starbucks. 
Since I last spoke on the floor, a cou-
ple things have changed. The $20 mil-
lion man, Kevin Johnson, has resigned. 
I think that is a good thing. Now, How-

NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS 
DEVELOPMENT CENTER DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate National Small Business Devel-
opment Center Day. SBDC Day unites 
nearly 1,000 Small Business Develop-
ment Centers across the country and 
the hundreds of thousands of clients 
they serve. 
Pennsylvania is lucky to have 16 
SBDCs across our Commonwealth, and 
they are ready to assist entrepreneurs 
and small business owners with the 
knowledge and tools needed to make 
smart decisions and prosper. 
The Pennsylvania SBDCs are a pub-
lic-private partnership with the U.S. 
Small Business Administration, the 
Pennsylvania Department of Commu-
nity and Economic Development, and 
16 universities and colleges. 
Small Business Development Centers 
are there to provide resources for en-
trepreneurs of all ages and back-
grounds, from underserved commu-
nities to veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I grew up working 
for my family’s small sporting goods 
business. I know firsthand the drive, 
dedication, and determination it takes 
to succeed. 
If you are a small business owner, en-
trepreneur, or are looking to get start-
ed, be sure to check out a Small Busi-
ness Development Center near you.

ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, 
last week marked the 1-year anniver-
sary of the passage of the American 
Rescue Plan. 
The American Rescue Plan was the 
bold and necessary action we needed to 
take to put us on the path of economic 
recovery. This was the boost our coun-
try needed to get shots in arms, Ameri-
cans back to work, and money back in 
the pockets of working families. 
Despite 
unprecedented 
challenges, 
the Biden administration has led our 
Nation to record economic growth, in-
cluding the largest job creation in 
American history. In President Biden’s 
first year, over 7.4 million jobs were 
added to the economy. Also, growth is 
up, wages are up, and unemployment is 
down. But we know we still face infla-
tionary times. 
President Biden and Democrats are 
also acting to fix supply chains and 
taking strong steps to boost competi-
tion, strengthen U.S. manufacturing, 
create good-paying jobs, and lower ev-
eryday costs. We are working towards 
building a better America and deliv-
ering for America’s working families.

BAN HAIR DISCRIMINATION 
THROUGH THE CROWN ACT 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in strong support of the 
CROWN Act. This long-overdue legisla-
tion would finally ban hair discrimina-
tion in schools, in the workplace, and 
in other public spaces. 
No worker should be denied employ-
ment because of their natural hair. No 
child should be sent home from school 
because they choose to wear protective 
hairstyles like Bantu knots or braids. 
Discrimination against Black hair 
has been and always will be a form of 
racism. Every person deserves to be 
their true, authentic self, and crowns 
of all types should be embraced. 
I was proud to wear braids on the day 
of my swearing-in, just as I am proud 
to wear braids as I speak on the House 
floor today. 
It is time to end hair discrimination 
in America. It is time to pass the 
CROWN Act.

Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members be given 5 legislative days

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, the Rules Committee met on 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
979, providing for consideration of H.R. 
963, the FAIR Act, under a structured 
rule. It provides 1 hour of debate equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair 
and ranking member of the Committee 
on the Judiciary. It makes in order one 
amendment and provides one motion to 
recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 2116, the CROWN Act, 
under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the Committee on the Judiciary 
and provides one motion to recommit. 
Madam Speaker, the bills we discuss 
today have to do with fundamental 
American values. 
The first bill under this rule, the 
FAIR Act, simply restores the right of 
individuals to have their day in court.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3755 
March 16, 2022 
It prevents the use of forced arbitra-
tion clauses in consumer and employ-
ment contracts. 
Most likely, all of us have signed a 
contract with a forced arbitration 
clause, and many may not even know 
it. How many Americans have read 
their cell phone contract? How many 
have read their credit card contract? 
Too many consumer contracts are 
written to protect the pockets of cor-
porations, leaving consumers at the 
mercy of a system created by, paid by, 
and focused on minimizing liabilities of 
corporate companies. 
These documents are dozens of pages 
long, and most contain clauses that re-
quire arbitration in case of a legal dis-
pute and prevent the consumer from 
going to court as an alternative. There 
is no negotiation or choice. 
Ask yourselves, if you saw something 
that you objected to in a contract for 
your cell phone, what option do you 
have to change it? The answer is no 
choice at all. 
That is why this is called forced arbi-
tration, and these requirements game 
the system in favor of one party, large 
corporations. If there is a dispute, cor-
porations get to pick the location of 
arbitration, and in many cases, it is 
out of State; pick the arbitrator; and 
pay for them. Yes, the impartial arbi-
trator, who depends on corporate con-
tractors, is paid for by the corporation. 
And corporations get to shield the re-
sults from the public. Imagine that. 
The FAIR Act stops this harmful and 
abusive behavior. It bans forced arbi-
tration clauses in employment, civil 
rights, and consumer disputes. 
Congress just passed legislation that 
changed this process for disputes in-
volving sexual harassment. However, 
there are tens of millions of Americans 
who are still affected by forced arbitra-
tion in other contexts, and this legisla-
tion provides those same protections to 
them as well. 
Ensuring fairness under the law is at 
the center of the second bill being con-
sidered under this rule, the CROWN 
Act. This bill would ensure that dis-
crimination based on race is not 
masked as discrimination about hair-
styles. 
This is legislation that we passed by 
a voice vote last Congress with no ob-
jection from the other side. But this 
year, Republicans decided that some-
thing had changed—not with the legis-
lation, but with their Conference— 
since they objected to the consider-
ation of this bill under suspension. 
The CROWN Act simply clarifies 
what studies have shown, that often-
times 
women, 
particularly 
Black 
women, 
are 
discriminated 
against 
based on their natural hair. 
Courts have rejected previous guid-
ance finding that discrimination on the 
basis of hairstyle or hair texture is a 
violation of the Civil Rights Act. So, 
this legislation simply makes these 
protections clear, that you cannot dis-
criminate on the basis of a person’s 
hair texture or hairstyle if that style 
or texture is commonly associated with 
a particular race or national origin. 
I believe that both of these bills will 
help to make our legal system more 
fair for every single one of us. I urge 
passage of the rule and these bills. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Representative from Cali-
fornia for yielding me the customary 30 
minutes, and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Today, we are here to discuss H.R. 
2116, which would clarify that it is a 
Federal crime to discriminate based on 
an individual’s hair. But we are also 
here to discuss H.R. 963, the FAIR Act, 
which bans arbitration clauses in pri-
vate contracts. 
H.R. 963 makes it clear: The inten-
tion is to remove arbitration as a legal 
tool for the American people while pre-
serving arbitration with an exemption 
for labor unions. The belief is that the 
American 
people 
need 
Washington 
watching over their private contracts. 
I assure you, those in Minnesota’s Sev-
enth District do not need them. 
The bill purports to ban forced arbi-
tration. This is misleading rhetoric. 
Forced or involuntary agreements are 
already illegal. So, what would this bill 
really do? 
It would insert the Federal Govern-
ment into the private contracts of citi-
zens and remove their ability to settle 
disputes outside of the courtroom 
through predispute arbitration agree-
ments. 
This bill pretends to empower plain-
tiffs, but by voiding arbitration clauses 
in the context outlined in the bill, it 
would effectively end most arbitration 
entirely, even when that arbitration 
would benefit those most impacted. 
Because 
the 
bill 
fundamentally 
changes an arbitration clause from a 
mutual commitment to use an alter-
native dispute resolution method into 
a one-sided election for an injured 
party, contracts will be far less likely 
to include the option to arbitrate. 
If parties cannot agree in advance to 
arbitrate, the plaintiff may never have 
access to arbitration. These unintended 
consequences will have real-life impli-
cations, especially for those who lack 
deep pockets and do not have the possi-
bility of a high-dollar settlement that 
some of the more affluent individuals 
do. 
Democrats are also ignoring how ar-
bitration is generally a good way to re-
solve disputes. They seem to assume 
that all arbitration is secret, that arbi-
tration automatically keeps individ-
uals from going to the authorities or 
publicizing 
their 
experiences. 
But 
agreeing to resolve a case outside of 
court is different than agreeing to si-
lence. 
That distinction matters here be-
cause much of the push for this bill 
comes from concern about secrecy 
rather than whether justice can be 
served in the arbitration context. And 
despite that emphasis, the bill does not 
actually 
address 
confidentiality 
or 
nondisclosure agreements. 
b 1230 
Additionally, arbitration is often less 
expensive and more efficient than liti-
gation. It tends to be less adversarial, 
which allows parties to continue doing 
business together after the dispute is 
resolved. That is why so many Ameri-
cans choose to enter into contracts 
with arbitration clauses in them. 
Voting for this rule is a vote for a 
bill empowering Washington to micro-
manage the business life of Americans. 
Voting for this rule is to take away 
freedoms from Americans. Congress 
should stand ready to improve the 
legal system, and we must make sure 
that whatever we do will actually be an 
improvement for the American people. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
rule and the underlying bills. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to share 
three stories from hardworking Ameri-
cans. 
Connie Nagrampa, a California resi-
dent, started working as a franchisee 
for a marketing company. The com-
pany cheated her out of her invest-
ments, her life investments. When she 
tried to seek accountability, they 
forced her into arbitration. 
The company, conveniently enough 
for them, chose to move the arbitra-
tion process across the country to the 
city of Boston. A California resident 
was expected to fly herself and pay for 
all of her expenses to Boston to seek 
justice. It was too expensive, obvi-
ously, for somebody who has just lost 
her life savings. She lost the arbitra-
tion as a result, and the arbitrator said 
she had to pay more money to the com-
pany. Connie spent years attempting to 
overturn that unjust cause. 
Now let me tell you about a brave 
American Navy reservist, Lieutenant 
Commander Kevin Ziober, whose em-
ployer fired him the same day he was 
deployed to Afghanistan. This is bla-
tantly illegal under Federal law. But 
because the employer had forced all of 
their employees to sign a forced arbi-
tration clause, he was unable to make 
his claim in Federal court and get his 
job back. 
That is what they are defending. 
Let me tell you about another brave 
military 
servicemember, 
Charles 
Beard, whose rights under the Service-
members Civil Relief Act, SCRA, were 
violated by his bank. 
SCRA is a bipartisan law which pro-
vides financial and legal protections to 
servicemembers 
and 
their 
families 
when they are on Active Duty. This is 
especially important given how vulner-
able Active Duty servicemembers can 
be to predatory lending schemes, iden-
tity theft, or other unfair financial 
practices when they are deployed or on 
Active Duty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3756 
March 16, 2022 
Mr. Beard is a former sergeant in the 
Army National Guard, now 100 percent 
VA disabled. When he was on tour in 
Iraq, his wife at the time and their five 
children relied on one vehicle. One day 
the bank decided to repossess that ve-
hicle. It was no longer convenient to 
keep that loan open for somebody risk-
ing their life for us, our country. 
This, too, was a violation of the Fed-
eral law SCRA because he was de-
ployed. When he tried to hold the bank 
publicly accountable in court, he was 
forced into arbitration because of a 
forced arbitration clause buried in the 
fine print. 
These are just three stories of hard-
working Americans. These are the sto-
ries of real people that we need to 
stand up for and protect. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. If we defeat the previous ques-
tion, I will offer an amendment to the 
rule to provide for consideration of 
Congresswoman MCMORRIS
RODGERS’ 
and Congressman WESTERMAN’s Amer-
ican Energy Independence from Russia 
Act. 
I ask unanimous consent to include 
the text of my amendment in the 
RECORD along with extraneous mate-
rials immediately prior to the vote on 
the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
while the majority is continuing their 
agenda of misguided woke policies, 
constituents in my district continue to 
send me photos of their energy bills 
and prices they are paying at the 
pump. 
Since President Biden took office, 
gasoline prices are up more than 50 per-
cent, natural gas is up more than 25 
percent, and diesel fuel is up more than 
47 percent. These price increases are on 
top of crippling, unprecedented infla-
tion. They are attacks on Americans of 
every stripe, class, and creed. 
When adjusted for these factors, 
wages and salaries are actually below 
prepandemic levels. My constituents 
are pleading with the majority to focus 
on this issue rather than the idealism 
filled 
with 
Green 
New 
Deal 
pipe 
dreams. 
To further explain the amendment, I 
yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN). 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the previous question 
so that we can amend the rule to im-
mediately 
consider 
H.R. 
6858, 
the 
American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act. 
We are on the House floor today be-
cause House Democrats have decided to 
bring up yet another bill to benefit 
their special interests instead of deal-
ing with the number one pocketbook 
issue facing the American people. That 
is energy affordability and reliability. 
The world is at the brink of war, and 
Americans are suffering from higher 
prices not only at the gas pump, but in 
every part of American life because 
when energy becomes more expensive, 
everything else does as well. 
Recent news reports show that Dem-
ocrat Members of this body are asking 
the President to declare a climate 
emergency and halt energy production 
on Federal lands entirely. 
The Transportation Secretary—this 
is hard to believe—tells Americans to 
stop complaining about high gas prices 
and buy electric vehicles that cost 
nearly twice as much as the median 
wage in this country. He might as well 
have yelled, ‘‘Let them eat cake.’’ 
Energy security is national security 
and increasing our energy security 
should be the number one priority in 
Congress today instead of finding new 
ways to enrich trial lawyers. 
Representative 
CATHY
MCMORRIS 
RODGERS’ bill, the American Energy 
Independence 
from 
Russia 
Act, 
of 
which I am an original cosponsor, is a 
critical step we must take to reverse 
President Biden’s anti-American en-
ergy policies that have emboldened 
Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine. As 
he fought to keep American energy in 
the ground, our reliance on foreign oil 
grew, and here we are, more reliant on 
foreign sources today. 
Last year, I stood on the floor of this 
House and talked about the flawed de-
cision by President Joe Biden to lift 
sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line, further tying European nations to 
Russian sources of energy; primarily 
natural gas, which burns dirtier than 
American gas. 
In addition, given the resources we 
have here in the United States, we 
should never buy oil and gas from Rus-
sia. That puts American consumer dol-
lars right in the pocket of one of the 
richest men in the world, Vladimir 
Putin. He is laughing all the way to 
the bank and now, sadly, all the way to 
Ukraine. 
Russian oil imports reached an 11- 
year high last year in the United 
States, 
which 
cost 
American 
con-
sumers $17.5 billion. 
The McMorris Rodgers’ bill would 
immediately approve the Keystone XL 
pipeline, remove all restrictions on 
LNG exports, restart oil and gas leas-
ing on Federal lands and waters, and 
require the Biden administration to 
submit to this Congress an energy se-
curity plan to reduce energy and gas 
prices for all Americans. 
Despite President Biden’s deflection, 
this isn’t Putin’s price hike. Gas prices 
were already up 55 percent from the 
day Biden took office, and this was be-
fore Russia invaded Ukraine. 
If you Democrats are going to keep 
telling lies about American energy 
using TikTok actors to push these lies, 
I am going to keep telling the truth 
about what policies are failing Amer-
ican families. 
This attack on American energy 
started during President Biden’s cam-
paign for President. Putin watched as 
Biden vowed to eliminate fossil fuel 
production in the U.S. during the 2019 
Presidential debate, canceled the Key-
stone XL pipeline on his first day in of-
fice, and halted all new oil and gas 
leases on Federal lands. 
Biden’s war on American energy 
knows no limits. This does not have to 
be our reality, folks. The President and 
the Democrat majority could take im-
mediate steps both to strengthen our 
energy security and reduce prices at 
the pump for American families. 
And hear this: America, the United 
States, has led the world in emissions 
reductions. You all don’t want to ac-
knowledge that. The President has 
completely sold out the environmental 
left, whose Green New Deal policies 
have caused consumers to pay an aver-
age of nearly $4.50 per gallon at the 
pump, the highest cost in United 
States history, and still these costs are 
rising. 
Further, many of these environ-
mental NGOs pushing the Green New 
Deal policies are funded by Vladimir 
Putin himself to ensure our dependence 
on Russian energy and kill American 
energy development. 
The United States is blessed with 
abundant natural resources, but we are 
cursed with liberal politicians who 
refuse to allow Americans to benefit 
from them. They also refuse to let our 
allies benefit. There are currently six, 
Madam Speaker, six LNG export ter-
minal permit requests at the Depart-
ment of Energy. Zero have been ap-
proved. Even during President Obama’s 
time, more LNG export terminals were 
approved. 
If Democrats really were interested 
in cutting Putin’s leverage, they would 
be focused on increasing U.S. exports 
to Europe because European nations 
have 40 percent of Europe’s energy sup-
ply coming from Russia. The reality is, 
they would rather sell their Green New 
Deal ideology while lining the pockets 
of tyrants in the Kremlin, Iran, and 
Venezuela. American consumers are 
paying these tyrants. 
Europe and the rest of the world 
needs American energy leadership at 
this time. Drill more. Export now. Cut 
off that money pipeline to Vladimir 
Putin. 
Let’s flip the switch and vote on the 
American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act to unleash American energy 
production and security. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the previous question so the House 
can immediately consider this impor-
tant bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Today, we are supposed to be debat-
ing two very important bills to help 
Americans continue to thrive in this 
great country, but instead my col-
leagues across the aisle want to debate

about something that they know is in-
correct. 
There are over 9,000 approved drilling 
permits the oil industry is not using. 
And the truth is that changes in do-
mestic energy policy often take years 
to impact global energy markets. They 
know that. 
But instead, what is happening here 
is oil companies are using Putin’s war 
as an excuse to jack up prices at the 
pump even more, and then they argue 
for looser regulations, cheaper drilling, 
and more pollution. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a March 4, 2022, opinion article 
from The Guardian written by House 
Natural Resources Committee Chair-
man RAU´ L GRIJALVA entitled ‘‘Oil and 
Gas Lobbyists are Using Ukraine to 
Push for a Drilling Free-for-All in the 
U.S.’’ 
[From the Guardian, Mar. 4, 2022] 
OIL AND GAS LOBBYISTS ARE USING UKRAINE 
TO PUSH FOR A DRILLING FREE-FOR-ALL IN 
THE US 
(By Rau´ l M. Grijalva) 
Last week, we all watched in horror as 
Vladimir Putin launched a deadly, cata-
strophic attack on Ukraine, violating inter-
national treaties across the board. Most of 
us swiftly condemned his actions and pledged 
support for the Ukrainian people whose 
country, homes and lives are under attack. 
But the fossil-fuel industry had a different 
take. They saw an opportunity—and a 
shameless one at that—to turn violence and 
bloodshed into an oil and gas propaganda- 
generating scheme. Within hours, industry- 
led talking points were oozing into press re-
leases, social media and opinion pieces, tell-
ing us the key to ending this crisis is to im-
mediately hand US public lands and waters 
over to fossil-fuel companies and quickly 
loosen the regulatory strings. 
Our top priority must be ending Putin’s 
hostilities, but as chair of the US House 
committee on natural resources, I feel duty- 
bound to set the record straight. We can’t let 
the fossil-fuel industry scare us into a do-
mestic drilling free-for-all that is neither 
economically 
warranted 
nor 
environ-
mentally sound. 
Despite industry’s claims to the contrary, 
President Biden has not hobbled US oil and 
gas development. In fact, much to my deep 
disappointment and protest, this administra-
tion actually approved more US drilling per-
mits per month in 2021 than President 
Trump did during each of the first three 
years of his presidency. Before the pandemic, 
oil and gas production from public lands and 
waters reached an all-time high, and the cur-
rent administration has done little to change 
that trajectory over the last 13 months. 
Fossil-fuel companies and their backers in 
Congress also profess that more drilling on 
public lands and waters would lower gas 
prices for Americans. But if that’s true, why 
hasn’t record oil extraction from both fed-
eral and non-federal lands over the last dec-
ade done anything to consistently lower, or 
at least stabilize, prices at the pump? 
The fact is that crude oil is a volatile glob-
al commodity. Worldwide supply, demand, 
and unpredictable events—like wars—influ-
ence the price of gas, not the current admin-
istration’s decision to approve a few new 
leases or permits. 
Even if we take industry’s claims at face 
value, nothing is keeping fossil-fuel compa-
nies from more drilling on public lands right 
now. The oil industry already controls at 
least 26m acres of public land and is sitting 
on more than 9,000 approved drilling permits 
they’re not using. 
They have a similarly gratuitous surplus 
offshore, where nearly 75% of their active 
federal oil and gas leases, covering over 8m 
acres, have yet to produce a single drop. Any 
new leases issued today wouldn’t produce 
anything of value for years, or even decades 
in some cases. 
If industry did start to ramp up production 
from federal leases, the overall increase to 
the total US supply would likely be mar-
ginal. In 2020, public lands and waters only 
accounted for 22% and 11% of oil and gas pro-
duction, respectively. The vast majority of 
oil and gas resources are beneath state and 
private lands—not public lands or federal 
waters. 
With the facts laid bare, we see the fossil- 
fuel industry’s crocodile tears for what they 
are—the same old demands for cheaper leases 
and looser regulations they’ve been peddling 
for decades. These pleas have nothing to do 
with countering Putin’s invasion or stabi-
lizing gas prices, and everything to do with 
making oil and gas development as easy and 
profitable as possible. 
The US is the world’s top oil and gas pro-
ducer. Doubling down on fossil fuels is a false 
solution that only perpetuates the problems 
that got us here in the first place. 
And quite frankly, we can’t afford to main-
tain the status quo. In its newest report the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) issued its most dire warning yet on 
the rapidly accelerating climate crisis. If we 
fail to enact major mitigation efforts, like 
curbing fossil-fuel development, both quick-
ly and substantially, we will ‘‘miss a brief 
and rapidly closing window of opportunity to 
secure a livable and sustainable future for 
all’’. 
Fortunately, there is a path forward that 
simultaneously cuts the lifeline to fossil-fuel 
despots like Putin, stabilizes energy prices 
here at home, and creates a safer, more sus-
tainable planet. We must wean ourselves off 
our oil and gas dependence and make trans-
formational investments in cleaner renew-
able energy technologies, like those in the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Build 
Back Better Act and the Competes Act, and 
we must do it now. 
The fossil-fuel industry has had hold of the 
microphone for far too long. It’s time we let 
the facts speak for themselves. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, if my colleagues were so con-
cerned about oil prices or the welfare 
and security of humanity in the crisis 
that is happening in Ukraine, maybe 
they should have stepped up and in-
quired about the five meetings that the 
previous administration held in secret 
without staff, only a translator, with 
Vladimir Putin. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1245 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
under the Trump administration, the 
U.S. became a net exporter of petro-
leum for the first time since 1958. 
Under President Biden’s leadership, 
starting with the revocation of the 
Keystone XL pipeline, the U.S. is back 
to being a net importer of petroleum 
and is expected to continue through 
this year. This is unacceptable, and our 
constituents are paying dearly for it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. 
JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose the previous 
question so that we can, instead, con-
sider the American Energy Independ-
ence from Russia Act. 
In recent weeks, we have all seen Eu-
rope struggle to navigate its depend-
ence on Russian energy. It is terrible 
to be beholden to, to be dependent on 
an adversary. And so, like so many of 
my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, I pushed to ban Russian energy 
imports into this country, and I am 
grateful that we have done that. 
But rather than look to other coun-
tries to fill that gap, we should be 
looking here at home. The resources 
that we need for energy security are al-
ready located right here. Now, yes, of 
course, renewables will play an impor-
tant role, but so will North American 
oil and gas. 
The President made a terrible deci-
sion on day one to cancel the Keystone 
XL project. But this bill will move us 
back in the right direction by, once 
again, allowing the permitting and the 
leasing of oil, gas, and mineral develop-
ment on Federal lands and waters. 
Developing a plan for that energy se-
curity, which this bill would also do, to 
better utilize North American oil and 
gas, it would reduce prices; it would in-
crease energy security; and it would in-
crease national security as a result. 
Now, of course my colleague on the 
other side of the aisle is right. Passing 
this bill would not reduce energy prices 
overnight. But the reality is, the sec-
ond best time to plant a tree is today. 
The second best time to make this kind 
of an investment in energy security 
would be right now. 
We did miss too much time. We lost 
too much time during the first year of 
the Biden administration, but we can 
get it right now. And doing that 
doesn’t just bear security benefits, it is 
also cleaner. 
Giving the world an opportunity to 
displace dirty Russian oil with 23 per-
cent cleaner North American oil would 
save the equivalent of 100 million cars’ 
worth of emissions. We can do that. 
Our stuff is cleaner. 
And so, Madam Speaker, we know 
that we can build a cleaner, a better, a 
safer energy future, and we can do it by 
focusing right here at home, and that 
is what H.R. 6858 would do. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
every action the Biden administration 
has taken since Keystone’s cancelation 
has increased our foreign dependency 
on oil. June 2021, 5 months after can-
celing Keystone, the Biden administra-
tion suspends leasing of ANWR. Three 
months later, the White House calls on 
OPEC to boost oil production. Two 
months after that, the Biden adminis-
tration stopped efforts to modernize 
the NEPA permitting process for do-
mestic extraction. 
Every action this majority has taken 
is directly responsible for the prices

March 16, 2022 
consumers are seeing today. Fortu-
nately, the solution to this problem is 
very simple. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHN-
SON). 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, for my colleagues to continue 
to advance this narrative that there 
are some 9,000 permits out there wait-
ing to be drilled demonstrates the na-
ivete of the oil and gas industry and it 
is just, frankly, disingenuous. 
And to make the statement that 
Vladimir Putin is responsible for the 
skyrocketing cost of gasoline, what a 
joke. Gasoline was going up before Rus-
sia ever invaded Ukraine because of 
President Biden’s policies. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the 
previous question so we can imme-
diately consider H.R. 6858, the Amer-
ican Energy Independence from Russia 
Act. I was proud to work on this legis-
lation with Ranking Member RODGERS 
and the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Madam Speaker, we all saw it today, 
President Zelenskyy pleading with the 
United States and the West to do more 
to punish Russia for these atrocities 
and halt Putin’s assault on innocent 
Ukrainians. 
It is obvious that the United States 
and Europe need to do more. But sadly, 
more, much more, could have been 
done before this invasion, and I believe 
it could have all been avoided. 
Madam Speaker, you will hear a lot 
today that energy security is national 
security. Well, ain’t that the truth. 
Our European allies, after years of 
rushing to green, weather-dependent, 
unreliable energy, and shutting down 
their own energy resources, have come 
to learn this the hard way. Their green 
priorities led them to greater and 
greater dependence on Russia, to the 
point that they could do virtually 
nothing as Russian tanks rolled into 
Ukraine. 
Let’s not make the same mistake 
here in America. We can’t make our 
energy supply and the energy supply of 
our allies dependent on some of the 
worst people in the world. 
This legislation would put us on a 
better path. It would restart the Key-
stone XL pipeline; reopen our Federal 
lands and waters to access our abun-
dant natural resources; and it also in-
cludes a provision, legislation that I 
authored, to cut the red tape and un-
leash American liquefied natural gas 
exports, which our allies in Europe are 
currently clamoring for; ultimately, to 
get out from under the boot of Putin’s 
energy dominance. 
There is still time to make things 
right, Madam Speaker, so I am urging 
this Chamber to consider H.R. 6858 im-
mediately. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
the prices American consumers are 
paying at the pump is directly affected 
by how much oil is produced domesti-
cally. Canceling American oil produc-
tion jobs, while seeking it from dic-
tators, is not only nonsensical, but it 
also is against our national interest. 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GOODEN). 
Mr. 
GOODEN 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous 
question so we can immediately con-
sider legislation to force President 
Biden to restore our energy independ-
ence. 
The United States was the largest 
producer of oil and gas in the world 
under President Trump. In less than a 
year, President Biden has destroyed 
our energy sector, created the highest 
gas prices in American history, and 
crippled our economy in the process. 
There is no logic to this administra-
tion’s refusal to unleash our full en-
ergy potential. It is time to ask if this 
administration is holding the reins of 
power, or if radical environmentalist 
groups are calling the shots at the 
White House. 
For 2 years, I have been demanding 
an investigation into foreign funding of 
these 
environmental 
organizations. 
Vladimir Putin has a long history of 
spreading misinformation and using 
activist groups to deter domestic en-
ergy production. In just 10 years, the 
European Union went from producing 
more natural gas than Russia to rely-
ing on them for 40 percent of their nat-
ural gas consumption. Russian dark 
money is to blame, and we have to pre-
vent the same thing from happening 
here at home. 
Russia will use every tool at their 
disposal to undermine our national se-
curity. And by listening to these rad-
ical groups, the Biden administration 
has allowed them to succeed. 
Madam Speaker, we are relying on 
foreign adversaries and authoritarian 
regimes when we have the resources 
here at home to bring down gas prices 
and help our allies in Europe. Instead 
of calling Venezuela and Iran, the 
President should be calling Texas. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, how long will the 
House continue to attack the basic 
freedoms of the American people? It is 
not for Congress in Washington or 
some bureaucrat to tell the American 
people what they can and cannot do 
when 
revolving 
disputes. 
That 
is, 
frankly, none of their business. 
If they want to agree to an arbitra-
tion clause before a dispute arises, that 
is for the American people to decide 
and not Washington, who think they 
know better than the American people. 
It is not our job to micromanage the 
lives of our constituents. It is our job 
to safeguard their freedom. 
We need to consider the unintended 
consequences of this legislation. There 
are many policies in this well-inten-
tioned bill, but if it becomes law, con-
tracts will be far less likely to include 
the option to arbitrate. This may not 
be an issue for people with deeper pock-
ets and the ability to hire attorneys, 
but it will be a concern for those who 
do not have the option of a high-dollar 
settlement. 
We must also keep in mind that 
sometimes arbitration is the best way 
to solve disputes. This is just one of 
the many aspects of this bill that needs 
to be reconsidered before we can move 
forward. 
I oppose this bill, and encourage my 
colleagues to do the same. Everyone 
has the best intentions. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, the rule allows for consider-
ation of these two bills, which will en-
sure that we are providing better pro-
tections for consumers and employees. 
The FAIR Act stops large corpora-
tions from gaming the system in their 
favor, and allows consumers the oppor-
tunity to have their day in court. 
And the CROWN Act ensures that we 
do not allow discrimination in any 
way, shape, or form. These are com-
monsense bills that help the American 
people. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 979 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
6858) to strengthen United States energy se-
curity, encourage domestic production of 
crude oil, petroleum products, and natural 
gas, and for other purposes. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The bill shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
bill are waived. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the bill and on 
any amendment thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except: (1) one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; 
and (2) one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 4. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 6858. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
rule and the previous question. I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution.

RECOGNIZING KEIRA D’AMATO 
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I stand here to recognize the incredible 
achievement of Midlothian resident 
Keira D’Amato. 
Earlier this year, Keira broke the 
American record for the women’s mar-
athon, winning the Chevron Houston 
Marathon with a 2-hour, 19-minute, and 
12-second finish. For those of you keep-
ing score, that is 24 seconds faster than 
the previous record set back in 2006. 
This new record demonstrates Keira’s 
remarkable resiliency, it shows her un-
deniable passion, and it highlights her 
proven ability to overcome injuries and 
adversity. 
As a mother of two, Keira is not just 
a winner, she is an ambassador for her

sport. Her enthusiasm is already in-
spiring the next generation of Virginia 
marathon runners. 
Today, on behalf of Virginia’s Sev-
enth District, I want to congratulate 
Keira for making Chesterfield County, 
central Virginia, and our entire Com-
monwealth proud. We are honored to be 
the home of a true American cham-
pion.

HONORING ROY AND WILMA 
BROWN 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to honor Roy and Wilma Brown, 
who celebrated their 80th wedding an-
niversary this Monday. 
Married on March 14, 1942, at the 
Cumberland County Courthouse, Roy 
and Wilma have remained at each oth-
er’s side ever since. 
Through the ups and downs of raising 
five children on a family farm in mid-
dle Tennessee, in the early days with 
no running water or electricity, the 
Browns have been no stranger to hard-
ship but have always leaned on the 
Lord. On their 69th anniversary, Wilma 
said: ‘‘God has blessed us so much, and 
we are so thankful.’’ 
Madam Speaker, today, I thank Roy 
and Wilma Brown for serving as a re-
minder to all of us, both young and old, 
of the power and longevity of true love. 
May both Roy and Wilma have a 
blessed 80th anniversary, and may this 
day serve as an inspiration for genera-
tions to come. 
f 
INCREASING EtO AWARENESS 
(Ms. NEWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today for Matt Haller. Matt Haller 
was an Illinois resident who passed 
away in 2019 from stomach cancer that 
is believed to have been linked to the 
local EtO sterilization plant near his 
home. 
These same EtO cancerous chemicals 
are used today to sterilize an assort-
ment of foods in the United States. 
While the chemical is clearly banned 
for food sterilization in other countries 
around the globe, it continues to be 
used in America for everyday food 
products like spices, dried herbs, dried 
vegetables, and much more. Food steri-
lized with EtO does not even require 
food labeling in the U.S. 
I am introducing the Matt Haller EtO 
Awareness Act to finally change that. 
This commonsense legislation would 
provide Americans the right to know if 
food has been treated by known car-
cinogenic substances through accurate 
labeling. 
Let’s increase transparency around 
EtO, let’s bring awareness to cases like 
Matt Haller’s, and let’s pass this bill. 
HONORING JASMINE MORAN 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the re-
markable life of Mrs. Jasmine Moran, 
an admirable Oklahoma Fifth District 
philanthropist. 
After surviving World War II in Eng-
land, she uprooted her life to move to 
Seminole after meeting her husband, 
an oil man from Oklahoma. 
Inspired by a children’s museum in 
Michigan, Mrs. Moran decided to start 
her own in Seminole in hopes of re-
igniting the city. Eventually, her idea 
came to life, and she created a world- 
class children’s museum that attracts 
70,000 visitors a year. 
But she didn’t stop there. Almost sin-
gle-handedly, Mrs. Moran created an 
animal shelter that adopts out 75 ani-
mals a month. 
Mrs. Moran’s generosity, resilience, 
and commitment to the betterment of 
her community and everyone around 
her is truly inspiring. 
Though she will be deeply missed, 
there is no doubt that through her self-
less endeavors, her legacy will live on 
forever. Mrs. Moran’s story and the 
way she lived her life should stand as 
an inspiration to all Oklahomans. 
f 
RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to indicate that finally we 
have passed and signed into law the Vi-
olence Against Women Act. 
After years of introducing it and 
passing it in the United States House 
of Representatives, we came together, 
and today at the White House, relief 
has been given to the millions of vic-
tims of domestic violence, rape, and 
sexual assault. 
We provided the opportunity for en-
hanced police efforts for trying to stop 
the most dangerous calls of police offi-
cers: domestic violence; dealing with 
cultural groups that respond to this in 
a different way; and once and for all, 
stopping the dastardly act of raping In-
dian women and escaping prosecution. 
Now we allow the courts on Indian res-
ervations to be able to bring people to 
justice. 
We have provided a place for abused 
persons to live. We have given more 
money to area shelters, like the Hous-
ton Area Women’s Shelter, and we re-
sponded to the advocates across Amer-
ica. 
I am glad to have written and au-
thored H.R. 1620. I thank all of those 
who ultimately brought that bill to 
law. Now, the President has done what 
he has always wanted to do, to have 
the Violence Against Women Act reau-
thorized. 
STOP THE ASSAULT ON AMERICAN 
ENERGY 
(Mr. CARL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, over the 
past few weeks, we have made it very 
clear how important it is for the 
United States to produce its own en-
ergy rather than rely on other coun-
tries for our supplies. 
The President and his allies have 
made things very clear that this is the 
thing that they want to do, shutting 
down American energy production, but 
the reality truly is that we can produce 
energy cleaner and more efficiently 
than any other nation on the planet. 
This administration decided to shut 
down American pipelines and shut 
down 
American 
energy 
production, 
which has done nothing but drive up 
the energy costs while threatening our 
national security and strengthening 
our adversaries around the globe. We 
simply cannot allow this to continue. 
President Trump’s hard work to in-
crease energy production and his lead-
ership actually made us energy inde-
pendent instead of energy dependent 
during his time. 
America has the resources and the 
ability to meet our supply needs, and I 
encourage the President to end his as-
sault on American energy.

BRING BACK AMERICAN ENERGY 
INDEPENDENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. JA-
COBS of California). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 4, 
2021, the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. JOHNSON) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the subject of my Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, we have another crisis, yet 
another crisis, created by the policy 
choices of this White House. 
The national average price for a gal-
lon of gas reached $4.32 on Sunday; and, 
yes, that is the highest price in U.S. 
history. 
Last Thursday, we also learned that 
U.S. inflation soared 7.9 percent over 
the past 12 months. That is the largest 
spike in consumer prices in 40 years. 
Now, the Washington Democrats’ 
blame game is in full swing. Just to get 
this straight, at first, according to 
Democrats, they said inflation ‘‘wasn’t 
happening.’’ Then inflation was ‘‘mere-
ly transitory,’’ they tried to convince 
us. Then inflation somehow only hurt

rich folks; that was the only line of 
reasoning. 
But Washington Democrats’ latest 
fiction might be their greatest yet: 
That the past year of steady, unrelent-
ing price increases for gas and con-
sumer 
goods 
is 
actually 
Vladimir 
Putin’s fault. 
Yes, that is right, Madam Speaker, 
Vladimir Putin. He didn’t kill the Key-
stone pipeline. Joe Biden did. Vladimir 
Putin didn’t ban drilling for oil on Fed-
eral lands. Joe Biden did that. Vladi-
mir Putin didn’t pass trillions upon 
trillions in unnecessary government 
spending in a single year. Joe Biden 
and the Washington Democrats did 
that. 
Madam Speaker, what is so hard 
about just being honest with the Amer-
ican people? President Biden should ac-
cept responsibility for the past year of 
rising prices and pledge to correct 
course. He had better, or we are in for 
more and more pain. 
The President should do everything 
in his power to make it easier, not 
harder, for America to produce more 
oil and gas. This would lower prices for 
the American people. It would make 
our country and Europe less dependent 
on foreign energy. But instead, Presi-
dent Biden says he actually ‘‘can’t do 
much right now’’ about the sky-
rocketing gas prices. 
The Democratic Caucus leader said 
the issue of gas prices ‘‘hasn’t come 
up’’ during his party’s caucus meet-
ings. Really? You haven’t made time to 
discuss any solutions to the number 
one issue facing Americans right now? 
Now that the Biden administration 
and Congressional Democrats know 
they are in a tight spot, here is the 
thing: They are trying to convince the 
American people that an American 
President can’t control gas prices in 
the United States but Russians can. 
Good luck with that. 
I thank my colleagues for being here 
tonight for my Special Order hour this 
evening. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER). 
b 1730 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, we 
have a very, very serious energy crisis 
here on our home shores. As fuel con-
tinues to rise, the Biden administra-
tion continues to point fingers at any-
body but themselves—they have done 
it many times before—for this self-in-
flicted crisis. 
There are statements such as this is 
Putin’s fault. The fact is, though, that 
the numbers truly tell a different 
story, and they do, in fact, tell the 
truth. 
This situation cannot be denied by 
many of our colleagues here in the 
House, that we are issuing virtual 
propaganda about the realities of a na-
tional crisis. 
On January 20 of last year, a gallon 
of gas cost $2.39. After a year with the 
Biden administration, and with much 
of the House leadership supporting, we 
shut 
down 
the 
Keystone 
pipeline; 
paused leases for energy development; 
failed to approve even one permit for 
drilling, not one; imposed new regula-
tions on the energy industry; threat-
ened higher taxes on energy companies; 
and, yes, actually warned banks and fi-
nancial institutions not to make in-
vestments in our domestic energy in-
dustries. 
Yet, what is coming from the White 
House, and many in this House, is to 
blame Putin for the gas prices. It is 
just horrible propaganda. 
Last week, the President actually 
told the American people that he 
‘‘can’t do much right now’’ to lower gas 
prices. Yes, you can. Yes, it can be 
done. 
Meanwhile, they are looking at Iran, 
Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and, up until 
recently, Russia. So why don’t we look 
at central Pennsylvania, west Texas, 
New Mexico, Louisiana? 
Create American energy and Amer-
ican jobs. We need to reverse the poli-
cies that have depressed production, 
throttled back investment, and led to 
higher gas prices at the pump and for 
heating people’s homes nationwide. 
Madam Speaker, energy security is 
national security. I think we have all 
heard that. It has never been more im-
portant to be reminded of it than 
today. We must reverse these damaging 
policies now and safeguard our Na-
tion’s security for today and tomorrow. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, 
from 
energy 
States 
like 
ours—Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and the 
others—we have been saying this for a 
long, long time: Energy security is na-
tional security. Now, everybody recog-
nizes it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY), 
another gentleman who knows quite a 
bit about this issue. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, 2 
weeks ago, we were here and heard 
about how President Biden was going 
to use every tool at his disposal, every 
tool, to combat skyrocketing energy 
costs. 
Now, this is the same administration 
that told us the border was secure. 
That was about a year ago, a little less 
than a year ago. The border was secure. 
And we just saw in the last month, 
once again, record numbers of people 
coming in illegally to our country 
across the southern border. 
Of course, as the gentleman from 
Louisiana 
just 
said, 
inflation 
was 
‘‘transitory,’’ and we are starting to 
hear that his chief economic adviser is 
saying maybe it is not so transitory. 
We are seeing record numbers now, this 
month, in regard to inflation. 
Well, it all started January 20, 2021, 
with the shutdown of the Keystone 
pipeline and all the other actions that 
were taken to limit production here in 
America. 
We saw what is turning out to be a 
foreign policy disaster, the okay of the 
Nord Stream pipeline that is delivering 
natural gas to Western Europe, some-
thing 
the 
previous 
administration 
would never do. 
This is all part of the green fantasy 
here in America that has become 
America’s nightmare. 
Back home in my district, it is $2.85 
a gallon to heat your home with pro-
pane right now. Propane is used by 
about a third of the homeowners in the 
district that I live in. They paid $1.50 
in August 2021. They paid $0.80 a gallon 
in August 2020. That is what they are 
facing. 
President Biden came to my district 
right after the State of the Union 
speech, came to Superior, Wisconsin. 
Once again, we were anxious to hear 
how he is going to use every tool, every 
tool possible, to provide energy for 
America. 
But we didn’t hear a thing about re-
routing the pipeline through northern 
Wisconsin that is held up because a 
permit is not issued by the Governor of 
Wisconsin and his Department of Nat-
ural Resources. 
We didn’t hear a single thing about 
Line 5 that goes through the Straits of 
Mackinac—the Governor of Michigan 
shut down that permit last year—a 
major throughput to Canada and the 
entire Midwest. 
We didn’t hear a word about rebuild-
ing the refinery in Superior, which we 
hope is complete soon. He was there on 
an infrastructure tour. That refinery 
produces all kinds of asphalt. Don’t 
you think that would be a really good 
time—infrastructure, asphalt—to talk 
about rebuilding that refinery? 
Finally, he didn’t say a thing about a 
natural gas plant that is proposed for 
Superior, Wisconsin, nearly a billion- 
dollar investment to produce clean 
electricity with natural gas. 
We didn’t hear a word about pro-
ducing more fertilizer for those farm-
ers to grow our crops. We didn’t hear a 
word about that. 
This President does not understand 
security. Job security, thousands of 
jobs—two of the major pipeline manu-
facturers in the United States are right 
in Wisconsin. We didn’t hear a thing 
about economic security, the inflation 
that is, in part, a result of these in-
creased energy costs. We didn’t hear a 
thing about national security, and that 
is what is at stake. 
The Biden administration has let us 
down on all three fronts, job security, 
economic security, and national secu-
rity. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for his re-
marks. 
Madam Speaker, when we think 
about energy States, of course, we 
probably think about Texas first. I am 
delighted to yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BABIN), who represents 
that State so well. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague and friend across the 
Sabine River from me, Mr. JOHNSON, 
for having this Special Order.

hate the facts because the facts are not

on their side. If we are being honest, 
the facts haven’t been on their side for 
a very long time. Nevertheless, they 
continue perpetuating the lie that do-
mestic energy is somehow bad, and for-
eign energy is somehow good. 
So, join me. Let’s take a look at the 
facts 
here. 
The 
refineries, 
petro-
chemical plants, and American busi-
nesses in and around my district, the 
36th 
Congressional District of the 
State of Texas, are unmatched world-
wide. 
For years, they have showcased what 
our country does best, and that is pro-
ducing superior, high-quality petro-
leum products by leading in techno-
logical innovation. 
The best and brightest Americans are 
constantly discovering new ways to en-
hance safety, lower emissions, and pro-
vide the world with affordable and reli-
able energy. 
But the left, the leftist Democrats, 
they don’t seem to care. They would 
rather lambaste the American public 
for not buying a $60,000-plus electric 
vehicle. In fact, they would rather help 
tyrants and communist countries be-
come energy powerhouses than to 
spend even one cent supporting U.S. oil 
and gas jobs, American ingenuity, or 
our state-of-the-art facilities. 
And in the name of what, eliminating 
greenhouse gases? Give me a break. 
Here is a reality check. When we in-
crease our dependency on foreign na-
tions for our energy needs, we increase 
our carbon footprint. Simple. 
America makes the cleanest energy 
on the planet—fact. Foreign oil and gas 
are not produced using the stringent 
environmental 
regulations 
that 
we 
have here in America, not to mention 
foreign oil must travel farther on less 
safe and less environmentally friendly 
modes of transportation to get that 
product here. 
If Biden and my Democrat colleagues 
want to talk about cleaner energy, 
they must first accept the fact that we, 
America, lead in reducing harmful pol-
lution worldwide. 
Americans are sick of suffering from 
Biden’s anti-oil and gas agenda that 
supports dirtier energy, funds corrupt 
governments, kills their jobs, weakens 
our national security, and raises the 
cost of everything. 
I spent $125 filling up my Ford F–150 
pickup truck this past Monday, just as 
an example. 
But here is the bottom line: If Biden 
and the left honestly believe that for-
eign energy is the best option, then 
they really do not care about the envi-
ronment or the security of our own Na-
tion, the United States of America. 
Acknowledge the facts. Put America 
first. Unleash our energy sector. Help 
the environment. End our dangerous 
dependence on foreign adversaries. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Dr. Babin. That is 
Texas strong, as we expected. 
Madam Speaker, one of the strongest 
Republican delegations in our Congress 
comes from another State, Tennessee. I 
am delighted to yield to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE), one of the 
hardest working men in Congress. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding time tonight. 
Madam Speaker, despite what Presi-
dent Biden and congressional Demo-
crats have to say, higher prices at the 
fuel pump are not because of a Putin 
price increase. 
The price of a gallon of gas increased 
from $2.31 a gallon since President 
Biden’s inauguration to $3.48 the week 
before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. 
That is a 50 percent increase before the 
invasion of Ukraine even began. 
But make no mistake, the Biden ad-
ministration is doing everything they 
can to blame the increase on Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine. They have turned 
to their allies in the mainstream media 
to carry their talking points. 
But I urge all Americans not to let 
the headlines or TikTok influencers 
fool you. This is a crisis caused by 
President 
Biden 
and 
congressional 
Democrats’ anti-energy policies, not 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. 
Unfortunately, we all knew this was 
coming when President Biden said on 
the campaign trail that he would 
‘‘transition away from the oil indus-
try.’’ 
During his first days in office, Presi-
dent Biden declared war against Amer-
ican energy. He moved his plan into ac-
tion by canceling the Keystone pipeline 
and other projects, imposing new regu-
lations on the oil and gas industry, and 
stalling new leases on oil and gas 
projects on Federal lands. 
If the President has a legitimate plan 
to lower energy prices and fight infla-
tion, we, the American people, would 
love to see it. 
But until we do, I can only guess the 
President’s plan is what he has done 
since taking office: spend trillions of 
dollars and hope Americans purchase 
expensive electric vehicles. That is not 
a plan. It is a pipe dream. 
The truth is that this is not the 
America President Biden inherited. 
Under President Trump, America was 
energy independent, even a net oil ex-
porter. Inflation was well under con-
trol. Gas was less than $2.50 a gallon, 
and our enemies were our enemies, not 
potential trade partners. 
But the price of a gallon of gas, along 
with inflation, has increased every sin-
gle month since President Biden was 
inaugurated. The resulting harm to our 
country has been mostly self-inflicted 
and largely driven by Democrats’ mas-
sive deficit spending and by the fact 
that the President has declared war on 
the U.S. oil and gas industry from his 
first day in office. 
Every step he has taken to hinder the 
oil and gas industry diminishes cap-
italism, the very engine of our econ-
omy and our relatively high standard 
of living. 
Whether it is in our schools or with 
our healthcare decisions, President 
Biden’s administration wants you to do 
what they say instead of trusting what 
has made us the most prosperous coun-
try in the history of the world. 
Republicans in Congress stand ready 
to implement policies to make Amer-
ica energy independent again. It is 
time for the President to reverse the 
war against American energy and rec-
ognize that the solution to his energy 
crisis exists right under our feet. Still, 
the President refuses to pull his head 
out of the sand to tap into it. 
He will stop at nothing to satisfy his 
leftwing base, even if it is at the ex-
pense of everyday, hardworking Ameri-
cans, who I am proud to represent in 
middle Tennessee. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, a lot of comments there from 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
ROSE), and we will stay on that theme 
for the great State of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 
Mr. BURCHETT, another gentleman from 
that great State, for more common 
sense. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
greatly appreciate Chairman JOHNSON 
for heading this up day after day. 
I just wonder, have the Democrats 
been to the gas pumps lately? I used to 
love to go to the gas pumps and talk to 
folks to see what was going on. Now, 
honestly, I am afraid to even make eye 
contact with somebody because they 
are going to light you up, Madam 
Speaker. 
I know we see a lot of these little, 
cute stickers. That is not my thing. I 
don’t want to cause any vandalism 
with our President pointing at the 
pump saying, ‘‘I did that,’’ but the 
truth is, he did do this. 
If they would listen to what is going 
on, they would know that America is 
ticked, and they should be. The na-
tional gas average today is $4.30 a gal-
lon. The average a year ago was $2.87. 
In 2020, gasoline or oil was around $17 
a barrel, and today, I believe it has 
dropped to $95. I heard someone from 
the White House earlier bragging about 
how oil has dropped. I mean, that is the 
Washington way, to not talk about how 
it was at $17 a couple of years ago, but 
talk about how it has dropped from 
over $110 down to $95. 
Madam Speaker, we need to turn the 
spigots back on. We need to get back 
into the oil business. The oil and gas 
companies, we have been told that they 
have the permits, and then they boast 
about that, that they are not drilling 
because of it. 
b 1745 
The truth is, Madam Speaker, not 
enough pipelines have been permitted 
to move the product. If they get it, 
there is nowhere for it to go. There is 
no storage capacity. There is no way to 
move the product. The pipelines have 
to be completed, and that is part of the 
master plan here. 
As has been stated by Members on 
this floor and other times, I have 
heard, $7 a gallon and electric vehicles 
are in. That is no way to drive innova-
tion, Madam Speaker. Innovation is

driven through creativity, through cap-
italism, not by crooked politicians and 
evil folks trying to change the Amer-
ican agenda. 
Electric cars are not affordable yet. 
Over $50,000 a car. That is ridiculous. 
You have got over eight adapters on 
the plugs. It takes several hours to 
charge. I don’t know if you have ever 
driven across country or not with a 
family but stopping 8 hours at a truck 
stop is not my idea of a vacation. 
Renewables aren’t reliable sources 
for our power grids. Democrats seem to 
double down, though, on these crazy 
woke environmental agenda issues. It 
just creates higher energy bills for 
Americans, Madam Speaker, and in-
creases costs for business. That is why 
everything is up. 
If you look at the price of fuel, I 
filled up my daughter’s Dodge diesel 
the other day, and it cost me over $100. 
Why are we doing this to ourselves? We 
can turn the spigots back on. We can 
put Americans back to work. We can 
increase our economy. We can show the 
world that we are leaders. 
As the Ukrainian President stated so 
eloquently this morning, our President 
needs to lead the world. It is a shame 
when a country that small has to call 
on a power as great as America and tell 
its leaders to lead once again. Until 
things change, though, Madam Speak-
er, Biden’s economy is a bust. 
I appreciate Chairman JOHNSON and 
his truculent behavior. He has raised 
this from more than lackluster, and I 
want to praise him for that. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate my friend. He has 
been a faithful participant in the Spe-
cial Order hours, getting the message 
to the American people, and it is so im-
portant right now. 
Madam Speaker, I yield next to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
LAMALFA), another gentleman who has 
been very faithful to deliver this mes-
sage to the American people week in 
and week out. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Louisiana 
(Mr. JOHNSON) for faithfully helping us 
get the message out, facilitating that 
because what is really important is 
that we are talking to the American 
public about this situation that we 
don’t have to be in. 
Indeed, we have seen with the fairly 
new Biden administration that infla-
tion has risen tremendously. Now, I 
don’t get pleasure out of bagging on 
the President or anybody else in this, 
but we just have to go to the core of 
the issue. The policies that have been 
put into place have harmed the U.S. 
economy, harmed regular families. 
The cost of fuel has been an espe-
cially noticeable part of this. In my 
home State of California, we always 
enjoy—enjoy—extra costs because of 
the way things are done there. If it is 
$4 for a gallon of gas in the rest of the 
country, it is $5.50 in my home State 
because of the dumb things we do out 
there. 
So this recent surge, indeed, is affect-
ing everybody, but it is an even greater 
burden on rural residents that have to 
drive longer distances. Maybe their 
jobs in agriculture or timber or mining 
are more based on the usage of fuel and 
other inputs that are fuel related. So 
that means that there are fewer ex-
ports of things that are produced in 
rural America, fewer services, there is 
going to be less employment as a result 
of this, too, because of the high cost of 
everything. 
We are talking to some truckers. We 
are seeing there is a point where they 
can’t deliver anymore because they 
can’t afford the fuel and that will be 
soon. Imagine that, when you go to the 
retail level, and you can’t get the nor-
mal things off the shelf you are used 
to. We are already seeing that. There 
are fewer food choices, fewer choices. 
You are waiting longer for parts to 
come to repair vehicles or do anything 
else. 
When 
rural 
residents, 
especially, 
have to drive longer to do anything, 
whether it is to take kids to school, get 
to health services, pick up goods they 
need to do their job, it is just that 
much greater of a burden at these 
prices. 
Take law enforcement, for example. 
Now, cops, especially rural ones, they 
have got a lot of driving to do to cover 
those rural areas, and their costs are 
going through the roof. That means 
counties, small cities are bearing a 
greater burden just to try and keep pa-
trols out there. So that is indeed a det-
rimental effect on basic public safety. 
Farmers, too. We are getting ready 
to plant our crop on our farm here. I 
don’t even want to know what the fuel 
price is to top off my tanks, but I have 
to because it is so high. That is going 
to be passed on to the shelves for peo-
ple to buy food all across the country 
or the farmer is going to go out of busi-
ness if he can’t get the price he needs 
to at the store. 
Rural jobs are extremely important 
for our economy. They are producing 
things that people eat, the fiber they 
use to make clothes that people wear, 
the wood and paper products we use for 
our homes and our business. 
It is really, really high time we take 
action and produce energy in this coun-
try because we can, we should, and we 
can affect the world market and make 
it where Russia is not making a killing 
off their energy because it is a supply- 
and-demand issue. If we fill the mar-
ketplace with low-cost energy, it will 
bring all this back in line. We will be in 
a better position as a Nation to help 
our colleagues, our neighbors in the 
western part of Europe, and cripple 
Putin’s ability to make a killing off 
what he is doing. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for his 
comments. There are so many con-
sequences to these bad policy choices, 
and I appreciate his illuminating many 
of those tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield next to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE), 
another faithful messenger for the 
truth in America. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, while 
the devastating war in Ukraine is 
heartbreaking, we cannot turn a blind 
eye to the crises that President Biden 
has created here at home, especially 
when the American people are paying 
for his failed policies. 
Last week, inflation hit another new, 
40-year high of 7.9 percent in February, 
continuing to impose a hidden tax on 
every solitary American. 
Prices at the pump, utility bills, and 
costs in the grocery store checkout 
line just keep getting worse. 
Yet, instead of reversing his disas-
trous policies and reducing government 
spending in order to alleviate the pain 
inflicted on Americans’ wallets, Presi-
dent Biden pivots to offer deceptive ex-
cuses. 
First, we were told inflation was just 
transitory, that is it, but when price 
hikes continued, the new spin comi-
cally became that inflation is a good 
thing. 
A good thing, really? Struggling 
Americans would beg to differ, Mr. 
President. 
When that messaging failed, the talk-
ing points quickly evolved to blame 
higher prices on corporate greed. It ap-
pears the Biden administration enjoys 
pointing fingers at others instead of 
admitting the truth. 
Now, in light of Russia’s illegal inva-
sion of Ukraine, the Biden administra-
tion’s convenient scapegoat is Russian 
President Vladimir Putin, disingen-
uously labeling the ongoing inflation 
as Putin’s price hike. 
Make no mistake, inflation was sky-
rocketing long before Putin’s troops 
set one foot into Ukraine. These are 
most certainly President Biden’s price 
hikes. He is responsible, and no amount 
of dishonesty can hide the truth from 
the American people. 
In fact, Americans simply can’t af-
ford to buy any more of Biden’s decep-
tive excuses. Instead of playing the 
blame game while workers, families, 
and small businesses suffer, the Biden 
administration 
and 
congressional 
Democrats must reverse course on 
their wasteful spending and failed eco-
nomic policies. We must return to the 
America-first 
principles 
that 
truly 
helped the American people thrive. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. He has a 
way of putting it so clearly, and I am 
grateful for his voice. It is so con-
sistent. 
Madam Speaker, I yield next to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. C. SCOTT 
FRANKLIN), who came to Congress after 
26 years of distinguished service as a 
naval aviator and knows of what he 
speaks. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I always appreciate 
my colleague from Louisiana’s leader-
ship on these important issues and I 
appreciate the time he is yielding me. 
Madam Speaker, as my colleagues 
have shared, the Biden administration

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3767 
March 16, 2022 
has been defined by a series of self-in-
flicted crises. These include failed lead-
ership on the world stage, runaway in-
flation, and a deliberate failure to se-
cure our borders. In fact, you could say 
they are having a record year, record 
high inflation, record violent crime, 
record gas prices, record numbers of il-
legal immigrants, seizures of illegal 
drugs all at our southern border. The 
common denominator in each of these 
disasters is the President himself. 
The President listened to the State 
Department over the recommendation 
of his generals, which led to last year’s 
disastrous withdrawal from Afghani-
stan. 
He shut down American energy pro-
duction, which led to skyrocketing gas 
prices 
long 
before 
Russia 
invaded 
Ukraine. 
He catered to the radicals, flooding 
our economy with trillions in free 
money, and that has created the ramp-
ant inflation that we are experiencing 
today. 
On the border, his reversal of Presi-
dent Trump’s policies has led to nearly 
two million migrants pouring across 
our southern border since he took of-
fice. That is more than the population 
of 15 of our States. Think about that, 
the equivalent of creating a State or 
two every single year with the number 
of people crossing the border. 
These disasters were completely self- 
inflicted, and American families are 
paying the price. 
Despite our political differences, I 
take no joy in watching this adminis-
tration fail. When our President fails, 
America fails. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple need and deserve a true leader. If 
the President is incapable of leading, 
he has a duty to surround himself with 
smart people willing to give him good 
counsel in the best interests of our Na-
tion. Listen to the smart ones and not 
those with a track record of failure, 
and then act on it. 
The President should focus on Amer-
ican energy independence, which will 
bring down gas prices here at home and 
help our allies abroad. He should not be 
talking to a Venezuelan dictator when 
we have reliable, affordable energy 
right here at home. He also needs to 
stop the out-of-control spending and 
reinstate tough border policies to pro-
tect our communities. 
For the sake of our country, this ad-
ministration must stop administrating 
and implementing the worst ideas of 
the D.C. political class and lead deci-
sively. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from Florida for bringing that wisdom 
to the floor tonight. There has been a 
theme here this evening with all of my 
colleagues who have participated in 
this Special Order hour. We have an en-
ergy crisis, the latest crisis that has 
beset the American people because of 
terrible policy choices from this White 
House and the Democrats in Congress. 
It is just plain and simple, those are 
the objective facts. 
It seems like almost a decade ago 
now, but just a little over a year ago, 
if you rewind to the Trump years, you 
can recall, and everyone will know 
again more objective truth, objective 
facts, how well we were doing in all of 
these areas. 
President Biden came in and did ex-
actly the opposite. I mean, when Presi-
dent Trump took office, he came in—I 
remember very vividly the first time 
he came and spoke with the House Re-
publicans in our conference, and he 
told us, among the first commitments 
he made to us—I mean, this is January 
of 2017. He was just taking office. We 
had just begun that Congress, and he 
came and spoke to us and said, ‘‘I don’t 
want to talk about energy independ-
ence anymore. I want to talk about en-
ergy dominance.’’ Dominance, he said. 
Of course, from an energy State like 
mine in Louisiana, the Louisiana dele-
gation was delighted to hear that be-
cause we know what it means not only 
for our State’s economy but for the 
stability, the security of our entire 
country. 
I will tell you what, more objective 
fact, President Trump delivered on 
that promise. In a very short period of 
time, we became not only energy inde-
pendent again, but energy dominant, 
just as he said. We became a net ex-
porter. All boats were rising. The econ-
omy was doing well. In fact, we had the 
best economic numbers in the history 
of the world, not just the history of the 
United States. Prior to COVID, we had 
the best economy because of the policy 
choices that were made. We advanced 
those policies through the Congress; 
President Trump led on them, and his 
administration did a fantastic job. Be-
cause of that, our energy stability, our 
energy security, all of that was well in 
place. 
And then President Biden comes in, 
and he does instinctively, I guess, ex-
actly the opposite. Again, in very short 
order, he reversed all of those great 
trends. As has been articulated so 
many times tonight, among the first 
executive orders he issued—I mean im-
mediately upon taking office in Janu-
ary 2020—was an executive order that 
killed the Keystone pipeline. There 
were more than 42,000 jobs related to 
that project just killed overnight; as 
well as all the energy independence and 
energy dominance that that would 
have meant for us. 
And then he issues the moratorium 
on 
Federal 
production 
on 
Federal 
lands. Well, that killed a State like 
Louisiana. Not just on the land, but 
right offshore as well. Of course, that is 
a big part of our economy and in the 
other energy States. It was just dev-
astating. 
At the same time, while he is killing 
the Keystone pipeline, he is ending 
Federal production on Federal lands, 
he green lights the Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line. That was Putin’s project. So he 
empowers Russia, he fuels the war ma-
chine for Putin because, of course, he 
can supply oil all over Western Europe, 
and that filled his coffers. 
Listen, it was mentioned tonight 
these stickers that are on the gas 
pumps all over the country, these ‘‘I 
did that’’ stickers that have President 
Biden’s picture. It is funny. We don’t 
support vandalism, right? But, I mean, 
I see them all over Louisiana, and it is 
devastating. 
b 1800 
President Biden is pointing to the 
sticker shock, the cost that it is taking 
everyone to fill their tanks, and it is 
exactly right. That is very telling. A 
picture is worth 1,000 words. He is re-
sponsible. These are the results of pol-
icy choices. 
And as Mr. FRANKLIN of Florida said 
a few moments ago, these problems are 
completely self-inflicted. And because 
of that, let’s always remember, they 
can be easily reversed. The President 
could just do the opposite of what he 
has done since he took office; reverse 
course and fix this dilemma for the 
American people. 
But you know what? He won’t do 
that. I don’t know if it is because he is 
beholden to the radical left environ-
mentalist agenda, the climate agenda, 
or if he has some sort of ulterior mo-
tive. I am not sure. 
But I will tell you what: My constitu-
ents are asking that question openly 
right now, and millions upon millions 
of the American people who are suf-
fering because of these policies are be-
ginning to ask that as well. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
yield to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. STEEL), who has a few 
more things to say about this issue. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I am 
sorry I am just a little late because, ac-
tually, the Education and Labor Com-
mittee, we are doing markups right 
now. 
I rise to address the ongoing energy 
crisis and the impact it is having on 
families in Orange County. The picture 
you see here is a snapshot of what gas 
prices looked like for my constituents 
in the past week. But I heard—actu-
ally, this is in Orange County. 
Last week, same time—this isn’t my 
district, but in Sacramento that we 
have actually hit over $9 per gallon. 
These prices have increased 30 percent 
in the last year. 
Gas prices in Orange County, and 
across the country, are rising every 
single day. One reason for these sky-
rocketing costs is policies enacted by 
this administration that have weak-
ened our energy independence and 
made us dependent on foreign oil. 
With the President taking the nec-
essary step of banning Russian oil, it is 
even more important that we return to 
our former energy independence. We 
cannot turn from one foreign dictator 
to another to meet our energy needs. 
We have the resources right here to 
bring down costs and produce the 
cleanest energy on Earth.

March 16, 2022 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in 
pursuing policies to secure our energy 
independence. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I am so grateful the gentle-
woman came to participate. We know 
she is very busy. It has been a long day 
in the Education and Labor Com-
mittee. We are grateful she is doing 
that great work. 
Madam Speaker, I know that the 
time is winding up for our Special 
Order hour. There was a lot going on on 
Capitol Hill today. I am grateful to my 
Republican colleagues for coming in 
and participating and helping to share 
this very, very important message with 
the American people. 
There is a lot of spin going on in the 
country 
right 
now, 
from 
TikTok 
influencers, to media types who are en-
gaging in the spin for the White House 
at their request, and the American peo-
ple see through it. They are making 
and being made to make difficult 
choices for their families. 
Hardworking Americans are suffering 
right now because of these policy 
choices. There is crisis after crisis 
after crisis everywhere we look because 
of, frankly put, poor leadership in the 
White House. 
I believe that we will have a change 
in all of this come November in the 
next election cycle, and with the presi-
dential election that will follow 2 years 
later. And it can’t happen soon enough 
because the White House has shown no 
intention, no indication that they will 
reverse policies, as they should, as we 
mentioned a moment ago could be eas-
ily done to alleviate the pain for all 
these Americans. But for whatever rea-
son, they will not do it. 
Madam Speaker, I will wind down 
this evening. I want to thank my col-
leagues for being here, participating in 
this really important Special Order 
hour, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL) is recog-
nized for 60 minutes as the designee of 
the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members have 5 legisla-
tive days to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the subject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, this month is Wom-
en’s History Month. I think you are 
making 
history, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, one of the youngest women ever 
to be elected from California and, actu-
ally, in the country. Women are mak-
ing history. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be 
here. Hopefully, we are going to have a 
few more speakers here today, but I do 
want to start. 
I am going to take a page out of the 
book of our great First Lady, Jill 
Biden. I attended a ceremony over at 
the White House where she and the 
President celebrated Women’s History 
Month. And she started out with a sa-
lute, I think, to—if you could think of 
anybody who you want to give a shout 
out to, she gave it to her own mother. 
And I am going to start with that too 
because, you know, most of our moth-
ers, they are not very famous, and it is 
not like they made history. 
But the fact of the matter is, moms 
are probably the most influential peo-
ple in the world. In fact, if you ever go 
to an event where someone is being 
honored, who is the first person they 
thank? It is their mother. 
So I am going to start this Women’s 
History Month with my remarks by 
thanking 
my 
mother, 
Dorothy 
Frankel—and let me just say this—who 
has inspired me in every way, and now, 
at 96 years old, with—I would say with 
a mind better than mine—maybe that 
is not saying much, but with her full 
faculties and the energy to live. 
I want to say thank you, mom, like 
all the other moms who give us the un-
conditional 
love 
and 
the 
support, 
whether the sun is shining or the rain 
is raining. 
So today, I think we have some other 
people here. Before I continue my re-
marks, I want to yield to a very special 
friend. 
We talk about making history. I am 
going to yield to one of the most dy-
namic Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives. She is from Texas. She 
has got her hands full. I mean, I will 
tell you what: I don’t know whether it 
is more difficult today being from 
Texas or from Florida, I think our Gov-
ernors are in some kind of contest with 
each other. But I am going to yield to 
the amazing gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me thank the gentlewoman from 
Florida for, first of all, all of her lead-
ership in leading the Women’s Caucus 
for a very sizable period of time; and to 
give us the opportunity to speak about 
women today; and to remind us that we 
really started out with a very impor-
tant woman, and that is, of course, our 
mothers. 
So why don’t I, as well, acknowledge, 
Ivalita Jackson, who served her com-
munity; but, more importantly, her 
profession, and she was proud of that, 
in nursing. And at the time, she was a 
vocational nurse, and she wore the uni-
form with pride. 
She was a mother with pride. She 
was a wife with pride. She was really 
our rock, and she did things that 
showed her sacrifice. She loved her pro-
fession. She loved nursing. She was our 
at-home doctor, probably the doctor 
for the neighborhood. 
But in order to ensure that she was 
home during the day, she made sure 
she took the night shift. And the night 
shift in a hospital is a challenging 
shift. 
We can see all of the great and won-
derful things that nursing has gen-
erated, the heroes of today, the sheroes 
of today, as we went through 2 years of 
the pandemic. But my mother was a 
shero many, many decades ago. 
And I came to love the uniform, came 
to love those white sparking shoes that 
she wore so proudly, came to love and 
honor her sacrifice; and how much she 
gave to her family, her job, her profes-
sion, her church. 
Ivalita Jackson is one to be honored; 
along with her mother, my grand-
mother, Vannie Bennett; my other 
grandmother, Olive Jackson; and then 
my aunt, Valerie Bennett, Vickie and 
Audrey, all wonderful women, and 
Sybil. 
So today, I come to join my col-
leagues to be able to talk about women 
and to celebrate, as the President did 
in Women’s History Month, just 24 
hours ago; but then to celebrate again, 
as I mentioned, now, in law, now the 
law, and that is the Violence Against 
Women Act, that almost a decade, it 
seems—even though we went back as 
far as 2013, that would have been 8 
years—it seems that I have been doing 
this for a decade. 
But I remember standing next to 
Vice President Joe Biden on the reau-
thorization of the Violence Against 
Women Act, which was in 1996. I call 
the image, me in short stature and Joe 
Biden, tall stature, but yet, one of 
great compassion. 
And I loved hearing him speak today, 
how culturally out of step men were, or 
the community was, or the Nation was, 
in trying to understand why he would 
be engaged in fighting against domes-
tic violence. I remember him today 
saying, they asked me whether or not 
he had come from a family of domestic 
violence, or he had abused his wife or 
he had known someone in his family 
who had experienced that. And he 
looked at them incredulously and said 
no. 
It is something to care about. Domes-
tic violence kills. Sexual assault can 
kill. Rape kills, and it destroys lives. 
From very little girls and very little 
children, boys or girls, to adulthood. 
We loved him for saying that. And 
out of that passion came the first Vio-
lence Against Women Act centered 
around domestic violence. Then it grew 
to focus on the wide breadth of sexual 
assault in this Nation. 
In speaking to the head of the major 
chiefs at the White House, she re-
affirmed the fact, as a chief of police of 
a major city, that domestic violence 
calls are the most deadly for law en-
forcement officers, and don’t end well, 
in many instances, for our families. 
It is appropriate in this month of 
women’s history, that we also have a

curative response by putting into law, 
after so many years of trying, intro-
ducing over and over again this legisla-
tion, and finally, H.R. 1620 became law 
as the Senate passed that bill with an 
enhancement of what we had included, 
which was the work dealing with Na-
tive Americans, the work dealing with 
providing for housing, the amount of 
money, $1 billion, to cover the many 
new issues dealing with women, dealing 
with cultural organizations, different 
women from different ethnicities, lan-
guage; we were responding to the needs 
that they have, religious groups. We 
have cultural training for young men 
and boys. 
We wanted to make sure that we did 
not, in any way, undermine what the 
President had dreamed about when he 
first introduced this legislation, I be-
lieve, in 1994. 
So I wanted this to be part of Wom-
en’s History Month because it was a 
long journey. And let me thank all of 
the advocates who, year after year, 
month after month, day after day, sec-
ond after second, minute after minute, 
hour after hour, met with all of us to 
try to work to enhance and to be as-
sured of the best kind of legislation 
that we could secure. 
Today was a celebratory day. But I 
really focus on it for saving lives. And 
I just imagine, somewhere in America 
today is a woman being abused, a 
woman suffering. And we now have a 
law that her State and Federal Govern-
ment law enforcement can maybe in-
tervene, and her days of being abused 
will be ended. 
b 1815 
I do want to also acknowledge, as I 
move toward the historic women, the 
kind of work women do. I want to 
make sure that we talk about daycare 
owners. 
This is The Gingerbread School, and 
I thank the owner for taking the chil-
dren of mothers who work day-in and 
day-out, hourly wages, night shifts. I 
remember my mom, as I said, working 
night shifts. 
She is there for them. These are the 
kind of women in Women’s History 
Month that deserve honor and respect, 
and I thank her for it. 
Madam Speaker, then I acknowledge 
the fact that women are in the medical 
profession. We used to take them for 
granted. There are a rising number of 
women becoming doctors. We did not 
take them for granted in the horrors of 
the pandemic of COVID–19 because we 
were desperate for those who were test-
ing when the vaccines came or vacci-
nating. But most importantly, it was 
those nurses at our bedside, for those 
on ventilators, those in hallways, those 
who were suffering. 
COVID–19 was devastating and dead-
ly, and it was the nurses and the med-
ical professionals, the many women 
who provided the kind of support that 
maybe got us through. 
I thank those late-night shifts. I 
thank those tears, those collapsing on 
sidewalks outside of hospitals saying, 
‘‘How much more can I take?’’ They 
took more, and they kept going on and 
on and on. 
I pay tribute to the millions of med-
ical professionals who are women. I 
support all of them, but I particularly 
support those who are women. 
Madam Speaker, today, we had a 
hearing in the Budget Committee on 
the question of how the pandemic im-
pacted women, and I want to make one 
point about that. It was unanimity. 
Certainly, it was recognized by one of 
our witnesses that the idea of childcare 
being only 7 percent of your income 
under the Build Back Better Act would 
be transformative; that childcare keeps 
women out of the workforce, but most 
importantly, it takes 25 or 50 percent, 
even, of their income. Remember, they 
still are the lowest paid. 
We realize, in this Women’s History 
Month, there are many things that we 
need to do to improve the lives of 
women. With that in mind, I now cite 
some of the women who should be hon-
ored who have done great things. 
First, I do acknowledge the paycheck 
fairness bill that we did this year; the 
child tax credit, driven by women, 
joined by great men, but driven by 
women and really saving the lives of 
families all over America. 
Madam Speaker, I acknowledge Vice 
President 
KAMALA
HARRIS—histori-
cally, the first woman of color to serve 
in the highest offices of the land as 
Vice President of the United States, a 
woman of Indian descent and African 
descent. 
It is important to take note of the 
fact that an estimated 10 million peo-
ple in this country, as I spoke earlier, 
experienced 
domestic 
violence, 
and 
that is why, again, we celebrate this 
month with the passing of that bill. 
But I just want to give a roll call of 
the 
many 
pioneering 
women 
who 
should be recognized today: 
Shirley Chisholm; Barbara Jordan; 
and as well those early pioneers, Har-
riet Tubman, who led the Underground 
Railroad and slaves to freedom; So-
journer Truth, an abolitionist as well a 
suffragette who said the words, ‘‘Ain’t 
I a Woman’’; Rosa Parks, who refused 
to get up so that she could sit so that 
others might walk and others might 
run toward justice. 
Astronaut Mae C. Jemison, my dear 
friend, a Houston resident, the first Af-
rican-American woman to go into 
space. 
Mathematicians like Katherine G. 
Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary 
Jackson, those mathematicians who 
helped NASA in the early days by pen-
cil and hand, calculating major cal-
culations needed for space exploration. 
Authors Maya Angelou, Toni Morri-
son, and Gwendolyn Brooks, all enor-
mous authors with enormous missions 
and all fighters for justice. 
All of these persons, in their own 
way, provided a pathway for women. 
I am very pleased to have brought 
the first African-American statue into 
the United States Congress—designed 
and sculpted by a woman, and as well 
raised the dollars to bring her here. 
She now sits in Emancipation Hall, and 
her next journey is going to be in the 
rotunda or Statuary Hall, where she 
belongs with the other suffragettes. 
We know that Shirley Chisholm was 
the first Black woman to ever serve in 
the United States House of Representa-
tives and the first woman to ever run 
for President of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I want to take note 
of my hometown heroes, such as Nellye 
Joyce Punch, Ramona Toliver, Beulah 
Shepard, Christia Adair. These are 
women who have since gone on, but 
they were pioneers in their time, fight-
ing for what was right. 
I remember Beulah Shepard saying, 
‘‘It just takes one vote.’’ 
Nellye Joyce Punch led on hunger 
and trying to stamp out hunger, as she 
was a great teacher. 
Ramona Toliver was an activist in 
Frenchtown in the Fifth Ward and al-
ways fought to ensure that the people 
of that community were responded to 
and not ignored. 
Madam Speaker, I think it is impor-
tant to realize that as we honor 
women, we must recognize they find 
themselves in many different careers. 
Coming from Houston, I want to ac-
knowledge Sally Christian Ride, the 
first woman sent into space; Eileen 
Marie Collin, the first space shuttle 
pilot; and, of course, numbers of other 
unsung heroes in the space program. 
I mentioned Vice President KAMALA 
D. HARRIS, and I want to emphasize, as 
I close my remarks, that we have yet 
another journey to take. That is the 
final confirmation after hearings of the 
next person to ascend to the Supreme 
Court, and that is a Justice Brown 
Jackson, who by all accounts is an out-
standing—without 
question—legal 
scholar and jurist. I hope for her, in 
this time of newness and difference, 
that she will be greeted by those who 
will 
look 
to 
her 
credentials, 
her 
firstness, and, of course, the constant 
excellence that she has shown. 
Women have always been challenged 
as to whether or not they could do the 
job. I leave you with the names of 
Golda Meir of Israel, Indira Gandhi of 
India, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, 
Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain, 
Angela Merkel of Germany, and Portia 
Simpson-Miller 
of 
Jamaica, 
among 
many others. 
I know that there are millions of 
women who we have left out, but 
today, we come to celebrate under the 
leadership of LOIS FRANKEL, as well as 
the Democratic Women’s Caucus, to be 
able to once and for all put a mark in 
this CONGRESSIONAL RECORD to say that 
we paused to say thank you to women, 
that we paused to say thank you to the 
new and many Members of the United 
States House of Representatives who 
have grown and grown, Members who 
happen to be women. 
The few women who were here when 
I came in 1995, we have exponentially

grown in excellence, and we have 
brought a new face, a new perspective. 
I remember those days, sitting lonely 
on the Committee on the Judiciary 
with Pat Schroeder as, day after day, 
our friends on the other side of the 
aisle brought up partial-birth abortion. 
Over and over again, Pat and I tried to 
explain that these are decisions that 
are health decisions that should be left 
to the mother, her faith leader, and her 
doctor. 
It is sad that the State of Texas has 
failed to remember such and continues 
to abuse women in that State as it re-
lates to choice and the ability to seek 
a lawful abortion as they may desire 
with their church, their doctor, and 
themselves. 
Madam Speaker, the last point that I 
want to make, that mothers have to 
deal with, are the horrible actions of 
Governor 
Abbott 
dealing 
with 
transgender children. I want to say on 
this floor today that this is part of 
women’s history because it was the 
parents but the mothers leading to pro-
tect their children from the abuse of 
this governmental agency, suggesting 
that you could not have trans medical 
care, 
trans-affirming 
medical 
care; 
that you, as a mother, could not pro-
tect your child. 
Thank you to the mothers who have 
stood up. Thank you to the court that 
indicated that you, Governor Abbott, 
are wrong yesterday, wrong today, and 
wrong tomorrow. 
These are our precious children. 
These are precious lives. These are pre-
cious families. These are precious 
mothers. 
My tribute to women today includes 
my tribute to the fighters that have al-
ways stood up for what is right, what is 
conscience, and what is just, either in 
fighting 
for 
democracy; 
fighting 
against the terror of January 6; fight-
ing for women’s rights in the Violence 
Against Women Act; fighting against 
abuse; fighting to stamp out hunger; 
fighting to stamp out anger; and fight-
ing in Ukraine to be able to stand 
against a despot called Putin, who is 
violent and is a war criminal killing 
children. 
The mothers in my State who are 
standing for their trans children, I 
offer them my greatest respect and dig-
nity as we salute Women’s History 
Month. 
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, this 
Representative is going to go down in 
history as one of the most articulate 
fighters for justice we have ever seen. I 
give her a special congratulations for 
all the work she did on the Violence 
Against Women Act that was cele-
brated today. 
Madam Speaker, I recognize another 
historic woman who is very prolific. I 
will highlight just a couple of things. 
She 
brought 
to 
this 
venue 
the 
#MeToo movement. She has been the 
champion in changing military law to 
protect people from sexual violence. 
And she is my co-chair of the Women’s 
Caucus. And I could go on and on. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from the State of California 
(Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Florida 
and my friend and co-lead on the 
Democratic Women’s Caucus. I must 
say, she is always the shining light 
when it comes to finding purpose and 
the opportunity for women to succeed. 
She has proven herself over and over 
again as we have seen our numbers of 
women grow here in the Congress of 
the United States. 
To my good friend Congresswoman 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE, today was a great 
day of celebration as VAWA was reau-
thorized. I know you concurred with 
me when President Biden said, Why 
don’t we make this permanent? That is 
precisely what we should be doing. But 
somehow, it is a law that has to be re-
authorized every 5 years. It used to be 
almost something that we did in a bi-
partisan fashion, and reauthorization 
was almost automatic. But recently, 
that wasn’t the case. 
So to Congresswoman JACKSON LEE, 
thank you for the very complete and 
comprehensive review of women in 
America that you just provided us. 
As we celebrate national Women’s 
History Month, we were all asked to 
talk about someone that we wanted to 
pay special attention to. I decided that 
I was going to speak about a particular 
group of women who represent what 
the essence of womanhood is, which is 
that they are tenacious, that they are 
courageous, that they are gritty, and 
that they will go wherever they need to 
go to achieve their goal. 
There was what was called the Night 
of Terror in November 1917. During 
that whole period of time, women 
would march every day here in Wash-
ington, D.C., thousands of them. For 
the first time, they went and picketed 
outside the White House. It had never 
been done before. They chained them-
selves to the cyclone fence at the 
White House. 
On this night in November 1917, there 
were 35 of these women who were ar-
rested. They were beaten, and they 
were spat upon. They had rotten eggs 
thrown in their faces. The food they 
were given in jail was so bad that many 
of them went on a hunger strike, and 
then they had tubes put in their noses 
to force-feed them. One woman was 
struck between the eyes and lost one of 
her eyes. 
What were they doing this for? So 
women could get the right to vote in 
the United States. 
b 1830 
Because up until that time women 
were, for all intents and purposes, 
chattel. There were people like George 
Bernard Shaw who said: If women got 
the right to vote there would be a 
crushing tax on bachelors in America. 
Another one from the Seneca Falls Re-
view that said: If women got the right 
to vote they would become thin-lipped, 
fat-handed, and flat-chested. Oh, my 
God. 
Those were the kinds of thoughts 
that somehow women did not have the 
mental capacity to vote because in 
their skull they only had puppies and 
chocolate and babies that were in their 
brains; that somehow that was the 
kind of political cartoon that was rep-
resented. 
Certainly, women who were meno-
pausal couldn’t vote because they were 
near extinction. Women who were preg-
nant or having children couldn’t vote 
because they were lactating. You name 
it, they came up with it. Having said 
all that, there were true sheroes of 
that generation. 
Madam Speaker, I want to speak to-
night about a different group of women 
who are fighting for the lives of their 
countrymen and -women, and that is 
the strength of the Ukrainian women. 
Here is a Ukrainian woman. Here is 
someone bloodied by Putin’s weapon 
systems: she is still standing; she is 
still alive. We can’t say that about all 
the women in Ukraine. The world 
looked on in absolute horror as images 
of injured and murdered Ukrainian 
women 
and 
children 
have 
spread 
around the globe. 
When the hospital in Mariupol was 
bombed, we saw pregnant women hold-
ing their bellies, climbing down stairs. 
Then we saw a stretcher of a women on 
a towel—it looked like it was a colorful 
towel that she brought with her to the 
hospital. The photo of this pregnant 
woman who was rushed out of the ma-
ternity hospital in Mariupol last week 
made my blood run cold. The news yes-
terday that she and her baby had died 
outraged me. 
She was taken to another hospital in 
Mariupol and when she realized she was 
losing her baby, medics said that she 
cried out: Kill me now. Her pelvis was 
crushed. Her hip detached. The baby 
was delivered by C-section, but showed 
no signs of life. She died shortly there-
after. 
That is an imprint on my mind that 
will never leave me and should never 
leave any of us because what is hap-
pening to women in Ukraine is sinful, 
it is immoral. It is in fact a crime 
against humanity. 
Putin’s forces also killed Tetiana, 
her son Mykyta, 18, and her daughter 
Alisa, 9, as they tried to flee Kyiv with 
a church volunteer. She worked for a 
Silicon Valley software company and 
was married to her husband of 23 years. 
He said, ‘‘I have lost everyone and lost 
the meaning of life.’’ 
Women in Russia are suffering, too, 
and they are showing lots of guts. They 
are speaking out against Putin. Here 
you see a woman, her name is Marina 
Ovsyannikova. She ran on to the live 
TV set on a Russian TV station, the 
most-watched news program in all of 
Russia, to protest the war. Her sign, 
which is written both in English and in 
Russian, reads: No war. Stop the war. 
Don’t believe the propaganda, they are 
lying to you. 
After she was taken into custody, she 
was questioned for 14 hours. She wasn’t

allowed to sleep, to access her family, 
her lawyers, and she refused to recant 
her message. Somewhere in Russia 
right now is Marina, another coura-
geous woman who is speaking truth to 
power. Russian mothers are angrily de-
manding Putin to be held accountable 
for using their sons, as many as 6,000 of 
whom have already been killed in 
Ukraine, using them as cannon fodder 
for his egotistical legacy project. 
I am also in awe of the brave Ukrain-
ian women literally leading the fight 
to protect their country. Nearly 22 per-
cent of Ukraine’s armed forces are fe-
male—22 percent. Here you see them in 
their camouflage. The 22 percent is one 
of the highest percentages of females 
serving in the military in the world. In 
the United States it is only something 
like 18 percent. And more women are 
joining the fight every day. 
Even women members of Ukraine’s 
parliament have taken up arms to de-
fend their homeland. I think about 
that and I think how many of us 
women parliamentarians in Congress 
would do the same? It is a good oppor-
tunity for us to do some soul-search-
ing. 
We must have the backs of all 
Ukrainian women. I am proud that the 
United States has imposed unprece-
dented sanctions and export controls 
on the Russian economy. Just last 
week we stood on this floor and passed 
the bipartisan $13 billion aid package 
for Ukraine to assist the military and 
provide for the humanitarian needs. 
Today, the President announced an-
other package of weapons that are 
going to be sent to Ukraine, including 
Javelins and switchblades and body 
armor and helmets and drones, all in 
an effort to try and provide more pro-
tection for the people of Ukraine. 
We must hold Putin accountable for 
the immeasurable death and suffering 
he has wrought. In doing so, I hope we 
can show a fraction of the grit and per-
severance of the Ukrainian people, and 
especially the women of Ukraine. 
Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Representative 
SPEIER. I will tell you what, it is really 
hard to follow those remarks. I think 
all of us—all Americans—really all 
people around the world who have been 
following the brutality of Putin’s war, 
our hearts are breaking. I thank the 
gentlewoman for highlighting the spe-
cial plight of the women. 
As I said, it is almost hard to talk 
about anything after that, but I do 
want to say this. For about 200 years 
women have been fighting for rights, 
for rights that White men and then 
eventually Black men had, but we are 
still fighting for them. 
I was just thinking back to my own 
childhood—and probably your child-
hood, too. They had limits on how 
many girls could get into law school or 
medical school; there were no sport 
scholarships available. If you were a 
married woman, you could only get 
credit in your husband’s name. Abor-
tion was illegal. Equal pay was not 
even a concept. We did finally get the 
right to vote after women were ar-
rested and chained themselves to the 
White House. 
So if you look back in history, we 
have been fighting very hard to get our 
rights. I want to thank Representative 
JACKSON LEE, she has highlighted some 
of the victories over the years and 
some of the women who led the way, 
whether it was with Title IX or Roe v. 
Wade, or the bill that was just cele-
brated today by the President, the 
Equal Pay Act, the Paycheck Fairness 
Act. A lot has been done, but, wait, 
they are all in jeopardy. 
It is just shocking that after all 
these years of fighting, every one of 
these rights are in jeopardy, including 
the right to vote, which is why—and I 
know my colleagues here would agree— 
we must have an equal rights amend-
ment. We must have inscribed in the 
U.S. Constitution equality for men and 
women that cannot be changed at the 
whim of a political body. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
allow me to again express my apprecia-
tion to the growth and bounty of the 
Women’s Democratic Caucus. It is 
amazing, the coming together of now 
generational women, freshmen classes, 
sophomore classes, and some of us who 
have had the privilege of serving for a 
period of time. What an amazing power 
base that you and we have created. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
LOIS 
FRANKEL for her leadership. I thank 
BRENDA LAWRENCE and JACKIE SPEIER 
for the way they have guarded and 
guided this privilege with this power. I 
do think it is important to put in the 
RECORD her singular work. She will not 
say singular work, but we were all glad 
to join her. 
Obviously, this particular young sol-
dier came out of the breadth and depth 
of Houston and out of Texas—but to be 
able to honor the life of a young 
woman that simply wanted all her life 
to join the United States Army. JACKIE 
SPEIER had been working on the issue 
of sexual assault in the military, along 
with our good friend, Senator GILLI-
BRAND, and the lack of justice that we 
were seeing all the time. This had been 
going on for a very long time. 
It is important in this Women’s His-
tory Month to say that we together 
made history with your legislation 
that responded to the heinous crime of 
the killing of Officer Guillen, a pre-
cious young women, who, growing up 
as a little girl wanted to be in the 
United States military. 
I think this is the point that should 
be made. Only in this recent time can 
young girls want to grow up to be gen-
erals, 
astronauts, 
presidents, 
sci-
entists, and others. As Ms. FRANKEL 
and Ms. SPEIER indicated, the abuse 
that was laid upon women for even 
thinking about equality or justice or 
voting. And then, of course, I must say 
that African American women found 
themselves at the lowest wrung of the 
ladder and suffered the continuing lin-
gering history of slavery, the rape that 
was put upon them, the tending to 
whatever child was born, and then, of 
course, tending to the fields. 
Here we are today with a little bright 
light—and I am going to say little 
bright light because Ms. FRANKEL laid 
out all the things we need to do: the 
ERA, and we hope to get this new Jus-
tice. 
I wanted to take a moment just to 
respond and build upon this vile war 
criminal who seems to have Ukraine— 
God bless the soldiers, the men, the 
men that stayed behind to fight, but 
the toll has been so brutal on the 
women of Ukraine. 
Even in the last 24 hours, women are 
leaving safe places in Poland and Ro-
mania and they are coming back to 
Ukraine demanding that they fight, 
that they stand with the people of 
Ukraine for the democracy that they 
love. The death toll is brutal. The way 
they are dying is brutal. To be running 
with your child thinking you are pro-
tecting them. And to have the greatest 
moment of your life, the birth of a new 
baby, and you die and the baby dies, 
and your whole innards are crushed. 
Besides the women that are left be-
hind in pools of blood—then the women 
who are escaping with their children 
who have nothing. This has been found 
around the world in Sudan when we 
were fighting against genocide. The 
victims were women who were trying 
to hold on to families in Rwanda. 
Places in South and Central America; 
the missing Mexican women that we 
have been working on for years. 
b 1845 
My previous Member from California 
had led us in this fight, and we are still 
fighting. In the United States missing 
girls 
and 
human 
trafficking 
is 
a 
scourge today, and the dominant popu-
lation of human trafficking are girls 
and girls who were tending to their 
daily duties of going to high school 
and, all of a sudden, they walked away, 
and they are in human trafficking, or 
they are being trafficked. 
So we have a lot to fight. We have a 
lot to put on the RECORD today and 
this month. We have got a lot of grand-
mothers to thank, a lot of moms to 
thank, and a lot of firsts to thank. We 
have got a lot of poets who have de-
scribed our lives and a lot of writers 
who have described our lives. We have 
got a lot of children who simply say 
thank you. 
I guess I don’t want to leave the po-
dium. 
I must thank the teachers because if 
ever people were elevated to know how 
much you appreciate women, this 2- 
year, 3-year period of the pandemic 
really laid it out. You were either sac-
rificing as a mother because you were 
wearing 25 hats, Madam Speaker, and a 
lot 
of 
them 
dealing 
with 
homeschooling and trying to make do. 
You were a nurse; you were a teacher. 
You were simply in the fight.

March 16, 2022 
Madam Speaker, you were a doctor, 
you were a hospital administrator, you 
were an EMS, you were a fire person, a 
police person, and you were in here 
dealing with just the pit of COVID–19 
and what it was doing to our families. 
You could have been in the funeral 
home business as a woman, and you 
were dealing with these circumstances. 
So let me just give a big thank you 
in this month, and I hope that if I have 
not called your name, I am giving a 
big, overall thank you to all of you 
women. We recognize all of our gentle-
men. But today, all of you have stood 
in the gap during a time in America’s 
history that no one ever expected. 
So I say thank you to Congress-
woman FRANKEL, to Congresswoman 
SPEIER, and to all the women. We 
count them as being on the floor today 
to be able to honor Women’s History 
Month and then, of course, Inter-
national Women’s History Month to be 
able to say thank you to all of them. 
I must say thank you to the Paki-
stani women. I was at the Pakistani 
Embassy last night. I don’t want to 
leave the floor without saying I met a 
lot of Pakistani Americans who were 
there 
celebrating 
Women’s 
History 
Month and to honor Pakistani-Amer-
ican women. 
First, I would like to thank the Democratic 
Women’s Caucus for hosting this Special 
Order to celebrate Women’s History Month. 
During Women’s History Month, we cele-
brate the generations of trailblazing women 
who, in the face of daily hardship and sys-
temic discrimination, have paved a path to-
ward gender justice. 
It also serves as a global call to action, call-
ing on us to advance the rights and dignities 
of women at home, at work and in all aspects 
of life. 
Women have always led the effort to create 
a more fair, more resilient, more prosperous, 
and more equal America. 
It brings me great pride that in 2022, women 
are not only working tirelessly to meet the 
needs of this unique moment, women are tak-
ing the lead. 
With Vice President KAMALA HARRIS making 
history for our nation, with more women than 
ever before serving in Congress and taking on 
leadership roles in the President’s cabinet, 
with the first Black woman nominated to the 
Supreme Court, with women leading some of 
America’s largest and most innovative busi-
nesses, and with women continuing to break 
ground as scientists and researchers, America 
is stronger because of women. 
I am proud that House Democrats are lead-
ing efforts to expand on opportunities for 
women and to combat gender discrimination. 
In addition to our work to close the gender 
wage gap by passing the Paycheck Fairness 
Act, a major part of that effort includes ad-
dressing the challenges posed to American 
women by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
It is important to recognize that the burden 
of caring for children, the elderly, and the sick 
still falls to women unevenly in our society, 
and the pandemic forced many women to sac-
rifice their careers to care for loved ones. 
Last year, Democrats and President Biden 
enacted the American Rescue Plan, which ex-
tended the expanded Child Tax Credit to help 
families make ends meet and help women 
stay in the workforce and return to their jobs. 
It is now year 3 of the Coronavirus pan-
demic, which means that women have been 
leading the COVID–19 response, combatting 
the virus in America and around the world. 
During Women’s History Month, we honor 
the female frontline health care workers. 
From health care to home care, restaurants 
to grocery stores, women workers, low-paid 
workers, and women of color are on the front 
lines of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
According to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics survey, nearly 80% of healthcare workers 
and 83% of workers who provide social assist-
ance, including child care and emergency 
services, are women. 
Additionally, women-dominated occupations, 
such as nurses, flight attendants, and personal 
care aides, are among the most vulnerable to 
getting sick and spreading it to others. 
Women are also in the position to suffer the 
most in an economic recession. 
Women are the most economically vulner-
able, comprising nearly 60% of workers in low- 
wage occupations. 
Low-paid women workers have very little in 
the way of savings, which means it is much 
harder for them to weather economic shocks, 
especially when they are likely to be sup-
porting a number of dependents. 
Just this week, my bill, VAWA, was reau-
thorized as part of the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2022, which President Joe Biden 
signed into law. 
We must continue to do more to ensure that 
law enforcement has all the tools it needs to 
protect Americans from domestic violence, 
stalking, and sexual assault and that survivors 
have the resources to heal. 
VAWA is life-saving legislation. 
This legislation was enacted in response to 
the prevalence of domestic and sexual vio-
lence, and the significant impact of such vio-
lence on the lives of women. 
Statistics have revealed that these forms of 
violence impact us all. 
In the United States, an estimated 10 million 
people experience domestic violence every 
year, and more than 15 million children are 
exposed to this violence annually. 
According to the National Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence, about 20 people per 
minute are physically abused by an intimate 
partner. 
About 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men experi-
ence severe intimate partner physical vio-
lence, sexual violence, and/or partner stalking 
with injury. 
Today, in Texas, 35.10 percent of women 
and 34.5 percent of men are subjected to do-
mestic violence. 
As we celebrate Women’s History Month, let 
us reflect on the women who shaped our his-
tory and on those today who are leading our 
nation forward. 
We must work toward a future with equal 
access to economic opportunities, health care, 
and safety for all Americans. 
It brings me great pride to say that more 
than 120 women House Members proudly fol-
low in her footsteps—including a record num-
ber of committee and subcommittee chairs, 
myself included. 
Driven by these women’s devoted service 
and guided by their leadership, the Democratic 
House continues to lead the way in building a 
more just future—whether strengthening the 
rights of women in the workplace through the 
Paycheck Fairness Act and Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act, defending reproductive health 
freedoms with the Women’s Health Protection 
Act or advancing the Build Back Better Act’s 
historic investments in maternal care, paid 
family and medical leave, childcare and more. 
Last month we celebrated the contributions 
of African Americans to the history of our 
great nation, and paid tribute to trailblazers, 
pioneers, heroes, and leaders like U.S. Con-
gresswoman Barbara Jordan; U.S. Congress-
man Mickey Leland; Mae C. Jemison; activ-
ists, intellectuals, authors, and artists like Har-
riet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni 
Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks, to name 
just a few of the countless number of well- 
known and unsung heroes whose contribu-
tions have helped our nation become a more 
perfect union. 
The history of the United States has been 
marked by the great contributions of African 
American activists, leaders, writers, and art-
ists. 
As a Member of Congress, I know that I 
stand on the shoulders of giants whose strug-
gles and triumphs made it possible for me to 
stand here today and continue the fight for 
equality, justice, and progress for all, regard-
less of race, religion, gender or sexual orienta-
tion. 
Women’s History Month is also a time to re-
member many pioneering women like U.S. 
Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm; activists 
Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks; astronaut 
Mae C. Jemison; mathematicians like Kath-
erine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary 
Jackson; authors Maya Angelou, Toni Morri-
son, and Gwendolyn Brooks; all of whom have 
each in their own way, whether through coura-
geous activism, cultural or intellectual contribu-
tions, or artistic creativity, forged social and 
political change, and forever changed our 
great Nation for the better. 
Shirley Chisholm became the first African 
American woman elected to Congress, when 
she was elected to represent the New York’s 
Twelfth Congressional District in 1968 running 
on the slogan, ‘‘Fighting Shirley Chisholm: 
Unbought and Unbossed.’’ 
She reflected that spirit well during her 14 
years in Congress. 
Before Shirley Chisolm, no black woman 
had ever served in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives or the U.S. Senate but following 
in her footsteps are 51 black women Members 
of Congress, two black women U.S. Senators, 
including the president of that body and Vice- 
President of the United States; 23 Hispanic 
members; and 15 Asian-Pacific members, 
along with the first woman Speaker of the 
House, and mayors of several of the largest 
cities in the nation, including the District of Co-
lumbia, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta, New 
Orleans, Baltimore, Hartford, Minneapolis, San 
Antonio, and St. Louis. 
Shirley Chisolm had an understanding that 
during those turbulent times the nation re-
quired a determined leader to represent the 
voice of so many Americans who felt dismay 
at their treatment. 
She took an extremely active role in chang-
ing the way women were to be judged from 
that point on. 
She remarked that, ‘‘Women in this country 
must become revolutionaries. We must refuse 
to accept the old, the traditional roles and 
stereotypes.’’

March 16, 2022 
This is a sentiment that I myself take to 
heart, women in this nation are now told they 
have a right to determine the kind of life they 
want to lead; Shirley Chisholm was at the core 
of this movement. 
This past August 26, 2021, we commemo-
rated the 101st anniversary of the ratification 
of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitu-
tion which granted women the right to vote. 
This momentous achievement did not come 
easy or without struggle, for as the great aboli-
tionist and orator, Fredrick Douglas stated: ‘‘If 
there is no struggle, there is no progress 
. . . . Power concedes nothing without a de-
mand. It never did and it never will.’’ 
The fight for women’s suffrage was waged 
over a 72-year period, beginning in Seneca 
Falls, New York at the Seneca Falls Conven-
tion in 1848, and exemplifies the prophetic 
and timeless saying of Margaret Mead that 
one should: 
‘‘Never doubt the ability of handful of com-
mitted persons to change the world. It is the 
only thing that ever has.’’ 
The Seneca Falls Conference was orga-
nized by Lucretia Mott, with others including 
Mary McClintock and Sojourner Truth, who 
went on to establish herself not only as a 
great advocate for women’s suffrage but also 
as a great abolitionist. 
Among the courageous suffragists who 
spearheaded the movement were Alice Paul, 
who fearlessly executed the National Women’s 
Party picketing protests, and conceived the 
hunger-strike in prison; Carrie Chapman Catt, 
who devised the ‘‘winning plan’’ at the Atlantic 
City Convention; and Ida B. Wells-Barnett, 
whose political activism and criticism of the 
suffrage leadership for excluding black women 
led to a more inclusive and effective move-
ment. 
In 1916, four years before the ratification of 
the 19th Amendment, Jeannette Rankin was 
elected to the U.S. House of Representatives 
from Montana, the first woman elected to fed-
eral office in American history. 
A little over a century later, a record number 
of women serve in the House of Representa-
tives, comprising 23.4% of the chamber’s vot-
ing members, and presided over by NANCY 
PELOSI, the first and only woman elected 
Speaker of the House. 
In the 117th Congress, about 37% of 
women are women of color, and since 1964, 
more than 70 women of color have been 
elected to Congress. 
Although there remains much work to do to 
ensure that women enjoy full blessings of lib-
erty and equality, that should not detract from 
the achievements and contributions to the 
greatness of our country made by American 
women, including Sally Kristen Ride, the first 
woman sent into space; Eileen Marie Collins, 
the first woman space shuttle pilot; Grace 
Murray Hopper, an American computer sci-
entist and United States Navy rear admiral; 
and Katherine Johnson, one of the unsung he-
roes of the NASA Space Program, whose 
mathematical calculations helped the United 
States win the Space Race. 
Nor should we forget that the current Vice- 
President of the United States is KAMALA D. 
HARRIS, Vice President HARRIS is the first 
woman, the first Black American, and the first 
South Asian American to be elected as Vice 
President. 
Similarly, we should remember that just five 
short years ago, Hillary Clinton shattered one 
glass ceiling when she became the first 
woman nominated as the presidential can-
didate of a major political party and came 
within 80,000 votes of winning the presidency 
and thus shattering the ultimate glass ceiling. 
American women will break this ceiling in 
the not distant future, drawing inspiration from 
trailblazers in other nations such as Golda 
Meir of Israel, Indira Ghandi of India, Ellen 
Sirleaf of Liberia, Margaret Thatcher of Great 
Britain, Angela Merkel of Germany, and Portia 
Simpson-Miller of Jamaica, among many oth-
ers. 
In my home city of Houston, there are nu-
merous men and women who are great be-
cause they have heeded the counsel of Dr. 
King who said: 
‘‘Everybody can be great because anybody 
can serve. You only need a heart full of grace. 
A soul generated by love.’’ 
One barrier left to fall, however, is one of 
the most important, and that is membership on 
the Supreme Court of the United States. 
For most of our national history, presidents 
and senators have turned a deaf ear to Abigail 
Adams’ plea to her husband ‘‘to remember the 
ladies and be more generous and favorable to 
them than your ancestors.’’ 
Since Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s 1981 
appointment, only a small handful of women 
have been nominated to the High Court during 
this time, despite the fact that women con-
stitute a majority of the general population, 
37% of all attorneys in America, a number that 
will soon exceed the majority since a substan-
tial majority (54%) of all law students in Amer-
ica are women. 
With Associate Justice Stephen Breyer’s re-
tirement announcement, President Biden and 
the U.S. Senate, now have been presented 
and should move quickly to capitalize on this 
opportunity to begin to rectify the High Court’s 
gender and racial imbalance and to diversify 
its composition by confirming a member of the 
most 
underrepresented, 
disadvantaged, 
marginalized, longest suffering, and most pa-
tient demographic in America: black women. 
Longer than any other racial or ethnic 
group, black women have been subjected to 
the coercive powers of the law while being ex-
cluded from the opportunities to make the 
laws citizens are to live under. 
President Biden has made a nomination for 
the ages in selecting U.S. Circuit Court Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as U.S. Su-
preme Court Associate Justice. 
Not only does Judge Jackson possess one 
of the finest legal minds of her generation, her 
commitment to equal justice, the rule of law, 
and Constitution is unsurpassed. 
Judge Jackson will be a great Justice and a 
role model to women and girls everywhere, 
especially little black girls, that in America all 
things are possible with hard work and deter-
mination. 
With this nomination, we are taking a mas-
sive step towards having a government whose 
institutions, including and especially the Su-
preme Court, are comprised of persons that 
look like the American people. 
I applaud President Biden for making this 
historic nomination and urge the Senate to 
conduct a fair, impartial, and expeditious con-
firmation 
proceeding 
and 
confirm 
Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson—who has already 
been confirmed on a bipartisan basis three 
times. 
As we celebrated Black History Month and 
now Women’s History Month, let us pay tribute 
to those who have come before us, and pay 
forward to future generations by addressing 
what is the number one issue for African 
American families, and all American families 
today: preserving the American promise of 
equal opportunity for all. 
And it is crucial that as we reflect on how 
far women have come, we also not lose sight 
of how far we have to go and what must be 
done to achieve true gender and racial equal-
ity so every girl everywhere can pursue her 
dreams and realize her potential. 
As we progress through Women’s History 
Month, let us summon the extraordinary cour-
age and resilience of the many women who 
came before us. 
Democrats will never relent as we carry on 
the fight for full equality—not only for our na-
tion’s daughters, but for women and girls all 
over the world. 
As the legendary Congresswoman Shirley 
Chisholm said, ‘‘If they don’t give you a seat 
at the table, bring a folding chair.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, on Homeland Security, and on the 
Budget, and the Congressional Women’s Cau-
cus, I am pleased to join this Women’s Cau-
cus Special Order with my colleagues, to dis-
cuss the bravery of Ukrainian women and girls 
in the face of Russia’s war against Ukraine. 
I thank the Co-Chairs of the CWC, Rep-
resentatives DEAN and GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N, for 
their leadership of the Bipartisan Congres-
sional Women’s Caucus. 
Firstly, I would like to commend all Ukrain-
ians for their outstanding bravery. It is truly in-
spirational for Americans, and for people 
around the world. America stands with you. 
Russia’s launch of a premeditated war 
against Ukraine is an attack on democracy 
and a grave violation of international law, glob-
al peace, and security. 
The fighting has sparked massive displace-
ment and has forced over two million Ukrain-
ians to flee their homes to neighboring states 
and has put women and girls at heightened 
risk of violence. 
Although many people have fled, millions 
have stayed behind to help fight the Russian 
invaders and defend Ukrainian sovereignty. 
Thousands of Ukrainian women have taken 
up arms and are playing a vital role in 
Ukraine’s national defense. Today they make 
up 22.8% of the Ukrainian army, not including 
the thousands who have volunteered as civil-
ian soldiers. 
Life in the military is not easy for women. 
While women have been serving in the 
Ukrainian military since the annexation of Cri-
mea in 2014, they did not win the right to offi-
cially fight alongside their male counterparts 
until 2017. 
When Russian-backed forces seized part of 
the Donbas region and conflict ensued in 
2014, thousands of women volunteered to 
help the Ukrainian military. They served as as-
sault troops, medics, and snipers. 
But the sacrifices made by these women 
went largely unrecognized. Official documents 
issued by the Ukrainian military, listed these 
soldiers as seamstresses, cooks, and janitors. 
The women who volunteered ‘‘often found 
themselves outside legal protection,’’ accord-
ing to the Invisible Battalion, an advocacy 
group for Ukrainian servicewomen, that stud-
ied women’s roles in the war against Russia.

March 16, 2022 
Although these women have not always 
been adequately supported by their govern-
ment because of soviet era laws forbidding 
them from enlisting, they have persisted. 
In 2017 a group of women veterans got to-
gether and lobbied for their rights, which 
brought about a much-needed change in the 
culture in the Ukrainian military. 
Just last year the Ukrainian Ministry of De-
fense determined that female soldiers march-
ing in a military parade celebrating independ-
ence from the Soviet Union would wear high 
heels, not boots. 
Regardless of the numerous hurdles and 
mockeries Ukrainian women have faced and 
continue to face today, there are thousands 
who are putting their lives at risk to protect 
and defend their homeland. 
Among them have been a 79-year-old 
woman who recently learned how to fire a 
gun, a former beauty queen Anastasia Lenna, 
who represented Ukraine at the 2015 Miss 
Grand International pageant—and Kristina, a 
former wedding singer. 
Kristina was living in Italy last summer when 
tensions between Ukraine and Russia rose. 
While knowing the security risks, Kristina re-
turned to her country to become a soldier. 
She told a VICE news reporter that ‘‘The 
risk of saying goodbye to life is always there, 
[and she is] not afraid of death; [she] is afraid 
to [become a slave].’’ Words that will forever 
stick with me. 
Women’s History Month is a celebration of 
women’s contributions to history, culture and 
society, and there is no better example of this 
than those women fighting in Ukraine today. 
So, on this day, March 9, 2022, I would like 
to publicly commend the women fighting in 
Ukraine for their boundless courage and brav-
ery. The world stands with you and will con-
tinue to fight alongside you to put an end to 
Putin’s cruel parade. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I would just say that 
it is a joy to be on the floor with Rep-
resentative JACKSON LEE. I thank the 
gentlewoman very, very much. She 
makes my job very easy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield again to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the leader of our caucus, Ms. 
FRANKEL. 
Madam Speaker, I am just going to 
close with some expectations. I am 
leaving Congress this year, and I want 
to convey to you, Madam Speaker, to 
the leadership of the Democratic Wom-
en’s Caucus, and to all of my col-
leagues how important I think that 
you are as guardians of womanhood. 
Our job is never done. 
So while we may celebrate these 
small victories from time to time, the 
ERA is not part of our Constitution. Of 
the 193 countries in the world, 165 have 
the ERA in their Constitutions. The 
United States does not. It is 24 little 
words. Thirty-eight States have passed 
it. We have this deadline that we have 
struck from the legislation in the 
House. The Senate has not taken it up. 
Femicide is a huge problem in Latin 
America. The Democratic Women’s 
Caucus will have a presentation this 
Friday on that. The 5,000 missing Na-
tive-American women in this country 
that really we had no cognizance of 
until we had a Native-American woman 
in the Congress to talk about it. 
Finally, a new issue—probably not a 
new issue—is one that has just per-
colated to the surface, and that is fe-
male inmates in Federal prisons who 
are raped by the wardens, the chap-
lains, and the guards. Congresswoman 
BASS, Congressman SWALWELL, and I 
went to the Federal correctional insti-
tution in Dublin this week. 
Now, at that one prison, the warden 
had raped inmates, the chaplain had 
raped inmates, and two of the guards 
that we know of had raped inmates. 
It is profound that we change the cul-
ture in these prisons to prevent that 
from happening and from the training 
of guards and leadership at those facili-
ties to treat these women with a cer-
tain amount of dignity that you would 
just provide to another human being. 
What we heard about the kinds of 
things that are said about them—they 
are called hos and called just horrible 
things that make us realize that we 
still have a lot of work to do. 
So as I conclude, let me just say, 
Madam Speaker, that we are the guard-
ians of womanhood for the future, and 
I will look on with fondness and great 
appreciation. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. I 
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship. She will be missed. I know she 
will go on to bigger and better things. 
She has made her mark in the history 
of this country for sure. 
I want to thank my colleagues, SHEI-
LA JACKSON LEE and JACKIE SPEIER, for 
coming to the floor. They gave us a 
great education tonight, and I appre-
ciate that. 
I will conclude, Madam Speaker, the 
way I started, which is I thank all 
those millions and millions of unknown 
women who lift us up every day, who 
dry our tears, and who share our happi-
ness with that unconditional love, and 
those are our mothers who are prob-
ably, as I said, the most influential 
part of the history of the world. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Let us pray. 
Eternal God, whose might can save 
us, we trust You to deliver the Ukrain-

shoot from the shadows. 
Lord, we have trusted You in the 
past, when everything seemed to be 
falling apart. We continue to look to 
Your throne in Heaven for courage to 
face the worst that sin can do. 
Lord, give our lawmakers wisdom to 
be strong and courageous in these dan-
gerous times. Remind them that You 
have not given us a spirit of fear but 
power, love, and self-discipline. 
Help us, Lord. We trust Your prom-

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, mo-
ments ago, speaking through a video 
feed from Kyiv, Ukrainian President 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed Mem-
bers of both the House and the Senate 
as the war in Ukraine enters its 21st 
awful day. 
It is one of the highest honors of any 
Congress to welcome remarks by a for-
eign head of state, but it is unheard of 
to hear from a leader fighting for his 
life, fighting for his country’s future, 
and fighting to preserve the very idea 
of democracy. 
I cannot remember the last time a 
foreign leader united a room full of 
Members from both sides so quickly 
and so intensely. He spoke not just to 
American ears but to America’s very 
soul. In one sense, his speech was remi-
niscent of the stirring feeling all of us 
had in the aftermath of 9/11: equal 
parts resolve and unity and determina-
tion to save democracy from an hour of 
darkness. 
As we have said from the start of the 
war, the Senate, the Congress, and the 
American people stand unequivocally 
behind the people of Ukraine. America 
will continue to strengthen our NATO 
allies and reassure our friends in Eu-
rope that we will remain a steady ally. 
It is why, last week, Congress approved 
nearly $14 billion for food, shelter, 
money for Javelins and Stingers and 
anti-aircraft weapons and refugee help. 
Every last penny that the United 
States sends to Ukraine is money well 
spent. 
This morning, it is reported that 
President Biden will also announce an-
other $800 million in military assist-
ance. This means even more anti-tank, 
anti-aircraft missiles and other weap-
ons that have been the most effective 
on the battlefield for the Ukrainians. 
Last night, the Senate also unani-
mously passed legislation supporting 
investigations by the International 
Criminal Court into potential war 
crimes by Putin and his regime. I 
thank Senator GRAHAM and the many, 
many others who backed this bill. The 
Senate also confirmed the Ambassador- 
at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, 
our lead advocate in making sure this 
investigation is robust and it is swift. 
These steps are all necessary. Over 
the last 2 weeks, we have seen Putin 
attack the largest nuclear plant in Eu-
rope, attack the Chernobyl contain-
ment site, attack a children’s hospital, 
and attack designated humanitarian 
convoys. Putin, so far, is not winning 
militarily so now this evil man is try-
ing to win by massacring civilians; 
massacring babies; parents, the elderly; 
and targeting apartments, just as he 
did 
in 
Syria, 
just 
as 
he 
did 
in 
Chechnya. If this doesn’t equal a war 
crime, I don’t know what does. 
If it wasn’t clear before, it should be 
clear now that President Putin and his

band of cronies are not going to stop. 
But in his monomaniacal hubris, Putin 
has 
severely—severely—underesti-
mated the Ukrainian people. Every 
time an innocent Ukrainian is killed, 
the resolve of the people grows strong-
er, and we stand with them. I join my 
colleagues in one voice to say this: 
‘‘Slava Ukraini,’’ glory to Ukraine. 
And, Mr. President, just seeing the 
video that the President showed us is 
heartbreaking and strengthens our re-
solve. Putin, by being such a villain, by 
being such a brutal, evil man, is not 
going to deter the Ukrainians, for sure, 
and not the American people from 
helping Ukraine. It strengthens our re-
solve when we see how vicious, how 
brutal he is. 
COSTS 
Mr. President, now, on another issue, 
this morning I want to highlight two 
steps Senate Democrats are taking to 
maintain our laser focus on lowering 
costs for American families. 
First, today the Senate Finance 
Committee is holding a hearing exam-
ining one of the most vexing issues fac-
ing Americans everywhere: the alarm-
ing rise in prescription drug costs. Few 
things are as frustrating and debili-
tating as going to the pharmacy and 
seeing the price on your receipt go up 
and up and up for essential medica-
tions. 
For families struggling to make ends 
meet, drug costs present a harrowing 
Sophie’s choice. Do I buy groceries and 
diapers and take care of my kids, or do 
I pay for my medications? It is a deci-
sion no American should make, but 
millions have to make it every day. 
Insulin is a particularly flummoxing 
example. According to some sources, a 
40-day supply can now climb north of 
$600 a month. For millions of Ameri-
cans who rely on insulin to manage 
their diabetes, this is a crisis that 
should compel the Senate to act. I ex-
pect that we will consider next steps 
soon on proposals already presented to 
my colleagues. 
And besides rising prescription drug 
costs, Senate Democrats are zeroing in 
on the alarming state of energy prices. 
In the coming weeks, I expect that 
Congress will be calling on CEOs from 
the oil and gas companies to testify on 
the alarming spike in energy prices. 
Over the past few weeks, as war in 
Ukraine began, the price of a barrel of 
oil rose precipitously. That imme-
diately translated to oil and gas com-
panies raising the price for Americans 
at the pump. But something is hap-
pening that Americans shouldn’t over-
look. Over the past few days, oil prices 
have actually been decreasing, but the 
price of gas at the pump has not. 
Some of the economists call this 
stickiness. When the costs go up, the 
price to the consumer goes up; when 
the costs go down, the price to the con-
sumer stays high. Stickiness does not 
come close to describing the outrage 
that Americans feel about this. 
The last time that the price of a bar-
rel of oil was at $96, gas was $3.62 a gal-
lon. Oil prices have now come down to 
$96 again. Yet the price of gas con-
tinues to rise. It is now at $4.31. The be-
wildering incongruity between falling 
oil prices and rising gas prices smacks 
of price-gouging and is deeply dam-
aging to working Americans. 
The Senate is going to get answers, 
and that is why we will be calling on 
the CEOs of major oil companies to 
come testify before the Congress. 
Meanwhile, as Americans pay more 
at the pump, the biggest oil companies 
in America are making a killing. 
Twenty-five of the top oil and gas com-
panies reported a combined $205 billion 
in profits. That is an astounding figure, 
blowing prepandemic figures out of the 
water. But instead of lowering gas 
prices, oil companies are using these 
soaring profits to reward their share-
holders through stock buybacks. It is 
outrageous to me. Stock buybacks— 
they benefit the CEOs because they can 
tell the shareholders, ‘‘See, the price 
went up.’’ But it is not because they 
sold more product, became more effi-
cient, hired more workers, used produc-
tivity. It is simply decreasing the num-
ber of shares so the price goes up. That, 
to me, is so wrong. It is one of the dis-
turbing signs of American capitalism. 
These disturbing trends demand an-
swers, and the CEOs of large oil and 
gas companies should be advised they 
will have to provide answers before the 
Senate very soon: Why stock buybacks 
instead of lowering prices or increasing 
productivity or moving to green en-
ergy, which we know we all have to do? 
And finally, in conclusion, another 
issue on prices. The Senate will also 
take action on the bottlenecks and 
supply chain crisis crippling our ship-
ping lines. Senator CANTWELL and the 
Commerce Committee will be holding a 
markup on March 22 on bipartisan leg-
islation introduced by Senators KLO-
BUCHAR and THUNE that will target this 
issue—one of the many, many ways 
that Democrats are continuing our 
focus on lowering costs for American 
families. 
So these are some concrete steps we 
are taking. We are going to hear about 
many more as Democrats focus keen-
ly—laser-like—on the higher costs for 
the American people, which we know 
must, must come down. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
morning, Members of Congress received 
an update on the situation in Ukraine 
directly from President Zelenskyy. His 
presentation was powerful and heart- 
wrenching. It reinforced our sympathy, 
our outrage, and our resolve. 
President Zelenskyy’s courage and 
leadership have earned the attention 
and the admiration of the entire free 
world. He has marshaled Ukraine’s 
brave and defiant resistance against 
Russian invasion. He has steeled the 
resolve of his people beyond what any-
body expected and offered the entire 
world a master class in leadership. 
This morning, President Zelenskyy 
didn’t mince words about what Ukraine 
needs urgently to keep up the fight: 
more lethal capabilities and heavier 
sanctions against Russia and especially 
the air defense systems that we should 
have helped Ukraine get weeks ago. His 
people face a long and difficult road 
ahead, and the entire world knows 
what they are up against. 
The scale of Russia’s aggression 
wasn’t just foreseeable; it was foreseen. 
For 30 years, every step toward democ-
racy and sovereignty in Eastern Eu-
rope has tempted the wrath of revanch-
ist autocrats like Putin. That is why I 
have asked the Biden administration 
early and often to demonstrate Amer-
ica’s commitment to our allies and 
partners most squarely in Russia’s 
crosshairs. 
Last June, 8 months before the Rus-
sian invasion, I urged the President to 
‘‘provide serious, lethal support to 
Ukraine and other vulnerable states on 
the front lines of Putin’s aggres-
sions’’—8 months ago. In December, I 
specifically called on President Biden 
to deploy extra U.S. forces to reinforce 
NATO’s eastern flank—last December. 
I urged his administration to expedite 
and expand shipments of lethal aid like 
anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons. 
But, as we know, a security assistance 
package for Ukraine sat down at the 
White House for months before being 
approved. Once approved, efforts to 
transfer the weapons moved at the 
speed of bureaucracy. And the Presi-
dent waited until February to order 
U.S. personnel to the frontlines. 
The Biden administration had over a 
year to get this right. They had a year 
to translate rhetorical support for 
NATO into leading real, collective de-
fense. But they took 5 months to even 
nominate an ambassador to the alli-
ance. 
On the campaign trail, President 
Biden called Putin a ‘‘KGB thug.’’ He 
was right about that. But after 1 week 
in office, he announced an agreement 
with the Kremlin to extend the New 
START treaty for up to 5 years, reduc-
ing our leverage to get a better deal 
that caps Putin’s nuclear ambitions. 
As the threats to Ukraine gathered, 
whenever an opportunity to act has 
presented itself, the Biden administra-
tion has hesitated until political pres-
sure became overwhelming or balked 
outright. 
Since Russia’s invasion began, the 
administration has publicly shot down 
efforts from a NATO ally to get work-
ing aircraft to Ukrainian pilots. Last

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1195 
March 16, 2022 
Monday, the White House scuttled a bi-
partisan congressional bill to end nor-
mal trade relations with Russia, only 
to make a public show on Friday of 
calling for exactly the same action. 
At every step of the way—every step 
of the way—the self-deterred White 
House has insisted its hesitation and 
restraint was aimed at avoiding esca-
lation, but at every step, Putin has es-
calated. 
Now, 3 weeks into Putin’s invasion, 
the reality on the ground is evolving. 
It is harder now than it would have 
been a few months ago to keep the 
pipeline of weapons and supplies and 
intelligence for Ukraine’s brave resist-
ance open. Russia’s air offensive in par-
ticular is hitting a deadlier, more ag-
gressive stride. But, as I have been say-
ing literally for months, it is not too 
late for the Biden administration to do 
the right thing. So here is what Presi-
dent Biden should be doing right now: 
No. 1, he should use the money and 
authorities we have just provided him 
to expand the scope of our lethal aid to 
Ukraine to include more effective, 
longer range air defense capabilities. 
That means working with NATO allies 
with urgency to get Ukrainian pilots 
more aircraft and munitions and facili-
tating 
the 
transfer 
of 
weapons 
Ukraine’s forces are most familiar 
with, like air defense systems from 
countries with stockpiles of Soviet leg-
acy systems. President Zelenskyy spe-
cifically pleaded for these air defense 
systems this morning—this morning. 
No. 2, President Biden should deploy 
more U.S. forces to reinforce NATO’s 
eastern flank and use the new draw-
down and loan guarantee authorities to 
help harden the defenses of our front-
line allies and partners. Many of these 
partners 
are 
generously 
helping 
Ukraine, and we should help them 
backfill their inventories with more 
modern American capabilities that will 
improve NATO’s interoperability and 
bolster deterrence at the same time. 
No. 3, on a trip to Europe next week, 
President Biden should go beyond 
Brussels. He should go to countries like 
Poland, Romania, or Lithuania to meet 
with NATO eastern flank allies. He 
should look beyond NATO to deepen 
our diplomatic security cooperation 
with important American partners like 
Finland and Sweden. 
Finally, if President Biden wants the 
United States to lead our allies by ex-
ample and to keep pace with adver-
saries like Russia and China, the place 
to start is with robust investments in 
our own defense capabilities. The com-
ing year’s appropriations process is an 
opportunity to finally—finally—show 
we are serious. 
Vladimir Putin has proven to the 
world that he is willing to stoop low in 
pursuit of power, and he has shown us 
exactly—exactly—how he responds to 
weakness. We cannot afford to stay be-
hind the curve. America must lead and 
lead with strength. 
A 
few 
minutes 
ago, 
President 
Zelenskyy reminded us that the United 
States is, indeed, the leader of the free 
world, so it is time we acted like it. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
last week marked 1 year since Demo-
crats rammed $2 trillion of runaway 
liberal spending through the Senate on 
a party-line vote. Working families 
were certainly not celebrating this par-
ticular anniversary; they were too busy 
contending with the worst inflation in 
modern American history, unleashed in 
large part by that very bill. 
Democrats’ policies have conjured up 
the worst inflation in 40 years. Con-
sumer prices rose 0.8 percent in the 
month of February alone. Annual infla-
tion hit 7.9 percent. It is still getting 
worse. We just learned yesterday that 
the Producer Price Index, which meas-
ures inflation upstream at the whole-
sale level, is up 10 percent—10 per-
cent—since last year. 
This is hammering American fami-
lies. Experts estimate that inflation 
alone is costing the average household 
more than $296 every single month— 
the equivalent of an extra $300 monthly 
bill courtesy of Democratic policies. 
No wonder almost 60 percent of Ameri-
cans say inflation is causing them per-
sonal financial pain and the Demo-
crats’ approval ratings on the economy 
are way underwater. Even with a lit-
eral land war in Europe, the Demo-
crats’ inflation is so painful that infla-
tion and not Ukraine still tops the 
American people’s biggest list of con-
cerns. 
From the gas pump to the grocery 
store, to clothes, diapers, and baby for-
mula, to furniture and home essentials, 
to car repairs and car replacements, 
Democrats’ policies have put working 
families on a treadmill where they 
have to run faster and faster every 
month just to stay in place. Rent 
prices are spiking faster than they 
have since 1991. Grocery prices are 
soaring faster than they have since 
1981. New cars and truck prices are 
climbing at their fastest rates ever. 
Forget about getting ahead and sav-
ing—households are lucky if they are 
even able to tread water. 
Lately, Democrats have launched a 
shameless 
campaign 
to 
blame 
12 
months of inflation not on 12 months of 
their bad policies but instead on the 
last 3 weeks’ crisis in Europe. The 
White House informs us that ‘‘Putin’s 
price hike’’ is the culprit. Of course, 
that is utter nonsense. Even liberal ex-
perts are rejecting their shameless 
spin. 
A former top economist for President 
Obama directly responded to the Biden 
administration’s attempt to shift the 
blame. He said: 
Well— 
This is what he said— 
Well, no. These are February numbers and 
only include [a] small Russia effect. This is 
Biden’s inflation and he needs to own it. 
The White House spin has not even 
persuaded former Democratic officials. 
Here is another quote: 
This is Biden’s inflation and he needs to 
own it. 
Working Americans understand it 
just as well as the experts. Everybody 
knows where the buck stops. One re-
tired mechanic who lives in Los Ange-
les recently explained to a reporter 
that he is facing $6 gasoline and rising 
food prices. He is a registered Demo-
crat, but he knows where this inflation 
came from. Here is how he described it. 
He said: 
Uncle Joe has put us on a diet. I like to 
have a steak once or twice a month. I can’t 
do it now. 
This is exactly what Republicans said 
would happen when Democrats dumped 
trillions of dollars into printing and 
spending on a partisan basis last year. 
Even top liberal economists said Demo-
crats’ reckless spending spree would 
bring about inflationary pressures like 
we have not seen for a generation. 
Ah, but Democrats didn’t listen. 
They pushed ahead, and, for 12 months 
and counting, working families have 
been paying a heavy price. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Re-
publican leader referred to the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, which did not receive 
a single Republican vote in support. He 
referred to it as runaway Federal 
spending. 
What did we buy with the American 
Rescue Plan? 
We bought vaccines, and we bought 
an administration and management of 
delivering those vaccines to the Amer-
ican people in the midst of a pandemic 
that was claiming American lives 
every day. 
Runaway 
Federal 
spending—how 
much stronger would this Nation be if 
we were still in the depths of this pan-
demic? 
We are emerging from it, thank God. 
But it wasn’t for lack of effort on our 
part on this side of the aisle. 
Yes, we spent the money. We admin-
istered the shots, and people across 
America are now protected from hos-
pitalizations and death because of it. 
No apologies here to my colleague from 
Kentucky. It was money well spent, 
not just for that—and that was the 
number one public health purpose— 
but, secondly, to keep businesses afloat 
so they can reopen their doors as the 
pandemic ebbed. 
That investment in the capital of 
America, in the businesses of America, 
paid off for business owners who other-
wise would have lost their life savings 
and family investments and for their 
workers who finally returned to work. 
I think it helped the small busi-
nesses, and I think it helped the fami-
lies. The child tax credit, which cut in 
half child poverty in America—that 
child tax credit, according to the Sen-
ator from Kentucky, was runaway Fed-
eral spending. Tell that to the family 
who lives paycheck to paycheck and 
tries to provide the basics in life for 
their children. No apologies here for 
the American Rescue Plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1196 
March 16, 2022 
And when you ask the American peo-
ple, ‘‘What about this inflation,’’ it is a 
problem. Of course, it is. We see it as 
they do. And we see it all across the 
world. Inflation isn’t confined to the 
United States. It is reflected in a world 
that is emerging from COVID–19, where 
economies—local 
economies—were 
strangled and choked and restricted. 
Now, they are expanding. People are 
expanding their needs and spending on 
that side of it. If the supply doesn’t 
keep up with it, then inflation results. 
We have a battle ahead of us and many 
plans here to try to address it with a 
number of items to reduce the cost of 
living for families. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, the second item I 
would like to mention refers to a mov-
ing, historic presentation this morning 
by the President of Ukraine to a joint 
session of Congress. 
He did it virtually by remote because 
he is literally in Kyiv, risking his life 
every single day for his nation. 
Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy 
may 
have 
started his life as a standup comedian, 
but at this moment in life, he is a 
standup President of Ukraine, who is 
confronting the monster of Moscow 
who has unleashed this invasion on his 
country. He begged us to continue to 
help, and we will. 
Last week, we added almost $14 bil-
lion to the effort to support the 
Ukrainian defense and resistance. We 
need to do that and more. 
Many of the suggestions by the Re-
publican Senator are consistent with 
that goal, and I would endorse it. But I 
want to leave it to President Biden to 
make the critical decisions as our 
Commander in Chief who is really 
tasked with America’s national secu-
rity as his highest priority. 
I take exception to this notion that 
Joe Biden didn’t understand the timing 
of this crisis. He understood it better 
than anyone. He knew that if he pushed 
too far and too fast, two things might 
occur: first, that the Russians would 
move because we had precipitated it 
with an action we had taken. He was 
hoping, as we all did, that this could be 
ended bloodlessly and that an innocent 
people would be saved from what we 
see, the devastation that is happening 
in Ukraine today. So he was careful to 
make those moves in a way that Putin 
couldn’t use them as an excuse for 
starting the invasion. 
Second, and more important, he 
needed to move at a pace consistent 
with 
building 
the 
NATO 
alliance. 
President Joe Biden succeeded in that 
effort. The NATO alliance today is 
stronger than it has ever been. Don’t 
believe the last President of the United 
States had anything to do with that, 
just the opposite was true. 
Joe Biden picked up that alliance 
from the mat and brought them up to 
fighting trim, to be ready, if needed, to 
‘‘defend every square inch,’’ as he says, 
‘‘of NATO territory.’’ That timing was 
crucial. And decisions which seem so 
easy and obvious in America were 
much more complex on the continent 
of Europe. Joe Biden knew that, and he 
paced himself accordingly. And because 
of that today, we have the strongest al-
liance in the face of Vladimir Putin 
that he has ever seen and that we have 
ever seen. 
The last point I want to make to 
this, you could not watch the graphic 
video 
presented 
by 
President 
Zelenskyy 
without 
breaking 
your 
heart. Every parent and grandparent in 
America watching that video saw a 
member of his family, a child, a lifeless 
corpse because of a man named Vladi-
mir Putin and what he is doing to that 
poor country. Unprovoked, he has in-
vaded them and kills innocent people 
every single day. 
Last night, unanimously, the Senate 
decided, as they should, that the con-
duct of Vladimir Putin was nothing 
short of a war crime. I can’t think of 
any other way to describe it and cer-
tainly never excuse it. 
Zelenskyy touched our hearts too. 
His people are fighting a valiant effort, 
and the United States and allies and 
countries that share our values stand 
behind him and will continue to. 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2022 
Mr. President, I am honored to join 
my colleagues Senators MURKOWSKI 
and ERNST and, of course, my friend 
and colleague Senator FEINSTEIN
to 
celebrate the reauthorization of the Vi-
olence Against Women Act, more com-
monly known as VAWA. Yesterday, 
President Biden signed it into law. 
This is a monumental achievement for 
the survivors of domestic sexual vio-
lence and those who stand by them. 
It is an achievement that wouldn’t 
have been possible without bipartisan 
cooperation. It, literally, would not 
have been possible. I have been proud 
to work with my three colleagues 
whom I mentioned. 
With this strengthened version of 
VAWA, we have helped to ensure that 
every survivor in America, no matter 
where they live, will be able to reach 
for a lifeline in a moment of crisis. We 
have expanded and authorized services 
for rural survivors, survivors who need 
culturally 
specific 
services, 
and 
LGBTQ survivors. We have reauthor-
ized programs that ensure survivors 
and their families can access housing, 
healthcare, and essential support serv-
ices. We have improved rape prevention 
and education, as well as services and 
protections for young survivors. We 
have enhanced critical protections for 
Native American women and children 
who experience violence at the hands of 
non-Native perpetrators. 
It doesn’t include everything we had 
hoped for. That is the nature of legisla-
tion and compromise. I wish there had 
been stronger protections for housing 
and economic assistance, but we had to 
find an agreement, and we did. 
The bill contains several important 
provisions to help boost enforcement of 
our gun laws. I wish it would have fi-
nally closed the so-called ‘‘boyfriend 
loophole,’’ but that was beyond our 
reach in this effort. 
The lack of those provisions could 
not attract enough bipartisan support 
in the Senate to pass on their own. 
They will be saved for another day. 
For nearly 30 years, VAWA has trans-
formed the way we address domestic 
and sexual violence in America and 
saved countless lives. At a moment 
when nearly one in three women—one 
in three—have experienced some form 
of physical or sexual violence, a crisis 
that has grown worse during the pan-
demic, VAWA is going to help save 
lives. 
Let me tell you a story. My office re-
ceived a letter from a woman named 
Kesha, who works with Connections for 
Abused Women and their Children in 
Chicago. Kesha told me that VAWA 
provides funding for domestic violence 
services at Chicago’s Haymarket Cen-
ter, an amazing agency I know full 
well. 
She shared the story of Cassandra, 
who was receiving treatment at the 
Center for Substance Abuse and dis-
closed to a counselor that she was the 
victim of abusive treatment. Her coun-
selor referred her to VAWA, and that 
program gave her an opportunity to 
‘‘open up about the emotional, finan-
cial, and physical abuse she had suf-
fered for years at the hands of [an] abu-
sive husband.’’ 
Kesha wrote: 
After 
weeks 
of 
domestic 
violence 
psychoeducation, a supportive network en-
couraging her, and her own personal resil-
ience, Cassandra decided that if she wanted 
to remain in recovery and not relapse, [she 
had to find a new home, away from her 
abuser.] With the help of her domestic vio-
lence counselor, Cassandra was able to break 
free and transition into temporary housing. 
She has been able to gain financial 
independence and find a job. She has 
remained on her path to recovery, a 
success story, and a reminder that 
VAWA doesn’t just help save lives, it 
gives survivors the power to rebuild 
their own lives. 
VAWA also provides funding for edu-
cational programming, and it has done 
it so well. 
I want to thank Senator FEINSTEIN, 
Senator ERNST, and Senator MUR-
KOWSKI for their partnership and tire-
less leadership in getting this bill ad-
dressed, introduced, and across the fin-
ish line. 
I want to thank their staff: Jessica 
Jensen, 
Senator 
FEINSTEIN’s 
chief 
counsel, as well as Nick Xenakis, her 
former chief counsel; Corey Becker and 
Kristina Sesek, Senator ERNST’s legis-
lative director and general counsel; and 
Anna Dietderich, Senator MURKOWSKI’s 
legislative assistant. 
On my Judiciary Committee staff, I 
would like to give thanks especially to 
Stephanie Trifone and Nicole McClain 
Walton and Chastidy Burns. 
I want to thank the other members 
of the committees of jurisdiction and 
their staffs, along with Ranking Mem-
ber MURKOWSKI and the minority staff 
on 
the 
Indian 
Affairs 
Committee,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1197 
March 16, 2022 
chaired by BRIAN SCHATZ. They have 
done an extraordinarily good job, a bi-
partisan job, when it comes to Native 
Americans. 
Chair MURRAY and the staff of the 
HELP Committee, Chair BROWN
and 
the staff of the Banking Committee, 
Chair WYDEN and the staff of the Fi-
nance Committee were part of this vic-
tory. 
As you can see, this was a multicom-
mittee team effort on both sides of the 
aisle, and that is the only reason we 
can stand here today and say we will 
continue to give hope to those who are 
struggling with domestic violence and 
abuse. 
I ask unanimous consent that Sen-
ators ERNST, MURKOWSKI, and FEIN-
STEIN be permitted to speak for up to 10 
minutes each prior to the cloture vote 
on the Corely nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I want to 
thank my colleagues Senator DURBIN, 
Senator FEINSTEIN, and Senator MUR-
KOWSKI for joining me on the floor this 
morning to talk about a very impor-
tant topic and one that we can finally 
celebrate, which is the passage and the 
signing of the Violence Against Women 
Act. 
Nine years—it has been 9 years since 
the Violence Against Women Act was 
reauthorized, but, finally, the Senate 
reauthorized and modernized this very 
important bill. 
Last week, the Violence Against 
Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022 
passed the House and the Senate, and 
yesterday, at long last, it was signed 
into law. 
I have been a proud champion of this 
bill over the last 3 years. And while no 
bill is perfect, I am extremely grateful 
for the bipartisan work to get it over 
the finish line. 
This bill is personal. Many of you 
know my story. I am the one out of 
three women who has experienced some 
form of physical violence by an inti-
mate partner. 
Similarly, one in four men have had 
the same experience. This means near-
ly 20 people per minute, more than 10 
million women and men in the United 
States every single year have suffered 
this horrific personal abuse. 
I am not a victim. I am a survivor. It 
took me a long time to say those words 
out loud. And my hope is that with this 
bill some women will never have to, 
and those who do will have the nec-
essary support and resources in a mo-
ment of crisis to cope with and ulti-
mately overcome their trauma. 
The reauthorization of the Violence 
Against Women Act is a bright light in 
our current troubling reality. 
The bill includes so many critical re-
sources, especially in our rural commu-
nities, that have been drastically over-
looked. 
Specifically, the bill doubles the sup-
port for both the rural domestic vio-
lence assistance program and the Rape 
Prevention and Education Program, 
both of which are of great importance 
to my home State of Iowa. 
And my sincere hope is that the re-
sources contained in this new law will 
finally help truly move the needle on 
domestic violence around the country 
and that some of our Nation’s most 
vulnerable will have access to the sup-
port that they so desperately need. 
To my colleagues, thank you, espe-
cially to Senators FEINSTEIN, DURBIN, 
and MURKOWSKI for your diligent work 
on domestic violence-related issues 
over the years. 
I also want to thank Republican Sen-
ators 
CORNYN, 
COLLINS, 
CAPITO, 
PORTMAN, 
CRAMER, 
TILLIS, 
MORAN, 
BURR, and BLUNT for supporting this 
vital bill at introduction. 
The negotiations were, at times—my 
colleagues will recognize this—very 
tough, and there were several doubts 
along the way as to whether the bill 
would actually ever happen. But with a 
little bit of tenacity and good-faith ne-
gotiating, we got there. 
To those who work every day around 
this great country to help domestic vi-
olence survivors, including our law en-
forcement officers who are answering 
those domestic violence calls, thank 
you. 
While working at a victim’s shelter 
answering the hotline in college, I 
heard the heartbreaking stories of 
abuse. I understand this is your daily 
reality. Please know your work is not 
going unnoticed and is making a dif-
ference in the lives of those around 
you. 
To all of the advocates, I greatly ap-
preciate and respect your passion for 
the causes you support. Your persist-
ence made this bill possible, and it 
made this bill better. 
While the end result isn’t perfect, it 
modernizes the resources necessary to 
meet the evolving needs of our sur-
vivors. 
This bill is proof that bipartisanship 
is not dead and Congress can tackle 
these tough issues. 
Finally, for my fellow Americans 
who can say they are survivors, for 
those who have not come to terms with 
their abuse and for those who feel 
trapped in their situation and for those 
who have lost their battle, please know 
that you are not and will never be for-
gotten. The Violence Against Women 
Act is for you. 
Today, I join my fellow survivors, my 
colleagues, and our strong and wonder-
ful advocates across this country in 
celebrating 
VAWA’s 
reauthorization 
and its modernization. 
Thank you to my dear colleagues for 
their wonderful work in helping us get 
this over the finish line. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I so 
appreciate the leadership, the heart of 
Senator ERNST and the ability to work 
with my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle—Senator DURBIN, Senator 
FEINSTEIN—in this effort towards reau-
thorization of the Violence Against 
Women Act. 
Thanks to the very open, very inclu-
sive, and, really, a very transparent 
process that we followed, the bipar-
tisan support that was built with this, 
we were able to include the VAWA re-
authorization in the Omnibus appro-
priations bill that passed the Senate 
last week with 68 votes. 
That wasn’t necessarily the path that 
we had set on. But we had work to do, 
again, with extraordinary leadership 
from Senator ERNST, Senator DURBIN, 
Senator FEINSTEIN, myself, who have 
been working on this for years, but try-
ing to build that collaborative effort, 
that negotiated effort that would re-
sult in not a partisan bill but a bill 
that is designed to help those sur-
vivors, designed to help the most vul-
nerable at their time of need. 
So there is great thanks that is due 
this afternoon as we recognize the dedi-
cation, the leadership of, again, the co-
sponsors, the Members that led this, 
but we all know we are backed by in-
credible men and women who work 
very hard to get these initiatives built 
and across the finish line. 
Senator DURBIN has named many of 
the staffs and general counsels, our leg-
islative assistants that made this hap-
pen. 
I also want to recognize all those who 
were named, in addition to those who 
are working on the Senate Indian Af-
fairs Committee to help us with that 
Tribal title. It was a collaborative ef-
fort that was really, really tireless. 
And I want to acknowledge Senator 
ERNST particularly. She worked tire-
lessly over these last 3 years, working 
to ensure that women and their safe-
ty—and, really, all those who are most 
vulnerable—their safety is put first. 
But to Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator 
DURBIN—invaluable partners putting 
the politics aside, saying: We have to 
figure out how we are going to make 
this happen, and they did so. 
But we and our staff can’t do near 
the job that needs to be done without 
the advocacy and, again, this pas-
sionate grassroots advocacy that we 
have all felt. 
I want to recognize women like Tami 
Jerue from the Alaskan Native Wom-
en’s 
Resource 
Center; 
Michelle 
Demmert, Brenda Stanfield from the 
Alaska Network on Domestic Violence. 
There were so many who urged us 
along—in fact, so many who have flown 
4,000 miles to come from Alaska to be 
at a ceremony at the White House in 
recognition of this. 
So Senator ERNST has said how per-
sonal this issue of domestic violence is, 
and it is for so many. Half the women— 
half the women—in the State of Alaska 
have experienced intimate partner, 
sexual violence, or both. 
The advocates know, I know, we 
know how imperative it is for Congress 
to take action to reauthorize and to 
modernize this almost three-decades- 
old law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1198 
March 16, 2022 
Again, we don’t want to talk about 
statistics because these are people— 
these are friends, these are mothers, 
daughters—but the statistics are just 
so in your face. 
Alaska Native women suffer the 
highest rate of forcible sexual assault 
and have reported rates of domestic vi-
olence up to 10 times higher than the 
national average. 
In so many of the Native villages in 
my State in rural Alaska, they have no 
law enforcement presence; so trying to 
prevent violence, trying to protect or 
ensure justice for survivors is hard. 
And so I really am very, very thank-
ful for the work that Senator SCHATZ 
committed to within the Senate Indian 
Affairs Committee to put together a 
strong Tribal title in VAWA that 
would continue to empower Tribal 
courts to help combat this major pub-
lic safety issue affecting Native people 
and children. 
We have got a pretty complex juris-
dictional landscape as the result of our 
Native Claims Settlement Act, and the 
last time that VAWA was reauthorized 
in 2013, Alaska was effectively left out. 
But today, we have an Alaska solution 
to this jurisdictional maze. We call it 
the Alaska Public Safety Empower-
ment pilot project that was included in 
the Tribal title, and it is the product of 
years of work with Tribal advocates, 
with the Department of Justice—some 
pretty smart lawyers out there—and 
then good, strong work in the com-
mittee. 
And what this pilot program will do 
is supplement the work that the State 
of Alaska is doing with regard to public 
safety. It doesn’t create Indian Coun-
try in the State, it doesn’t take away 
any jurisdiction, but it will empower a 
limited number of Alaska Tribes to ex-
ercise this special criminal jurisdiction 
over defendants who commit certain 
crimes that we outline in the law that 
occur in Native villages in the State. 
Tribes selected to participate are 
going to have to meet specific criteria 
that are set by the Department of Jus-
tice. They will have to include a Tribal 
justice system that can adequately 
safeguard the right of all defendants. 
So I am optimistic. I believe that our 
Alaska Tribes are up to this job. They 
are going to be good partners with the 
State, and they will make a difference. 
They will make a difference, and they 
will provide hope to so many in these 
communities that have felt without 
hope. 
We are celebrating, again, passage of 
this law—the reauthorization, the mod-
ernization. But for so many who have 
shown the bravery, the strength, the 
resilience in the wake of unspeakable 
trauma—we know that so many, again, 
of our friends have endured domestic 
violence, dating violence, sexual as-
sault, stalking. Many have survived, 
but so many have not. 
These women have endured physical, 
mental, emotional abuse. The impacts 
don’t necessarily fade away because 
the calendar moves on; but on their 
journeys 
to 
recovery 
and 
healing, 
many have developed an extraordinary 
inner strength to stand up and be advo-
cates for themselves and others, and 
they have spoken about their abuse, 
they have sought the changes to VAWA 
to prevent the future tragedies and 
hold perpetrators accountable, and we 
have heard them and their pleas to im-
prove access to essential support serv-
ices, whether healthcare, safe housing 
for victims—but we have also heard the 
cries of parents and loved ones who lost 
those that they love so very much. 
I am thinking of Butch and Cindy 
Moore right now. Butch and Cindy are 
from 
Wasilla. 
They 
have 
spent—I 
swear, they have spent every moment 
of their lives since they lost their beau-
tiful daughter Bree, 20 years old. They 
have been advocating for prevention ef-
forts to ensure that no parent experi-
ences the loss of their child to teen 
dating violence. 
Butch and Cindy have said: 
As parents who have experienced the dev-
astation of losing our daughter, Bree Moore, 
to dating violence, we know prevention is 
the key to keeping future generations safe 
from interpersonal violence. 
I know that Butch and Cindy are 
looking at this day and feeling that, 
again, there is some hope. There is 
some hope. 
This is a legislative win, but I think 
it is also a victory—a victory for 
women everywhere—and we mark its 
passage in memory of both those that 
we have lost and those that have sur-
vived. 
This is the day where we recognize 
that this Congress can act in a bipar-
tisan manner to address the crisis of 
violence in our communities by passing 
this reauthorization of the Violence 
Against Women Act, which is now law, 
now helping to protect women in Alas-
ka and across the country, and we 
thank all who helped us get here. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today also in recognition of the Vi-
olence Against Women Reauthorization 
Act of 2022. 
I 
am 
delighted 
President 
Biden 
signed it into law yesterday as part of 
the omnibus spending bill. 
It is important to know that this bill 
reauthorizes critical programs that 
help respond to domestic violence, dat-
ing violence, sexual assault, and stalk-
ing. It is long overdue, but today, this 
bill will become law. 
Last month, I introduced this reau-
thorization 
bill 
alongside 
Senators 
ERNST, DURBIN—both of whom are on 
the floor today—MURKOWSKI, who is 
also here today, and additional cospon-
sors. 
A number of advocates joined us, in-
cluding Angelina Jolie, to speak about 
the importance of the legislation. 
The bill we introduced and the bill 
we are passing today has really strong 
bipartisan support, including that of 11 
Republican cosponsors. 
In addition to reauthorizing the Vio-
lence Against Women Act through 2027, 
the law includes bringing it up to date, 
and that is important. It means that 
existing programs will be able to do an 
even better job protecting and sup-
porting survivors of domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault, and 
stalking. 
It is the result of a truly bipartisan 
effort, and I want to thank Senators 
ERNST, DURBIN—both are on the floor— 
particularly Senator MURKOWSKI, for 
working with me to prepare this impor-
tant piece of legislation. I am very ap-
preciative of the partnership because 
the law will become a reality. We also 
had help from a number of our Senate 
colleagues on both side of the aisle who 
made important contributions to the 
effort. 
This act plays a critical role sup-
porting law enforcement in their ef-
forts to stop these perpetrators before 
it is too late. It reauthorizes important 
programs and provides the necessary 
updates to strengthen them. 
So what does it do? 
First, it enhances and expands serv-
ices for survivors, including survivors 
in rural communities, LGBT survivors, 
survivors with disabilities, and sur-
vivors who experience abuse later in 
life. Older people get a lot of violence. 
It strengthens the criminal justice 
response to domestic violence, includ-
ing by improving the Justice Depart-
ment’s 
STOP 
grant 
program 
and 
strengthening the ability of Tribal 
courts to address instances of domestic 
violence on Tribal lands. 
It also establishes a pilot program 
that focuses on addressing domestic vi-
olence, dating violence, sexual assault, 
and 
stalking 
through 
community- 
based, victim-initiated efforts to seek 
accountability. 
And the law invests in prevention 
education efforts that will improve the 
healthcare system’s response to sexual 
violence—we hope. 
And these changes can have a real 
impact. Here is one example: The Inter-
national 
Association 
of 
Forensic 
Nurses reports that only one in four 
U.S. hospitals has a sexual assault fo-
rensic nurse on duty—not a special 
place but even one nurse on duty. Our 
bipartisan law remedies this problem 
by providing additional funding and 
training to increase access to forensic 
nurses, particularly in rural areas, 
where, strangely enough, a lot of this 
violence takes place. 
Through this bipartisan law, we will 
make significant improvements to our 
Nation’s response to domestic violence, 
but I want to caution everybody, it 
isn’t perfect. 
I really regret that certain provisions 
were unable to be included in this bill. 
In particular, I had hoped we could in-
clude a provision to close the boyfriend 
loophole. Most people don’t know that 
while individuals convicted of domestic 
violence against a spouse are prevented 
from purchasing a firearm, that is not 
the case for those convicted of domes-
tic violence against a dating partner.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1199 
March 16, 2022 
We tried to get that part passed, and it 
is very disappointing that there was 
not sufficient bipartisan support for 
this provision to close what will re-
main a dangerous loophole. 
So, clearly, we still have work to do. 
There are those of us who follow these 
assaults carefully and make a deter-
mination where this bill works and 
where it might need improvement, and 
I have just suggested one. So we will 
watch those figures carefully. 
I would like to thank the many advo-
cates who provided valuable input and 
support. This bill was written in close 
consultation with the people who are 
on the frontlines helping survivors of 
domestic violence every day. 
For nearly 30 years, the Violence 
Against Women Act has played a vital 
role in the Federal response to domes-
tic violence, dating violence, sexual as-
sault, and stalking. As Katie Ray- 
Jones, the CEO of the National Domes-
tic Violence Hotline, noted, the Vio-
lence Against Women Act provides 
services with ‘‘a variety of options to 
meet their evolving and complex needs 
for services and support.’’ For example, 
according to the National Network to 
End Domestic Violence, in a single day 
in 2020, there were 76,525 survivors, in 1 
day 75,000 women were affected by do-
mestic violence who received assist-
ance thanks to programs funded and 
supported by the Violence Against 
Women Act. 
So despite the progress made over 
the last three decades, sexual, emo-
tional, and physical abuse are still 
painful realities for far too many 
Americans. We need to say this over 
and over again. We need to change 
minds and change actions. 
More than one in three women and 
more than one in four men will experi-
ence rape, physical violence, or stalk-
ing by an intimate partner in their life-
time. According to the National Coali-
tion Against Domestic Violence in my 
home State of California, approxi-
mately 35 percent of California women 
and 31 percent of California men will 
experience 
violence 
from 
intimate 
partners in their lifetimes. That is an 
amazing figure, if you think about it. 
In conclusion, let me end with this: 
All too often, these instances of domes-
tic violence have fatal consequences. 
Every day, people are killed by a cur-
rent or former intimate partner. This 
law is long overdue. 
And I want to thank the Members 
who have spoken on the floor and all 
those who voted for this law. We are 
glad to get it signed into law and hope 
to put an end to some of this.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the nomination. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Fred W. Slaughter, of Cali-
fornia, to be United States District 
Judge for the Central District of Cali-
fornia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
BOLIVAR ACT 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
as the Federal Government rightfully 
continues to levy devastating sanc-
tions on Russia and punish Putin and 
his thugs for their horrific and unlaw-
ful invasion of Ukraine, we cannot, as 
the Biden administration has signaled 
it will, choose to empower one dictator 
so we can punish another. 
Nicoles Maduro is the illegitimate, 
ruthless dictator in Venezuela. I trav-
eled to the Colombia-Venezuela border 
and saw the suffering of the Ven-
ezuelan people at the hand of Maduro’s 
regime. I met with Venezuelan refugees 
and got updates from Colombian offi-
cials on just how bad Venezuelans were 
being treated by Maduro’s tyranny. 
Venezuelan children walk for hours 
through dense forests, across rivers, 
and over terrorist-controlled territory 
just to get to a school in Colombia for 
an education and a meal. Mothers with 
young children came to Cucuta to get 
the only meal they would eat for 3 
days. I met a pregnant woman who was 
forced to sleep on the streets of Ven-
ezuela 
because 
she 
was 
homeless. 
Think about that. I am a father and a 
grandfather. Imagine having to look at 
your 3-year-old child or grandchild in 
the eyes and tell them that they are 
not going to eat today because there is 
no food. 
The pain, the hunger, the devasta-
tion—I cannot believe any human 
being would do this to young children. 
It was heartbreaking, and it was evil. 
And there is one man responsible for it: 
Nicoles Maduro. 
Since my visit, things have only got-
ten worse. In what is one of the worst 
humanitarian crises in Latin American 
history, more than 6 million Ven-
ezuelans have fled Maduro’s oppression 
in Venezuela since 2014. 
In 2020, a factfinding mission for the 
United 
Nations 
determined 
that 
Maduro’s regime has engaged in crimes 
against humanity, including unlawful 
executions, 
enforced disappearances, 
arbitrary detentions, and torture. The 
regime has imprisoned hundreds of its 
political opponents and forced count-
less more into exile. They have used 
the guise of the COVID–19 pandemic to 
further crack down on journalists and 
dissenters. 
We know that what has been hap-
pening at the direction of Nicolas 
Maduro in Venezuela is horrific. That 
is why, in 2019, the previous adminis-
tration signed an Executive order 
issuing a complete economic embargo 
on Venezuela. 
We can all agree that the United 
States should not be bolstering such a 
disgusting socialist regime, and we 
cannot forget that any lifting of sanc-
tions or show of appeasement toward 
Maduro’s Venezuela will only further 
the suffering there and help its evil al-
lies, like Russia, Cuba, communist 
China, and Iran, which actively support 
Maduro’s abuses. So I and many others 
were deeply disturbed last week when 
we learned that President Biden se-
cretly sent a team to Venezuela—se-
cretly sent a team to Venezuela—and 
began negotiations on the potential 
purchase of Venezuelan oil and the eas-
ing of sanctions. 
High gas prices caused by President 
Biden’s war on American energy and 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine doesn’t 
mean we can turn a blind eye to 
Maduro’s genocide and oppression. We 
know that funds going to Maduro are 
used for terrorism in our hemisphere, 
and we know that Venezuela and Rus-
sia are aligned. If we support one, we 
support the other. That is why, just 
days after the American team left, the 
Russian Foreign Minister traveled to 
meet with the Venezuelan Vice Presi-
dent. 
Now, I am glad the administration fi-
nally made the decision to stop buying 
Russian oil—I think it came too late— 
but I am glad the Biden administration 
reluctantly agreed not to purchase oil 
from Venezuela. We shouldn’t be sup-
porting Maduro or Putin. It would be 
foolish if we made the mistake of sup-
porting one dictator so we could punish 
another dictator. Maduro has decided 
to be our enemy, and so is Putin. Nei-
ther of them deserves our money. 
The Biden administration needs to 
realize that our enemies are not the 
world’s only source of oil and natural 
gas. America has huge supplies of oil 
and natural gas, and we would have ac-
cess to those resources right now if the 
Biden administration hadn’t spent the 
past year relentlessly trying to destroy 
the U.S. oil industry. 
On day 1, Biden killed the Keystone 
Pipeline, and 10,000—10,000—jobs along-
side it were lost. Then he cut off new 
drilling contracts on public lands. The 
Biden EPA has added one ridiculous 
regulation after another to make it 
more expensive and harder for Amer-
ican oil manufacturers to do business. 
We went from being nearly energy 
independent and a net exporter in 2019 
to begging cartels and ruthless dic-
tators for oil. This is not American 
leadership, and it is not American inde-
pendence. 
It is long past time for the adminis-
tration to admit that its ridiculous 
Green New Deal policies put our secu-
rity at risk and hurt American fami-
lies. Prices at the pump are at an all-
time high across the Nation. 
We should be solving this problem 
with our own resources and with our 
own workers, not with Maduro and his 
thugs. That is why I have introduced 
the Banning Operations and Leases 
with the Illegitimate Venezuelan Au-
thoritarian Regime Act, or the BOLI-
VAR Act. This bill would prohibit Fed-
eral Agencies from doing business with 
the oppressive Maduro regime. We 
can’t stand by and let Maduro continue 
to commit genocide against his people, 
and we have to do everything possible 
to restrict the money Maduro uses to 
hold on to power and destabilize the re-
gion. 
When I was Governor of Florida, I 
signed a bill that prevented State agen-
cies from investing in companies doing 
business with the Government of Ven-
ezuela. 
In 2019, my amendment to cut off 
funds to the Maduro regime was in-
cluded in the National Defense Author-
ization Act. 
In March of last year, my colleagues 
on the Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs Committee agreed with 
me, and we unanimously passed the 
BOLIVAR Act through our committee. 
I am thankful for Senators JACKY 
ROSEN, MARCO RUBIO, and THOM TILLIS, 
who have cosponsored this legislation 
and helped bring this legislation this 
far. I also want to thank Congressman 
MICHAEL
WALTZ
for introducing the 
companion bipartisan bill in the House 
of Representatives. 
But we didn’t introduce the bill only 
to have the Biden administration begin 
working with Maduro’s thugs and bol-
stering the corrupt Venezuelan oil in-
dustry. We are trying to stop that, and 
no one should want to be on the side of 
Maduro’s genocide. 
I am grateful for the bipartisan sup-
port this bill has received, and I hope 
that the entire Senate will take a 
stand to support the fight for freedom 
and the people of Venezuela. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATION 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak on behalf of a few Federal 
judge nominees from the State of Cali-
fornia. 
In recognizing that, right now, many 
Americans are certainly following the 
news and the potential news of the 
Federal judiciary and are focusing on a 
nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. 
As a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I certainly look forward to 
hearing 
more 
from 
Judge 
Ketanji 
Brown Jackson next week as we con-
duct her confirmation hearing. 
The choices for the Supreme Court 
are certainly critical for the future of 
our democracy, but the fact of the mat-
ter is—and the Presiding Officer knows 
I like numbers and knows I like data. 
So the important data point here is 
that it is only a tiny percentage of 
cases in our Federal court system that 
actually reach the U.S. Supreme Court. 
In fact, more than 90 percent of the 
Federal cases are decided at the dis-
trict court level. That means the vast 
majority of people who interface with 
the Federal judiciary will only ever 
meet a district court judge, sitting on 
the other side of the bench, whether

they are witnesses to a crime, whether 
they are parties to a lawsuit or defend-
ants in a criminal case. 
That is one of the primary reasons I 
have worked so closely with the Biden 
administration in helping to identify 
and recommend and support talented 
nominees 
for 
California’s 
district 
courts. 
Today, I rise to highlight three nomi-
nees to serve as Federal judges whose 
confirmation processes we are begin-
ning today. 
NOMINATION OF RUTH BERMUDEZ MONTENEGRO 
Mr. President, Judge Ruth Monte-
negro is nominated to serve on the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern Dis-
trict of California. 
She is a proud daughter of Mexican 
immigrants who came to this country 
with 
only 
elementary 
school 
edu-
cations—just like my parents. Judge 
Montenegro understood early on—be-
cause of her parents’ experience and 
their journey—the value of getting a 
good education and of public service, 
starting at a very young age. She was 
born and raised in the Imperial Valley, 
where she returned after graduating 
from UCLA Law School. 
Like so many of us, you are trying to 
fulfill your parents’ dreams, so you go 
on to college and get a good education. 
You graduate and have options all over 
and choose to come home to make a 
difference. 
Judge Montenegro built a career in 
representing public agencies. She could 
have made a lot of money in the pri-
vate sector. She chose to represent 
public agencies, ranging from the Im-
perial Valley Housing Authority to the 
El Centro Elementary School District. 
She has served for nearly 10 years now 
as a State superior court and Federal 
magistrate judge. 
Judge Montenegro’s extensive judi-
cial experience and lifelong dedication 
to her community, I have no doubt, 
will strengthen the Southern District’s 
bench. 
NOMINATION OF FRED W. SLAUGHTER 
Mr. President, next, I would like to 
highlight Judge Fred Slaughter, who is 
nominated to serve on the U.S. District 
Court for the Central District of Cali-
fornia. 
Judge Slaughter received his under-
graduate and his law degree from 
UCLA, going on to a distinguished ca-
reer as a prosecutor. For more than a 
decade, he served as an assistant U.S. 
attorney in Arizona, Oregon, and Cali-
fornia, where he oversaw and tried hun-
dreds of cases, including cases involv-
ing human trafficking, bank robberies, 
and the prosecuting of members of 
White supremacist groups. 
Judge Slaughter has spent the past 8 
years serving in the Orange County Su-
perior Court. There, he is known for his 
compassion and leadership in juvenile 
justice. Judge Slaughter’s long career 
demonstrates his legal excellence as 
well as his commitment to providing 
justice for all. 
NOMINATION OF JACQUELINE SCOTT CORLEY 
Mr. President, finally, Judge Jac-
queline Corley is nominated to serve 
for the Northern District of California. 
She is a native of Long Beach. She 
earned her bachelor’s degree from UC 
Berkeley and her J.D. from Harvard 
Law School. 
Judge Corley’s nontraditional path 
to the bench displays her commitment 
to public service. After spending some 
time in private practice, she spent 
more than 10 years as a career law 
clerk for the Northern District of Cali-
fornia. Based on her outstanding work 
in that role and the expertise that she 
built in private practice prior, Judge 
Corley was selected to serve as a mag-
istrate judge for the Northern District. 
She has served there for the past dec-
ade and is known for her mentorship of 
current law clerks. 
I celebrate each of these highly 
qualified nominees who will help Cali-
fornians access justice throughout our 
State. When people enter a Federal 
court, they should feel confident in the 
promise of equal justice—equal justice 
that I know these three nominees will 
help deliver. The oversight and judg-
ment of a thoughtful and fair judge is 
paramount. 
Our 
democracy 
depends 
on 
the 
public’s faith in the judiciary. That is 
why I am committed to building a 
bench of judges who will better reflect 
and 
understand 
the 
districts, 
the 
States, and the country that they 
serve. I am proud to take another step 
toward that goal by supporting the 
confirmations of these three judges, 
and I urge all of our colleagues to do 
the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF GEORGIA 
SHOOTINGS 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I rise 
today to reflect on a dark day in Geor-
gia’s recent history. 
One year ago today, a hateful act of 
violence shook Metropolitan Atlanta 
and reverberated across our State, our 
country, and indeed the world. In the 
span of just a few hours, our sense of 
safety and sanctuary was pierced by 
bullets of hate and fear. Eight precious 
people lost their lives—eight people 
who were loved by their families, their 
friends, their children; eight people 
with their own successes and struggles, 
hopes, and dreams. 
We speak their names: Soon Chung 
Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, 
Yong Ae Yue, Delaina Ashley Yaun 
Gonzalez, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie 
Tan, Daoyou Feng. 
My heart aches for these Georgians 
and their families for whom I am sure 
the wounds are still fresh. They were 
the victims of unconscionable, sense-
less hate. 
As a pastor, I believe in the sacred 
worth of every human being—that we 
are a strange admixture of dust and di-
vinity, of sod and sky, of beauty and 
possibility. 
So I will ask now for all of my col-
leagues and everyone who can to join 
me in taking a moment of silence to 
remember these eight Georgians and to 
pray, each in our own way, for their 
families. 
(Moment of silence.) 
Thank you. 
VIOLENCE AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS 
Mr. President, importantly, I must 
mention that this unspeakable vio-
lence was visited largely upon Geor-
gia’s Asian-American community and 
especially on women of Asian descent. 
Unfortunately, this hateful act that 
horrified Atlanta is not isolated; it is 
part of a larger trend. 
Last year, anti-Asian hate crimes in-
creased 339 percent. Think about that— 
in 1 year, a 339-percent increase in 
anti-Asian hate crimes. It is a sobering 
statistic, and it should remind all of us 
of our shared duty in our democracy to 
stay committed to peace, an active 
peace, that recognizes that we are in 
this together. 
It was Martin Niemoller, the pastor 
during Hitler’s Third Reich, who said: 
First they came for the Communists, and I 
did not speak . . . because I was not a Com-
munist. 
Then they came for the Socialists, and I 
did not speak . . . because I was not a Social-
ist. 
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, 
and I did not speak . . . because I was not a 
Trade Unionist. 
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not 
speak . . . because I was not a Jew. 
Then they came for me, and there was no 
one left to speak. . . . 
So this is a tragedy, in a real sense, 
visited upon all of us. 
As a student of history and a voice 
for our State and the Senate, I know 
Georgians understand all too well how 
hate and misplaced anger can hurt our 
communities and how certain parts of 
our 
community 
are 
so 
easily 
scapegoated and lose their sense of 
sanctuary. And then when that hap-
pens, all of us lose a piece of ourselves. 
So I want to say to my AAPI sisters, 
brothers, and neighbors that I see you, 
and, more importantly, I will continue 
to stand with you against hate and vio-
lence wherever it rears its ugly head. 
That is why I cosponsored and fought 
to pass the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act 
and to get it signed into law, directing 
more resources to ensure our commu-
nities have what they need to seek jus-
tice whenever and wherever hate and 
crime rear their ugly heads. 
I am especially proud that my col-
leagues worked with me to include a 
provision in this legislation that names 
and acknowledges the pain and experi-
ences of Georgia’s AAPI community 
specifically and makes sure we never 
forget the names attached to the lives 
and the families we lost in the horrific 
shootings in Atlanta 1 year ago today. 
And that is why I am pushing here in 
the Senate to confirm a U.S. attorney 
for the northern district of our State, a 
post that is integral to helping Geor-
gians stop crime and pursue justice.

to remind us all that we all have a 
stake in each other’s well-being. 
Georgia’s greatest son, that great 
American, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
said it best: We are tied in a single gar-
ment of destiny, caught up in ‘‘an ines-
capable network of mutuality.’’ ‘‘What-
ever affects one directly, affects all in-
directly.’’ ‘‘I cannot be all that I ought 
to be until you are all that you ought 
to be, and you cannot be all that you 
ought to be until I am all that I ought 
to be.’’ 
And so let us continue working to-
gether to stop Asian hate, to stop the 
scapegoating, and to create what Dr. 
King called the beloved community—a 
community where everybody, no mat-
ter their skin color, ethnicity, sexual 
orientation, or religious background, 
can live a life of fulfillment and joy 
without fear of facing hate. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Oklahoma. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
there are a lot of things going on in the 
world right now—a lot. What is hap-
pening in Ukraine; Russian aggression; 
continuing talk about the continual 
challenges of communist China; deal-
ing with COVID–19 and its effects still 
worldwide, still here in the United 
States; still lots of people very frus-
trated on transportation mandates—on 
the masks, I should say; other vaccine 
mandates that are still out there; we 
have a 7—almost 8—percent now infla-
tion rate that is in the country; cost of 
living is going up; all the energy 
issues—there are so many things that 
we are dealing with around this body of 
late. 
I want to bring something to the 
middle of this conversation that I don’t 
want us to forget about because the 
media seemed to have pushed it all to 
the back burner. And I have even had 
people recently catch me and say, Ap-
parently, things are going much better 
on our southern border because I don’t 
hear about it anymore. Well, it has not 
gotten better. And I want to bring a 
couple of issues and one in particular 
that I am very concerned about of 
where things are going right now, on 
our enforcement on the southern bor-
der. 
This chart walks through the last 10 
years of illegal crossings that had been 
actually 
apprehended, 
engaged—the 
new term is ‘‘encountered’’ that the 
Biden administration is using. This is 
over the last 10 years, and this is quar-
ter by quarter of what has actually oc-
curred. 
You will see the rise and fall over 
multiple times. You will see spikes 
that have happened. But right there, 
that spot, is when President Biden was 
elected. That is that date. His election 
is there, and this is what has occurred 
since that time period. 
Instead of seeing a big dropoff just in 
the last couple of months, we have only 
seen it go down, but not even close to 
the highest peaks in the past. 
To give you a point of reference on 
that, since January of 2021, we have 
had 2,355,000 people whom we have ‘‘en-
countered’’ on the southwest border— 
folks who have illegally crossed our 
border. These are not just record num-
bers; these are alltime high numbers— 
nothing even close to the number of 
people who are illegally crossing the 
border. 
Now, this is on the southern border. 
And there are two facts I want to be 
able to add to this, the first of which is 
what is happening inside the country: 
That would be ICE removals. 
This is since 2015, the ICE removals 
that have been done every year during 
the Obama administration, during the 
Trump administration, and then during 
the first year of the Biden administra-
tion. So not only do we have 2.3 million 
people who have illegally come to our 
border and crossed it that we have en-
countered, but it is an alltime low of 
actual deportations that are happening 
right now as well. 
So not only on our southern border 
are we seeing record numbers of high 
coming in inside the country, it is 
record-low numbers actually being de-
ported out. 
This is by design. This is not acci-
dental. The policies that have been put 
in place on our southern border were 
put in place to encourage people, quite 
frankly, to be able to cross the border, 
knowing full well that when you get in-
side, you won’t actually be deported. 
There is only one policy that is set 
out there that has been in the middle 
of this that has changed the dynamic 
at all, and it is a policy most Ameri-
cans never even heard of. It is called 
title 42 expulsions. Quite frankly, prob-
ably most of the folks in this room 
have never heard of title 42 expulsions. 
It is a new term, so I want to be able 
to walk through it a little bit. 
Starting in March of 2020—just 2 
years ago—when COVID started to ac-
celerate worldwide, the Surgeon Gen-
eral made a recommendation through 
the CDC, through HHS, to the Presi-
dent to be able to say we have a world-
wide pandemic that is occurring. Here 
is title 42 of the Public Health Service 
Act. It says: 
Whenever the Surgeon General determines 
that by reason of the existence of any com-
municable disease in a foreign country, there 
is serious danger of the introduction of such 
disease into the United States, and that . . . 
danger is so increased by the introduction of 
persons or property from [that] country that 
a suspension of the right to introduce such 
persons and property is required in the inter-
est of the public health, the Surgeon Gen-
eral, in accordance with regulations ap-
proved by the President, shall have the 
power to prohibit . . . the introduction of 
persons and property from such countries or 
places [that they] shall designate . . . to 
[avoid] such danger. 
In March of 2020, the Trump adminis-
tration said: We have got a concern 
dealing with individuals crossing our 
border illegally. They are coming from 
all over the world. There is COVID all 
over the world. There are some au-
thorities that you go through that you 
can actually say some of these folks 
can be turned around immediately. 
The Surgeon General, HHS, and the 
President agreed that we are going to 
turn people around at the border imme-
diately. So the Trump administration 
did that. 
And, by the way, right there is Presi-
dent Biden’s inauguration. His HHS 
also agreed with this same policy of 
title 42 to say: We have a serious risk 
from COVID, so we should also turn 
people around in numbers at the border 
and send them back home. 
This is the number under the Biden 
administration of individuals who have 
been turned around. 
Let me give you a perspective. Of the 
2.3 million people who have been en-
countered at our border since the be-
ginning of the Biden administration, 56 
percent of those folks have been lit-
erally turned around at the border and 
told, You cannot enter under title 42 
authority—56 percent of the people. So 
44 percent of the people have been al-
lowed to be able to come into our coun-
try. 
Let me set this in context because I 
am throwing a lot of numbers out at 
everybody. I want you to remember all 
the news reports from last year, all of 
the overcrowding in the Donna, TX, fa-
cility that we saw, all of the people 
crammed underneath the bridge in the 
Rio Grande Valley, all of those folks 
who piled across the border in massive 
numbers that we saw coming into the 
United States—that represented only 
44 percent of the people illegally cross-
ing our border because they were al-
lowed in. 
I bring this up because as of right 
now, we have heard that DHS, the 
President, and HHS are considering 
canceling title 42. If that occurs, we 
won’t have 1 million people illegally 
crossing our border and released into 
the United States; within months, we 
will have 2 million. And all that you 
saw last summer of the flood of peo-
ple—that 44 percent—imagine what 
that looks like more than doubled this 
summer. 
The conversation is we are getting 
toward the backside of COVID. Iron-
ically enough, while the President just 
extended the transportation require-
ment 
for 
masks—again—while 
the 
President just asked for billions of dol-
lars of additional money because we 
need vaccines worldwide to be able to 
distribute more vaccines worldwide to 
be able to fight COVID, while we are 
still dealing with all the additional 
surge rise and falls in other countries— 
in fact, just within the last couple of 
days, 
China 
has 
gone 
back 
into 
lockdown based on new COVID cases in 
China—while all of that is occurring 
worldwide, apparently, the President is 
looking to cancel title 42. 
And when I have asked what will re-
place that policy, the answer has come 
back to me: We are not sure yet. That 
tells me nothing is actually the plan to 
replace this. That is a problem.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1203 
March 16, 2022 
What happens when title 42 goes 
away? An extra million people come 
into the country illegally, remem-
bering that when all of those folks 
come into the country, apparently, the 
Biden administration also has no plan 
to deport them. 
Where are we right now with the 
number of people that have illegally 
crossed our border, and where are they 
from? Let me give you a quick map. 
This is a map of all the countries in 
the past year—just in the past year— 
who have illegally crossed our border. 
In the white there is the United States. 
In the red are the countries that we 
have seen people illegally cross our 
border. If you want to squint at that 
map, let me just give you shorthand for 
it. It is every country in the world. 
Last year, we had individuals from 
literally every country in the world il-
legally cross our southern border. Yes, 
that includes China; that includes 
North Korea; that includes Iran. It in-
cludes them all. 
Interestingly enough, just in the 
last—well, not the last 3 months but 
the last 4 months that we have had 
records on it—that would be October, 
November, December, and January— 
just in those last 4 months that we 
have those records, we have 6,400 Rus-
sian citizens who illegally crossed our 
southern border. Just in the last 4 
months we have records, there were 
6,400 Russian citizens. 
We have people from all over the 
world who are illegally crossing our 
southern border because people know, 
if you get across the border, you are in. 
When title 42 goes away, this acceler-
ates even more. It is an open invitation 
because 56 percent of the people were 
turned around, 44 percent of the people 
were released into the country—by the 
way, that is over a million so far—that 
goes away. Then they all get in. 
What happens at that point? Those 
individuals are told that they can 
make a request for asylum, even 
though our statistics show 91 percent 
of the people who request asylum are 
actually coming for economic reasons, 
not actually true asylum—91 percent. 
Those individuals are released into 
the country. They are told to be able to 
sign up for a hearing date, and they 
can do their hearing anywhere they 
want in the United States. They are 
given a hearing date, currently, 6 years 
in the future—6 years. So they will be 
traveling in our country anywhere 
they want to go for the next 6 years 
waiting on their hearing. 
By the way, if they don’t show up for 
their hearing, apparently there is no 
plan to be able to actually go get them, 
if they don’t show up for their hearing, 
because, right now, ICE is not remov-
ing people. So they are just released, 
and when they are released into the 
country, they can immediately text 
friends back home and say: I am in. 
Here is what I said. Here is where I 
crossed. Here is the cartel member 
whom I paid on the southern border to 
be able to get me through. I am in. Fol-
low my same path; you will have the 
same result. 
What can be done about this? Well, 
let me just highlight a couple of 
things, and then I want to talk about 
this more. 
First things first—don’t end title 42. 
We still have a worldwide pandemic. 
Until there is a plan of what is actually 
going to occur next on our southern 
border, don’t end title 42. 
This is the time for the President and 
Ali Mayorkas and all the leadership to 
put up a pause and to say: The chaos 
that happened last year was only 44 
percent of the people crossing our 
southern border. We do not have, phys-
ically, the capability to be able to han-
dle that many people. Do not cancel 
title 42. 
The second thing is the ‘‘Remain in 
Mexico’’ policy. The ‘‘Remain in Mex-
ico’’ policy that actually started under 
President Trump, President Biden set 
aside, and Federal courts stepped back 
in and told this administration: You 
have to put back in place the ‘‘Remain 
in Mexico’’ policy. So they chose to do 
it. 
I have talked to this body before 
about what they did. The Biden admin-
istration said: OK. We will follow the 
court order. We will reinstate the ‘‘Re-
main in Mexico’’ policy. 
They have reinstated that policy the 
last 3 months. They have put up three 
different facilities. Actually, now there 
are four total facilities. I visited one of 
them in Brownsville, TX. That facility 
has six courtrooms. Each courtroom is 
set up to handle 22 people at a time, 
plus their attorneys, plus all the ancil-
lary services. Six of those they have 
got set up. They have individual meet-
ing spaces set up for 120 people to meet 
individually with their attorney. So 120 
rooms, 6 courtrooms that are all set 
up, and all the ancillary everything 
around it as well, and we have now got 
4 different locations for that. 
Of the half a million people who have 
illegally crossed our border in the time 
that they have set up the new MPP 
courtrooms—of the half a million peo-
ple who have crossed illegally during 
that time period, so far, the Biden ad-
ministration has pulled out 1,569 of 
them to evaluate if they would go into 
the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy. Of 
those, 893 they actually put in the sys-
tem. Of those, they have actually had 
494 of those who at some point came 
back and said: We have changed our 
mind. We talked to attorneys. We have 
a new way to be able to get out of it. 
We are trying to get the actual num-
ber of people who have actually gone 
through the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ pol-
icy and who have actually qualified for 
it, while we have 4 different locations, 
each of them with 6 courtrooms, 120 
meeting spaces. But what we are find-
ing is, really, a handful of people actu-
ally have ‘‘qualified’’ for the ‘‘Remain 
in Mexico’’ policy out of half a million 
people during that time period. 
The simple answer is that the Biden 
administration is spending millions 
and millions of taxpayer dollars setting 
up the MPP Program that the court 
has required them to do, but they have 
made so many exceptions to it, no one 
actually qualifies. So they are trying 
to please the court by saying ‘‘We are 
following your order,’’ waste American 
tax dollars, while we continue to see 
record numbers of people crossing the 
border. That is a waste. 
If we are going to stop this, keep 
title 42 in place until you have a re-
sponse to what you are going to do in-
stead. Actually run the MPP Program 
as the court has instructed you to do 
rather than playing games with Amer-
ican tax dollars and with the system 
here. 
I would also encourage you to put the 
‘‘Safe Third Country’’ policy back in 
place. The previous administration had 
actually created a relationship with 
multiple other countries so that as in-
dividuals traveled through other coun-
tries to get to the United States, they 
could make asylum requests in those 
locations, because we understand—be-
cause we know the law in this body— 
the law is very clear on the inter-
national standards on this. 
If you are going to request asylum, 
you go to the next safe country, and 
you request asylum. If they are trav-
eling through five countries or they are 
traveling literally across the globe to 
get to the United States from every-
where else so they can request asylum, 
that is not asylum; that is economic 
opportunity. 
By the way, don’t blame them for 
coming to the greatest country in the 
world to get economic opportunity—ex-
cept that is not asylum, and we all 
know it. So why don’t we actually 
treat it exactly as we all see it? 
If you would like to come to the 
greatest country in the world, wonder-
ful. Go through the legal process of 
that. We allow a million people a year 
to legally become citizens of the 
United States, going through the legal 
process. Do that. But for the billions of 
people who wake up every day wishing 
they were in the United States, I don’t 
blame you. But we welcome people 
when they come through legally in this 
process, and we do with open arms wel-
come people who come through legally. 
There are ways to be able to address 
this, but my first concern today is to 
be able to speak to this administration 
and to be able to say: The title 42 piece 
is essential to maintain. Do not let go 
of this until you have a solution to 
what is happening at the border, or the 
chaos at the border will be even worse 
this summer than it was last summer, 
and it is on you for not enforcing the 
border. 
I want to keep this conversation 
going in the days ahead, but as of now, 
I yield the floor.

ator from Iowa.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1204 
March 16, 2022 
Week, a very important week in our 
system of self-government. For the last 
17 years, advocacy groups, good-gov-
ernment watchdogs, media organiza-
tions, and many Members of this body 
have joined forces to observe the im-
portance of transparency in govern-
ment and freedom of information. As a 
longtime champion for open, accessible 
government, I speak today in support 
of what we all ought to consider endur-
ing principles. 
Sunshine Week coincides each year 
with March 16. That is the day one of 
our Nation’s Founding Fathers and 
fourth President of the United States 
James Madison was born. Madison is 
widely known as the father of the Con-
stitution and the Bill of Rights. From 
his writings, particularly in the Fed-
eralist Papers, you might say he was 
the architect who framed our system of 
checks and balances. Madison believed 
all powers of the government are de-
rived of, by, and for the people, and 
that is what brings me to the floor 
today. 
The public has a right to know what 
their government is doing and how it is 
spending tax dollars. There are very 
few things in government that should 
be kept secret: national security, so we 
don’t tell our enemies what we are 
going to do; the privacy of American 
citizens; and some intelligence-gath-
ering information. I will bet that is 1 
percent of everything the government 
is involved in. Yet there are some peo-
ple who think that a lot more ought to 
be classified or secret, et cetera, et 
cetera. 
So we have the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act that is to protect the public’s 
right to know. Through Freedom of In-
formation 
Act 
requests, 
everyday 
Americans can ask a Federal Agency 
for information. Unfortunately, now— 
and it is a growing problem—Federal 
Agencies seem to have the unstated 
goal of releasing as little information 
as possible to the public. 
Agencies 
rely 
on 
exemptions 
to 
FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act, 
to withhold information. A 2021 Gov-
ernment Accountability Office study 
found this: that Federal Agencies use 
FOIA exemptions to avoid disclosing 
documents. That problem has doubled 
between 2012 and 2019. 
Most Americans may not be familiar 
with the section of the code that we 
call the (b)(3) FOIA exemption, and, of 
course, they don’t have to be aware of 
this, but they should know that it is 
the most used justification by the Fed-
eral Government to withhold informa-
tion from the public. 
The increase in the use of this FOIA 
exemption to withhold information 
from the public is unacceptable to me, 
and it ought to be unacceptable to any-
body who believes that we should not 
have secrecy in government. 
In another recent report, the Govern-
ment Accountability Office found that 
FOIA request backlogs increased by 
nearly 20 percent in just the 1 year of 
2019 to 2020. In fact, backlogged FOIA 
requests are up 97 percent since 2012. 
Sixteen Federal Agencies had more 
than 1,000 backlogged FOIA requests. 
They account for 94 percent of back-
logged requests across the entire gov-
ernment. 
Federal Agencies ought to do bet-
ter—must do better—and we must all 
work to ensure that they are respond-
ing appropriately and within a reason-
able time for FOIA requests. 
Congressional oversight is part of our 
constitutional assignment: to protect 
the power of the purse and ensure laws 
are faithfully enforced. 
Finally, we must acknowledge the 
important role that citizens play who 
bravely come forward, often at great 
professional risk, to report wrongdoing 
in our efforts to prevent waste, fraud, 
and abuse. I have often said that whis-
tleblowers are the best line of defense 
against government waste. No one 
shines a brighter light on waste, fraud, 
and abuse than whistleblowers. And 
why might that be? Because they are 
down in the bowels of the government 
where maybe the heads of the Agencies 
don’t know something wrong is going 
on, and they are able to point it out— 
the whistleblowers are. 
That is why I introduced legislation 
this Congress to strengthen the False 
Claims Act. I got the False Claims Act 
passed in 1986. Since then, that act has 
helped government recover $70 billion 
in fraud. 
Last year, I asked the Department of 
Veterans Affairs about allegations that 
VA employees leaked potentially mar-
ket-sensitive information, and then do 
you know what they did? They retali-
ated 
against 
these 
whistleblowers. 
Nearly 1 year later, I haven’t received 
any answers, and I assume I am not 
going to receive any answers because it 
is an embarrassment to the VA. 
As a cofounder and cochairman of the 
Whistleblower Protection Caucus, I 
lead 
efforts 
from 
Capitol 
Hill 
to 
strengthen 
protections 
and 
raise 
awareness for what often is an uphill 
battle for whistleblowers. 
I want you to know how I feel whis-
tleblowers are treated by their very 
own government, how they are treated 
just because they want the government 
to do what the government is supposed 
to be doing under the laws, and they 
want the money spent the way Con-
gress intends for the money to be 
spent. These whistleblowers who point 
out that wrongdoing are treated by the 
bureaucracy like skunks at a picnic. 
This U.S. Senator will continue shin-
ing spotlight on waste, fraud, and 
abuse at the Pentagon, and I am going 
to do it elsewhere, as well. I will con-
tinue advocating for whistleblowers 
with every tool at my disposal. 
And as an Iowa farmer, I know why 
farmers make hay when the sun shines, 
and that is a good lesson for good gov-
ernment. Sunshine helps hold govern-
ment accountable to the people. 
Let me repeat that again: Trans-
parency brings accountability. 
EB–5 REFORM AND INTEGRITY ACT OF 2022 
Madam President, I have another 
point I would like to make. We were 
able to pass something with the Omni-
bus appropriations bill that I have been 
working on in a bipartisan way for 
years. It was a program that was 
abused, and we finally got together— 
Senator LEAHY and I—to finally win 
what we have been trying to do for 
years. 
So I am here to speak about reforms 
to the EB–5 investor visa program that 
were included in last week’s Omnibus 
bill. I also addressed this issue before 
the vote, but I would like to follow up 
on that statement with some brief re-
marks about how important this is 
after years of fighting to get it done. 
First, this wouldn’t have been done 
without working with my friend and 
colleague Senator LEAHY. So I thank 
him. He worked with me for several 
years on reforming this EB–5 program. 
Senator LEAHY, as well as his staff, 
have put in a great deal of time and 
work on a number of legislative efforts 
to reform the EB–5 program. I appre-
ciate the partnership that we had on 
this issue for those many years. 
As I mentioned in my previous state-
ment on the day the bill passed, Con-
gress originally authorized the EB–5 
Regional Center Program in 1992 as a 
pilot program and as an outgrowth of 
the EB–5 investor visa that was created 
by Congress 2 years before that, in 1990. 
When the EB–5 visa and regional cen-
ter programs were established, Con-
gress intended for them to spur invest-
ment in, No. 1, rural areas, and, No. 2, 
in economically depressed areas. I em-
phasize rural and economically de-
pressed areas because this whole pro-
gram, over a period of the next 20 
years, evolved into a program far re-
moved from the original goals. Senator 
LEAHY and I recognized that 5 or 6 
years ago. But to get around all of the 
interest groups that have something to 
do with the EB–5 program, and particu-
larly those who are enriching them-
selves from it, it is hard to get changes 
made here in the Congress of the 
United States. 
Thank God we were fortunate not to 
get the EB–5 program extended from 
year to year because that is what hap-
pened for 4 or 5 years as we were work-
ing on these reforms. You just ex-
tended it and let the fraud and abuse of 
the law go on. But, finally, about a 
year ago, we kept that program from 
being extended year to year and forced 
people to sit down and talk to us in a 
responsible way to get to where we are 
today. 
It is unfortunate that the EB–5 Re-
gional Center Program, in particular, 
has been plagued with all this fraud 
and abuse. Rampant and abusive gerry-
mandering of the EB–5 program’s tar-
geted employment areas also under-
mined congressional intent that lower 
investment thresholds be a tool for 
channeling investment into areas that 
truly need it. Those are the rural areas 
and the economically depressed areas

March 16, 2022 
of our country. Gerrymandering under-
mined the whole purpose of the pro-
gram. 
Another problem that the reforms 
addressed was that EB–5 investment 
levels had not been adjusted by Con-
gress since 1990, and they should have 
been adjusted for the inflation that has 
taken place since then, and our act 
does make some adjustment in that 
area. It doesn’t quite make up for all 
the inflation we have had since 1990, 
but it is still better than if we had gone 
with those 1990 figures. 
The EB–5 Reform and Integrity Act 
of 2022, which was included in the Om-
nibus bill, will address a number of 
these issues. The bill, which Senator 
LEAHY and I primarily authored, for-
mally repeals the pilot program cre-
ated by Congress in 1992 and codifies in 
its place a new Regional Center Pro-
gram reflecting a number of reforms 
that we pursued for many years. These 
reforms will help to crack down on 
fraud and abuse that have plagued the 
program for far too many years. 
As I said in my previous statement, 
all EB–5 regional centers that had op-
erated under the lapsed and repealed 
pilot program will be expected to seek 
a new regional center designation. In 
that process, they will have to certify 
compliance with all the relevant re-
quirements and reforms laid out in our 
bill, now law, in order to receive such 
a designation. 
Additionally, for the first time since 
1990, the bill statutorily raises EB–5 in-
vestment levels and mandates that 
they be adjusted for inflation every 5 
years so we don’t have what has hap-
pened in the last 30 years using 1990 fig-
ures for investment. 
The legislation also codifies certain 
aspects of the 2019 EB–5 Immigrant In-
vestor Program modernization rule. 
Specifically, the bill codifies the 2019 
rule’s definition of a ‘‘high unemploy-
ment’’ targeted employment area and 
allows only the Department of Home-
land Security to make such a designa-
tion. 
The so-called ‘‘doughnut’’ targeted 
employment area model from the 2019 
rule will significantly limit the num-
ber of census tracts that may be used 
to seek designation as a high unem-
ployment area. 
This 
targeted 
employment 
area 
model, combined with exclusive au-
thority of the Department of Homeland 
Security to make ‘‘high unemploy-
ment’’ targeted employment area des-
ignations, should then crack down on 
the targeted employment area gerry-
mandering, which gerrymandering has 
long deprived the rural and the eco-
nomically distressed areas of the in-
vestment that Congress intended when 
Congress passed that legislation—now, 
I guess, 30 years ago. 
Listen to this next point. I want the 
Department of Homeland Security to 
pay attention to this. It is also my be-
lief and expectation that the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security should re-
serve ‘‘high unemployment’’ targeted 
employment area designations for cen-
sus tracts that have experienced per-
sistently high unemployment for a 
number of years rather than just brief 
spikes in unemployment due to tem-
porary 
and 
extraordinary 
cir-
cumstances, such as what you could 
have because of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, as just one example. 
Finally, the legislation puts in place 
specific visa set-asides for rural area 
projects, 
high 
unemployment 
area 
projects, and infrastructure projects. 
The visa set-aside for infrastructure 
projects is limited to true public infra-
structure projects; that is, in further 
explanation, those that benefit the 
public and the American people, not 
public-private partnerships or projects 
for private businesses. 
I will continue to monitor the imple-
mentation of this bill, as well as devel-
opments in the EB–5 program over 
coming months and years. 
This bill was titled the EB–5 Reform 
and Integrity Act of 2022. It is the re-
sult of years of hard work, and I hope 
it brings real reform to a program 
badly in need of that reform. I am 
grateful that it was included in the 
Omnibus bill and was happy, after all 
of these years, to see meaningful re-
form of the EB–5 program finally 
signed into law. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, on 
Thursday, the February inflation num-
bers were released, and the news wasn’t 
pretty. Inflation for February was 7.9 
percent, the highest inflation since 
January of 1982—January of 1982, 40 
years ago. We are in the grip of the 
worst inflation in 40 years. 
American families have been hit hard 
by this crisis as the price of everyday 
necessities has soared, and energy 
prices, particularly gas prices, are one 
of the top challenges facing Americans. 
Energy prices are up 25 percent on av-
erage from a year ago. Electricity is up 
9 percent. Propane, kerosene, and fire 
wood are up 19 percent. Utility gas 
services are up 23 percent, and prices at 
the pump for gasoline are up 38 per-
cent. 
The national average for a gallon of 
gas was $4.31 on Tuesday, up from $2.86 
a year ago. That is $1.45 more per gal-
lon. That is a big problem for American 
families. That is a big problem for our 
entire economy. 
High energy prices don’t just have an 
impact when Americans fill up their 
cars; they affect prices across the econ-
omy. High energy prices drive up the 
cost of operating a factory. They drive 
up the cost of raw materials, and they 
drive up the cost of getting goods to 
customers. 
President Biden would like to blame 
the inflation situation, particularly 
high energy prices, on Vladimir Putin. 
I don’t need to tell anyone how ludi-
crous that is. Our inflation crisis has 
been going on for a year. Vladimir 
Putin invaded Ukraine 3 weeks ago. I 
am afraid passing the buck to Putin 
doesn’t hold water. 
Now, it is true that the uncertainty 
surrounding 
Putin’s 
war 
and 
cor-
responding sanctions on Russia are 
partly to blame for the most recent 
spike in gas prices. But had gas prices 
been lower to start with, Americans 
wouldn’t be feeling the sanctions-trig-
gered bump to the extent that they 
are. 
Democrats’ American Rescue Plan 
spending spree helped create our infla-
tion crisis. Americans need to look no 
further than the White House when 
wondering how the United States, a re-
cent net exporter of energy, is not on 
stronger footing to weather these tu-
multuous times. 
The President has pursued an energy 
agenda that has done next to nothing 
to help drive energy prices down and is, 
in fact, almost guaranteed to increase 
energy prices long term and increase 
our reliance on foreign sources of oil. 
From the moment he took office, the 
President sent a negative signal to en-
ergy producers by making it clear that 
his administration was not going to be 
embracing conventional energy produc-
tion. 
He set the tone for his administra-
tion on day 1 by canceling the Key-
stone XL Pipeline—an environmentally 
responsible pipeline project that was 
already underway and that was to be 
paired with $1.7 billion in private in-
vestment and renewable energy to fully 
offset its operating emissions. 
He also almost immediately froze 
new oil and gas leases on Federal lands, 
sending a clear signal to oil and gas 
producers 
that 
his 
administration 
would be reluctant to work with them 
to increase American energy produc-
tion. 
Now, President Biden has recently 
been touting the number of available 
permits for oil and gas development, 
which is positive as far as it goes, but 
new permits have dropped precipi-
tously this year. And issuing permits 
alone isn’t enough to get development 
going. 
The Biden administration has thrown 
up roadblock after roadblock to actual 
energy development. Companies are 
struggling to break through regulatory 
redtape to actually get oil and gas de-
velopment up and running. For exam-
ple, they have struggled to obtain right 
of way to build essential development 
infrastructure, like access roads to oil 
rig sites. They are also struggling to 
get timely pipeline permits to trans-
port the oil and gas that they extract. 
Unfortunately, they know exactly 
how this administration feels about 
building pipelines. And the Biden ad-
ministration is fully responsible for

these problems. The administration 
has the ability to immediately take ac-
tion to expedite American oil and gas 
development by clearing away the red-
tape that companies are facing. 
It is refusing to do so. Instead, Presi-
dent Biden seems ready to increase our 
reliance on energy imports from des-
potic governments in volatile areas of 
the world. That is not acceptable. En-
ergy independence, relying on home-
grown production instead of foreign en-
ergy sources, is key for a number of 
reasons. 
For starters, energy security is na-
tional security. The more we rely on 
imports from other countries, the more 
that we are dependent on those coun-
tries. We have seen that during the 
current conflict in Ukraine. European 
companies like Germany have been un-
able to divest from Russian energy be-
cause they rely on that production. 
Without Russian energy, more than 
one country in Europe would face a 
dire energy shortage—as Putin is well 
aware. We don’t want to give another 
country that much power over us. 
Energy independence, and the robust 
energy production that comes with it, 
also reduces the risk to Americans 
from price hikes in the global market. 
The more oil and gas the United States 
produces as a share of the global mar-
ket, the more we are able to influence 
global supply, which is the leading 
driver of cost. 
The Biden administration has not 
been good for American energy inde-
pendence. We have increased our reli-
ance on foreign sources of energy dur-
ing this administration, including our 
reliance on Russian energy production. 
And now that we have banned Rus-
sian energy imports, President Biden 
seems ready to replace Russian energy, 
not with increased American produc-
tion but with oil and gas from human 
rights-challenged countries like Ven-
ezuela. 
I realize that President Biden and 
many Democrats would like to see the 
United States focus solely on alter-
native energy production, but the fact 
of the matter is that we are a long way 
from being able to rely exclusively on 
alternative 
energy 
technologies. 
Whether Democrats like it or not, our 
country is going to need oil and nat-
ural gas for quite a while yet, and all of 
Democrats’ 
wishful 
thinking 
isn’t 
going to change that. 
The answer is not to get that oil and 
natural gas from despots in volatile 
areas of the world but to get it from 
American energy production. 
President Biden and his administra-
tion may not be solely to blame for 
high gas prices, but they have the 
power. They have the power to help 
lower energy prices by unleashing 
American energy production—all of it, 
both alternative and conventional—and 
they are responsible for their failure to 
do so. 
We need an ‘‘all of the above’’ energy 
policy that embraces everything from 
oil and gas to hydroelectric and nu-
clear, to solar and wind. And when it 
comes to alternative energy produc-
tion, we need to invest in all proven 
clean energy technologies, not just the 
administration’s preferred technologies 
like electric vehicles. The administra-
tion has neglected important clean en-
ergy technologies like biofuels, which 
have demonstrated significant emis-
sions reductions versus conventional 
gasoline. 
As a resident of a rural state, I would 
like to see the administration get seri-
ous about leveraging agriculture as an 
energy solution and work to expand 
biofuel production and consumption. 
This means not only setting robust 
blending targets and rejecting specious 
small refinery exemptions but approv-
ing advanced fuels from corn kernel 
fiber and restoring the year-round sale 
of E15. 
Last week, I led a letter to the Presi-
dent with the Democratic whip and col-
leagues from both parties urging the 
President to enable E15 to be sold dur-
ing the upcoming travel season to pro-
vide Americans with a lower cost fuel 
that would help displace Russian oil. 
Yesterday, the President’s Press Sec-
retary said that ‘‘E15 was on the 
menu.’’ Well, it deserves real consider-
ation. American drivers can’t afford for 
the President not to take action. The 
President could get us on a path to 
lower energy prices today—today—by 
announcing that his administration 
will get serious about expediting Amer-
ican production of oil and natural gas. 
If he fails to do so, then he really will 
be responsible for the prices that 
Americans are facing at the pump and 
for the hit that our national security 
will take from our increasing reliance 
on foreign sources of energy. 
I hope the President will decide to 
unleash American production and put 
our Nation on a path to long-term en-
ergy independence. 
I yield the floor.

Without objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to seek unanimous consent 
to confirm four nominees to posts that 
are critical—critical—to our response 
to Putin’s war against Ukraine. 
Through smoke and rubble and artil-
lery fire, Ukrainians are leaving their 
homes with nothing more than a back-
pack, nothing more than their children 
in their hands. 
Over the past 20 days, Vladimir 
Putin’s illegal and horrific assault on 
Ukraine has led more than 3 million 
refugees to flee into neighboring coun-
tries. Those who remain are suffering 
from a dire and deteriorating humani-
tarian situation. 
With Putin’s army blocking aid con-
voys, millions of Ukrainians are facing 
lack of water, food, and heat. Mean-
while, Putin orders unprovoked, un-
justified attacks on civilians—shelling 
apartment buildings, bombing mater-
nity hospitals, and destroying kinder-
gartens, 
committing 
atrocities 
throughout the country. 
The United States and the world 
have a duty to exact costs on Putin, to 
demand accountability for war crimes, 
and to provide aid for the millions of 
innocent Ukrainians who are suffering. 
If we want to rise to this challenge, if 
we want to respond to the mounting 
human suffering, one thing is clear: We 
need to have the people in place—the 
people the President has selected—to 
lead and carry out this work. Their 
leadership is critical in our response to 
the growing crisis in Ukraine and the 
looming refugee crisis across Eastern 
Europe. They will fight to defend 
human rights when they are violated. 
They will fight to defend democracy 
when it is attacked. They will make 
sure we maximize the pain and the 
price Putin pays for this heinous war. 
NOMINATION OF JAMES C. O’BRIEN 
Mr. President, that is why we must 
confirm Jim O’Brien. He is the Presi-
dent’s nominee for Coordinator for 
Sanctions. This is our most significant 
tool against Putin and his regime— 
sanctions. He is the President’s nomi-
nee for Coordinator for Sanctions. Once 
confirmed, he will enhance the Biden 
administration’s efforts with our allies 
and partners to impose devastating 
costs on Russia. 
To date, more than 30 nations have 
joined 
this 
cause. 
Countries 
have 
stepped up that we never would have 
expected. But the fight is not over. We 
have to keep up the pressure. We must 
keep up coordination. And we must en-
sure that we are implementing and en-
forcing sanctions in concert with doz-
ens of countries around the globe. 
Now, I know my Republican col-
leagues agree that this must be a top 
priority. I have heard it on the Foreign 
Relations Committee: We need to do 
more sanctions. I have heard it on the 
Senate floor. I have heard it in the con-
versations with my colleagues: We need 
to do even more. I know they want our 
sanctions to be as effective as possible, 
so to them, I say: Confirm Jim O’Brien 
today. 
NOMINATION OF JULIETA VALLS NOYES 
Mr. President, now I can also give 
you 3 million reasons why we must 
confirm Julieta Valls Noyes, the nomi-
nee to be the Assistant Secretary for 
the Bureau for Population, Refugees, 
and Migration—because 3 million peo-
ple have already fled their homes in 
Ukraine; 3 million people have left a 
war-torn country with their dreams 
shattered, their children traumatized— 
3 million people who have no idea what 
the future holds. Even as I speak, that 
number has surely been surpassed. 
There is a reason we have the Popu-
lation, Refugees, and Migration Bu-
reau. There is a reason the President 
selects a qualified nominee to lead it. 
Ms. Noyes is that person. It is a trav-
esty that Ms. Noyes’s nomination has 
been languishing on the Senate floor 
for 148 days because of Republican 
holds. 
We need a Senate-confirmed leader in 
place to take charge of the U.S. re-
sponse to the refugee crisis forming in 
Europe, as well as the crises that al-
ready exist around the world. We need 
someone to work alongside our Euro-
pean allies as they face the fastest 
growing refugee crisis in Europe since 
World War II. We need her confirmed 
today—not tomorrow, not next week, 
today. 
NOMINATION OF ERIN ELIZABETH MCKEE 
Mr. President, the humanitarian cri-
sis inside Ukraine is worsening every 
day. We can all see it for ourselves. 
You can see the images of Mariupol, 
where more than 200,000 civilians re-
main under siege, cut off from food, 
fighting for their lives. You can see the 
frightened faces of children crossing 
the border into Poland, carrying only a 
teddy bear and a change of clothes. 
This is a trauma they will struggle 
with for the rest of their lives. 
So it baffles me that we would wait 
another hour, let alone another day, to

even think about confirming Ambas-
sador Erin McKee as the Assistant Sec-
retary for Europe and Eurasia at 
USAID. The minute she gets in the 
door, the minute we send her to 
USAID, she will get to work on behalf 
of the millions of Ukrainians who are 
suffering. She will make sure that we 
are meeting basic needs and that we 
are helping Ukraine’s neighbors shoul-
der the burden of the crisis. Let her get 
to work. Let her help the people of 
Ukraine today. 
NOMINATION OF C.S. ELIOT KANG 
Mr. President, finally, there is a dan-
ger that Putin will unleash a chemical 
weapons attack against Ukraine. The 
Bureau of International Security and 
Nonproliferation has a crucial role to 
play here, not just to prevent the 
spread of chemical weapons but to help 
safeguard all nuclear materials and fa-
cilities in Ukraine. To do this, the 
nominee to be Assistant Secretary for 
that Bureau—International Security 
and Nonproliferation—Dr. Eliot Kang, 
would work with the Ukrainian Gov-
ernment, our allies, and the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency. But 
because of Republican delays, he has 
not yet been confirmed, despite the 
fact that he was nominated 328 days 
ago—328 days ago. Think about that. 
That was almost a year ago, and he has 
not yet been confirmed. 
Because we cannot wait, because the 
people of Ukraine cannot wait, I rise to 
seek unanimous consent for the con-
firmation of these four nominees. Each 
of them moved through the Foreign 
Relations Committee with bipartisan 
support. There is no reason for Repub-
licans to block their confirmation. The 
situation in Ukraine is dire, and our 
national security demands it. 
Because of that, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate consider the 
following nominations en bloc: Cal-
endar Nos. 462, 783, and 784; that the 
Senate vote on the nominations en bloc 
without intervening action or debate; 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate; 
that any statements related to the 
nominations be printed in the RECORD; 
and that the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, the Biden 
administration has failed to properly 
oversee the Pan American Health Orga-
nization, or PAHO. President Biden 
and 
Secretary 
Blinken 
know 
that 
PAHO has cooperated with the com-
munist regime in Cuba to traffic doc-
tors overseas, and they know that 
there are Cuban doctors who are trying 
to sue PAHO and hold their traffickers 
accountable. 
Here are the facts: In July 2013, the 
Cuban Ministry of Health signed an 
agreement with the Brazilian Ministry 
of Health to formalize an arrangement 
for Cuban doctors to provide medical 
services in Brazil. That agreement re-
quired the administration of former 
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff to 
transmit a monthly payment through 
PAHO to the Cuban Ministry of Health 
for the medical services provided by 
each Cuban doctor serving in Brazil. It 
also prevented Cuban doctors from 
seeking employment in Brazil outside 
of the formal structure of the agree-
ment. 
More than 20,000 Cuban medical pro-
fessionals serving in Brazil under the 
Mais Me´dicos Program had their wages 
stolen by the Cuban Government and 
received only a small fraction of what 
they earned. Their family members 
were prohibited from accompanying 
them, and many had their passports 
confiscated. 
Cuban doctors were the only medical 
professionals participating in the Mais 
Me´dicos Program who had their sala-
ries directly garnished by their govern-
ment. Meanwhile, doctors from other 
countries serving in Brazil received the 
full wages for their medical services. 
Other Cuban doctors suffered similar 
abuses in Angola, Guatemala, Mexico, 
Qatar, and Venezuela. For example, in 
2019, a group of Cuban doctors reported 
that they had been directed and often 
coerced to use their medical services to 
influence votes in favor of the Maduro 
regime, including by denying medical 
treatment to opposition supporters and 
by giving precise voting instructions to 
elderly patients. 
This gross program is a huge money-
maker for the communist ruling thugs 
in Cuba. In 2018 alone, they deposited 
more than $6.3 billion from exporting 
Cuban professionals to work overseas, 
and medical missions by Cuban doctors 
represent a majority of those profits. 
Since I came to the Senate in 2019, I 
have been fighting for these Cuban doc-
tors and against human trafficking. I 
know my colleague from New Jersey 
has also voiced concerns about this 
issue in the past, but nothing has been 
done to hold PAHO accountable. PAHO 
is hiding behind legal immunity. Presi-
dent Biden has the power to lift their 
immunity, and I have requested this 
administration to do so multiple times, 
but they have shamefully declined. 
It is wrong. Victims of trafficking de-
serve to see their alleged abusers in 
court, and PAHO should never be able 
to hide behind claims of immunity to 
avoid accountability for their role in 
facilitating those abuses. 
I have informed Secretary Blinken 
that until substantial steps toward ful-
filling this request are made, I will be 
blocking all relevant State Depart-
ment nominees. 
Americans 
deserve 
qualified 
and 
competent people in positions of power 
who put American interests first. If 
this administration wants to appease 
dictators, like they have with the Cas-
tro and Diaz-Canal regimes, I am going 
to hold them accountable. 
Therefore, Madam President, I ob-
ject. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). Objection is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
would like to ask the Senator from 
Florida, through the Chair, does the 
Assistant Administrator for Europe 
and Eurasia at USAID have anything 
to do with PAHO? 
Does the Assistant Secretary for 
International 
Security 
and 
Non-
proliferation have anything to do with 
PAHO? 
I guess the Senator doesn’t want to 
engage in a colloquy. 
Madam President, it is amazing to 
me. My colleagues who get up and ap-
plaud Zelenskyy, my colleagues who 
come to the Senate floor and talk 
about both the need to help Ukraine 
and the humanitarian realities that are 
compounding every day—and yet here 
we are with four pertinent, key posi-
tions that could help in regard to each 
and every one of those elements, and 
on some unrelated issue, not Ukraine, 
not even Europe, not about prolifera-
tion, not about humanitarian response, 
no, there is a wholesale objection. 
Now, if you wanted to pick your ob-
jection and target it, that might make 
sense, but I am deeply troubled that 
the junior Senator from Florida is once 
again obstructing the Senate’s respon-
sibility to provide advice and consent 
on Presidential nominations, not only 
preventing us from fulfilling our con-
stitutional duties, but in this case, 
moreover, he is singlehandedly under-
mining the ability of the U.S. Govern-
ment to respond fully to Russia’s bru-
tal invasion. In doing so, he seeks to 
singlehandedly damage our ability to 
ensure a coordinated international ef-
fort to sanction Putin, his cronies, sec-
tors of the Russian Government. 
He is undercutting the U.S. Govern-
ment’s ability to support the Ukrain-
ian people and our allies. He is under-
cutting our ability to provide and co-
ordinate the humanitarian assistance 
for 3 million Ukrainians who have left 
and millions more who are inside the 
country and need help. It is mind-bog-
gling—mind boggling. Get up, (ap-
plauds) and then come to the floor and 
object to the very things that can 
make it happen. Mind-boggling. 
Now, let me address the issue that 
the junior Senator from Florida has 
raised here today—the Cuban regime’s 
trafficking of doctors and medical per-
sonnel. Simply put, the Diaz-Canel re-
gime, like the Castro regime before it, 
does subject Cuban doctors to forced 
labor schemes abroad while pocketing 
the doctors’ wages in profit-making 
schemes that generate billions of dol-
lars annually. 
Now, I have been working on this 
issue since before my colleague ever 
held public office. I have engaged mul-
tiple administrations on this issue. I 
have actually authored legislation and 
resolutions on the subject. So my track 
record for standing up for Cuban doc-
tors who are trafficked by the Cuban 
regime eclipses that of any other Mem-
ber of Congress, period. But, my God, 
as passionate as I am about that 
issue—no one would be more passionate

March 16, 2022 
than me—it is not right to hold up ev-
erything we are trying to do on 
Ukraine. 
This is a global emergency. The fate 
of not only Ukraine but of democracy 
and its ability to achieve victory is 
under threat. And here we have objec-
tions to critical positions that can help 
us make sure that we win in that bat-
tle. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Madam President, let me try one 
other thing. I want to make in order 
the same request that I previously 
made with respect to Calendar No. 788, 
Erin Elizabeth McKee, to be an Assist-
ant Administrator of the United States 
Agency for International Development. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
so here we go. The person who would be 
responsible for helping the humani-
tarian challenge in Ukraine and in the 
surrounding countries where 3 million 
people have fled to, we can’t get her in 
position—can’t get her into a position 
to do the job to help millions of 
Ukrainians who are fleeing. 
I don’t understand how the party of 
Reagan, the party of freedom and de-
mocracy, the party of standing up to 
these people can actually create a set 
of circumstances where this is like 
helping Putin at the end of the day. It 
is like helping Putin at the end of the 
day. 
Now, while Senator MARSHALL didn’t 
speak to it, I understand his concerns 
are about COVID origins. Well, there is 
nothing wrong with that. It has been a 
lively topic of discussion in many fo-
rums, including the Senate. But these 
things have nothing to do with what 
Ambassador McKee is nominated for: 
Assistant Administrator for Europe 
and Eurasia. 
All of us, including Senator MAR-
SHALL, know that we need to do every-
thing possible to support Ukrainians in 
their time of need. Blocking Ambas-
sador McKee is self-defeating. 
It is also not clear to me what more 
USAID can do to satisfy Senator MAR-
SHALL. I have inquired because I heard 
this was the issue. USAID has been en-
gaged at the most senior levels in try-
ing to be helpful and responsive to Sen-
ator MARSHALL. They offered him and 
his team briefings, and I understand 
that none of those offers have been ac-
cepted. They have also pointed Senator 
MARSHALL’s office to a wealth of infor-
mation on specific USAID projects of 
interest. 
So I would urge the Senator, instead 
of 
blocking 
nominees, 
to 
act 
on 
USAID’s multiple briefing offers and 
engage them meaningfully. That would 
be more helpful to his ultimate goal— 
but not to be helping Putin, at the end 
of the day, by not being able to take 
care of the humanitarian needs of the 
Ukrainians. 
I have seen a lot over my course of 40 
years in public service and 30 years in 
the Congress. I just—this is mind-bog-
gling. But more than that, it really un-
dermines our national security. It real-
ly undermines our help with the 
Ukrainian people. And so I hope that 
some saner minds will prevail in the 
days ahead when I come back to the 
floor to try this once again. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am joined on the floor today by 
my friend and colleague Senator GRA-
HAM. We have the honor of coleading 
the U.S. congressional delegation to 
the Munich Security Conference, which 
for a great number of reasons, all well- 
deserved, is still called CODEL McCain. 
It is the only codel that is named for a 
Senator who is no longer with us, and 
it 
is 
out 
of 
respect 
for 
Senator 
McCain’s long tradition of support for 
that conference, NATO, and the Atlan-
tic alliance, more generally. 
This year, obviously things were very 
different. The Russians were on the 
border of Ukraine, and two things came 
out of this conference that I thought 
were important. One was an early 
flicker of hope within the delegation 
that the Ukrainians might actually 
pull this off. That was supported by 
none of our briefings. The entire na-
tional security establishment had pre-
sumed that it was only a matter of 
time until Ukraine fell. But Senator 
GRAHAM and I and others were ques-
tioning each other during that trip: Is 
there really no chance? 
And the other thing was going after 
the 
kleptocrats 
and 
the 
oligarchs 
around Putin and making their lives 
miserable. And there was just a won-
derful explosion of bipartisan support 
for that that has now manifested in 
funds, in laws, in pending bills, in lots 
of bipartisanship—and Senator GRAHAM 
and I are going to have a bit of a col-
loquy about that with the Chair’s per-
mission. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will say one 
thing, and then I will hand it over to 
Senator GRAHAM. 
On March 8, I sent out over social 
media this sentiment: 
Keep alive in your heart the possibility 
that Ukraine could actually win: columns 
stalled, defense fierce, casualties high, mo-
rale low, deserters surrendering, food and 
fuel snafu, population uncowed. 
Since then, we are hearing more and 
more. I will read four quotes, and the 
first is from the man we heard from 
this morning, the President of Ukraine, 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who, in his 
speech to the people of Ukraine on 
March 14, didn’t just talk about peace 
for Ukraine—although, he did talk 
about peace for Ukraine, but he also 
talked about ‘‘our victory.’’ Victory. It 
is an important word to keep in mind. 
He is not alone. 
GEN Wesley Clark, also on March 14, 
said: 
The battle for Ukraine is hanging in the 
balance. . . . If we can get enough in there, 
they’ll push the Russians out. 
Victory. 
It would be a tremendous win for the West. 
Anne Applebaum knows probably 
about as much about this area as any-
one. She joined us on the Munich secu-
rity delegation, and she also spoke 
afterward on the 15th of March about 
it. She said: 
[V]ictory in this conflict— 
Victory— 
[V]ictory . . . would provide an enormous, 
transformational boost in confidence to the 
entire democratic world. 
Michael Kofman, the director of Rus-
sian studies at the Center for Naval 
Analyses has said the same thing: ‘‘Are 
[the Ukrainians] in a position to win 
the war? Yes,’’ he said. 
I will close with Francis Fukuyama. 
On the 10th of March, the author of 
‘‘The Origins of Political Order’’ said 
the following things. I am quoting from 
a longer piece selectively. 
1. Russia is heading for outright defeat in 
Ukraine. 
2. The collapse of their position could be 
sudden and catastrophic, rather than hap-
pening slowly through a war of attrition. 
The army in the field will reach a point 
where it can neither be supplied nor with-
drawn, and morale will vaporize. 
5. The Biden administration’s decisions not 
to declare a no-fly zone or help transfer Pol-
ish MiGs were both good ones; they’ve kept 
their heads during a very emotional time. It 
is much better to have the Ukrainians defeat 
the Russians on their own, depriving Moscow 
of the excuse that NATO attacked them. 
Finally, he said: 
A Russian defeat will make possible a 
‘‘new birth of freedom,’’ and get us out of our 
funk about the declining state of global de-
mocracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, 
thanks to . . . brave Ukrainians. 
We are here together on the floor in 
bipartisan fashion to urge that in the 
press coverage and in our national se-
curity conversations about this, we 
keep open in our hearts and in our 
planning the possibility of victory for 
Ukraine. 
Senator GRAHAM. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Well, thank you. All I 
can say is, SHELDON, thank you. 
John is no longer with us, but I think 
he is here in spirit at this moment. If 
Senator McCain were here, there would 
be 27 MiGs they would want to transfer 
because he would probably be in one, 
headed for Ukraine. 
The bottom line is, 20 days into this 
fight, we are all amazed at how bad the 
Russians are doing and how well the 
Ukrainians are doing. And I think what 
Senator WHITEHOUSE is trying to re-
mind us all of is that the outcome of 
Ukraine really does matter to the 
world at large. 
Senator McCain was known for his 
support of the transatlantic alliance, a

March 16, 2022 
rules-based 
society, 
a 
values-based 
world, and Putin has put that in jeop-
ardy. 
So let’s look at it this way. If Putin 
wins, SHELDON, then the largest war 
criminal in the 21st century survives 
the dismemberment of a neighboring 
democracy, slaughter of the innocents 
on a mass scale. If he is still standing, 
I think China understands what to do 
with Taiwan more clearly; the Iranians 
are more bold when it comes to their 
nuclear ambitions; and the ripple effect 
in Asia and the Middle East will be felt 
if Putin wins. 
Now, if Putin loses and Ukraine 
wins—victory for Ukraine—I think it 
would be the biggest change for the 
good since World War II. What would it 
mean? It would mean that a murderous 
war criminal who tried to use force of 
arms to impose his will on his neighbor 
lost. It would mean that the good guys 
won and the bad guys lost, and China 
would have to think twice about Tai-
wan. 
How do we make sure victory for 
Ukraine is maximized? Only God knows 
how this ends, but here is what I think 
we can do in working together, with 
three lines of effort: 
Economic and military aid. We have 
had a very robust package leave the 
Congress. The President announced 
$800 million more in military aid 
today. We have a difference about the 
MiGs, but otherwise we are pretty 
much on the same sheet of music. 
Sanctions against Russia. The war is 
not against the Russian people. They 
are in many ways victims of Putin as 
much as anybody. Unfortunately, the 
only way we can bring this to a conclu-
sion and have victory for Ukraine is to 
crush the Russian economy, so sec-
ondary sanctions need to be on the 
table. Then, if China comes to Putin’s 
aid, they need to understand the con-
sequences of that decision. 
So we are all in on sanctions, and 
secondary sanctions are now in play. 
The Ukrainian Ambassador asked me 
yesterday to broaden the sanctions to 
Russian officials in different regions 
that are part of Putin’s war machine. 
President Zelenskyy asked for that 
today, too. 
My good friend SHELDON WHITEHOUSE 
has been speaking about victory when 
nobody else hardly will, and I am here 
to say that victory for Ukraine is vic-
tory for America; it is victory for the 
rule of law; and it is victory for the 
post-World War II order that has led to 
historic prosperity. 
Three lines of effort: military assist-
ance, including MiGs; economic aid— 
fuel, food, humanitarian airlift if that 
is feasible; crushing sanctions; labeling 
Putin the war criminal that he is; and 
letting every Russian military com-
mander know that, if you pick his side 
and you carry out these war crimes 
against the Ukrainian people, we are 
coming after you. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE and myself met 
with the British Foreign Secretary and 
Ambassador to create a joint effort, an 
intel cell, to collect information about 
Russian units engaged in war crimes in 
Ukraine and start putting the com-
mander’s name out for the world to un-
derstand so they will know that we are 
watching them. 
How does this end? The Russian peo-
ple end the reign of terror in Putin. It 
is in their hands. I encourage them to 
do it. 
Finally, if there has been one voice 
on kleptocracy, it is SHELDON’s. He has 
got it on climate change. He is deter-
mined to see that issue through to the 
end, but Senator WHITEHOUSE was talk-
ing about kleptocracy long before the 
invasion. So we are introducing to-
gether the Asset Seizure for Ukraine 
Reconstruction Act, which is an effort 
by our government, joining with inter-
national partners, to get every yacht 
we can get, raid every bank account we 
can find, take the money away from 
the thieves, and give it back to the 
Ukrainian people and eventually to the 
Russian people. 
What Senator WHITEHOUSE and I are 
trying to do in a bipartisan fashion is 
to make the war real to the oligarchs. 
Without the oligarchs, there is no 
Putin. It is time for them to enjoy the 
experience of having their assets that 
they stole taken away from them. 
‘‘Enjoy’’ is maybe not the right word. 
It is time for us to enjoy the sight of 
Russian oligarchs having their prop-
erty taken that they achieved through 
thievery. It is time for us to start put-
ting people in jail who engaged in the 
mass theft of the Russian people. 
Victory for Ukraine is possible, I 
think, if we are all in on sanctions, if 
we are all in on labeling, naming, and 
shaming people around Putin as war 
criminals in order to break their will, 
and if we begin to pour it on when it 
comes to regaining control of the skies. 
I am not for a NATO no-fly zone be-
cause I think that would put us in a 
situation with NATO and Russia that I 
am not comfortable with right now, 
but I am for Ukraine controlling their 
skies, a no-fly zone enforced by the 
Ukrainian military. That is why I want 
more anti-aircraft systems and the 
MiGs. 
The bottom line here is that victory 
for Ukraine is possible because I think 
the Russian people and the Russian 
military are really not into this. I 
think the world is coalescing around 
the idea that if Putin wins, it is bad for 
us all. Now is the time. This is the 
most historically significant moment 
since the end of World War II for the 
continent of Europe and for freedom 
itself and for the rule of law. 
If we can pull this off, then those who 
come after us will be very pleased with 
our efforts. If we fail, future genera-
tions will wonder ‘‘What the hell were 
you doing?’’ just like we all wonder 
how Hitler could have gotten so strong 
and nobody stopped him when they 
could have. 
Let it be said in this moment of his-
tory that Senator WHITEHOUSE, Sen-
ator GRAHAM, and many others, par-
ticularly the Ukrainian people, believe 
not only is victory for Ukraine pos-
sible, it is absolutely necessary. 
With that, I turn it back over to my 
colleague. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, in conclusion, let me just thank 
Senator GRAHAM. He has been an ex-
traordinary leader on the Munich Secu-
rity delegation year after year, and I 
think he has a ‘‘McCainian’’ view of 
our foreign policy needs. 
I would close by saying, if there is a 
lesson 
from 
Ukraine, 
it 
is 
that 
oligarchs can throw out a dictator if 
you put pressure on them. So the 
kleptocracy initiative is important 
strategically in Ukraine, and it also 
puts in motion forces that can dimin-
ish kleptocracy and corruption around 
the world in a way that enhances our 
rule of law and national security. 
The press has tended to buy into the 
narrative of defeat but not entirely. 
Sudarsan Raghavan went to the front 
for the Washington Post, and he re-
ported back this: 
To be sure, most military analysts and 
Western officials still predict that Russian 
forces will eventually encircle Kyiv and push 
into the capital, possibly aided by airstrikes. 
While this could prove true, it’s far from 
clear whether Russia will prevail. 
That leaves open the important plan-
ning option of victory for Ukraine. 
Then, when bad news comes, some-
times it is just not the whole story. 
The BBC reported the bad news that 
Russian forces were already inside the 
city of Irpin. Well, there is a little bit 
more to the story than that. 
A Ukrainian army officer said that 
Ukrainian forces were waiting for civil-
ians to evacuate Irpin before ‘‘we start 
to clear the city of Russians.’’ 
They don’t have enough provisions—food, 
water. They don’t have a lot of gasoline. 
They will get tired, and then we will go and 
drive them out. 
Well, it appears that that counter-
offensive is underway right now, as we 
speak. 
As I close, I think all of our hearts

REMEMBERING BRENT RENAUD, PIERRE 
ZAKRZEWSKI, AND OLEKSANDRA KUVSHYNOVA 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, over 
the course of just 3 days, the world lost 
three talented, tenacious journalists to 
Vladimir Putin’s war crimes and brutal 
invasion of Ukraine. 
Brent Renaud was a Peabody Award- 
winning documentary filmmaker who 
was working to tell the stories of 
Putin’s war when he was fatally shot in 
the Kyiv suburb of Irpin on Sunday. 
Then, on Monday, two more journal-
ists with FOX News lost their lives 
when their vehicle came under fire just 
outside of Kyiv. A cameraman and vet-
eran war reporter, Pierre Zakrzewski, 
was killed. He had been reporting in 
Ukraine since February.

We also lost Ukrainian journalist 
Oleksandra ‘‘Sasha’’ Kuvshynova, who 
was serving as a consultant for FOX’s 
team in Ukraine. She was just 24 years 
old. 
Their colleague, correspondent Ben-
jamin Hall, was also injured, and he re-
mains in the hospital. 
Journalists know they face danger 
when they report from war zones. They 
put themselves in harm’s way to tell 
the world the true stories that we need 
to hear. 
Today, the Presiding Officer from 
Minnesota joined me and dozens and 
dozens of others to see the video, the 
pictures, and the photos of the war in 
Ukraine, which were shown to us by 
President Zelenskyy. Those pictures— 
many of them—were taken by very 
courageous 
journalists 
who 
risked 
their own lives. They bring us the un-
varnished truth, unfiltered by govern-
ment propaganda, at the times when 
we need it most. They are committed 
to basic ideals of truth, accuracy, and 
transparency—so committed that they 
put their lives on the line to make sure 
the world knows what is happening. 
Their commitment to these ideals only 
makes their deaths that much more 
tragic. 
Today, three families and so many 
colleagues are grieving for these three 
journalists, grieving losses that cannot 
be replaced. They shouldn’t have to. 
This war was started by a man with 
no regard for the freedom of the press 
or basic human rights; a man who is a 
former KGB agent and has open con-
tempt and hostility toward real report-
ers, toward real journalism, toward 
free speech; a man who presides over a 
regime wherein journalists are killed 
with impunity. 
According to the Committee to Pro-
tect Journalists, 28 journalists have 
been killed in Russia since Putin came 
to power 20 years ago, and 10 are cur-
rently in prison simply for telling the 
truth, for doing their jobs. According 
to Reporters Without Borders, Russia 
ranks 150 out of 199 countries for press 
freedom. They are actually behind Af-
ghanistan and South Sudan and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
Last October, the United States and 
18 other countries issued a statement, 
warning of ‘‘the Russian government’s 
intensifying harassment of independent 
journalists and media outlets in Rus-
sia.’’ 
In 2020, the Russian Government 
began labeling many outside journal-
ists as ‘‘media foreign agents’’—a term 
reminiscent of the worst of the Cold 
War. 
It is not just foreign journalists; 
Putin’s government has applied the 
‘‘media foreign agent’’ label to inde-
pendent Russian outlets in the country 
or to those operating near the coun-
try’s border—Russian reporters them-
selves. It goes against all of our values. 
It is the kind of authoritarianism that 
the Ukrainian people bravely fight 
every day now. They don’t want their 
country to turn into a place where re-
porters fear for their lives, where jour-
nalists can’t tell the public the truth. 
Journalists’ entire job is to ask ques-
tions, to challenge powerful interests, 
to—shall 
we 
say—afflict 
the 
com-
fortable. 
Reporters put their safety and—as we 
saw with these three brave journalists 
in Ukraine—their lives on the line, 
whether it is covering floods and hurri-
canes in the United States or traveling 
the globe to bring us the stories of war 
zones. 
We depend on reporters in my State 
and around the world to bring us the 
stories that impact our day-to-day 
lives and tell the stories that might 
not otherwise be told. They are too 
often under attack overseas increas-
ingly. We recently had a President of 
the United States who attacked jour-
nalists in almost every stop. 
As we all stand with the people of 
Ukraine, let’s recommit ourselves to 
fighting just as hard as they are for our 
values, for freedom of the press, for 
free speech. These three journalists 
made the ultimate sacrifice to show 
the world the heroism of the Ukrainian 
people. We pray that they are the last 
who have to do that. 
We recognize that President Putin 
has been shocked by two things: 
shocked by the heroism of the Ukrain-
ian people—those fighting back, those 
brave journalists, those freedom fight-
ers, those mothers and fathers and 
children who have so courageously 
stood up against Russia; he is also 
shocked by the way President Biden so 
effectively has put together an inter-
national coalition, not just for the 
countries you would expect, but Ger-
many, and Finland, and Sweden, and 
Switzerland—countries that have rare-
ly chosen sides and stepped up the way 
that all of our countries have. 
And while doing this, we send our 
sympathy and our gratitude to the 
families of Brent Renaud, to Pierre 
Zakrzewski, 
to 
Oleksandra 
Kuvshynova. They died doing the vital 
heroic work they love. We have a bet-
ter understanding of this invasion, of 
the war crimes being committed, of 
how it is affecting people’s lives. We 
have a better understanding because of 
journalists like them, and we thank 
them from the bottom of our hearts. 
REMEMBERING FRED ABDALLA 
Madam President, I would like to re-
member an Ohio public servant whom 
we lost this year, longtime friend of 
mine, Jefferson County Sheriff—East-
ern Ohio, along the Pennsylvania-West 
Virginia line, along the Ohio River— 
Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla. 
He took office in January 1985. He 
served his community ever since for 
nearly four decades, in his sheriff’s car, 
going up and down the river, going to 
Mingo Junction and Tiltonsville to 
Steubenville, to Wintersville—all over 
Jefferson County. He served that com-
munity. 
His colleagues and his neighbors 
called him tough but big-hearted. He 
was particularly passionate about solv-
ing crimes against children and sen-
iors. 
His chief deputy, Susan Bell, worked 
with Sheriff Abdalla for 32 years. She 
said: 
He and I had a lot of cases together. He 
laughed a lot. . . . We cried a lot. . . . We 
worked as a team. 
His colleagues at the department 
posted a moving remembrance of Jef-
ferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla. 
They wrote: 
Although we miss you dearly, we will carry 
on as you’ve taught us to do in the face of 
adversity. One of the last ‘‘working sheriffs,’’ 
you were always involved and answered calls 
with your staff. You led by example. [You] 
never ordered a deputy to do something you 
would not do yourself. 
Our thoughts are with his family, 
with the people of Jefferson County. 
His passing is a real loss for my State, 
for all who knew him. His dedication to 
his community will not be forgotten. 
Rest in peace, Fred Abdalla. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JOHN H. CHUN 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor this evening to sup-
port the nomination of John Chun, who 
is to serve as judge for the U.S. Dis-
trict Court of Western Washington, and 
I know that we will be voting later to-
night on that nomination. 
I was proud to recommend to Presi-
dent Biden Judge Chun, who then was 
nominated by the President. My col-
league Senator MURRAY and I know 
what a qualified individual he is to 
serve our country. 
He has spent his entire legal career 
practicing law in the Western District 
of Washington, making him deeply 
knowledgeable of the district that he 
will serve. He is well-prepared for the 
Western District and offers a unique 
perspective to the bench, having served 
as a superior court judge for 4 years be-
fore joining the court of appeals in 
2018, as well as his tenure in private 
practice. 
Through his extensive courtroom ex-
perience as a former trial judge and 
current appellate judge, he has had 
much time as a trial litigator. He will 
be ready on day one to serve effectively 
on the Federal district court bench. 
Judge Chun has received profound 
support for his nomination to the U.S. 
district court. Not only did his nomina-
tion receive bipartisan support from 
the Senate Judiciary Committee; it 
also received support from the Amer-
ican Bar Association, which unani-
mously rated him ‘‘well qualified’’ to 
serve in this position. 
In addition to the endorsement from 
the National Asian Pacific American

As I am sure my colleagues can see, 
Judge Chun is immensely qualified to

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I 
would ask unanimous consent to speak 
as if in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise, 
as so many of us have of late, to talk 
about the invasion of Ukraine by Rus-
sia. This invasion, as we know, started 
on February 24, and it is now, I guess, 
in its 21st or 22nd day. 
At the time of the invasion—I think 
it was the day after or 2 days after—I 
was reading in a newspaper the ref-
erence to one resident of Ukraine who 
said the following about the onset of 
the hostilities by Vladimir Putin and 
Russia: 
It was the worst sunrise in my life. 
I can’t even begin to imagine what 
that individual in Ukraine or tens of 
thousands of families were feeling on 
that day, and hundreds of thousands 
throughout 
the 
country—millions, 
even. 
This attack, which is ongoing, was 
both unprovoked and unjustified. It is 
an attack on a sovereign nation by a 
murderous dictator who has no regard 
for human life and no regard for the 
rules-based international order. I think 
a lot of people knew that before the in-
vasion, but now it is abundantly clear 
to the world what Vladimir Putin’s in-
tentions are and what his practices are 
when it comes to attacking a sovereign 
nation. 
The New York Times told us last Fri-
day, March 11, about Putin. I am 
quoting here from the New York 
Times, and they made reference in this 
story to his actions in Syria, as well as 
Chechnya: 
[H]e has demonstrated in [the] past . . . a 
willingness not only to bomb heavily popu-
lated areas indiscriminately but also to use 
civilian casualties as leverage against his en-
emies. 
‘‘[U]se civilian casualties as lever-
age’’—that is the dictator that the peo-
ple of Ukraine are dealing with right 
now. And I think it is clear from the 
reporting, and so many Americans 
have read the stories and have seen the 
coverage of the bombings. It is clear 
that he is bombing indiscriminately. It 
is clear that he and his army, his mili-
tary, are targeting civilians. 
All you have to do is look at the list 
of locations. And the list would be hun-
dreds if we read all of them, but here 
are just a couple examples. Maybe the 
most graphic in the last couple of days 
was the bombing of a maternity ward 
and that footage of a stretcher coming 
out of that rubble with a pregnant 
woman, who has since died, as did her 
child. That is an example of that kind 
of indiscriminate bombing. 
But in addition to a maternity ward, 
he has bombed a shoe factory, a psy-
chiatric hospital, apartment buildings, 
cafes, homes, parking lots near a shop-
ping center, bombing near a kinder-
garten, bombing of a mosque, bomb-
ing—we are told, the most recent num-
ber—34 medical facilities, damaged in 
Ukraine. And that number, of course, 
will grow. Most recently, just in the 
last day or so, a supermarket, and, I 
think, at least a 12-story residential 
tower. 
And then, just today, another ref-
erence to just one example of the bru-
tality of Putin: 10 people killed waiting 
in line for bread in Ukraine. The ad-
viser to the mayor of one of the most 
besieged cities, Mariupol, said the fol-
lowing. This adviser said: 
Humanity has not yet invented a word to 
describe what Russia is doing to us. 
I think that says it all. There is no 
way to describe what is happening. The 
world has never seen this, in recent 
history. Maybe the closest example 
would be what happened in Syria, 
which, of course, was also paid for and 
led by the Russian military, Mr. Putin. 
Despite all that horror and all that 
bloodshed and all that is to follow, de-
spite all of that grim reminder of the 
brutality of Mr. Putin, the Ukrainian 
people have inspired so many of us. 
When I say ‘‘us,’’ I don’t mean just vot-
ing Members of Congress or people 
throughout the country. They have in-
spired people the world over. I have 
never seen anything in my lifetime 
that equates to the inspiration that 
they have generated; their courage— 
the raw physical courage of the people, 
of the military, and all the contribu-
tions they are making to their coun-
try—their resolute determination to 
protect their freedom, to protect their 
families, to protect their nation, and, 
really, when you think about it in a 
larger sense, to protect democracy 
itself, because that is really very much 
on the line in Ukraine. 
The Ukrainian people’s stubborn re-
fusal to be intimidated by a ruthless 
autocrat and his military has inspired 
so many people every single day. I just 
saw another example this morning. 
Women who have left Ukraine with 
their children, to bring their children 
to safety, coming back into Ukraine to 
join the fight or, in some cases, I guess, 
to rejoin the fight—women putting 
their lives at risk for their country. 
This morning the Presiding Officer 
and all of us, the Members of Congress, 
had the honor to listen to President 
Zelenskyy’s address to the Congress, 
and I know the Nation saw it as well. 
His address this morning was also in-
spiring, every bit as inspiring as that 
engendered by his people. But his ad-
dress was also a call to action for us to 
do more. We have got to do more. And 
we have got to provide additional sup-
port. 
President Zelenskyy thanked our 
President, President Biden, and the 
American people for all the support 
that we have provided, especially in 
the last couple of weeks since the inva-
sion began but also before that. 
And President Biden responded just 2 
or 3 hours later when he announced 
even more military assistance or secu-
rity assistance, which, if you add up 
just that part of the support, just since 
he took office, is now at about $2 bil-
lion. That doesn’t include other sup-
port like humanitarian support. 
But here is just a quick list of what 
that security assistance is. I will just 
itemize a few. This isn’t exhaustive, 
but it is just some examples: Stinger 
anti-aircraft 
systems—we 
provided 
many hundreds of them, and now we 
are providing a lot more than that—the 
Javelin anti-armor systems that have 
had such success against the Russian 
military, Russian tanks; helicopters; 
patrol boats; grenade launchers; guns 
and ammunition; grenades; mortar and 
artillery rounds; secure communica-
tions; military medical equipment; on 
and on and on. 
And, as I mentioned, the President 
responded specifically today by an-
nouncing that the United States will 
add $800 million just on security assist-
ance, bringing that total, as I said, to 
$2 billion since he began his adminis-
tration. It was noteworthy that two of 
the 
component 
parts 
of 
that—the 
Stinger systems and the Javelins—both 
are being used with great skill by the 
Ukrainian fighters. The increase in 
those numbers is not just a few hun-
dred. In both cases it is either doubling 
or tripling what we have already done. 
And we will do more. We will continue 
to do more. 
Congress has passed a spending bill 
just a couple of days ago, at the end of 
last week, and the President signed it 
this week, which allowed that $800 mil-
lion to be available. 
So that is the good news: more 
money for weapons and other security 
assistance, more money for humani-
tarian support. That number is grow-
ing all the time because of the need 
that the Ukrainian people have. 
The sanctions—the crushing, unprec-
edented sanctions—that already are 
having effect. I had a briefing today 
just on that topic of the impact of the 
sanctions, and it is substantial, and it 
will only grow as time goes by. We will 
have more time later to talk about 
that. And, of course, the contribution, 
as well—all of these are contributions 
of not just our government but our 
people. The American people made 
these contributions of military assist-
ance and humanitarian support and our

ability to impose sanctions with our al-
lies, with our NATO partners. 
But at the same time, what gets lost 
sometimes in the discussion about 
Ukraine is the intelligence support we 
have provided—all kinds of offices 
throughout our intelligence commu-
nity providing actionable intelligence 
or intelligence that the Ukrainians can 
use if they fight the battle, fight the 
war. That is probably incalculable in 
terms of the advantages given on the 
battlefield and beyond. So that bears 
emphasis as well. 
I think one area of positive develop-
ment in the last couple of months is 
the unity, not just the unity of NATO, 
which has never been stronger, prob-
ably never stronger since the 1960s or 
even more so, but the unity here at 
home—unity in the Senate, unity in 
the House, unity throughout the coun-
try to support the people of Ukraine— 
the people but also to support the mili-
tary. 
I have to say, though, as much as we 
have that unity with our NATO part-
ners and here in the Congress, there 
are voices here in Washington and 
around the country that are not as uni-
fied. We know the voice of our former 
President and his continued approval 
of Putin’s ‘‘genius.’’ 
Why would you ever say that about a 
murderous dictator? He is not a genius. 
He is, I believe, a war criminal, but 
that kind of language and that kind of 
support for Putin, at least by way of 
laudatory words, has tarnished that 
unity, has undermined that unity here 
at home and around the world. But it is 
not enough to break that unity. 
I just hope that Republican Members 
of Congress, when someone in their 
party, especially a leader of their party 
or a Member of Congress or any other 
Republican official—I hope that when 
they say things about Vladimir Putin 
that are positive or in any way sup-
portive that they would call it out and 
condemn it. 
When you are supporting the people 
of Ukraine at a time of war, you have 
to use every tool in your toolbox: mili-
tary assistance, diplomacy, sanctions, 
humanitarian support, but also your 
words as leaders. And we should be con-
demning any American leader who sup-
ports or says positive things about Mr. 
Putin. 
I hope the Republican Members of 
Congress who have stood up and been 
very supportive of the Ukrainian peo-
ple in this fight would also call out 
Members of their party and condemn 
such statements because that didn’t 
happen in July of 2018, when the former 
President—in my judgment, this is my 
view of it—was genuflecting before 
Vladimir Putin on the world stage in 
Helsinki, Finland, in probably what I 
believe is maybe the worst day for an 
American President on the world stage 
ever when he took the side of Mr. 
Putin, a murderous dictator, over the 
determinations made by our intel-
ligence community about the previous 
election. That was a low moment for 
America, for our democracy, and for 
our country. 
We now have, I think, very clearly a 
choice. It is not a choice of three or 
four options or five options. There are 
only two options here: You can choose 
Mr. Putin or choose Mr. Zelenskyy. 
You can choose a dictator who has no 
regard for human life and all of the 
enablers around him, or you can choose 
the President who is standing up for 
freedom, Mr. Zelenskyy, the President 
of Ukraine. 
It is really a simple choice. It is a 
choice between the incarnation of evil 
and the personification of freedom. 
That is the choice. There is not a third 
option here. Every American has to 
make this choice, but especially Mem-
bers of Congress, elected officials. That 
is part of our job. You have to make a 
choice, and it is very simple. 
The good news is Republicans, Demo-
crats, and Independents—House and 
Senate, the two branches of govern-
ment—have made a choice, and the 
American people have made a choice. 
They made a choice for freedom to sup-
port that personification of freedom by 
supporting Mr. Zelenskyy and his gov-
ernment in this war, by supporting the 
Ukrainian people, who are literally 
putting their lives on the line for free-
dom itself. 
I will conclude with these thoughts. 
Like our Constitution that we turn to 
for both—not just guidance and inspi-
ration, but we turn to, to remind our-
selves of our duty, so, too, are the peo-
ple of Ukraine turning to their Con-
stitution for that guidance and that in-
spiration and that call to action. 
Here is what that Constitution says 
in pertinent part, and it sounds very 
familiar: 
The people are the bearers of sovereignty 
and the only sources of power in Ukraine . . . 
To affirm and ensure human rights and free-
doms is the main duty of the State. 
That is what the Ukrainian Constitu-
tion says, a mandate that freedom 
must be the goal and the work of the 
State. Wow, are they doing that now. 
President Zelenskyy and his govern-
ment and the people of Ukraine are 
standing up for freedom. 
When we are at our best here at 
home, we do the same. We have a great 
anthem for our Nation: ‘‘O beautiful’’— 
and you know the rest of that great an-
them. One of the verses of that great 
anthem says: 
O beautiful for patriot dream that sees be-
yond the years. 
The dream of a patriot isn’t just to 
stand up in the moment and fight, but 
that patriot is standing up for freedom, 
fighting and willing to put their lives 
on the line—or his or her life on the 
line—for freedom because they are see-
ing beyond the years. They are stand-
ing up for freedom, not just for them-
selves and their families and their na-
tion, but for the future—for the future 
of that nation. That is what the people 
of Ukraine are doing right now, and 
that is why we have to continue to sup-
port them in that great fight. 
I think most Americans have already 
made the choice. We just have to back 
them up and stand for freedom—not to 
stand for the incarnation of evil, Mr. 
Putin and his government right now, 
but to stand for the personification of 
freedom. We saw that this morning 
with President Zelenskyy.

TRANSGENDER YOUTH 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today to speak out against 
the recent wave of hate attacks on 
transgender youth happening across 
our country. 
Over the last few months, we have 
seen extreme Republican lawmakers 
take unprecedented steps to go after 
trans children and their families. Not 
only are they spewing hateful rhetoric 
around gender identity—making some-
thing personal and something a lot of 
Americans probably don’t think about 
every day into a cruel political cudg-
el—but they are also using their polit-
ical power and legal authority to tar-
get trans people, and trans kids, in par-
ticular. 
Last month, Texas Governor Greg 
Abbott made the decision to actively 
investigate 
and 
target 
parents 
of 
transgender kids and providers, mak-
ing the totally false claim that gender- 
affirming care is child abuse. In Idaho, 
just across the border from my home 
State of Washington, lawmakers got 
dangerously close to passing legisla-
tion that would criminalize providers 
for giving kids the gender-affirming 
care they need. In Florida, there is a 
bill headed to the Governor’s desk 
which aims to erase gay and trans kids, 
parents, and teachers from our schools 
by banning any discussion about gen-
der identity or sexual orientation. 
While Democrats have been focused 
on getting our schools back open and 
helping students catch up after 2 really 
tough years, Republicans are targeting 
trans kids and gay students and taking 
incredibly important and personal de-
cisions away from parents and families. 
Right now, it feels like far-right law-
makers are in a race to legislate the 
most extreme, most hateful bill they 
can think of, at the expense of trans 
kids. We all have a responsibility to 
stand up and make clear this is not 
right. Trans people are our friends; 
they are our neighbors; they are our 
families. Trans kids deserve to be just 
kids—to play sports, to go to school, to 
see a doctor, or to get healthcare. They 
should be able to get the same opportu-
nities as any other child, to learn and 
grow and play and thrive free from fear 
and discrimination. And parents de-
serve to be able to make their own par-

providers to do what is best for their

worry about what a rightwing politi-

they definitely shouldn’t live in fear

that a State legislature is going to in-
tervene in their parenting decisions 
and hurt their child. 
So we have to push back against 
these attacks on trans kids in every 
way that we can—in the courts, with 
legislation, through Executive action, 
and by speaking out and speaking up 
because I can tell you, having just 
talked to my constituents in Wash-
ington State, the hurt and fear the 
Governor of Texas has caused is not 
staying in Texas. What Greg Abbott 
said about trans kids has an effect on 
many States. I wish it didn’t, but the 
truth is: All of those measures are not 
only really scary for trans families 
across the country, but they also em-
bolden more hateful rhetoric and even 
violence against trans people; and it is 
harming trans kids’ mental health no 
matter where they live. 
We have to be louder than Greg Ab-
bott or whoever is taking aim at trans 
kids. We have to push for legislation 
like the Equality Act that would send 
a powerful message of support and fair-
ness for trans and gay Americans. And 
we have to stand up for a future with-
out this hateful hate, harm, and divi-
sion that we are seeing and with a lot 
more compassion for each other. It is 
not too much to ask. 
NOMINATION OF JOHN H. CHUN 
Mr. President, I also rise today to 
urge my colleagues to join me this 
evening in voting to confirm Judge 
John Chun for a Federal district court 
judgeship in the Western District of 
Washington State. 
Judge Chun is a Pacific Northwest 
native. He is a father. He is the son of 
South Korean immigrants. He would be 
the first Asian-American man to serve 
on Washington State’s Federal bench. 
He is patient and thoughtful, some-
one the people of Washington State can 
really count on to faithfully uphold the 
rule of law and treat litigants and all 
parties before him with grace and re-
spect. Judge Chun’s qualifications are 
superb, having served for 7 years now 
as a State court judge. His tempera-
ment and record of service demonstrate 
a real commitment to fairness and im-
partiality, whether through his service 
as a board member for the Washington 
Low Income Housing Alliance or his 
many pro bono commitments over the 
course of a very long career as both an 
attorney and a judge. 
For all these reasons and more, 
Judge Chun’s service as Federal dis-
trict court judge in my home State of 
Washington would surely help rebuild 
faith in our judicial system. I respect-
fully am here today to urge my col-
leagues to confirm Judge Chun. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 493 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
come today to the floor with a very 
simple unanimous consent request. 
This is a resolution. It doesn’t allo-
cate any dollars, doesn’t change any 
policy. It is just a statement of belief 
from the U.S. Senate. It is a statement 
to be able to say we hold certain things 
very important. 
I will talk through some of the reso-
lution part of it—the resolve at the be-
ginning of it—but it ends with a very 
simple statement. It ends with: 
Resolved, That the Senate—(1) recognizes 
and promotes the importance of parental in-
volvement in their child’s education; and (2) 
recognizes the necessity of school choices as 
a tool to empower all parents with the free-
dom to choose the best educational environ-
ment for their children and to reject destruc-
tive ideologies promoted by many public 
schools, such as Critical Race Theory. 
This comes from a basic conversation 
that happens in my State and, quite 
frankly, in States all around the coun-
try. Parents should be the primary de-
cision-makers for their children—not 
only where they are educated so that 
they don’t live in a certain neighbor-
hood and they say, I am sorry, you live 
there so you have to go here. 
This is so the parents have the max-
imum amount of flexibility knowing 
one child may be a great fit for one 
school, and the younger child may be a 
better fit for a different school, wheth-
er that be a public school that allows 
flexibility within a district to be able 
to move place to place or, as it happens 
in my State, where you can even 
change district to district within pub-
lic schools. 
If a parent maybe works in one 
area—one school district—but lives in 
another, that parent can choose to be 
able to have their child go into a dif-
ferent district. Though it is a public 
school setting, it gives them the flexi-
bility and the choice to do that. Why? 
Because not every kid is the same and 
not every educational environment is 
the same. 
I would say in my State—and I would 
assume in other States as well—not 
every school district is the same. It is 
important to us in our State that every 
school district is successful. There is 
no place that we don’t want any child 
to be able to be successful. 
But we should all admit the facts: 
Not every school district is thriving. 
As we invest dollars and time and en-
courage great teaching in that district, 
that child who is in that district that 
is not being successful is trapped in a 
location that is currently not success-
ful. Maybe they can be successful in 5 
years 
from 
now 
when 
they 
work 
through the different issues they have, 
but that child doesn’t have a second 
shot. 
If that child has no other opportunity 
to be able to choose and their parents 
are locked into that spot, we basically 
say, We will fix everything in this dis-
trict in a few years, and that child is 
just not allowed to get an option out. I 
don’t think that is helpful for that 
child and that parent at that time. 
Giving parents the ability to be able 
to 
make 
choices—whether 
public 
schools, 
charter 
schools, 
private 
schools—whatever may work best for 
their school and for their State and the 
policies their State has created seems 
like a smart thing to be able to do. 
Any kind of teaching that is within a 
school that actually promotes one kid 
as the oppressor and the other kid as 
the oppressed simply because of the 
color of their skin should not be taught 
in our schools. Why don’t we teach 
every child is equal? Why don’t we 
teach every child should have oppor-
tunity? Why don’t we teach every fam-
ily has the opportunity in this great 
country of ours; and where we have 
weaknesses, we work on our weak-
nesses? But we don’t label a child as an 
oppressor or as oppressed based on the 
color of their skin—at least we used to 
not in America. 
But that is what is rising up with 
this critical race theory as it rises up 
from place to place. I have had many of 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
saying: That is not true. That is not 
being taught. 
Great. Let’s make the resolution. 
Let’s say that we as a Senate don’t be-
lieve that this should be taught. Let’s 
teach every child. Let’s love every 
child. 
This 
resolution 
also 
affirms 
the 
rights of parents to be able to speak 
out—not in a violent way, not in a de-
structive way, but for parents to be 
able to speak out. 
Why is it that several months ago, 
the Department of Justice in our Na-
tion starts a whole investigation on 
parents to be able to say: Are there 
parents who are actually maybe closet 
terrorists who are showing up at school 
board meetings, complaining about 
what is being taught, complaining 
about a mask mandate in their school, 
complaining about a vaccine mandate, 
complaining about critical race theory, 
or just saying ‘‘I don’t like this par-
ticular curriculum’’? 
That used to be the rights of parents, 
to engage, and now we hear: Really, 
parents don’t know enough about these 
difficult things. Parents need to just 
sit down over there. We will take care 
of this as professionals. 
So, again, this resolution doesn’t add 
additional funding. It doesn’t change 
the structure of our schools. But it 
does say: We as the Senate believe in 
the power of the parent to be able to 
make the right choice for their chil-
dren. 
So, with that, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions be discharged 
from further consideration and the 
Senate now proceed to my resolution, 
S. Res. 493. I further ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be agreed 
to, the preamble be agreed to, and that 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I got my 
start in national politics as a parent 
advocating for my kids’ preschool pro-
gram. I am a former preschool teacher. 
I am a former school board member. I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1215 
March 16, 2022 
am now chair of the Senate Education 
Committee. I have worked across the 
aisle on fixing No Child Left Behind. I 
have also fought against efforts—many 
during the former administration with 
Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Edu-
cation—because I felt they took us fur-
ther from the goal of making sure that 
every student in our country, no mat-
ter who they are or where they live or 
how much money their parents make, 
can get an excellent public education 
and all the opportunity that comes 
with it. 
All this is to say that I could not 
care more deeply about making sure 
every child gets the chance to learn 
and succeed in life, and my belief that 
parents should be as involved as pos-
sible in their kids’ education could not 
be more firmly or personally held. In 
fact, I can remember the times when, 
as a U.S. Senator with young kids at 
home myself, I would try to read all 
my memos at night and help with their 
homework. I wanted my own kids to 
have that support from me, just like I 
want every parent to be able to be on 
top of what is going on in their kids’ 
school. 
I also know from talking to my own 
family and so many students and fami-
lies across Washington State that 
these last two years have been some of 
the 
toughest, 
most 
overwhelming 
times for parents and kids that many 
of us can remember. 
Here in the Senate, our job is to rec-
ognize that and do everything we can 
to get things back on track, which is 
why Democrats acted quickly to pass 
the American Rescue Plan and give 
schools the resources they need so they 
could reopen and stay open safely. 
We also recognized that after 2 really 
disruptive years, many students would 
need extra help, so the American Res-
cue Plan is, as we speak right now, 
paying for afterschool programs and 
tutors and summer learning so stu-
dents all across the country can catch 
up. 
I will remind you that this bill to 
help reopen schools safely and keep 
them open passed with zero Republican 
votes—not one. Not only that, Senate 
Republicans have come to the floor 
twice last month alone with ideas 
about snatching Federal funding away 
from our schools, and Republican lead-
ers even rolled out a plan that would 
eliminate the Department of Education 
altogether. Could there be a clearer 
message about their priorities? 
At all times but especially after the 
last 2 years, there is no excuse for any-
thing short of an all-hands-on-deck na-
tional effort to put students’ education 
first, but, unfortunately, here is what 
we have got happening: Democrats 
acted to reopen our schools safely and 
keep them open. Congressional Repub-
licans, down to the last one, voted no. 
Democrats believe that quality pub-
lic education for every student is a 
good 
investment. 
The 
Republican 
Party keeps putting forward ideas to 
gut public education. Democrats want 
to lower student debt and the cost of 
tuition. Republicans are virtually no-
where to be seen on those issues. 
Democrats want students to learn. Re-
publican legislatures across the coun-
try want to ban books. 
To sum it up, Democrats want every 
student to have the ability to get a 
great education. We are focused on 
that. We are serious about it, and we 
are working on it. Meanwhile, Repub-
licans at all levels—and the resolution 
we are debating today is a case in 
point—want to use students and par-
ents and schools as political pawns 
rather than focusing on making sure 
every single student in our country can 
get a high-quality education and be 
able to succeed. 
In fact, I just spoke this afternoon 
with trans kids and parents about what 
is going on in Texas and other parts of 
the country. These kids are brave, but 
they are scared. Their parents are wor-
ried about being investigated by the 
State just because a politician has de-
cided he doesn’t like how they are rais-
ing their kids. 
How are kids supposed to focus on 
learning when their safety is in ques-
tion? How are their friends supposed to 
focus on learning when their class-
mates are dealing with something like 
this? Why are parents having to worry 
about whether they will get inves-
tigated for raising their kids according 
to their beliefs, their doctor’s advice, 
and their kids’ needs? 
When and if Senate Republicans are 
truly serious about focusing on getting 
American students the great education 
they need and deserve, we will know 
because Republicans and Democrats 
might be able to come together again 
and put students and parents and 
schools first. I know that is possible 
because I have worked with Repub-
licans to make this happen. 
So today I would like to give my col-
league an opportunity to take the first 
step in the right direction. In a mo-
ment, I will ask consent to pass a bill 
that would help our students. 
If we agree we want parents involved 
in their kids’ education and if we agree 
that this is a moment when students, 
like so many Americans, are stressed 
and need us to have their backs, which 
I really hope we do, then let’s send 
more counselors and nurses to our Na-
tion’s schools. Let’s prioritize STEM 
education and advanced coursework 
and make them available to more of 
our K–12 students. Let’s make stu-
dents’ mental health a top priority so 
they can focus on learning. 
So I will be asking unanimous con-
sent on legislation that would help us 
all do this—importantly, in a way that 
seeks parents’ input directly on what 
will matter most to their kids and 
their communities. 
If you are trying to get our schools 
back on track, this should be an easy 
yes vote because it will be a vote for 
students’ education, parents’ peace of 
mind, and actually doing something 
real about the tough challenges stu-
dents and parents are facing. 
I hope my friend from Oklahoma will 
support it and that moving forward, 
Republicans will take education as se-
riously as they claim to and reverse 
course and join us in working to meet 
this moment for students’ and parents’ 
sake. 
At this time, I object to the Senator 
from Oklahoma’s unanimous consent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mrs. MURRAY. As if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of the Murray bill, which 
is at the desk, a bill to appropriate 
funds for students’ academic and men-
tal health needs. Further, I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I appreciate 
the dialogue on education. A degree is 
an education. My mom is a lifelong ed-
ucator. I spent my summers growing 
up in the school library, putting books 
in the Dewey Decimal System, putting 
the new piece of tape on the outside of 
it, and actually, back in the old days, 
filing a new card in the card catalog, 
which half the people listening to me 
right now have no idea what that is. 
I am passionate about education. I 
have two daughters, and I stay very en-
gaged in the issue of education. So it is 
always interesting to me when my 
Democratic colleagues say: When Re-
publicans get serious about education. 
It is always interesting. We will pass 
a bill, like what happened in the omni-
bus or what happened in any Education 
bill before, and there will be billions 
and billions of dollars in education, but 
the comment will always be ‘‘Well, if 
you really loved kids, you would do 
just $1 billion more, but because you 
don’t love kids, you did $1 billion less.’’ 
It is never enough on it. 
This resolution that I brought today 
was not about an extra $1.3 billion in 
education to be able to hire more peo-
ple; it was just about empowering par-
ents. 
It is an interesting side by side to say 
what families need more is more em-
ployees at school, and what I am seeing 
is that we need more empowerment of 
parents. 
One costs $1.3 billion; the other one is 
just free. One says: Let’s have folks at 
school know how to be able to take 
care of your kids best. The other one 
says: Well, let’s make sure there are 
certain things, like critical race the-
ory, that we don’t teach at school to 
make sure every child is taught the 
same. And if that parent wants to 
teach that at home, they are welcome 
to teach that at home, but let’s not im-
pose that on every child. Let’s not call 
some children oppressors because of 
the color of their skin. 
Why don’t we do that?

S1216 
March 16, 2022 
So the resolution I brought is not 
about a billion dollars; it is just a 
statement of support of parents, a 
statement of support of what parents 
want to be able to teach. It is not 
about more school employees; it is 
about stronger parents. That is what I 
think that we ought to continue to be 
able to address. 
This is not about who loves edu-
cation more. Quite frankly, I know my 
colleague from Washington is pas-
sionate about kids and about edu-
cation. She has lived it as a mom, as a 
leader in the Senate, and as someone I 
watched negotiate with Lamar Alex-
ander some of the toughest education 
policy conversations. She is a remark-
able legislator and is passionate about 
this. 
We have some disagreements on some 
of these issues. I am just passionate 
about doing whatever we can to be able 
to honor parents as often as we can and 
to tell them: No, you are not going to 
be investigated. 
She mentioned parents in Texas 
being worried about being investigated. 
I will tell you, parents in Oklahoma 
have said to me: I no longer go to 
school board meetings because I am 
afraid the FBI is going to be there and 
they are going to open a case on me. I 
have heard that the Attorney General 
is looking for parents who are problems 
across the country, and so I don’t feel 
comfortable going to a school board 
meeting anymore because the U.S. At-
torney General may open a file on me. 
Now, that is a real conversation with 
a parent at home. 
So let’s find a way to be able to em-
power parents and do whatever we can. 
So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. First, I would ask con-
sent that I be able to complete my 
brief remarks before the vote starts. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JULIE REBECCA RUBIN 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the confirmation of 
Baltimore City Circuit Court Judge 
Julie Rubin to be a U.S. district judge 
for the District of Maryland. I rec-
ommended Judge Rubin, along with 
Senator VAN
HOLLEN, to President 
Biden, and we strongly support her 
nomination. 
Judge Rubin has been nominated to 
fill the vacancy created when Judge 
Ellen Hollander, appointed by Presi-
dent Obama in 2011, announced her in-
tentions to take senior status. 
President Biden nominated Judge 
Rubin for this position on December 3 
of last year, and the Judiciary Com-
mittee held her confirmation hearing 
on December 15. Judge Rubin was fa-
vorably reported by the Judiciary Com-
mittee on January 20 of this year by a 
bipartisan vote. 
She received a unanimous ‘‘well 
qualified’’ rating from the American 
Bar Association Standing Committee 
on the Federal Judiciary, which is the 
organization’s highest rating. The ABA 
assesses the nominee’s professional 
competency, integrity, and judicial 
temperament. 
Shortly after the November 2020 
Presidential elections, I worked with 
Senator VAN HOLLEN to establish the 
judicial selection committee in Mary-
land. We used an open application proc-
ess with public advertisement and com-
municated closely with State, local, 
and specialty bar associations in Mary-
land. In particular, we sought out high-
ly qualified and diverse applicants. Our 
committee interviewed everyone who 
submitted an application, which in-
volved several dozen interviews. Sen-
ator VAN
HOLLEN
and I personally 
interviewed several finalists before rec-
ommending names to the White House. 
Born in Baltimore, Judge Rubin re-
ceived her B.A. cum laude from Mount 
Holyoke College in 1995 and her J.D. 
from 
the 
University 
of 
Maryland 
School of Law in 1998. 
She worked at Astrachan Gunst, han-
dling intellectual property and employ-
ment law matters in both Federal and 
State court. 
Judge Rubin was appointed by the 
Governor of Maryland in 2012 as a Bal-
timore City circuit judge and was 
elected in 2014 by the people of Balti-
more to a 15-year term. 
The circuit court is the State trial 
court of general jurisdiction in Mary-
land, covering both civil and criminal 
cases, and is the exclusive court for 
jury trials, including felony trials— 
similar jurisdiction to what the Fed-
eral district court handles. So she has 
that experience. 
Judge Rubin brings tremendous expe-
rience to the courtroom as a sitting 
Baltimore City circuit judge for nearly 
a decade. She has handled a substantial 
and diverse caseload in our State court 
in Baltimore, having served in the 
civil, family, criminal, and general 
trial divisions, as well as serving on 
special assignments to the asbestos 
docket. She previously served as a su-
pervisory judge of alternative dispute 
resolutions. She estimates that she has 
presided over about 1,000 criminal and 
civil cases that have gone to verdict or 
judgment, including both bench and 
jury trials. 
Judge Rubin is known as a judge’s 
judge, in terms of her excellent tem-
perament, work ethic, and congeniality 
with lawyers and litigants. She is 
known to be fair in judgment to all 
litigants. She was selected to serve as 
a faculty member of the Judicial Col-
lege and tasked with instructing newly 
appointed Maryland trial judges on ju-
dicial ethics and best courtroom prac-
tices. 
Judge Rubin has continued to give 
back to the community as an adjunct 
legal professor at the Maryland Law 
School. She cochaired the Bench Bar 
Committee of the Bar Association of 
Baltimore City, served on the board of 
the Baltimore Metropolitan Chapter of 
the Simon E. Sobeloff Law Society, 
and assisted the CollegeBound Founda-
tion and the Baltimore Education 
Scholarship Trust to help underprivi-
leged or at-risk youth. She has served 
as chair of the board of trustees for the 
Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore. She 
has given back to our community and 
understands the challenges in our com-
munity. 
As a fellow graduate of the Univer-
sity of Maryland Francis King Carey 
Law School, I am confident that Judge 
Rubin will meet the highest standards 
of integrity, competence, and tempera-
ment. I know she will uphold the rule 
of law for all Marylanders for this life-
time appointment. 
Finally, let me say that I know that 
public service is a sacrifice, not only 
for the nominee but for their family. 
So I want to thank Judge Rubin’s hus-
band James and her entire family for 
sharing Judge Rubin with the people of 
Maryland. 
Judge 
Rubin’s 
confirmation 
will 
build on the quality and diversity of 
the Maryland District Court bench. All 
10 of the confirmed judges have been 
recommended by me to the President 
for appointment as a Senator from 
Maryland. I am proud of their quali-
fications and diversity. 
In Maryland, our Federal bench is 50 
percent women, 50 percent men, 40 per-
cent people of color. We appointed the 
first African-American woman, 
the 
first person of Palestinian descent. We 
have a diversified, quality bench rep-
resenting the people of Maryland and 
providing the justice the people of 
Maryland deserve. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor 
of the confirmation of Judge Julie 
Rubin to be a U.S. district judge for 
the District of Maryland. 
I yield the floor.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session for a pe-
riod of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CONFIRMATION OF SHALANDA D. 
YOUNG 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I 
am pleased to acknowledge the con-
firmation of Shalanda Young to be the 
Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget with a bipartisan vote of 61 
to 36. 
Director Young has a depth of experi-
ence that cannot be matched to lead 
the Office of Management and Budget. 
A staff member on the House Appro-
priations Committee for 15 years—serv-
ing 4 of these years as the committee’s 
staff 
director—Director 
Young 
has 
years of experience in crafting the 
budgets of the Federal agencies that 
the American people rely on. 
In 2019, Director Young was one of 
the few staff present in the room while 
then Chairman SHELBY, Chairwoman 
Lowey, Ranking Member GRANGER, and 
I negotiated the end to the longest 
Federal Government shutdown in U.S. 
history. Her knowledge of Federal pro-
grams, understanding of the political 
process, and years of critical insight 
into the operations of the federal gov-
ernment were invaluable in our nego-
tiations to reach a deal. 
I was glad to strongly support Direc-
tor Young’s nomination to be Deputy 
Director of OMB. After she was con-
firmed to that position, she began to 
serve as its Acting Director. It was in 
this role that she guided the Biden ad-
ministration’s 
budget 
priorities 
through the COVID pandemic, dev-
astating 
natural 
disasters, 
a 
long 
sought after bipartisan infrastructure 
law, and now the response to President 
Putin’s 
unprovoked 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine. 
As if she did not have enough on her 
plate, on October 31, 2021, she gave 
birth to a beautiful baby girl, Charlie. 
If juggling all of that did not prove she 
is more than qualified for the job, I am 
not sure what would. 
As the chairman of the Senate Ap-
propriations Committee, I look forward 
to working with her and her team at 
OMB on the fiscal year 2023 appropria-
tions process. Director Young under-
stands how to work across the aisle to 
get a deal done. I cannot think of 
someone I would rather work with in 
putting the appropriations process to 
work on behalf of the American people. 
f 
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE 
SENATE NATO OBSERVED GROUP 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in 
2018, we reestablished the Senate NATO 
Observer Group. I ask for the following 
Republican Senators to participate in 
the group: TILLIS (cochair), BARRASSO, 
ERNST, ROUNDS, RUBIO, and HAGERTY. 
f 
EB–5 REGIONAL CENTER PROGRAM 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have 
long been a supporter of the EB–5 pro-
gram, which has been a significant eco-
nomic driver in Texas. This merit- 
based immigration program has cre-
ated thousands of American jobs and 
brought billions of dollars in invest-
ment to urban and rural areas across 
Texas and the U.S. 
While it was unfortunate that the au-
thorization for the EB–5 Regional Cen-
ter program was allowed to lapse on 
June 30, 2021, I am pleased to have 
worked with my colleagues, Senators 
CHUCK GRASSLEY and PATRICK LEAHY, 
on the EB–5 Reform and Integrity Act, 
which was included as part of the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2022. 
The EB–5 Reform and Integrity Act 
reauthorizes the regional center pro-
gram through September 30, 2027, and 
implements meaningful reforms and in-
tegrity measures that will ensure the 
viability and security of the program 
for the coming years. 
This legislation provides the first 
multiyear authorization for the re-
gional center program since 2015, so 
that regional centers, which have been 
in limbo for nearly 9 months, will have 
much-needed stability going forward. 
There is also a 60-day implementation 
period to allow USCIS to begin proc-
essing EB–5 petitions and applications 
that have been on hold since the lapse. 
Following that initial period, existing 
regional centers will be able to imme-
diately get back to work driving in-
vestment into the U.S. and facilitating 
the creation of jobs across the country. 
f 
ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, sec-
tion 36(b) of the Arms Export Control 
Act requires that Congress receive 
prior notification of certain proposed 
arms sales as defined by that statute. 
Upon such notification, the Congress 
has 30 calendar days during which the 
sale may be reviewed. The provision 
stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent 
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

pability to meet current and future threats.

provide the capability to perform anti-sur-
face and anti-submarine warfare missions 
along with the ability to perform secondary 
missions including vertical replenishment, 
search and rescue, and communications 
relay and will bolster the Spanish Navy’s 
ability to support NATO and remain inter-
operable with the U.S. and the NATO alli-
ance. Spain will have no difficulty absorbing 
these helicopters into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin Rotary and Mission Systems, Owego, 
NY. There are no known offset agreements 
proposed in connection with this potential 
sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale may 
require the assignment of two (2) contractor 
representatives to Spain. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The MH–60R Multi-Mission Helicopter 
focuses primarily on anti-submarine and 
anti-surface warfare missions. The MH–60R 
carries several sensors and data links to en-
hance its ability to work in a network cen-
tric battle group and as an extension of its 
home ship/main operating base. The mission 
equipment subsystem consists of the fol-
lowing sensors and subsystems: an acoustics 
systems consisting of a dipping sonar and 
sonobuoys, Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) with 
integral Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) 
interrogator, Radios with COMSEC, Elec-
tronic Support Measures (ESM), Integrated 
Self-Defense (ISD), and Multi-Spectral Tar-
geting System (MTS). The aircraft processes 
sensor data onboard, and transmits data via 
Common Data Link (CDL) (also referred to 
as Hawklink). The aircraft is night vision 
compatible. It can carry AGM–114A/B/K/N 
Hellfire missiles to engage surface and sub- 
surface targets. 
a. The AGM–114 Hellfire missile is an air- 
to-surface missile with a multi-mission, 
multi-target, precision strike capability. 
The Hellfire can be launched from multiple 
air platforms and is the primary precision 
weapon for the United States Army. 
b. Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System 
(APKWS) laser guided rocket to counter the 
fast attack craft and fast inshore attack 
craft threat. 
c. Communications security (COMSEC) de-
vices contain sensitive encryption algo-
rithms and keying material. 
d. Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) (KIV– 
78) contains embedded security devices con-
taining sensitive encryption algorithms and 
keying material. 
e. GPS/PPS/SAASM—Global Positioning 
System (GPS) provides a space-based Global 
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that 
has reliable location and time information in 
all weather and at all times and anywhere on 
or near the earth when and where there is an 
unobstructed line of sight to four or more 
GPS satellites. Selective Availability/Anti- 
Spoofing Module (SAASM) (AN/PSN–11) is 
used by military GPS receivers to allow 
decryption of precision GPS coordinates. In 
addition, the GPS Antenna System (GAS–1) 
provides protection from enemy manipula-
tion of the GPS system. 
f. Acoustics algorithms are used to process 
dipping sonar and sonobuoy data for target 
tracking and for the Acoustics Mission Plan-
ner (AMP), which is a tactical aid employed

to optimize the deployment of sonobuoys and 
the dipping sonar. 
g. The AN/APS–153 multi-mode radar with 
an integrated IFF and Inverse Synthetic Ap-
erture (ISAR) provides target surveillance/ 
detection capability. 
h. The AN/ALQ–210 (ESM) system identi-
fies the location of an emitter. 
i. The AN/AAS–44C(V) Multi-Spectral Tar-
geting System (MTS) operates in day/night 
and adverse weather conditions. Imagery is 
provided by a Forward Looking Infrared 
(FLIR) sensor, a color/monochrome day tele-
vision (DTV) camera, and a Low-Light TV 
(LLTV). 
j. Ultra High Frequency/Very High Fre-
quency (UHF/VHF) Radios (ARC–210) contain 
embedded sensitive encryption algorithms 
and keying material. 
k. Advanced Data Transfer System (ADTS) 
with Type 1 encryption for data at rest. 
l. Satellite Communications Demand As-
signed Multiple Access (SATCOM DAMA), 
which provides increased, interoperable com-
munications capabilities with U.S. forces. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems, which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Spain can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Spain.

UKRAINE 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise to bring attention to the need to 
support the Ukrainian people in the 
face of Russia’s invasion. Over the 
weekend, I took part in a Senate dele-
gation to Poland alongside my col-
leagues Senator ROB PORTMAN, Senator 
RICHARD
BLUMENTHAL, and Senator 
ROGER WICKER. We met with Ukrainian 
refugees—women, 
children, 
grand-
parents—some who were carrying their 
whole lives on their backs. 
Three weeks ago, Ukrainians were 
thinking about their jobs, their plans, 
and their dreams. Now, so much of that 
is in shambles. Women have been fig-
uring out how to get their older par-
ents and young children to safety 
across the border while their brothers 
and husbands take up arms. The most 
heartbreaking conversations I had were 
with children who didn’t know if they 
had a future. 
Seeing the cost of this invasion up 
close has only strengthened my resolve 
to stand with Ukraine, both with hu-
manitarian aid for refugees and mili-
tary support. With advanced weapons 
from the United States and allies, 
Ukraine’s Territorial Defense has been 
more effective in stifling Russia’s inva-
sion than most imagined. Vladimir 
Putin thought he would be greeted 
with rose petals—instead it was Molo-
tov cocktails. And 21 days later, Kyiv 
still stands. 
I was proud to join the bipartisan 
Senate majority in allocating $13.6 bil-
lion for aid to Ukraine, but more sup-
port is needed. Over the past few 
weeks, Russian aircraft have been be-
hind brutal assaults on residential 
neighborhoods, religious institutions, 
and hospitals in Ukraine. Ukraine 
needs more air defense support. Drones, 
Stingers, and Javelins have proven to 
be highly effective in taking down Rus-
sian aircraft and tanks, so we must 
continue to provide that critical weap-
onry and more. 
In the face of this devastation, Po-
land has shown that it is a country 
with a big heart, taking in more than 
1.7 million Ukrainian refugees. For per-
spective, Poland is a country of 38 mil-
lion. Since they have opened their 
doors, the country’s population has 
grown by over 4 percent. In Warsaw 
alone, the population has increased by 
11 percent. Poles are meeting refugees 
at the border and welcoming them into 
their communities—even into their 
own homes. 
The Polish people don’t have to 
imagine what it is like to live through 
a full-scale invasion. Their history is 
marked by invasions by Prussia, the 
Habsburgs, the Nazis, and yes, Russia. 
Poland is also well aware of its 332-mile 
border with Ukraine. Last week, Rus-
sian missiles struck 15 miles from Po-
land’s border. The Polish border guards 
I spoke with said they could literally 
feel the earth shake. As Putin’s war 
inches westward, we must affirm our 
commitment to our NATO ally from a 
military and humanitarian standpoint. 
During our trip, Senator PORTMAN, 
Senator BLUMENTHAL, Senator WICKER, 
and I had the honor of meeting with 
the 82nd Airborne. They briefed us on 
everything that is being done to help 
Ukrainian refugees, as well as fighters 
on the front lines. I also met with Min-
nesota troops, and I was inspired by 
their character and determination. It 
was clear that they understood the pa-
triotic value of their service. I pray for 
their safety as they continue their mis-
sion in the region. 
Across the Atlantic in Ukraine, we 
are all seeing how precious democracy 
truly is. Putin has shown his true col-
ors. But you know what else? The peo-
ple of Ukraine have shown their true 
colors—in bright blue and yellow—they 
are showing the world what true cour-
age is all about. We must continue to 
stand with them in their fight. 
f 
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF KING 
SOOPERS SHOOTING 
Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, on 
March 22, 2021, we suffered another hor-
rific mass shooting in our State at the 
King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, 
CO. As we approach its 1-year anniver-
sary, we honor the 10 Coloradans whose 
lives were cut tragically short in this 
senseless act of gun violence. They 
leave behind children, spouses, parents, 
friends, and a Boulder community that 
will always carry the grief of their loss. 
They will never forget the 10 victims 
and neither should America. So today, 
we read their names into the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD. 
Denny Stong was 20 years old and a 
graduate of Fairview High School. He 
was an introverted, smart kid who 
loved history and model airplanes. He 
had been covering shifts at the King 
Soopers and took enormous pride in his 
role as an essential worker during the 
pandemic. He once posted on Facebook: 
‘‘I can’t stay home . . . I am a grocery 
store worker.’’ 
Neven Stanisic was 23 years old. His 
dad said he was ‘‘a really good boy, a 
good kid . . . a hard-working boy.’’ His 
parents are refugees from Bosnia who 
left in the 1990s to escape the war. The 
reverend at their local church said, 
‘‘His family fled the war . . . They left 
everything to save their lives, and 
came here to have a new start.’’ 
Rikki Olds was 25 years old. She had 
been working as a manager at King 
Soopers for 6 years. Her family de-
scribed her as a ‘‘firecracker’’ who lit 
up a room with her infectious giggle. 
Her aunt Lori said, ‘‘She had a beau-
tiful way of just being her . . . When 
you’re down, she just wanted to cheer 
you up, just by being around.’’ 
Tralona Bartkowiak was 49 years old. 
She co-owned a clothing and acces-
sories store with her sister and was a

frequent presence in the Boulder arts 
and music scene. She had a deep curi-
osity about the world that took her on 
travels from Nepal to Costa Rica. Her 
younger brother remembers her as ‘‘a 
beam of light.’’ 
Teri Leiker was 51 years old. She was 
a huge fan of the Buffaloes at CU and 
was a regular face at the Pearl Street 
Stampede. A friend called Teri ‘‘the 
most selfless, innocent, amazing person 
I have had the honor of meeting.’’ 
Suzanne Fountain was 59 years old. 
She worked for 15 years at Boulder 
Community Health. She loved gar-
dening and was passionate about music 
and theater. A friend described her as 
‘‘the cream of the crop and a good per-
son, a good soul.’’ 
Kevin Mahoney was 61 years old. He 
had worked in the hotel business but 
retired early to spend more time trav-
eling, skiing, and visiting his daughter, 
Erika. After learning of her father’s 
death, Erika wrote, ‘‘My dad represents 
all things Love. I’m so thankful he 
could walk me down the aisle last sum-
mer.’’ 
Lynn Murray was 62 years old, a 
mother of two, and a retired photo di-
rector for prominent national maga-
zines. Her husband John said, ‘‘I just 
want her to be remembered as this 
amazing, amazing comet spending 62 
years flying across the sky.’’ 
Jody Waters was 65 years old. She 
used to own a boutique clothing store 
named Applause on the Pearl Street 
Mall, where she remembered all her 
customers and their favorite brands. 
She was a mother of two and a grand-
mother who loved horses and hiking. A 
friend said when Jody walked into the 
room, ‘‘She was a breath of fresh air, a 
light.’’ 
Finally, we honor Officer Eric Talley. 
He was 51 years old, a man of deep 
faith, and a devoted father of seven. 
After losing a close friend to a DUI, he 
joined the police academy at age 40 to 
give back to the community. In 2013, he 
made headlines when he helped rescue 
11 ducklings from a drainage ditch. 
Eric’s father said he ‘‘loved his kids 
and family more than anything.’’ For 
their sake, he was hoping to stay off 
the frontlines by learning to become a 
drone operator. But when the bullets 
rang out, he rushed into action, saving 
countless lives at the cost of his own. 
Colorado owes Officer Talley a debt we 
will never be able to repay. He and the 
nine other victims represent the best of 
our State. 
As we honor the victims’ lives, we 
stand with all who continue to grieve 
and the community as it continues to 
heal. We condemn the senseless gun vi-
olence, not only in Boulder last year, 
but in far too many American cities 
and towns every day. Until no Amer-
ican has to live in reasonable fear of 
being gunned down in a school, or a 
movie theater, or a grocery store, we 
have more work to do.

PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE ON ENDING THE ACCESS 
OF RUSSIAN FINANCIAL INSTI-

Mrs. BLACKBURN (for herself and

lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs: 
S. RES. 548 
Whereas providers of specialized financial 
messaging services are a critical link to the 
international financial system; 
Whereas the European Union, Japan, Can-
ada, and other partners of the United States 
are to be commended for strengthening the 
multilateral sanctions regime against the 
Russian Federation; 
Whereas, while the expulsion of selected 
Russian financial institutions from special-
ized financial messaging services is a first 
step, that expulsion alone is not sufficient to 
address the scope and scale at which the 
Government of the Russian Federation is 
waging war against Ukraine; and 
Whereas, once achieved, the complete loss 
of access by Russian financial institutions to 
specialized 
financial 
messaging 
services 
must be maintained: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) the Senate urges the President, in the 
strongest possible terms, to immediately 
take all measures necessary to remove all 
Russian financial institutions from access to 
specialized financial messaging services, in-
cluding by working with allies and partners

PORTING 
THE 
TRANSFER 
OF 
AIRCRAFT 
AND 
AIR 
DEFENSE 
SYSTEMS 
TO 
THE 
ARMED 
FORCES OF UKRAINE 
Mr.

(for 
himself, 
Ms. 
ERNST, Mr. CRAPO, Mr. CRAMER, Mr. 
CASSIDY, Mr. SCOTT
of Florida, Mr. 
WICKER, Mr. ROMNEY, Mr. TILLIS, and 
Mr. LANKFORD) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 549 
Whereas the people of Ukraine have shown 
great resolve in combating the blind aggres-
sion of the Russian Federation following the 
further invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 
2022; 
Whereas the Armed Forces of the Russian 
Federation continue to assault the people of 
Ukraine through indiscriminate aerial at-
tacks; 
Whereas the United States Department of 
Defense has stated that the Russian Federa-
tion flies ‘‘on average 200 sorties per day’’ in 
their campaign against Ukraine; 
Whereas Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
Zelensky has continued to request that 
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Orga-
nization and other countries around the 
globe support the transfer of military air-
craft and air defense systems to the Armed 
Forces of Ukraine in order to protect the 
people of Ukraine; 
Whereas the MiG–29 is the main fixed-wing 
aircraft in the inventory of the Ukrainian 
Air Force, and it is critical that the Ukrain-
ian Air Force receive aircraft that mirror 
the capability and operating standard of the 
MiG–29; 
Whereas additional MiG–29s are essential 
for the Ukrainian Air Force to remain capa-
ble of contesting aircraft of the Russian Fed-
eration; 
Whereas, on March 5, 2022, it was reported 
that the Government of Poland would trans-
fer MiG–29s to Ukraine in exchange for air-
craft from the United States; 
Whereas, on March 6, 2022, Secretary of 
State Antony Blinken stated that the trans-
fer of Polish MiG–29s to Ukraine ‘‘gets a 
green light [and that] we’re talking with our 
Polish friends right now about what we 
might be able to do to backfill their 
needs. . .’’; 
Whereas, on March 8, 2022, the Government 
of Poland stated that Poland would ‘‘de-
ploy—immediately and free of charge—all of 
their M[i]G–29 jets. . .and place them at the 
disposal of the Government of the United 
States’’ and further stated that ‘‘other 
NATO Allies—owners of M[i]G–29 jets— 
[should] act in the same vein’’; 
Whereas, on March 9, 2022, the Pentagon 
stated that the United States does ‘‘not sup-
port the transfer of additional fighter air-
craft to the Ukrainian Air Force at this 
time, and therefore have no desire to see 
them in our custody, either’’ and further 
stated that ‘‘the transfer of combat aircraft 
right now could be mistaken, by Mr. Putin 
and the Russians as an escalatory step’’; 
Whereas a failure to provide aircraft, such 
as MiG–29s, and air defense systems to the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine would embolden 
the Russian Federation and further endanger 
the people of Ukraine; 
Whereas the Biden Administration should 
support the transfer of aircraft, such as MiG– 
29s, and air defense systems, including Sting-
er missiles and more advanced surface-to-air 
missile systems, to Ukraine; and 
Whereas Congress urges the Biden Admin-
istration to meet the air defense needs re-
quested by President Zelensky, including the 
transfer of aircraft, such as MiG–29s, and 
other air defense systems: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) encourages the President of the United 
States to support the transfer of aircraft, 
such as MiG–29s, and air defense systems to 
Ukraine; 
(2) supports continued efforts by members 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
and other countries around the globe to iden-
tify additional aviation and air defense capa-
bilities to transfer to the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine; and 
(3) 
stands 
with 
Ukrainian 
President 
Volodymyr Zelensky and the people of 
Ukraine in their struggle against Russian 
aggression.

PRAYER OF PUTIN’S WAR 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, Rev. Dr. Derek W. H. Thomas, now 
an American citizen from Wales, United King-
dom, being the Senior Minister of the First 
Presbyterian Church of Columbia founded in 
1795 delivered a heartfelt prayer on February 
27th for the embattled people of Ukraine with 
love for the people of Russia. The prayer was 
authored by Rev. Steven D. Froehlich of New 
Life Presbyterian Church of Ithaca, NY. 
The ministry of Dr. Thomas is so meaningful 
to our family with six generations having at-
tended First Presbyterian Church of Columbia. 
Lord, destroy Putin the tyrant 
Lord, have mercy on Putin the man made in 
your image 
Lord, overwhelm the Russian soldiers with 
the guilt of the evil to which they are 
party 
Lord, show the Russian soldiers the forgive-
ness that can be theirs in Christ 
Lord, guide the weapons of Ukraine to de-
stroy the weapons of their enemy 
Lord, may the Russian missiles go astray 
and miss their targets 
Lord, as you have done before, send your an-
gels through the camp breathing chaos 
and destruction among the Russian 
army 
Lord, as you have done before, send your an-
gels to announce the promise of peace 
and life in Christ 
Lord, keep the Ukrainian people safe and the 
leaders alive, wise and courageous 
Lord, may the citizens of Russia flood the 
streets with protest against the evil of 
their leaders 
Lord, may the Russian fathers and mothers 
call to their children bearing arms to 
lay down their weapons 
Lord, may the United States and the nations 
of Europe be of one mind and resolve to 
stand against evil, even when it proves 
costly 
Lord, may peace return to the Ukraine and 
Russia 
Lord, as your children were vital to the col-
lapse of the Iron Curtain, may they 
once again be instruments of peace and 
justice 
Lord, may the Gospel be proclaimed in word 
and deed so that in war and in peace, in 
life and in death, in joy and in suf-
fering, Christ might be lifted up, loved 
and worshipped as the Prince of Peace. 
‘‘Do not let your hearts be troubled and do 
not be afraid . . . I have told you all 
this so you may have peace in me. Here 
on earth you will have many trials, but 
take heart, because I have overcome 
the world.’’ John 14:27, 16:33 
In Jesus’ name we pray, Amen.’’ 
IN RECOGNITION OF WEAVER HIGH 
SCHOOL WRESTLING STATE TITLE 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA

Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Weaver High 
School wrestling team for winning the AHSAA 
Class 1A/4A state title in dramatic fashion. 
On

thanks to pins by Devin Anderson and Joshua 
Johannson in the final two matches to secure 
their title win. The event was held at the Von 
Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama. 
Devin Anderson earned 1A–4A most valu-
able wrestler. This was head coach Andy 
Fulmer’s first state title and the Bearcats’ 10th 
state title. Their last state title was in 2004. 
Madam, Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Coach Fulmer, the wrestling team,

the 
fans.

JASON SLOWINSKI 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Golden, Colorado’s City 
Manager Jason Slowinski and wish him well 
as he transitions to a new role at the Colorado 
School of Mines. 
Since being appointed as City Manager in 
2015, Slowinski has led the city in several key 
initiatives, 
including 
critical 
infrastructure 
projects such as a new interchange at 6th Av-
enue and 19th Street, street upgrades on 
North Washington Avenue, and drainage im-
provements along Ford Street. Slowinski also 
played a critical role in the Heart of Golden 
planning initiative to revitalize the Clear Creek 
corridor—and all of this under strong and 
transparent budgetary practices. Throughout 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic, 
Slowinski 
has 
worked to ensure the City’s financial stability, 
the continuity of the City’s essential services, 
and support the community’s overall recovery. 
An effective and successful city manager re-
quires dependability, consistency, and dedica-
tion 
to 
the 
city’s 
residents. 
Throughout 
Slowinski’s career as City Manager he has 
maintained the best interest for the community 
of Golden and its people. I want to extent my 
deepest appreciation to Jason Slowinski for 
his contributions to the City of Golden and the 
State of Colorado. I wish him all the best in 
his future endeavors. 
RECOGNIZING FRISCO ASSISTANT 
POLICE CHIEF GREG WARD 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize Frisco Assistant Police Chief 
Greg Ward on his distinguished twenty-nine 
year career in law enforcement upon his well- 
deserved retirement. 
In 1985, Ward graduated from Southwest 
Texas State University with a degree in Crimi-
nal Justice. He would later go on to attend the 
FBI National Academy, the Senior Manage-
ment Institute for Police, and would obtain a 
State of Texas Master Peace Officer License. 
Since joining the Frisco Police Department 
in 1999, Chief Ward has supervised numerous 
departments including patrol, special oper-
ations, school resource officer programs, com-
munity services, and communications. Chief 
Ward was also responsible for the Investiga-
tions and Services Bureaus as well as the de-
partment’s firearms program. 
Given his extensive experience and active 
involvement, it comes as no surprise that in 
2019 Chief Ward was selected to serve as the 
interim Chief of Police for the City of Frisco 
following the departure of Chief John Bruce. 
A true public servant, he could often be 
found around Frisco engaging with residents 
and participating in events such as Safety 
Palooza, which sought to bring members of 
the community face to face with police and fire 
personnel. 
During his twenty-two years of service with 
the City of Frisco, Chief Ward’s versatile 
skillset made him a valuable asset to both the 
Department and the community. Due to his 
approachable nature and willingness to serve 
as a source of wisdom amongst his fellow offi-
cers, Chief Ward was highly regarded not only 
as a colleague, but also as a friend. 
Chief Greg Ward made a lasting impact on 
the Frisco community during a pivotal time in 
the city’s growth, and his absence will cer-
tainly be felt among many. Now upon his re-
tirement, I ask my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to join me in thanking Chief 
Greg Ward for his dedicated career in law en-
forcement and wish him the best as he pre-
pares to begin a new chapter of his life.

substance abuse issues. The organization was 
founded in 2010 by Chris Patton, Gary Smith, 
and Ben Embree. The Embassy officially 
opened their doors on January 8, 2011, to 
men in the community wanting to overcome 
their dependence on drugs. 
The mission of their ministry focuses on 
building a personal relationship with Jesus 
Christ and rebuilding a sense of self and con-
fidence for their residents to become leaders, 
whether that be in their work, community, 
church, or family. Along with spiritual develop-
ment, The Embassy provides occupational op-
portunities to ensure a comprehensive strat-
egy for treatment and recovery. These jobs 
help bring restoration and fulfillment through 
purposeful employment and development of 
life skills. 
I am proud of Executive Director Rick Rog-
ers, and all the mentors and volunteers that 
have transformed so many lives. Without their 
assistance, much of this would not have been 
possible. Their commitment and devotion to 
the transformation of these men have helped 
many Embassy residents become productive 
members of their community. I commend The 
Embassy’s efforts in providing such an 
impactful program to help the men in the Se-
dalia community strive to maintain a life of so-
briety. I look forward to seeing their continued 
work in supporting men in recovery for years 
to come.

HONORING JOHN BLEYL, ON THE 
OCCASION 
OF 
THE 
TWENTY- 
FIFTH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
HIS 
COMPANY, BLEYL ENGINEERING 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor the distinguished career and community 
contributions of my dear friend John Bleyl as 
we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of 
Bleyl Engineering. 
John founded Bleyl Engineering in 1997, 
after recognizing the need for high quality mu-
nicipal projects in Conroe, Texas. The incep-
tion of Bleyl Engineering helped jumpstart an 
era of record-setting growth in the Conroe 
community. 
However, John’s keen sense of entrepre-
neurship, strong Texas values, and reputation 
for faith-fueled business ethics grew the com-
pany from a boutique firm in Montgomery 
County to an engineering and construction 
management powerhouse with offices and 
community projects across the Lone Star 
State. The company now employs 100 people 
in Conroe, Austin, Bryan-College Station, and 
Tomball. 
Bleyl Engineering continues to be guided by 
its founding vision: ‘‘to be a foundation for the 
advancement of stronger, safer communities 
across Texas.’’ Under John’s leadership, not 
only has Bleyl Engineering prospered as a 
company, but many communities now have 
safer intersections, accessible public transpor-
tation, critical health care infrastructure, and 
economic growth opportunities. 
Mr. Bleyl’s first-class public and private sec-
tor engineering portfolio speaks for itself. A 
few notable engineering projects that highlight 
John’s legacy across Texas include the 
George Bush Intercontinental Airport, the 
Deison Technology Park, Texas Children’s 
Hospital, and the Fish Creek Thoroughfare Ex-
pansion. When the highest standard of engi-
neering or project management is required, 
Mr. Bleyl has been consistently called upon for 
his efficiency, dependability, and expertise. 
Bleyl Engineering has also been committed 
to supporting the community through various 
philanthropic causes. It contributes to local 
fundraisers through the Rotary Club of Conroe 
and the Magnolia Education Foundation. In 
addition, Bleyl Engineering sponsored a local 
Ironman Triathlon competitor to raise money 
for Syrian refugees displaced by the civil war. 
Mr. Bleyl continues to serve as the City En-
gineer for Panorama Village and Shenandoah, 
but his ideas live beyond his work as an engi-
neer. His dedication to his community is evi-
dent through his involvement in the Lazy River 
Improvement 
District 
Board, 
Lone 
Star 
Groundwater District Board, West Fork—TIRZ 
Board, Bryan—TIRZ Board, and the New 
Danville Project. 
I am proud to recognize John as an out-
standing member of the Conroe community 
and his business for celebrating a quarter-cen-
tury of excellence. Mr. Bleyl is an exceptional 
businessman, a generous philanthropist, and 
the embodiment of a true Texan. I congratu-
late him on this milestone and look forward to 
his continued sucess.

SAVE THE LIBERTY THEATRE ACT 
OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 3197, which provides a land 
conveyance to the city of Eunice, Louisiana. 
The Save the Liberty Theatre Act of 2021 
will allow the city of Eunice to restore its his-
toric Liberty Theatre. 
This historic theatre has hosted silent films, 
live bands, and other entertainment over its 
beautiful history. 
The Liberty Theatre has been a staple of 
Louisiana’s Cajun community for nearly 100 
years. 
With passage of this bill, the City of Eunice 
can proceed with its efforts to restore the the-
atre as an important center of culture and 
tourism. 
The bill will also direct the Secretary of the 
Interior to convey all rights, title, and interest 
of the federal government in specified areas of 
the ‘‘Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and 
Preserve’’ to the city of Eunice, Louisiana. 
That area includes an annex owned by the 
National Park Service (NPS) that is attached 
to the Liberty Theatre, which is owned by the 
city. 
The area the NPS owns is a section of the 
Liberty Theatre that provides a handicap ac-
cessible entrance, but this ownership interest 
in the property is hindering efforts to restore 
the theatre. 
The Save the Liberty Theatre Act of 2021 
would grant Eunice full ownership of the the-
atre property so the city can begin restoration 
efforts. 
The theatre’s stage has been dark since 
October 2019, and to local Cajun musicians 
like Joel Savoy, there is a fear that the center-
piece of the Cajun community will be nothing 
more than a memory. 
Savoy’s family is very connected to the the-
atre, as his parents were the driving force be-
hind a restoration project in the 1980s to re-
open the ornate building. 
The theatre’s return is vital to regional tour-
ism. 
Savoy, along with a handful of other Eunice 
residents, formed the Association for the Lib-
erty Theatre earlier this year. 
Their association is looking into ongoing 
revenue potential through private events, such 
as wedding receptions, so the theatre doesn’t 
shutter again in a few decades. 
Their goal is to renovate and reopen the 
theatre by 2024 to commemorate the 100th 
anniversary, and according to Savoy an anon-
ymous donor has committed to donating a 
‘‘substantial amount’’ of the projected $2 mil-
lion needed to return the theatre to its former 
glory. 
A handful of other Eunice residents plan on 
launching fundraising campaigns and other 
public planning projects if the legislation 
passes. 
The people of this community are willing to 
go the extra mile in hard work and funding to 
preserve this landmark that is dear to them. 
I encourage all my colleagues to join me 
and vote for H.R. 3197. 
Since the people of this community are will-
ing to come together to revitalize this land-
mark, we should support them.

RECOGNIZING MR. ARMOND 
MORRIS 
HON. AUSTIN SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. 
Armond Morris of Irwin County for his retire-
ment as Chairman of the Georgia Peanut 
Commission. 
While farming for over 50 years, Armond 
has advocated for the peanuty industry and 
farmers nationally and internationally. He 
served with the Georgia Peanut Commission 
for more than four decades and was chairman 
for 20 years. During his service, he led efforts 
to ensure that the U.S. peanut industry re-
mained competitive against imports, worked 
toward improving federal policies, and fought 
off regulation and disease that would’ve been 
harmful to the industry. His outstanding dedi-
cation 
to 
our 
nation’s 
peanut 
industry 
prioritized U.S. peanuts and grew the industry 
domestically. 
As a senior member of the House Agri-
culture Committee, I am honored to represent 
outstanding farmers such as Armond. It is indi-
viduals like him that make Georgia, and Amer-
ica, great.

HAITI 
DEVELOPMENT, 
ACCOUNT-
ABILITY, 
AND 
INSTITUTIONAL 
TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to address the gravity of the cyber 
threat to our national security and critical infra-
structure, especially as we face potential cyber 
threats from Russia following its horrific inva-
sion of Ukraine. The Federal Government 
must know when vital sectors of our Nation 
are affected by cyber attacks, so that we may 
deploy the full resources of the Federal Gov-
ernment to respond to and mitigate these at-
tacks. 
Division Y of the bipartisan ‘‘Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2022’’ will take significant 
steps to strengthen cybersecurity protections 
and ensure that the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency, or CISA, is at the 
forefront of our Nation’s response to serious 
cyber attacks by requiring timely reporting of 
these attacks to the Federal Government so 
that we can better prevent future incidents and 
hold attackers accountable. 
To be clear, Division Y of the Act, which is 
based on Rep. YVETTE D. CLARKE’s H.R. 
5440, the ‘‘Cyber Incident Reporting for Crit-
ical Infrastructure Act of 2021,’’ and its Senate 
companion legislation (S. 2875) sponsored by 
Senator GARY C. PETERS, does not impede 
the FBI or other law enforcement investiga-
tions against perpetrators of attacks. 
The 
plain 
text 
of 
Division 
Y 
makes 
Congress’s intent clear. Although the reports 
themselves—and 
any 
‘‘communication[s], 
document[s], or material[s], or other record[s] 
created for the sole purpose of preparing, 
drafting or submitting’’ those reports—may not 
be received in evidence, the FBI and other law 
enforcement entities nevertheless may make 
full use of the information contained in such 
materials in their investigations of a cyber inci-
dent or for other purposes authorized by the 
statute. Likewise, additional facts developed in 
those investigations may be used to further 
those investigations or activities, including in 
ex parte or other proceedings. In other words, 
although the FBI cannot attach the report filed 
with CISA in a warrant application or submit it 
in evidence in a trial, it may, as appropriate, 
use information contained in the reports and 
derived from them for a range of purposes, in-
cluding obtaining a warrant and prosecuting 
bad actors. Further, the legislative language 
also is not intended to prohibit or discourage 
entities from reporting to CISA and law en-
forcement concurrently. 
The language of this division makes clear 
that the information may be used for cyberse-
curity or investigative purposes. In the new 
section 2245 of the Homeland Security Act of 
2002 created by this division, it clearly states 
that reports submitted to CISA under this pro-
vision can be used for ‘‘the purpose of pre-
venting, investigating, disrupting, or pros-
ecuting an offense arising out of a cyber inci-
dent reported pursuant to’’ the statute’s re-
quirements or through voluntary reporting pro-
visions. 
Moreover, facts developed during an FBI in-
vestigation of a relevant cyber incident using 
other authorities are not subject to the evi-
dentiary 
restrictions 
found 
in 
section 
2245(c)(3) of the statute, including similar 
facts that may also have been disclosed to the 
Federal Government in the report to CISA. 
The FBI’s efforts to hold accountable, dis-
rupt, or deter perpetrators of cyber attacks are 
fully consistent with the goal of encouraging 
entities to disclose cyber incidents. As stake-
holders work through the rulemaking process, 
the committees of jurisdiction in both the 
House and the Senate look forward to working 
with them to ensure that congressional intent 
is not misinterpreted, and that this legislation 
is implemented as intended. 
Mr. Speaker, the hard work of many of my 
colleagues went into the inclusion of this im-
portant legislation in the ‘‘Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2022.’’ I want to thank especially 
Representatives CLARKE, JOHN KATKO, and 
ANDREW R. GARBARINO; and Senators PETERS, 
ROB PORTMAN, MARK R. WARNER, and SUSAN 
M. COLLINS.

RECOGNIZING SARA EGELSTON 
AKERS 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to recognize Sara Egelston Akers for a lifetime 
of service dedicated to fostering a love for the 
performing arts among the youth in our com-
munity. 
In 1991, what began as a single production 
of ‘‘The Wizard of Oz’’ at a local church, would 
go on to become the profoundly impactful 
Plano Children’s Theatre (PCT), one of the 
first youth theaters dedicated to providing chil-
dren from all backgrounds the opportunity to 
be on stage. Due to Sara’s efforts as the The-
atre’s Founder and Executive Director, in time 
multiple performance theatres and rehearsal 
studios would be established across North 
Texas. 
Among her most notable achievements dur-
ing her tenue with PCT, Sara pioneered the 
use of drama as a means of therapy, paving 
the way for the widespread implementation of 
adaptive performing arts programs for stu-
dents with disabilities. 
Over the past three decades, Sara has 
been a vital contributor to Plano’s performing 
arts landscape. Following her executive role 
with PTC, Sarah went on to a serve as the 
Vice President of Community Outreach for 
North Texas Performing Arts (NTPA), where 
she oversaw fundraising, community outreach, 
and diversity efforts. Under her leadership, 
NTPA has become the largest youth theatre in 
the country impacting thousands of families. 
For her many contributions within our com-
munity, Sara was recognized by the Plano 
Chamber of Commerce with the prestigious 
Athena Award, and the Lifetime Achievement 
Award from the Art Centre of Plano. In honor, 
NTPA has likewise established a ‘‘Sara 
Egelston Akers Legacy Fund’’ which will pro-
vide support for the organization’s scholarship 
initiatives. 
Following her retirement this May, Sara will 
continue to serve as a teacher and director 
maintaining an active role in the NTPA’s Arts 
Advisory Council, Governing Board of Direc-
tor’s, and the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
Task Force. 
Ms. Sara Egelston Akers, a gifted educator, 
artist, and leader, has undoubtedly made a 
lasting impact on the North Texas community, 
and though she will be missed, her future is 
sure to be filled with many wonderful new op-
portunities. 
As she prepares to embark on this next 
chapter of her life, I ask my colleagues in the 
U.S. House of Representatives to join me in 
honoring Sara Egelston Akers for her success-
ful career devoted to promoting accessibility 
among youth in the performing arts.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 
RETIREMENT OF KENNETH BICE 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the retirement of Ken-
neth Bice. 
Kenneth was born in Anniston, Alabama, on 
November 28, 1944. He now resides in 
Ohatchee, Alabama, with Fran, his wife of 40 
years. He has been blessed with five children, 
12 grandchildren and nine greatgrandchildren. 
After working with South Central Bell for 15 
years, Kenneth saw an opportunity to start a 
ground-breaking telecommunication company 
in Anniston, Alabama. As the telecommuni-
cation industry began rapidly changing with 
new FCC rulings allowing companies and indi-
viduals to buy their own telephone equipment 
instead of renting, he seized this opportunity 
and founded Telephone Communications, Inc 
(TCI) in 1979. TCI now serves thousands of 
customers with their managed services in the 
telecom, security and IT services industries. 
This successful company is the first of many 
companies Kenneth would begin. Other com-
panies he founded include: TelNet Corpora-
tion, Bice Enterprises, The Homestead & Lib-
erty Square, Blue Signs, Yello Wireless, Smart 
Ink, BCR Corporation, PHR, Inc., KB’s Res-
taurant and Action Auto. 
He has served his community over the 
years and been involved as a Graduate of 
Leadership Calhoun County, a member of the 
Calhoun County Chamber of Commerce, the 
Salvation Army Advisory Board, Anniston Main 
Street Board of Directors, Founder of Citizens 
for Safer Alabama, Calhoun County Economic 
Development Council, Colonial Bank Advisory 
Board, Board of Directors for the Berman 
Foundation Museum, Board member of Annis-
ton Retail Commercial Development Authority, 
Founder of Alabama Long Distance Associa-
tion, Volunteer fireman at Ohatchee Fire De-
partment and active member of Oak Bowery 
Church where he currently serves as Sunday 
School Teacher and Chairman of Properties 
Committee. 
He Received Small Business Leader of the 
Year for Calhoun County (1990, 1994) and 
Special Achievement Award from State of Ala-
bama (1990). 
Kenneth retired February 14, 2022 and will 
be honored March 29th with family and friends 
in Saks. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating my friend on his retirement and his 
tireless service to our community.

HONORING CHUCK FOWKE 
HON. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor one of 
my constituents, Mr. Chuck Fowke, a home 
builder and developer from Valrico, Florida, 
who on February 10th concluded his success-
ful term as the 2021 chairman of the National 
Association of Home Builders. 
As chairman, Chuck confronted the chal-
lenges he and his fellow builders faced during 
the COVID–19 pandemic head-on. His steady 
leadership at NAHB during the past year has 
paid great dividends as the housing industry 
has overcome new challenges. 
Chuck provided a laser-like focus to keep 
housing moving forward by working with the 
administration and lawmakers on both sides of 
the aisle to resolve issues pertaining to the 
price and availability of building materials, and 
the supply chain in general. He personally tes-
tified before Congress on this issue in Octo-
ber, calling on lawmakers to determine what 
action can be taken to address our nation’s 
troubled building materials supply chain. 
These efforts are paying dividends. Chuck 
and the NAHB have been working tirelessly to 
reduce lumber tariffs that have contributed to 
unprecedented price volatility and harmed 
housing affordability. These efforts proved 
successful as the Commerce Department an-
nounced on Jan. 31st that it would be lowering 
tariffs on Canadian lumber imports into the 
U.S. from 17.99 percent to 11.64 percent—a 
35 percent reduction. 
As founder and president of Homes by John 
C. Fowke Inc., Chuck has built hundreds of 
homes throughout Central Florida and the 
Tampa Bay area. He is dedicated to his indus-
try, having previously served as president of 
the Tampa Bay Builders Association and the 
Florida Home Builders Association. In 2019, 
he was inducted into the Florida Home Build-
ers Association Hall of Fame. 
Chuck also recognizes the importance of 
giving back to the community he’s helped 
build, having served as chairman of the Char-
ity Women’s Crisis Center’s Addition and Ren-
ovation Committee. He contributed to the ef-
forts of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes 
and the Joshua House and completed a 
project for the Gary Sinise Foundation for a 
deserving military widow and her children. 
I congratulate Chuck on his efforts to ensure 
that housing remains accessible and afford-
able to America’s families. I congratulate him 
on his successful tenure.

HONORING 
THE 
KENTUCKY 
SCIENCE CENTER’S 150TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the Kentucky Science 
Center—located in my hometown of Louisville, 
Kentucky—as this outstanding institution cele-
brates its 150th anniversary. 
Originally founded in 1871 as a ‘‘cabinet of 
curiosities’’ in the Public Library System of 
Kentucky, what was soon known as the Louis-
ville Museum of Natural History and Science 
has grown in size and scope to become the 
largest hands-on science center in the Com-
monwealth and one of our region’s leading re-
sources for education immersion. 
Simply put, they make science fun. At the 
core of the Kentucky Science Center’s mission 
are these simple instructions: ‘‘play, tinker, ex-
plore, collaborate, test, experiment, goof up, 
and try again.’’ Though their focus is helping 
teach their visitors about a specific field of 
study, I can’t think of more fitting instructions 
for any endeavor of learning, no matter your 
age. 
Their approach makes learning accessible 
to people from all walks of life. Whether you 
’re an individual, a family, or an educator with 
a classroom full of students, the Kentucky 
Science Center has a seemingly never-ending 
supply of programming tailored to meet your 
needs, helping you think big and learn more. 
Understanding the important role STEM edu-
cation plays in our future, the Kentucky 
Science Center has been an invaluable re-
source in advancing this field of study for all 
who are lucky to pass through its doors, help-
ing us prepare the next generation of leaders 
right here in Louisville. 
On behalf of the people of Kentucky’s Third 
Congressional District, I thank the administra-
tors, staff, volunteers, and supporters of the 
Kentucky Science Center for all of their hard 
work in making this place of learning such a 
valuable asset to our community. The Ken-
tucky Science Center has encouraged us to 
think critically, to immerse ourselves in the 
marvels of science, and to stay forever curi-
ous. I congratulate them on this important 
milestone and I look forward to another 150 
years.

HONORING SERVICE OF MSGT 
JOSHUA UPTON 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Master Sgt. Joshua 
Upton, crew chief with the 131st Aircraft Main-
tenance Squadron. He has recently been se-
lected as the 131st Bomb Wing’s Maintainer of 
the Year. 
Master Sgt. Joshua Upton has distinguished 
himself as an essential leader in the B–2 mis-
sion, providing both hard work and high per-
formance while stationed and deployed. He 
was awarded with an incentive flight in a B– 
2 Spirit bomber on January 9th. Sgt. Upton’s 
leadership as an aircraft-dedicated crew chief 
has led to the execution of 18 sorties and 
145.9 flying hours in support of 16 higher 
headquarters missions. 
Aircraft mechanics are essential to the 
maintenance, safety, and success of our 
Armed Forces. Without their long hours of 
hard work and commitment to detail, these 
sorties would not be possible. Mechanical 
teams and their crew chiefs work each day 
around the clock to ensure constant readiness 
for military aircraft that are vital to our national 
defense. Our adversaries never rest and nei-
ther do our aircraft maintenance squadrons. 
It is a great honor that I recognize the dedi-
cated service of Master Sgt. Joshua Upton. 
His steadfast leadership and continuous devo-
tion to each mission are part of what make our 
military the best in the world. I am proud of his 
accomplishment and his team of aircraft main-
tenance technicians for earning this recogni-
tion. Please join me in congratulating him for 
his dedicated service to our Nation.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SERVICE

THE NEW HAMPSHIRE FARM MU-
SEUM 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Jonathan B. Hotchkiss’s long 
history of volunteerism and nearly 20 years of 
service to the New Hampshire Farm Museum 
in Milton, NH. For the past two decades, Jona-
than has served his community as a steadfast 
supporter of New Hampshire agriculture and 
culture. 
Jon worked with the Farm Museum in a va-
riety of capacities including the facility mainte-
nance, cost-saving program development, 
grant writing, reenactments, and as both a 
member and President of the Board of Trust-
ees. He worked tirelessly to develop commu-
nity and business relationships that enabled 
the museum to become more organized, cre-
ative and financially stable.

March 16, 2022 
As public health precautions during the 
coronavirus pandemic caused many institu-
tions to close their doors to the public for pro-
longed periods of times and face financial 
hardship. Due to Jon’s hard work developing 
the museum’s innovative cost-saving program, 
the Farm Museum gained a financial stability 
that has helped it weather the continuing pan-
demic. 
Prior to 1900, nearly 90 percent of New 
Hampshire residents lived on a farm. Our 
state’s history is deeply tied to its agriculture 
and Jonathan’s commitment to the preserva-
tion of this history is commendable. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank Jonathan for his continued dedication to 
the Granite State and wish him the best as he 
transitions from his work with the museum.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
TEMPLE 
ISRAEL 
OF 
SCRANTON’S 
100TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor Temple Israel of Scranton and its con-
gregation who will be celebrating the 100th 
anniversary of the Temple’s founding June 
10–12, 2022. The congregation was organized 
in July 1921, but the celebration to mark this 
joyous occasion was postponed because of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
On July 14, 1921, a group of Jews gathered 
at the YMCA in response to urging by their 
peers to establish a modern synagogue in the 
City of Scranton. The result of that founders 
meeting was Temple Israel, a synagogue that 
‘‘would comply with the thoughts of the Amer-
ican Jew and would be conducted in accord-
ance with the best traditions of Judaism.’’ On 
September 21, 1921, Rabbi Alfred H. Kahn 
was installed as the first rabbi. During the final 
months of 1921, a Hebrew School was orga-
nized, the Temple was granted its charter, and 
the constitution and by-laws of the Temple 
were adopted. 
On April 11, 1923, plans to build a new 
Temple began, and a committee to oversee 
the 
process 
was 
formed 
with 
Isadore 
Finkelstein as chairman. Over the next three 
years, the committee drafted a report, raised 
funds, approved architectural plans, and hired 
contractors. On May 18, 1926, they broke 
ground for the new Temple, and on Sep-
tember 11, 1927, Rabbi Max Arzt dedicated 
the Temple in the afternoon and an evening 
banquet followed. The celebrations continued 
throughout the week with a Hebrew School 
Night, Ladies’ Auxiliary Night, Open House 
Night, the Dedication Ball, and culminated with 
religious services on Friday and Saturday. 
Rabbi Arzt, who served Temple Israel from 
1924 to 1939 before joining the faculty of the 
Jewish Theological Seminary in New York 
City, was not the only prominent clergy mem-
ber to lead the congregation. Other distin-
guished clergy include Rabbis Simon Shoop 
and David Geffen and Cantor William S. Horn, 
who served 50 years as cantor and youth in-
structor for the Temple Israel Junior Con-
gregation and Hebrew School, which educated 
thousands of Scranton’s Jewish youths over 
the past 100 years. 
Today, Temple Israel remains the only Con-
servative Synagogue in Lackawanna County 
and boasts a vibrant and welcoming con-
gregation in the heart of the City of Scranton. 
Rabbi Miriam Spitzer, one of the first female 
rabbis, and Cantor Vladimir Aronzon, who has 
served for more than two decades, are the 
Temple’s current clergy. They, along with the 
dedicated volunteers who serve as officers 
and on the board of directors, work tirelessly 
to foster an environment and community to 
meet the spiritual, educational, and social 
needs of their members. 
I am honored to join with Rabbi Spitzer and 
the entire Temple Israel congregation in cele-
brating 100 years of worship in the City of 
Scranton. Temple Israel has been an essential 
part of the Scranton community and Lacka-
wanna County at large as a center for Jewish 
thought, 
learning, 
and 
worship. 
This 
multigenerational congregation that celebrates 
diversity, spirituality, and community has wel-
comed countless worshipers over the years, 
and I know it will continue to be a beacon of 
Jewish faith and tradition for many generations 
to come.

Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Scotty 
Raines of Turner County for being named the 
2022 Georgia Farmer of the Year. 
Scotty is a lifelong contributor to the agri-
culture industry. After high school, he was an 
active member of the Turner County High 
School FFA chapter and worked as a farm 
technician for Agra Tech Seed Research. He 
began farming full-time in 1993, partnering 
with his father-in-law on 500 acres of rented 
land and establishing a personal herd of 30 
beef cows. Scotty has spent 28 years expand-
ing and diversifying his farming operation, em-
phasizing marketing strategies related to the 
cotton, corn, peanuts, and watermelons he 
produces on more than 2,300 acres today. His 
contributions to the local community and out-
standing agricultural achievements have not 
gone unnoticed. 
As a senior member of the House Agri-
culture Committee, I am honored to represent 
outstanding farmers such as Scotty. It is indi-
viduals like him that make Georgia, and Amer-
ica, great.

JAPANESE AMERICAN WORLD WAR 
II HISTORY NETWORK ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 6434, the Japanese Amer-
ican WWII History Network Act to direct the 
Secretary of the Interior to establish, within the 
National Park Service, the Japanese American 
World War II History Network. 
We must never forget the maltreatment that 
these Americans endured. 
The establishment of this network would 
educate generations to come on past racial in-
justices in our country, in an effort to avoid fu-
ture prejudice. 
The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 
December 7, 1941, marked the United States’ 
official entrance into World War II. 
Two months later, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which 
ordered 120,000 people of Japanese descent 
to be forcibly removed from their homes and 
placed in internment camps, based on the 
widespread suspicion that they were acting as 
foreign agents. 
The belief was baseless, but that didn’t stop 
the War Relocation Authority from rounding up 
more than 120,000 people—two-thirds of 
whom were U.S. citizens. 
Japanese Americans were interned and es-
sentially treated as prisoners. 
After decades of pressure from the Japa-
nese American League (JACL) and the Japa-
nese American community, President Jimmy 
Carter opened an investigation to determine if 
the imprisonment of these people was justified 
by the government. 
The investigation found virtually no evidence 
of Japanese disloyalty and concluded that the 
mass incarceration of Japanese Americans 
was a product of abject racism. 
In 1988, over 40 years after the internment 
camps closed, President Ronald Reagan 
signed the Civil Liberties Act, which offered a 
formal apology for the government’s policy to-
ward Japanese Americans and paid $20,000 
in compensation to each of the 80,000 living 
survivors. 
The reparations granted to the survivors and 
the official apology were necessary for our 
country to move past this grave racial injus-
tice. 
It must be noted that, just as our govern-
ment recognized that reparations to the Japa-
nese American community was necessary to 
acknowledge and move beyond that injustice, 
America’s original racist tragedy must be simi-
larly addressed. 
On July 30, 2008 the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives passed H. Res. 194 apologizing 
for American slavery and subsequent discrimi-
natory laws. 
The Senate has never passed a resolution, 
and no reparations have been granted. 
Millions of Africans and their descendants 
were enslaved in the United States from 1619 
through 1865. 
Slavery in America resembled no other form 
of involuntary servitude known in history, as 
Africans were captured and sold at auction 
like inanimate objects or animals. 
Africans forced into slavery were brutalized, 
humiliated, dehumanized, and subjected to the 
indignity of being stripped of their names and 
heritage. 
In 2022, he passage of H.R. 40 is essential 
to solving the deep racial, economic, social, 
and cultural divides in America. 
Now more than ever, the facts and cir-
cumstances facing our nation demonstrate the 
importance of H.R. 40 and the necessity of 
placing our nation on the path to reparative 
justice. 
By passing H.R. 40, Congress can start a 
movement toward the national reckoning that 
we need in order to bridge racial divides. 
Reparations are ultimately about respect 
and reconciliation and the hope that someday, 
all Americans can walk together toward a 
more just future. 
We owe it to the millions of Americans who 
were born into bondage, knew a life of ser-
vitude, and died anonymous deaths, as pris-
oners of this system. 
We owe it to the millions of descendants of 
these slaves, for they are the heirs to a soci-
ety of inequities and indignities that naturally 
filled the vacuum after slavery was formally 
abolished 154 years ago. 
Madam Speaker, the establishment of the 
Japanese American WWII History Network 
would represent much more than just a re-
source that will educate on inequality and bru-
tality in America. 
It represents Americans moving past injus-
tices and honoring those who were once vic-
tims of racial discrimination in our country. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 
6434, the Japanese American WII History Net-
work.

RECOGNIZING PROSPER MAYOR 
RAY SMITH 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to recognize Ray Smith as he prepares to de-
part his longtime service as the steadfast 
Mayor of Prosper, Texas. 
A 1981 graduate of Baylor University, Ray 
earned a Bachelor of Business Administration 
in Marketing and Real Estate. During his time 
at Baylor, Ray, the son of a former Dallas 
Cowboy, would passionately pursue football 
as a member of the renowned 1980 South-
west Conference Champion Football Team. 
Smith began his career in public service in 
Frisco, Texas where he served as a member 
of the City Council, Economic Development 
Corporation, Community Development Cor-
poration, Planning & Zoning Board, Frisco 
Education Foundation, and as a volunteer fire-
fighter during a period of unprecedented 
growth. 
In 2004, Ray was appointed the President 
of the Prosper Economic Development Cor-
poration where he continues to serve as coun-
cil liaison. In 2005, Ray and his family would 
relocate to the Town of Prosper where he 
would plant deep roots and play an integral 
role in the town’s early development. Fol-
lowing his service on Town Council, Ray was 
elected Mayor in 2010. 
Over the past twelve years, Mayor Smith’s 
leadership has helped cultivate the town’s 
rapid but intentional growth. By managing the 
town in a manner that focuses on the long- 
term wellbeing of its residents, Smith has 
worked to implement needed structural im-
provements while preserving neighborhood 
greenspace. During his tenue, the community 
has tripled in growth, and new residents are 
frequently known to receive Smith’s personally 
signed welcome letter—a trademark of the af-
fable leader. 
In addition to his many leadership roles on 
numerous boards, councils, and committees, 
in 2016 Ray was elected to serve on the North 
Central Texas Council of Governments Execu-
tive Board and was elected President of the 
Board in 2020. He is currently the Chair of the 
Collin College Foundation Board of Directors, 
a member of the Meals on Wheels of Collin 
County Advisory Board, and an Alternate 
Member of the Regional Transportation Coun-
cil. 
While Ray’s many efforts have undoubtedly 
made a lasting impact on the region, his great-
est achievement is his family. Ray and his 
wife of 31 years, Lena, were blessed with 
three sons and two grandsons, Jacob and 
Jackson, whom they are helping to raise. 
Ray Smith has undoubtedly made a lasting 
impact on the Prosper community, and while 
his tenure as Mayor is coming to a close, he 
will certainly continue to forge a tremendous 
legacy. As he prepares to begin a new chap-
ter of his life, I ask my colleagues in the U.S. 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Ray Smith for his selfless and dedi-
cated service.

Wednesday, March 16, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Cassidy 
Boggus for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Cassidy Boggus is a student at Ralston Val-
ley High School and received this award be-
cause her determination and hard work have 
allowed her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Cassidy 
Boggus is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Cas-
sidy Boggus for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.
