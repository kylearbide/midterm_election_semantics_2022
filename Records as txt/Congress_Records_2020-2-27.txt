HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE 
OF NATIONAL HERITAGE AREAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight 
the importance of our Nation’s Na-
tional Heritage Areas. These sites are 
rich with history, culture, and the 
marvels of our Nation’s natural re-
sources. 
In 1984, President Ronald Reagan 
signed the first National Heritage Area 
into law, calling it ‘‘a new kind of na-
tional park.’’ Today, nearly 40 years 
later, our Nation touts 55 National Her-
itage Areas across the country. 
I am proud of the 12 National Herit-
age Areas in Pennsylvania, more than 
any other State in the Nation. Na-
tional Heritage Areas in Pennsylvania 
span 57 of our 67 counties, and these 
areas are truly an economic develop-
ment powerhouse. 
In 2014, tourists spent an estimated $2 
billion worth of goods and services dur-
ing their travels to Pennsylvania’s Na-
tional Heritage Areas. That is $2 bil-
lion back into our rural communities. 
One of those areas, the Oil Region 
National Heritage Area, is in my dis-
trict. The oil region was established as 
a Pennsylvania Heritage Area in 1994. 
Ten years later it became a National 
Heritage Area. 
Pennsylvania’s oil region is rich with 
history. In 1859, Edwin Drake changed 
our Nation’s energy future forever 
when he drilled the world’s first com-
mercial oil well in Titusville, Pennsyl-
vania, which is in my congressional 
district, 
establishing 
Pennsylvania’s 
oil region as the birthplace of the 
world’s petroleum industry. 
Recently, I had the pleasure of join-
ing the Alliance of National Heritage 
Areas for their annual Heart & Soul 
Breakfast, where I was reminded of the 
positive impact that these areas have 
on our communities. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
National 
Heritage 
Areas represent one of the finest public 
public-private partnership models in 
the country. It is for that reason and 
their unwavering commitment to pre-
serving our Nation’s history that I am 
so proud to stand beside them as they 
tirelessly promote our Nation’s rich 
history. 
National Heritage Areas are pre-
serving our Nation’s history, not only 
to celebrate it, but to learn from it 
and, quite frankly, to create economic 
development and opportunity utilizing 
it. 
RECOGNIZING THE 176TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
INDEPENDENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, today 
is February 27, and we celebrate the 
176th anniversary of independence of 
the Dominican Republic, which gained 
its independence in 1844 from the Re-
public of Haiti. 
Led by Juan Pablo Duarte, Sanchez, 
and Mella, this island nation moved 
forward 
under 
great 
adversity. 
Throughout its 176 years, it has en-
dured military occupation, dictator-
ship, and other strong and determining 
challenges. But throughout these many 
decades, the nation has prevailed. 
Today, we enjoy the presence of over 
2 million Dominicans in the United 
States, many of them in New York 
State, and many of them in the 13th 
Congressional District, particularly in 
Washington Heights. 
We see many streets in the neighbor-
hood named after some of the patri-
archs of the nation. We have Juan 
Pablo 
Duarte 
Boulevard, 
Manolo 
Tavarez Justo Way, Mateo Rojas Alou 
Street, Miguel Amaro Way, Freddy 
Beras-Goico Way. 
We also have schools named after 
very prominent members of that com-
munity. Salome Urena School, the 
Mirabal Sisters School, Juan Pablo 
Duarte School, the Juan Bosch School. 
We also have a huge parade, which 
now goes down Sixth Avenue, but origi-
nally started right there on Audubon 
Avenue in Northern Manhattan. 
We have social and cultural institu-
tions like Club Deportivo Dominicano. 
We have many bodega owners, super-
market owners, hair salons, and other 
small businesses that I think are char-
acteristic of their resolve, our people’s 
resolve to work hard and make it a bet-
ter city for all of us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1228 
February 27, 2020 
We send remittances back home, be-
coming the first and most important 
column of the Dominican economy, and 
we continue to contribute in many, 
many ways to that island nation and 
the United States of America. 
Last Saturday, we witnessed an un-
precedented event where young people 
convened in Washington Heights to 
protest the failed municipal elections 
back home. 
Last 
weekend, 
the 
Washington 
Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, 
which I am honored to represent in 
Congress, 
witnessed 
thousands 
of 
young people who came to protest 
against the most recent failure by the 
Dominican Republic’s electoral board 
to properly execute the country’s mu-
nicipal elections on February 16. 
Tais Garcia Heredia, Emely Curiel, 
Andres Gonzalez del Rey, Candido 
Santana, 
Alberto 
Valentin, 
Albelis 
Reyes, and others, particularly a young 
man by the name of Felipe Batista, led 
these young people—thousands. Close 
to 10,000 of them descended on Wash-
ington Heights. 
Their initiative to fight for their peo-
ple’s future will probably not go down 
in the history books; you may not be 
able to find them in a Wikipedia page 
in the future; you may not be able to 
even Google their names; but their 
names will be echoed in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD, and their patriotism 
will forever be remembered. 
They are fighting to strengthen de-
mocracy. 
They 
are 
fighting 
to 
strengthen the best values of any 
democratic system and process. That is 
why I am here: to exult their names 
and to tell all that know them that we 
are very proud of them. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Today we are fighting for Dominican 
Independence, wherever there’s a Do-
minican there’s homeland. God, home-
land and freedom. 
Hoy en dı´a estamos luchando por la 
Independencia Dominicana, donde esta´ 
el dominicano esta la Patria. Dios, 
Patria y Libertad. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York will provide a 
translation of his remarks to the 
Clerk. 
f 
EFFORTS TO FIGHT ASIAN CARP 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, last week, 
I had the opportunity to travel to Ken-
tucky Lake, alongside Senate Majority 
Leader MITCH
MCCONNELL
and other 
local leaders, to observe progress being 
made to remove Asian carp from our 
west Kentucky waterways. Senator 
MCCONNELL and I took a boat out on 
the water to observe the new Modified 
Unified 
Method 
for 
removing 
this 
invasive species from our lakes. 
Thanks to Federal funding we have 
secured, efforts are in progress that 
will improve the fishing industry and 
our overall tourist economy in the 
First Congressional District of Ken-
tucky. The Federal resources that have 
been steered toward this problem are 
instrumental in fighting the war on 
carp. 
It has truly been a team approach, 
with local leaders like Lyon County 
Judge-Executive Wade White doing a 
tremendous job of advocating for ac-
tion. 
While there is certainly work left to 
do to eradicate Asian carp, we are mov-
ing in the right direction. I pledge to 
continue working with State and local 
officials and to be an effective Federal 
partner moving forward to rid our 
waters of this harmful species. 
HONORING UNION COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT 
PATRICIA SHEFFER 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
Union 
County 
Schools 
Superintendent 
Patricia 
Sheffer for winning the F.L. Dupree 
Outstanding 
Superintendent 
Award. 
This prestigious honor is awarded an-
nually by the Kentucky School Boards 
Association to a leader who has dem-
onstrated a high level of accomplish-
ment within their school system. 
Serving 
as 
superintendent 
comes 
with a variety of steep challenges and 
responsibilities. Based on this award, 
Patricia has gone above and beyond to 
excel in this critically important role. 
She has committed her career to 
working with community leaders to 
improve opportunities for the next gen-
eration, including placing a heavy em-
phasis on improving career and tech-
nical education opportunities. 
Mr. Speaker, her impact on Union 
County and public education cannot be 
overstated. I have seen firsthand the 
great work Ms. Sheffer has done there 
in Morganfield, and I join with all of 
my constituents in the First Congres-
sional District of Kentucky in con-
gratulating her. 
HONORING NATIONAL FUTURE FARMERS OF 
AMERICA WEEK 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of National FFA 
Week, an event that always brings 
back fond memories and is very special 
to me. Not only am I a proud farmer 
and 
former 
commissioner 
of 
agri-
culture, but I was also very active in 
FFA and had the high honor of serving 
as Kentucky FFA president. 
FFA had an extraordinary influence 
on my life, as I know it does for many 
young people today. I proudly display 
my blue and gold jacket here in my 
congressional office. 
While I will admit to being biased, 
there is no better way to learn, grow, 
and excel than being part of FFA. This 
quality organization uses agriculture 
education to empower students and put 
them on a lifelong path to success. 
The leadership skills that students 
gain through FFA are extremely valu-
able, and I know that it makes a posi-
tive difference in the lives of young 
people every day. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent 
so many high-quality FFA programs, 
leaders, and students here in Wash-
ington, and FFA will always hold a 
special place in my heart. 
f 
ONE YEAR SINCE WE VOTED TO 
PREVENT 
UNNECESSARY 
GUN 
DEATHS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
the anniversary of the House passage of 
H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act. 
It is has been 1 year since we stood 
together in this Chamber, Democrats 
and Republicans, and voted to pass a 
commonsense bill that will help save 
lives; 1 year since we voted to prevent 
unnecessary gun deaths and keep guns 
away from those who should not have 
them; 1 year since we acted to protect 
our children, to protect our commu-
nities, and to protect our families. 
One hundred Americans die every 
single day from gun violence. In 2020, 
there have already been more gun 
deaths in the United States than our 
peer countries will experience in an en-
tire year. That is unconscionable, and 
it is why 90 percent of our country sup-
ports universal background checks. 
Yet, we are told that, instead of 
changing our laws, we must have more 
active-shooter drills; more first graders 
coming home with tears in their eyes, 
6-year-olds asked to decide for them-
selves whether they are more likely to 
survive by hiding in a closet or if they 
should rush the gunman; more moth-
er’s reading messages from their chil-
dren locked inside a school that plead: 
Mom, if I don’t make it home, I love 
you, and I appreciate everything that 
you have done for me. 
Too often we are told that we must 
accept these tragedies, but millions of 
Americans refuse to accept that, and I 
stand with them. 
Today marks 1 year since we passed 
the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. 
Tomorrow marks 1 year since the 
passage of the Enhanced Background 
Check Act, which would close the 
Charleston loophole. 
I introduced a bill that would give 
loved ones and law enforcement more 
tools to keep guns away from those 
who are a danger to themselves or to 
others, tools that would help people 
like Mary Miller-Strobel, whose broth-
er, Ben, was a combat veteran suffering 
from depression and PTSD. 
Mary and her family worried about 
his mental health, and they drove to 
every gun store in their area pleading 
with the store owners not to sell her 
brother a gun. Ben Miller died by sui-
cide. He used the gun he bought at his 
local gun store. 
b 1015 
There is injustice in this year with-
out action. I know that sense of injus-
tice. On black Friday in November 2012, 
my son Jordan was sitting in the back 
seat of a car at a gas station with his

friends. A man pulled up next to them 
and complained about the loud music 
that they were playing. 
He pulled out a gun and he fired 10 
shots into that car hitting Jordan 
three times, killing my only son. 
I lost my son. But I am still his 
mother and I am on a mission to help 
protect the lives of children like him 
all over America. 
I made a promise to my community 
that I would act in Washington. 
I promised that I would take that 
sense of protection, that love a mother 
has for her only son, and use it for my 
community, use it for the American 
people. 
I promised I would dedicate my life 
to families like mine in Marietta, 
Georgia, who are terrified that they 
will send their kids to school and never 
see them come home. They are terri-
fied they will be me. 
I pray that on the 1-year anniversary 
of H.R. 8, that we remember that this 
is in our hands. We remember families 
like Mary’s. We remember children 
graduating from high school. We re-
member Florida. We remember commu-
nities all across this country. Their 
lives are in our hands. 
I want to thank my colleagues, sur-
vivors, and volunteers, and advocates 
across America that are here with us 
today for your tireless work to pass 
this landmark legislation and protect 
our families. 
I pray that God bless us all in this 
fight to save American lives.

HONORING 
THE 
75TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BATTLE OF IWO 
JIMA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the 75th anniversary of the 
battle for Iwo Jima. I had the privilege 
of joining Senator YOUNG at a cere-
mony last week in Indianapolis to com-
memorate this fateful battle that led 
to the allied victory in World War II. 
With us at the Indiana War Memorial 
was Wayne Saucerman, a World War II 
marine veteran of Iwo Jima and a true 
American hero. 
Seventy-five years ago Wayne found 
himself thousands of miles away from 
home in the midst of a fierce 5-week 
battle that would help change the 
course of the war and history itself. 
To Wayne and to other patriots who 
fight for the freedom and liberty we 
hold so dear, thank you for your serv-
ice. 
Next month I will have the honor of 
returning to the island as part of a con-
gressional delegation invited to par-
ticipate in the 75th Reunion of Honor 
on Iwo Jima. We will be joined by the 
commandant of the Marine Corps and 
dignitaries from Japan to renew this 
commitment by remembering and hon-
oring those who fought 75 years ago. 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUTS FARMERS FIRST 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to commend President Trump’s leader-
ship on the Waters of the United States 
issue and support his repeal of the bur-
densome Obama-era regulation. 
As a result of this decision, our farm-
ers can worry less about government 
overreach on their own property and 
instead focus on building and growing 
their farms and small businesses. We fi-
nally have an administration that puts 
our farmers first, and for Hoosiers in 
my district, that is a big deal. 
I pledge my commitment to farmers 
and families in my district to continue 
working with the Trump administra-
tion on this very critical issue. 
RECOGNIZING AHAUS TOOL AND ENGINEERING 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Ahaus Tool and Engineer-
ing in Richmond, Indiana for their ef-
fective apprenticeship program. 
While recently visiting Ahaus, their 
leadership told me about their nation-
ally 
accredited 
apprenticeship 
pro-
gram, which has been helping Hoosiers 
for over 30 years. 
Ahaus offers a full-time job while 
their employees attend school to gain 
hands-on 
learning 
experience 
with 
peers in the company. 
I wish Ahaus continued success and I 
thank them for their investment in the 
community of Richmond. 
RECOGNIZING THE GOOD SAMARITAN FOOD 
PANTRY 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Good Samaritan Food 
Pantry of North Vernon and its won-
derful manager, Ginger Miller. 
The Good Samaritan Food Pantry 
served over 29,000 Jennings County 
residents last year, including 1,000 vet-
erans. The Good Samaritan Food Pan-
try is run by an all-volunteer staff and 
runs completely on donations. 
Not only does this organization help 
feed those in need, but it also provides 
clothing and household items for fami-
lies in need. 
God bless those that help the Good 
Samaritan Food Pantry run, and God 
bless all the volunteers involved. 
CONGRATULATING SILAS ALLRED 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Silas Allred of Shen-
andoah High School for winning the 
195-pound weight class Indiana Wres-
tling State Title. 
This is Silas’ second straight wres-
tling State title, and he joined an elite 
group of only one of five Indiana high 
school wrestlers in history to win the 
title by pin. 
Silas is ranked fourth in the Nation 
for his weight class and qualified for 
Team U.S.A. to compete at the Pan Am 
Cadet Games. 
I congratulate Silas and wish him the 
best of luck in his future. 
f 
TAKING STRONG ACTION TO STOP 
THE EPIDEMIC OF YOUTH TO-
BACCO USE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, this 
week the House is taking strong action 
to stop the epidemic of youth tobacco 
use. 
We have watched as the use of to-
bacco and vape products by kids has 
exploded in our community over the 
past months. It has become a full- 
blown public health crisis affecting 
more than 5 million kids. 
More than 200 Illinoisans have suf-
fered respiratory illness from dan-
gerous vape products since last year. 
Eight of them have died. This shouldn’t 
be happening. 
Thanks to decades of public health 
work and education, youth tobacco use 
was actually going down until the in-
troduction of sophisticated vape prod-
ucts. 
Let’s be clear, these products are tar-
geted at kids. They are made with fla-
vors like cotton candy and gummy 
bears. They are marketed directly to 
children, and they are designed to keep 
children hooked. 
This is a crisis that we will be deal-
ing with for decades because 95 percent 
of adult tobacco users started when 
they were kids, and there is still so 
much that we don’t know about how 
the high doses of nicotine and other 
chemicals in these products affect kids’ 
bodies and their minds. 
Given the FDA’s failure to effectively 
regulate 
these 
products, 
Congress 
needs to act now before it is too late. It 
is time to stand up and refuse to let 
our kids be hurt. It is time to pass the 
Protecting American Lungs and Re-
versing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic 
Act of 2019. 
f 
RECOGNIZING BUCKS COUNTY 
COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Bucks 
County Community College, which re-
cently received a $200,000 grant to raise 
awareness and promote its metal work-
ing apprenticeship program. 
This 12-week program provides entry- 
level training, forklift certification, 
and other skills necessary to begin a 
career in manufacturing. The Pennsyl-
vania Department of Community and 
Economic Development grant will be 
used to promote Bucks County Com-
munity 
College’s 
manufacturing 
preapprenticeship training programs. 
Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I 
partnered with Bucks County native, 
Congressman RO KHANNA, to introduce 
the Student Apprenticeship Act, a bill 
that would close the gap between high-
er education and labor by modernizing 
workforce training and catalyzing the 
growth of registered apprenticeships 
nationwide. 
Apprenticeship 
programs 
provide 
skills and education for high-paying 
jobs and vital careers, and we need to 
be sure we give them the attention 
that they deserve.

H1230 
February 27, 2020 
Torrente of the Middletown Township 
Police Department. 
Sergeant 
Torrente 
was 
the 
first 
woman in the history of the police de-
partment to be promoted from patrol 
officer to detective in 2014. Recently 
Aileen was promoted again; this time 
from detective to her current rank of 
sergeant. 
Sergeant Torrente’s success will set a 
great example for current and future 
officers at my hometown township po-
lice 
department 
in 
Middletown. 
Aileen’s hard work, determination, and 
diligence led to her promotion. She is a 
great role model for our community, 
and I look forward to seeing more pro-
motions in the future as she works her 
way up to her dream job of chief of po-
lice. Mr. Speaker, I wish her well. 
RECOGNIZING BENSALEM TOWNSHIP COUNCIL 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Bensalem 
Township Council, who took a huge 
step to ensure the safety and well- 
being of their residents by prohibiting 
vaping in public township facilities, in-
cluding parks and other recreational 
areas. 
The health and safety of our children 
should be our top priority, and the re-
cent youth vaping epidemic has been a 
huge health issue in our community 
and across our Nation. 
I recently had the opportunity to 
meet with students from New Hope 
Solebury Cares who expressed their 
concerns with how prevalent vaping 
has become in their schools, and they 
talked about solutions that we can 
work on to bring attention to this 
issue. 
Part of the rise in youth vaping has 
been attributed to flavored nicotine. 
Flavors such as mango, cucumber, and 
other types of flavors undoubtedly tar-
get our children. 
Tomorrow the House will vote on 
final passage of H.R. 2339, the Pro-
tecting American Lungs and Reversing 
the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act. This 
legislation 
would 
ban 
all 
flavored 
vaping products, e-cigarette ads tar-
geting youth, and remote cigarette 
sales. As a cosponsor of this bill, I look 
forward to voting in favor of this bill 
and taking a much-needed step to miti-
gate tobacco use among our children.

COMMEMORATING 
JAZZ 
AND 
FRIENDS 
NATIONAL 
DAY 
OF 
SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY READ-
INGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of transgender and non-
binary 
youth. 
Today 
is 
Jazz 
and 
Friends National Day of School and 
Community Readings. 
I would like to read the book ‘‘I Am 
Jazz’’ by Jessica Herthel and Jazz Jen-
nings. 
I Am Jazz! 
For as long as I can remember, my favorite 
color has been pink. (My second-favorite 
color is silver and my third-favorite color is 
green.) 
Here are some of my other favorite things: 
dancing, singing, back flips, drawing, soccer, 
swimming, makeup, and pretending I’m a 
pop star. 
Most of all, I love mermaids. Sometimes I 
even wear a mermaid tail in the pool! 
My best friends are Samantha and Casey. 
We always have fun together. We like high 
heels and princess gowns, or cartwheels and 
trampolines. 
But I’m not exactly like Samantha and 
Casey. 
I have a girl brain but a boy body. This is 
called transgender. 
I was born this way! 
When I was very little, and my mom would 
say, ‘‘You’re such a good boy,’’ I would say, 
‘‘No, Mama. Good GIRL!’’ 
At first my family was confused. They’d al-
ways thought of me as a boy. 
As I got older, I hardly ever played with 
trucks 
or 
tools 
or 
superheroes. 
Only 
princesses and mermaid costumes. 
My brothers told me this was girl stuff. I 
kept right on playing. 
My sister says I was always talking to her 
about my girl thoughts, and my girl dreams, 
and how one day I would be a beautiful lady. 
She would giggle and say, ‘‘You’re a funny 
kid.’’ 
Sometimes my parents let me wear my sis-
ter’s dresses around the house. But whenever 
we went out, I had to put on my boy clothes 
again. This made me mad! 
Still, I never gave up trying to convince 
them. Pretending I was a boy felt like telling 
a lie. 
Then 
one 
amazing 
day, 
everything 
changed. Mom and Dad took me to meet a 
new doctor who asked me lots and lots of 
questions. Afterward, the doctor spoke to my 
parents and I heard the word ‘‘transgender’’ 
for the very first time. 
That night at bedtime, my parents both 
hugged me and said, ‘‘We understand now. Be 
who you are. We love you no matter what.’’ 
This made me smile and smile and smile. 
b 1030 
Mom and Dad told me I could start wear-
ing girl clothes to school, and growing my 
hair long. They even let me change my name 
to Jazz. 
Being JAZZ felt much more like being ME! 
Mom said that being Jazz would make me 
different from the other kids at school, but 
that being different is okay. What’s impor-
tant, she said, is that I’m happy with who I 
am. 
Being Jazz caused some other people to be 
confused too, like the teachers at school. 
At the beginning of the year they wanted 
me to use the boys’ bathroom, and play on 
the boys’ team in gym class, but that didn’t 
feel normal to me at ALL. 
I was so happy when the teachers changed 
their minds. I can’t imagine not playing on 
the same team as Casey and Samantha. 
Even today, there are kids who tease me, 
or call me by a boy name, or ignore me alto-
gether. This makes me feel crummy. 
Then I remember that the kids who get to 
know me usually want to be my friend. They 
say I’m one of the nicest girls at school. 
I don’t mind being different. Different is 
special! I think what matters most is what a 
person is like inside. 
And inside, I am happy. I am having fun. I 
am proud! 
I am Jazz! 
Thank you, Jazz Jennings, for your 
courage. 
CHILDREN NEED OPPORTUNITY TO 
EXPLORE 
GENDER 
IDENTITY 
WITHOUT CRITICISM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. SPEIER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise 
to speak about a book, a book much 
like ‘‘I Am Jazz’’ that I have had the 
privilege of reading before on the 
House floor for a number of years. It is 
an opportunity for children to explore 
their gender identity without being 
criticized. This book is titled ‘‘They, 
She, He easy as ABC.’’ 
They! they! They! they! New friends are ev-
erywhere waiting to play! 
Out on the dance floor we love to sing 
they. They is a way to let everyone be. No 
one left out and everyone free. Then when 
we’re friends, we sing they, she, he, ze. Mak-
ing it easy as a-b-c-d. 
Let’s dance! 
A. Ari loves to arabesque. They hold their 
pose with ease. 
B. Brody is a break dancer. Brody loves to 
freeze. 
C. Cory leaps high like a cat. She springs 
and leaps and bounds. 
D. Diego drums and dances. Tree has all 
the sounds. 
E. Ebony flies everywhere. They spread 
their arms like wings. 
F. Fawn is free as a flower. Fawn can bring 
the spring. 
G. Gia’s going fast and strong. She’s danc-
ing on the go. 
H. Harvey’s heart beats happily. Hip hop 
makes her flow. 
I. Indigo’s into insects. Ze loves the buzz-
ing vibe. 
J. Jorge jams to jazzy tunes. He or they 
can jive. 
K. Kelly can kick super high. His heart 
lives in the sky. 
L. Lourdes sings of lofty heights. Their 
songs let them fly. 
M. Marley is a star mermaid. He or she 
flows with the sea. 
N. Nathan is a nesting bird. He just wants 
to be. 
O. Ocean’s arms are open wide. Tree swings 
and sways about. 
P. Paul pretends to be a plant. Paul grows 
up and OUT. 
Q. Quetzal is so, so quiet. He rests just like 
a queen. 
R. Rene is into rainbows. He creates the 
scene. 
S. Sky is like a star so bright. All the pro-
nouns are right. 
T. Tai is tiger in the night. He claims his 
own might. 
U. Una is a unicorn. They prance to their 
own sound. 
V. Viola’s a volcano. Her power’s in her 
ground. 
W. Wren whistles when she dances. She 
knows just what to do. 
X. Xander exaggerates moves. They’re ex-
tremely cool. 
Y. Yoli yells YES! joyously. Their voice be-
comes the song. 
Z. Zahara zooms in and out. Ze knows that 
ze belongs. 
Now’s your chance. We need your moves. 
Join the dance. There’s always room. 
Maya makes the art and words. She sings 
the song to life. Matthew dreams and tin-
kers. He makes the work tight. 
Together they make books for the kids 
they used to be. And for their own two kids 
so all kids can grow free!

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1231 
February 27, 2020 
HONORING ALBERT HENDERSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor an exceptional veteran in my 
hometown of Fresno, California, Albert 
Henderson. 
In this photo, Albert Henderson and I 
are here at the veterans home in Fres-
no, a wonderful facility that provides a 
continuum of care for those men and 
women who served our Nation over the 
years. 
Albert has an incredible story. He is 
one of the last living survivors of the 
USS Bismarck Sea, which sank 75 years 
ago this month during a World War II 
battle on the island of Iwo Jima. We all 
know of that historic battle that took 
place on Iwo Jima. 
His is a story of survival, and it is a 
remarkable one. 
He joined the Navy as a cook at the 
age of 17. After learning of the attack 
on Pearl Harbor, like many Americans 
who decided to selflessly do everything 
they could to protect our country, he 
began his military journey on the USS 
Bismarck Sea as a chef second class, 
where he often speaks of the difficul-
ties of preparing food for such a large 
group of folks. 
As the ship made its way to the Phil-
ippines in 1944, its fate was sealed when 
it was struck by two Japanese kami-
kaze pilots. 
In the kitchen at the time of the at-
tack, Albert made it topside only to 
discover that all the life rafts and pre-
servers were taken by other members 
of the crew. 
He spent more than 4 hours strug-
gling to stay afloat in the choppy 
waters of the Pacific Ocean, praying 
for God’s help to survive after being 
rescued by a passing U.S. Navy motor-
boat. 
For his services and injuries, Albert 
was awarded the Purple Heart and the 
Good Conduct Medal. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
today to join me in recognizing an 
American hero for this remarkable mo-
ment in history for a remarkable man 
over 75 years ago. 
Albert, we thank you for your sac-
rifice and your courage to our Nation. 
God bless. 
FACING CORONAVIRUS CHALLENGES 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to talk about the challenges facing our 
country and the world with the recent 
outbreak of the coronavirus. 
This disease presents a serious threat 
that I think requires a proactive ap-
proach in a bipartisan fashion. 
Unfortunately, the mechanisms put 
in place by the previous administra-
tion, the Obama administration, to 
deal with pandemics like this have 
been dismantled over the last year. 
They were put in place to deal with the 
Ebola crisis and the SARS crisis years 
ago and to ensure that in the future, if 
possible pandemics occurred, we would 
be prepared. 
In 2018, the President fired the entire 
pandemic response team. In the Presi-
dent’s 2021 budget request, he proposed 
cutting over $700 million to the Centers 
for Disease Control. Hopefully, this 
proposal will be dead on arrival. In the 
face of this crisis, this is simply unac-
ceptable. 
We need to be on guard. The social 
and economic impacts of this pandemic 
could be devastating globally, but the 
public health crisis affects all Ameri-
cans. 
We have just had the first case, in 
the last 24 hours, in northern Cali-
fornia that, it is believed, the cause, 
the origin, is from here in our country, 
not coming from China. 
We require a robust response. The 
Congress and the President need to 
work together in a bipartisan fashion 
to ensure the well-being, public health, 
and safety of the American people. 
Hopefully, 
the 
President 
of 
the 
United States’ press conference yester-
day reflects the administration’s in-
tent to work together. We need to. 
I am committed to joining my col-
leagues to ensure that we have an ef-
fective strategy in place to protect all 
Americans’ health and safety from this 
potentially deadly pandemic virus, oth-
erwise known as coronavirus. 
We need to be on guard. We need to 
do everything we can to protect the 
American people. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until noon 
today. 
Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 40 
minutes a.m.), the House stood in re-
cess.

AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker at 
noon. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Merciful God, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
As we meditate on all the blessings of 
life, we especially pray for the blessing 
of peace in our lives and in our world. 
The 
current 
spread 
of 
the 
coronavirus has already caused broad 
repercussions in financial markets, 
international trade and travel, and the 
healthcare industry worldwide. We ask 
Your blessings on those men and 
women whose life work is the health of 
the world’s population and whose ef-
forts to stem the spread of this disease 
have endangered their own well-being. 
Give them insight and protection in 
the days and weeks to come. 
May Your special blessings be upon 
the Members of this assembly, in the 
important, sometimes difficult work 
they do. Give them wisdom and char-
ity, that they might work together for 
the common good. 
May all that is done this day in the 
people’s House be for Your greater 
honor and glory. 
Amen. 
f 
THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam-
ined the Journal of the last day’s pro-
ceedings and announces to the House 
her approval thereof. 
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, 
rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to 
the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. 
The SPEAKER. The question is on 
the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on 
the ground that a quorum is not 
present and make the point of order 
that a quorum is not present. 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, 
rule XX, further proceedings on this 
question will be postponed. 
The point of no quorum is considered 
withdrawn. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio led the 
Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle.

UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS 
TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES 
(Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, a 
year ago, this House passed the bipar-
tisan H.R. 8 to establish universal 
background checks to protect our com-
munities from terrifying, paralyzing 
gun violence. In the 365 days since, 
MITCH
MCCONNELL
has done exactly 
what the gun industry has asked him 
to do: nothing. 
Meanwhile, a gunman killed five peo-
ple yesterday in Milwaukee, and two 
teenagers were killed 5 miles from 
where we stand over the weekend. 
Meanwhile, millions live with the 
physical and emotional scars caused by 
guns.

February 27, 2020 
Meanwhile, 
the 
gun 
industry 
is 
wrapped with immunity that shields 
their profits and puts more guns on our 
streets. 
Madam Speaker, there is a secret 
that President Trump and Mr. MCCON-
NELL are hiding—you are subsidizing 
this industry: 
Billions in medical costs, covered by 
your tax dollars; 
Billions in lost wages, covered by 
your tax dollars; 
Eighty-seven percent of the costs in-
curred after a bullet pierces a person’s 
skin, covered by you. 
We are propping up an industry that 
profits off of our pain. 
Enough.

PARTICIPATING IN THE COMMIS-
SION 
ON 
SECURITY 
AND 
CO-
OPERATION IN EUROPE 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, last week, I was grateful to 
participate with the delegation for the 
Commission on Security and Coopera-
tion in Europe, co-chaired by Congress-
man ALCEE
HASTINGS
and Senator 
ROGER WICKER, in Vienna, Austria. We 
attended the OSCE Parliamentary As-
sembly’s 19th Winter Meeting. 
The delegation engaged with OSCE 
officials and parliamentary members 
from 57 nations. Ambassador Jim Gil-
more and his wife, Roxane, were effec-
tive assuring allies and potential ad-
versaries of American commitment for 
peace through strength. 
It was especially meaningful to meet 
with the courageous Ukrainian delega-
tion, led by Mykyta Poturaiev, which 
appreciates President Trump’s pro-
viding Javelin missiles to stop Russian 
aggression. 
Bulgaria was well-represented, with a 
delegation led by Desislava Atanasova. 
Today, America celebrates Bulgarian 
National 
Day 
with 
Ambassador 
Tihomir Stoychev at the Library of 
Congress across the street in Wash-
ington. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MILLER MIDDLE 
SCHOOL’S EIGHTH GRADE CLASS 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, 
today I am here on behalf of the people 
of Nevada’s Third Congressional Dis-
trict, and I rise to recognize the Miller 
Middle School eighth grade class, with 
whom I met earlier this week on their 
trip to Washington—and the timing 
couldn’t be better since it is Public 
Schools Week. 
We talked about topics from STEM 
education to encouraging creativity in 
the classroom. They had some terrific 
questions, but one really stuck out. 
One student asked me: Is investing in 
public education really worth it? 
It is a tough question, a fair ques-
tion, especially coming from a Clark 
County student. But the answer for me 
is overwhelmingly, undoubtedly yes. I 
just had to look around that room and 
see each of those students, whether 
they came from different backgrounds, 
having access to education. 
And the answer is not just about in-
vesting, but it is about if we invest in 
public education as the national pri-
ority that it should be. In a time when 
public schools are being called upon to 
help kids beyond the classroom, invest-
ment in education should be our na-
tional priority. 
f 
RECOGNIZING COLONEL GUION 
‘‘GUY’’ BLUFORD 
(Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, today I rise to recognize Westlake, 
Ohio, resident Colonel Guion ‘‘Guy’’ 
Bluford, who received the Ohio Distin-
guished Service Medal last week. 
Guy became the first African Amer-
ican astronaut to travel into space in 
1983. He earned the Ohio Distinguished 
Service Medal, the highest noncombat 
decoration for service awarded by the 
State, for his commitment and dedica-
tion throughout his historic career in 
aviation. 
Before joining NASA, Bluford flew 
over 144 combat missions with the 
United States Air Force in South Viet-
nam. He later went on to earn his mas-
ter’s and doctorate degree with aero-
space engineering at the Air Force In-
stitute of Technology at Wright-Pat-
terson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. 
We are proud and eternally grateful 
for Bluford’s military service and dedi-
cation to space exploration. As NASA 
looks to expand mankind’s horizons in 
space, his life achievements and avia-
tion accomplishments serve as an in-
spiration to future generations. 
f 
AMERICANS SHOULD KNOW HOW 
MUCH 
OUR 
HEALTHCARE 
IS 
GOING TO COST 
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
MALINOWSKI. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today I introduced a fully bipartisan 
healthcare bill, the Know the Price 
Act. It says something very simple 
that I am confident we will agree on: 
Americans should know how much our 
healthcare is going to cost before we 
receive it. 
Many Americans aren’t aware that, 
when we go to a healthcare provider, 
there is often a gag clause, a gag clause 
in the contracts between providers and 
insurers that blocks us from seeing the 
cost and quality of the care we are 
about to receive. My bill eliminates 
these gag clauses so that we have the 
power and the freedom to make in-
formed decisions about our healthcare. 
The bill would also allow employers 
to access deidentified claims data, con-
sistent with the Privacy Act, so that 
they have the information they need to 
choose the healthcare plans that are 
actually best for their employees. 
Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense 
legislation that will offer families and 
businesses in New Jersey and all across 
our country more choice in their 
healthcare at lower prices. 
f 
MEASURES 
TO 
COMBAT 
ROBOCALLS 
COMING 
FROM 
ABROAD 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to discuss an ongoing issue that has af-
fected nearly every American: the bar-
rage 
of 
annoying 
and 
deceptive 
robocalls. 
These seemingly endless automated 
phone calls disrupt our daily lives; 
they constitute a serious form of har-
assment and expose millions of Ameri-
cans to dangerous financial scams. 
That is why I introduced a bipartisan 
bill, alongside my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives 
LACY
CLAY
and 
DAN 
BISHOP, called the Foreign Robocall 
Elimination Act. Our bill takes on 
robocalls that originate overseas by di-
recting the FCC to convene an inter-
agency task force to develop effective 
measures to combat robocalls coming 
from abroad. 
No matter which side of the aisle we 
find ourselves on, we should all be able 
to agree: It is time for these illegal 
robocalls to be stopped once and for all. 
f 
KEEP US SAFE FROM 
CORONAVIRUS 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, the 
American people deserve a coordinated, 
fully funded response to keep us safe 
from the coronavirus. But instead of 
taking the situation seriously, the 
President has mounted a confusing and 
chaotic response. 
He designated MIKE PENCE to lead the 
public health response, MIKE PENCE, a 
man whose terrible public health po-
lices as Governor of Indiana allowed 
the worst HIV epidemic in the State’s 
history to take root in 2015. 
The President’s budget earlier this 
month slashed almost $700 million from 
the CDC. He has left vacant critical po-
sitions 
responsible 
for 
managing 
pandemics, and now he has proposed 
raiding funds that were appropriated 
by Congress for other life-threatening 
public health emergencies. 
To be blunt, the President’s response 
has been a disaster. 
The American people deserve better, 
and that is why the House will advance

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL PROTEIN 
DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
National Protein Day. Protein is one of 
the most important elements of a 
healthy diet. 
In turn, I would also like to recognize 
one of the most important sources of 
protein in the American diet. I am 
talking about milk. 
We know that the protein in milk 
helps build and repair muscle tissue in 
active bodies. Additionally, dairy prod-
ucts like milk contain nine essential 
nutrients that help reduce the risk of 
high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and 
certain cancers. Milk also supports 
strong bones and a healthy immune 
system. 
Despite all these positive qualities, 
milk consumption in the United States 
has been on the decline. In an effort to 
reverse this trend, I introduced the 
Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act last 
year, a bipartisan bill, to once again 
allow whole milk in our Nation’s 
schools. 
Milk is part of a nutritious and 
healthy diet, packed with protein and 
flavor. This National Protein Day, I 
would like to remind us all of the nu-
trients and health benefits that whole 
milk provides.

PHILADELPHIA’S MOST 
DISTINGUISHED WARD LEADERS 
(Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Penn-
sylvania asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute 
and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, in commemoration 
of Black History Month, I am honored 
to be joined by six of Philadelphia’s 
most distinguished ward leaders and 
want to ensure that their contributions 
to our city remain enshrined in our 
historical CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for 
future generations to recognize. 
Ms. El Amor M. Brawne Ali of Ward 
37, Mr. Arthur Green of Ward 14, Shir-
ley Gregory of Ward 49, Peter Lyde of 
Ward 61, Renee McNear of Ward 20, and 
Sharon Vaughn of Ward 42 all take 
after the long lineage of Philadelphians 
who advanced our democracy towards 
an increasingly inclusive system. 
Mr. Speaker, I extend to them our 
most sincere gratitude for their leader-
ship on behalf of our shared constitu-
encies and look forward to honoring 
them here at the Capitol later this 
afternoon.

COMBATING THE SUBSTANCE 
ABUSE EPIDEMIC 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, the 
opioid crisis has had a devastating im-
pact on communities throughout our 
country. In my conversations with 
members of law enforcement, public 
safety officials, and public health ex-
perts, it has become clear that serious 
reforms are necessary to ensure our 
criminal 
justice 
system 
effectively 
contributes to efforts to combat the 
substance abuse epidemic. 
The 2018 National Institute on Drug 
Abuse data shows that every day, 128 
people in the United States die from an 
overdose of opioids. The misuse of and 
addiction to opioids, including pre-
scription pain relievers, heroin, and 
synthetic opioids such as fentanyl is a 
severe national crisis that affects pub-
lic health, as well as social and eco-
nomic welfare. 
Next month, I am going to hold a 
roundtable discussion on this issue in 
my district to learn best practices and 
ensure that our stakeholders stem the 
tide before it becomes a crisis in our 
community. I am going to use the 
measures that my Democratic col-
leagues instituted to bring that to our 
community to make sure that it does 
not happen in the Virgin Islands.

HONORING DENNIS HOOD 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a 
friend of mine who passed away a few 
days ago. His name is Dennis Hood. 
Dennis lived in public housing and 
has been a fierce advocate for imple-
mentation of the Section 3 program. 
Despite the many illnesses that Dennis 
had, he developed himself a small con-
tracting business, worked it well, but 
unfortunately passed away. 
Mr. Speaker, I salute Dennis for his 
efforts to advocate for those low-in-
come residents who live in public hous-
ing.

HONORING DR. MOHAMMAD 
KHALID 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor my constituent, 
Dr. Mohammad Khalid, a man who 
truly embodies the American Dream. 
Dr. Khalid came here from Pakistan

eral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with re-
spect to the sale and marketing of tobacco 
products, and for other purposes. All points 
of order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. In lieu of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute recommended by the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce now 
printed in the bill, an amendment in the na-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1234 
February 27, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, on 
Wednesday, the Rules Committee met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
866, providing for the consideration of 
H.R. 2339, Protecting American Lungs 
and Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epi-
demic Act of 2020 under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 90 minutes of de-
bate equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and the ranking member of 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce and the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the Committee on Ways and 
Means. The rule self-executes a man-
ager’s amendment to make technical 
corrections and provides one motion to 
recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the bill in this rule. 
Mr. Speaker, as our Nation antici-
pates the probability of a pandemic, 
here today in the people’s House we 
have the opportunity to save almost 
six million young lives that would be 
cut short by nicotine if we fail to act. 
I am not exaggerating. The CDC has 
predicted that if the children of our 
country continue to use tobacco prod-
ucts at the current rate, 5.6 million 
children will have premature deaths. 
This is a test of our courage. Let’s 
look at the facts: 
In 1997, 24.6 percent of all 12th grad-
ers reported daily use of cigarettes, and 
36.5 percent reported some use in the 
past 30 days. Thanks to smart, tough 
policies and a national commitment to 
reduce cigarette use by children, those 
numbers dropped to 3.6 percent and 7.6 
percent by 2018. 
Nearly 90 percent of adult smokers 
began smoking before the age of 18. If 
you do not start smoking as a child, it 
is very unlikely you will smoke as an 
adult. This is not a secret. Public 
health officials know this, and tobacco 
companies know this, too. They also 
know that nicotine is a highly addict-
ive substance. 
This dramatic reduction in cigarette 
use by children put tobacco companies 
in a bind. If children and teenagers 
have stopped using cigarettes, and 90 
percent of all adult smokers began 
smoking as children, how can they 
maintain their pipeline of customers? 
Their answer arrived in the form of a 
new 
technology, 
e-cigarettes 
and 
vaping products. Companies knew that 
the pipeline of lifetime smokers was 
dwindling, so they started marketing 
new vaping products to young people 
through Instagram ads and influencers 
and other social media platforms. They 
also handed out free vaping products at 
music events and movies. They clearly 
targeted children, our children, and 
their strategy worked. 
Today, 26.7 percent of 12th graders 
vaped in the last month. This rate has 
more than doubled in the last 2 years 
alone. In 2010, only 1.5 percent of 12th 
graders reported vaping. 
We banned flavored cigarettes in 2009 
because they appealed to children and 
encouraged them to take up smoking. 
Tobacco companies switched to fla-
vored 
vape 
products 
and 
flavored 
cigarillos because these products are 
not held to the same standard, even 
though they are tobacco products and 
contain nicotine. 
In 2018, 67 percent of high school stu-
dents and 49 percent of middle school 
students who used tobacco products in 
the past 30 days reported using a fla-
vored tobacco product. 
So while kids can’t buy cotton candy 
or banana smash cigarettes, they can 
buy those flavors in vaping products or 
in cigarillos. 
For the record, nicotine has health 
effects beyond addiction. Nicotine ex-
posure damages adolescent brain devel-
opment, and brains are not fully done 
developing until the mid-20s. Nicotine 
also contributes to the hardening of ar-
terial walls, which in turn, may lead to 
a cardiac event. 
It is time, Mr. Speaker, to ensure our 
children do not face a lifetime of nico-
tine addiction. It is time to finally pass 
a bill that protects their health, and 
that is what the Protecting American 
Lungs and Reversing the Youth To-
bacco Epidemic Act will do. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
SHALALA) for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to the rule providing for the con-
sideration of H.R. 2339, the Protecting 
American Lungs and Reversing the 
Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019. 
This bill is a misnomer. It is not aimed 
at curbing youth tobacco or e-cigarette 
use, it is aimed at tobacco generally. 
Both parties in the House and Senate 
agreed that we needed to act in order 
to prevent youth access to these prod-
ucts. In December, we fulfilled that 
commitment by sending a bill to the 
President’s desk, which he signed, that 
raised the legal age to purchase all to-
bacco products to 21 years of age. 
President Trump signed what has been 
termed ‘‘T21‘‘ into law on December 20 
of 2019. 
This policy will break down youth 
access through social networks in 
schools where 18-year olds could pur-
chase tobacco products legally and 
then disseminate those products to 
younger students. 
Other significant efforts such as the 
flavor ban by the Trump administra-
tion will help limit youth tobacco use. 
The Food and Drug Administration has 
issued a ban on flavored e-cigarette 
products that appeal to children, in-
cluding fruit and mint flavors. This 
ban will help deter youth use in the fu-
ture and prevent companies from tar-
geting children with appealing flavors. 
When we first held a hearing on the 
vaping lung injury at the start of the 
outbreak back in October, the cause of 
this lung injury was unclear, however, 
these lung injuries were disproportion-
ately affecting the young population. 
After diligent efforts by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention and 
State health departments, we have 
since found that the vast majority of 
these lung injuries were caused by 
tetrahydrocannabinol and the vaping 
products containing vitamin E acetate, 
an additive. 
b 1230 
Let me point out that none of these 
products are legal, and children are 
buying them on the black market. 
An article from National Public 
Radio, published September 27, 2019, ti-
tled ‘‘Many Vaping Illnesses Linked to 
Black Market ‘Dank Vapes’ or Other 
THC Products,’’ walks through how 
two brothers in Wisconsin were ar-
rested for running a THC vape ring. 
Captain Mike Martin of the Waynes-
boro Police Department in Virginia 
said that these products are labeled 
‘‘Dank Vapes’’ and ‘‘appear commer-
cially packaged, and there are a vari-
ety of different flavors.’’ His police de-
partment has recovered $35,000 worth of 
vaping products. 
At this point, Madam Speaker, I 
think it is worthwhile to point out it is 
probably not a good idea for anyone to 
take into their lungs something that is 
labeled ‘‘Dank Vapes.’’ 
According to the CDC, ‘‘Dank Vapes 
appears to be the most prominent in a 
class of largely counterfeit brands, 
with common packaging that is easily 
available online and that is used by 
distributors to market THC-containing 
cartridges.’’ 
H.R. 2339 does absolutely nothing to 
crack down on that black market. 
These deliciously named vaping prod-
ucts, with flavors such as lemon 
slushie, bubble gum, and sour diesel, 
will likely continue to be sold illegally, 
especially online. 
The Trump administration has al-
ready released guidance to ban flavors. 
The Food and Drug Administration is 
requiring companies to stop the manu-
facture, distribution, and sale of cer-
tain unauthorized flavored e-cigarette 
products within 30 days of their pub-
lished guidance. This guidance took ef-
fect on February 6, 2020, and is now in 
effect and enforceable. 
This bill takes the flavor ban further 
and bans all flavored tobacco products, 
including menthol. This will take fla-
vored cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless 
tobacco away from law-abiding adults, 
who must now, by law, be 21 years of 
age to purchase any tobacco product. 
Additionally, this bill contains a po-
tential 
infringement 
on 
the 
First 
Amendment by requiring health warn-
ings on cigarette labels and adver-
tising. There are other ways to educate 
individuals, particularly our young 
population, of the harmful effects of 
smoking without impinging on freedom 
of speech. 
Congress has already taken steps to 
protect our young people from a future 
of tobacco addiction when we passed 
Tobacco 21, and the Trump administra-
tion has stepped up and banned fla-
vored e-cigarette products. The House

also passed H.R. 3942, the Preventing 
Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Chil-
dren Act, which requires age verifica-
tion by all retailers at the time of sale 
and delivery. 
These policies will prevent young 
people from accessing e-cigarettes and 
will deter future use. On the other 
hand, H.R. 2339 does not address youth 
tobacco use. This bill would ban all fla-
vored tobacco products from all ages, 
taking away choices for law-abiding 
adult Americans. 
So, let’s be clear. Tobacco is not 
healthy; however, law-abiding adults 
are capable of making these decisions 
for themselves. 
Traditional cigarettes remain the 
leading cause of preventable death in 
the United States, claiming an esti-
mated 480,000 lives or more each year. 
This is a personal issue for me, as I lost 
both parents to tobacco-related dis-
ease. 
Now, according to the CDC, an esti-
mated 34 million adults in the United 
States currently smoke cigarettes, and 
more than 16 million Americans live 
with a smoking-related disease. 
While I am certainly concerned about 
the effect of e-cigarettes on our young 
people, we do need to remember that 
there is a large adult population with a 
whole host of health problems related 
to tobacco. Some early studies show 
that current adult tobacco users may 
benefit from the less harmful alter-
native that e-cigarettes pose. 
Additionally, the adult population 
will seek out alternatives if their to-
bacco product of choice is eliminated 
from the legal market. A bill like this 
that makes illegal the products used by 
many Americans could contribute to 
an already existing and thriving black 
market for tobacco products. 
As we saw last year, the outbreak of 
lung injuries was linked to counterfeit 
and black market products. There were 
reports of illicit operations by individ-
uals taking THC vape cartridges and 
cutting the product with other oils to 
maximize their profit. 
If H.R. 2339 becomes law, it could in-
spire similar black market operations 
to create products that law-abiding 
Americans currently enjoy. 
This bill is not about youth use of 
vaping products. It is about elimi-
nating all adult use of tobacco prod-
ucts. 
We have seen a surge of lung injuries 
in the United States, an issue that is 
not adequately addressed in this bill. 
The Centers for Disease Control has 
linked these injuries to THC products, 
not tobacco. 
Protecting our youth from tobacco is 
an important priority. However, H.R. 
2339 does not do that, and it goes too 
far. Therefore, I cannot support it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
oppose the bill, oppose the rule that de-
livers the bill, and oppose this assault 
on free choice for the American people. 
Madam Speaker, with opposition to 
the rule, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume, and let me simply say we can 
never go too far when we are pro-
tecting our children. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a February 5 NBC News article 
titled ‘‘Federal flavor ban goes into ef-
fect Thursday, but many flavored vape 
products will still be available.’’ 
[From NBC News, Feb. 5, 2020] 
FEDERAL
FLAVOR
BAN
GOES
INTO
EFFECT 
THURSDAY, 
BUT
MANY
FLAVORED
VAPE 
PRODUCTS WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE 
(By Erika Edwards) 
A nationwide ban on many flavored e-ciga-
rette products goes into effect Thursday, but 
teenagers will still have access to nicotine 
vapes, experts say. 
The ban covers a number of kid-friendly 
flavorings, such as mint and fruit, though 
menthol and tobacco flavorings will remain 
legal. However, the ban only applies to spe-
cific types of devices: cartridge or pre-filled 
pod devices, like the ones made popular by 
Juul. All other devices will be left on the 
market. 
But limiting access to Juul, which stopped 
selling all non-menthol and tobacco flavored 
pods in November, is unlikely to have much 
of an effect on teens already addicted to nic-
otine. 
‘‘Kids have moved on,’’ Meredith Berkman, 
co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-ciga-
rettes, or PAVE, told NBC News. 
Teenagers know that teachers are now edu-
cated about how to detect vaping in class-
rooms, she said. So they’re getting their nic-
otine fix in other ways, including products 
not covered by the looming ban. 
‘‘Kids are sucking on flavored nicotine 
pouches to get through the day until they 
can get home to their device,’’ Berkman 
said. The pouches are reminiscent of chewing 
tobacco, but are advertised as being ‘‘to-
bacco-free.’’ 
Experts in teen addiction also said there’s 
plenty of evidence that teens now favor high-
ly concentrated, refillable nicotine vape 
products called Smok and Suorin Drops as 
well as cheaper, disposable vape pods called 
Puff Bars—also to be left on the market 
after Thursday. 
‘‘I’m not very optimistic,’’ Bonnie Halpern- 
Felsher, a professor at Stanford University 
who studies teen vaping, said. ‘‘We really do 
need to have enforcement of the law across 
all tobacco products, regardless of these 
loopholes.’’ 
‘‘The new policy does not solve the prob-
lem,’’ Matthew Myers, president of the Cam-
paign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said, adding 
parents need to keep their guard up and edu-
cate their teenagers about the harms of nico-
tine addiction. ‘‘Millions of flavored prod-
ucts will remain available.’’ 
Plans for restricting e-cigarette flavors on 
a federal level first came up in September, 
when key national data on teen vaping was 
released. It was revealed that from 2017 to 
2019, rates of vaping had more than doubled 
among 8th, 10th and 12th grade students. 
New cases of those lung illnesses have de-
clined considerably since then. As of Jan. 21 
(the latest data available), the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention reports that 
there have been 2,711 cases of people who’ve 
been hospitalized with EVALI, or e-ciga-
rette, or vaping, product use-associated lung 
injury. 
All 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., have 
reported EVALI cases. Sixty people have 
died. Many others were left with lasting lung 
damage. 
Investigations suggested most cases were 
not associated with vaping nicotine, but in-
stead THC, the psychoactive ingredient 
found in marijuana. Most of those THC vapes 
came from drug dealers or friends. Vitamin E 
oil has been the leading culprit in the lung 
damage, though other chemicals and addi-
tives can’t be ruled out, according to the 
CDC. 
After Thursday, companies that make any 
vape products—including those covered in 
the ban—will have to meet a May 12 deadline 
to apply to the Food and Drug Administra-
tion to continue selling their products. 
It will take one year for the FDA to review 
those applications, during which time prod-
ucts can, and likely will, remain on the mar-
ket. 
‘‘It’s not a ‘forever’ ban,’’ Halpern-Felsher 
said. ‘‘We have a long way to go.’’ 
Ms. 
SHALALA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
many teens today have moved from 
using flavored e-cigarettes to other fla-
vored nicotine-laced products. That in-
cludes things like flavored pouches, 
drops, and pods. 
These products are still on the mar-
ket today. The recent national ban, 
which my distinguished colleague re-
ferred to, didn’t take them off the 
shelves. Something more is needed to 
make sure our children don’t go from 
one bad addictive product to the next. 
The products might be different, but 
the impacts are the same. It is a dis-
tinction without a difference, Madam 
Speaker. 
That is why we have to pass this bill 
to keep life-threatening products out of 
the hands of our children. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to support the rule and this com-
prehensive legislation, which prohibits 
all flavored tobacco products. 
Madam Speaker, I commend Chair-
man FRANK
PALLONE
and Congress-
woman DONNA SHALALA for their lead-
ership. 
The youth vaping epidemic is a pub-
lic health emergency that threatens 
our youngsters. According to the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, one in four high schoolers are 
using e-cigarettes, and not just occa-
sionally. More than a third of users in 
high school said that they were smok-
ing e-cigarettes at least 20 days a 
month. 
My granddaughter, who is a high 
schooler, when I asked her about this, 
she said it is everywhere, that every-
one is smoking e-cigarettes. 
Last year, I hosted a hearing on the 
youth vaping crisis in the Labor, 
Health and Human Services, and Edu-
cation Subcommittee. As experts have 
said, the flavors are a key factor in 
this. Seven out of 10 current youth e- 
cigarette users said that they used e- 
cigarettes because ‘‘they come in fla-
vors I like.’’ 
Nearly all, or 97 percent, had used a 
flavored e-cigarette in the past month. 
Mango, 
mint, 
cotton 
candy, 
and 
gummy bears are just some of the 
15,000 flavors still available, thanks to 
the loophole-laden action the Trump 
administration took in January. 
The President made a promise in the 
Oval Office to American families to

ban flavors, which are hooking our 
youngsters. They are becoming ad-
dicted. But special interests appear to 
be more important. He allowed popular 
flavors like menthol to remain for 
products like the popular Juul device. 
He allowed disposable vapes of all fla-
vors to remain on the market. 
It is unacceptable. The health of our 
children must be our priority. So, the 
Democratic majority of the United 
States House of Representatives is 
stepping up for our children by voting 
for this bill and this rule. We can ban 
flavors and take comprehensive action 
to defend our kids. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote for the rule and the 
bill. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 1 minute. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an article from The Hill today, 
written by YVETTE CLARKE, making a 
point 
about 
the 
unintended 
con-
sequences of this legislation. 
The bill carves out an exemption for 
certain cigar products, but it also cre-
ates a ban on menthol products, which 
would 
have 
the 
unintended 
con-
sequence of adversely and selectively 
affecting individuals, tobacco users, in 
communities of color.

YOUTH
TOBACCO
USE
LEGISLATION
WOULD 
HAVE
UNINTENDED
LIFE-OR-DEATH
CON-
SEQUENCES FOR BLACK TOBACCO USERS 
(By Rep. Yvette D. Clarke) 
This week marks a critical, life-changing 
moment for the black community, specifi-
cally for black tobacco users. The Reversing 
the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act (H.R. 2339) 
is set for a vote this week in the House of 
Representatives, and while this bill seem-
ingly makes a lot of sense in curbing youth 
tobacco use, there are some glaring unin-
tended dire consequences for communities of 
color with this legislation. 
H.R. 2339 does many things with the goal 
to reduce youth tobacco use, like providing 
resources for a substantive public awareness 
campaign to educate about the dangers of to-
bacco use and reducing access to online pur-
chases of flavored tobacco products. How-
ever, this legislation does not treat all to-
bacco products equally, carving out an ex-
emption for one flavored product, premium 
cigars preferred by white smokers. A ban 
that makes an exception for one flavor—pre-
mium cigars—while banning menthol puts 
black lives at risk. Let me explain. 
Considering the fact that 90 percent of 
black smokers use menthol products, men-
thol tobacco users would live in fear of new 
stop and frisk opportunities under this legis-
lation, because menthol would now be con-
sidered an illegal flavor. A ban that targets 
menthol products but ignores other premium 
tobacco products unduly burdens the black 
community. This asymmetrical ban feels 
more like a targeted attack than a value- 
neutral health care policy decision. In effect, 
white adult smokers would see little dif-
ference in their lives after this ban while 
black smokers could face even more sweep-
ing harassment from law enforcement if the 
hint of menthol smoke can justify a stop. 
Make no mistake, banning all electronic 
and combustible tobacco products would 
save lives and while the premise of this legis-
lation to address the uptick in youth tobacco 
use is positive, we cannot support an asym-
metrical ban that disproportionately endan-
gers the black community. 
While the debate has not made this clear, 
we are unfortunately not currently consid-
ering a ban on all tobacco products. In fact, 
we are not even debating a uniform ban on 
vaping products or combustible cigarettes. 
Instead, the ban would focus solely on fla-
vored tobacco products, including menthol. 
Considering how often teenagers develop 
smoking habits after starting with flavored 
products, I understand why the Energy and 
Commerce Committee has focused on this 
issue. However, including menthol in the fla-
vored products ban will disproportionately 
imperil the black community putting them 
at increased risk of additional over-policing. 
I do not take this position lightly, but as 
an elected official I must make the hard de-
cisions—not the easy ones. I have a responsi-
bility, to my constituents and the Constitu-
tion, to be the voice of the marginalized 
among us. To do so, I worked with the com-
mittee to find solutions to the criminal jus-
tice concerns of my community but was ulti-
mately rebuffed. Nonetheless, I introduced 
an amendment promoting an education pro-
gram to increase awareness about the dan-
gers of tobacco use and the implications of 
this legislation. Constructive efforts like 
this will make considerable headway towards 
reducing tobacco use without laying the 
foundation for disparate enforcement of a 
ban. 
While I would love to assume the best in-
tentions of all involved parties and hope for 
the best in regard to enforcement, lived ex-
perience demands caution. In the world cre-
ated by this asymmetrical ban where men-
thol tobacco products provide justification 
for police stops, I fear that we would have 
handed law enforcement another excuse to 
harass, 
detain 
and 
otherwise 
endanger 
marginalized communities. Despite the clear 
health benefits of this ban, I cannot in good 
conscious expose already vulnerable commu-
nities to this risk. 
As a duly elected representative of Brook-
lyn, it would be an abdication of duty to dis-
regard our painful history of over-policing or 
to ignore the very real potential of this his-
tory repeating itself. While no one would 
enjoy the political pressure this has exposed, 
I cannot ignore my nightmares of a jumped 
turnstile and a loosie turning into a far more 
serious matter of life and death potentially 
creating an additional health crisis. As Eric 
Garner’s mother knows all too well, and re-
layed in a letter to the New York delegation 
regarding this ban, in New York a single cig-
arette can become a death sentence. 
If the committee decides to improve this 
bill by making it a categorical ban on to-
bacco products, I will throw my full support 
behind the effort. When I asked for a carve 
out for menthol products, similar to the 
carve out that was granted for the on line 
sales of premium tobacco products like the 
Cuban cigars favored by Wall Street execu-
tives, I was soundly rebuffed. I would proud-
ly support a categorical tobacco ban, but the 
committee so far has denied this oppor-
tunity. Nonetheless, and regardless of the 
political pressures, I will continue to do ev-
erything in my power to protect the people 
of the 9th District of New York and all black 
tobacco users across America. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to clar-
ify some misunderstandings related to 
the bill that I have just heard. 
Some have suggested that H.R. 2339 
allows certain cigars to be exempt 
from the flavor prohibition. 
I want to be very clear. Under this 
legislation, all tobacco products are 
subject to the flavor prohibition, in-
cluding cigars. In fact, the text of the 
definition of cigar product explicitly 
states that these cigars cannot contain 
a characterizing flavor. Under the leg-
islation, menthol is a characterizing 
flavor. 
The only way to tackle the youth to-
bacco epidemic is to prohibit all fla-
vors in all products, which is exactly 
what H.R. 2339 does. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
DESAULNIER), a distinguished member 
of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
and for her leadership on issues of pub-
lic health, particularly this bill. 
I rise in support of the Reversing the 
Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act. 
I am proud of the long history in the 
San Francisco Bay Area, which I have 
been privileged to represent and live in 
for many years, starting in the 1980s 
with the amazing work by Stan Glantz, 
a researcher in San Francisco who dis-
covered 
the 
tobacco 
industry 
was 
pathologically lying to the American 
public and hiding the effects of their 
products. 
We responded to that by trying to 
pass laws here in Congress, but we were 
unable to because of the tobacco lobby. 
We tried State legislative opportuni-
ties but failed to do that. But in local 
government, we passed hundreds of 
local ordinances banning secondhand 
smoke to protect employees and to pro-
tect customers. 
At the time, I was a member of the 
California Restaurant Association and 
a restaurant owner. Many of my col-
leagues were part of the same argu-
ments we hear today, that you will put 
retailers out of business, that this is 
all legal product. 
We listened to those, and we enacted 
these laws, and we worked with people 
who were affected by it. The economic 
impacts were positive, not negative. 
Restaurants are more successful than 
they have ever been in the bay area. 
We lead the country in many ways. 
When we passed these ordinances, 
public health people came together 
with labor and others to make sure 
that the truth came out. 
In the early 1990s, as the mayor of a 
city of 130,000 people, Concord, Cali-
fornia, I authored one of the first ef-
forts in the Nation to curb secondhand 
smoke. In fact, it has been illegal to 
smoke in bars, restaurants, and other 
public places in California entirely 
since 1998. 
We worked together then to stop Big 
Tobacco’s hold over millions of ad-
dicted Americans, and we won. 
Unfortunately, Big Tobacco has a 
new partner, the vaping industry. Com-
panies 
like 
Juul, 
unfortunately 
headquartered in San Francisco, in my 
view, represent the very worst of the 
bay area business culture. They don’t 
ask for permission. They apologize

after they have addicted millions of 
Americans, particularly young people. 
They deceptively and illegally mar-
keted their poisonous products to chil-
dren, much like Big Tobacco did dec-
ades ago. 
Our efforts led to an almost 70 per-
cent decrease in the use of tobacco 
products across the country, according 
to the Centers for Disease Control. 
In 2016 alone, on the other hand, 7 out 
of 10 U.S. middle and high school stu-
dents saw e-cigarette ads on TV, in 
stores, and online. 
With 
marketing 
campaigns 
that 
make vaping look safe and fun, they 
use flavors like cotton candy to attract 
young people to try vaping and get 
hooked on nicotine. 
But we know better. We have a long 
history of this. These products are not 
safe. They are not smoking-cessation 
devices. And we need to take action to 
protect our children, just as we did 
years ago. 
b 1245 
In local government in the bay area, 
we have started to do what we did in 
the 1990s: passing bans on these prod-
ucts. So, if we won’t do it here, we will 
do it at a local level; but we should do 
it here, and we should pass this bill. 
The longer we wait, millions are ad-
dicted, and millions more are being 
targeted. The Reversing the Youth To-
bacco Epidemic Act will help save lives 
and keep widespread nicotine addiction 
in the past in the United States. 
We beat Big Tobacco once before, and 
we can do it again. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. CURTIS). 
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the rule underlying 
the bill. 
Reducing the alarming rate of youth 
e-cigarette use is and must remain a 
top priority for public health officials 
and lawmakers. Our children are the 
future of our country, and my greatest 
joy in this life has been watching my 
children grow into the men and women 
that they are today. 
Protecting their health and safety 
and of that their children in order to 
ensure their future success is, person-
ally, a top priority of mine in Congress. 
However, H.R. 2339, the bill before us 
today, is concerning for numerous rea-
sons. 
First, this one-size-fits-all bill was 
drafted without Republican input. The 
committee of jurisdiction passed the 
legislation virtually along partisan 
lines. 
This legislation was finalized just 
Monday night but is receiving a vote 
this week, with details negotiated out-
side of public view. A bill of this mag-
nitude, which includes over $100 mil-
lion in new taxes, deserves a lengthy 
public debate. 
Second, 
Congress recently passed 
needed legislation to raise the min-
imum age to purchase tobacco products 
from 18 to 21 on a bipartisan basis. 
Additionally, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration already has the ability to 
regulate flavored e-cigarette products, 
and this bill would permanently under-
mine ongoing efforts to combat youth 
vaping by the FDA. 
Most importantly, this bill would un-
dercut ongoing efforts by the State of 
Utah to combat youth vaping. The 
Utah Legislature and Governor’s office 
acted decisively to keep these products 
out of the hands of our youth and are 
considering additional steps to protect 
the welfare of our kids. The State of 
Utah is a great example of what we can 
accomplish when partisanship is put 
aside for the greater good. 
In closing, I want to reiterate the im-
portance of keeping these products out 
of the hands of children. But we can’t 
do that without a lengthier, bipartisan 
conversation, and especially if we are 
ignoring the work State and local gov-
ernments have been doing to keep our 
children safe. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 1 minute. 
Madam Speaker, I will include in the 
RECORD a letter from Mothers of the 
Movement. They state, in part: ‘‘We 
ask that, at the same time you con-
sider health issues, you look carefully 
at the criminal justice impact of such 
a change in health policy. Our commu-
nity has had plenty of experience living 
under laws passed with the best of in-
tentions. Under your bill, cigarettes 
preferred by African Americans would 
be illegal; cigarettes preferred by non- 
African Americans would be legal.’’ 
MOTHERS OF THE MOVEMENT, 
Miami Gardens, FL, October 11, 2019. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, 
Chairman, House Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: We appreciate 
your focus on reviewing the health effects of 
tobacco and e-cigarettes in young people. We 
urge you to pay very close attention to the 
unintended effects of a ban on menthol ciga-
rettes and what it would mean in the Urban 
community. 
We both strive hard to do our best and set 
examples in our community amongst the 
black youth. Our focus is within various cit-
ies throughout the country. We have wit-
nessed encounters with law enforcement and 
negative policing which has been spread 
throughout our community. 
H.R. 2339, the Reversing the Youth Tobacco 
Epidemic Act, contains a provision that bans 
menthol cigarettes. We are concerned of the 
rising numbers of Black Americans who pre-
fer menthol cigarettes. We are alarmed that 
80% Black Americans in Urban communities 
invest in purchasing of these good. As a re-
sult of this ban, we recognize the effects 
which may happen within the Urban commu-
nity and the justice system. 
We do not encourage, support, or promote 
smoking especially in our Urban commu-
nities. We are concerned that this ban in 
many cases will reintroduce another version 
of stop-and-frisk in black low socio-economic 
communities. We experience and are forced 
to tolerate aggressive behaviors from law en-
forcement. This is our reality and is dis-
played throughout different levels of govern-
ment, locally and nationally daily. This ban 
will introduce or replay many hard to em-
ploy young black Americans to the criminal 
justice system. We do not want to take par-
ents, sons, and daughters out of households 
for small infractions that carry financial ob-
ligations. We ask that, at the same time you 
consider health issues, you look carefully at 
the criminal justice impact of such a change 
in health policy. Our community has had 
plenty of experience living under laws passed 
with the best of intentions. Under your bill, 
cigarettes preferred by African-Americans 
would be illegal; cigarettes preferred by non- 
African-Americans would be legal. 
Small violations can quickly escalate to 
consequential events. We refuse to witness 
another mother join us in death of a loved 
one because of readily available products and 
decisions available in our Black commu-
nities 
Best Regards, 
GWENDOLYN CARR, 
Mother of Eric Garner. 
SYBRINA FULTON, 
Mother 
of 
Trayvon 
Martin. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, if 
we defeat the previous question, I will 
offer an amendment to the rule to im-
mediately bring up a resolution con-
demning the comments of Democratic 
Socialist Presidential candidate BER-
NARD SANDERS. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of this 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEGETTE). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, to 
explain this amendment, I yield 5 min-
utes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DIAZ-BALART). 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, 
I urge defeat of the previous question 
so that we can amend, as the gen-
tleman just explained the rule, to im-
mediately consider my resolution con-
demning Senator SANDERS’ blatantly 
false comment regarding the racist, 
terrorist, murderous Castro regime in 
Cuba. 
I have said this before: If anybody 
wants to know the devastation of so-
cialism and the tyranny that so often 
accompanies it, I invite you to speak 
to some of my constituents, including 
thousands of former political prisoners 
now in exile. Let me just mention some 
of those. 
Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, ‘‘Antunez’’; 
Angel de Fana; and Roberto Martin 
Perez. There are so many others who 
are in south Florida who have suffered 
in the prisons of Cuba just because 
they have asked for and fought for free-
dom. 
But there are also former political 
prisoners who are still on the island, 
and I can mention many of them. Let 
me just mention Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet, 
who just recently was arrested, har-
assed, and then it looks like poten-
tially released; and the relatives of 
current political prisoners such as: 
Jose 
Daniel 
Ferrer, 
Mitzael 
Diaz 
Paseiro, Miguel Diaz Bauza, and Yanet 
Perez Quevedo. You can’t speak to

them because they are in prison cur-
rently, but you can speak to their rel-
atives. 
All of them have witnessed firsthand 
the destruction that socialism causes. 
All of these political prisoners have to 
be released at once. That is what we 
should be demanding. 
Now, unfortunately, this is not new 
coming from the Progressive move-
ment. But I remind Senator SANDERS 
and the Progressive movement that the 
Castro regime is not only a threat to 
the national security interests of the 
United States, but also to the democ-
racies in our hemisphere. 
I want to remind Senator SANDERS of 
the Cuba regime’s close relationship 
with some of the world’s worst thugs, 
such as Iran. Iran and the Cuban re-
gime held the first Iran-Cuban business 
forum in Tehran in August of 2019 and 
have signed memorandums of under-
standing affirming their commitment 
to expanded trade and coordination. 
There were, just recently, two high- 
profile visits of the Iranian so-called 
Foreign Minister and also the so-called 
President of Iran to Cuba in 2016. 
For years, the Cuban regime has been 
on the list of State Sponsors of Ter-
rorism for their support of other ter-
rorist states, terrorist organizations, 
and violence around the world and in 
this hemisphere. 
In 2013, the Cuban regime, I remind 
folks, was caught smuggling weapons 
to North Korea in the largest violation 
of international sanctions against that 
rogue regime. 
It has been propping up the Maduro 
regime with thousands of intelligence 
operatives to oppose the Venezuelan 
people and, in some cases, to kill the 
Venezuelan people. 
The Cuban regime has been harboring 
fugitives from U.S. justice, including 
FBI’s most wanted terrorist Joanne 
Chesimard and terrorist bomb maker 
William Morales. That is just to name 
a few. 
So that is why, Madam Speaker, I 
filed the resolution that condemns the 
blatantly false comments of Demo-
cratic Socialist candidate for President 
Senator BERNIE SANDERS. 
This resolution also rejects the false 
claims that Cuba’s healthcare, edu-
cation, and literacy rate have improved 
as a result of the Castro regime, the 
Castro dictatorship. Those claims have 
been debunked by numerous sources. 
Let me just go over a couple of facts. 
According to a State Department re-
port, Cuba’s infant mortality rate was 
32 of 1,000 live births, one of the best in 
the Western Hemisphere. But, Madam 
Speaker, this was not Castro. This is in 
the 1950s, pre-Castro. 
Cuba’s life expectancy was also one 
of the highest in Latin America in the 
1950s, pre-Castro. No, it wasn’t Castro. 
This was pre-Castro. 
Cuba’s literacy rate was one of the 
highest in the Western Hemisphere, 
pre-Castro in the 1950s. 
Those are the facts, Madam Speaker, 
the realities of Cuba. 
In Cuba now, over 1 million people— 
in a country of just 11 million—have 
risked everything to try to find free-
dom, to try to get away from that so-
cialist tyranny. Many have perished on 
rafts as they place themselves and 
their children at risk in shark-infested 
waters for just a chance at freedom. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Florida an 
additional 3 minutes. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, 
why would they do this if things in 
Cuba are just not all that bad? 
Again, in contrast, during the pre- 
Castro Cuba, more Americans were 
traveling to Cuba and going to Cuba 
than Cubans coming to the United 
States. 
Today, now, Madam Speaker, here we 
have an opportunity to condemn Sen-
ator BERNIE SANDERS’ blatantly false 
and hurtful comments regarding the 
racist, terrorist Castro regime. Join me 
in standing in solidarity with the 
Cuban people and, by extension, also 
solidarity with the Venezuelan people 
who are working to regain their free-
dom against what the OAS Secretary 
General has called the Cuban army of 
occupation in Venezuela. 
So join me in standing in solidarity 
with the people and not with the re-
gime that oppresses them. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, this bill claims to 
curb youth tobacco use, including 
vaping. The reality is it bans many 
types of tobacco products that are le-
gally and voluntarily used by adults. 
While I do not support any form of 
tobacco use, it is a choice for law-abid-
ing adults to make. The unintended 
consequences of suddenly making legal 
tobacco products illegal will likely 
push people to the black market to 
seek the same products—or worse. If 
we really want to address vaping, we 
need to target products containing 
tetrahydrocannabinol, THC. 
As I previously stated, we just re-
cently made tobacco use illegal for 
those under the age of 21, and the 
Trump administration has banned cer-
tain flavored e-cigarette products. 
This is a problem that requires a 
multilayered approach. Unfortunately, 
the provisions in this bill will not 
produce the desired result, and could 
even create more harm than good for 
some populations. 
Republicans do stand ready to work 
on bipartisan solutions to increase the 
health of our population and to protect 
our young people, but I need to urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question, a 
‘‘no’’ vote on the rule, and a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the underlying measure. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I am a little con-
fused. I may be a freshman, but I know 
that my good friend, MARIO
DIAZ- 
BALART, usually gives me a little ad-
vanced notice before he presents some-
thing. 
My Republican colleagues are prom-
ising that, if we defeat the previous 
question, they will bring up a resolu-
tion to condemn the terrible comments 
Senator SANDERS made regarding the 
dictator Fidel Castro. 
But let me be clear: Defeating the 
previous question means that Repub-
licans can bring up any germane bill or 
amendment they want. The key word 
here being ‘‘germane.’’ 
The resolution is not germane to the 
rule. That means, under the House 
rules, rules that have been in place 
since the founding of this institution, 
Republicans cannot bring to the floor 
the resolution they are promising to 
because it is not germane to the rule. 
The vote on the previous question is 
not a vote on the Diaz-Balart resolu-
tion. It is a vote to end debate on the 
rule and proceed to consideration of 
the legislation at hand, a bill to help 
prevent kids from taking up smoking. 
I am not disputing the merits of the 
resolution that my distinguished Re-
publican colleague is offering as the 
previous question. In fact, I support 
this resolution; and to be very clear, I 
have requested to be added as a cospon-
sor. I was the first Democratic Member 
of Congress to speak out against these 
misguided, ill-informed, hurtful, and 
unacceptable comments made by Sen-
ator SANDERS from Vermont. 
b 1300 
Over the last six decades, hundreds of 
thousands of Cubans have risked their 
lives to escape the tyranny of the Cas-
tro regime, a regime of fear, paranoia, 
and oppression that regularly abuses 
human rights in order to stifle free 
thought and democracy in Cuba to this 
very day. 
Yesterday, my good friend and south 
Florida colleague, Mr. DIAZ-BALART, 
spoke about the horrors of Castro’s 
Cuba. He so eloquently explained: ‘‘If 
anybody wants to know the devasta-
tion of socialism and the tyranny that 
often is accompanied by socialism, I in-
vite you to come and speak to some of 
my constituents, including the thou-
sands—thousands—of former political 
prisoners.’’ 
This is a joint invitation. Please, 
come to my south Florida community 
and meet Mr. DIAZ-BALART’s constitu-
ents and meet my constituents who 
will make it clear the Cuban regime 
and other similar authoritarian re-
gimes across Latin America are instru-
ments of evil and are not worthy of 
praise. 
I would like to close again by quoting 
my good friend, Mr. DIAZ-BALART: ‘‘The 
Castro regime is a threat, not only to 
the national security of the United 
States but also to all the democracies 
in this hemisphere.’’ 
He is absolutely correct, and I stand 
with him. I have always stood with him 
and alongside our constituents in south

Florida to denounce the evil Cuban re-
gime. 
But today we are here to debate a bill 
that protects our children from the 
dangers of tobacco and nicotine use. I 
hope my Republican colleagues will 
join us in voting ‘‘yes’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘yes’’ on this rule, so we 
can move on to consideration of a bill 
to reverse the youth tobacco epidemic. 
The minority is claiming that they 
will 
do 
something 
that 
has 
been 
against the Rules of the House since 
the very first Congress in 1789. Clause 7 
of rule XVI clearly states: ‘‘No motion 
or proposition on a subject different 
from that under consideration shall be 
admitted under color of amendment.’’ 
It doesn’t matter whether or not a 
Member would support my colleague’s 
resolution, which I have not had the 
opportunity to fully read since it was 
introduced just minutes ago. It is com-
pletely unrelated to the public health 
bill we are discussing right now and 
could not actually be offered. The right 
way to do this would have been to con-
sult with all of us who have spoken out 
on this issue and build support in the 
traditional way. 
I have always joined my colleague, 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART, to consult with other 
Members and to join together to de-
nounce tyranny wherever it may exist. 
Madam Speaker, I will close by say-
ing that I have worked on tobacco 
issues for years. When I was Secretary 
of Health and Human Services, we 
knew we were facing a problem with 
youth usage of tobacco products, par-
ticularly e-cigarettes. Thanks to smart 
and tough policies and comprehensive 
outreach campaigns, we succeeded in 
dramatically reducing youth cigarette 
use. 
It was an extraordinary public-health 
achievement. 
But here we are again with flavored 
e-cigarettes and vape products. To-
bacco companies will not give up, but 
we will not either. 
Nicotine exposure during youth and 
young adulthood is particularly dan-
gerous. The children who are using fla-
vored e-cigarettes and vaping products 
are people who likely wouldn’t have 
taken up smoking otherwise. This is 
the public health crisis of the 21st cen-
tury. 
Children don’t vote or contribute to 
our campaigns, but they are our future. 
In fairy tales, children are saved by 
caring adults. We must save them from 
disease and death. We are the caring 
adults of this generation. We must save 
them from an industry that would 
trade their lives for profit. 
It is important to acknowledge that 
we have made a lot of bipartisan 
progress on this public health issue. We 
have raised the age to buy tobacco 
products to 21. But the administration 
has enacted a very narrow flavor ban. 
It is too narrow. It only restricts fla-
vors in closed pod products like Juul. 
Further, disposable flavored e-ciga-
rette products like Puff Bar will still 
be available in flavors like mango, ba-
nana ice, or lychee. There is clear evi-
dence that teens are already switching 
to use these products. 
We need a comprehensive policy, and 
that is what this bill does. H.R. 2339 
prohibits the sale of all flavored to-
bacco products and bans the marketing 
of e-cigarettes to people under 21 years 
of age. This is a comprehensive solu-
tion. We need to curb this epidemic 
now. It is our responsibility to protect 
our children’s future. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and on the previous ques-
tion. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 866 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 2. That immediately upon adoption of 
this resolution, the House shall resolve into 
the Committee of the Whole House on the 
state of the Union for consideration of the 
resolution (H. Res. 868) condemning the com-
ments of Senator and Democratic Socialist 
Presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders (I– 
VT), disregarding the history of systemic 
human rights abuses, forced indoctrination, 
and authoritarian actions of the literacy and 
education policies of the Communist Castro 
dictatorship in Cuba. The first reading of the 
resolution shall be dispensed with. All points 
of order against consideration of the resolu-
tion are waived. General debate shall be con-
fined to the resolution and shall not exceed 
one hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After gen-
eral debate the resolution shall be considered 
for amendment under the five-minute rule. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
resolution are waived. When the committee 
rises and reports the resolution back to the 
House with a recommendation that the reso-
lution be adopted, the previous question 
shall be considered as ordered on the resolu-
tion and preamble and amendments thereto 
to adoption without intervening motion. If 
the Committee of the Whole rises and re-
ports that it has come to no resolution on

f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY 
OF KATHERINE GOBLE JOHNSON 
(Mr. SCOTT of Virginia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
on Monday morning, our Nation lost a 
truly brilliant mathematician and pio-
neer, Ms. Katherine Goble Johnson. 
While I knew Katherine and her fam-
ily personally for many years, like so 
many Americans, I never fully appre-
ciated her work until her untold story 
was revealed in the book and movie, 
‘‘Hidden Figures.’’ 
She had a long and illustrious career 
at NASA, but also had a tremendous 
impact on the Hampton Roads commu-
nity that she called home. She was 
president of Lambda Omega Chapter of 
the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, and 
she sang in the choir and served as a 
trustee 
at 
Carver 
Memorial 
Pres-
byterian Church in Newport News. 
She served as a role model for count-
less children; and while she did not 
reach the stars like the astronauts 
whose trajectory she calculated, in her 
career, she did. 
We remember her as a true American 
hero, and I send my deepest condo-
lences to her family and all who were 
inspired by her remarkable life and 
work. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members 
join me and Congresswoman LURIA, 
who represents the Hampton area, the 
Virginia delegation, and others in a 
moment of silence in honor of Ms. 
Katherine Goble Johnson. 
f 
HONORING CHARLES HALL, JR. 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Charles Hall, Jr., as a 
part of my Black History Month cele-
bration. 
Mr. Hall is the president of the Re-
tail, Wholesale, and Department Store 
Union, Local 108, in Maplewood, New 
Jersey. His commitment to his mem-
bers is without equal. 
For more than 21 years, Mr. Hall, Jr., 
has improved wages, health benefits, 
and working conditions for workers 
throughout the Northeast. He has in-
creased diversity in his own staff and 
companies across the area. 
Recently, he organized more than 
2,000 exploited Latino workers and got 
them higher wages. In addition, he got 
health benefits for local nursing home 
workers and their first raise in 10 
years. 
His contributions to my district are 
immeasurable. That is why I celebrated 
his work during a Black History Month 
celebration on February 21. 
Charles Hall, Jr., is a great man and 
deserves all of these accolades and 
more. 
f 
HUMANITARIAN DISASTER IN 
IDLIB 
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, 
96 airstrikes, eight cluster bomb at-
tacks, 231 artillery and missile at-
tacks—that is what the people in Idlib, 
Syria, experienced yesterday from the 
forces of the brutal dictator Assad and 
his Russian protector, Putin. These at-
tacks hit 10 schools and one hospital, 
killing 26 and injuring over 100. 
After nearly 10 years of death and de-
struction, Idlib is becoming the great-
est humanitarian disaster of this long 
conflict. 
As I have said on this floor for nearly 
3 years, the lack of a comprehensive 
approach for U.S. policy in Syria has 
allowed the atrocities led by Assad, 
Russia, and Iran to continue with im-
punity. 
The U.S. Government must use the 
tools that we have at our disposal to 
end the death and destruction in Syria, 
bring about a political solution to the 
conflict, and hold those responsible for 
these war crimes fully accountable. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
KATHERINE GOBLE JOHNSON 
(Mrs. LURIA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of a great 
American hero, Katherine Johnson. 
Katherine was a skilled mathemati-
cian, a loyal NASA employee, a moth-
er, a daughter, but, most importantly, 
a trailblazer. 
In 1953, she began working at the Na-
tional Advisory Committee for Aero-
nautics West Area Computing unit, 
where she provided equations and com-
putations that were essential to the 
success of the early space program. 
At NASA Langley, she played an im-
portant role in NASA’s Mercury pro-
gram of manned space flights from 1961 
to 1963. Without her expertise, the 
space travel of Alan Shepard and John 
Glenn would not have been possible. 
At the apex of her career, Johnson 
was part of the team that calculated 
the trajectory of the Apollo 11 mission 
of 1969, which sent the first three men 
to the Moon. And now, her work will 
ensure that the first woman and the 
next man will take steps on the Moon

This is the legacy of Katherine John-
son. I am proud to recognize her today.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF 
JUDGE CHARLES D. SUSANO JR. 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the career of Judge 
Charles D. Susano Jr. who is retiring 
after 25 years of service on the Ten-

February 27, 2020 
will finish his career as the longest 
tenured State appellate judge in the 
history of Tennessee once he retires 
this coming April. 
Judge 
Susano 
is 
a 
lifelong 
Knoxvillian and a dedicated public 
servant. After graduating magna cum 
laude from—it hurts me to say this— 
Notre Dame in 1958, Judge Susano 
served in the United States Army for 2 
years before he was honorably dis-
charged. He then earned his juris doc-
tor from the University of Tennessee 
College of Law in 1963. 
For the majority of his adult life, 
Judge Susano has dedicated himself to 
the law. He spent 30 years as a legal 
partner between two Knoxville-based 
law 
firms 
until 
Governor 
Ned 
McWherter appointed Judge Susano to 
his position with the Tennessee Court 
of Appeals—Eastern Section in March 
of 1994. 
Judge Susano was elected Statewide 
to his judgeship four times throughout 
his public service career and issued 
over 1,000 opinions during his time on 
the bench. He is also active in the 
Knoxville community through service 
on many nonprofit boards and at his 
church. The State of Tennessee is 
lucky to have had his public service 
throughout the years. 
Judge, I wish you the best in your re-
tirement, and I hope it is filled with 
quality time with your wife, children, 
and grandchildren. 
Mr. Speaker, on a personal note, I 
want to thank the judge for being such 
good friends of the Burchetts.

PROPOSED FY 2021 BUDGET 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, as a 
member of the House Appropriations 
Committee, I believe we have a duty to 
spend our resources responsibly. But 
we can’t make the kind of cuts that 
hurt American workers, American sen-
iors, and American middle-class fami-
lies. As it currently stands, the admin-
istration’s proposed budget would reck-
lessly slash funds for Social Security, 
for Medicare, and for Medicaid. 
The cuts to Medicaid alone over 10 
years are nearly $900 billion. They 
would seriously jeopardize rural hos-
pitals, combating the opioid crisis, and 
seniors’ access to long-term care. 
Mr. Speaker, did you know that six 
out of ten seniors in nursing homes de-
pend on Medicaid? 
Last year, Democrats and Repub-
licans in Congress came together to 
reach a 2-year budget deal that invests 
in the American people. We need to 
honor that deal over the coming 
months and reject this current reckless 
budget that we just saw come out of 
the White House.

87TH COMBAT SUSTAINMENT 
SUPPORT BATTALION 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize two units 
from the 87th Combat Sustainment 
Support Battalion for their participa-
tion in Operation Atlantic Resolve in 
Poland, Romania, and Lithuania; and I 
want to welcome them back home to 
the First Congressional District of 
Georgia. 
Stationed at Fort Stewart, these bat-
talions are integral to our Nation’s 
ability 
to 
be 
successful 
overseas. 
Throughout different periods of its his-
tory, 87th Combat Sustainment Sup-
port Battalions have provided mainte-
nance, convoy security, supply trans-
portation, and more for branches of the 
U.S. Army fighting to restore democ-
racy abroad. 
As a part of Operation Atlantic Re-
solve, these battalions worked hard to 
increase their readiness and build co-
operation between our own forces and 
our allies in Europe. At any one time 
there are 6,000 American soldiers par-
ticipating in Operation Atlantic Re-
solve conducting exercises across 17 
countries. 
To Lieutenant Colonel David Alva-
rez, Command Sergeant Major Ryan 
Stamos, and everyone involved with 
the 87th Combat Sustainment Support 
Battalions, I thank you for your serv-
ice, and welcome home. 
f 
HONORING JOE LAWLESS 
(Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise to honor my con-
stituent, friend, and mentor, Joe Law-
less. 
Joe loved his home city of Malden, 
Massachusetts, and his city loved him. 
He was a longtime supporter of the 
Irish American Club and of The Immi-
grant 
Learning 
Center. 
He 
served 
Malden on the Library Board of Trust-
ees, the Housing Authority, and as dep-
uty mayor. 
But Joe’s legacy of generosity is best 
described by what he did behind the 
scenes. I remember Joe, while suffering 
from 
debilitating 
back 
pain, 
pur-
chasing gallons of ice cream with all 
the fixings to serve sundaes for seniors. 
And catching a ride with Joe only to 
find the back seat of his car and the en-
tire trunk filled with food to distribute 
to neighbors in need. 
Joe was a natural teacher. While I 
was never fortunate enough to sit in 
his classrooms at Boston College or 
Suffolk University, he taught me so 
much. He was the rare friend who made 
everyone whose lives he touched feel 
seen and appreciated, and we will all 
strive to live the wisdom and lessons in 
friendship, integrity, and service he 
gave us. 
Thank you, my friend. Rest in peace 
and love. 
STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise this 
afternoon to proudly announce that 
today marks the start of the 2020 
Strawberry Festival in Plant City, 
Florida, which celebrates the straw-
berry harvest of eastern Hillsborough 
County. 
This 
community-oriented 
event began back in 1930 and has be-
come one of the top 40 fairs in North 
America. 
My district has grown to be one of 
the largest agricultural districts in the 
Nation with Plant City known as the 
winter strawberry capital of the world. 
As a near billion-dollar industry, we 
love our strawberries, we love those 
who grow and pick them, and we love 
the culture surrounding them. 
The festival has a wide range of en-
tertainment, 
including 
livestock 
shows, rides, live music, and the Flor-
ida Strawberry Festival Queens Pag-
eant that collectively bring in over 
one-half million attendees annually 
and serves to unite our community. 
The festival also has strawberry 
shortcake, and lots of it. This is the 
Strawberry Festival’s 85th year, and we 
anticipate many more to come. I can’t 
wait to be back home this weekend to 
enjoy the festival with my family and 
the families of District 15.

REMEMBERING AREE MIKKI 
MCCAMPBELL 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Aree Mikki 
McCampbell of 13th District Strong. 
She was a guiding light for her family 
and for all those who knew and loved 
her. 
Mrs. McCampbell was also a loving 
mother 
to 
Denzel 
McCampbell, 
Shawanna, and Kanita, and an incred-
ible 
grandmother 
to 
Tyrone 
and 
Serina. 
Mr. Speaker, you can tell a lot about 
a parent based on their child. I did not 
know Mrs. McCampbell personally, but 
I know the type of love she shared with 
the world because of her son, Denzel 
McCampbell. 
Mrs. 
McCampbell 
hailed 
from 
Safford, Alabama, and studied at both 
Selma University and Wayne State 
University in Detroit. She instilled a 
love of humanity in her family. And 13 
District Strong is forever grateful to 
her for the mark that she has left on 
this world. 
My heart goes out to the McCampbell 
family. I hope knowing that she is in 
Heaven watching out for all those lives 
she has touched can bring some peace 
to those who are remembering and 
celebrating her life.

February 27, 2020 
ECONOMIC OPTIMISM 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, recent 
polling shows great optimism about 
our country, as Americans believe they 
are better off today than they were be-
fore President Trump’s conservative 
economic policies were enacted. 
According to a Gallup poll released 
on February 5, almost 60 percent of 
Americans say they are better off fi-
nancially now than last year, and close 
to 75 percent say that they expect to be 
even better off financially in 1 year. 
This is the highest level on record. 
Strong, conservative principles have 
created historically low levels of unem-
ployment for Americans regardless of 
their race, age, religion, or gender. 
Our Nation was built by Americans 
working to create a better future for 
their children and their grandchildren. 
Both Democrats and Republicans must 
fight the growing calls for socialism 
and instead support the proven con-
servative policies implemented by this 
administration that allow our economy 
to grow and help build a brighter fu-
ture for generations to come.

TURNING THE TIDE IN THE YOUTH 
TOBACCO CRISIS 
(Mr. ENGEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, our Nation 
is in the middle of a youth tobacco epi-
demic driven by the increasing popu-
larity of flavored e-cigarettes. In my 
home State of New York, youth e-ciga-
rette use rose by 160 percent between 
2014 and 2018. 
I want to commend Chairman FRANK 
PALLONE
for his work on H.R. 2339 
which will help turn the tide in this 
crisis. I would also like to thank the 
chairman for including my provisions 
in section 107 which update youth to-
bacco prevention awareness campaigns 
to include programming for Americans 
between the ages of 18 and 21. 
My provisions will help ensure that 
this group of young Americans is not 
left out and receives the support and 
education they need to avoid starting 
dangerous tobacco products. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support Chair-
man PALLONE’s legislation and help 
pave the way for the first generation of 
tobacco-free Americans.

RECOGNIZING EAGLE SCOUT 
WILLIAM ARDIS 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to recognize William Ardis 
on his achievement of the rank of 
Eagle Scout. William is with Troop 4 in 
Millville in South Jersey. 
Eagle Scout is the highest rank at-
tainable in the Boy Scouts of America. 
It is a prestigious honor bestowed upon 
only the most worthy and most quali-
fied individuals. Only 4 percent of all 
Boys Scouts ever achieve this pres-
tigious recognition. Eagle Scouts are 
much more likely to dedicate their 
lives to service, becoming future lead-
ers in the military, in business, and in 
politics. 
My office was proud to be at Wil-
liam’s 
ceremony 
to 
celebrate 
this 
achievement earlier this week. I could 
not be prouder of William’s accom-
plishments, and I look forward to big 
and bold things from him in the future. 
As Americans we all look for heroes. 
We look to celebrities—God help us; we 
look to Washington—equally God help 
us—but I want to say: God bless you 
and your family, William.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
KATHERINE JOHNSON 
(Mr. PALMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory and incred-
ible 
accomplishments 
of 
Katherine 
Johnson, a brilliant mathematician 
whose trailblazing work was instru-
mental in America’s space exploration. 
Ms. Johnson passed away earlier this 
week at the age of 101 leaving behind a 
legacy not only of genius and dedica-
tion, but also of vitally important ad-
vancement in STEM fields for women 
and African Americans. 
Ms. Johnson’s affinity for numbers 
was evident from an early age. She 
graduated from high school early and 
went on to study math and French at 
West Virginia State College. Later, she 
became the first African American 
woman to attend graduate school at 
West Virginia University. 
In 1953, Katherine Johnson accepted 
her first computing job with the agen-
cy that would become NASA. Despite 
intense discrimination throughout her 
years at NASA, she remained com-
mitted to advancing America’s space 
program and broke barriers where she 
could. Eventually, she hand-calculated 
the flight path for America’s first 
crewed space mission in 1961 and also 
helped calculate the trajectory for the 
famed Moon landing. 
When astronaut John Glenn prepared 
for his orbit around the Earth in 1962, 
he asked for Johnson to verify the cal-
culations in NASA’s new computer 
tracking system. He said: ‘‘If she says 
the computer is right, I will take it.’’ 
The impact of Katherine Johnson’s 
groundbreaking work in math and 
science 
can 
hardly 
be 
overstated. 
American space exploration reached 
many of its milestones when it did due 
to her genius and commitment. Her 
perseverance also opened doors for 
women and African Americans in work 
fields previously closed to them. 
I stand with my colleagues in the 
House and countless Americans in 
gratitude to Ms. Johnson’s hard work 
and pioneering spirit that have un-
doubtedly 
made 
America 
a 
better 
place.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF BARB 
BAKER 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember and honor the life 
of my Jacksonville office director, 
Barb Baker, who suddenly passed away 
earlier this month. 
Hired in 2002 by then-Congressman 
Ray LaHood, Barb epitomized what it 
means to be a public servant working 
for the constituents of Illinois’ 18th 
Congressional District for the last 18 
years. She was an incredible asset to 
our constituents and a constant pres-
ence in the Jacksonville community. 
She helped and assisted so many people 
in Jacksonville and throughout central 
Illinois. 
Barb was also the past president of 
the Sunrise Rotary Club, receiving the 
Paul Harris Fellowship Award. She was 
past president of the Pilot Club, the 
Morgan County Republican Women’s 
Club, the Illinois Association of Court 
Clerks, and had served as treasurer for 
the City of Jacksonville Park System 
Board. 
Barb blessed the Jacksonville com-
munity and our office with a spirit of 
warmth and decency few could rival. 
She leaves behind an indelible mark on 
Jacksonville and central Illinois as a 
selfless person deeply committed to her 
family, her faith, and her community. 
Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, Barb 
was an incredible daughter, wife, moth-
er, and grandmother. 
We will miss Barb dearly, and I ask 
you to continue to keep her and her 
family in your prayers.

CALLING FOR BIPARTISAN 
CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, re-
cent news has indicated that an indi-

has not been assessed to have traveled 
in any of the countries that have been 
listed for travel advisories and has not 
been listed as having had any of the 
normal processes or patterns of getting 
this particular virus. 
With that in mind, I think it is ex-
tremely important that Congress plays 
a major role, in addition to its role of 
discerning the kind of funding. 
With that in mind, we will be orga-
nizing a coronavirus task force that is 
bipartisan and that will assess how we

CONGRATULATING PRESIDENT ON 
IMPOSING PUBLIC CHARGE RULE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand today to address and congratu-
late President Trump on imposing the 
public charge rule with regard to pub-
lic benefits. 
You know, around here, we get along 
on many different items bipartisan in 
nature, and I enjoy working with my 
Democratic colleagues. But one issue 
that I think is at the crux of the dis-
agreement and dislike of President 
Trump is something I agree with him 
very strongly on, and I think all the 
American public ought to know about 
it, and that is something referred to as 
the public charge rule. 
Ever since the 1800s in this country, 
we have tried to make it a point that 
people who come here from other coun-
tries not come here and wind up on 
public benefits or welfare or what have 
you. 
Unfortunately, we weren’t doing a 
very good job of enforcing this rule 
until President Trump stepped up and 
put a rule that went into effect last Oc-
tober, saying that if you are here as an 
immigrant, you are not eligible for 
food stamps; you are not eligible for 
low-income housing; you are not eligi-
ble for Medicaid; you are not eligible 
for other means-based benefits. 
President 
Trump, 
having 
a 
soft 
heart, continues to allow immigrants, 
immigrant children, to receive free and 
reduced lunch, Medicaid, and even are 
eligible for student loans. 
Nevertheless, I think it was a very 
good thing for President Trump to do. 
Our immigrants are the future of 
America. 
Right now, in America, our immi-
grants are far more likely than the na-
tive-born to take advantage of public 
benefits. A study shows that 63 percent 
of noncitizens versus 35 percent of the 
native-born are on some form of public 
benefits. With regard to food assist-
ance, 45 percent of the immigrants, 
compared to 21 percent of the native- 
born, are on public benefits. 
Well, anybody can go through a 
tough time. And I should point out 
that President Trump does not remove 
your ability to stay here, just to be on 
public benefits for a month. It has to 
be for a period of several months, and 
once you are on those benefits, we 
want you removed. 
The reason for that is, for the future 
of America, we want people who are 
self-reliant and paying taxes. We al-
ready take care of our native-born who, 
to a huge degree, for whatever reason, 
have to rely on our fellow citizens. 
Right now, we are in a position in 
which a much higher percentage of peo-
ple—63 percent of noncitizens versus 35 
percent of native-born—are taking ad-
vantage of some benefits. 
If you look at food stamps, between 
2004 and 2019, the total number of peo-
ple on food stamps in this country 
went up 50 percent. That is a huge in-
crease. It is particularly a huge in-
crease if you take into account the 
economy in 2019 was about as strong as 
it is going to get. 
I, 
therefore, 
applaud 
President 
Trump for stepping up to the plate and 
trying to restrict immigration to peo-
ple who can take care of themselves, 
all the while making sure that we are 
taking care of the children of people 
who are here. 
I also want to point out that people 
who are here illegally should not be el-
igible for those benefits. But, again and 
again, I hear people from my district, 
and I think from public comments 
made by people—like the Governor of 
California or the mayor of New York— 
that I don’t believe local officials are 
at all times prohibiting people who are 
here illegally from getting benefits. 
In any event, particularly as long as 
we have birthright citizenship, I think 
the policy before Trump got here is 
misguided and, ultimately, will lead to 
a decline in the quality of life in Amer-
ica. 
I am, therefore, very glad that the 
Supreme 
Court 
allowed 
President 
Trump’s rule to be upheld. But we have 
to caution America in that this is not 
a statutory thing. This is not some-
thing that has passed Congress. 
The only reason we are trying to hold 
down the number of people who are 
here who are not citizens from getting 
benefits is President Trump. It could 
easily be true that by this time next 
year, we will go back to the days in 
which a high number of noncitizens are 
taking advantage of public benefits. 
Like I said, I think for some people, 
the generosity of the public benefits 
will encourage people to adapt a life-
style in which they are eligible for 
them, which is a real crime. 
In any event, I would like to say one 
more time—I don’t always get invited 
over to the White House, in case Presi-
dent Trump is watching—thank you, 
President Trump, at a time of trillion- 
dollar deficits, for stepping up to the 
plate and trying to improve the immi-
grants that we have coming in the 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
CONGRESS NEEDS LEADERS, NOT 
GUN LOBBY SHILLS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PORTER) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, as Mem-
bers of Congress, we have promised to 
serve the American people, and this 
means keeping American families safe 
and secure. But for too long, Congress 
has put fealty to the special interest of 
the gun lobby ahead of our safety. 
I cannot afford to live in fear of spe-
cial interests. Why? Because every sin-
gle day when I send my three children 
off to school, I live in fear for their 
safety; because I have seen the pain on 
the faces of those parents whose chil-
dren never came home from school, the 
parents who hugged their children 
good-bye in the morning, never know-
ing it would be for the last time; be-
cause no parent should ever have to 
mourn a child lost to preventable gun 
violence; and because, as your Member 
of Congress, I have the power to fight 
for change. 
This is the power that Congress has, 
and this is why 1 year ago, we passed 
landmark legislation to reduce gun vi-
olence in this country. 
Under current law, only federally li-
censed vendors must conduct back-
ground checks, but this creates loop-
holes for private sellers. This means 
that there are no background checks 
on private sales, including gun shows 
and online transactions. 
The Bipartisan Background Checks 
Act closes this loophole and will ensure 
that nearly all gun sales are run 
through the National Criminal Back-
ground Check System. 
This legislation is common sense. In 
fact, two former GOP Congressmen 
wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post 
in support of the legislation. They said: 
‘‘This bill doesn’t take away anyone’s 
guns.’’ It represents ‘‘a critical step in 
the right direction at a time when 
more and more Americans are touched 
by gun violence.’’ 
This is a clear, commonsense, Amer-
ican solution that is now being held 
hostage by Senator MITCH MCCONNELL, 
the President, and the gun lobby. 
And this is a uniquely American 
issue. No other country experiences the 
same epidemic of gun violence. 
In fact, guns are the second-leading 
cause of death for American children 
and teens; nearly 1,700 are killed by 
guns every year. In my home State of 
California, an average of 246 children 
and teens die from guns every year. 
Since the beginning of 2014 in Cali-
fornia, over 14,000 people, including, 
heartbreakingly, 120 law enforcement 
officers, have been injured or killed due 
to gun violence. 
Mr. Speaker, 47 of those people hurt 
or killed were in my district in Orange 
County, the 45th. We have lost 34 mem-
bers of our community in just 4 years 
to gun violence.

February 27, 2020 
Orange County families have made 
their feelings heard, time and again, 
that they want us to strengthen gun vi-
olence prevention laws. I am standing 
here as proof that Orange County 
wants action on gun reform. Keeping 
our families safe is at the heart of our

I want to share a story of one Orange

who experienced loss from gun violence 
and, yet, found the strength to dedi-
cate their lives to making sure that 
others don’t experience similar trage-
dies. 
Mary Leigh and Charlie Blek from 
Orange County have fought tirelessly 
for commonsense gun legislation in 
California. Their son, Matthew Blek, 
was only 21 years old when he was shot 
and killed while visiting New York 
City. He was a victim of armed robbery 
by teens using a small handgun, also 
known as a junk gun. 
In memory of their son, the Bleks 
founded Orange County Citizens for the 
Prevention of Gun Violence in 1995. For 
5 long, hard-fought years, they advo-
cated for safety regulations that would 
rid California of the type of gun that 
killed their son, and they succeeded. 
California used to produce 80 percent 
of the junk guns for the Nation. Cali-
fornia no longer produces these junk 
guns and has enacted safety standards 
for handguns. 
Still today, the Bleks are vigilant in 
preventing the gun lobby from finding 
a way to sell dangerous handguns in 
California. The Bleks now lead the Or-
ange County chapter of the Brady Cam-
paign to Prevent Gun Violence. I am 
personally very grateful for their ef-
forts. No family should ever have to go 
through what the Bleks suffered, but 
too many in our own communities 
have. And because the Senate has yet 
to act, nothing has changed. 
It has been 1 year since we passed 
H.R. 8. It has been almost 2 years since 
the Parkland school shooting, and over 
7 years since the Sandy Hook shooting. 
And until this Congress, there has not 
been any change coming out of Wash-
ington. 
Time is running out. Congress has 
the power to stop more people—more 
children—from dying from gun vio-
lence, and we must act. 
Now more than ever, we need the 
American people to insist that our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
stand up to the gun lobby and stand up 
to join in the fight to reduce gun vio-
lence. We all have a duty to be leaders, 
not shills for the gun lobby, not cow-
ards afraid to lose an A-rating. Our 
children deserve our courage. 
b 1530 
Our children deserve leaders who will 
fight to ensure that families are safe at 
school, in parks, at the movies, and at 
concerts. 
As your Member of Congress, as a 
mother, and as a member of the Orange 
County community, I will never back 
down from this fight. I will not be 
bought, and I will not be silenced by 
the gun lobby or by the President. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, let me 
thank the gentlewoman for anchoring 
this extremely important intervention 
and Special Order Hour. 
I wasn’t really sure whether or not I 
would have the strength to stand be-
fore you today because we have had yet 
another mass shooting just in the last 
day. It seems like this is a daily event. 
It happened, unfortunately, in my 
own hometown, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
When these things happen, you try to 
distance yourself from them. You say 
to yourself, you know, it doesn’t have 
an impact on me personally. 
But, unfortunately, of the five vic-
tims, I knew one of them very well. I 
have known him since 1992, an immi-
grant, who was a father, a husband, a 
grandfather, a wonderful person who 
left the Soviet Union to come and seek 
a better life for him and his family, a 
life of freedom, only to be met with 
death. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been a year, 
today, I believe, that we sent H.R. 8 
over to MITCH MCCONNELL’s graveyard, 
while our constituents are planning on 
putting their loved ones in the grave. 
It is Sandy Hook. It is Columbine; 
Newtown; Oak Creek, which is adjacent 
to my district; Florida, the Pulse mass 
killing; Parkland; churches, Mother 
Emanuel Church, the Sikh Temple; 
movie houses; for God’s sake, an ele-
mentary school. There is nowhere to 
run, nowhere to hide. 
What I have come to learn too quick-
ly is that it will have an impact on you 
personally, as it happened to me last 
night. 
Yesterday, my friend went to work, 
and today his family is gathering to 
put him to rest. Of course, my heart 
aches for them because I knew them, 
but I knew all of the victims of gun 
shootings. And I say: How long is how 
long? 
It is the reality in this country. I 
know people make the argument, Mr. 
Speaker, that, oh, we need to do some-
thing about mental illness. 
There is mental illness all over the 
world, but there are not these shoot-
ings because there is not the easy ac-
cess to guns. And we ought to use the 
tools in our toolkit to be able to vet 
people before they receive these guns. 
How terrible is my restimulated 
memory of Zina Daniel, a constituent 
of mine who provided services in the 
spa industry. Her estranged ex-husband 
put out an ad saying: I need a gun, and 
I need the gun right now. 
He was sold the gun in a fast-food 
parking lot—no vetting, no background 
check, just sold a gun. All of the indi-
cators were there that he was up to no 
good: I want a gun, any kind of gun, 
any caliber, and I want it now. 
That is how Zina Daniel and her co-
workers lost their lives; Zina Daniel, 
leaving children on this Earth to be 
cared for, with no mother. 
While 
I 
don’t 
know 
the 
cir-
cumstances of the weapon last night, I 
can tell you that we see our citizens 
with military-type weapons, nothing 
that can be justified for the many 
hunters we have in Wisconsin, weapons 
that mutilate people and butcher them 
and mangle the bodies of children, dis-
figuring people so badly that they can’t 
be identified when their parents show 
up at the morgue. 
There are stories of these AR–15s bru-
talizing these bodies so terribly that it 
is just a second source of trauma for 
parents to see their deceased children 
in this condition, children as young as 
6 years old, barely at the dawn of life, 
dead from gunfire. 
Please do not let their cries go on un-
heard. We need the Senate to pass com-
prehensive gun legislation yesterday 
because one death is too many. 
I speak for the students who lead pro-
tests all over this country demanding 
more. 
I speak for the moms who diligently 
march and protest every single day de-
manding more. 
I speak for all of the citizens in our 
districts who have wept too many 
times. 
I speak for those children who don’t 
feel like they will get an opportunity 
to grow up and to have a voice, those 
who cannot vote, and they are depend-
ing on the adults, adults like MITCH 
MCCONNELL, to act. 
I pray that MITCH MCCONNELL does 
not experience the pain and agony that 
I am experiencing today, having to get 
on that airplane and go and face my 
friend since 1992 and her children in the 
wake of this. I hope that he will rest 
tonight, as I will not be able to rest to-
night. 
Perhaps this is just one person who 
died, just five people in Milwaukee who 
died, but this was a very important 
person to my friend. This was a part of 
our community. This was a part of our 
commercial industry. He was a very 
important part of the MillerCoors fam-
ily. He was our neighbor, and he was a 
human being. 
We are calling upon the humanity of 
you, Senator MCCONNELL, to explain 
yourself to this man’s wife, to his two 
daughters, to his grandchildren why we 
can’t have a sensible background check 
piece of legislation. 
Someone that I loved very much is 
on their way to the graveyard. Please 
dig up our legislation from your grave-
yard, Senator MCCONNELL. 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague, the gentlewoman from 
Wisconsin, for her powerful words in 
this time of tragedy in her district. I 
thank her for bringing the voice of 
those we lost to the United States Con-
gress. I really appreciate her passion 
and compassion. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

mainder of the hour. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the

ida as well. 
In honor of Women’s History Month, 
I would like to recognize Carmen 
Carrasquillo. 
Carmen is a graduate of New York’s 
Baruch Community College and earned 
a business management certification 
from Columbia University. She worked 
as the administrator of the Boriken

nity in East Harlem, New York. 
Since joining the council in 1992 as 
the senior center coordinator, Carmen

to initiate and sustain programs serv-
ing seniors and disabled adults. These 
have earned the Osceola Council on 
Aging Senior Center numerous awards 
for maintaining the independence and 
dignity of our constituents, including 
Outstanding Senior Center in the State 
of Florida. 
Her background as a bilingual teach-
er led to the first English classes for 
Spanish-speaking adults in Osceola 
County. This also led her to become a 
founding member of BRAVO, a non-
profit organization that provided nec-
essary information and referrals to a 
newly emigrating Hispanic population 
in Osceola County. Carmen was also 
named Woman of the Year in 1994. 
Carmen 
assisted 
the 
Council 
on 
Aging with the opening of the first His-
panic site, Centro Latino Americano 
Edad de Oro, in the Buena Ventura 
Lakes Community Center, also known 
as the Roberto Guevara Community 
Center.

the Senior Follies with the Osceola 
Center for the Arts, partnered with 
Southwest Airlines on a Home for the 
Holidays program, organized volunteer 
activities for AARP Community Care 
Days, organized Hispanic outreach for 
the South Florida Water Management 
District, started an intergenerational 
program with New Beginnings Edu-
cational Complex that partners at-risk 
high school students with seniors in

HONORING DEBORAH GUERRERA GALE 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of 
Women’s History Month, I would like 
to honor Deborah Guerrera Gale. 
Deborah Guerrera Gale moved to 
Florida in 1978 from upstate New York, 
where she worked as a banking ac-
countant after graduating from Ulster 
County College. Once in Florida, she 
decided to switch careers and became a 
draftsperson by studying engineering 
at Valencia College. 
Deborah worked for Walt Disney 
World Ride & Show Engineering as an 
electromechanical 
designer 
for 
10 
years. She later returned to college to 
earn a bachelor’s degree in human re-

University and held positions in Disney 
Human Resources, Organizational De-
velopment, and HR Information Serv-
ices. 
Deborah was raised by caring, pro-
gressive parents, Barbara and John 
Guerrera, who instilled in her a belief 
in the basic human dignity of all peo-
ple. Through them, she learned that 
she could make a positive difference in 
the world and that she could achieve 
anything with hard work. 
This belief inspired a drive for volun-
teer service in the community, such as 
organizing projects for foster teens re-
siding at The Grove, an adolescent resi-
dential center for at-risk teens, and 
Help Now, a domestic abuse shelter. 
b 1545 
She also served as president of the 
Celebration Women’s Club, supporting 
women’s charities and college scholar-
ships. While living in Celebration, she 
was a founding member and president 
of the Democrats of Celebration. 
After retirement, Deborah turned her 
attention full-time to civic activism 
and founded the Democrats of St. 
Cloud Club and was elected as chair of 
the Osceola County Democratic Party 
in 2019. 
Deborah’s belief that she can make a 
difference has fueled her passion to ad-
vance causes that can make our com-
munity and our county a better place 
for the next generation. 
Deborah lives in St. Cloud with her 
husband, Michael Womick. They have 
one daughter, Jenna Womick Stowers, 
and a grandson, Treston James. 
For that, Deborah Guerrera Gale, we 
honor you.

HONORING MARIA RAMOS 
Mr. SOTO. In honor of Women’s His-
tory Month, I would like to recognize 
Maria Ramos. 
Maria Ramos Joiner was born in Ba-
yamon, Puerto Rico. At the age of 3, 
her father decided to move the family 
to the Bronx in New York in search of 
the American Dream. 
The New York public school system 
gave her the opportunity to attend 
field trips to museums and cultural art 
centers, sparking her love for the arts 
with her first visit to the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art. 
Influenced by her mother’s old Bible, 
with its beautiful illustrations and sto-
ries, Maria’s passion for artistic ex-
pression further grew. The oldest of 
six, she collected brown paper bags as 
her canvases and confiscated every pen, 
pencil, or crayon that was unattended 
for her pretend studio. 
Mostly self-taught, Maria’s work has 
been shown in galleries and museums. 
Maria has also donated work for fund-
raisers to raise money for various 
causes. 
One of the most important works she 
has exhibited was at the Mennello Mu-
seum, honoring the Pulse nightclub 
victims in 2016. After its exhibition ini-
tially, Maria graciously donated the 
piece to the city of Orlando. 
Maria has also been recognized for 
her art depicting the culture of Puerto 
Rico, with an influence from the Euro-
pean masters she studied. 
Maria is an advocate for the home-
less and is known for her charitable 
work throughout the years, whether 
through her art donations or when 
someone is in need. 
For that, Maria Ramos, we honor 
you. 
HONORING COLONEL PAULETTE SCHANK 
Mr. SOTO. In honor of Women’s His-
tory Month, I would like to recognize 
Colonel Paulette Schank. 
Colonel Paulette Schank began her 
outstanding career as a licensed prac-
tical nurse out of high school, eventu-
ally achieving her master’s degree in 
nursing in pursuit of a career in pa-
tient care. 
After gaining clinical experience, and 
speaking to several registered nurses in 
the anesthesia field, she decided her de-
sire for further autonomy and utiliza-
tion of critical thinking skills was per-
fectly matched to a career in the anes-
thesia profession. 
Upon successful completion of a post- 
master’s certificate in nurse anes-
thesia, she worked for 6 years at 
Frankford Hospital and later at Osce-
ola Regional Medical Center in Florida. 
However, as the daughter of a retired 
naval chief petty officer, family legacy 
and patriotism drove Colonel Schank’s 
wish to assist patients in a much dif-
ferent setting. She enlisted in the Air 
Force and learned to transport patients 
in critical conditions. 
These skills served her well in sup-
port of Operation Desert Storm, where 
she evacuated troops, with a 100 per-
cent survival rate of those transported. 
During her 24 years in the service, 
Colonel Schank provided medical as-
sistance in times of war and in humani-
tarian efforts—from Iraq to Turkey, 
Mozambique to Honduras and beyond. 
As both a civilian nurse anesthetist 
and Air Force Reserve officer, she has 
dedicated her life to caring for others, 
be it in Florida or around the world. 
Her love for education and helping 
those in need is ever present, and she

HONORING YASMIN FLASTERSTEIN 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of 
Women’s History Month, I would like 
to recognize Yasmin Flasterstein. 
Yasmin Flasterstein is the cofounder 
and executive director of Peer Support 
Space, Inc., which serves as a hub for 
diverse peer communities in central 
Florida. She also works as a wellness 
recovery action plan facilitator, is a 
board member and the Community En-
gagement Committee chair for the One 
Orlando Alliance, is a founding leader 
of Orlando Trans Collective, and sits on 
the board of directors for Central Flor-
ida Cares and Peer Support Coalition of 
Florida. 
Yasmin has been in social justice 
leadership positions since she was 14; 
and in college, she brought membership 
of a mental health advocacy group, 
UCF Active Minds, from 20 to over 200 
members in one semester.

ical roles at La Amistad Behavioral 
Health Services and at the Mental

Orlando United Counseling, providing 
long-term counseling for those affected 
directly and indirectly. During this 
time, Yasmin also set up events to 
destigmatize mental health in LGBTQ+ 
communities and Latin, Black, and im-
migrant communities as well. 
She has since shifted from working in 
clinical environments to the peer pro-
fessional environment. She believes in 
the power of peers with similar lived 
experiences, particularly from within 
marginalized communities, and works 
to train and support them in using 
their own experience with mental 
health in order to guide and support 
others. 
She is passionate about breaking the 
mental health stigma that leaves peo-
ple suffering alone and uses her experi-
ence as a suicide survivor living with 
PTSD and dissociative disorder to help 
others. 
Her nonprofit, Peer Support Space, 
has helped over 2,500 individuals with 
free services during its inaugural year, 
and they have recently opened central 
Florida’s very first peer respite in my 
district. 
And 
for 
that, 
Ms. 
Yasmin 
Flasterstein, we honor you. 
HONORING CATHERINE HAYNES 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of 
Women’s History Month, I would like 
to recognize Catherine Haynes. 
Originally from Indiana, Catherine 
now lives in Orlando, Florida. She is 
known to be a dedicated volunteer, 
member, and supporter of the central 
Florida veteran and military commu-
nity. 
Fourteen years ago, she realized vet-
erans weren’t receiving information 
about events that would be helpful to 
them. In order to fulfill that need, she 
created a massive email distribution 
list that includes veterans from six 
counties who are served by the Orlando 
VA Medical Center in Lake Nona. 
As part of her patriotic duty, she reg-
ularly greets the three Honor Flight 
hubs at the Orlando International Air-
port. Once she greeted and thanked 
over 3,000 senior veterans for their 
service. 
Catherine’s patriotism is inherent. 
She can trace her family’s military 
history back to the Revolutionary War, 
where her family served and became 
America’s first veterans. Almost every 
generation in her family has served our 
country, including her son, Andrew, 
who served in the United States Navy. 
For several years, Catherine has vol-
unteered with the Wall of Faces na-
tional project, whose goal is to match 
a photograph with every name that ap-
pears on the Vietnam Memorial Wall in 
Washington, D.C. Last year, she found 
a Florida Vietnam war casualty with-
out a photograph. By using reverse 
genealogy, she found the veteran’s fam-
ily, received his photo, and found 
where he had been buried in an un-
marked grave for almost 50 years. 
Catherine has been finding photo-
graphs of war casualties across the Na-
tion for years and recently began fo-
cusing her efforts on Puerto Rico, 
where she has faced several challenges 
in locating nearly 100 pictures of the 
remaining Vietnam war casualties. 
One of her favorite quotes is: ‘‘Well- 
behaved women seldom make history.’’ 
Her motto is: ‘‘The soles of my shoes 
seldom cool off, and neither do the 
tires on my car.’’ 
Catherine is supported by her hus-
band, Joseph, in her continual efforts 
to support our central Florida veterans 
and military community. 
And for that, Ms. Catherine Haynes, 
we honor you. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

S1161 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2020 
No. 39 
Senate 
The Senate met at 9:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
God of might and mercy, thank You 
for providing our lawmakers with op-
portunities for courageous and noble 
service. Inspire them to labor for Your 
glory in all they think, say, and do. Il-
luminate their minds with the light of 
Your divine precepts. 
Lord, equip our Senators for their 
tasks that they may be physically fit, 
mentally alert, morally straight, and 
spiritually strong. Create in them the 
life of purity, honesty, and altruism 
that contributes solutions to the prob-
lems they face. 
May they work with perseverance 
and magnanimity for the new and bet-
ter day toward which Your divine in-
tentions guide them. 
We pray in Your faithful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
TILLIS). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
permission to speak in morning busi-
ness for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNIZING IOWA STAFF 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
would like to recognize what my staff 
in Iowa does because I can’t be in Iowa 
all the time. I am in Washington, DC, 
for long periods of time. 
This is my 40th year holding Q&A in 
each of Iowa’s 99 counties. My regional 
staff is also committed to holding 
meetings across Iowa. My Iowa staff 
serves as my eyes and ears when I am 
working in Washington, DC. That is 
why they host mobile office hours in 
every county and attended roughly 
1,400 meetings across the State last 
year. 
My regional directors tour hospitals, 
businesses, and childcare centers. They 
meet with disaster victims, govern-
ment officials, and senior citizens. 
They attend ribbon cuttings, commu-
nity forums, and legislative discus-
sions. 
Serving Iowans is my top priority. I 
urge Iowans to contact any of my six 
offices across the State if I can be of 
assistance on Federal matters. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
continued spread of the coronavirus— 
COVID–19—has the world on notice. 
Here in the United States, we are for-
tunate not to be facing an immediate 
crisis. 
In response to early reports of the 
outbreak, the administration began 
monitoring efforts and enacted com-
monsense travel restrictions to help 
blunt and delay the spread of the virus 
here in our country. 
Obviously, as our public health ex-
perts remind us, a nation of nearly 4 
million square miles and more than 300 
million people cannot be hermetically 
sealed off from the rest of the world. 
There seems to be little question that 
COVID–19 will eventually cause some 
degree of disruption here. 
The question before us now is how we 
can help the administration and our 
professional medical experts continue 
their efforts to take advantage of this 
head start. Our task is to make sure 
these 
dedicated 
professionals 
have 
what they need to continue preparing 
in ways that are calm, smart, and ef-
fective. 
Here in Congress, first and foremost, 
that means providing additional surge 
resources for the comprehensive Fed-
eral response. It is our job to ensure 
that funding is not a limiting factor as 
public health leaders and frontline 
medical professionals continue getting 
ready. 
That is exactly why, several days 
ago, the Trump administration sub-
mitted an initial request for supple-
mental funding to begin the conversa-
tion. It was exactly the kind of action 
that many of our Democratic col-
leagues had been demanding, but as 
soon as the administration did take ac-
tion, to the apparent puzzlement of ba-
sically everyone, including his fellow 
Democrats, 
the 
Democratic 
leader 
began launching partisan political at-
tacks at the White House instead of 
working together to get this done. 
Just days ago, the Democratic leader 
signed a letter ‘‘strongly urging’’ this 
kind of funding request, but almost the 
instant it arrived, he began blasting it 
as ‘‘too little too late,’’ and our col-
league continued to move the goalpost. 
His strong views on the necessary 
amount of funds varied daily. It has 
been a strange and clumsy effort to 
override normal, bipartisan appropria-
tions talks before they even happen 
and replace them with top-down par-
tisan posturing. 
Everyone from his fellow Democrats 
to President Trump have seemed per-
plexed by the Democratic leader’s po-
litical game playing. It is not clear to

anyone why he is prioritizing fighting 
with the White House over simply let-
ting the appropriators do their work. 
I feel confident that the coronavirus 
does not care about partisan bickering 
or political news cycles. This new dis-
ease is not going to press pause so that 
Members can engage in performative 
outrage that gets us further from re-
sults rather than closer. 
This is our first step in confronting 
the challenge. The Congress must be 
prepared to work together across the 
aisle in a collaborative way and actu-
ally get results. 
Fortunately, it appears we will have 
an opportunity to put this cynicism be-
hind us quickly and move forward in a 
unified way. 
Bipartisan discussions are already 
underway among our colleagues on the 
Appropriations Committee. I have full 
confidence 
that 
Chairman 
SHELBY, 
Senator LEAHY, and our colleagues are 
fully capable of handling this quite 
well. 
I have faith the committee will care-
fully consider the right sum to appro-
priate at this time to ensure our Na-
tion’s needs are fully funded. I hope 
they can work expeditiously so the full 
Senate would be able to take up the 
legislation within the next 2 weeks. 
And I hope, as we move forward 
through this challenge, this body can 
put reflexive partisanship aside and up-
hold the spirit of cooperation and col-
laboration that this will require. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO LAURA DOVE 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
now, on an entirely different matter, 
earlier this week I said paying tribute 
to departing Senate staff is one of my 
favorite and least favorite things to do, 
simultaneously. 
So I am especially unhappy to be 
back at it again today. 
There is almost nobody—nobody—in 
this institution with whom I have 
worked more closely, or whose counsel 
I have sought more frequently, over 
the past 61⁄2 years than Laura Dove. 
Few people actually understand how 
important the Secretaries for the Ma-
jority and to the Minority are to this 
institution. These two officers super-
vise each side’s cloakroom and floor 
staff. They are sort of like air traffic 
controllers who help Senators sequence 
the bills, amendments, and nomina-
tions that we vote on. They keep every 
office apprised of what exactly has hap-
pened, is happening, and will happen on 
the floor. 
They serve as in-house procedural ex-
perts to each side, advising the leader 
and the chairmen. And they build close 
relationships with every Member of 
their side, trying to ensure the floor 
schedule reflects everything from Sen-
ators’ policy priorities to their per-
sonal scheduling conflicts. 
And while the two Secretaries are 
doing all this work in parallel with 
each other, they are also constantly 
working together. On many daily ques-
tions of process and of timing, their 
one-on-one relationship is the diplo-
matic frontline between the two sides 
of the aisle. 
The Senate, as you know, is a con-
sent-based institution. Almost every 
practicality is made much easier with 
bipartisan agreement—from scheduling 
major votes to packaging nominees, to 
literally turning the lights on every 
morning. And it is often Laura and her 
counterpart, Gary, who hammer out 
those details. 
Consider the limitless scope of this 
job. It is no wonder Laura has made a 
certain piece of human resources phra-
seology into her personal mantra and 
her cloakroom’s motto: ‘‘Other duties 
as assigned.’’ 
The Secretary for the Majority is es-
sential to the Senate, and so Laura has 
become essential to all of us. 
There cannot be many father-daugh-
ter pairs in world history—in world 
history—who have bonded over par-
liamentary procedure, but the fact is, 
it doesn’t just seem like the Senate is 
Laura’s natural habitat; she literally 
grew up in this place. 
Laura’s father, Bob Dove, started in 
the Parliamentarian’s Office in the 
1960s. He kept rising, and in the 1980s 
and 1990s, he was the Parliamentarian. 
Bob was known for a wry saying he 
would repeat after tough days: ‘‘You 
may love the Senate, but the Senate 
may not love you back.’’ 
Unfortunately, for his family, one of 
the Senate’s love languages turns out 
to be keeping people here late at night, 
which meant that the Dove family din-
ners, orchestrated by Laura’s mom, 
Linda, sometimes happened in the cor-
ners of this very building. 
The exposure sparked Laura’s curi-
osity. Those family dinners turned into 
days off from school, spent wandering 
the halls and trying to imitate the du-
ties of the pages. Then she put on the 
page uniform herself, and that is how 
this distinguished decades-long Senate 
career began: delivering notes, filling 
water glasses, and studying for math 
tests in the attic dorms of the Library 
of Congress. 
That 
was 
the 
mid-1980s. 
Laura 
debuted in the cloakroom right around 
the time I debuted as a freshman Sen-
ator. Neither of us knew what awaited 
us. 
From the lowest rung to the top of 
the ladder, Laura threw herself into 
literally everything. At every step, no 
task was too insignificant and no chal-
lenge was too great. Laura has had a 
hand in every accomplishment of this 
institution for nearly a decade. She has 
played a significant role in literally 
every single victory of this majority. 
Her job performance alone would be 
stunningly impressive. But what is 
even more unfathomable is the level of 
kindness and good cheer she has main-
tained while doing it. She seems to 
begin every day with a smile on her 
face and a show tune on her lips. She 
treats everybody with the same respect 
and simple kindness, from the pages 
whom she invites over for home-cooked 
holiday meals to the Senators whose 
family details she has committed to 
memory. 
She is as happy tutoring junior staff 
in Senate basics as talking strategy 
with senior members. No matter how 
late the floor was open the night be-
fore, the same Laura clocked in the 
next morning, full of joy and maybe a 
new recipe to share with fellow Senate 
foodies. 
Laura reminds us that the Senate’s 
strength comes from its people. She 
has embodied this in her professional 
conduct, fighting to preserve and pro-
tect this institution as she helped us 
navigate through it, and she has em-
bodied this institution in her personal 
character as well. She treats everybody 
with such warmth and respect as 
though this Chamber were our shared 
second home—and in some cases, it lit-
erally has been. 
This staffer is so dedicated that she 
has rung in major milestone birthdays 
on these very premises, stolen sleep on 
a couch during overnight sessions—you 
get the picture. 
Few were shocked when Laura’s pre-
vious attempts to leave the Senate fiz-
zled out after a year or so. I remember 
being relieved when I got another year, 
but I suspected she would be back. 
But this time is different. In recent 
months, I know Laura has grown more 
and more excited to reallocate some 
time from her second home to her real 
home, to the family she has built with 
her husband Dan and their children, 
Abby and Jake. 
Laura loves this body, its rules, its 
quirks, and its history more than al-
most anything. I say almost anything. 
But she loves a family dinner with 
those three, a glass of Chardonnay, and 
a game night by the fireplace even 
more. And as they prepare to send 
their oldest off to college soon, that 
time is becoming extra precious. 
For us Senators it is hard to imagine 
what it is going to feel like next week 
when Laura is not here. I imagine she 
may feel the same way. But I know 
this: Those of us who remain will fre-
quently ask ourselves ‘‘What would 
Laura do?’’ And whether the issue at 
hand is institutional or strategic or 
culinary, we will know asking that 
question will point us in the right di-
rection. 
I also know that Laura will be de-
parting with some new wisdom of her 
own. She will know that, in a rare oc-
currence, her brilliant father actually 
got one thing wrong—that funny old 
saying: ‘‘You may love the Senate, but 
the Senate won’t love you back.’’ Well, 
his daughter will leave knowing that is 
only half true. 
So, Laura, this institution cannot 
thank you enough, nor can this major-
ity, nor can I. But I feel certain you 
will never quite be a stranger to the 
Senate. I don’t think you could manage 
it even if you tried. So we won’t say 
goodbye. We will just conclude with 
one more piece of Laura lingo she made 
famous: ‘‘Ciao for now.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1163 
February 27, 2020 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 3339 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
understand there is a bill at the desk 
due for a second reading. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the title of the bill for 
the second time. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3339) to restore military prior-
ities, and for other purposes. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. In order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the pro-
visions of rule XIV, I would object to 
further proceedings. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bill will be 
placed on the calendar. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to 
join with the leader and my colleagues 
in thanking and recognizing Laura 
Dove, who is leaving us and the Senate 
at the end of the week. I don’t think 
there is anybody else more identified 
with the U.S. Senate by Senators and 
their staffs than Laura. 
When the leader was arriving here as 
a freshman Senator, I was arriving as a 
young 24-year-old staffer and happened 
to, I think, overlap, as well, when 
Laura was a page here. So she has been 
here; this has been her life; and many 
of us have had the opportunity through 
the years to observe her in action and 
to realize not only how talented and 
gifted she is but what a person of in-
credible integrity and character as 
well. 
She spent more than two decades 
serving in the Senate and three weeks 
serving as my seatmate during the im-
peachment trial, which I am hoping 
wasn’t the last straw in convincing her 
to retire. 
For the last 7 years, she has been the 
Secretary of the Minority and Major-
ity, a role that involves managing the 
Republican cloakroom, helping develop 
the floor schedule, keeping Members 
informed about votes, and providing 
Members with legislative and par-
liamentary counsel. 
Laura has done all that and more 
over the past 7 years and has done it 
with distinction. All of us on this side 
of the aisle rely on her counsel, and 
there is no way we would have been 
able to accomplish all that we have ac-
complished in the past few years with-
out her wisdom and expertise. She has 
the rare ability to tell Senators no—al-
ways with a smile—and actually have 
them listen. 
I have sought Laura’s advice many 
times, especially since becoming whip 
last year, and I will greatly miss her 
counsel, although I am hopeful she will 
be leaving a forwarding address for fu-
ture questions. 
As the leader pointed out, you might 
say Laura was raised on the Senate. 
Her father Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Dove twice 
served as Senate Parliamentarian and 
had a Senate career that spanned near-
ly 40 years, so Laura grew up steeped in 
Senate procedure and tradition. 
But her own career began as a Senate 
page, and I think perhaps her proudest 
accomplishment in the Senate has been 
mentoring literally the scores of pages 
who have passed through the Repub-
lican cloakroom on her watch. I know 
she has made their experience a richer 
and more meaningful one. 
So, Laura, we thank you for your 
tireless work, the long days and the 
nights you put in. Your wisdom, pa-
tience, and unfailing good humor will 
be sorely missed by Senators and staff 
of both parties. We wish you all the 
very best in your future endeavors, and 
I hope that your next job will involve 
fewer late nights and more time for lei-
sure, including loading up the RV and 
making another trip to the Black Hills 
of South Dakota. 
5G 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, most of 
us think that today’s internet is pretty 
fast. We receive traffic updates basi-
cally in realtime, get emails within a 
second or two, and stream our favorite 
shows whenever and wherever we want. 
But as advanced as today’s internet is, 
the next generation of internet 5G will 
make 4G look like dial-up. 
For instance, 5G mobile broadband 
technology will deliver speeds up to 100 
times faster than what today’s tech-
nology can deliver. It will be vastly 
more responsive than 4G technology, 
and it will be able to connect 100 
times—100 times—the number of de-
vices that can be connected with 4G. 
While that will make it even easier 
to do the things we do today, like 
check our email or stream our favorite 
shows, the biggest benefits of 5G will 
lie in the other technologies it will en-
able—precision 
agriculture, 
medical 
and surgical innovation, safer vehicles, 
and much more. 
The technology for 5G is already 
here, but there is more work to be done 
to get to nationwide 5G deployment. A 
key part of getting to that point is de-
veloping the workforce that will be re-
quired to install and maintain the 5G 
network. 
Current internet technology relies on 
cell phone towers, but 5G technology 
will require not just traditional cell 
phone towers but small antennas called 
small cells that can often be attached 
to existing infrastructure like utility 
poles or buildings. 
Wireless providers will have to in-
stall nearly 800,000 small cells around 
the Nation to support a nationwide 5G 
network. Of course, after installation, 
every one of those small cells will have 
to be monitored and maintained. That 
will require a substantial increase in 
the telecommunications workforce. 
It is estimated that deploying the 
necessary infrastructure for 5G will 
create approximately 50,000 new con-
struction jobs each year over the build- 
out period, and that is just for con-
struction. Right now there simply 
aren’t enough workers with the nec-
essary training to meet the needs of 
nationwide 5G. 
Industry and community colleges 
have stepped forward to provide train-
ing opportunities, but more work needs 
to be done if the United States wants 
to step forward into the 5G future. 
As past chairman of the Commerce 
Committee and the current chairman 
of the Subcommittee on Communica-
tions, Technology, Innovation and the 
Internet, 5G has long been a priority of 
mine. I have spent a lot of time focused 
on advancing 5G deployment, espe-
cially to rural States like my home 
State of South Dakota. I was very 
proud to be in Sioux Falls a few 
months ago when the city unveiled one 
of the first 5G networks in the country. 
In 2018, the President signed into law 
legislation that I developed to increase 
access to critical spectrum, and I have 
also introduced legislation to facilitate 
small cell deployment, especially in 
rural areas. 
Today, I am introducing legislation 
to address the other part of the 5G 
equation—creating 
a 
large 
enough 
workforce to deploy and maintain all 
those small cells. As I said, industry 
and community colleges have both 
stepped forward to provide programs to 
train workers. Places like VIKOR Tele-
construction and Southeast Tech in 
Sioux Falls, SD, are already helping to 
train the 5G workforce of the future. 
But more work needs to be done. 
My 
Telecommunications 
Skilled 
Workforce Act would help increase the 
number of workers enrolled in 5G 
training programs and identify ways to 
grow the telecommunications work-
force to meet the demands of 5G. My 
bill would require the Department of 
Labor to bring together our Federal 
partners, as well as individuals on the 
ground, 
deploying 
next-generation 
telecommunications services. The re-
sulting working group would be re-
quired to identify any current laws or 
regulations that are making it difficult 
for educational institutions and busi-
nesses to establish programs to help 
meet 
the 
workforce 
needs 
of 
the 
telecom industry. 
It would also be required to identify 
existing Federal programs to help ad-
dress workforce shortages, as well as 
ways the Federal Government could 
encourage or incentivize growth in the 
telecommunications workforce, includ-
ing the deployment of fixed broadband 
in our rural areas. My bill would also 
direct the Department of Labor and the 
Federal Communications Commission 
to issue guidance for States to help 
them leverage existing Federal re-
sources for growing their telecommuni-
cations workforces and to help them 
improve recruitment for industry-led 
telecommunications development pro-
grams like the Wireless Infrastructure 
Association’s Telecommunications In-
dustry Registered Apprenticeship Pro-
gram. 
I appreciate my colleagues, Senators 
Tester, 
Moran, 
and 
Peters, 
for 
partnering with me on this bill. 
Getting to 5G in the near future is 
important for our whole country—both 
economically and for the advances it 
will bring in fields like medicine and

auto safety—which is why it has been a 
major priority of mine over the past 
few years. 
I am particularly motivated by the 
benefits that 5G could bring to my 
home State of South Dakota. The abil-
ity to deploy precision agriculture on a 
wide scale would have huge benefits for 
South Dakota farmers. Better access to 
telemedicine 
could 
bring 
better 
healthcare to thousands of residents in 
my home State and other rural areas. 
To get to these benefits, we have to en-
sure the telecommunications compa-
nies are able to find the workers they 
need. 
I hope we can quickly advance this 
legislation so the United States can 
continue her march into the 5G future. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH.) The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I

for the quorum call be rescinded.

f 
TRIBUTE TO LAURA DOVE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
come to the floor for two reasons. I am 
first going to recognize the good work 
that the Secretary for the Majority, 
Laura Dove, has done for the entire 
U.S. Senate, particularly for the ma-
jority but mostly for the smooth run-
ning of the Senate. 
Before I speak on another issue, I 
want to associate myself with the 
great comments that Leader MCCON-
NELL
made this morning about the 
work of the Secretary for the Majority, 
Laura Dove. Laura’s work in the U.S. 
Senate has been tremendous, with over 
20 years of service. Few know Senate 
procedures as well as Laura Dove. She 
keeps the Senate firing on all cyl-
inders, working for the American peo-
ple. 
I am a Senator who hasn’t missed a 
vote in almost 27 years. Laura Dove 
and 
the 
Republican 
cloakroom, 
partnering with her and with me in my 
commitment to not miss a vote—they 
ensure that I am here when I am need-
ed for those votes. I thank Laura for 
helping me serve the people of Iowa ef-
fectively. 
I wish Laura all the best in her next 
chapter. There is no doubt that we will 
miss her sharp intellect and warm 
smile here in the Senate Chamber. 
f 
MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
as Iowa farmers count down the days to 
get into the fields, baseball fans are 
counting down the days for that first 
pitch to cross the plate. As a farmer 
and also as a baseball fan, hope springs 
eternal. 
However, we have gotten wind that 
Major League Baseball is throwing 
local clubs a curve ball—a curve that 
would hurt baseball, hurt local econo-
mies, and the fields of dreams in my 
home State. That is three strikes right 
there. 
I have got news. Don’t count us base-
ball fans out. These local communities 
and this U.S. Senator aren’t going to 
sit on the sidelines. Now, here is the 
news: Major League Baseball said that 
it may cut ties with as many as 42 
Minor League clubs, including three 
historic affiliates in Iowa: The Bur-
lington 
Bees, 
the 
Clinton 
LumberKings, and the Quad Cities 
River Bandits. 
I have been in communication with 
the deputy commissioner of Major 
League Baseball, Dan Halem, both in 
letters and on the phone, about the im-
portance of these teams to Iowa. I am 
sure a lot of my colleagues have made 
the same contacts. 
I have also joined, with a bipartisan 
group of my colleagues, in introducing 
a resolution today supporting all Minor 
League Baseball teams across the 
country. For generations of Iowans, 
these ball clubs are a vibrant source of 
civic pride, a vibrant source of enter-
tainment, and—would you believe it— 
also a vibrant source of economic de-
velopment. 
While I have been to just a handful of 
Major League Baseball games, I have 
fond, fond memories of going to Minor 
League Baseball games in Waterloo, 
IA. We call them the Waterloo White 
Hawks, a club team for the Chicago 
White Sox. I had an opportunity, as a 
young person, to see Luis Aparicio play 
there in Waterloo before he made it big 
in the majors as a shortstop for the 
Chicago White Sox. 
You can see that I want Iowans to 
continue to have that same experience. 
For the record, I am and will always go 
to bat for Iowa. As Iowa’s senior Sen-
ator, I will do what I can to ‘‘root, 
root, root for the home team.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

HEALTHCARE 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today as the Demo-
crats continue to scare the American 
public 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
their 
healthcare. 
This week’s Democratic Presidential 
debate the other night in South Caro-
lina 
was 
a 
free-for-all. 
Their 
frontrunner, a man I believe to be a 
dangerous democratic Socialist, BER-
NIE SANDERS, is in the spotlight, and he 
seems to be in the lead. Socialist tax- 
and-spend policies remain on full dis-
play. 
The top policy priority of the Demo-
crats would destroy healthcare freedom 
in America. They are proposing a com-
plete government takeover of our Na-
tion’s healthcare system—a complete 
government takeover. They call it 
Medicare for All, but let’s take a look 
at what that actually means. It means 
that 180 million Americans who get 
their health insurance through work 
would lose that insurance. They would 
lose that health insurance. Washington 
bureaucrats would be in control of 
healthcare. 
The Sanders proposal has a price tag 
of $34 trillion—$34 trillion with a ‘‘t.’’ 
It would bankrupt the country and ev-
eryone in it. The only way to even try 
to pay for it is with massive, across- 
the-board tax hikes, and BERNIE SAND-
ERS said he is willing to do it. 
Do not be deceived when they first 
talk about targeting the rich because 
the tax increases would hit working 
families and even people making $29,000 
a year. That is according to BERNIE 
SANDERS’ own math. And taxes are 
likely to double. Medicare for All 
would deliver a crushing blow not only 
to family budgets but I believe to the 
entire economy. It would end Amer-
ica’s success story. 
Thanks to Republican tax and regu-
latory relief, we have a record-setting 
economy, record low unemployment, 
record job growth—7 million new jobs. 
Wages are rising. Middle-class wages 
and blue-collar wages are going up. It 
is a worker windfall, a blue-collar 
boom. A record 61 percent of Americans 
say they are better off financially than 
when President Trump took office. 
People are confident about the future, 
and the President’s job approval is at 
an alltime high. 
Still, the 2020 Democrats don’t seem 
to get it. You don’t hear a positive 
word about the economy. Instead, 
Democrats seem to attack one another 
and try to move further and further to 
the Left. During the debate last week, 
the crowd actually booed a defense of 
free markets. 
Some Democratic candidates are pro-
posing a scaled-back version of Medi-
care for All that they call a ‘‘public op-
tion,’’ but this proposal would create a

government health plan to compete 
with work-sponsored health insurance. 
Don’t be fooled—that public option 
would hurt patients across the country, 
especially people living in rural areas. 
It would disrupt insurance coverage, 
slash funding for doctors and hospitals, 
and would force local hospitals and 
clinics to close. Simply put, a public 
option is a pit stop on the road to 100 
percent government-run healthcare in 
America. 
Clearly, Democrats are ignoring their 
own voters. Union workers across the 
country are telling Democrats: Don’t 
touch our hard-earned healthcare bene-
fits. 
People 
don’t 
want 
radical 
healthcare schemes, which is what the 
Democrats are proposing. People care 
more about their pocketbooks. They 
want their own healthcare, but they 
want it at a lower cost. That is what I 
hear every weekend at home in Wyo-
ming. 
Americans are struggling to pay for 
insurance premiums for doctors, for 
hospitals, and for prescription drugs. 
According to a new POLITICO-Harvard 
poll, 8 in 10 Americans—89 percent of 
Democrats and 76 percent of Repub-
licans—want 
us 
to 
lower 
their 
healthcare costs. Seventy-five percent 
say we must lower the costs of pre-
scription drugs. I agree. The Kaiser 
Family Foundation reports that nearly 
one in four people is having trouble 
paying for their prescriptions. But So-
cialist policies are the wrong medicine. 
They will only worsen the problems. 
Republicans are listening to people’s 
concerns. We have commonsense solu-
tions to lower out-of-pocket costs with-
out lowering standards. I am a doctor, 
the husband of a breast cancer sur-
vivor, and the son of a 97-year-old 
mother. Let me assure you, Repub-
licans will always protect vulnerable 
Americans, especially people with pre-
existing conditions. The Republican 
healthcare agenda is about giving pa-
tients 
more 
choices 
and 
better 
healthcare. 
It 
is 
about 
improving 
healthcare access and affordability. 
Working with President Trump, we 
are already providing much needed re-
lief from costly ObamaCare taxes. 
These unfair taxes hurt working fami-
lies, they hurt small businesses, they 
hurt seniors, and we have ended them. 
Now we are working to drive down 
drug costs. As part of this effort, in De-
cember, I joined six Republican Sen-
ators to introduce the Lower Costs, 
More Cures Act. This legislation would 
limit out-of-pocket drug costs for peo-
ple with Medicare Part D plans. We 
also ended the drug price gag rule to 
help patients find more affordable 
drugs. We are working to end surprise 
medical billings. These unexpected, un-
reasonable, and unaffordable bills un-
dermine families’ finances. It is an in-
tolerable practice, and it must stop. 
Republicans are delivering better 
healthcare. 
Still, 
to 
make 
more 
progress, we need Democrats to work 
with us. It is time to come together. It 
is time to cooperate. It is time to find 
common ground. I will tell you, taking 
away health insurance from 180 million 
Americans who get it through work is 
not common ground. There is no com-
mon ground. That is the direction of 
the Democratic Party. We need to find 
common 
ground. 
Taking 
insurance 
away from 180 million Americans who 
get it from work and then giving free 
health insurance to illegal immigrants 
and raising taxes from Americans to 
pay for it is not common ground. 
Let’s work together to give patients 
the high-quality care they need from a 
doctor they choose at lower costs. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask

TRIBUTE TO PETTY OFFICER EVAN GRILLS 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, as ex-
pected, it is time for our ‘‘Alaskan of 
the Week’’ speech. One of the most ful-
filling things I get to do as Alaska’s 
U.S. Senator is to come down to the 
floor of the Senate and talk about the 
people in my State who are making a 
difference in their communities, in the 
State, and in the country. It is a great 
opportunity in which to do that. 
I always encourage people who are 
watching and listening to come to the 
great State of Alaska for a visit. You 
will love it. It will be the best trip you 
ever take. I guarantee it. 
I know the pages enjoy this speech 
each week because it is a story of what 
real people are doing and, in many 
cases, of humble heroes. Usually, these 
are happy stories that I get to talk 
about, 
but 
sometimes 
they 
aren’t 
happy. The story I am going to tell 
today is, in fact, a very, very tragic 
one, but it contains the kind of her-
oism and selflessness that can spring 
from a tragedy and literally inspire a 
State or a nation. 
If you are listening, I think you are 
going to be inspired. 
I have said on the floor before that 
we are a State—an enormous State, a 
big State in the country, by far—but 
that we are also a family and that, 
when something happens to members 
of our families, we all grieve. This is 
particularly true of the town of Ko-
diak, AK, and of the fishing commu-
nity, both of which suffered a tremen-
dous loss on New Year’s Eve in the Gulf 
of Alaska when a crabbing boat, the 
Scandies Rose, sank into the freezing 
waters, taking with it five fishermen. 
Of the five fishermen—including Seth 
Rousseau-Gano, Brock Rainey, and Ar-
thur Ganacias—Captain Gary Cobban, 
Jr., and David, his son, were both from 
Kodiak and perished with the crew. 
Blessedly and remarkably, there were 
two survivors—John Lawler, of An-
chorage, and Dean Gribble, of Wash-
ington State. I mention that almost as 
a miracle. They were saved because of 
the bravery and the heroism of our 
Coast 
Guard 
rescuers, 
who 
flew 
through gale force winds and 30-foot- 
high swells to rescue these survivors. 
Credit goes to all of the Coast Guard 
members throughout the country but 
particularly to those in Kodiak and 
specifically to those who were on the 
flight—the pilot, LT Christopher Clark, 
the copilot, LT Jonathan Ardan, and 
the mechanic, Jacob Dillon. 
As I said, they are all heroes in this 
story, but I want to specifically high-
light the role of the rescue swimmer 
that evening of New Year’s Eve—25- 
year-old PO Evan Grills. Now, Evan is 
a relative newcomer to the great State 
of Alaska, but his heroism in saving 
two lives more than qualifies him to be 
our Alaskan of the Week. 
Before I get into the story of this 
perilous mission, let me tell you a lit-
tle bit about the fishing community in 
Alaska and why our Coast Guard is so 
very valuable. 
Alaska’s seas are the most produc-
tive in the world and, by the way, the 
most 
sustainably 
managed 
in 
the 
world. More than 60 percent of all sea-
food harvested in the United States of 
America comes from Alaska’s waters— 
6–0. I like to refer to our State as the 
superpower of seafood, which we clear-
ly are, and our fishermen are probably 
the hardest working small business 
men and women around the world. 
They work hard. They take huge risks. 
And they produce a product that is sec-
ond to none anywhere on the planet. 
They face brutal conditions at sea and 
sometimes very tough conditions in 
the market, but they love their work. 
They love the vital role they play in 
supplying the best tasting, most sus-
tainable wild fish products to America 
and the globe—literally, the best. 
The industry used to be incredibly 
dangerous, and it is still the Nation’s 
second-most dangerous profession. I am 
sure a lot of the viewers have seen the 
show the ‘‘Deadliest Catch,’’ but unlike 
in previous decades, the culture has 
trended more toward safety. Most Alas-
kan fishermen you will meet, though, 
will have a harrowing story of a time 
at sea, and, of course, they will have 
harrowing stories of rescues. 
Kodiak, AK, where the Scandies Rose 
is home-ported, is at the center of our 
fishing community. Kodiak is one of 
the largest fishing ports in the entire 
United States, both in terms of value 
and in terms of quantity. For those 
who have never been there, they have 
to go to Kodiak, AK. It is a magical, 
beautiful place. It is an island—one of 
the biggest islands in America. It is 
about the size of New Jersey—with 
beautiful, wonderful people, with tough 
people. By the way, the biggest brown 
bears on the planet all reside in Ko-
diak. The heart of Kodiak beats fish, 
and when one of its own perishes at 
sea, the whole community mourns, as 
it is still doing for Gary, Jr., and David

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1166 
February 27, 2020 
Kodiak is also home to the largest 
Coast 
Guard 
base 
in 
the 
United 
States—the 17th District. By the way, 
we are making that base bigger, with 
more assets and more aircraft coming 
to Alaska, because we need it. As the 
chairman 
of 
the 
subcommittee 
in 
charge of the Coast Guard, I am going 
to continue to make that happen, for 
sure. In an average month in Alaska— 
get this—the Coast Guard saves 22 
lives, performs 53 assists, and conducts 
13 security boardings and 22 security 
patrols. This is in 1 month. Think 
about that. That is daily heroism for 
Alaska and for America. They do this 
all in the largest geographic area of 
any Coast Guard district in the coun-
try—nearly 4 million square miles—in 
some of the most challenging weather 
environments on the planet. That is 
what the men and women of the Coast 
Guard do in my great State every sin-
gle day. 
Now, being a rescue swimmer in the 
Coast Guard is an elite assignment. 
Being a rescuer in the Coast Guard sta-
tion in Alaska is, according to our 
Alaskan of the Week, PO Evan Grills, 
the ‘‘tip of the spear’’ of this elite as-
signment. So let me tell you a little bit 
about Evan. 
Raised in Stuart, FL—the home of 
our 
Presiding 
Officer, 
Florida—the 
military had always appealed to Evan. 
His grandparents and uncles were ma-
rines. As a Marine colonel myself, I say 
‘‘Semper Fi’’ to them. Some of his 
older friends and mentors went on to 
the academies, but going overseas 
didn’t really appeal to Evan. Serving in 
the United States and saving American 
citizens at home did, as did the tough 
training required to be a Coast Guard 
rescue swimmer. ‘‘It’s the most elite 
[assignment],’’ he said, ‘‘and that’s 
what appealed to me, [so I joined].’’ 
Evan had been in Alaska for less than 
a year when, on New Year’s Eve—just 2 
months ago—the call came in that a 
boat that was about 170 miles south-
west of Kodiak was in trouble. 
Having trained mostly in swimming 
pools, this rescue—the one he was 
being called upon—was going to be his 
first. Think about that. Your first res-
cue—and I am going to describe condi-
tions that would terrify anyone. Noth-
ing prepared him for what he would 
soon be undertaking. 
Mr. President, let me transport you 
now to this crabbing boat, the Scandies 
Rose, in the Gulf of Alaska on New 
Year’s Eve. The winds are 40 knots. The 
seas are 30 feet. The boast is listing to 
the starboard side. It is 10 degrees out. 
Everything is freezing. It is nighttime. 
It is very dark. 
It was clear the boat was going down, 
but the captain, heroically, with min-
utes to spare, was able to get off a 
mayday call and in doing so let the 
Coast Guard know exactly where to 
find them and, as a result of the cap-
tain’s heroic actions, save two lives. 
The two survivors, Dean Gribble, Jr., 
and John Lawler, managed to get into 
their survival suits and a life raft and 
waited to be rescued in these heavy, 
rough seas. It was a 4-hour wait. It was 
very, very cold. They were covered in 
ice. The seas were pitching their raft. 
They were hypothermic, it was pitch 
black, and they had no idea if anyone 
was coming. 
Gribble told a reporter that during 
the wait, he talked to John. 
We’re not going to die today, John. This 
isn’t our time. We’re not dying today. 
Even though, in his head, he knew 
they would die if a rescue didn’t come 
soon. Then they saw the lights from 
the 
helicopter, 
with 
Evan 
Grills 
aboard, hovering above like an angel 
coming to save them. But it wasn’t a 
given that in those conditions, they 
could even conduct a rescue; that it 
would be safe for the rescuer to jump in 
30-foot swells to save them. To even try 
in these huge waves, in 40-knot winds, 
in icy conditions, was a danger to the 
crew and the pilots. The flight from 
Kodiak in those conditions had taken 2 
hours, and the helicopter was short on 
fuel. They only had minutes left to 
make the decision whether to try to 
rescue them or turn around and go 
back to Kodiak. That, combined with 
the extreme winds and seas and freez-
ing temperatures, made any attempt at 
deploying a rescue swimmer very, very 
risky. 
The pilots conferred with our Alas-
kan of the week, Evan. They were nerv-
ous for his safety. They were hovering. 
They had to hover high because they 
didn’t want to be hit by waves. 
‘‘Are you good with the plan?’’ they 
asked. 
‘‘I guess so,’’ Evan said. 
This was the first rescue of his ca-
reer. I don’t think there was much of 
an option not to do it. A thousand dif-
ferent thoughts went through Evan’s 
head when he leapt into the frigid 
waters in a gale-force storm in pitch 
darkness, risking his life to save oth-
ers. 
When he reached the first survivor, 
he said: 
I knew exactly what to do and how to do it. 
It was almost second nature. 
His training kicked in. His great 
Coast Guard training kicked in. He ex-
plained the hoist he had come down 
with—that came down from the heli-
copter to the first survivor and how it 
worked to be hoisted up into the heli-
copter. And then to the second sur-
vivor, he said, ‘‘We’re going to go up in 
this hoist together. Relax. I’ve got you 
covered.’’ Calm. Courage. Heroic. And 
he did. He had them covered. 
These are the actions of a hero, a 
true American hero, a true Alaskan 
hero. These are actions that need to be 
celebrated and known in our country. 
How many Americans or Alaskans, 
even, read about what this young man 
did to save lives on New Year’s Eve 
when the rest of America was cele-
brating and having fun? Well, now they 
know. 
But there are five, as I mentioned, 
who tragically couldn’t be saved. We 
know their memories live on. And in 
Kodiak, the community, the family, 
and the loved ones of the Cobbans are 
beginning the long, slow process of 
healing. 
As for Evan, our Alaskan of the 
week, he thinks a lot about those who 
were lost, wishing he could have done 
more, but he is grateful he was able to 
save two lives. He is also grateful for 
his training and what the Coast Guard 
does and how what he had trained for 
as a rescue swimmer worked. So he 
knows and now has the confidence that 
he can save others when they are in 
trouble. 
‘‘That’s the core of it,’’ Evan said. 
‘‘Obviously, we don’t ever want any-
body to get in trouble on the seas’’— 
particularly the rough seas of Alaska— 
‘‘but they do. And I’m happy I have the 
skills and training to save them.’’ Spo-
ken like a true, humble hero, which 
this young man is. 
We are also glad you have the skills 
and training to save others, Evan, and 
we want to thank you. 
Petty Officer Grills. Semper Paratus. 
Thanks for all you are doing. Thanks 
for your courage, your example, your 
inspiration, and thank you for being 
our Alaskan of the week. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
TRIBUTE TO LAURA DOVE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
would like to start this morning by 
talking about a friend of ours who has 
chosen to move on and leave the Sen-
ate and spend more time with her won-
derful family. I certainly understand 
that because the job she has, which is 
Secretary for the Majority, is more 
than a full-time job; it is living, 
breathing, sleeping this place, and she 
does a great job at it. 
Her name is Laura Dove. She has 
been doing this particular job for 7 
years. Prior to that, she actually was 
here on three different occasions, as I 
understand it, working for the Senate. 
She grew up with it. Her dad was the 
Parliamentarian here for 36 years. 
Laura is a consummate professional. 
I work with her a lot on legislation. 
She helps me to get things through the 
process here, which is not always easy, 
but as significant, she works very 
closely with her counterpart on the 
Democratic side of the aisle and figures 
out how to get stuff done, how to keep 
this place operating so that the world’s 
greatest deliberative body, as they call 
the U.S. Senate, can meet its great po-
tential and expectation. 
So, to Laura Dove, we are going to 
miss you. As much as we understand 
why you need some time with your 
family right now and your great, great 
kids, we are going to miss you a lot. 
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. President, I am here on the floor 
today to talk about how this strong 
American economy has led to historic 
workforce needs and how, if we do the 
right things to respond to that prob-
lem, it can become an opportunity—an 
opportunity to bring Americans off the

sidelines, who for too long have not 
been in the workforce or have been un-
deremployed, to bring them back in to 
work. 
It gives us the potential to do two 
things. One is to strengthen the econ-
omy. It is already strong, but it would 
be even stronger if we could fill this 
gap. By the way, if we don’t fill this 
gap, if we don’t provide the workforce, 
the economy will weaken. Second, it is 
to help millions of Americans who are 
not working, on the sidelines, or who 
are underemployed to find meaningful 
employment with good pay and good 
benefits. 
Pro-growth Federal tax policies, reg-
ulatory policies, and other policies 
over the past few years have worked. 
Some of us have talked about the need 
to reform the Tax Code and make it 
work better. A trillion dollars has been 
invested in the U.S. economy since tax 
reform. As an example, we have seen 
unemployment at low levels—3.6 per-
cent unemployment today, which is 
just about a 50-year low in terms of un-
employment. 
The Congressional Budget Office has 
told us through recent data that we 
have grown at a steady 2.3 percent rate 
in the past year. That is good. This un-
employment number is important, but 
also important is that we are seeing 
wage growth. In fact, we have now had 
18 straight months of wage growth of 
over 3 percent. It is the first time we 
have had this in at least a decade. That 
is very important because you think 
about really, for the past decade, what 
we have had is flat wages or even de-
clining wages relative to inflation. 
That is certainly true in my home 
State of Ohio. It has been about a dec-
ade and a half since we have seen any 
real wage growth. Now we have this 
steady wage growth. 
In fact, among blue-collar workers— 
what the Labor Department says—non-
supervisory employees have seen the 
highest percentage increase in wage 
growth. For blue-collar workers, there 
has been a 6.6-percent wage growth 
over the past 2 years. By the way, that 
is about $1.50 an hour on average. 
It is a big deal, and it is very impor-
tant because that was one of the great 
objectives we had in tax reform and tax 
cuts, was to ensure that we get the 
economy moving and give people the 
chance to earn more, to be able to have 
a feeling that if they worked hard and 
played by the rules, they could get 
ahead. We are seeing that. That is 
great news for the American people and 
great news for the folks I represent in 
Ohio who are finally benefiting from 
higher wages. 
At the same time, I am hearing from 
small business owners all over the 
State of Ohio—in fact, businesses at 
every level—that although they are 
able to move forward and add jobs, 
they are looking for workers, and that 
workforce is their biggest single chal-
lenge. 
We have now had 22 straight months 
of more jobs being offered than there 
are 
workers 
looking 
for 
work—22 
months, almost 2 years of that. So 
there are a lot of openings out there. 
One thing that is interesting is that 
even though the economy is strong and 
we have unemployment at about 50- 
year lows, there still are people on the 
sidelines who aren’t coming in to work, 
as they would normally. Economists 
call this a low labor force participation 
rate. What that means is, even though 
we have a strong economy and lots of 
jobs out there, there are still millions 
of Americans who are on the sidelines. 
It is estimated that there are about 8 
million working-age men—this would 
be between the ages of 25 and 55—who 
are not looking for work today. 
This means the unemployment num-
ber which I mentioned earlier, at 3.6 
percent, which is a very low number— 
almost a 50-year low—is not the real 
number. The real number is actually 
higher than that if you assume a nor-
mal labor force participation rate. In 
other words, if you had some of these 
people who are out of work—I men-
tioned the 8 million men—coming into 
the workforce, the unemployment rate 
would be higher. In fact, if you go back 
to what the normal labor force partici-
pation rate would be just before the 
last great recession, the unemployment 
rate today would be about 7.6 percent, 
so about double what it actually is. 
That is an opportunity. That is an op-
portunity. 
Now, why aren’t these folks working? 
Well, there are a number of reasons for 
that. Let’s be honest. We don’t really 
know. We have done a lot of analysis of 
it in our own office trying to figure it 
out, and part of it is the opioid crisis, 
I am convinced. 
I have come to the floor 60 times in 
the last few years to talk about the 
opioid crisis. We are making progress 
on that now. That is good. But when 
surveys are done by the Department of 
Labor or by the Brookings Institute, 
they show that a substantial number, 
as many as 45 to 50 percent of people 
they survey, say they are taking pain 
medication on a daily basis who are 
out of work altogether. So those, 
roughly, 8 million men, for example, in 
one study, 47 percent say they are tak-
ing pain medication on a daily basis. 
Two-thirds have acknowledged it is 
prescription pain medication. This goes 
to the issue of opioids—opioid prescrip-
tion drugs, heroin, fentanyl, and so on. 
When people are addicted, often it is 
impossible for them to get their act to-
gether to be engaged in work on a reg-
ular basis. So the opioid crisis defi-
nitely affects this. 
Another one, of course, is a lot of 
people are in our jails and prisons. We 
have a record number of people in pris-
on. A lot of people are now getting out. 
The idea of the First Step Act and the 
Second Chance Act, which is legisla-
tion that is actually helping to get peo-
ple back to work, is important, but, 
frankly, if you have a felony record, it 
is tough to get a job. That is why we 
often see these people are on the side-
lines. 
Another issue that I think needs to 
be looked at is this skills gap. This is 
a big part of what is going on right 
now. There are jobs out there, but they 
require a certain level of skill. So it is 
great that we have low unemployment. 
It is great we have all these openings 
right now, but we just don’t have 
enough skilled workers to fill those 
jobs that keep growing. 
I visited dozens of factories and busi-
nesses over the past year, and I keep 
hearing: We have this job for a welder, 
and we can’t find any welders. There 
are plenty of people looking for work 
out there, on the sidelines looking for 
work, but there are no welders. There 
is one company in Ohio that told me 
they can hire up to 100 welders. It is a 
big manufacturing company. In Ohio 
and across the country, there are lots 
of these job openings for machinists, 
medical technicians in hospitals, and 
there are a lot of techs who are wanted 
right 
now—computer 
programmers, 
people who know how to code. Coding 
is really important right now, particu-
larly as you go into medical electronic 
records, as an example. 
If you look on ohiomeansjobs.com 
this morning—and that is a website 
that is up there showing what jobs are 
available in Ohio—there are 187,000 jobs 
this morning being offered in Ohio. 
When you look at what those jobs are, 
you will see a lot of them require these 
skills we are talking about. They don’t 
require necessarily a college degree, by 
the way. I am talking about technical 
skills. I mentioned techs and welders. I 
didn’t mention truckdrivers, but that 
is one area where we need workers in 
Ohio. We are desperate for people who 
have the skills to be able to drive a 
truck. That requires getting a commer-
cial truck driver’s license, a CDL. 
These jobs are there, but they do re-
quire some level of skills training after 
high school. 
I think that skills gap, if it can be 
closed, would make a huge difference 
right now for our economy. Obviously, 
we need these jobs, and if the work-
force isn’t there, these businesses are 
going to move. They are going to move 
from Ohio, not just to Indiana but to 
India because that is where the jobs are 
going to be if we don’t provide this 
level of skills training. 
Secondly, it is just a great oppor-
tunity for these individuals. Some are 
young people coming up, some are peo-
ple midcareer. Getting skills training 
is so critical. Post-high school certifi-
cates are what we really need. 
Deloitte and the Manufacturing In-
stitute have highlighted this with a 
survey they do regularly. They say 
there are roughly 360,000 unfilled man-
ufacturing 
jobs 
across 
the 
United 
States right now. They say it is going 
to get worse. They say the skills gap 
may lead to an additional 2.4 million 
manufacturing jobs unfilled over the 
next 10 years with a negative economic 
impact of $2.5 trillion. This is a big 
deal for our economy. 
The basic training for the kind of 
jobs I am talking about is called career

and technical education, CTE. For 
those who are a little older, you might 
think of a vocational school. CTE is so 
impressive today. It is not your old vo-
cational school, it is high-tech, using 
much better equipment. The schools 
that are taking it seriously are bring-
ing in excellent teachers from the out-
side, from industry, to understand 
what is needed in the real world. CTE 
is a great opportunity for so many 
young people. 
A few months ago, I toured the Van-
tage Career Center in Van Wert, OH. I 
go to a lot of career centers. I love to 
go. I am very inspired when I go. In 
Van Wert, they have juniors and sen-
iors from more than a dozen school dis-
tricts coming into one CTE center. 
They are studying things such as auto-
motive technology, welding, nursing 
assistant 
training, 
carpentry, 
and 
truckdriving. They are finding when 
these students get out, they can typi-
cally get a job. Some are going on to 
further skills training. Some are going 
on to community college, some are 
going on to 4-year institutions, but for 
young people in high school, look at 
CTE. It makes so much sense. 
I cofounded and co-chair what is 
called the Senate CTE Caucus. When I 
first got here in 2011, I started this 
with Senator TIM KAINE of Virginia. We 
started off having 3 of us in the caucus, 
and now there are 29 people in the cau-
cus. Why? My colleagues go home, and 
they are hearing the same thing I am 
hearing, which is that we need to close 
the skills gap. Companies are looking 
for people, and it is a great opportunity 
for people who are on the outside to get 
into the inside to get a job with good 
pay and benefits. 
Our job is to increase awareness of 
these skills programs as an education 
option. Our job is to get students who 
are more interested in skills training 
into these jobs. This month of Feb-
ruary is Career and Technical Edu-
cation Month. We are putting together 
a resolution. We have 57 Senators who 
signed on to the resolution so far, and 
if you haven’t signed on, let us know. 
It is an opportunity to just raise visi-
bility about what is working well in so 
many of our States and the amazing 
opportunities out there for our young 
people. 
We passed some good legislation to 
help. In 2018, we passed the Educating 
Tomorrow’s Workforce Act, which is 
working to improve the quality of CTE 
education programs, making sure we 
are using equipment and the standards 
of today’s industry to make these pro-
grams even more effective. 
But skills training goes well beyond 
just these great high school programs. 
Industry-recognized, certificate-grant-
ing technical workforce training pro-
grams post-high school are another key 
to close the skills gap. Think of some 
of the workforce training programs you 
have probably heard about in your 
community that are being offered by 
your community college or may be of-
fered by a local technical school. They 
give people a certificate they can then 
take to get a job that is industry rec-
ognized. For these kinds of post-high 
school training programs, I think the 
big opportunity comes in improving ac-
cess because programs are expensive 
and a lot of young people can’t afford 
them. A lot of midcareer people can’t 
afford them. 
One thing we can do immediately is 
say: Let’s expand Pell grants to include 
these kinds of programs. You can get a 
Pell grant if you want to go to a com-
munity college or go to a 4-year college 
or university. For some people, that is 
the right track, but, frankly, for a lot 
of people, they are looking to get these 
technical skills and get a certificate 
and get a job. There is no reason they 
shouldn’t get the same help that the 
government is providing someone who 
wants to go to a 4-year college or uni-
versity for these programs to provide 
the skills that are so desperately need-
ed. In fact, I would say we ought to 
focus on that more. We ought to 
change our mindset and say: Let’s not 
just focus on college, as important as it 
is—and it is the right track for some 
students—but let’s put an equal em-
phasis on skills training. 
We have legislation that is very sim-
ple. It says that for low-income fami-
lies, where the students are eligible for 
Pell for college or university, let’s 
make them eligible for one of these 
skills training programs that are less 
than 15 weeks. It has to be a high-qual-
ity program and provide this industry- 
recognized certificate. 
Our legislation is called the JOBS 
Act. It makes so much sense. It is bi-
partisan and bicameral and we should 
get it done. By the way, for those stu-
dents who go through a technical 
training program and get that certifi-
cate and end up getting a job, a lot of 
them do go to college, but guess who 
pays for it? Typically, it is the com-
pany who pays for it. So they don’t end 
up having this big debt or burden that 
so many students have. 
Student debt in Ohio is about $27,000 
per student; whereas, if you go to one 
of these programs and end up getting 
an associate’s degree or bachelor’s de-
gree or master’s degree, typically you 
aren’t paying anything because your 
employer is going to pay for you to get 
that additional training. 
My hope is that we can move this 
legislation forward quickly. It is some-
thing I hear from everyone back in 
Ohio. Over the past few weeks, we held 
roundtables on workforce at manufac-
turing businesses such as Stanley Elec-
tric in Madison County and Fecon, 
Inc., in Warren County, and we talked 
about this issue with businessowners, 
with community colleges, with workers 
who are actually on the job, and all 
these groups agree the JOBS Act is 
needed and needed badly. 
What is more, we know that a lot of 
businessowners who are getting en-
gaged in this are willing to help these 
skills training programs to be more ef-
fective and to provide the skills train-
ing that actually works for them. 
The JOBS Act has now been endorsed 
by the National Skills Coalition, the 
Association for Career and Technical 
Education, the Business Roundtable, 
and other groups. It is the No. 1 pri-
ority, we are told, of the Association of 
Community Colleges and the American 
Association of Community Colleges. 
We heard the same thing from the Ohio 
Association of Community Colleges 
when I met with them earlier this 
month. 
I must state that I am also very 
pleased that the JOBS Act is included 
in the President’s budget this year, as 
it was last year. I applaud President 
Trump and his administration for pro-
moting this and on the work they are 
doing in training, internships, appren-
ticeships, and the JOBS Act, to provide 
this funding to encourage more Ameri-
cans to get the skills training needed 
for them to have a better future. It is 
the best proposal out there, I believe, 
to help fill the skills gap right away. 
There are some alternative proposals 
out there that limit the kind of pro-
grams that would be eligible for this by 
requiring them to be a certain number 
of hours. Our community colleges in 
Ohio tell me that none of their short- 
term training programs would qualify 
for some of these alternatives that peo-
ple are talking about. For programs 
like welding, precision machining, and 
electrical trades, we need to get the 
funding into the short-term training 
programs now. 
As I said earlier, this is CTE Month, 
Career Technical Education Month, so 
it is a good time to talk about all 
forms of technical education. If we 
make expanding these technical skills 
programs a priority, if we enact the 
JOBS Act that I have been talking 
about today, we are going to address 
the No. 1 issue we hear from our em-
ployers, and we are going to help mil-
lions of Americans have a better oppor-
tunity. 
There is momentum in Ohio right 
now. Businesses are expanding and 
seeking skilled workers, but, again, the 
skills gap is still an impediment. We 
need to seize this opportunity, keep 
our economy moving in a positive di-
rection, and help Ohioans develop the 
skills to grow in the career of their 
choice and fulfill their potential in life. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, let 
me comment that the Senator from 
Ohio is right on target. I know that 
when we did the authorization bills— 
we actually have language now that we 
put in to try to encourage people while 
they are still in high school to find out 
what they want to do with their lives. 
One of the problems we have right 
now is, we have a great economy—the 
best economy we have had in my life-
time—but the bad side of that is, there 
is a lot of competition out there, and 
we want to make sure that people are 
directed into areas where they really 
can enjoy life and where the market

will work in their favor. We are very 
much concerned about that with the 
two bills we have done so far that has 
new language in there to encourage 
people to use pilot programs in high 
school to know what direction they 
want to go with their lives. 
ABORTION 
Mr. President, this week, we voted on 
two very important bills—the Pain-Ca-
pable Unborn Child Protection Act and 
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act. Unfortunately, my col-
leagues on the Democratic side voted 
to block these bills, but I would like to 
thank my colleagues, Senators GRAHAM 
and SASSE, for their leadership on 
these bills. I would like to thank Sen-
ator MCCONNELL for his efforts to bring 
these bills to the floor. 
Now this short comment period I 
have here does have a happy ending, 
and I am actually anxious to share 
some things with people. When you 
look at these two bills—first, Senator 
SASSE’s bill, the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act—a bill I co-
sponsored in the past—it would ensure 
that a baby who survives an abortion 
would receive the same treatment as 
any other child who was naturally born 
at the same age. Now that is inter-
esting. How many people out there re-
alize that if someone goes to an abor-
tion and they were not successful in 
killing the unborn baby, when they 
survive and they are out and they are 
breathing, they don’t get the same 
treatment any other baby would get? 
People are not aware of that. 
So that is what this bill is all about. 
That is just morally right, and I don’t 
see why there would be any disagree-
ment about it. The bill is not even 
about abortion. It is about infanticide. 
It was 28 years ago that I came down 
here in this very Chamber to tell the 
story of Ana Rosa Rodriguez. This is 
what I said. Keep in mind this was 28 
years ago. I said: 
Mr. Chairman, there is a big misconception 
regarding abortion and the issue of women 
and their right to protect their bodies. It is 
not that right that I object to but the right 
that is given them to kill an unborn fetus— 
an unborn child. 
I want to share with you a story that my 
colleague CHRIS SMITH told me some time 
ago on this very floor. 
Ana Rosa Rodriguez is an abortion sur-
vivor. . . . At birth she was a healthy 3 
pound baby girl, except for her injury; she 
was missing an arm. Ana survived a botched 
abortion. 
Her mother attempted to get an abortion 
in her 32nd week of pregnancy when she was 
perfectly healthy—8 weeks past what New 
York State [at that time would] legally 
[allow]. In the unsuccessful abortion at-
tempt, the baby’s right arm was ripped off. 
However they failed to kill Ana Rosa. She 
lived. Pro-life supporters agree that night-
mare situations like the Rodriguez case are 
probably not common, but abortion-related 
deaths and serious injuries occur more fre-
quently than most people are aware. 
It is amazing that we [and I am still 
quoting from 28 years ago] can pay so much 
attention to issues such as human rights 
abroad and can allow the violent destruction 
of over 26 million children here at home. We 
are fortunate that Ana was not one of those 
children. She survived. 
That was 1992. And today, we still 
don’t have explicit Federal protections 
for babies who survive the brutal abor-
tion process. As I said, this issue is not 
about abortion but about caring for a 
baby outside the womb. This baby is 
alive. It is a baby who is living in the 
real world. 
The need for these protections has 
become even clearer as we see States 
like New York and Illinois allowing 
abortion for virtually any reason up to 
the point of birth and supporting infan-
ticide by removing protections for an 
infant born alive after a failed abor-
tion. 
Just a few years ago, after that 
speech—and that would have been in 
1997—I was on the floor with my good 
friend Rick Santorum to try to pass a 
partial-birth abortion ban and end the 
practice of late-term abortions. Fortu-
nately, we won—won the battle against 
partial-birth 
abortions 
and 
finally 
ended that practice in 2003. That ban 
was upheld by the Supreme Court in 
2007. 
We have yet to pass legislation ban-
ning late-term abortion. Only seven 
countries 
allow 
abortion 
after 
20 
weeks, including the United States and 
North Korea. Now, that is horrific. The 
United States is supposed to be an ex-
ample in regard to global human 
rights, yet we are on par with North 
Korea when it comes to protecting the 
unborn. 
Senator GRAHAM’s Pain-Capable Un-
born Child Protection Act would help 
roll back the practice by prohibiting 
abortion after 20 weeks post-fertiliza-
tion. The reason he is using this 20 
weeks is there is one agreement that 
no one takes issue with, and that is, 
babies feel pain after that time. Most 
people say that babies feel pain greater 
than adults do. That is why that 20 
weeks was used in the legislation. 
This is another commonsense bill 
that should not divide us along par-
tisan lines. A baby is a baby whether in 
or outside the womb, and each baby de-
serves a chance to live as an individual 
created in the image of God. 
There is still much more we need to 
do to end the abortion-on-demand cul-
ture, but, thankfully, we have the most 
pro-life President we have had in his-
tory. This January, President Trump 
became the first sitting President to 
attend the annual March for Life. It is 
a rally in Washington. Hundreds of pro- 
life Oklahomans joined the President 
and tens of thousands of Americans in 
the march. I had a chance to meet 
many of these Oklahomans, many of 
them extremely young—as young as in 
high school. They were here marching. 
They asked me how to respond when 
the radical left attacks their views, 
and I told them to be kind but not to 
be afraid to voice their opinions. After 
all, they are right. 
Under President Trump’s leadership, 
we protected the Hyde amendment. We 
reinstated and expanded the Mexico 
City policy and stripped abortion pro-
viders like Planned Parenthood from 
using title X funding for abortions. 
And not just that, but under this Presi-
dent, we have also confirmed 193 new 
judges. That is the largest number of 
judges in this particular timeframe of 
a new President. There are 193 new 
judges, the second highest total in his-
tory at this point in a Presidency. 
These judges actually understand and 
uphold the Constitution. I haven’t 
polled them myself, but I suspect the 
vast majority or maybe all of them are 
very sensitive to the sanctity of human 
life. 
The need to stand up for our babies is 
as important today as it was when I 
made this speech in 1992 and in 1997. I 
am looking forward to building on the 
successes under this President. 
We have something happening that is 
unusual now. We have a President who 
is very pro-life, and we also have a lot 
of new judges whom we suspect will be 
conservative, constitutional judges. We 
will overcome evil with good by up-
holding and affirming the dignity and 
inherent worth of every human life, 
and we will seize the opportunity that 
we have today. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I 
want to talk today about Black His-
tory Month and, specifically, about 
Black History Month and baseball. 
This month marks the 100th anniver-
sary of the founding of the first suc-
cessful, organized league for profes-
sional African-American baseball play-
ers. 
On February 13, 1920, a group of eight 
midwestern team owners got together 
at the Paseo YMCA in Kansas City, 
MO, 
to 
form 
the 
Negro 
National 
League. Before then, these African- 
American teams had a lot of great 
players. They barnstormed around the 
country. They played sort of whomever 
they could and whenever they could. 
But in 1920, these eight owners got to-
gether and decided that everybody 
would benefit with more structure in 
the league, and they established a 
league to see that we got that struc-
ture. 
In the first 10 years of the league, the 
Kansas City Monarchs won the pennant 
four times. As the league thrived, other 
leagues were formed for African-Amer-
ican players in the South and in the 
East. Over the years, some of the 
greatest players in baseball played in 
the Negro leagues. Jackie Robinson, 
Satchel Paige, and Kansas City’s own 
Buck O’Neil played there. There were 
many others we would recognize who

then became part of the major leagues 
following Jackie Robinson. 
There are lots of players you will 
learn a lot about at the Negro Leagues 
Baseball Museum in Kansas City. The 
Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in 
Kansas City tells this story and tells it 
well. They don’t just tell the story of 
African-American organized baseball, 
but they really tell the story of a 
thriving 
community 
beyond 
that, 
which is an important part of our leg-
acy. 
Obviously, a more important part of 
our legacy is to bring everybody to-
gether, but in those years, around the 
time the Negro leagues were formed, 
African-American communities in arts 
and entertainment and in businesses 
were significant. Part of that story is 
told there as well. 
The 100th anniversary of the found-
ing of the Negro leagues is an oppor-
tunity for us to talk about that. These 
leagues had great talent. In fact, the 
Pittsburgh Grays would play here in 
Washington half of the time. Half of 
their 
games—their 
so-called 
home 
games—they played in Washington at 
Griffith Stadium, where the Wash-
ington Senators played. I don’t think 
there is any argument that when the 
Grays played here—the African-Amer-
ican team, the Negro leagues team 
played here—there was a greater crowd 
than there was when the Senators 
played, and there was better baseball. 
These were great and exciting times in 
baseball. I think that is well told at 
the museum. 
TIM KAINE, a Kansas Citian who now 
represents Virginia in Congress, and I 
are working together to commemorate 
the centennial of the Negro Leagues 
with the minting of a new coin by the 
Treasury. We are joined over in the 
House 
by 
Congressman 
EMANUEL 
CLEAVER, from Kansas City in my 
State of Missouri, and Congressman 
STEVE STIVERS from Ohio. 
The way the minting of this coin 
works, of course, is that there is no 
cost to the taxpayers. You print a coin. 
Congress decides that this is an issue 
worthy of recognizing, and you mint 
the coin. I think I said print. Mint is 
more accurate. Once all of the costs of 
minting those coins have been met— 
and there is no taxpayer cost—then the 
money goes to the recipient organiza-
tion from that point on. There would 
be a gold coin and a silver coin and a 
bronze coin at different levels available 
for people to buy. 
Now, 75 of our Senate colleagues, in-
cluding the Presiding Officer and me, 
have cosponsored this legislation. I 
think we will get it passed very soon. 
With any luck, we might even pass it 
right here in the next day or so during 
Black History Month. 
I want to recognize Bob Kendrick, 
the president of the Negro Leagues 
Baseball Museum, for his support in en-
couraging us to see if we could make 
this coin a reality and all that he and 
his board have done to preserve the his-
tory of Negro leagues baseball. 
I have been certainly glad to take my 
son Charlie to the museum. I go there 
with some frequency. A few years ago, 
I encouraged Major League Baseball to 
have an event there when they were 
having the All-Star Game in Kansas 
City. I don’t think there was a player 
who went to that event at the Negro 
Leagues Baseball Museum who wasn’t 
both impressed and touched by what 
they saw there. It is an important part 
of our history. 
Another part of our history that very 
closely relates to this is something I 
will be a part of later this afternoon. 
Congressman DAVID
TRONE
of Mary-
land, over on the House side, and I, 
along with Senator DURBIN and Con-
gressman CLAY from St. Louis and Con-
gresswoman WAGNER from St. Louis, 
are sending a letter to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame telling them that they 
need to include Curt Flood in the Base-
ball Hall of Fame. 
Curt Flood was a great player and 
should be part of the Baseball Hall of 
Fame just on his playing skills alone. 
He played with the Cardinals most of 
his entire career—7 consecutive years. 
That included two World Series pen-
nants in 1964 and 1967. He won seven 
Gold Gloves in those 7 years and was 
designated the best center fielder in 
the National League. 
I remember that team well. We were 
Cardinals fans in my house. In the late 
1950s and early 1960s, you didn’t have 
many sports on TV. We listened to vir-
tually every Cardinals game we could 
hear on the radio. My mom and dad 
were dairy farmers. I remember being 
out hauling hay at night, and whoever 
was driving the truck should have been 
almost deaf because if there was a Car-
dinals game going on, the radio would 
be as loud as it possibly could be so 
those of us out tossing the bales on the 
hay truck could hear the Cardinals 
game. 
I also remember—and I checked my-
self yesterday to be sure I was accu-
rate—but on that Curt Flood team, 
that 1964 team, it was Bill White at 
first base; Julian Javier at second base, 
Dick Groat, short stop; Ken Boyer, 
third base, and Tim McCarver catch-
ing. Most of the time, and always if 
available, Bob Gibson was pitching. In 
the outfield was Lou Brock—the great 
Lou Brock. Curt Flood was in center 
field, and Mike Shannon in right field. 
By the way, Mike Shannon still an-
nounces the Cardinals games on the 
radio and occasionally on television. 
It was a great team, and Curt Flood 
was an important part of that team. 
Frankly, he should be in the Hall of 
Fame just because of that—the two 
World Series, Most Valuable Player, 
the best center fielder in baseball, at 
least in the National League, for 7 
years straight. 
In late 1969, the Cardinals decided 
they were going to trade Curt Flood to 
the Phillies. I don’t think Curt Flood 
necessarily had anything against the 
Phillies, but he didn’t want to be trad-
ed against his will. So he wrote a letter 
to the commissioner of baseball. In 
that letter he said: ‘‘After 12 years in 
the Major Leagues, I do not feel that I 
am a piece of property to be bought 
and sold irrespective of my wishes.’’ 
That began the challenge of the reserve 
clause in baseball. Maybe it is particu-
larly significant here in Black History 
Month that an African-American play-
er was the one who challenged the re-
serve clause. 
With the reserve clause in baseball, 
you would play for your team’s owner 
as long as you wanted to play unless 
your team’s owner decided you would 
play for someone else. Then you would 
play for that person as long as they 
wanted you to play, unless you decided 
you didn’t want to play baseball any-
more. 
It was Curt Flood who challenged 
that. He lost his Supreme Court case. 
It was a 5-to-4 loss in the Supreme 
Court. But it didn’t take too many 
years before not only was the reserve 
clause reversed but Curt Flood was rec-
ognized in Federal legislation. 
There is a copy of that single-page 
letter filed as part of the 1970 case at 
the Hall of Fame at Cooperstown. If 
there is a copy of Curt Flood’s letter in 
the Hall of Fame, then, Curt Flood 
should be in the Hall of Fame. 
I hope those looking back at what is 
called the golden years of baseball look 
at players who didn’t get into the Hall 
of Fame, take our advice, look at Curt 
Flood, look at the difference he has 
made for players playing the game 
today, and put him in the Hall of 
Fame. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I come to the floor today to say 
that we have gotten some good news 
this week from our Southern border. 
We are making progress on the wall 
that President Trump has fought so 
hard for, and that progress will be fur-
ther supported by billions of dollars in 
new appropriations funding to reach 
the President’s goal of 450 miles by 
2021. Think about it—450 miles that 
have been secured. 
What we do know is that as a result 
of all of these ramped-up security ef-
forts, border apprehensions are down 78 
percent from last May’s high of over 
130,000. We have had falling—falling— 
numbers every single month for the 
last 8 months. This is a very good 
thing. It shows the word is getting out 
that we are serious about our sov-
ereignty, about securing our border, 
about ending the access that traf-
fickers—human traffickers, drug traf-
fickers—have had on that border. That 
is a good thing. 
This good news is clouded a little bit 
by the reality that all is still not well. 
Border Patrol officials estimate that 
nearly 1 million migrants—I want you 
to think about that number: nearly 1 
million migrants—crossed our border 
illegally and evaded apprehension in

fiscal 2019. That is the severity of this 
problem. Think about it—1 million 
people, additional people. Think about 
the size of a population of 1 million 
people. That is the number that moved 
into our country. We do not know who 
they are. We do not know where they 
have come from. We do not know if 
they are traffickers. We do not know if 
they wish us well or their intent for 
coming into our country. 
While things are trending in the 
right direction, I think it is fair to say 
we are not out of the woods yet on this 
issue of illegal immigration. Until we 
get this influx of illegal aliens under 
control and manage the fallout of al-
lowing so many people to come into 
this country and live illegally, this is 
what we have. 
Every town is a border town and 
every State will remain a border State 
because of the problems they have to 
face every single day. 
Let me give an example. On Decem-
ber 29, 2018, Knoxville, TN, fire chief D. 
J. Corcoran and his wife Wendy’s lives 
were changed forever, and their happy, 
healthy family was brutally trans-
formed into a grieving Angel Family. 
On that day, an illegal alien in Ten-
nessee struck and killed their 22-year- 
old son, Pierce Corcoran. It was a head- 
on car crash. Pierce died that day. A 
few months later, that illegal alien was 
deported to Mexico. 
I have to tell you, for me, as I have 
worked with the Corcorans since this 
time and shared their grief, this is an 
unsatisfying end to a tragic series of 
events that never should have hap-
pened because the man responsible for 
Pierce’s death never should have been 
in Tennessee in the first place. 
That story is heartbreaking. Unfor-
tunately, it is not unique. In 2019, an-
other Tennessean, named Debbie Bur-
gess, was killed in a hit-and-run acci-
dent caused by an illegal alien with a 
lengthy criminal record. 
Just last week in Sevier County, 
TN—and this is something that has 
shaken the entire community—two ele-
mentary school children walking to 
school were hit by an illegal alien who 
fled the scene. Tragic. 
Every Member of this body is well 
aware that our country’s permissive 
attitude toward illegal immigration 
has real-life consequences. Our con-
stant debate over policy and funding 
does not exist solely in the abstraction 
of politics. Starting right now, we 
must look internally and ask ourselves 
what 
changes 
we 
can 
make 
to 
disincentivize illegal entry into the 
United States. What can we do? 
It seems so easy to people: Come 
across the border illegally. You might 
be able to get benefits. You can have 
access to education. You can work. 
There is a way to do this and live in 
the shadows. 
How do we disincentivize this? 
While Tennessee, along with a major-
ity of States, prohibits driver’s licenses 
for illegal aliens, a growing number of 
States are moving in the opposite di-
rection and allowing dangerous, open- 
border-style policies. 
This month, I introduced the Stop 
Greenlighting Driver Licenses for Ille-
gal Immigrants Act, and its purpose is 
precisely what the title of this bill says 
it will do. You can see from the poster, 
there are some States in red. If you 
live in one of those States, your 
State—your State—has agreed to give 
driver’s licenses to illegal aliens. 
Let me tell you a little bit more 
about this. Once it is signed into law, 
the bill will halt certain Department of 
Justice grant funding to States that 
defy Federal immigration law, non-
complying States—that means those 
States that say: We are not going to 
comply with Federal law. Oh, no, not 
us. We are going to be a sanctuary for 
those who are illegally in the country 
and are choosing to break the law. 
They decided they are going to be a 
sanctuary for illegal aliens. That is 
what you call a noncomplying State. 
Those States will no longer enjoy ac-
cess to the Edward Byrne Memorial 
Justice 
Assistance 
Grant 
Program. 
This is a program that was created to 
fund local law enforcement and crimi-
nal justice initiatives. 
In 2019, States that issued driver’s li-
censes to illegal immigrants received 
over $50 million from this program, so 
their choice to defy the law will result 
in no small sacrifice. It is their choice. 
They can choose, if they want to, to 
say: We refuse to comply with Federal 
law. They can make that choice, but 
they are not going to get taxpayer 
money 
through 
law 
enforcement 
grants. This is common sense. 
I want to encourage my colleagues to 
think back to the fear and confusion 
that we all experienced in the weeks 
after 9/11. I am sure you remember that 
time. I remember that time. I remem-
ber that feeling of, what can we do? 
Not only had we known tremendous 
loss, we had discovered that we were 
not nearly as secure as we thought we 
were in this country. 
One of the loopholes we discovered 
came about because people said: How in 
the world could these terrorists, hi-
jackers, have so easily obtained a 
State-issued driver’s license that al-
lowed them to board those planes and 
carry out those deadly attacks? People 
said: How could this have happened? 
How could they have done this? 
We found a loophole. What did we do? 
We closed that loophole. We passed the 
REAL ID Act. This isn’t done as a form 
of repression; it is a practical way of 
managing a vulnerability that was 
found in State agency paperwork. The 
REAL ID Act is something we are all 
complying with now. You have to take 
a Social Security number. You have to 
take proof of residence. You have to 
take other documentation that shows 
you are who you claim to be. 
Less than 20 years later, look at 
where we are. Thirteen States and the 
District of Columbia have regressed 
into more lax policies—pre-9/11 poli-
cies. Often, they only require a pass-
port or a consular card as proof of iden-
tity. 
Here is the kicker: If you do not have 
the 
right 
documents—meaning 
you 
don’t have a passport, you don’t have a 
birth certificate, you don’t have a So-
cial Security number, you don’t have 
proof of residency, you don’t have proof 
of employment—these States are say-
ing: Never mind; doesn’t matter. We 
are going to let you sign an affidavit— 
an affidavit—to say you are not able to 
secure a Social Security number. 
What are these States doing? They 
are creating, again, a vulnerability in 
the system. There are people who will 
go sign an affidavit. Guess what. All of 
a sudden, they have a REAL ID. These 
States say: Oh, we are going to stamp 
it for State-use only. I think they say 
that with a wink-wink, nod-nod be-
cause they know they are putting a 
vulnerability in that system. They are 
letting people that—we do not know 
who they are, we do not know their in-
tent for being in this country, but they 
are going to allow this reckless policy 
to go into effect. And it is reckless. It 
goes hand in hand with other broad 
sanctuary rules that increase crime 
and that frustrate the efforts of our 
local law enforcement officials. 
Here is another bit of good news: The 
courts are coming down on the side of 
security. Yesterday, a Federal appeals 
court—the Second Circuit Court in 
New York—upheld President Trump’s 
authority to enact anti-illegal immi-
gration, anti-sanctuary policies similar 
to what would be codified in my legis-

I will tell you, I should not have to

I ask my colleagues to join me in this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1172 
February 27, 2020 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last 
night in California, an American was 
diagnosed with the first reported case 
of coronavirus unrelated to any travel 
to 
an 
infected 
area—a 
sign 
that 
coronavirus is here on our shores and 
we must act swiftly and strongly to 
contain its spread. 
Despite months of public warnings 
about the danger of this disease, the 
President was caught completely flat- 
footed by the coronavirus. And now, in-
stead of quickly marshaling the re-
sources of the Federal Government to 
respond to this health crisis, President 
Trump is intent on blaming everyone 
and everything instead of solving the 
problem. Instead of stepping up to the 
plate, he is belittling the urgency of 
this problem and telling people: Oh, it’s 
not very much. The experts say the op-
posite. 
As for blame, the President is blam-
ing the press for stoking concern about 
the virus; the President is blaming so-
cial media for magnifying those legiti-
mate concerns; and the President, typi-
cally, is blaming Democrats too. 
But who fired the global health secu-
rity team at the National Security 
Council and Department of Homeland 
Security and decided not to replace 
them? It wasn’t the press. It wasn’t the 
Democrats. It was President Trump. 
Who cut $35 million from the infec-
tious disease rapid response fund? 
President Trump. 
Who cut $85 million from the emerg-
ing infectious disease account? Presi-
dent Trump. 
Who cut $120 million from public 
health preparedness and response pro-
grams? President Trump. 
And who just proposed cutting 16 per-
cent of CDC’s budget—the agency in 
charge of fighting these kinds of vi-
ruses? Not the Democrats, not the 
press—President Trump did that. 
Of course Democrats want to work 
quickly with the President to get a 
handle on this problem. Lives are at 
stake, but the President cannot belit-
tle the danger. It is real; it is looming; 
it is serious. 
To hear the President last night, 
when most of his speech was not a 
sober speech calling America to unite 
and fight this virus—it was mainly 
name-calling, politics, blaming, and, in 
fact, belittling the problem and the 
danger. 
The President must stop trying to 
minimize the nature of the coronavirus 
threat. His attempts at spinning the 
facts are just not credible, and they are 
harmful to the Federal response. 
In order to prevent overreaction by 
the public, it is essential that the Fed-
eral officials—especially the President 
and Vice President—level with the 
American people. Telling the American 
people the truth and then coming up 
with solutions to solve it is the way to 
calm people down—not simply saying 
‘‘Oh, don’t worry about it’’ and then 
spending time blaming others. That is 
not going to calm people down; that is 
going to make them more worried. 
So let’s let the science and the facts 
guide us. The American people do not 
need or want uninformed opinions or 
spin from its leaders. They want the 
truth. 
Now, the first step the Congress must 
take is to ensure that the government 
has the resources to combat this dead-
ly virus and keep Americans safe. I 
have made a request for $8.5 billion for 
this purpose—far more than the admin-
istration’s request of $2.5 billion, only 
half of which is new funding. The rest 
of the President’s proposed funding is 
stolen from other accounts. 
Any emergency funding supplemental 
the Congress approves must be entirely 
new funding, not stolen from other ac-
counts, and include, at minimum, 
strong provisions that ensure, one, that 
the President cannot transfer these 
new funds to anything other than 
coronavirus and American and global 
preparedness to combat epidemics and 
infectious diseases; two, vaccines that 
are affordable and available to all who 
need them, not just to those who have 
a good deal of money; three, interest- 
free loans be made available for small 
businesses impacted by the outbreak; 
and four, State and local governments 
be reimbursed for costs incurred while 
assisting the Federal response to the 
corona outbreak. 
Democrats in both Chambers will 
work closely with Republicans to pass 
a supplemental appropriations package 
with these criteria in mind. But in the 
meantime, President Trump must get 
his act together: Stop blaming, stop be-
littling, roll up your sleeves, unite 
America, and start proposing real solu-
tions. 
After months of dithering, after tow-
ering and dangerous incompetence, it 
is time for President Trump to roll up 
his sleeves and do the right thing. 
INDIA 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
the President yesterday returned to 
Washington from India. The United 
States and India are natural allies. If 
the United States and India are close 
friends and partners, the world will be 
a safer, more prosperous place. India 
has an amazing culture and great peo-
ple. So unifying America and India is a 
very good thing. 
But did the President do anything on 
his trip that substantively advanced 
that objective? No, he did not. Sadly, 
the President’s trip to India was typ-
ical of foreign policy in the Trump 
era—a big spectacle with handshakes 
and photo-ops but without meaningful 
progress or accomplishment for the 
United States. 
There were real things for the Presi-
dent to accomplish in India. We are 
now India’s largest trading partner— 
one of the largest markets for our agri-
cultural 
products, 
medical 
devices, 
even motorbikes. Did the President 
make any progress on a trade deal to 
reduce the significant market access 
barriers 
that 
American 
companies 
face? No. 
India is in the midst of fierce pro-
tests over a law that restricts religious 
freedom. Did the President stand up for 
religious freedom and democratic val-
ues? No. He didn’t even bring up the 
issue with the Prime Minister. 
There are 4 million Indian Ameri-
cans. I am proud to say many are in 
the New York area. They have done 
and continued to do so much for this 
great country. Their history, music, 
culture, literature are woven into the 
very fabric of American life. Indian- 
American families form the backbone 
of so many strong communities in New 
York City, in Long Island and the sub-
urbs, and all over the country. They 
deserve more than Presidential photo- 
ops in their native land. They deserve a 
President who takes the friendship be-
tween the United States and India seri-
ously and works to build a strategic al-
liance. 
But this President cannot seem to 
manage anything beyond reality-show 
diplomacy, and that is why President 
Trump will likely end his first term 
bereft of any significant foreign policy 
achievement. 
TRIBUTE TO LAURA DOVE 
Mr. President, finally, on a different 
note and a very happy note, I want to 
conclude my remarks by noting the de-
parture of a staffer who, although she 
works for Leader MCCONNELL, is truly 
a resource for and a credit to the Sen-
ate as a whole—Laura Dove. 
It is a happy note for her. She is 
moving on to even bigger and better 
things. But it is a sad note for all of us, 
Democrats and Republicans, in the 
Senate because she has done such a 
good job. 
Laura is the Secretary for the Major-
ity. As with many job titles in Wash-
ington, Laura’s title does not come 
close to capturing what she actually 
does, nor does it remotely reflect her 
importance to this Chamber. 
The two caucus Secretaries—Gary 
Myrick for the Senate minority and 
Laura Dove for the majority—literally 
make the Senate function. Their nego-
tiations determine when we come in 
and out of session, which amendments 
will be considered, and their par-
liamentary expertise guides Senators 
of both parties. Laura’s attention to 
detail is such that even the dress code 
of the Senate does not escape her. 
Laura has certainly been around this 
Chamber for as long as many of the 
Senators she advises. The Senate is in 
her blood. Her father, Bob Dove, was 
the Senate Parliamentarian. Dinner 
table conversations in the Dove house-
hold must have included the arcana of 
Senate procedure, particularly because 
some of those family dinners occurred 
here in the Senate itself, as Mr. Dove 
worked the sometimes late hours of the 
Senate. 
Both of Mr. Dove’s daughters served 
as pages, and now both of Laura’s chil-
dren have served as pages as well—a 
family tradition unique among family 
traditions. Few have done as much to 
support the page program as Laura. 
She not only keeps a watchful and sup-
portive eye over their time on the

floor, but she has invited them into her 
home, welcoming any page wishing to 
celebrate a Jewish holiday with her 
family. I want to thank her especially 
for how much she has done for Senate 
pages, and from the vantage point of 
the lens of the C–SPAN camera, the 
Senate floor looks like a forum for dis-
agreement and sometimes for vocif-
erous debate. Few beyond this Chamber 
appreciate how important it is for our 
two parties to cooperate every day 
amidst those disagreements to make 
the work of the Senate come to life. 
Though our parties have vastly dif-
ferent opinions on everything, ranging 
from policy to procedure, Laura has al-
ways represented the position of her 
caucus honestly and treated our staff 
with civility and respect. 
She even takes a bit of that work 
home with her. Her husband, Dan Sol-
omon, worked for someone—Senator 
Wofford—who was a good, strong, lib-
eral Democrat, if there ever was one. 
The Republican leader this morning 
gave a very personal and emotional 
tribute to Laura’s service. You could 
see how much she means to him and 
the entire Republican caucus. I echo 
those sentiments, and I would extend 
them to the Senate as a whole. Few 
care more about this institution, its 
traditions, its history, and its future 
than Laura Dove, and few have worked 
harder to support the Senate in their 
careers. 
Robert Duncan, Laura’s assistant, 
will be taking her place today. He has 
big shoes to fill but is a really talented 
guy who knows how this place works. 
All I can tell you, Robert, is if you lis-
ten to Gary Myrick, you can’t go 
wrong. 
Laura, we wish you nothing but the 
best for the next chapter of your life, 
and we thank you profoundly for your 
service to the Senate. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3173 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, in a message 
to Congress on July 4, 1861, Abraham 
Lincoln wrote that the leading object 
of government was to ‘‘elevate the con-
dition of men, to lift artificial weights 
from all shoulders; to clear the paths of 
laudable pursuit for all; to afford all an 
unfettered start and a fair chance in 
the race of life.’’ 
It is no coincidence that he gave this 
message on the anniversary of our Na-
tion’s birth. Lincoln was echoing the 
profound legacy of our founding—a leg-
acy that shaped our Nation and there-
after rippled across not only the West-
ern Hemisphere but the entire world. 
When the Founders broke off from 
the yoke of British tyranny, they de-
clared all men to be endowed with cer-
tain inalienable rights—rights that 
come not from the State, a church, any 
man or woman, or even from a govern-
ment, but, rather, from God himself. 
The first of these inalienable rights 
was life. Never was any nation in the 
history of human beings born of a high-
er principle or a deeper connection to 
human happiness and flourishing. Here, 
the people would rule. Here, govern-
ment would serve the people and not 
the other way around. Here, for the 
first time ever, each person, no matter 
his or her station in life, was endowed 
with these rights and entitled to their 
equal protection. 
Today, 159 years since Lincoln’s mes-
sage to Congress and 244 years since 
the Founders’ message to the world, 
here we stand sworn, still, to fulfill 
their promise. 
As far as we have come during that 
time period, we still have so far to go. 
Today, our government—founded to 
protect Americans’ rights to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness— 
threatens unborn Americans on all 
three counts. The Supreme Court im-
poses and Congress subsidizes the most

radical abortion policy in the Western 
world. 
Since 1973, more than 60 million little 
lives, innocent lives, have been lost. 
The children lost to abortion cannot be 
seen, they cannot be heard, but the loss 
of every single one of them is felt. 
Mothers have been robbed of their chil-
dren. There are gaping holes left 
throughout our Nation, in our families 
and in our communities—gaping holes 
that only those unique, unrepeatable 
souls could have and would have other-
wise filled. 
For more than four decades, we have 
failed American women and their un-
born children. Today, we have a chance 
to do better, to aspire for more, not to 
settle for mediocrity or tyranny but to 
celebrate and embrace life and liberty. 
We have a chance to stand up for the 
very weakest and most vulnerable 
among us, the ones still being knit to-
gether in their mothers’ wombs, the 
ones we know respond to human touch 
by the age of 8 weeks, who feel pain by 
the age of 20 weeks, and who recognize 
the sound of their mother’s voice be-
fore they are even born. 
Science and medicine are only con-
firming what we know deep down—that 
unborn human beings are, in fact, just 
like us. Every day, more scientific evi-
dence confirms our moral intuition 
that a person is a person no matter 
how small that person happens to be. 
The so-called Pain-Capable Unborn 
Child Protection Act that was before 
us earlier this week would have banned 
abortions for babies more than 20 
weeks of age, upholding in law what 
science already confirms; that is, that 
these babies feel every bit of their life 
as it is being ended. This should not 
have been a controversial bill. 
Still less controversial should have 
been the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act. The Born-Alive 
Abortion 
Survivors 
Protection 
Act 
takes no position on abortion, and it 
takes no position even on the rights of 
the unborn. It simply says that in this 
country, the United States of America, 
when a child is born, even if by acci-
dent, even in the most dangerous place 
in the world for an infant—that is, a 
Planned Parenthood clinic—he or she 
becomes a citizen of the United States 
under our Constitution, entitled to the 
full and equal protection of our laws. It 
says that when a child intended to be 
aborted is, in fact, instead born alive, 
he or she cannot simply be ‘‘disposed 
of’’ in the back room of a clinic or a 
hospital, as if it were nothing more 
than medical waste. This bill merely 
outlaws the murder of the innocent in 
the first moments of life; that is, the 
first moments of life outside the womb. 
It is a tragedy, a blight, and a poor 
commentary of frightening reflection 
not only upon this country but on this 
very legislative body that these meas-
ures failed this week. A minority of 
this body chose to reject both the sci-
entific facts of human biology and the 
essential moral principle of human dig-
nity. 
When someone talks about not ac-
cepting science, I hope they will re-
member what happened this week. I 
hope they will remember that against 
all medical and scientific evidence, to 
say nothing of what people know mor-
ally, intuitively, and within their own 
hearts, this body failed to protect the 
most vulnerable among us. 
Unfortunately, this is not the first 
time in our Nation’s history that we 
have sometimes looked at the people 
according to a really evil logic of util-
ity and power, and it is not the first 
time that we have tried to dehumanize 
human beings. It is not the first time 
we have tried to pick and choose who is 
wanted and who is valuable in society, 
penuriously doling out rights to exist 
and to be free on the basis of that arbi-
trary and unjustifiable determination. 
Nonetheless, thankfully, if there is 
one thing that we know about our 
country, it is that the American people 
have a way of bending the arc of his-
tory toward life or, as Winston Church-
ill is credited for saying, the American 
people will always do the right thing 
after they have exhausted every other 
alternative. 
We have a long, proud history as 
Americans of standing up for the weak, 
for the innocent, and especially for the 
vulnerable. We have made mistakes— 
grave, grave mistakes—but the right 
thing to do is always the right thing to 
do, and we come around in the end. It 
is one of the things that differentiates 
us from other societies. We aspire to-
ward that which is good. 
Today there is reason to hope. Abor-
tions in my home State of Utah have 
been steadily declining over the past 
four decades, with fewer than 3,000 hap-
pening in 2017. Six States are now down 
to just one abortion clinic: Kentucky, 
West Virginia, North Dakota, South 
Dakota, Mississippi, and Missouri. This 
past year, Alabama passed a law ban-
ning elective abortions in most cir-
cumstances, and just last month hun-
dreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
Americans 
marched joyfully once again through 
Washington, as they have year after 
year after year, for those who cannot, 
for those who are rendered absent by 
this barbaric practice. 
The tide is turning, and today we 
have another chance to right these 
same wrongs. Through my bill, the 
Abortion Is Not Healthcare Act, we 
have the chance to stop the tax deduct-
ibility of abortions which are currently 
categorized as medical care by the IRS. 
The purpose of healthcare is to heal, 
is to cure. It is not to kill. Let us be se-
rious. Whatever else abortion may be, 
of course, elective abortion is not 
healthcare. That is why physicians lit-
erally take an oath to do no harm. 
The government should not offer tax 
benefits for a procedure that kills hun-
dreds of thousands of unborn children 
each year, nor should taxpayers have 
to subsidize it. This bill would end this 
preferential tax treatment and clarify 
that this gruesome practice is not 
healthcare. 
We also have the chance to perma-
nently stop the use of our foreign aid 
money from funding or promoting 
abortions overseas. The Protecting Life 
in Foreign Assistance Act will save 
countless lives across the globe and af-
firms the truth that the lives of all un-
born children, regardless of where they 
might happen to be from, have dignity 
and worth. Today we can stand to 
allow all human beings—no matter 
what their age, their appearance, or 
their abilities—a fair chance in the 
race of life. 
We have only to remain loyal to that 
bedrock principle that we claim to de-
fend in the Declaration of Independ-
ence: 
the 
inalienable, 
fundamental 
right to life, the equal dignity, the im-
measurable worth of all human life. 
I ask unanimous consent that the Fi-
nance Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 3173 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. 
I further ask that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the ma-
jority party’s anti-women healthcare 
agenda has certainly been on display in 
the last few days here in the U.S. Sen-
ate: two votes on Tuesday, more votes 
and debate today. Every time it is the 
same basic proposition on offer: legis-
lation that squeezes Republican politi-
cians in between women and their doc-
tors. 
I have said the old GOP slogan used 
to be ‘‘a chicken in every pot.’’ These 
days it is ‘‘a Republican in every exam 
room.’’ 
Not only does this legislation dis-
count 
the 
fact 
that 
reproductive 
healthcare, 
including 
abortion, 
is 
healthcare; it would make women’s 
healthcare services more expensive. 
This would head this country back to 
the days when the healthcare system 
was just for the healthy and the 
wealthy. 
My view is decisions about the 
healthcare of women, especially repro-
ductive 
healthcare—including 
abor-
tion—are enormously personal. They 
ought to be decisions made between 
women and their physicians. Politi-
cians ought to stay away. They ought 
to stay out of it all. That is what the 
Roe v. Wade case is all about, and it is 
the law of the land. 
So because I believe in keeping poli-
ticians out of the medical exam room, 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
the opportunity to address these im-
portant issues today. I thank my friend 
and colleague from Oregon for out-
lining his reasons for objecting to this

February 27, 2020 
legislation. I feel the need to respond 
to a few things that he said because 
they call for an immediate response. 
First, he noted that there were two 
votes cast earlier this week that he de-
scribed as part of an ongoing pattern, 
an ongoing campaign among Senate 
Republicans that, according to my col-
league, are anti-woman. This is offen-
sive on a variety levels—first when you 
consider that the abortion is no re-
specter of persons. It is not just male 
babies aborted; it is also female babies. 
There are parts of the world where 
abortion of female babies occurs in 
much higher numbers—in many cases 
because they are female babies. 
Abortion is itself—elective abortion 
is an act of violence against a human 
form, against a human life, albeit a life 
in utero. 
I remember a few months ago we 
were holding a hearing, of all things, 
addressing 
issues 
relating 
to 
wild 
horses and burros in the Western 
United States. Certain wild horse popu-
lations have grown out of control. 
They have devastated rangelands. They 
have depleted resources available to 
them, and many of them are starving, 
malnourished, and suffering. 
There have been programs that have 
sought not only to help them in one 
way or another but also to sterilize 
them. I never thought I would be part 
of a significant hearing addressing the 
nonsexy topic of equine contraception, 
but in this instance we had one. One of 
our witnesses, who was from an organi-
zation devoted to preventing cruelty to 
animals, explained that one of the 
most effective techniques of horse 
birth control involves the sterilization 
procedure. I asked why that was not 
the preferred method. She said because, 
in many instances, it can result in the 
loss of the unborn horse. I asked her 
why that mattered. She said: Well, be-
cause it is a life, notwithstanding the 
fact that it hasn’t been born. It is cruel 
to the unborn baby horse. It is cruel to 
the foal. If it is cruel to the foal, why 
isn’t it cruel to the baby, whether it is 
a male baby or a female baby? This is 
not anti-woman. 
There was also the suggestion that 
the campaign somehow involves a Re-
publican in every exam room, and that, 
according to those who advocate pro- 
life 
positions, 
it 
would 
relegate 
healthcare to the healthy and wealthy. 
Well, this gets back to the very point I 
was making. An exam room—actual 
healthcare—involves 
protecting 
and 
preserving human life. Elective abor-
tion, by contrast, has one object; that 
is, the termination of a human life—an 
unborn, in utero human life but a 
human life just the same. 
You can say whatever you want 
about it but to call it healthcare, to 
me, is counterintuitive—not just to me 
but to many, many Americans who find 
the practice abhorrent and are shocked 
by the thought that the U.S. Govern-
ment would be subsidizing it, whether 
through its tax policy or through more 
direct forms or, as we see today, both. 
As to the suggestion that politicians 
ought to stay out of this issue, well, let 
me ask you this: What about the idea 
that politicians and, therefore, law-
makers ought to stay out of other 
issues involving violence to a human 
being? There was a day and age in this 
country where people would say that 
lawmakers ought to stay out of other 
issues involving violence, of domestic 
violence: That is a family matter, after 
all. Politicians ought to stay out. The 
law should have nothing to do with 
that. Well, it involves violence to an-
other human being. 
To say simply that politicians and, 
therefore, lawmakers and, therefore, 
the law ought to stay out of a topic 
means to suggest that it is somehow 
beyond the reach of the law. If we have 
reached, if we ever do reach the point 
where we can’t say no human being can 
kill another human being, we have 
really, really big problems. 
We are not talking here about an 
exam room. We are not talking about 
procedures designed to promote, to 
heal, and to prolong life. We are talk-
ing about a procedure to end life. This 
is, itself, not a bill that talks about the 
appropriateness or lack thereof of elec-
tive abortion. This simply says that, 
given how many Americans feel about 
this, as many of us in this very room 
feel about abortion, we shouldn’t be 
subsidizing it, and we shouldn’t be pre-
tending it is something it is not. 
Finally, let me remind this body and 
anyone who may be watching from out-
side this body that, of the legislation 
we voted on this week, one of those 
pieces of legislation didn’t even involve 
abortion at all. It didn’t regulate any 
facet of abortion. It dealt only indi-
rectly with the topic of abortion, but it 
had nothing to do with the perform-
ance or availability of an abortion 
itself. 
It simply said that, when a baby is 
born, following or in the middle of a 
failed attempt at an abortion, if that 
baby is born alive, notwithstanding the 
attempt by the abortionist to kill the 
baby, that baby shouldn’t simply be ne-
glected. In any other circumstance, a 
human being, particularly a vulner-
able, brandnew newborn baby—an in-
fant—to neglect the baby and allow 
that baby to die of exposure, to not ad-
minister lifesaving care or nutrition or 
sustenance to that baby, to neglect the 
baby and allow that baby to die of ex-
posure would be a crime. In some cir-
cumstances, it may well be murder. In 
others, it would be a serious criminal 
form of deliberate child neglect. 
So, to suggest that a baby is some-
how different as a result of a subjective 
intent of the abortionist to kill the 
baby and that we shouldn’t make sure 
that baby is properly cared for fol-
lowing its birth is barbaric. Look, I get 
it. Not everybody shares my viewpoint 
with regard to when human life begins. 
I get it. Not everybody shares my view 
with regard to abortion policy. Now, I 
will defend to my dying day my views 
on these issues, and I will not shrink 
from them, but regardless of whether 
you agree with me on that, I seriously 
question how anyone would credibly 
maintain that a human being born 
alive following a failed abortion at-
tempt shouldn’t be given the same pro-
tection under the law as any other 
human being. 
In other words, the humanness of a 
baby shouldn’t depend on that baby’s 
‘‘wantedness.’’ The fact that anyone 
wanted to kill that baby before the 
baby was born doesn’t give anyone the 
right to kill the baby with impunity. 
That is what they voted down this 
week. Let’s not pretend that this is 
about exam rooms. Let’s not pretend 
that this is about actual healthcare. 
Let’s not pretend that this is somehow 
an anti-woman strategy. 
By the way, many women I know— 
most, I would say—actually find quite 
offensive the suggestion that to be in 
favor of protecting babies is somehow 
anti-woman. This is offensive. It is sad 
to me, more than anything. 
This was a lost opportunity that we 
had this week to protect the dignity of 
human life, not just unborn human life 
but human beings who have been born. 
One day we will look back and see 
this week through sad eyes in much 
the same way we now look back on 
other episodes in American history 
where we have failed to accord the full 
dignity to a human life that each 
human life truly deserves.

VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
HISTORIC 
SEATING 
OF 
HIRAM 
RHODES 
REVELS AS THE FIRST AFRICAN 
AMERICAN UNITED STATES SEN-
ATOR 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, as Black 
History Month comes to a close in our 
land, I rise this afternoon to draw at-
tention to the fact that the first Afri-
can-American U.S. Senator in our Re-
public’s history was Hiram Rhodes 
Revels of my State of Mississippi. 
As a matter of fact, 150 years ago this 
week, history was made in this very 
room when Hiram Rhodes Revels took 
the oath of office and broke the color 
barrier in the U.S. Senate. There was 
celebration. There was a congratula-
tion on both sides of the aisle, but it 
was not unanimous. As a matter of 
fact, eight Senators objected to the 
seating of Hiram Revels as a U.S. Sen-
ator, simply because he was a Black 
man. Thank goodness it was only eight 
and that position did not prevail, and 
Hiram 
Revels 
entered 
the 
history 
books of the United States of America 
as being our first African-American 
Senator. 
In a moment, I will ask unanimous 
consent for the consideration of a reso-
lution commemorating this momen-
tous occasion, some 150 years ago this 
week. I will not read the entire resolu-
tion that I have, but I point out that I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1176 
February 27, 2020 
have a resolution cosponsored on a 
very bipartisan basis by 71 of my fellow 
Senators. 
Pointing out a few things about the 
history of this extraordinary public 
servant, this giant of American his-
tory, Hiram Rhodes Revels was born a 
free African American in 1827 in Fay-
etteville, Cumberland County, NC. He 
was well-educated in a number of 
States, including North Carolina, Indi-
ana, Ohio, and Illinois. Then he entered 
the ministry, where he served in Mary-
land and in Missouri and, eventually, 
of course, coming to the State of Mis-
sissippi. 
By 1868, the Reverend Hiram Rhodes 
Revels 
was 
also 
Alderman 
Hiram 
Rhodes Revels in Natchez, MS, and he 
went on to a career of public service. 
Then, the legislature, which made 
those decisions in that time under our 
U.S. Constitution, chose Reverend Rev-
els to come to Washington, DC, and 
serve as a Senator. 
He served capably. He was well re-
ceived 
and 
well 
admired, 
and 
he 
brought a degree of conciliation and to-
getherness to this Senate that we had 
not had before. He only served a little 
over a year. He chose, instead, to re-
turn to Mississippi to become a college 
president, continue in education, and 
continue in the ministry in Mississippi, 
having served as president of what is 
now Alcorn State University and also 
having served in Holly Springs, MS, in 
what is now Rust College. He was in 
the ministry in Aberdeen, MS, at the 
time of his death and is buried in Holly 
Springs, MS. 
I very much appreciate the help of 
Democrats and Republicans in getting 
this resolution right. There have only 
been 10 African Americans in the his-
tory of our Republic to serve in the 
U.S. Senate. One of them—the first 
one—was Hiram Rhodes Revels. Three 
of them are serving today in the U.S. 
Senate. 
I will acknowledge the help that I re-
ceived from a number of my colleagues 
in adding information to this resolu-
tion to make it better and fuller and 
more complete. I appreciate the bipar-
tisan cosponsorship of this but also the 
bipartisan suggestions that I received 
and incorporated into the resolution to 
make it better. 
I am honored to represent the same 
State that this pioneer represented and 
began to represent some 150 years ago 
this week. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent for the Senate to proceed to the 
consideration of S. Res. 508, submitted 
earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 508) commemorating 
the 150th anniversary of the historic seating 
of Hiram Rhodes Revels as the first African 
American United States Senator. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resolution 
be agreed to, the preamble be agreed 
to, and the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 508) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to.

printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The Senator from Ohio. 
WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, over and 
over, we see the President and Repub-
licans in Congress trying to take 
healthcare away from people, particu-
larly women. We see it with the Presi-
dent’s lawsuits, trying to take away 
the 
consumer 
protections 
for 
pre-
existing conditions. We see the vote in 
the Senate—defeated by one vote, but a 
vote in the Senate—which would have 
scaled back the bipartisan Medicaid ex-
pansion in Ohio that my Republican 
Governor—I am a Democrat—and we 
did bipartisanly in Ohio. We have seen 
attempts by Republicans to take away 
healthcare then, and now we—espe-
cially just this week—see that with 
women’s healthcare. That is what the 
bills we voted down this week were all 
about. They are about politicians put-
ting themselves in the middle of the sa-
cred doctor-patient relationship. It in-
timidates women, and it intimidates 
medical professionals. Doctors aren’t 
sure what might happen to them in 
some cases. It takes away the freedom 
of women to make their own decisions. 
We defeated them earlier this week, 
but they are not letting up. They tried 
again to pass yet another bill that has 
only one purpose: stigmatizing wom-
en’s healthcare. 
Supporters of these bills, including 
the President of the United States, 
have spread lies and misinformation. It 
is despicable. That is why doctors and 
medical experts alike oppose these 
bills. 
Think about these groups: the Amer-
ican College of Nurse-Midwives, Amer-
ican College of Obstetricians and Gyne-
cologists, the American Medical Wom-
en’s Association, the American Public 
Health Association—on whom we rely 
so much now on the coronavirus—the 
American Society for Reproductive 
Medicine, and the Association of Physi-
cian Assistants in Obstetrics and Gyne-
cology. All of these organizations op-
pose this bill because they see it for 
what it is: a compromise of women’s 
health. It is politicians, it is elected of-
ficials in this body, it is Leader MCCON-
NELL from his office down the hall al-
ways playing to his interest groups, al-
ways playing politics. It is Senator 
MCCONNELL and his allies getting be-
tween the patient—the woman—and 
her doctor, as if mostly male politi-
cians should be making these decisions 
about women’s lives and about the re-
lationship between a woman and her 
doctor. 
All of these groups that I mentioned, 
again, the American College of Nurse- 
Midwives, American College of Obste-
tricians and Gynecologists, American 
Medical Women’s Association, Amer-
ican Public Health Association—all of 
these groups have written in to oppose 
politicians interfering in the patient- 
provider relationship and the criminal-
izing of patient care. Do we want a 
bunch of male politicians, do we want 
people like President Trump and Vice 
President PENCE from the Presiding Of-
ficer’s home State, and do we want a 
bunch of politicians like MITCH MCCON-
NELL—do we want them to be able to 
criminalize a doctor, get in the middle 
of a patient-doctor relationship and 
criminalize that? There is no question 
that is what this is about. 
They act as though they know better 
than you—a woman—and your doctor. 
It is nothing new. We have seen it over 
and over. We have seen Washington 
politicians, we see Columbus politi-
cians in my State, most of them men, 
obsessed with trying to assert them-
selves into women’s healthcare deci-
sions. They can’t help themselves. 
They just keep doing it. Those deci-
sions should be and are between a 
woman and her doctor, period. 
It is time, if I can say this, that old 
men in Washington and in courtrooms 
and in State legislatures stop trying to 
take away women’s healthcare, par-
ticularly when we have so much work 
to do in healthcare. 
We could be working instead of a 
bunch of votes—I mean, I understand; 
we know Senator MCCONNELL is in his 
office down the hall, and we know what 
he does. We know he brings forward 
legislation to get his base excited, to 
make sure the most conservative vot-
ers in the country come out to vote. 
We know he does legislation all the 
time to help his big financial contribu-
tors—to help the drug companies, to 
help the insurance companies, to help 
the gun lobby. We know that is what 
MITCH MCCONNELL does. 
Instead of trying to compromise 
women’s health, take healthcare away, 
instead of eliminating consumer pro-
tections for preexisting conditions, he 
could actually do something about 
drug prices. We could be working to 
protect the millions of Americans with 
preexisting conditions. 
In this country, 10 years ago, we 
passed a bill which said that if you are 
sick—you are really sick—and you 
spend a lot of money on healthcare, 
your health insurance company in the 
past would just cut your insurance off 
and you were out of luck. You would 
then choose between going to the doc-
tor or not and all that can happen or 
you go bankrupt. We changed that. The 
Affordable Care Act said: No, you 
can’t. Just because you are sick and 
you are expensive, an insurance com-
pany can’t take your insurance away. 
They can’t cancel it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1177 
February 27, 2020 
President Trump has tried for 3 years 
now to change that and take away 
those consumer protections. He has 
gotten support from MITCH MCCONNELL 
and from virtually almost every—ex-
cept for John McCain and a couple of 
other Senators from their side—almost 
every Republican in this Senate to say 
that it is OK to take away consumer 
protections for preexisting conditions. 
Instead of doing that, we could work 
to keep drug prices down. We could 
give tax credits to help people afford 
insurance. We could protect the ability 
to stay on your parents’ healthcare. If 
you are 25 years old, you could be on 
your parents’ health insurance. They 
are trying to take that away. They are 
trying to take Medicaid expansion 
away. 
They are trying to make limits on 
how much you pay out of pocket each 
year. Those are the kinds of things we 
should be agreeing on. 
Free preventive screening services— 
if you are a senior, if you are on Medi-
care, you can get free screening for 
osteoporosis, free screening for diabe-
tes. The President and this Congress 
tried to take those services away. 
Five million Ohioans under 65 have 
preexisting conditions. Basically, if 
you are over 50 in this country, the 
chances are overwhelming that you 
have a preexisting condition. Do you 
want to lose those consumer protec-
tions? Of course not. 
Instead of making it harder for Ohio 
women to get the care they need, in-
stead of tearing down the Affordable 
Care Act, let’s make it stronger. Let’s 
get drug prices under control. Let’s tell 
American women we trust them; we 
trust them to make their own deci-
sions.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate be in a period of morning business, 
with Senators permitted to speak 
therein for up to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
(At the request of Mr. SCHUMER, the 
following statement was ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD.) 
f 
VOTE EXPLANATION 
∑ Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was 
necessarily absent for roll call vote No. 
62, confirmation of the nomination of 
Travis Greaves to be a judge for the 
U.S. Tax Court. As I did on cloture, had 
I been present for the vote, I would 
have voted yea.∑ 
(At the request of Mr. SCHUMER, the 
following statement was ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD.) 
f 
WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE 
∑ Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today in opposition to the two bills 
that the Senate considered this week 
that would severely restrict women’s 
access to reproductive healthcare. I 
have always believed that a woman’s 
most personal and difficult medical de-
cisions should be made with her doctor 
and her family and free from political 
interference. 
These bills would prevent doctors 
from providing a full range of repro-
ductive healthcare that meets the 
needs of their patients. These bills put 
women’s health at risk, which is why 
they are opposed by groups that rep-
resent healthcare professionals, includ-
ing the American Public Health Asso-
ciation. They would also disproportion-
ately impact women of color, LGBTQ 
people, those facing intimate partner 
violence, and those living in rural 
areas. 
All Americans deserve access to af-
fordable, high-quality healthcare, in-
cluding the full range of reproductive 
healthcare. It is for these reasons that 
I oppose the motions to invoke cloture 
on these bills.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1179 
February 27, 2020 
BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to 
submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for February 2020. 
This is my fourth scorekeeping report 
since I filed the deemed budget resolu-
tion for fiscal year 2020 on September 9, 
2019, as required by the Bipartisan 
Budget Act of 2019, BBA19. The report 
compares current-law levels of spend-
ing and revenues with the amounts 
agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this 
information 
is 
used 
to 
determine 
whether budgetary points of order lie 
against pending legislation. The Re-
publican staff of the Budget Committee 
and the Congressional Budget Office, 
CBO, prepared this report pursuant to 
section 308(b) of the Congressional 
Budget Act, CBA. The information in-
cluded in this report is current through 
February 21, 2020. 
Since I filed the last scorekeeping re-
port on January 15, 2020, only one 
measure was enacted with significant 
budgetary effects. On January 29, 2020, 
the President signed H.R. 5430, the 
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment—USMCA—Implementation 
Act, 
into law. The measure implemented 
the USMCA and affected both revenue 
and spending. According to CBO, the 
USMCA Implementation Act will de-
crease direct spending outlays by $74 
million over 10 years and increase reve-
nues by nearly $3 billion over the same 
period. Direct spending effects are 
largely attributable to the act’s provi-
sions related to the dairy industry, 
while revenues are expected to increase 
due to higher receipts from tariffs on 
motor vehicles and parts. The USMCA 
Implementation Act also included $843 
million 
in 
discretionary 
appropria-
tions, designated as emergency spend-
ing, for Federal agencies to execute the 
agreement. 
Budget Committee Republican staff 
prepared tables A–D. 
Table A gives the amount by which 
each Senate authorizing committee ex-
ceeds or falls below its allocations for 
budget authority and outlays under the 
fiscal year 2020 deemed budget resolu-
tion. This information is used for en-
forcing committee allocations pursu-
ant to section 302 of the CBA. Legisla-
tion enacted since the enactment of 
BBA19 has resulted in six authorizing 
committees being in breach of their al-
locations. The direct spending effects 
of the USMCA Implementation Act 
were credited to the Finance Com-
mittee, which continues to violate its 
allocation over all enforceable periods. 
In total, authorizing committees have 
breached outlay limitations by more 
than $29 billion over the 2020 through 
2029 period. 
Table B provides the amount by 
which the Senate Committee on Appro-
priations is below or exceeds the statu-
tory spending limits. This information 
is used to determine points of order re-
lated to the spending caps found in sec-
tions 312 and 314 of the CBA. The table 
shows that the Appropriations Com-
mittee is compliant with spending lim-
its for current the fiscal year. Those 
limits for regular discretionary spend-
ing are $666.5 billion for accounts in the 
defense category and $621.5 billion for 
accounts in the nondefense category of 
spending. 
The 2018 budget resolution contained 
points of order limiting the use of 
changes 
in 
mandatory 
programs, 
CHIMPs, in appropriations bills. Table 
C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 
billion for 2020, shows the Appropria-
tions Committee has complied with the 
CHIMP limit for this fiscal year. 
Table D provides the amount of budg-
et authority enacted for 2020 that has 
been designated as either for an emer-
gency or for overseas contingency oper-
ations, 
OCO, 
pursuant 
to 
section 
251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, 
as amended. Funding that receives ei-
ther of these designations results in 
cap adjustments to enforceable discre-
tionary spending limits. There is no 
limit on either emergency or overseas 
contingency operations spending; how-
ever, any Senator may challenge the 
designation with a point of order to 
strike the designation on the floor. The 
addition of $843 million in emergency- 
designated funds from P.L. 116–113 
brings total emergency and OCO spend-
ing to $88.9 billion for the 2020 appro-
priations cycle. 
In addition to the tables provided by 
Budget Committee Republican staff, I 
am submitting CBO tables, which I will 
use to enforce budget totals approved 
by Congress. 
CBO provided a spending and revenue 
report for 2020, Table 1, which helps en-
force aggregate spending levels in 
budget resolutions under CBA section 
311. The current level is now in excess 
of allowable levels by $15.4 billion for 
budget authority and $1.7 billion for 
outlays in 2020. Details on 2020 levels 
can be found in CBO’s second table. 
Current-law revenues are currently 
below enforceable levels for all enforce-
ment periods. Revenues are currently 
$34.4 billion, $150 billion, and $383.2 bil-
lion lower than assumed in the deemed 
budget resolution for 2020, 2020 through 
2024, and 2020 through 2029, respec-
tively. 
Social Security spending levels are 
consistent with the budget resolution’s 
figures for 2020; however, Social Secu-
rity revenue levels are $15 million 
below assumed levels. CBO’s report 
also provides information needed to en-
force 
the 
Senate 
pay-as-you-go, 
PAYGO, rule, Table 3. This rule is en-
forced under section 4106 of the 2018 
budget resolution. The Senate PAYGO 
scorecard currently shows an enacted 
deficit decrease of $984 million in 2020, 
but enacted deficit increases of $361 
million and $2.2 billion over the 2019– 
2024 and 2019–2029 periods, respectively. 
The deficit effects of the USMCA Im-
plementation Act do not include the 
amounts designated as supplemental 
appropriations because those amounts 
are recorded as discretionary spending, 
which is not recorded on the Senate’s 
PAYGO scorecard. 
This submission also includes a table 
tracking the Senate’s budget enforce-
ment activity on the floor since the en-
forcement filing on September 9, 2019. 
Since my last filing, one point of order 
was raised. On January 16, 2020, Sen-
ator TOOMEY raised a point of order 
against the emergency designations in 
the supplemental appropriations title 
of the USMCA Implementation Act. 
That point of order was waived by a 
vote of 78–21. 
All years in the accompanying tables 
are fiscal years. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

1 Security spending is defined as spending in the National Defense budget function (050) and nonsecurity spending is defined as all other spending. 
2 The Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2019 was enacted after the publication of CBO’s May 2019 baseline but before the Senate Budget Committee Chairman published the deemed budget resolution for 
2020 in the Congressional Record. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, the budgetary effects of this legislation have been incorporated into the current level as previously enacted funds. 
U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
Washington, DC, February 26, 2020. 
Hon. MIKE ENZI, 
Chairman, Committee on the Budget, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report 
shows the effects of Congressional action on 
the fiscal year 2020 budget and is current 
through February 21, 2020. This report is sub-
mitted under section 308(b) and in aid of sec-
tion 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as 
amended. 
The estimates of budget authority, out-
lays, and revenues are consistent with the 
allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary 
levels printed in the Congressional Record on 
September 9, 2019, pursuant to section 204 of 
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (Public 
Law 116–37). 
Since our last letter dated January 15, 2020, 
the Congress has cleared, and the President 
has signed, the United States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement Implementation Act (P.L. 116– 
113). That Act has significant effects on 
budget authority and outlays in fiscal year 
2020. 
Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL, 
Director. 
Enclosure.

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and lmpoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $567 million in budget authority and $798 million in estimated outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in 
this current level report do not include those items. 
c Section 124 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020 (division A of P.L. 116–59), appropriated funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Defense) and designated those 
amounts as funding for overseas contingency operations. That provision took effect upon enactment on September 27, 2019. 
d In consultation with the House and Senate Committees on the Budget and the Office of Management and Budget, rescissions of emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 
251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 shall not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:

e Section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 requires the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget to publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2020; those aggregate levels were first published 
in the Congressional Record on September 9, 2019. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget has the authority to revise the budgetary aggregates for the budgetary effects of certain revenue and spending measures pursuant 
to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and H.Con.Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, as updated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019.

Jordan—Artillery Command, Control and 
Communications (C3) Equipment 
The Government of Jordan has requested 
to buy up to seven hundred (700) Advanced 
Field 
Artillery 
Tactical 
Data 
System 
(AFATDS) software license copies with a tai-
lored, international ballistic kernel. Also in-
cluded are up to two hundred (200) each 
laptop and table computers, ancillary com-
puter mounting hardware, battery kits and 
chargers, printers, scanners, network routers 
and communication hardware, moderns, two 
hundred fifty (250) each diesel fueled 5 kilo-
watt auxiliary power units (APUs), one hun-
dred (100) each diesel fueled electrical power 
generators, fifty (50) each model 7800–HF 150– 
Watt high frequency radios, five hundred 
(500) each model 7850–MB 50–Watt multiband 
(UHF & VHF) radios, five hundred fifty (550) 
each model 7850–MB IO-Watt multiband 
(UHF & VHF) radios, all the required cables 
and components, required engineering and 
installation services, operations, integra-
tion, and maintenance services, contractor 
furnished support, communications support 
equipment, tools and test equipment, train-
ing, U.S. Government technical/logistical 
Support, 
contractor 
technical 
support, 
spares and support equipment, and other re-
lated elements of logistical and program sup-
port services. The estimated cost is $300 mil-
lion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
an important Major Non-NATO ally in the 
region. This sale is consistent with U.S. ini-
tiatives to provide key partners in the region 
with modern systems that will enhance 
interoperability with U.S. forces and in-
crease security. 
The proposed upgrade will allow the Jor-
dan Armed Forces (JAF) to fire Guided Mul-
tiple Launch Rocket System-Alternative 
Warhead (GMLRS–AW) rockets using a dig-
ital fire control system. The expansion will 
ensure uniformity among all indirect fire 
systems used by the JAF. The upgrade and 
expansion of the AFATDS fire control sys-
tem will allow the JAF to defend its borders 
and ground forces with indirect fire weapon 
systems. This proposed sale will advance the 
JAF’s efforts to modernize its military and 
to enhance interoperability with U.S., allied, 
and coalition military forces. Jordan will 
have no difficulty absorbing these defense 
articles and services into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale will not alter the basic 
military balance in the region. 
The prime contractors for the AFATDS 
and supporting equipment include Raytheon 
Company and the Harris Company. There are 
no known offset agreements in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this sale will not re-
quire the assignment of any U.S. Govern-
ment or contractor representatives to Jor-
dan. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Netherlands—MK–48 Torpedo Conversion 
Kits 
The Government of the Netherlands has re-
quested to buy sixteen (16) MK–48 Mod 7 Ad-
vanced Technology (AT) torpedo conversion 
kits. Also included are spare parts, con-
tainers, associated hardware, torpedo han-
dling equipment, and cables; U.S. Govern-
ment and contractor engineering, technical, 
and logistics support services; and other re-
lated elements of logistics and program sup-
port. The total estimated program cost is $85 
million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve security of a 
NATO ally which is an important force for 
political stability and economic progress in 
Northern Europe. 
The Netherlands desires to upgrade addi-
tional MK 48 Mod 4 torpedoes to the MK 48 
Mod 7 AT model. They intend to use the MK 
48 Mod 7 AT torpedo on their Walrus Class 
submarines. The Netherlands will have no 
difficulty absorbing this equipment into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment will 
not alter the basic military balance in the 
region. 
The prime contractor will be Raytheon 
Company, Portsmouth, RI. The Netherlands 
may require offset agreements in connection 
with this potential sale. Any offset agree-
ment will be defined in negotiations between 
the Purchaser and the prime contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the Netherlands. Travel of U.S. Gov-
ernment or contractor representatives to the 
Netherlands on a temporary basis for pro-
gram technical support and management 
oversight will be required. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Mod 7 configuration is the United 
States 
Navy’s 
most 
capable 
submarine 
launched torpedo. It has a new sonar receiver 
that has a broader bandwidth capability 
than previous versions, and also employs a 
new tactical processor that has increased 
memory and throughput. The Mod 7AT con-
figuration has the same guidance and control 
system and the same software as the Mod 7. 
However, it employs the Mod 4M afterbody 
which results in higher radiated noise. 
2. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
3. A determination has been made that the 
Netherlands can provide substantially the 
same degree of protection for the technology 
being released as the U.S. Government. This 
proposed sustainment program is necessary 
to the furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy 
and national security objectives as outlined 
in the Policy Justification. 
4. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Netherlands.

IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent to have my opinion 
memorandum in the impeachment trial 
of President Donald John Trump print-
ed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
OPINION
MEMORANDUM
OF
UNITED
STATES 
SENATOR JOHN F. REED
IN
THE IMPEACH-
MENT TRIAL
OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN 
TRUMP 
I. FINDINGS 
Based on the evidence in the record, the ar-
guments of the House Impeachment Man-
agers, and the arguments of the President’s 
Counsel, I conclude as follows: The President 
has violated his constitutional oath to ‘‘take 
care that the laws be faithfully executed’’ 
and placed his personal and political inter-
ests above the interests of the United States. 
The House Impeachment Managers have 
proven that the President’s abuse of power 
and congressional obstruction amount to the 
constitutional standard of ‘‘high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors’’ for which the sole remedy is 
conviction and removal from office. 
II. STATEMENT OF THE FACTS 
On December 18, 2019, the United States 
House of Representatives passed H. Res. 755,1 
‘‘Impeaching Donald John Trump, President 
of the United States, for high crimes and 
misdemeanors.’’ H. Res. 755 contains two Ar-
ticles of Impeachment. The first Article de-
clares that the President abused his power 
by soliciting foreign interference to help his 
bid for reelection in the 2020 United States 
presidential 
election 
and 
conditioning 
United States government acts of significant 
value on the foreign power’s cooperation. 
The second Article declares that the Presi-
dent obstructed Congress by directing the 
categorical, indiscriminate defiance of sub-
poenas for witness testimony and documents 
deemed vital to the House Impeachment in-
quiry. 
Pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of the 
United 
States 
Constitution, 
the 
United 
States Senate convened as a Court of Im-
peachment on January 16, 2020, and each 
Senator took an oath to ‘‘do impartial jus-
tice according to the Constitution and 
laws.’’ 2 Alexander Hamilton spoke about the 
Senate’s role in an Impeachment trial in 
Federalist Paper No. 65, when he wrote, 
‘‘What other body would be likely to feel 
confidence enough in its own situation, to pre-
serve unawed and uninfluenced the necessary 
impartiality between an individual accused 
and the representatives of the people, his accus-
ers?’’ 3 
The obligation of the Senate is to accord 
the President, as the accused, the right to 
conduct his defense fairly, while respecting 
the House’s exclusive constitutional preroga-
tive to bring Articles of Impeachment. At 
the core of the Senate’s task is the funda-
mental understanding that our system of 
laws recognizes the rights of defendants and 
the responsibilities of the prosecution to 
prove its case. Such a basic tenet of our law 
and our experience as a free people does not 
evaporate in the rarified atmosphere of a 
Court of Impeachment, simply because the 
accused is the President and the accuser is 
the House of Representatives. 
III. THE CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS FOR 
IMPEACHMENT 
‘‘The Senate shall have the sole Power to 
try all Impeachments.’’ 4
With these few 
words, the Framers of the Constitution en-
trusted the Senate with the most awesome 
power within a democratic society: whether 
to remove an impeached President from of-
fice. 
A. High Crimes and Misdemeanors 
The Constitution states, ‘‘The President, 
Vice President and all civil Officers of the 
United States, shall be removed from Office 
on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, 
Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors.’’ 5 
‘‘Treason’’ and ‘‘Bribery’’ are foundational 
impeachable offenses. No more heinous ex-
ample of an offense against the constitu-
tional order exists than betrayal of the na-
tion to an enemy or betrayal of duty for per-
sonal enrichment. A President commits trea-
son when he levies war against the United 
States or gives comfort or aid to its en-
emies.6 As the House Judiciary Committee 
explains, a President engages in impeachable 
bribery when he ‘‘offers, solicits, or accepts

own official actions.’’ 7

demeanors,’’ we must not only look to the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1185 
February 27, 2020 
Federalist Papers and the records of the Con-
stitutional Convention, but also to the con-
temporary and foundational writings on Im-
peachment available to the Framers. 
Sir William Blackstone, whose influential 
Commentaries on the Laws of England were 
published from 1765–1770, discussed a classi-
fication of crimes he termed ‘‘public wrongs, 
or crimes and misdemeanors’’ that he de-
fined as breaches of the public duty that an 
individual owed to their entire community.8 
Blackstone viewed treason, murder, and rob-
bery as ‘‘public wrongs’’ not only because 
they cause injury to individuals but also be-
cause they ‘‘strike at the very being of soci-
ety.’’ 9 
Richard Wooddeson, a legal scholar who 
began giving lectures on English law in 1777, 
defined impeachable offenses as misdeeds 
that fail to clearly fall under the jurisdiction 
of ordinary tribunals. These wrongs were 
‘‘abuse[s] of high offices of trust’’ that dam-
aged the commonwealth.10 
Much 
the 
same 
as 
Blackstone 
and 
Wooddeson, Alexander Hamilton included 
the dual components of abuse of public trust 
and national harm in his definition of im-
peachable crimes and misdemeanors. In Fed-
eralist Paper No. 65, Hamilton defined an im-
peachable offense as ‘‘those offenses which 
proceed from the misconduct of public men, 
or in other words from the abuse or violation 
of some public trust. They are of a nature 
which may with peculiar propriety be de-
nominated POLITICAL, as they relate chief-
ly to injuries done immediately to the soci-
ety itself.’’ 11 
B. The Constitutional Debates 
Adding impressive support to these con-
sistent views of the meaning of the constitu-
tional 
term, 
‘‘high 
Crimes 
and 
Mis-
demeanors,’’ is the history of the delibera-
tions at the Constitutional Convention. 
The convention delegates considered lim-
iting Impeachment to treason and bribery. 
However, they concluded that these enumer-
ated offenses alone could not anticipate 
every manner of profound misconduct that a 
future President might engage in.12 George 
Mason, a delegate from Virginia, declared 
that ‘‘high crimes and misdemeanors’’ would 
be an apt way to further capture ‘‘great and 
dangerous offences’’ or ‘‘[a]ttempts to sub-
vert the Constitution.’’ 13 
This wording would also set the nec-
essarily high threshold for Impeachment 
that would be proportional to the severe 
punishment of removing an elected official 
and disqualification from holding future pub-
lic office. 
Further insight is provided by James 
Iredell, a delegate to the North Carolina 
Convention that ratified the Constitution, 
who later served as a Justice of the United 
States Supreme Court. During the Conven-
tion debates, Iredell stated: 
The power of impeachment is given by this 
Constitution, to bring great offenders to 
punishment . . . This power is lodged in 
those who represent the great body of the 
people, because the occasion for its exercise 
will arise from acts of great injury to the 
community, and the objects of it may be 
such as cannot be easily reached by an ordi-
nary tribunal.14 
Iredell’s understanding sustains the view 
that an impeachable offense must cause 
‘‘great injury to the community.’’ Private 
wrongdoing, without a significant, adverse 
effect upon the nation, cannot constitute an 
impeachable offense. James Wilson, a dele-
gate to the Federal Constitutional Conven-
tion and, like Iredell, later a Supreme Court 
Justice, wrote that Impeachments are ‘‘pro-
ceedings of a political nature . . . confined to 
political characters, to political crimes and 
misdemeanors, 
and 
to 
political 
punish-
ments.’’ 15 
Later 
commentators 
expressed 
similar 
views. In 1833, Justice Joseph Story quoted 
favorably from the scholarship of William 
Rawle, who concluded that the ‘‘legitimate 
causes of impeachment . . . can have ref-
erence only to public character, and official 
duty . . . In general, those offenses, which 
may be committed equally by a private per-
son, as a public officer, are not the subject of 
impeachment.’’ 16 
This line of reasoning is buttressed by the 
careful and thoughtful work of the House of 
Representatives during the Watergate pro-
ceedings. The Democratic staff of the House 
Judiciary Committee concluded that, ‘‘Be-
cause impeachment of a President is a grave 
step for the nation, it is to be predicated 
only upon conduct seriously incompatible 
with either the constitutional form and prin-
ciples of our government or the proper per-
formance of constitutional duties of the 
presidential office.’’ 17 
The deliberations at the Constitutional 
Convention also demonstrate a conscious 
movement to narrow the terminology as a 
means of raising the threshold for the Im-
peachment process to require an offense 
against the State. 
Early in the debate on the issue of presi-
dential Impeachment in July of 1787, it was 
suggested that Impeachment and removal 
could be founded on a showing of ‘‘mal-
practice,’’ ‘‘neglect of duty,’’ or ‘‘corrup-
tion.’’ 18 By September of 1787, the issue of 
presidential Impeachment had been referred 
to the Committee of Eleven, which was cre-
ated to resolve the most contentious issues. 
The Committee of Eleven considered wheth-
er the grounds for Impeachment should be 
‘‘treason or bribery.’’ 19
This was signifi-
cantly more restricted than the amorphous 
standard of ‘‘malpractice,’’ too restricted, in 
fact, for some delegates. George Mason ob-
jected and suggested that ‘‘maladministra-
tion’’ be added to ‘‘treason and bribery.’’ 20 
This suggestion was opposed by Madison as 
being ‘‘equivalent to a tenure during pleas-
ure of the Senate.’’ 21 Mason responded by 
further refining his suggestion and offered 
the term ‘‘other high crimes and mis-
demeanors against the State.’’ 22 The Mason 
language was a clear reference to the English 
legal history of Impeachment. Mason’s pro-
posal explicitly narrowed these offenses to 
those ‘‘against the State.’’ The Convention 
itself further clarified the standard by re-
placing ‘‘State’’ with the ‘‘United States.’’ 23 
At the conclusion of the substantive delib-
erations on the constitutional standard of 
Impeachment, it was obvious that only seri-
ous offenses against the governmental sys-
tem would justify Impeachment and subse-
quent removal from office. However, the 
final stylistic touches to the Constitution 
were applied by the Committee of Style. 
This Committee had no authority to alter 
the meaning of the carefully debated lan-
guage, but could only impose a stylistic con-
sistency through, among other things, the 
elimination of redundancy. In its zeal to 
streamline the text, the words ‘‘against the 
United States’’ were eliminated as unneces-
sary to the meaning of the passage.24 
The weight of both authoritative com-
mentary and the history of the Constitu-
tional Convention combines to provide con-
vincing proof that the Impeachment process 
was reserved for serious breaches of the con-
stitutional order that threaten the country 
in a direct and immediate manner. 
C. An Impeachable Offense is Not Limited to 
Criminal Liability or A Defined Offense 
In the case before us, the President’s Coun-
sel wholly reject a longstanding under-
standing of Impeachment, by arguing that 
abuse of power is not an impeachable offense 
and by positing that ‘‘the Framers restricted 
impeachment to specific offenses against ‘al-
ready known and established law.’ ’’ 25 
This assertion is clearly wrong. Article I, 
Section 3 of the United States Constitution 
provides that ‘‘Judgment in Cases of Im-
peachment shall not extend further than to 
removal from Office, and disqualification to 
hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or 
Profit under the United States: but the 
Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable 
and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment 
and Punishment, according to Law.’’ 26 As 
Delegate James Wilson wrote, ‘‘impeach-
ments, and offenses and offenders impeach-
able ‘‘[do not come] within the sphere of or-
dinary jurisprudence. They are founded on 
different principles, are governed by dif-
ferent maxims, and are directed to different 
objects: for this reason, the trial and punish-
ment of an offense on an impeachment, is no 
bar to a trial and punishment of the same of-
fence at common law.’’ 27 The independence 
of the Impeachment process from the pros-
ecution of crimes underscores the function of 
Impeachment as a means to remove a Presi-
dent from office, not only because of crimi-
nal behavior, but because the President 
poses a threat to the constitutional order. 
Criminal behavior is not irrelevant to an Im-
peachment, but it only becomes decisive if 
that behavior imperils the balance of powers 
established in the Constitution. 
The assertion that an impeachable offense 
must be predicated on a criminal act goes 
against the well-established consensus of the 
legal community. For example, the argu-
ment by President’s Counsel is undercut by 
the President’s current Attorney General, 
William Barr. Mr. Barr wrote in a 2018 memo 
to the Department of Justice (DOJ) when he 
was still in private practice, that the Presi-
dent ‘‘is answerable for any abuses of discre-
tion and is ultimately subject to the judg-
ment of Congress through the impeachment 
process [which] means that the president is 
not the judge in his own cause.’’ 28 As Mr. 
Barr makes clear, Impeachment does not 
need to be based on a crime. 
Furthermore, the assertion that an im-
peachable offense must involve the violation 
of an ‘‘already known or established’’ law, 
even if not criminal, is not supported by the 
constitutional record. In advocating for the 
inclusion of Impeachment at the Constitu-
tional Convention, James Madison made the 
case that the country must be protected 
against any number of abuses that a Presi-
dent could engage in and which might cause 
permanent damage to the country. Madison 
wrote that: 
[It was] indispensable that some provision 
should be made for defending the Commu-
nity [against] the incapacity, negligence or 
perfidy of the chief Magistrate. The limita-
tion of the period of his service, was not a 
sufficient security . . . He might pervert his 
administration into a scheme of peculation 
or oppression. He might betray his trust to 
foreign powers.29 
Confining Impeachment to criminal or 
even codified offenses goes against the main-
stream consensus on the meaning of ‘‘high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ and would fail to 
capture the universe of harms to the con-
stitutional order in which a President could 
engage. 
D. Impeachment as a Remedy for Corrupting 
Foreign Influence 
The Founders were also gravely concerned 
about the dangers of foreign influence cor-
rupting our elections and interfering with 
the rule of law.30 The United States was then 
a fledging union that had just gained inde-
pendence from Britain, with help from the 
French during the American Revolution. As

such, the Founders rightly feared that for-
eign governments might try to exploit Amer-
ican politics in order to further their own in-
terests. During the Constitutional Conven-
tion, Elbridge Gerry, a delegate from Massa-
chusetts, warned that ‘‘[f]oreign powers will 
intermeddle in our affairs, and spare no 
expence to influence them.’’ 31 
The Founders were also acutely aware of 
the potential for public officials to betray 
their office to a foreign power, if the tempta-
tion were strong enough. Hamilton conceded 
in Federalist Paper No. 22 that ‘‘[o]ne of the 
weak sides of republics, among their numer-
ous advantages, is that they afford too easy 
an inlet to foreign corruption.’’ 32 In Hamil-
ton’s view, when ordinary men are elevated 
by their fellow citizens to high office, they 
‘‘may find compensations for betraying their 
trust, which to any but minds animated and 
guided by superior virtue, may appear to ex-
ceed the proportion of interest they have in 
the common stock, and to over-balance the 
obligations of duty. Hence it is that history 
furnishes us with so many mortifying exam-
ples of the prevalency of foreign corruption 
in republican governments.’’ 33 
E. Conclusion 
Authoritative commentary on, together 
with the structure of, the Constitution 
makes it clear that the term, ‘‘other high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors,’’ encompasses 
conduct that involves the President in the 
impermissible exercise of the powers of his 
office to upset the constitutional order. 
Moreover, since the essence of Impeachment 
is removal from office, rather than punish-
ment for offenses, there is a strong inference 
that the improper conduct must represent a 
continuing threat to the American people 
and the Constitution. It must be an episode 
that either cannot be dealt with in the 
Courts or that raises generalized concerns 
about the continued service of the President, 
as is the case presented here. 
IV. STANDARD OF PROOF 
In an Impeachment trial, each Senator has 
the obligation to establish the burden of 
proof he or she deems proper.34 The Founding 
Fathers believed maximum discretion was 
critical for Senators confronting the gravest 
of constitutional choices.35
Differentiating 
Impeachment from criminal trials, Alex-
ander Hamilton argued, in Federalist Paper 
No. 65, that Impeachments ‘‘can never be 
tied down by such strict rules . . . as in com-
mon cases serve to limit the discretion of 
courts in favor of personal security.’’ 36 In 
this regard, Hamilton further distinguished 
Impeachment proceedings from a criminal 
trial by stressing that an impeached official 
would be subject to the established rules of 
criminal prosecution after Impeachment.37 
During the Clinton Impeachment trial, I 
believed, as I do now, that the House Im-
peachment Managers bear the burden of 
proving their case.38 In that trial, the House 
Impeachment Managers asserted that the 
Senators should reach a conclusion utilizing 
a beyond a reasonable doubt standard before 
voting to convict the President. The House 
Impeachment Managers, explicitly stated, 
‘‘none of us, would argue . . . that the Presi-
dent should be removed from office unless 
you conclude he committed the crimes that 
he is alleged to have committed.’’ 39 I chose 
that standard of proof during that trial.40 As 
I stated then, ‘‘[h]ad the charges of th[at] 
case involved threats to our constitutional 
order not readily characterized by criminal 
charges, I would have been forced to further 
parse an exact standard. However, for all 
practical purposes, the Managers have them-
selves established the burden of proof in [the 
Clinton Impeachment] case.’’ 41 
As the charges in this case against Presi-
dent Trump cut to the core of our constitu-
tional order, I believe that I am now required 
to offer further analysis on which standard 
of proof to apply. 
While the House Impeachment Managers in 
the current trial did not provide a single 
standard of proof required for conviction and 
removal, it was clear that the bar they set 
was quite high, which is appropriate. How-
ever, what exact constitutional standard 
should be used remains debatable. Practical 
concerns related to utilizing the Impeach-
ment power should be considered when deter-
mining the standard of proof required. Too 
low of a standard may lead to removal, even 
if significant doubts exist. A ‘‘. . . high 
‘criminal’ standard of proof could mean, in 
practice, that a man could remain president 
whom every member of the Senate believed 
to be guilty of corruption, just because his 
guilt was not shown ‘beyond a reasonable 
doubt.’ ’’ 42 
When uncertain about the standard of 
proof to apply, it is worth reviewing the 
writings of eminent scholars. In doing so, I 
have found a closer approximation to what 
the standard should be in many Impeach-
ment trials as compared to those used in 
general legal practice: ‘‘ ‘[o]verwhelming pre-
ponderance of the evidence’ . . .’’ 43 Yet, I be-
lieve that the severity of removing a Presi-
dent of the United States warrants an even 
higher bar. As such, a definition slightly 
modified, but modeled on that proposed 
standard, is more applicable: overwhelm-
ingly clear and convincing evidence. 
This standard more closely comports with 
historical analysis of the Founders’ desire to 
separate criminal law and Impeachment, and 
the arguments made by scholars, while re-
flecting the serious constitutional harms al-
leged in the Articles of Impeachment before 
the Senate. Further, after review of sub-
stantive differences between the Articles of 
Impeachment that allege President Trump’s 
dire and ongoing threat to our constitutional 
order and the Articles of Impeachment lev-
ied against President Clinton—which could 
be more readily applied by analogy to crimi-
nal law—a different standard is clearly war-
ranted. In a future case, if Articles of Im-
peachment contain a set of facts or allega-
tions not contemplated in either the Clinton 
Impeachment trial or in this case, I will 
likely have to revisit this analysis. 
The Articles, embodied in H. Res. 755, ac-
cuse the President of abuse of power and ob-
struction of Congress. After reading the ma-
terials and hearing the arguments presented 
at trial, I conclude that the evidence pre-
sented at trial was more than compelling. In-
deed, it was overwhelmingly clear and con-
vincing. Having concluded that the charges 
of abuse of power and obstruction of Con-
gress rise to the level of ‘‘high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors,’’ an analysis of the specific 
charges is necessary. 
V. ARTICLE I: ABUSE OF POWER 
Article I of House Resolution 755 provides 
that, in the conduct of his office, the Presi-
dent abused his presidential powers, in viola-
tion of his constitutional duty to take care 
that the laws be faithfully executed, through 
a scheme, or course of conduct, to solicit in-
terference of a foreign government, Ukraine, 
in the 2020 U.S. presidential election for per-
sonal political gain. The scheme included 
President Trump soliciting the Government 
of Ukraine to publicly announce investiga-
tions that would influence the 2020 U.S. pres-
idential election to his advantage and the 
disadvantage of a potential political oppo-
nent in that election. Article I provides fur-
ther that President Trump, for corrupt pur-
poses, used the powers of the Office in a man-
ner that injured the vital national interests 
of the United States by harming the integ-
rity of the democratic process and compro-
mising U.S. national security. As I will fur-
ther explain, the conduct described in Arti-
cle I amounts to an abuse of power and shows 
that President Trump remains an ongoing 
threat to the national interest if allowed to 
remain in office. 
A. Abuse of Power Is an Impeachable Offense 
A 
cardinal 
American 
principle 
that 
emerged during the drafting of the Constitu-
tion is that no one is above the law. As dis-
cussed in the previous section, this principle 
was a chief subject of debate at the Constitu-
tional Convention. The Framers understood 
that power corrupts and they would need to 
build guardrails to protect the public good 
from a would-be authoritarian. The Framers 
were reacting to the overreach of King 
George III. 
Yet, the President’s Counsel argue that 
Impeachment is not an appropriate remedy 
for abuse of power, arguing that the Framers 
were not concerned about violations of the 
public trust. The President’s Counsel instead 
argue that the Framers were primarily con-
cerned about an Executive that would be be-
holden to a heavy-handed legislature. In-
deed, during the debates at the Constitu-
tional Convention, this fear was raised by 
opponents of Impeachment. Rufus King, a 
delegate from Massachusetts, said ‘‘[im-
peachment by Congress] would be destruc-
tive of his independence and of the principles 
of the Constitution. He relied on the vigor of 
the Executive as a great security for the 
public liberties.’’ 44
Clearly, King’s argu-
ments did not carry the day. 
In drafting the Constitution, the Framers 
had carefully calibrated the powers between 
Congress and the Executive. Ultimately, 
they decided that they could not leave the 
nation without any recourse against a Presi-
dent who would be in a unique and potent po-
sition to engage in any number of abusive 
acts. Without a mechanism to keep an out- 
of-control President in check, there was lit-
tle binding him to the law. Hamilton under-
scored the importance of the Impeachment 
process for holding the President liable by 
drawing a contrast with the British mon-
archy, for whom ‘‘there is no constitutional 
tribunal to which he is amenable.’’ 45 
George Mason, a delegate from Virginia, 
underscores abuse of power as one of the key 
reasons for the need for presidential Im-
peachment, asking ‘‘Shall any man be above 
Justice? Above all shall that man be above 
it, who can commit the most extensive injus-
tice?’’ 46 Edmund Randolph, another delegate 
from Virginia, concurred, noting that ‘‘[t]he 
Executive will have great opportunitys of 
abusing his power[,]’’ and in such instances 
‘‘[g]uilt wherever found ought to be pun-
ished.’’ 47 
The Framers debate on these matters was 
prescient, as public officials have, in fact, 
been found to have committed impeachable 
offenses including abuse of power. Most well- 
known, President Nixon resigned after the 
House 
Judiciary 
Committee 
(hereinafter 
known as ‘‘Judiciary Committee’’) found he 
had abused his powers on multiple occa-
sions.48 Three district judges were also im-
peached during the 20th century for abusing 
their power. In impeaching these judges, the 
House used ‘‘abuse of power’’ to describe mis-
conduct ranging from the unlawful use of 
contempt of court, to the ordering of a jury 
to find a defendant guilty, to the improper 
appointing of an associate to an official posi-
tion.49 
In stark contrast to the positions of the 
Framers, the President’s Counsel argue that 
a President who does something to benefit 
himself in a reelection, if he thinks it is in 
the nation’s interest, has not committed an 
impeachable offense. This is not a credible 
argument because under this view, the Presi-
dent would have free reign to solicit foreign

interference, unlawfully withhold security 
assistance, use his powers to target his polit-
ical opponents and engage in a whole host of 
corrupt conduct that might help him get re-
elected. This rings all too familiar of Presi-
dent Nixon when he said ‘‘Well, when the 
president does it that means that it is not ille-
gal.’’ 50 
A.1. Definition of Abuse of Power 
Black’s Law Dictionary defines ‘‘abuse of 
power’’ as including ‘‘The misuse or im-
proper exercise of one’s authority; esp., the 
exercise of a statutorily or otherwise duly 
conferred authority in a way that is tortious, 
unlawful or outside its proper scope.’’ 51 
In its Impeachment inquiry of President 
Richard Nixon, the Judiciary Committee 
found the President repeatedly abused his 
power while in office.52 Among its findings, 
the Judiciary Committee determined that 
President Nixon unlawfully directed or au-
thorized federal agencies, including the In-
ternal Revenue Service and the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation, to investigate and sur-
veil American citizens, and used the result-
ing information for his own political pur-
poses.53
The Judiciary Committee further 
found that Nixon then interfered with inves-
tigations into these and other actions to 
conceal his misconduct, and stressed that 
Nixon’s actions in all of these instances 
‘‘served no valid national policy objec-
tive.’’ 54 
The Judiciary Committee concluded that 
the ‘‘conduct of Richard M. Nixon has con-
stituted a repeated and continuing abuse of 
the powers of the presidency in disregard of 
the fundamental principle of the rule of law 
in our system of government. This abuse of 
the powers of the President was carried out 
by Richard M. Nixon, acting personally and 
through his subordinates, for his own polit-
ical advantage, not for any legitimate gov-
ernmental purpose and without due consider-
ation for the national good.’’ 55 
In the current Impeachment of President 
Trump, the Judiciary Committee has defined 
abuse of power as occurring ‘‘when a Presi-
dent exercises the powers of his office to ob-
tain an improper personal benefit while in-
juring and ignoring the national interest.’’ 56 
From these sources, I have concluded that 
an abuse of power by a sitting President has 
the following three elements: 
1) The use of official governmental power; 
2) For personal or some other corrupt pur-
pose; 
3) Without due consideration for the na-
tional interest. 
President Trump’s conduct in soliciting 
foreign interference in the 2020 presidential 
election meets each of these elements of the 
charge of abuse of power. Moreover, the de-
fenses put forth by the President’s Counsel 
are substantively deficient when viewed in 
the context of the corrupt scheme conducted 
by President Trump through his personal at-
torney, Rudy Giuliani, starting in late 2018. 
B. The Corrupt Scheme 
President Trump engaged in a corrupt 
scheme to solicit foreign interference in the 
2020 presidential election to tarnish his polit-
ical rivals and bolster public perceptions of 
the legitimacy of his 2016 electoral victory. 
The corrupt scheme served to benefit the 
President in a personal, political manner, 
and was contrary to the national interest. 
President Trump repeatedly misused the 
powers of the presidency to increase pressure 
on Ukraine to further the corrupt scheme, 
including withholding a White House meet-
ing and U.S. military assistance that the 
Ukrainians desperately need to counter Rus-
sia. This scheme continued even after a whis-
tleblower exposed the President’s efforts and 
even following the launch of the Impeach-
ment inquiry by the House. 
The scheme directed by the President com-
prised two separate efforts—both aimed to 
damage his political rivals and benefit his 
reelection prospects. The first effort was to 
get the Ukrainian government to announce 
an investigation into baseless accusations 
propagated by a Russian disinformation 
campaign,57 that Ukraine interfered in the 
2016 election to benefit President Trump’s 
political rival, Hillary Clinton (hereinafter 
referred to as the ‘‘2016 campaign theory’’). 
The 2016 campaign theory comprised numer-
ous unfounded allegations including that 
Ukraine colluded with the Democrats to in-
fluence the 2016 election and that the cyber-
security company Crowdstrike, falsely al-
leged to be owned by a Ukrainian oligarch, 
investigated the hack of the Democratic Na-
tional Committee (DNC) computer infra-
structure, 
and 
covered 
up 
evidence 
of 
Ukrainian culpability in the cyber-attack by 
hiding the servers from the FBI inside 
Ukraine.58 
President Trump’s fixation on the 2016 
campaign theory appears to have been in-
tended to change public perceptions of Presi-
dent Trump’s connection to Russia, in the 
wake of the Intelligence Community assess-
ment that Russia interfered in the 2016 elec-
tion to support then candidate Trump,59 and 
the Special Counsel’s mandate including to 
review ‘‘any links or coordination between 
the Russian government and individuals as-
sociated with the Trump campaign.’’ 60 The 
Special Counsel noted ‘‘several [of President 
Trump’s] advisors recalled that the Presi-
dent . . . viewed stories about his Russian 
connections, the Russian investigations and 
the Intelligence Community assessment of 
Russian interference as a threat to the legit-
imacy of his electoral victory.’’ 61 Further, in 
the spring of 2019, the Special Counsel af-
firmed the assessments of the Intelligence 
Community and concluded that while there 
was no direct conspiracy or coordination be-
tween the Kremlin and the Trump campaign, 
‘‘. . . the Russian government perceived it 
would benefit from a Trump presidency and 
worked to secure that outcome, and that the 
campaign 
expected 
it 
would 
benefit 
electorally from information stolen and re-
leased through Russian efforts . . .’’ 62 In di-
recting this effort of the scheme, the Presi-
dent was attempting to rewrite history by 
having a foreign power make statements to 
validate his allegations that it was Ukraine 
colluding with the Democrats rather than 
Russia interfering to benefit then candidate 
Trump and exonerate himself of any wrong-
doing or ties to Russia. 
In addition, the 2016 campaign theory 
sought to implicate the President’s political 
rival in 2016, former Secretary of State Hil-
lary Clinton. As Deputy Assistant Secretary 
George Kent testified, the President ‘‘wanted 
nothing less than President [Zelensky] to go 
to [a] microphone and say investigations, 
Biden, and Clinton.’’ He confirmed that 
‘‘shorthand’’ for Clinton ‘‘was 2016.’’ 63 
The scheme also comprised a second effort 
to get the Ukrainian government to an-
nounce an investigation into unfounded cor-
ruption allegations against former Vice 
President Joe Biden and his son Hunter 
Biden (hereinafter referred to as ‘‘Biden/ 
Burisma theory’’). The allegations associ-
ated with this theory surround Vice Presi-
dent Biden’s successful pressuring of Ukrain-
ian President Poroshenko to remove Ukrain-
ian Prosecutor General Victor Shokin in 
2016, who purportedly was investigating a 
Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, on 
whose board Hunter Biden served.64
Vice 
President Biden is a potential presidential 
challenger to President Trump in the 2020 
Presidential election and was viewed as a 
frontrunner during the spring and summer of 
2019 when President Trump directed such ef-
forts to further the scheme. The President 
needed to undercut Vice President Biden as a 
candidate to enhance his chances of reelec-
tion.65 
Successfully pressuring the Ukrainian gov-
ernment to announce investigations into the 
2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma theories 
was likely to garner the President several 
political benefits including help with his re-
election efforts. As the House Impeachment 
Managers state in their trial memo: 
Although these theories were groundless, 
President Trump sought a public announce-
ment by Ukraine of investigations into them 
[2016/the Bidens] in order to help his 2020 re-
election campaign. An announcement of a 
Ukrainian investigation into one of his key 
political rivals would be enormously valu-
able to President Trump in his efforts to win 
reelection in 2020—just as the FBI’s inves-
tigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails had 
helped him in 2016. And an investigation sug-
gesting that President Trump did not benefit 
from Russian interference in the 2016 elec-
tion would give him a basis to assert—false-
ly—that he was the victim, rather than the 
beneficiary, of foreign meddling in the last 
election. Ukraine’s announcement of that in-
vestigation would bolster the perceived le-
gitimacy of his Presidency and, therefore, 
his political standing going into the 2020 
race.66 
President Trump needed to obfuscate what 
was known and proven about Russian in-
volvement on his behalf in the 2016 election 
to bolster the credibility of claims of 
Ukrainian Government involvement in the 
2016 election and corruption allegations 
against Vice President Biden ahead of the 
2020 election. By soliciting investigations 
into the 2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma 
theories, he sought to accomplish both of 
those goals. 
Throughout this scheme, which began in 
late 2018, President Trump employed Mr. 
Giuliani as his principal agent,67 and enlisted 
several U.S. government officials to assist 
with efforts to compel Ukrainian officials to 
launch investigations into these baseless 
theories. 
Mr. Giuliani involved associates in this 
scheme, including Lev Parnas and Igor 
Fruman, both of whom have been indicted in 
the Southern District of New York for con-
spiracy to violate election laws.68 Mr. Parnas 
and Mr. Fruman leveraged their Ukrainian 
connections to facilitate contacts between 
Mr. Giuliani and then Ukrainian Prosecutor 
General Yuriy Lutsenko and his predecessor 
Victor Shokin to advance the scheme. Both 
Mr. Lutsenko69 and Mr. Shokin70 were re-
moved from their positions under a cloud of 
corruption. 
The corrupt Ukrainian Prosecutors Gen-
eral Lutsenko and Shokin were among Mr. 
Giuliani’s sources for the unfounded allega-
tions in support of the 2016 campaign and 
Biden/Burisma theories. During a January 
2019 call via Skype,71 Mr. Shokin asserted he 
had 
overseen 
the 
investigation 
into 
Burisma.72
Mr. Shokin alleged that Vice 
President Biden forced his resignation to 
stop further investigation into Burisma and 
cover up wrongdoing.73 He made additional 
allegations including that he had wanted to 
come to the United States to share informa-
tion regarding corruption at the Embassy, 
and that U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie 
Yovanovitch denied him a U.S. visa because 
she was close to Vice President Biden.74 Mr. 
Shokin later provided an affidavit espousing 
allegations against Vice President Biden, 
which explicitly stated that his sworn state-
ment was made at the behest of a pro-Putin 
Ukrainian oligarch.75 
Also, in January 2019, Mr. Giuliani met in 
New York with Yuriy Lutsenko, who was 
then the Ukrainian Prosecutor General. Dur-
ing these initial conversations with Mr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1188 
February 27, 2020 
Giuliani, Mr. Lutsenko made multiple alle-
gations that Ukrainian government officials 
interfered in the 2016 election to help Demo-
cratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He also 
made allegations about corrupt practices at 
Burisma and raised the possibility that there 
could have been improper payments to Hun-
ter Biden. In addition, Mr. Lutsenko made 
false allegations against U.S. Ambassador to 
Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.’’ 76 
Using these unfounded allegations, Mr. 
Giuliani launched a disinformation cam-
paign on traditional and social media. In the 
spring of 2019, Mr. Giuliani and his associates 
worked with columnist John Solomon, who 
wrote a series of articles in The Hill, ampli-
fying the false allegations of Mr. Lutsenko 
and Mr. Shokin.77 Through these columns 
and a related interview, Mr. Lutsenko an-
nounced he was opening investigations into 
aspects of both the 2016 campaign and Biden/ 
Burisma theories.78 The President,79 his son 
Donald Trump Jr.,80 and Mr. Giuliani 81 am-
plified the false allegations by retweeting 
the articles. President Trump 82
and Mr. 
Giuliani 83 also repeated the false allegations 
contained in The Hill articles during press 
interviews. 
In furtherance of the corrupt scheme, 
President Trump directed the removal of 
Ambassador Yovanovitch. As laid out in the 
Statement of Material Facts by the House 
Impeachment Managers, ‘‘the removal of 
Ambassador Yovanovitch was the culmina-
tion of a months-long smear campaign waged 
by the President’s personal lawyer, Rudy 
Giuliani, and other allies of the President. 
The President also helped amplify the smear 
campaign.’’ 84 Ambassador Yovanovitch testi-
fied she was told her removal from post was 
not for cause.85 Mr. Giuliani later admitted 
he ‘‘believed that [he] needed Ambassador 
Yovanovitch out of the way’’ because ‘‘[s]he 
was going to make the investigations dif-
ficult for everybody.’’ 86 Documents obtained 
by the House Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence further confirm that the Am-
bassador’s firing was part of the effort to fur-
ther the corrupt scheme. A text message 
from 
Ukrainian 
Prosecutor 
General 
Lutsenko warned Giuliani associate Lev 
Parnas that if they didn’t fire Ambassador 
Yovanovitch, ‘‘you are bringing into ques-
tion all my allegations including about 
‘‘B.’’ 87 Mr. Parnas confirmed in a press inter-
view that the ‘‘B’’ referred to Hunter Biden.88 
As previously discussed, both the 2016 cam-
paign and Biden/Burisma theories are un-
founded. The 2016 campaign theory is an ac-
tive Russian disinformation campaign.89 On 
December 9, 2019, FBI Director Christopher 
Wray stated, ‘‘We have no information that 
indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 
2016 presidential election.’’ 90 
Further, the President’s own national se-
curity officials have rejected the claim that 
the Ukrainian government systematically 
interfered in the 2016 election, including re-
futing the theory that Ukraine was behind 
the hack of the DNC servers.91 Trump Home-
land Security adviser Tom Bossert stressed, 
‘‘[t]he DNC server and that conspiracy the-
ory has got to go, they have to stop with 
that, it cannot continue to be repeated . . . 
in our discourse.’’ 92 
With regards to the Biden/Burisma theory, 
no proof of any wrongdoing has been made to 
support this claim.93 No evidence has been 
presented showing Vice President Biden spe-
cifically discussed Burisma with then Presi-
dent Poroshenko in relation to the removal 
of the corrupt Prosecutor General. Further-
more, U.S. diplomats, such as Former Spe-
cial Envoy to Ukraine Ambassador Kurt 
Volker defended Vice President Biden’s ac-
tions. In his closed interview with the House 
Committees, Volker stated, ‘‘There is clear 
evidence that Vice President Biden did in-
deed weigh in with the President of Ukraine 
to have Shokin fired but the motivations for 
that are entirely different from those con-
tained in that allegation.’’ 94 Vice President 
Biden, acting as the point person for Ukraine 
policy in the Obama Administration, was 
representing the interests of the United 
States and the international community,95 
promoting increased transparency, corrup-
tion reform, and the rule of law.96 Vice Presi-
dent Biden’s public statements from the 
time reflect such efforts, focusing on com-
batting corruption and institutional reform 
rather than specific companies, such as 
Burisma.97 
The President’s Counsel made misleading 
assertions that U.S. Government officials 
warned the Vice President of the appearance 
of wrongdoing in an attempt to convince him 
to take corrective action. One person they 
cited was Amos Hochstein, a diplomat who 
served in the Obama Administration.98 Mr. 
Hochstein did raise the matter with the Vice 
President but did not recommend that Hun-
ter Biden resign from the board of Burisma.99 
By mid-May 2019, Mr. Lutsenko publicly 
recanted previous allegations he made to Mr. 
Giuliani, including admitting that he had no 
evidence of wrongdoing by Vice President 
Biden 
or 
Hunter 
Biden.100
Ambassador 
Volker explained Mr. Lutsenko’s motiva-
tions for making these baseless accusations, 
‘‘My opinion of Prosecutor General Lutsenko 
was that he was acting in a self-serving man-
ner, frankly making things up, in order to 
appear important to the United States, be-
cause he wanted to save his job.’’ 101 
At no point during the trial did the Presi-
dent’s Counsel dispute the facts surrounding 
the scheme. The record is clear that the 
President directed the corrupt scheme to so-
licit investigations into the 2016 campaign 
and Biden/Burisma theories for his personal 
political gain. 
C. President Trump’s Misuse of his Office to Ad-
vance the Corrupt Scheme 
President Trump used the powers of his of-
fice to advance the corrupt scheme through 
multiple efforts, violating the public trust 
and placing his own personal political inter-
ests above the interests of the nation. In 
doing so, the President abused the power of 
his office. 
C.1. President Trump Solicited Ukrainian Presi-
dent Zelensky to Open Investigations into 
the 2016 Campaign and Biden/Burisma 
Theories 
President Trump abused the powers of his 
office in order to advance the corrupt 
scheme by attempting to leverage the 
Ukrainian desire for an Oval Office meeting 
and U.S. security assistance as a quid pro 
quo for Ukrainian investigations into his po-
litical opponents that would benefit his re-
election in 2020. Starting in May 2019, Presi-
dent Trump directed a sustained campaign 
to solicit newly-elected Ukrainian President 
Zelensky to undertake investigations into 
the 2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma theo-
ries. 
C.1.a. President Trump conditioned an Oval Of-
fice meeting on investigations into the 2016 
campaign and Biden/Burisma theories 
President Trump’s misuse of his official 
powers, with regard to this matter, began 
shortly after Volodymyr Zelensky won the 
Ukrainian presidential election on April 21, 
2019. In early May, Mr. Giuliani announced 
that he planned to travel to Ukraine to meet 
with President-elect Zelensky ‘‘to urge him 
to pursue inquiries’’ into ‘‘the origin of the 
Special Counsel’s investigation into Russia’s 
interference in the 2016 election’’ and Hunter 
Biden’s ‘‘involvement’’ in Burisma.102
Mr. 
Giuliani admitted that he was not con-
ducting ‘‘foreign policy’’ but rather ‘‘med-
dling in an investigation,’’ 103 and that Presi-
dent Trump was aware of his activities.104 
In trying to arrange a meeting with Presi-
dent Zelensky, Mr. Giuliani was acting in a 
private capacity, not as a public official or 
to advance official U.S. policy. On May 10, 
2019, Mr. Giuliani wrote to then President- 
Elect Zelensky, to request a meeting in his 
capacity as ‘‘personal counsel to President 
Trump and with his knowledge and con-
sent.’’ 105 Mr. Giuliani made clear in the let-
ter he was representing Donald Trump as a 
private citizen, not as President of the 
United States. While the letter did not state 
the purpose of the requested meeting, Mr. 
Giuliani stated publicly on the same day 
that he intended to tell President Zelensky 
to pursue investigations into the 2016 cam-
paign and Biden/Burisma theories.106 Then on 
May 11th, Mr. Giuliani abruptly cancelled 
his trip to Ukraine, declaring that President- 
Elect Zelensky had surrounded himself with 
‘‘enemies of the President’’ (referring to 
President Trump).107 
President 
Trump 
intertwined 
Mr. 
Giuliani’s private mission and the activities 
of public officials when he directed U.S. offi-
cials to aid his personal attorney in advanc-
ing this scheme. At a May 23rd meeting in 
the Oval Office, President Trump was briefed 
by Ambassador Paul Volker, Ambassador 
Gordon Sondland, and Secretary of Energy 
Rick Perry, who would subsequently describe 
themselves as the ‘‘Three Amigos,’’ (herein-
after referred to as the ‘‘Three Amigos’’) on 
their recent trip to attend the inauguration 
of President Zelensky.108 Witness testimony 
indicates that despite their positive assess-
ments about President Zelensky, President 
Trump was unconvinced, and replied that the 
Ukrainians tried to ‘‘take me down’’ in 2016, 
referring to the debunked 2016 campaign the-
ory.109
The 
President 
resisted 
the 
rec-
ommendation of the Three Amigos to invite 
President Zelensky to the White House, and 
instead repeatedly directed these three offi-
cials to ‘‘talk to Rudy.’’ 110
Ambassador 
Sondland testified that he understood this to 
refer to Mr. Giuliani and that ‘‘if we did not 
talk to Rudy, nothing would move forward 
on Ukraine.’’ 111 Ambassador Sondland fur-
ther explained that they chose to follow the 
President’s direction to communicate with 
Mr. Giuliani, not because they liked it, but 
because ‘‘it was the only constructive path 
open to us.’’ 112 
The Three Amigos frequently operated out-
side regular diplomatic channels between the 
United States and Ukraine, but their activi-
ties were not a secret to the President’s na-
tional security officials. Ambassador Bill 
Taylor, Charge d’affaires at the U.S. Em-
bassy in Kyiv, described in his testimony 
how, while he operated in the regular chan-
nel of U.S. policymaking regarding Ukraine, 
beginning on May 23rd there emerged ‘‘an ir-
regular, informal channel,’’ consisting of 
Special 
Envoy 
Volker, 
Ambassador 
Sondland, 
Secretary 
Perry, 
and 
Mr. 
Giuliani.113 As Ambassador Sondland testi-
fied, ‘‘everyone was in the loop,’’ 114 further 
clarifying that President Trump, Secretary 
Pompeo, Mr. Giuliani, and Acting Chief of 
Staff Mick Mulvaney were kept informed of 
the activities undertaken by the Three Ami-
gos. Fiona Hill, National Security Council 
Director for European and Russian Affairs, 
concluded that Ambassador Sondland was 
correct that he was keeping the relevant of-
ficials informed of his activities because he 
was ‘‘involved in a domestic political er-
rand’’ while she and other government offi-
cials were conducting U.S. national security 
foreign policy, and ‘‘those two things had 
just diverged.’’ 115 
The purpose of these two channels diverged 
as well: while the career diplomats were en-
gaged in promoting U.S. national security

February 27, 2020 
interests in supporting Ukraine in its fight 
against Russian aggression, the irregular 
channel was engaged in pursuing a quid pro 
quo to secure Ukrainian investigations into 
the 2016 campaign and the Biden/Burisma 
theories for the benefit of the President’s 
2020 reelection. At the direction of the Presi-
dent, as conveyed through Mr. Giuliani and 
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick 
Mulvaney, the Three Amigos pursued a quid 
pro quo—the offer of a politically valuable 
Oval Office meeting with President Trump in 
exchange for President Zelensky announcing 
the 
desired 
investigations. 
Ambassador 
Sondland testified ‘‘Mr. Giuliani’s requests 
were a quid pro quo for arranging a White 
House visit for President Zelensky.’’ 116 
The evidence shows that by early July, the 
message was conveyed to Ukrainian officials 
that investigations were a prerequisite for 
their desired White House meeting. Ambas-
sador Volker testified that when the Oval Of-
fice meeting was not scheduled by late June, 
he ‘‘came to believe that the President’s 
long-held negative view toward Ukraine was 
causing hesitation in actually scheduling the 
meeting.’’ 117 At a bilateral meeting in To-
ronto in early July, Ambassador Volker tes-
tified 
that 
he 
told 
alerted 
President 
Zelensky that he couldn’t get a date sched-
uled for the White House meeting. Ambas-
sador Volker relayed to President Zelensky, 
‘‘I think we have a problem here, and that 
problem being the negative feed of informa-
tion from Mr. Giuliani.’’ 118
Ambassador 
Volker further testified that during the To-
ronto meeting, he specifically mentioned in-
vestigations 
into 
‘‘2016’’ 
election 
and 
‘‘Burisma’’ with President Zelensky.119 Soon 
after this warning, President Zelensky’s 
close aide Andriy Yermak asked to be con-
nected with Mr. Giuliani.120 
The President’s conditions for securing a 
White House meeting were communicated an 
additional time, during a July 10, 2019, bilat-
eral meeting led by then National Security 
Adviser John Bolton and then Ukrainian Na-
tional 
Security 
Adviser 
Oleksandr 
Danylyuk. During the meeting, the Ukrain-
ian delegation raised their desire to have a 
White House meeting.121 NSC official Hill 
testified that Ambassador Sondland, who 
was in attendance at the meeting, responded 
to the Ukrainian request by stating, ‘‘We 
have an agreement that there will be a meet-
ing, if specific investigations are put under 
way.’’ 122 NSC official Lt. Col. Vindman testi-
fied that during that afternoon’s meetings 
with the Ukrainian delegation, Ambassador 
Sondland ‘‘emphasized the importance of 
Ukraine delivering the investigations into 
2016 elections, the Bidens and Burisma.’’ 123 
Later, Ambassador Sondland told Dr. Hill 
that 
there 
was 
agreement 
with 
Mr. 
Mulvaney that there would be a White House 
meeting with President Zelensky ‘‘in return 
for investigations.’’ 124 According to Dr. Hill, 
Ambassador Bolton was so alarmed that he 
told her to inform the lawyers about what 
happened in the meeting, adding that he was 
not be part of ‘‘whatever drug deal that 
Mulvaney and Sondland are cooking up.’’ 125 
C.1.b. President Trump withheld military 
assistance 
President Trump also used the powers of 
his office to order, through the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), the with-
holding of congressionally appropriated se-
curity assistance to Ukraine. The evidence 
shows that the President fixated on a June 
19, 2019 article in the Washington Examiner 
announcing the release of Ukraine security 
assistance as an additional leverage point to 
further the corrupt scheme.126 By no later 
than July 12, 2019,127 President Trump or-
dered a hold on $391 million in security as-
sistance for Ukraine, consisting of $250 mil-
lion in Department of Defense Ukraine Secu-
rity Assistance Initiative (USAI) funding and 
$141 million in State Department Foreign 
Military Financing (FMF). At an inter-
agency meeting on July 18, 2019, a week be-
fore the Trump-Zelensky phone call, OMB of-
ficials instructed relevant U.S. government 
departments and agencies to withhold obli-
gation of the Ukraine security assistance at 
the direction of the President.128 According 
to multiple witnesses, OMB did not provide a 
reason for the President’s hold on the 
Ukraine aid.129 OMB maintained this hold on 
Ukraine security assistance through Sep-
tember 11th, when OMB lifted the hold, again 
without providing a rationale for the change 
of course.130 
The President’s Counsel claim that the 
President’s hold on security assistance was 
because of a policy difference, but that claim 
is not supported by the evidence. The man-
ner in which the White House placed the hold 
on security assistance for Ukraine differed 
significantly from the process in which holds 
of assistance to other countries based on pol-
icy considerations had previously occurred. 
As the House Impeachment Managers stated, 
‘‘What the President did is not the same as 
routine withholding of foreign aid to ensure 
that it aligns with the President’s policy pri-
orities or to adjust with geopolitical devel-
opments.’’ 131
The President began asking 
about the hold based on the announcement 
of the release of funds, after the Department 
of Defense had certified that the Ukrainian 
government made progress on corruption re-
form, showing that the hold was not placed 
due to policy considerations. Further, no 
geopolitical circumstances had changed in 
that timeframe to warrant the placing of a 
hold on security assistance funds to Ukraine. 
In addition, despite substantial evidence 
that U.S. government officials were deeply 
concerned about conflicts with the Impound-
ment Control Act (ICA), there was no notifi-
cation of the delay to Congress as required 
by this law, belying the idea that the Presi-
dent harbored legitimate concerns about pol-
icy.132 Congress has an established bipartisan 
record of robust support for Ukraine. Since 
2014, the United States has provided more 
than $3.5 billion in foreign assistance to 
Ukraine: $1.96 billion in military and other 
security assistance and $1.6 billion in polit-
ical aid to Ukraine, all illustrating a policy 
that support to Ukraine furthers U.S. na-
tional security interests.133 Interagency con-
versations while the hold was in place re-
flected concerns that withholding the funds 
would in fact violate the ICA,134 yet there 
were no plans to notify Congress or rescind 
the funds as required by under the ICA. Fur-
ther, when OMB official Mike Duffey di-
rected 
Acting 
DOD 
Comptroller 
Elaine 
McCusker to formally hold the assistance for 
Ukraine, he added, ‘‘Given the sensitive na-
ture of the request, I appreciate your keep-
ing that information closely held to those 
who need to know to execute the direc-
tion.’’ 135 The secrecy maintained by Admin-
istration officials regarding the hold on this 
security assistance differs significantly from 
past practice and supports the inference that 
they were aware that the hold was contrary 
to U.S. policy and that they had no legiti-
mate policy justification for a change in U.S. 
policy. 
In withholding the security assistance for 
Ukraine, the President violated his duty to 
faithfully execute the laws. Congress enacted 
the ICA in 1974 as one of many responses to 
the abuses of President Nixon in order to re-
quire the President to obligate funds appro-
priated by Congress, unless Congress other-
wise authorizes the withholding.136 The ICA 
provides the President with narrowly cir-
cumscribed authority to withhold, or ‘‘im-
pound,’’ appropriated funds only in limited, 
specified circumstances, and included a re-
quirement to inform Congress. At no point 
did the Trump Administration either assert 
that it was impounding the Ukraine security 
assistance or inform Congress of any deferral 
or rescission of funds. In reviewing the 
OMB’s withholding of funds appropriated to 
the Department of Defense for Ukraine secu-
rity assistance, the Government Account-
ability Office concluded that OMB violated 
the ICA.137 
C.1.c. President Trump conditioned a White 
House meeting and Ukrainian security assist-
ance on investigations 
The House Impeachment Managers’ record 
demonstrates overwhelmingly that President 
Trump conditioned both a White House 
meeting and nearly $400 million in U.S. secu-
rity assistance for Ukraine on a commitment 
by President Zelensky to conduct investiga-
tions for the personal political benefit of 
Donald Trump. The President’s scheme to se-
cure corrupt investigations to benefit his re-
election efforts converged with his official 
duties during a July 25, 2019, phone call with 
President Zelensky. The President’s actions 
during that phone call, understood in the 
context of the broader corrupt scheme, are 
compelling evidence that the President solic-
ited foreign interference in U.S. elections. 
The President’s own words during the July 
25th call, as summarized in a memorandum 
of telephone conversation released by the 
White House, demonstrate the President’s 
demand for a quid pro quo.138 Far from show-
ing the ‘‘perfect call’’ that President Trump 
claims,139 the memorandum of the telephone 
conversation makes clear that the President 
solicited 
politically-motivated 
investiga-
tions from President Zelensky in exchange 
for a White House meeting and U.S. military 
aid. When the Ukrainian President indicated 
he would be seeking additional U.S. military 
arms that Ukraine desperately needed for its 
conflict with Russia, President Trump re-
sponded 
by 
requesting 
that 
President 
Zelensky do him ‘‘a favor though.’’ 140 The 
memorandum of the telephone conversation 
makes clear that the favor President Trump 
sought as a condition for future military aid 
was the two investigations into the 2016 cam-
paign and the Biden/Burisma theories. Presi-
dent Trump went on to espouse many of the 
allegations associated with the debunked 
2016 
campaign 
theory, 
including 
‘‘Crowdstrike,’’ and ‘‘one of your wealthy 
people,’’ falsely insinuating that a Ukrainian 
oligarch owned the cybersecurity firm that 
investigated the DNC hack.141 He then al-
leged that Ukraine has the server and added, 
‘‘. . . They say a lot of it started in Ukraine. 
Whatever you can do, it’s very important 
that you do it. . .’’ 142 Later in the phone 
call, President Trump mentioned ‘‘the other 
thing’’ he wanted investigated, declaring 
that there was ‘‘a lot of talk about’’ Vice 
President ‘‘Biden’s son,’’ and that Vice 
President 
‘‘Biden 
stopped 
the 
prosecu-
tion.’’ 143
President Trump told President 
Zelensky, ‘‘A lot of people want to find out 
about that, so whatever you can do with the 
Attorney General would be great.’’ 144 In ad-
dition, it must be noted President Trump 
specifically urged President Zelensky to call 
Mr. Giuliani, as well as Attorney General 
Barr,145
regarding investigations into the 
2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma theories.146 
Given all of the steps taken by Mr. Giuliani 
leading up to the call, including his letter to 
President Zelensky and public statements 
urging President Zelensky to undertake in-

February 27, 2020 
of an arrangement and he felt no pressure 
during the July 25th phone call. However, 
evidence shows that the President’s surro-
gates prepped President Zelensky ahead of 
the call to say that he would conduct inves-
tigations into the 2016 campaign and Biden/ 
Burisma theories in order to get a White 
House meeting. Ambassadors Volker and 
Sondland had multiple exchanges with Presi-
dent Zelensky and his aide Mr. Yermak 
ahead of the call. Ambassador Volker, after 
having breakfast with Mr. Giuliani, told Am-
bassador Taylor and Ambassador Sondland 
via text, ‘‘Most important is for Zelensky to 
say that he will help with investigation.’’ 147 
That same day, Ambassador Sondland di-
rected President Zelensky to tell President 
Trump, he would ‘‘run a fully transparent in-
vestigation and turn over every stone,’’ 148 
which he indicated in testimony referred to 
the ‘‘Burisma and the 2016’’ investigations.149 
The morning of the July 25th call, Ambas-
sador Sondland spoke to President Trump 
and then alerted Ambassador Volker to con-
tact him.150 Approximately a half hour later, 
Ambassador Volker texted Zelensky aide Mr. 
Yermak, ‘‘Heard from White House—assum-
ing President Z[elensky] convinces Trump he 
will investigate/ ‘get to the bottom of what 
happened’ in 2016, we will nail down a date 
for a visit in Washington.’’ 151 
The memorandum of the telephone con-
versation shows that President Zelensky un-
derstood the messages that he was told to 
convey during the call and followed those in-
structions. 
During 
the 
call, 
President 
Zelensky said to President Trump, ‘‘I also 
wanted to thank you for your invitation to 
visit the United States, specifically Wash-
ington D.C. On the other hand, I also want to 
ensure you that we will be very serious 
about the case and will work on the inves-
tigation.’’ 152 Lt. Col. Vindman testified that 
aspects of the call, including President 
Zelensky bringing up Burisma, suggested 
that he was ‘‘prepped’’ for this call.153 Presi-
dent Zelensky knew what ‘‘favor’’ President 
Trump was asking for as a condition for re-
ceiving the White House meeting. 
C.1.d. The actions of Administration officials 
following the July 25th phone call dem-
onstrate that the President conditioned U.S. 
military aid to Ukraine and the White House 
meeting on President Zelensky announcing 
the investigations into the 2016 campaign and 
Biden/Burisma theories 
The President’s Counsel allege that there 
is no evidence that the President conditioned 
U.S. military aid for Ukraine or the White 
House meeting on a commitment by Presi-
dent Zelensky to announce investigations 
into the 2016 campaign and Biden/Burisma 
theories. The President’s Counsel assert that 
any claims that President Trump made any 
such linkage, particularly relating to the 
military assistance, are unsupported and 
based on second or third-hand sources and 
speculation. They claim that no one with 
first-hand knowledge of the President’s 
thinking came forward and testified that he 
conditioned the delivery of these official acts 
for Ukraine on the investigations. These 
claims are both disingenuous and wrong.154 
Furthermore, the actions of Administra-
tion officials after the July 25th phone call 
make clear President Trump’s request was a 
quid pro quo. Approximately 90 minutes 
after the call, OMB official Mike Duffey di-
rected Acting DoD Comptroller McCusker to 
formally hold the Department of Defense se-
curity assistance for Ukraine.155 
In addition, conversations on July 26, 2019, 
detail that President Trump appeared solely 
focused on whether efforts to pressure Presi-
dent Zelensky to initiate the investigations 
had been successful. On July 26th, the day 
after the phone call between Presidents 
Trump and Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland 
called President Trump from Kyiv. Accord-
ing to testimony from David Holmes, Coun-
selor for Political Affairs at the U.S. Em-
bassy who overheard the phone call, Presi-
dent Trump asked Ambassador Sondland, 
‘‘So he’s going to do the investigation?’’ re-
ferring to the 2016 campaign and Burisma/ 
Biden theories.156 Holmes also testified that 
he asked Ambassador Sondland that same 
day if President Trump cared about Ukraine. 
Sondland responded that President ‘‘Trump 
only cared about ‘big stuff’ that benefits the 
President, like the ‘Biden investigation’ that 
Mr. Giuliani was pushing.’’ 157 
Most telling, President Trump’s Acting 
Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney publicly ad-
mitted at a press conference on October 17th 
that withholding the security assistance for 
Ukraine 
provided 
leverage 
to 
convince 
Ukraine to investigate the source of the 
hack of the DNC servers in 2016, an aspect of 
the 2016 campaign theory.158 Mr. Mulvaney 
confirmed 
that 
President 
Trump 
‘‘[a]bsolutely’’ raised ‘‘corruption related to 
the DNC server’’ and added that was part of 
‘‘why we held up the money.’’ 159 When a re-
porter pointed out that he had just described 
a quid pro quo, Mr. Mulvaney stated, ‘‘We do 
that all the time with foreign policy’’ and 
told everyone to ‘‘Get over it. There’s going 
to be political influence in foreign pol-
icy.’’ 160 
Despite the assertions of the President’s 
counsel, 
evidence 
indicates 
that 
the 
Zelensky Administration knew that there 
was a problem with the security assistance 
well before the hold was reported publicly on 
August 28, 2019.161 The same afternoon of the 
July 25th phone call, Department of Defense 
officials learned that diplomats at the 
Ukrainian Embassy in Washington had made 
multiple overtures to the Pentagon and the 
State Department ‘‘asking about security as-
sistance.’’ 162 Separately, during that same 
time frame, two different officials at the 
Ukrainian Embassy contacted Ambassador 
Volker’s special assistant, Catherine Croft, 
to ask her in confidence about the hold.163 In 
early August 2019, the Ukrainians reportedly 
made further inquiries about the security as-
sistance funds.164 The message sent back was 
that the holdup was not bureaucratic in na-
ture, and that to address it they were ad-
vised to reach out to Mick Mulvaney.165 NSC 
official Lt. Col. Vindman testified that by 
mid-August 2019, he had also received inquir-
ies about the hold on the security assistance 
from an official at the Ukrainian Embassy.166 
Evidence 
and 
reporting 
regarding 
the 
President’s interactions with then National 
Security Adviser John Bolton further con-
firms that the President held security assist-
ance in order to further the corrupt scheme. 
On August 16, 2019, Ambassador Bolton re-
portedly made a personal appeal to President 
Trump to release the security assistance for 
Ukraine and was ‘‘rebuffed.’’ 167 NSC official 
Tim Morrison affirmed this account in his 
testimony. Mr. Morrison testified that Am-
bassador 
Bolton 
said 
President 
Trump, 
‘‘wasn’t ready’’ to release the aid.168 Accord-
ing to news reports that emerged during the 
Impeachment trial, an account from Ambas-
sador Bolton’s forthcoming book reportedly 
makes this link even more explicit. 
Ambassador Bolton stated during the Au-
gust meeting, President Trump ‘‘appeared fo-
cused on the theories Mr. Giuliani had 
shared with him, replying to Mr. Bolton’s 
question that he preferred sending no assist-
ance to Ukraine until officials turned over 
all materials they had about the Russia in-
vestigation that related to Mr. Biden and 
supporters of Mrs. Clinton in Ukraine.’’ 169 
The record also shows that after the July 
25th Trump-Zelensky phone call, President 
Trump directed a campaign to increase the 
pressure in furtherance of the scheme. Start-
ing in early August, Ambassadors Volker 
and Sondland, in coordination with Mr. 
Giuliani, 
attempted 
to 
get 
President 
Zelensky to publicly announce investiga-
tions into the 2016 campaign and Biden/ 
Burisma theories.170
Ambassadors Volker 
and Sondland worked in conjunction with 
President Zelensky’s aide Mr. Yermak to 
generate an acceptable statement.171 After 
the initial Ukrainian draft of the statement 
contained only a general commitment from 
President Zelensky to fight corruption, Am-
bassadors Volker and Sondland consulted 
Mr. Giuliani who responded that if the state-
ment ‘‘doesn’t say Burisma and 2016, it’s not 
credible.’’ 172
Ambassador Volker then re-
vised President Zelensky’s draft statement 
to include specific references to ‘‘Burisma’’ 
and ‘‘the 2016 U.S. elections.’’ 173 No state-
ment 
was 
ever 
released 
by 
President 
Zelensky, and Ambassador Volker testified 
that it was because the Ukrainians realized 
that making such a statement was tanta-
mount to a quid pro quo.174 
Furthermore, witness testimony shows 
that as the hold on the security assistance 
continued through the late summer, U.S. 
government officials realized the connection 
between the hold and the President’s desire 
for Ukrainian announcements of investiga-
tions into President Trump’s political rivals. 
By early September, Ambassador Taylor said 
his ‘‘clear understanding’’ was that Presi-
dent Trump would withhold security assist-
ance until President Zelensky ‘‘committed 
to pursue the investigations.’’ 175 Ambassador 
Taylor further testified that his contempora-
neous notes reflect that President Trump 
wanted President Zelensky ‘‘in a box by 
making [a] public statement about ordering 
such 
investigations.’’ 176
Ambassador 
Sondland explained to Ambassador Taylor 
that ‘‘everything’’ (the Oval Office meeting 
and security assistance) ‘‘was dependent on 
the Ukrainian government announcing the 
political 
investigations.’’ 177
Ambassador 
Taylor responded to Ambassador Sondland 
that he thought it was ‘‘crazy to withhold se-
curity assistance for help with a political 
campaign.’’ 178 Foreign Service Officer David 
Holmes testified that his ‘‘clear impression’’ 
around the same time was that ‘‘the security 
assistance hold was likely intended by the 
President either to express dissatisfaction 
with the Ukrainians who had not yet agreed 
to the Burisma/Biden investigations, or as an 
effort to increase the pressure on them to do 
so.’’ 179 
Once the hold on the security assistance 
was reported in the press in late August 2019, 
the conditions for releasing the assistance 
were soon overtly communicated to Presi-
dent Zelensky. President Trump’s surrogates 
informed President Zelensky and his aides 
that the security assistance was held up as a 
result of President Zelensky’s unwillingness 
to announce the investigations into Presi-
dent Trump’s political rivals. These direc-
tions came from the President.180 Ambas-
sador Sondland testified that he had passed a 
message directly to President Zelensky’s 
aide Mr. Yermak on September 1, 2019, that, 
‘‘I believed that the resumption of U.S. aid 
would not likely occur until Ukraine took 
some kind of action on the public statement 
that we had been discussing for weeks.’’ 181 
Affirming this account, Ambassador Taylor 
testified that Ambassador Sondland told him 
he had warned President Zelensky and Mr. 
Yermak that, ‘‘although this was not a quid 
pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear 
things up in public, we would be at a stale-
mate.’’ 182 President Zelensky apparently un-
derstood the message because arrangements 
were made for the Ukrainian President to go 
on CNN to announce the investigations.183 
The President’s Counsel argue that there 
could not have been a quid pro quo because

February 27, 2020 
the Ukrainians ultimately got the funding 
without making the commitment to conduct 
the investigations. Essentially, they argue 
‘‘no harm, no foul.’’ However, the President’s 
solicitation of the politically-motivated in-
vestigations in exchange for official acts is 
in and of itself an abuse of his office and the 
public trust. Further, President Trump re-
leased the hold on the security assistance 
only after a whistleblower’s complaint had 
been provided to Congress and three House 
committees had initiated an investigation 
into the hold. On August 12, 2019, a whistle-
blower filed a complaint with the Intel-
ligence 
Community’s 
Inspector 
General, 
which stated multiple U.S. government offi-
cials had told him or her information indi-
cating that the ‘‘President of the United 
States is using the power of his office to so-
licit interference from a foreign country in 
the 2020 U.S. election.’’ 184
The complaint 
cited the July 25th call between Presidents 
Trump and Zelensky, the placing of the call 
on 
a 
codeword 
server, 
and 
other 
cir-
cumstances surrounding the call including 
the role of Mr. Giuliani.185 The President was 
reportedly briefed by White House Counsel 
on the existence of a whistleblower com-
plaint in late August.186 On September 9, 
2019, the whistleblower complaint was re-
ferred to Congress.187 On the same day, the 
House Permanent Select Committee on In-
telligence, the House Committee on Over-
sight and Government Reform, and the 
House Committee on Foreign Affairs opened 
an inquiry into the circumstances sur-
rounding the hold.188 The President subse-
quently lifted the hold on September 11, 
2019.189 
Moreover, the corrupt scheme did not end 
even after the House Committees began the 
Impeachment Inquiry. Mr. Giuliani, at the 
direction of the President, has continued to 
travel to Ukraine to generate compromising 
material on President Trump’s political op-
ponents,190 raising the possibility of future 
attempts by President Trump to pressure 
foreign leaders to interfere in the 2020 elec-
tion. 
Consistent with the first element delin-
eated for abuse of power, the evidence clear-
ly shows that President Trump misused his 
office to advance a corrupt scheme. 
The fact that President Trump’s actions 
involve the misuse of the office of the presi-
dency distinguishes the current proceedings 
from the circumstances in the 1999 Clinton 
Impeachment trial. Based on the historical 
record, the constitutional standard I applied 
in the Clinton proceedings was that ‘‘private 
wrongdoing, without a significant adverse ef-
fect upon the nation, cannot constitute an 
impeachable offense.’’ 191 On that basis, I con-
cluded that ‘‘Citizens may well lack con-
fidence in the ability of President Clinton to 
be honest about his personal life, this is not 
however a threat to our government.’’ 192 The 
circumstances regarding President Trump 
can be distinguished both on the grounds 
that his actions involved the misuse of his 
public office, not private wrongdoing, and 
because the nature of President Trump’s 
abuse of power is an ongoing threat to our 
systems of government and our constitu-
tional order. 
D. The President’s Solicitation of Investiga-
tions by Ukraine into the 2016 Campaign 
and Biden/Burisma Theories Was for his 
Personal or Other Corrupt Purpose 
The second element of the offense of abuse 
of power, as previously delineated, is the use 
of official governmental power for personal 
or some other corrupt purpose. The Presi-
dent’s Counsel have argued that the Presi-
dent had legitimate policy reasons for with-
holding the Ukraine security assistance or 
the White House meeting. Specifically, the 
President’s Counsel asserted that President 
Trump had longstanding concerns about cor-
ruption and burden-sharing by European al-
lies in support of Ukraine. Upon careful re-
view of the record, these assertions simply 
do not square with the facts. While there is 
some basis for the assertion that President 
Trump cared about these issues, they were 
not the basis for the withholding of Ukraine 
security assistance. 
Evidence shows that President Trump’s so-
licitation alarmed Administration officials 
who listened in to the July 25th call, and 
their concerns did not stem from policy dif-
ferences. NSC official Lt. Col. Vindman tes-
tified that he was ‘‘concerned’’ about the call 
and ‘‘did not think it was proper to demand 
that a foreign government investigate a U.S. 
citizen.’’ 193 Vice Presidential aide Jennifer 
Williams, who also listened to the July 25th 
call, testified she found it, ‘‘unusual because, 
in contrast to other Presidential calls I had 
observed, it involved discussion of what ap-
peared to be a domestic political matter.’’ 194 
Ms. Williams was informed of the security 
assistance hold on July 3rd and stated that 
the call ‘‘shed some light on possible other 
motivations behind a security assistance 
hold.’’ 195 Lt. Col. Vindman and NSC official 
Tim Morrison were sufficiently concerned 
that they separately reported the contents of 
the call to NSC lawyers, Mr. Eisenberg and 
Mr. Ellis.196 The President’s lawyers, in turn, 
took steps to restrict access to the rough 
transcript of the call by placing it on a high-
ly-restricted classified server.197 
Furthermore, the President’s Counsel’s 
claim that security assistance for Ukraine 
was withheld over concerns about corruption 
is unfounded. On May 23, 2019, the Depart-
ment of Defense certified to Congress that 
Ukraine had made progress on defense re-
form and anti-corruption measures. Congress 
required this certification under the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act in order to 
allow USAI funding to be provided beyond 
the first 50 percent of amounts authorized 
and appropriated for Ukraine military aid.198 
Furthermore, support for providing security 
assistance to Ukraine was unanimous among 
relevant agencies of the United States gov-
ernment. Deputy Assistant Secretary of De-
fense Laura Cooper testified that there was a 
consensus within the interagency that cor-
ruption was not a legitimate reason for the 
hold.199
Ambassador Taylor affirmed Ms. 
Cooper’s recollection that no agencies raised 
policy-related concerns as reason for the 
hold on security assistance testifying, ‘‘At 
every meeting, the unanimous conclusion 
was that the security assistance should be 
reassumed, the hold lifted. At one point the 
Defense Department was asked to perform an 
analysis of the effectiveness of the assist-
ance. Within a day, the Defense Department 
came back with the determination that the 
assistance was effective and should be re-
sumed.’’ 200 
Nor does the evidence support the claim 
that President Trump, himself, had concerns 
about institutional corruption that would 
lead him to withhold military assistance for 
Ukraine. There is no evidence that President 
Trump in his interactions with his Ukrain-
ian counterpart, raised concerns about cor-
ruption. Indeed, corruption was not raised by 
President Trump during the two calls he had 
with President Zelensky,201
despite that 
issue being included in his talking points 
prepared by NSC staff for both calls.202 Fur-
ther evidence that President Trump was not 
interested in institutional corruption in 
Ukraine came from Mr. Morrison, who lis-
tened to the July 25th call, and testified that 
President Trump did not make a ‘‘full- 
throated endorsement of the Ukraine reform 
agenda that I was hoping to hear.’’ 203 
Further, communications by U.S. dip-
lomats to President Zelensky or other 
Ukrainian officials do not indicate that 
President Trump held Ukrainian security as-
sistance due to concern about corruption in 
Ukraine. As discussed earlier, Ambassador 
Volker and Ambassador Sondland had mul-
tiple contacts with President Zelensky and 
his close aide Mr. Yermak ahead of the July 
25th call. No evidence shows that President 
Zelensky was advised to outline steps he was 
taking to address corruption on the call.204 
Similarly, previously discussed diplomatic 
efforts in August focused on securing a pub-
lic commitment by President Zelensky to in-
vestigate the 2016 campaign and Biden/ 
Burisma theories specifically, and a commit-
ment to pursue corruption generally was 
deemed 
insufficient 
to 
meet 
President 
Trump’s request.205 
The evidence also does not indicate that 
President Trump used official auspices to un-
dertake a corruption investigation in fur-
therance of official U.S. government policy. 
If the President was interested in pursuing a 
particular corruption investigation with the 
Government of Ukraine, he could have done 
so through established diplomatic channels. 
The President could have directed his Attor-
ney General to make an official request of 
Ukraine to initiate investigations into cor-
ruption under the existing Mutual Legal As-
sistance Treaty (MLAT) with Ukraine.206 In 
this instance, President Trump did not take 
such action. Rather, in the July 25th call, 
President Trump asked President Zelensky 
to work with both his personal attorney, Mr. 
Giuliani, and Attorney General Barr to pur-
sue investigations into his political rivals.207 
Further, supporting the idea that the Presi-
dent did not ask for any official investiga-
tions, the DOJ has denied knowledge of any 
such investigations, declaring that ‘‘the 
President has not asked the Attorney Gen-
eral to contact Ukraine—on this [the July 
25th call] or any other matter.’’ 208 Addition-
ally, Mr. Yermak asked Ambassador Volker 
to make any official request for investiga-
tions through formal channels,209 but there 
is no evidence that the DOJ or officials at 
the US Embassy Kyiv followed up on that 
suggestion.210 That the President did not go 
through regular inter-governmental chan-
nels supports the conclusion that his inter-
est in Ukrainian investigations was for his 
personal political benefit and not legitimate 
policy considerations. 
In addition, there is no evidence to support 
the claim that President Trump withheld 
Ukrainian military assistance out of con-
cerns about European burden sharing. While 
President Trump may be skeptical about Eu-
ropean contributions to mutual defense, Eu-
ropean nations contribute significantly more 
foreign aid overall to Ukraine than the 
United States. The EU is the single largest 
contributor of foreign assistance to Ukraine, 
having provided Ö15 billion since 2014 versus 
$1.96 billion in security assistance that the 
United States has provided over that same 
time period.211 
The rationale that the President withheld 
security assistance because he was concerned 
with Europe paying more to support Ukraine 
was not raised until well after the hold was 
placed 
on 
U.S. 
security 
assistance 
for 
Ukraine. Witness testimony indicates that 
the President began making inquiries about 
the aid on June 19, 2019,212 and that all secu-
rity assistance for Ukraine had been put on 
hold by July 12, 2019.213 OMB official Mark 
Sandy testified that when the hold was or-
dered no explicit reason was provided.214 Mr. 
Sandy further testified that it wasn’t until 
September, after the hold became public, 
that a concern was expressed about Euro-
pean burden sharing.215 
Nor is there evidence that the Trump Ad-
ministration made any efforts publicly or 
privately to get additional contributions

from Europe while the aid was on hold. Mr. 
Sandy testified that he was not aware of any 
other countries committing to provide more 
financial assistance to Ukraine prior to the 
lifting of the hold on September 11th.216 
Moreover, as the GAO decision makes 
clear, the President does not have the au-
thority to withhold funding that Congress 
has appropriated for a specific purpose. The 
GAO determined ‘‘the law does not permit 
the President to substitute his own policy 
priorities for those that Congress has en-
acted into law. OMB withheld funds for a 
policy reason, which is not permitted under 
the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The 
withholding was not a programmatic delay. 
Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated 
the ICA.’’ 217 
The OMB continued to implement the 
President’s hold on the Ukraine security as-
sistance despite repeated warnings starting 
in early August from Department of Defense 
(DOD) officials that further delays risked 
violating the ICA.218 The OMB-directed hold 
on the apportionment of funds continued 
even after DOD warned that it could no 
longer guarantee that the Department would 
be able to obligate the funds before the end 
of the fiscal year, a clear violation of the 
ICA.219 Ultimately, DOD failed to execute $35 
million of the $250 million obligated for 
USAI before the end of the fiscal year.220 
The President’s Counsel have failed to 
produce credible evidence to support the con-
tention that the President withheld security 
assistance and an Oval Office meeting from 
Ukraine for legitimate policy reasons. In-
stead, an adverse inference can be drawn 
that the President had no legitimate policy 
basis for his actions. Further, the House Im-
peachment Managers have established that 
the President acted for his own personal ben-
efit, specifically to advance the ongoing cor-
rupt scheme to solicit foreign interference in 
the 2020 presidential election. 
E. The President’s Solicitation of Investigations 
into the 2016 Campaign and Biden/Burisma 
Theories was Without Due Consideration of 
U.S. National Interests 
The final element of the offense of abuse of 
power, as previously delineated, is that the 
use of official power, for personal or some 
other corrupt purpose, is made without due 
consideration for the national interest. The 
evidence presented at the Senate trial makes 
clear that in using the powers of his office to 
withhold valuable U.S. security assistance 
and an Oval Office visit for the newly-elected 
Ukrainian President to advance a corrupt 
scheme to solicit foreign interference for his 
personal benefit, President Trump harmed 
the national interest of the United States. 
President Trump’s efforts to leverage two of-
ficial acts to advance a scheme to solicit for-
eign interference in the 2020 election is con-
trary to the national interests of the United 
States in a number of ways. 
First and foremost, President Trump’s 
misuse of the powers of his office threatened 
the heart of the constitutional order itself, 
potentially 
undermining 
our 
democratic 
process. By pressuring Ukraine to engage in 
election interference through the promotion 
of 
two 
unfounded 
theories, 
President 
Trump’s conduct posed an urgent danger to 
the integrity of our constitutional system. If 
the history of the 2016 election can be rewrit-
ten at the President’s direction to cast doubt 
on Russia’s interference, it invites Russia 
and other adversaries to interfere again in 
the future knowing that there will be no con-
sequences. Similarly, it risks distorting the 
integrity of our electoral process if the 
President can leverage the power of the pres-
idency to pressure foreign countries to com-
mit their government resources to dig up 
‘‘dirt’’ on his political opponents in order to 
benefit his reelection. 
Second, President Trump’s corrupt scheme 
threatened U.S. national security objectives 
by advancing a Russian disinformation nar-
rative that it was Ukraine, and not Russia, 
that interfered in the 2016 presidential cam-
paign. The Intelligence Community unani-
mously assessed that ‘‘Russian President 
Vladimir Putin ordered an influence cam-
paign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential 
election.’’ 221 That assessment of the Intel-
ligence Community was affirmed by the bi-
partisan Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence,222 and the Special Counsel’s inves-
tigation.223 
The perpetuation and promotion of a Rus-
sian disinformation operation undermines 
U.S. efforts to protect our electoral institu-
tions from Russian interference and to build 
the resilience of the American people against 
foreign interference. Former NSC official Dr. 
Fiona Hill underscored the importance of 
countering this Russian information warfare 
campaign when she testified before the 
House Intelligence Committee on November 
21, 2019. She assessed: 
The impacts of the successful 2016 Russian 
campaign remains evident today. Our nation 
is being torn apart. Truth is questioned. Our 
highly professional expert career Foreign 
Service is being undermined. U.S. support for 
Ukraine which continues to face armed Rus-
sian aggression is being politicized. The Rus-
sian Government’s goal is to weaken our 
country, to diminish America’s global role, 
and to neutralize a perceived U.S. threat to 
Russian interests. President Putin and the 
Russian security services aim to counter 
U.S. foreign policy objectives in Europe in-
cluding in Ukraine, where Moscow wishes to 
reassert 
political 
and 
economic 
domi-
nance.224 
Third, the President’s withholding of near-
ly $400 million in U.S. security assistance to 
Ukraine undermined U.S. national security 
objectives in the strategic competition with 
Russia, a central pillar of the Administra-
tion’s own National Defense Strategy. NSC 
official Tim Morrison stressed that ‘‘Ukraine 
is on the front lines of a strategic competi-
tion between the West and Vladimir Putin’s 
revanchist 
Russia.’’ 225
He 
added, 
‘‘The 
United States aids Ukraine and her people so 
they can fight Russia over there, and we 
don’t have to fight Russia here.’’ 226 Ambas-
sador Taylor also testified on the importance 
of supporting Ukraine for U.S. national secu-
rity interests. He stressed, ‘‘One of our na-
tional security goals is to resolve conflicts in 
Europe’’ and our aid to Ukraine is ‘‘in sup-
port of a broader strategic approach to Eu-
rope . . .,’’ and is ‘‘to support Ukraine when 
it negotiates with the Russians.’’ 227 
Ambassador Taylor and other witnesses 
were particularly alarmed by the with-
holding of the security assistance because of 
its potential impact on Ukraine at a critical 
time in its conflict with Russia. As Ambas-
sador Taylor testified, ‘‘It’s one thing to try 
to leverage a meeting in the White House. 
It’s another thing, I thought, to leverage se-
curity assistance to a country at war, de-
pendent on both the security assistance and 
the demonstration of support. It was much 
more alarming.’’ 228 Ambassador Taylor fur-
ther underscored the harm from withholding 
vital aid for Ukraine: ‘‘Security assistance 
was so important for Ukraine as well as our 
national interests, to withhold that assist-
ance for no good reason other than help with 
a political campaign made no sense. It was 
counterproductive to all of what we had been 
trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be 
explained. It was crazy.’’ 229 
President Trump’s actions also threatened 
to undermine one of Ukraine’s greatest as-
sets in its conflict with Russia, the bipar-
tisan nature of support for Ukraine in the 
U.S. Congress. Ambassador Taylor advised 
President Zelensky’s close aide Yermak, of 
the ‘‘high strategic value of a bipartisan sup-
port for Ukraine and the importance of not 
getting involved in other country’s elec-
tions.’’ 230 Ambassador Volker also empha-
sized the importance of the bipartisan sup-
port in Congress for U.S. policy toward 
Ukraine.231 
Finally, the President’s efforts to secure 
investigations into the 2016 campaign and 
Biden/Burisma theories undermined U.S. pol-
icy promoting the rule of law and fighting 
corruption, 
which 
included 
discouraging 
partner governments from launching politi-
cally-motivated investigations into domestic 
rivals. Deputy Assistant Secretary George 
Kent, former Deputy Chief of Mission in 
Ukraine, testified to the official U.S. policies 
in place in countries like Ukraine and Geor-
gia, stating that ‘‘having the President of 
the United States effectively ask for a polit-
ical investigation of his opponent would run 
directly contrary’’ to these efforts.232
As 
Chairman Schiff restated on December 18, 
2019: 
On September 14 in Ukraine, when Ambas-
sador Volker sat down with Andriy Yermak, 
the top adviser to Zelensky, and he did what 
he should do. He supported the rule of law, 
and he said: You, Andriy Yermak, should not 
investigate the last President, President 
Poroshenko, 
for 
political 
reasons. 
You 
should not engage in political investigations. 
And do you know what Yermak said: ‘‘Oh, 
you mean like what you want us to do with 
the Bidens and the Clintons? 233 
Based on the above analysis, I find that 
there is overwhelmingly clear and con-
vincing evidence that elements of abuse of 
power have been met and that President 
Trump is guilty on the first Article of Im-
peachment. 
VI. ARTICLE II: OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS 
Article II of House Resolution 755 provides 
that, in the conduct of his office, the Presi-
dent directed the unprecedented and categor-
ical indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas 
issued pursuant to the House’s ‘‘sole Power 
of Impeachment.’’ 234 Article I provides fur-
ther provides that President Trump’s order-
ing the White House and other Executive 
Branch agencies and Executive Branch offi-
cials to defy House subpoenas sought ‘‘to 
seize and control the power of impeachment 
. . . a vital constitutional safeguard vested 
solely in the House of Representatives.’’ 235 I 
will first explain how historical and case 
precedent proves that obstruction of Con-
gress is an impeachable offense. Next, I will 
explain how, through his indiscriminate 
order, President Trump sought to vitiate and 
in fact, did undermine, the lawful authority 
of Congress. Finally, I will explain how each 
of the arguments that the President’s Coun-
sel put forward during the Impeachment 
Trial to justify the President’s obstruction 
do not amount to a lawful cause or excuse. 
A. Obstruction of Congress Is An Impeachable 
Offense 
When any one branch of government seeks 
to obstruct an essential function of another 
branch, it threatens a central feature of our 
republic: the separation of powers.236 In the 
case where a President seeks to derogate the 
authority of another branch, it can also un-
dermine the President’s constitutional obli-
gation to ‘‘take Care that the Laws be faith-
fully executed.’’ 237 
President Trump continues to thwart Con-
gress’ oversight and investigative powers, 
which are essential constitutional functions 
of the Legislative Branch. In McGrain v. 
Daugherty, the Supreme Court firmly estab-
lished that such inquiry power is ‘‘an essen-
tial and appropriate auxiliary to the legisla-
tive function’’ and included the ability to 
seek and enforce demands for information.238

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1193 
February 27, 2020 
The need to comply with subpoena-backed 
requests for information, including in an Im-
peachment, has been explicitly stated. In 
Kilbourn v. Thompson, the Supreme Court 
held that, ‘‘Where the question of such im-
peachment is before either [the House or 
Senate] acting in its appropriate sphere on 
that subject [of impeachment], we see no 
reason to doubt the right to compel the at-
tendance of witnesses, and their answer to 
proper questions, in the same manner and by 
the use of the same means that courts of jus-
tice can in like cases.’’ 239 
Part of Congress’ broad oversight author-
ity is the power to hold sitting presidents ac-
countable for grave misconduct and abuses 
of public trust through Impeachment. In-
deed, Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the U.S. 
Constitution gives the House of Representa-
tives ‘‘the sole Power of Impeachment.’’ 240 
However, an Impeachment inquiry can only 
be discharged through the cooperation of the 
governmental branch being investigated; 
only this branch can provide documents and 
witness testimony related to its own con-
duct. By refusing to provide any informa-
tion, President Trump is trying to stop Con-
gress from gathering relevant information 
and render the Impeachment process tooth-
less.241
As John Quincy Adams noted, it 
would make a ‘‘mockery’’ of the Constitu-
tion’s Impeachment power for Congress to 
have the power to impeach but ‘‘not the 
power to obtain the evidence and proofs on 
which their impeachment was based.’’ 242 
The Judiciary Committee also confirmed 
that subverting the constitutionally vested 
powers of the Legislative Branch can be an 
impeachable offense, when it previously ap-
proved Articles of Impeachment charging 
President Richard Nixon with the failure to 
comply with duly authorized congressional 
subpoenas. The Judiciary Committee ex-
plained that: 
In refusing to produce these papers and 
things, Richard M. Nixon, substituting his 
judgment as to what materials were nec-
essary for the inquiry, interposed the powers 
of the Presidency against the lawful sub-
poenas of the House of Representatives, 
thereby assuming to himself functions and 
judgments necessary to the exercise of the 
sole power of impeachment vested by the 
Constitution in the House of Representa-
tives.243 
Based on the above historical and case 
precedent, I conclude that obstruction of 
Congress can be an impeachable offense. I 
also conclude that a sitting President com-
mits obstruction of Congress by: 
1) Contravening the lawful authority of the 
Legislative Branch; 
2) By imposing the powers of the presi-
dency; 
3) Without lawful cause or excuse. 
B. The House of Representatives Exercised Its 
Lawful Authority in the Impeachment In-
quiry 
As explained in Section V, Subsection A of 
this Memorandum, Congress has broad power 
to conduct oversight and issue demands for 
information, and is vested with the sole 
power to conduct Impeachment. 
In this case, the House of Representatives 
was using both its lawful investigative and 
Impeachment authorities, when it issued 
lawful subpoenas leading up to and after the 
adoption of House Resolution 660 on October 
31, 2019, which formalized the ongoing inves-
tigations into whether sufficient grounds ex-
isted for the House of Representatives to im-
peach President Donald John Trump.244 
On September 9, 2019, the House Commit-
tees on Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and 
Oversight and Reform (hereinafter ‘‘Inves-
tigating Committees’’) first announced that 
they would be starting an investigation into 
reports that President Trump and his associ-
ates might have been seeking assistance 
from the Ukrainian government in his bid 
for reelection.245 As part of this inquiry, the 
Investigating Committees requested that the 
White House provide documents related to 
the President’s July 25th call with the 
Ukrainian President.246 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi subsequently an-
nounced on September 24, 2019 that the 
House would be commencing ‘‘an official Im-
peachment inquiry.’’ 247
The Investigating 
Committees then subpoenaed documents and 
witness testimony from the White House,248 
the Department of State,249 the Department 
of Defense,250 the Office of Management and 
Budget,251 the Department of Energy,252 and 
Rudy Giuliani.253 
Once H.Res. 660 was approved by the House 
on October 31st, the subpoenas issued as part 
of the ongoing investigations leading up to 
the adoption of H.Res. 660 remained in full 
force.254 In addition, the House Intelligence 
Committee issued new subpoenas for witness 
testimony to officials at the National Secu-
rity Council,255
White House,256
Office of 
Management and Budget,257 and the Office of 
the Vice President.258 
As such, I conclude that there is over-
whelmingly clear and convincing evidence 
that the House used its lawful authority in 
conducting its Impeachment inquiry. 
C. President Trump Used the Powers of the 
Presidency to Subvert the Powers of Con-
gress 
President Trump used the vast powers of 
his office to prevent the House of Represent-
atives from exercising its oversight author-
ity and sole power of Impeachment. The 
President did so by ordering the entire Exec-
utive Branch not to cooperate with the 
House Impeachment inquiry. White House 
Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to Speak-
er Pelosi and the Investigating Committees 
on October 8, 2019, declaring that ‘‘President 
Trump cannot permit his Administration to 
participate in this partisan inquiry under 
these circumstances.’’ 259 It is notable that, 
even before sending the October 8th letter, 
President Trump had made his intentions 
clear to obstruct any and all oversight by 
Congress, proclaiming, ‘‘We’re fighting all 
the subpoenas.’’ 260 President Trump further 
asserted, ‘‘As the President of the United 
States, I have an absolute right, perhaps 
even a duty, to investigate, or have inves-
tigated, CORRUPTION, and that would in-
clude asking, or suggesting, other Countries 
help us out!’’ 261 
The President’s sweeping directive on Oc-
tober 8th had the foreseeable effect of ob-
structing, and in fact, did materially thwart, 
the House Impeachment inquiry. Following 
President Trump’s categorical order, the De-
partment of State,262 the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget,263 the Department of En-
ergy,264 and the Department of Defense 265 
failed to produce a single document in re-
sponse to requests or demands for records in 
their possession. To date, the only docu-
ments the Executive Branch has released are 
summaries of President Trump’s phone calls 
with President Zelensky on April 21, 2019 266 
and July 25, 2019.267 Even these documents 
are not complete. The President claimed the 
July 25th call is, ‘‘an exact word for word 
transcript of the conversation.’’ 268 However, 
witness testimony from the House Impeach-
ment inquiry shows that there were key 
omissions. NSC official Lt. Col. Vindman, 
who listened to the calls, testified that edits 
that he provided to the draft July 25th docu-
ment based on his notes were not included in 
the transcript that was released. Lt. Col. 
Vindman’s edits included a reference to 
Burisma and President Trump telling Presi-
dent Zelensky that there are recordings of 
Vice President Biden.269 
Additionally, as a result of the October 8th 
directive, multiple Trump Administration 
officials have defied congressional subpoenas 
and refused to testify in the Impeachment 
proceedings.270 Overwhelming evidence of the 
President’s abuse of power has come to light, 
despite the President’s obstructionist ef-
forts, largely because key Administration of-
ficials risked their jobs and careers to com-
ply with subpoenas and requests issued by 
the House. Even in those cases, agency lead-
ership worked to ensure that these officials 
would only be able to give limited testi-
mony. In particular, the Department of 
State,271 the Department of Defense,272 and 
the Department of Energy 273 prevented Exec-
utive Branch employees who did participate 
as witnesses from accessing documents that 
they identified as directly relevant to the 
Impeachment inquiry—including their phone 
records, emails, notes, and memoranda. As a 
result, these witnesses were denied the op-
portunity to have documents that could have 
helped them give more specific testimony, 
and some had to rely on their own notes and 
recollections.274 
President 
Trump 
personally 
sought, 
through intimidation or influence, to impede 
the testimony of officials that cooperated 
with the House Impeachment inquiry. He 
specifically sought to interfere with the tes-
timonies of Ambassador Gordon Sondland,275 
Ambassador William Taylor,276 Ambassador 
Marie Yovanovitch,277
Lt. Col. Alexander 
Vindman,278 and Jennifer Williams.279 
There is indeed overwhelmingly clear and 
convincing evidence that President Trump 
used the powers of his office to prevent the 
House from exercising its constitutionally 
granted authority to conduct oversight re-
lated to the Impeachment inquiry. 
D. President Trump Obstructed the Impeach-
ment Inquiry Without Lawful Cause or Ex-
cuse 
Whether President Trump obstructed Con-
gress turns on whether there is evidence that 
he had legal cause or excuse for his total 
non-cooperation with the Impeachment in-
quiry. I will address how each of the argu-
ments that the President’s Counsel have 
made in attempting to justify the Presi-
dent’s stonewalling do not provide sufficient 
legal excuse for his conduct. 
D.1. Validity of Congressional Subpoenas 
The President’s Counsel argue that sub-
poenas related to the Impeachment pro-
ceeding are invalid, if they were issued be-
fore the House voted to approve H.Res. 660 
formalizing the Impeachment inquiry on Oc-
tober 31, 2019. In the President’s trial brief, 
Counsel states that ‘‘It was entirely proper 
for Administration officials to decline to 
comply with subpoenas issued pursuant to a 
purported ‘impeachment inquiry’ before the 
House of Representatives had authorized any 
such inquiry. No House committee can issue 
subpoenas pursuant to the House’s Impeach-
ment power without authorization from the 
House itself.’’ 280 Relying on the argument 
that subpoenas issued prior to the passage of 
H.Res. 660 were invalid, the White House, De-
partment of State, and the Department of 
Defense instructed current and former em-
ployees not to testify before the Inves-
tigating Committees in the Impeachment 
proceedings.281 
The President’s Counsel’s argument broad-
ly fails because it goes against well-estab-
lished case law recognizing Congress’ power 
to conduct investigations 282 and issues sub-
poenas,283 even when it is not engaged in an 
Impeachment. Furthermore, the standing 
rules of the House authorize a committee or 
subcommittee, with certain limitations, to 
issue subpoenas ‘‘[f]or the purpose of car-
rying out any of its functions and duties.’’ 284 
Therefore, the relevant question on the va-
lidity of the House subpoenas does not turn

February 27, 2020 
on whether they were issued before or after 
H.Res. 660, as the President’s Counsel argue. 
Rather, it should center on whether they 
were issued as part of a lawful congressional 
investigation.285 In this case, the subpoenas 
at issue involved the legitimate purpose of 
investigating whether President Trump and 
his associates sought assistance from the 
Ukrainian government to influence the 2020 
election. As a result, there is convincing evi-
dence that the House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, the House For-
eign Affairs Committee, and the House Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform had valid 
investigative and subpoena authority, even 
before the passage of H.Res. 660. 
Even if the argument made by the Presi-
dent’s Counsel was legitimate, the Trump 
Administration failed to abide by its rule. 
Following the President’s Counsel’s own 
logic, the President would have to recognize 
the validity of and comply with subpoenas 
issued after the Impeachment inquiry was 
formalized on October 31, 2019. Yet, the 
President did not permit officials from OMB 
and the National Security Council to testify 
even though they were subpoenaed after 
H.Res. 660 passed the House.286 
D.2. Assertions of Privilege 
To the extent that the President has legiti-
mate executive privilege claims, he failed to 
properly assert them or to go through the 
proper accommodation process to keep infor-
mation confidential. 
D.2.a. Presidential privilege is not absolute 
The President’s Counsel have stood by the 
October 8th letter from Mr. Cipollone to 
Speaker Pelosi declaring that the President 
and his Administration would not partici-
pate in the Impeachment inquiry.287 Presi-
dent Trump himself has articulated his ex-
pansive view of his powers saying, ‘‘Hon-
estly, we have all the material . . . They 
don’t have the material.’’ 288 
However, in United States v. Nixon, the Su-
preme Court flatly rejected this kind of un-
limited assertion of executive power. The 
Court held that ‘‘neither the doctrine of sep-
aration of powers, nor the need for confiden-
tiality of high-level communications, with-
out more, can sustain an absolute, unquali-
fied Presidential privilege of immunity from 
judicial process under all circumstances.’’ 289 
Instead, the Court found that, in an inter- 
branch dispute, when a claim of presidential 
privilege is based merely on the grounds of a 
generalized interest in confidentiality, ‘‘the 
generalized assertion of privilege must yield 
to the demonstrated, specific need for evi-
dence.’’ 290 
A related D.C. Circuit Court case, Senate 
Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Ac-
tivities v. Nixon, affirmed that presidential 
privilege is not absolute and could be over-
come by a ‘‘strong showing of need by an-
other institution of government.’’ 291
The 
Court in this case articulated the following 
test in making its decision: Congress in 
using its investigative powers may override 
presidential privilege when it makes the req-
uisite showing of need that ‘‘the subpoenaed 
evidence is demonstrably critical to the re-
sponsible fulfillment of the Committee’s 
function,’’ such as a legitimate oversight or 
legislative purpose.292 
In this case, Mr. Cipollone’s October 8th 
letter makes clear the President intended to 
exercise privileges over the whole of the Ex-
ecutive Branch, regardless of whether an 
agency was involved in foreign policy or na-
tional security policy.293 In contrast, the In-
vestigating 
Committees 
overwhelmingly 
demonstrated a particularized interest in ob-
taining information to ascertain whether the 
President used the powers of his office to so-
licit foreign interference on his behalf in the 
2020 election. In addition, it would be hard to 
think of a setting where congressional need 
for information is greater than during an Im-
peachment, which is the Constitution’s most 
potent way to hold the President account-
able for his misconduct.294 
The President’s Counsel further assert that 
senior advisors to the President do not have 
to comply with congressional subpoenas be-
cause they have ‘‘absolute immunity.’’ This 
doctrine of absolute immunity has also been 
rejected by the D.C. District Court in House 
Judiciary Committee v. Miers 295 and House Ju-
diciary Committee v. McGahn.296 
D.2.b. Accommodation of legislative branch 
Moreover, even if President Trump did 
have a legitimate need to keep information 
confidential, each branch of government is 
required to accommodate the legitimate 
needs of the others to maintain the separa-
tion of powers. If President Trump had a 
valid need to keep confidential some of the 
information that the House requested, the 
agencies and offices involved could have en-
tered into good-faith negotiations with the 
House to resolve their conflicting needs. The 
Courts have suggested that the Framers in-
tended dynamic compromise as the most ef-
fective way to solve disputes between the 
branches and that view has been affirmed by 
the longstanding historical practice of the 
branches.297 In United States v. AT&T, the 
D.C. Circuit Court held that ‘‘Under this 
view, the coordinate branches do not exist in 
an exclusively adversary relationship to one 
another when a conflict in authority arises. 
Rather, each branch should take cognizance 
of an implicit constitutional mandate to 
seek optimal accommodation through a real-
istic evaluation of the needs of the con-
flicting branches in the particular fact situa-
tion.’’ 298 
It is this accommodation process that is 
the norm, not a wholesale refusal by one 
branch to another. ‘‘Cooperation dominates 
most congressional requests for information, 
with the executive turning over the re-
quested information as a matter of rou-
tine.’’ 299 A complete breakdown in these pro-
cedures is a rarity as ‘‘information access 
disputes are typically worked out through 
one of several intermediate options’’ such as 
the Executive Branch agency providing re-
dacted documents or requiring Congress to 
keep the requested information confiden-
tial.300 A memorandum written by the Office 
of Legal Counsel (OLC) during the adminis-
tration of President George H. W. Bush ex-
plains that ‘‘[I]f further negotiation is 
unavailing, it is necessary to consider asking 
the President to assert executive privi-
lege.’’ 301
Traditionally, Executive Branch 
agency branch officials then present their 
case for the assertion of executive privilege 
to the President and the agency asks Con-
gress to hold its request in abeyance, pend-
ing the President’s decision.302 
The President’s Counsel claim that the Ex-
ecutive Branch was willing to enter into an 
accommodation process with the House.303 
However, whereas the presumption in an 
inter-branch dispute is cooperation, the 
White House’s default position has been total 
refusal of the House’s requests for informa-
tion. To this day, the Trump Administration 
has not turned over a single responsive docu-
ment or worked to make a single witness 
available for questioning by Congress. The 
Administration has not sought an inter-
mediate option to make information avail-
able to Congress. Nor has the Executive 
Branch ever formally invoked executive 
privilege or asked Congress to hold its re-
quests in abeyance pending the President’s 
decision to assert executive privilege. 
D.2.c. Obstruction in Senate trial 
President Trump’s obstruction of Congress 
and his failure to resolve disputes with the 
Legislative Branch in good faith continued 
into the Senate trial, as his Administration 
continued to withhold the information that 
was subpoenaed during the House inquiry. 
The President’s Counsel even went so far as 
to instruct the Senate that it could not con-
sider the evidence the House did obtain say-
ing that ‘‘The Senate may not rely on a cor-
rupted factual record derived from constitu-
tionally deficient proceedings to support a 
conviction of the President of the United 
States.’’ 304 
In addition, as the Senate Impeachment 
proceedings were underway, new and mate-
rial evidence of President Trump’s mis-
conduct continued to come out. Lev Parnas, 
the associate of Rudy Giuliani, asserted that 
President Trump was fully aware of efforts 
to dig up ‘‘dirt’’ on his political rival, as 
were Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney 
General William Barr, and former Energy 
Secretary Rick Perry.305 According to news 
reports, it also has come to light that Presi-
dent Trump directed John Bolton, his then- 
national security adviser, to help with his 
pressure campaign against the Ukrainian 
government.306 Both Bolton and Parnas made 
it clear during the Impeachment trial that 
they were willing to testify before the Sen-
ate.307 Yet, President Trump sought to dis-
credit both witnesses 308 and even threatened 
to assert executive privilege to prevent John 
Bolton from coming to testify and cooper-
ating in the Impeachment trial.309 
D.3. Purported Defectiveness of Impeachment 
Inquiry 
The President’s Counsel argue that the 
subpoenas issued by the House are invalid 
not only because of when they were issued. 
They argue that the Impeachment inquiry 
itself is defective and unauthorized and 
therefore any compliance is unnecessary. 
The President’s Counsel argue that ‘‘the 
House has never undertaken the solemn re-
sponsibility of a presidential impeachment 
inquiry without first authorizing a par-
ticular committee to begin the inquiry’’ and 
‘‘[t]hat has also been the House’s nearly un-
broken practice for every judicial impeach-
ment for two hundred years.’’ 310 
As explained in Section V, Subsection D.1 
of this Memorandum, Congress’ power to 
conduct investigations and issue subpoenas, 
even when not as part of an Impeachment, 
has been repeatedly and firmly settled by the 
Courts. Therefore, even if one accepts that 
the Impeachment investigation was invalid 
unless authorized by the House, it does noth-
ing to diminish the power of the committees 
at hand to engage in an oversight investiga-
tion. Nor does it diminish the duty to com-
ply with subpoenas that were issued under 
this oversight authority. 
The President’s Counsel is contradicted by 
the cases of President Johnson and Nixon, 
where a committee of jurisdiction started 
taking steps toward Impeachment before the 
full House took any action. In the Johnson 
Impeachment, the Judiciary Committee con-
sidered Articles of Impeachment before re-
porting them out for a vote by the House.311 
In the case of President Nixon, the Judiciary 
Committee employed a Special Counsel to 
assist in the inquiry, before the House ex-
plicitly authorized the Committee’s inves-
tigation to determine whether the House 
should impeach.312 
What’s more, the President’s Counsel’s po-
sition appears to be that the House must au-
thorize an Impeachment before it has gath-
ered enough evidence to warrant one, and 
also 
that 
a 
congressional 
investigation 
which begins to produce evidence of grounds 
for Impeachment loses its investigative au-
thority until the House votes to formalize 
the Impeachment inquiry. These arguments 
defy both logic and past precedent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1195 
February 27, 2020 
Here, I am also persuaded by the House Im-
peachment Managers’ argument that the 
Constitution grants the ‘‘sole Power of Im-
peachment’’ to the House of Representatives. 
In addition, the Constitution says that, 
‘‘[t]he Senate shall have the sole Power to 
try all Impeachments.’’ 313 Nowhere does the 
Constitution empower the President to uni-
laterally decide that an Impeachment is ille-
gitimate. I conclude that investigations 
leading up to H.Res. 660 and the formal in-
quiry that continued afterward were duly au-
thorized. 
D.4. Further Litigation 
The President’s Counsel argue that its cat-
egorical and comprehensive defiance cannot 
be deemed to be obstruction of Congress be-
cause the House has not sought judicial re-
view of the subpoenas issued as part of the 
Impeachment inquiry. 
This argument is unconvincing given that 
the involvement of the Courts in information 
access disputes between the Legislative and 
Executive Branches has been rare, at least 
with respect to conflicts over House sub-
poenas. As the Congressional Research Serv-
ice explains: 
The traditional preference for political 
rather than judicial solutions seems sup-
ported by the fact that neither Congress nor 
the President appears to have turned to the 
courts to resolve an investigative dispute 
until the 1970s . . . The courts themselves 
have also generally sought to avoid adjudi-
cating investigative disputes between the ex-
ecutive and legislative branches, instead en-
couraging settlement of their differences 
through a political resolution. Consistent 
with that approach, lower federal courts 
have suggested that judicial intervention in 
investigative disputes ‘‘should be delayed 
until all possibilities for settlement have 
been exhausted.’’ . . . [In addition] some evi-
dence suggests that both the House and the 
courts have viewed judicial involvement in 
an impeachment inquiry as inappropriate or 
in excess of the judiciary’s power.314 
Moreover, the argument of the President’s 
Counsel is ineffective in the context of the 
dilatory tactics the Trump Administration 
has been using in other pending cases where 
the House also has subpoenaed documents. In 
particular, the Administration has used ar-
guments which, if taken together, seem to 
assert the President cannot be held account-
able by either the Judicial or Legislative 
Branch. These stall tactics were highlighted 
in a case currently pending in the D.C. Cir-
cuit Court, Committee on the Judiciary v. 
McGahn. In this case, the House Judiciary 
Committee is trying to enforce a subpoena 
against former White House Counsel, Don 
McGahn. The D.C. District Court ruled 
against 
the 
DOJ, 
which 
claimed 
that 
McGahn had absolute immunity from con-
gressional subpoenas for his testimony. In 
its decision, the Judge compares the DOJ’s 
inconsistent arguments in the McGahn case 
with a series of cases regarding congres-
sional subpoenas for the President’s tax re-
turns. The Judge points out that the: 
DOJ stood silent with respect to the juris-
dictional question, as President Trump (in 
his personal capacity) has invoked the au-
thority of the federal courts, on more than 
one occasion, seeking resolution of a dispute 
over the enforceability of a legislative sub-
poena concerning his tax returns. A lawsuit 
that asserts that a legislative subpoena 
should be quashed as unlawful is merely the 
flip side of a lawsuit that argues that a legis-
lative subpoena should be enforced. And it is 
either DOJ’s position that the federal courts 
have jurisdiction to review such subpoena- 
enforcement claims or that they do not. By 
arguing vigorously here that the federal 
courts have no subject-matter jurisdiction to 
entertain the Judiciary Committee’s sub-
poena-enforcement action, yet taking no po-
sition on the jurisdictional basis for the 
President’s maintenance of lawsuits to pre-
vent Congress from accessing his personal 
records by legislative subpoena, DOJ implic-
itly suggests that (much like absolute testi-
monial immunity) the subject-matter juris-
diction of the federal courts is properly in-
voked only at the pleasure of the Presi-
dent.315 
The Judge in the McGahn case also noted 
that the DOJ made conflicting arguments in 
the House’s lawsuit seeking grand jury evi-
dence that contributed to former Special 
Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. The Judge 
goes on to write: 
During oral argument, when one of the 
panelists asked DOJ about the district 
court’s subject-matter jurisdiction to enter-
tain the House’s legal action, DOJ Counsel 
remarked that, while the Executive branch 
was ‘‘not advancing that argument[,]’’ it be-
lieved that DOJ ‘‘certainly has both standing 
and jurisdiction’’ to seek review of the dis-
trict court’s injunction . . . But if DOJ’s po-
sition is that the federal courts have the au-
thority to entertain a legal claim concerning 
the House’s contested request for allegedly 
privileged grand jury materials, how can it 
be heard to argue, nearly simultaneously, 
that the instant Court has no jurisdiction to 
entertain a legal claim concerning the en-
forceability of a House committee’s sub-
poena compelling the testimony of senior- 
level presidential aides?316 
Further litigation is also problematic be-
cause, unlike Presidents Nixon and Clinton 
who were in their second terms, President 
Trump’s misconduct is immediately pre-
ceding and, in anticipation of, the upcoming 
presidential election. The crux of President 
Trump’s scheme was to corruptly use the 
vast powers of his presidency to invite for-
eign interference into the 2020 election in 
order to benefit himself politically. Allowing 
President Trump to delay this Impeachment 
through litigation would enable him to keep 
relevant documents and witnesses from com-
ing out until after the 2020 election. It could 
also embolden him to engage in additional 
unfettered misconduct aimed at increasing 
his chances of getting reelected. 
This threat to the integrity of our elec-
tions is exactly the kind of misconduct that 
the Framers were worried about. In George 
Mason’s view, a risk of election fraud ‘‘fur-
nished 
a 
peculiar 
reason 
in 
favor 
of 
impeachments[.]’’ 317
Another exchange be-
tween two delegates, William Richardson 
Davie and James Wilson, highlights the im-
portance of safeguarding against a corrupt 
president that would cheat to get reelected. 
Davie stated, ‘‘ ‘[i]f he be not impeachable 
whilst in office, he will spare no efforts or 
means whatever to get himself reelected.’ 
[Davie] considered this as an essential secu-
rity for the good behaviour of the Execu-
tive.’’ 318 Wilson concurred with Davie ‘‘in 
the necessity of making the Executive im-
peachable while in office.’’ 319 
D.5. Due Process 
The President’s Counsel assert that the 
Impeachment inquiry is defective because of 
a lack of due process protections for Presi-
dent Trump. Specifically, in Mr. Cipollone’s 
October 8th letter, he asserts that the Presi-
dent was entitled to due process rights dur-
ing the House’s Impeachment inquiry, which 
he was not afforded, including ‘‘the right to 
see all evidence, to present evidence, to call 
witnesses, to have Counsel present at all 
hearings, to cross-examine all witnesses, to 
make objections . . . and to respond to evi-
dence and testimony.’’ 320 
Procedural due process—meaning the legal 
procedures to be used in a proceeding—is 
rooted in basic constitutional principles of 
fundamental fairness. Determining due proc-
ess of the law ‘‘require[s] . . . that state ac-
tion, whether through one agency or an-
other, shall be consistent with the funda-
mental principles of liberty and justice 
which lie at the base of all our civil and po-
litical institutions and not infrequently are 
designated as ‘law of the land.’ ’’ 321 
In evaluating whether President Trump 
was afforded protections that are consistent 
with the ‘‘fundamental principles of liberty 
and justice,’’ the analysis should center on 
whether he was given rights customarily 
given to presidents in previous Impeach-
ments. 
During the Clinton Impeachment inquiry, 
the President’s Counsel was invited to at-
tend all Judiciary Committee executive ses-
sions and open hearings, was allowed to 
cross-examine witnesses, object to pieces of 
evidence, suggest that the Committee review 
additional evidence, and respond to evidence 
used by the Committee.322 During the Nixon 
Impeachment inquiry, the President’s Coun-
sel was not invited to participate in the Ju-
diciary 
Committee’s 
proceedings 
until 
months after the inquiry’s authorizing reso-
lution was passed.323 Once invited, Nixon’s 
counsel was allowed to attend the initial 
presentation of evidence and respond to it in 
later proceedings, attend later hearings with 
witnesses, submit requests to call witnesses, 
cross-examine witnesses that were called, 
and object to pieces of evidence.324 
The House’s Impeachment inquiry into 
President Trump afforded the President 
rights that were consistent with these prece-
dents from prior presidential Impeachments. 
The President’s Counsel was given the oppor-
tunity to participate in the House Judiciary 
Committee’s proceedings during the im-
peachment inquiry. This included the right 
to attend every Judiciary Committee hear-
ing; request additional witnesses during 
these hearings; present evidence orally or in 
writing; have the President’s Counsel cross- 
examine witnesses; and raise objections dur-
ing Judiciary Committee hearings.325 In a 
November 29th letter to the President, House 
Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler in-
quired which of these privileges the Presi-
dent’s Counsel wished to exercise.326 In his 
December 6th response, Mr. Cipollone chose 
not to exercise any of these rights and 
claimed the Impeachment inquiry violated 
due process rights.327 
After reviewing this comparison, I con-
clude President Trump has been afforded as 
least as much due process protection as 
Presidents Nixon and Clinton, and therefore 
standards of fundamental fairness requisite 
for due process have been met in the current 
Impeachment proceeding. 
Based on the above analysis, I find that 
there is overwhelmingly clear and con-
vincing evidence that President Trump ob-
structed the House Impeachment inquiry 
without lawful cause or excuse and that 
President Trump is guilty on the second Ar-
ticle of Impeachment. 
VII. LACK OF EVIDENTIARY RECORD 
A. Senate’s Role in Lack of Witnesses and Docu-
ments 
As I have explained, the House of Rep-
resentatives, as part of its Impeachment in-
quiry, subpoenaed documents and witnesses 
from multiple Executive Branch agencies. To 
date, the Administration has produced zero 
responsive documents. In fact, the Adminis-
tration has engaged in a coordinated and 
systematic effort to deny relevant evidence 
and testimony to the House of Representa-
tives in defiance of lawful Congressional sub-
poenas.328 
Fortunately, patriotic and law-abiding fed-
eral employees and former officials complied

with lawful subpoenas and appeared at depo-
sitions or public hearings. As described pre-
viously, testimony provided by witnesses is 
probative of the President’s guilt on both Ar-
ticles of Impeachment. 
Once the Articles of Impeachment were re-
ceived by the Senate, the Senate had the op-
portunity to utilize its own oversight and 
Impeachment authority pursuant to Article 
I of the Constitution to gather relevant doc-
uments and testimony. However, in this Im-
peachment trial, unlike previous ones con-
ducted by the Senate, whether of Presidents 
or other officials, no witnesses were al-
lowed.329 
My Republican colleagues voted against 
holding a fair trial. For example, Leader 
McConnell initially sought to have a set of 
rules governing this Impeachment trial that 
would not have included a provision to auto-
matically adopt the House’s evidence.330 He 
also sought to have twenty-four hours of 
opening arguments over two days to speed up 
the trial.331 My Republican colleagues re-
lented on these points, allowing the House 
Impeachment Managers and the President’s 
Counsel to each have twenty-four hours of 
argument over three days.332
The Repub-
lican-authored resolution ultimately did not 
guarantee witnesses, only providing for a 
vote on whether witnesses could be heard at 
the end of arguments and the question pe-
riod.333 From the get-go, my Republican col-
leagues were reluctant to have evidence and 
arguments put in front of the American peo-
ple for judgment. 
My Democratic colleagues offered eleven 
amendments in an effort to ensure a fair 
trial.334 The amendments, if adopted, would 
have permitted Senators and the American 
people to see relevant evidence and hear 
from witnesses. These amendments were de-
feated—almost entirely along party lines.335 
After the question and answer portion of 
the Impeachment trial, the Senate voted on 
amendments offered by my Democratic col-
leagues that would have provided for wit-
nesses and documents.336 These amendments 
were again defeated, largely along partisan 
lines.337 It is crucial to note, that this second 
series of votes was taken after reports that 
Ambassador Bolton’s draft manuscript con-
tained evidence relevant and central to the 
allegations in the Articles of Impeachment. 
Through the end of the trial, the vast major-
ity of my Republican colleagues did not want 
to hear from Ambassador Bolton, other rel-
evant witnesses, or see documents that 
would likely reveal evidence damaging to 
the President. 
Further, Leader McConnell compared his 
approach in this trial to that of the Impeach-
ment Trial of President Clinton, when Sen-
ators voted on whether to hear witnesses at 
the end of arguments.338 Leader McConnell’s 
assertion is disingenuous considering that 
the Clinton Impeachment trial occurred 
after a lengthy and comprehensive investiga-
tion led by the then independent Counsel, 
Kenneth Starr, which included tens of thou-
sands of pages of evidence and recorded testi-
mony. During the Clinton Impeachment 
trial, witnesses had also previously testified 
in grand jury proceedings.339 There were no 
surprises as to what witnesses would say. 
President Trump’s Impeachment Trial rep-
resents a stark departure from what oc-
curred during the Clinton Impeachment 
Trial and indeed, sets a damaging and dev-
astating precedent. 
VIII. CONCLUSION: REMOVAL OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS THE SOLE APPROPRIATE REMEDY 
Conviction and removal of a President 
from office is a high standard, and one that 
should only be arrived at when there are no 
other remedies available. As I laid out dur-
ing the 1999 Impeachment trial of President 
Clinton, ‘‘the independence of the Impeach-
ment process from the prosecution of crimes 
underscores the function of Impeachment as 
a means to remove a President from office, 
not because of criminal behavior, but be-
cause the President poses a threat to the 
Constitutional order.’’ 340 Furthermore, dur-
ing the Clinton Impeachment proceedings, I 
concluded that the President’s improper con-
duct must represent a continuing threat to 
the American people.341 In the current case, 
I have concluded that allowing President 
Trump to remain in office would pose such a 
continuing threat to our electoral system 
and the Constitution. 
A. Subversion of the Constitutional Order and 
an Unaccountable President 
The President’s Counsel have argued that 
even if President Trump abused the power of 
his office to withhold U.S. military assist-
ance to an ally, in order to pressure that 
country to conduct investigations for his 
personal and political benefit, doing so 
would not be an impeachable offense. Ac-
cording to the President’s Counsel, ‘‘If a 
President does something which he believes 
will help him get elected—in the public in-
terest—that cannot be the kind of quid pro 
quo that results in impeachment.’’ 342 It is on 
this basis that the President’s Counsel fur-
ther argue that, even if the President did in 
fact 
condition 
security 
assistance 
for 
Ukraine on politically-motivated investiga-
tions, it would not be an impeachable of-
fense.343 That argument violates the funda-
mental principle of our constitutional sys-
tem that no one is above the law. 
Furthermore, President Trump has shown 
that he will block any congressional check 
on his misuse of office by ignoring subpoenas 
as he pleases, without asserting a lawful 
cause. At the same time, Trump Administra-
tion lawyers have been arguing in various 
court cases that the Judiciary has no role in 
enforcing the very subpoenas from Congress 
that the Administration is resisting. 
President Trump’s defiance of both Con-
gress and the Courts on subpoenas threatens 
to nullify the constitutional authority of 
both the House and Senate, not merely to 
check the personal excesses of any given 
president, but also to oversee the entire Ex-
ecutive Branch. It validates and encourages 
the President’s strategy of large-scale ob-
struction 
of 
congressional 
inquiries. 
It 
emboldens the President to defy investiga-
tions into his misconduct and strengthens 
the President’s determination to resist addi-
tional congressional oversight. 
The result of permitting the Executive 
Branch to wholly disregard Congressional re-
quests for information is not only to neuter 
the Impeachment power, but more pro-
foundly, impact Congress as a fundamental 
check on executive mismanagement, abuse, 
corruption, and overreach embodied in the 
power of congressional oversight. 
B. Ongoing Harm to the Constitutional Order 
An additional basis for seeking the re-
moval of a President from office is that his 
conduct poses continuing harm to the con-
stitutional order. President Trump’s solici-
tation of foreign election interference, based 
on the perpetuation and amplification of 
baseless and unfounded theories that harm 
his political opponents, serves to damage the 
fundamental institutions of our democracy. 
President Trump’s behavior was not a one- 
time indiscretion, but rather part of a pat-
tern of behavior to invite foreign influence 
into our elections which thereby undermines 
the constitutional order and harms the in-
tegrity of our democracy. In 2016, then-can-
didate Trump called on Russia to hack the 
emails of his political rival, Secretary Clin-
ton.344 He also promoted hacked emails from 
Secretary Clinton’s campaign that were sto-
len by Russian Military Intelligence units, in 
order to benefit himself politically in the 
2016 election.345
In June 2019, President 
Trump publicly announced that he would 
take information on his political rival from 
a foreign government.346 Moreover, he pres-
sured Ukraine to announce investigations 
into his political opponents to benefit his 
2020 campaign. Indeed, even after the House 
began its Impeachment inquiry and he was 
confronted by allegations of soliciting for-
eign interference, President Trump doubled 
down by asking China also to investigate the 
Bidens.347 In addition, as stated earlier, his 
personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani as recently 
as December 2019, was working to gather 
disinformation on political opponents.348 
The President has in no way taken respon-
sibility for these actions or shown that he 
understands the consequences of his behavior 
and its harm to the Constitution. After the 
Impeachment trial in 1999, President Clinton 
apologized to the nation and acted contrite. 
In contrast, President Trump has not, in any 
way, admitted wrongdoing and clings to the 
fiction that his call with President Zelensky 
was ‘‘perfect.’’ 349 This lack of remorse, com-
bined with his past and present actions, 
leaves open the possibility that President 
Trump will repeat such offenses in the fu-
ture. 
C. Elections Cannot be the Sole Remedy 
It has been argued that Impeachment and 
removal of the President is not the appro-
priate remedy when the country is roughly 
ten months away from an election. The 
President’s Counsel argue that any judgment 
regarding the President’s actions should be 
left to the American people when they go to 
the polls in November 2020. However, by so-
liciting foreign interference in the coming 
election, President Trump’s actions threaten 
the viability of our elections and the very 
foundation of our constitutional order to 
serve as a check on the President’s conduct. 
The Founders were acutely aware of the 
dangers of foreign election interference. As 
Alexander Hamilton said in Federalist Paper 
Number 68, ‘‘[t]he desire [of] foreign powers 
to gain an improper ascendant in our Coun-
sels’’ was one of ‘‘the most deadly adver-
saries of republican government.’’ 350
The 
Founders knew this risk was inevitable in an 
election setting. In a letter to John Adams, 
Thomas Jefferson wrote ‘‘You are apprehen-
sive of foreign Interference, Intrigue, Influ-
ence. So am I—But, as often as Elections 
happen, the danger of foreign Influence re-
curs.’’ 351 
I reject the notion, put forward by the 
President’s Counsel, that a President who 
believes his reelection is in the best interest 
of the country cannot be impeached for abus-
ing his power to tilt the next election in his 
favor. The Impeachment clause cannot be 
read to provide a carte blanche for the Presi-
dent to engage in illegal acts 352 that directly 
undermine the operation of our free and fair 
electoral system. The remedy for a President 
attempting to corrupt the next election can-
not be allowing the President to corrupt that 
election. Even a well-intentioned autocrat is 
still an autocrat and not a President subject 
to the Constitution. If accepted as true, 
these views would pave the way for the type 
of autocratic government that the Founders 
feared and fought to leave behind. 
For elections to express the will of the 
electorate, they must be free and fair. Elec-
tions must be legitimate, and the public 
must have confidence in them. Even the per-
ception that our elections are tainted would 
lead voters to question whether their vote 
matters. That is why one of our jobs as law-
makers is to ensure the integrity of the elec-
toral process. We work to ensure that every 
vote cast is fairly and accurately counted.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1197 
February 27, 2020 
We work to ensure that external forces, for-
eign or otherwise, cannot sway or pre-deter-
mine the outcome of the election. The 
United States government should not be 
playing a role in advancing the goals of for-
eign powers that seek to use our institutions 
to further their own interests. 
Acquitting President Trump would under-
mine the integrity of our elections and clear 
the way for Russia or other countries to re-
peat in 2020, and beyond, the kind of election 
interference that the Intelligence Commu-
nity unanimously assessed occurred in the 
2016 election. Through acquittal, the Senate 
will give its blessing for President Trump to 
use any means at his disposal to sway the 
next election in his favor, with no con-
sequences. President Trump has already 
demonstrated unequivocally that he has no 
compunction about violating the law, ob-
structing congressional oversight, and put-
ting our nation and allies at risk. The dif-
ference now will be that President Trump 
will know that the Senate will give him 
cover for his future abuses of office. The on-
going threat to the constitutional order 
must be remedied, and therefore removal of 
the President is the only logical finding in 
this case.

Ukraine policy for the Obama Administra-

justice sector, including the firing of then 
Prosecutor General Victor Shokin. The 
Obama administration had urged his resigna-
tion because he was not actively inves-
tigating serious cases of corruption, and 
threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan 
guarantees. The call for Shokin to resign 
was the unanimous position of the United 
States and the West. Multiple witnesses tes-
tified that Vice President Biden was acting 
in accordance with bipartisan US policy to-
wards Ukraine. For example, Ambassador 
Volker stated: ‘‘When Vice President Biden 
made those representations . . . he was rep-
resenting U.S. policy at the time.’’); Im-

and Timothy Morrison Before the H. Perm. Se-
lect Comm. on Intelligence, 116th Cong. 20

President Biden would have been influenced 
in any way by financial or personal motives 
in carrying out his duties as Vice Presi-
dent.’’);

$325,000 to the pro-Trump Super Pac America

(Mr. Shokin had served as the Prosecutor 
General during the Poroshenko administra-
tion from February 2015–March 2016. In the 
fall of 2015, the Obama Administration grew 
concerned that Mr. Shokin, despite promises 
to increase anti-corruption investigations, 
had not followed through, including on 
promises to investigate corruption allega-
tions against the Ukrainian energy company 
Burisma. In March 2016, Vice President 
Biden called for Mr. Shokin to be fired and 
told Ukrainian authorities that the United 
States would withhold $1 billion in loan 
guarantees if he was not relieved of his posi-
tion. The U.S. position that Mr. Shokin 
should be removed and replaced with a pros-
ecutor general that was dedicated to institu-
tional reforms was coordinated with Euro-
pean allies and partners and held popular 
support inside Ukraine. On March 29, 2016, 
the Ukrainian Rada (parliament) voted over-
whelmingly 
in 
approval 
of 
President 
Poroshenko’s decision to fire Mr. Shokin); 
Interview of: George Kent, supra note 63, at 45. 
(Regarding Mr. Shokin, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary Kent, a leading authority on rule 
of law and anti-corruption efforts, assessed 
in his deposition, ‘‘There was a broad-based 
consensus that he [Shokin] was a typical 
Ukraine prosecutor who lived a lifestyle far 
in excess of his government salary, who 
never prosecuted anybody known for having 
committed a crime, and having covered up 
crimes that were known to have been com-
mitted.’’) 
71. Interview of: George Kent, supra note 63, 
at 47. (The Skype call between Mr. Shokin 
and Mr. Giuliani occurred after Mr. Shokin 
was denied a visa to travel to the United 
States, based on his record of corrupt deal-
ings. Deputy Assistant Secretary George 
Kent testified that the State Department ob-
jected to the visa because Mr. Shokin was 
‘‘very well and very unfavorably known to 
us. And we felt, under no circumstances, 
should a visa be issued to someone who 
knowingly subverted and wasted U.S. tax-
payer money.’’ Mr. Kent further testified 
that White House aide Robert Blair called to 
follow up on why Shokin was denied a visa.);

fore the H. Perm. Select Comm. On Intelligence, 
Joint with the Comm. on Oversight and Reform

ed at her closed-door interview, ‘‘The em-
bassy had received a visa application for a 
tourist visa from Mr. Shokin, the previous 
prosecutor general. And he said that he was 
coming to visit his children, who live in the 
United States . . . The consular folks . . . 
got the application, recognized the name, 
and believed he was ineligible for a visa, 
based on his . . . corrupt activities . . . so I 
alerted Washington to this, that this had 
happened. And the next thing we knew, 
Mayor Giuliani was calling the White House 
as well as the Assistant Secretary of Con-
sular Affairs, saying that I was blocking the 
visa for Mr. Shokin, and that Mr. Shokin 
was coming to meet him to provide informa-
tion about corruption at the embassy, in-
cluding my corruption.’’)

Shokin swore in an affidavit that Vice Presi-

istration to fire him to protect Hunter 
Biden. He further testified that he was forced 
out because he was leading ‘‘a wide ranging 
corruption probe’’ of Burisma and that he 
was ‘‘forced to leave office, under direct and 
intense pressure from Joe Biden and the U.S. 
Administration.’’ At the beginning of the af-
fidavit, Shokin wrote that he was making 
the statement at the request of lawyers act-
ing for pro-Putin Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry 
Firtash, who has a history of acting as a 
Russian agent and in July 2019, retained the 
pro-Trump legal team Victoria Toensing and 
Joe DiGenova, who have been working in co-
ordination with Giuliani to further the cor-
rupt scheme. As part of his legal representa-
tion, Mr. Firtash retained Giuliani associate 
Lev Parnas to be his translator. Further-
more, court filings indicate that Mr. Firtash 
wired Mr. Parnas’s wife a million dollars 
through an intermediary. It must be further 
noted that Mr. Giuliani referenced that Ms. 
Toensing would accompany him to the meet-
ing he requested with then President- elect 
Zelensky in mid-May. While the letter did 
not state the purpose of the requested meet-
ing, Mr. Giuliani stated publicly that he in-
tended to tell President Zelensky to pursue

2015, then US Ambassador to Ukraine Geof-
frey Pyatt stated publicly that Shokin’s of-
fice ‘‘not only did not support investigations 
into corruption, but rather undermined pros-
ecutors working on legitimate corruption 
cases.’’

Pyatt

brought up Burisma as an example of an in-

had 
languished

in front of the Ukrainian Parliament (Rada): 
‘‘. . . you cannot name me a single democ-
racy in the world where the cancer of corrup-
tion is prevalent. You cannot name me one. 
They are thoroughly inconsistent. And it’s 
not enough to set up a new anti-corruption 
bureau and establish a special prosecutor 
fighting corruption. The Office of the Gen-
eral Prosecutor desperately needs reform. 
The judiciary should be overhauled. The en-
ergy sector needs to be competitive, ruled by 
market principles—not sweetheart deals.’’)

(De-

no knowledge of the topics discussed on the 
call, the Attorney General opened a Depart-

into the origins of the counterintelligence 
investigation against the Trump campaign 
in 2016. Aspects of this investigation in-
volved contacting foreign leaders and asking 
that their governments investigate aspects 
of their involvement in that investigation. 
For example, at the Attorney General’s re-
quest, the President asked the governments 
of Australia and the United Kingdom to as-
sist with the investigation including looking 
at the role that their intelligence and law 
enforcement agencies played. The New York

154. 166 Cong. Rec. 19, S647 (daily ed. Jan. 
29, 2020) (statement of Mr. Counsel Philbin). 
(For example, the President’s counsel falsely 
claimed that the House Impeachment Man-
agers didn’t try to obtain first hand wit-
nesses while they were making their case in 
the House. The President’s Counsel argued, 
‘‘They didn’t even subpoena John Bolton. 
They didn’t even try to get his testimony. To 
insist now that this body will become the in-
vestigative body—that this body will have to 
do all of the discovery—then, this institution 
will be effectively paralyzed for months on 
end because it will have to sit as a Court of 
Impeachment while now discovery will be 
done. It would be Ambassador Bolton, and if 
there are going to be witnesses, in order for 
there to be, as they said, a fair trial, fair ad-
judication, then, the President would have to 
have his opportunity to call his witnesses, 
and there would be depositions. This would 
drag on for months. Then that will be the 
new precedent.’’ As the House Impeachment 
Managers argued, these assertions do not ac-
tually represent the facts, ‘‘We asked John 
Bolton to testify in the House, and he re-
fused. We asked his deputy, Dr. Kupperman, 
to testify, and he refused. Fortunately, we 
asked their deputy, Dr. Fiona Hill, to testify, 
and she did. We asked her deputy, Colonel 
Vindman, to testify, and he did. We did seek 
the testimony of John Bolton as well as Dr. 
Kupperman, and they refused. When we sub-
poenaed Dr. Kupperman, he sued us. He took 
us to court. When we raised a subpoena with 
John Bolton’s counsel, the same counsel for 
Dr. Kupperman, the answer was, ‘. . .
you 
serve us with a subpoena, and we will sue 
you, too.’’ We knew, based on the McGahn 
litigation, it would take months, if not 
years, to force John Bolton to come and tes-
tify.’’)

what it is they are looking for. And I shared 
that with Andriy [Yermak]. And then Andriy 
came back to me and said: We don’t think 
it’s a good idea. So that was obviously before 
Andriy came back and said: We don’t want to 
do that.’’ Ambassador Volker further elabo-
rated: ‘‘So the Ukrainians were saying that 
just coming out of the blue and making a 
statement didn’t make any sense to them. If 
they’re invited to come to the White House 
on a specific date for President Zelensky’s 
visit, then it would make sense for President 
Zelensky to come out and say something, 
and it would be a much broader statement 
about a reboot of U.S.-Ukraine relations, not 
just on we’re investigating these things [2016/

say is that we have a process for doing that.

through a system of checks and balances.); 
See also Nixon v. Administrator of General 
Services, 433 U.S. 425, 426 (1977). (In Nixon v. 
GSA, the Supreme Court articulated the test

plishing its constitutionally assigned func-

238. McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 
174–175 (1927). (‘‘A legislative body cannot 
legislate wisely or effectively in the absence 
of information respecting the conditions 
which the legislation is intended to affect or 
change; and where the legislative body does 
not itself possess the requisite information— 
which not infrequently is true—recourse 
must be had to others who do possess it. Ex-
perience has taught that mere requests for 
such information often are unavailing, and 
also that information which is volunteered is 
not always accurate or complete; so some 
means of compulsion are essential to obtain 
what is needed. All this was true before and 
when the Constitution was framed and 
adopted. In that period the power of in-
quiry—with enforcing process—was regarded 
and employed as a necessary and appropriate 
attribute of the power to legislate—indeed, 
was treated as inhering in it. Thus there is 
ample warrant for thinking, as we do, that 
the constitutional provisions which commit 
the legislative function to the two houses 
are intended to include this attribute to the 
end that the function may be effectively ex-
ercised.’’)

subpoena power in impeachment cases arises 
directly from an explicit constitutional di-
rective that the House conduct an adjudica-
tive proceeding akin to a grand jury, the suc-
cess of which is necessarily dependent on the 
availability of relevant evidence. Without 
the power to compel compliance with sub-
poenas and the concomitant right to im-
peach a president for refusal to comply, the 
impeachment power would be nullified.’’)

off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast 
forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrain-
ian President spoke unfavorably about her in 
my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. 
President’s absolute right to appoint ambas-
sadors. . . . They call it ‘‘serving at the 
pleasure of the President.’’ The U.S. now has 
a very strong and powerful foreign policy,

nary oversight powers, the Supreme Court 
held in Watkins v. United States that ‘‘[t]he 
power of the Congress to conduct investiga-
tions is inherent in the legislative process. 
That power is broad. It encompasses inquir-
ies concerning the administration of existing 
laws as well as proposed or possibly needed 
statutes. It includes surveys of defects in our 
social, economic or political system for the 
purpose of enabling the Congress to remedy

283. McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 175 
(1927). (The Supreme Court in McGrain v. 
Daugherty elaborated on Congress’ occa-
sional need to compel information, writing 
that ‘‘A legislative body cannot legislate 
wisely or effectively in the absence of infor-
mation respecting the conditions which the 
legislation is intended to affect or change; 
and where the legislative body does not itself 
possess the requisite information—which not 
infrequently is true—recourse must be had 
to others who do possess it. Experience has 
taught that mere requests for such informa-
tion often are unavailing, and also that in-
formation which is volunteered is not always 
accurate or complete; so some means of com-
pulsion are essential to obtain what is need-
ed.’’); See also Watkins v. United States, 354 
U.S. 178, 187–95 (1957); See also Eastland v.

kins that ‘‘In authorizing an investigation by 
a committee, it is essential that the Senate 
or House should spell out the committee’s 
jurisdiction and purpose with sufficient par-
ticularity to insure that compulsory process 
is used only in furtherance of a legislative 
purpose.’’ As such, the Court also held that 
‘‘a congressional investigation into indi-
vidual affairs is invalid if unrelated to any 
legislative purpose, because it is beyond the 
powers conferred upon Congress by the Con-
stitution.’’)

102–103 (2008). (‘‘Congress’s power of inquiry 
is as broad as its power to legislate and lies 
at the very heart of Congress’s constitu-
tional role. Indeed, the former is necessary 
to the proper exercise of the latter: accord-
ing to the Supreme Court, the ability to 
compel testimony is ‘‘necessary to the effec-
tive functioning of courts and legislatures . . . 
Thus, Congress’s use of (and need for vindica-
tion of) its subpoena power in this case is no 
less legitimate or important than was the 
grand jury’s in United States v. Nixon. Both 
involve core functions of a co-equal branch 
of the federal government, and for the rea-
sons identified in Nixon, the President may 
only be entitled to a presumptive, rather 
than an absolute, privilege here. And it is 
certainly the case that if the President is en-
titled only to a presumptive privilege, his 
close advisors cannot hold the superior card 
of absolute immunity.’’)

fense . . . You cannot turn conduct that is 
not impeachable into impeachable conduct

make something 100% clear to the American 
public and anyone running for public office: 
It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, 
or receive anything of value from a foreign 
national in connection with a U.S. election. 
This is not a novel concept. Electoral inter-
vention from foreign governments has been 
considered unacceptable since the beginning 
of our nation. Our Founding Fathers sounded 
the alarm about ‘foreign interference, in-
trigue and influence.’ They knew that when 
foreign governments seek to influence Amer-
ican politics, it is always to advance their 
own interests, not America’s.’’)

STATEMENT ON THE IMPEACHMENT OF 
PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Throughout this impeachment trial, I have 
often thought of an inscription above the 
front door of the Finance Building in Harris-
burg, Pennsylvania from the 1930s: ‘‘All pub-
lic service is a trust, given in faith and ac-
cepted in honor.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1206 
February 27, 2020 
This inscription helped me frame my own 
understanding of the evidence offered during 
this trial because I believe that President 
Trump and every public official in America 
must earn that trust every day. That sacred 
trust is given to us ‘‘in faith’’ by virtue of 
our election. The question for the Presi-
dent—and every official—is: Will we accept 
that ‘‘trust’’ by our honorable conduct? The 
trust set forth in the inscription is an echo 
of Alexander Hamilton’s words in Federalist 
No. 65, where he articulated the standard for 
impeachment as ‘‘offenses which proceed 
from the misconduct of public men, or, in 
other words, from the abuse or violation of 
some public trust.’’ 1 
Much time has been devoted to why and 
how we got here. Let us make no mistake 
about this—we are here because of the Presi-
dent’s conduct. He solicited the interference 
of a foreign government in our next election 
and demanded that same government an-
nounce an investigation of his political oppo-
nent, as well as an investigation into a de-
bunked conspiracy theory about the last 
presidential election. 
President Trump has exhibited an unmis-
takable pattern of behavior that indicates a 
predisposition toward autocratic leadership 
and a willingness to embrace an agenda 
based on foreign propaganda, directly under-
mining the national interests of the United 
States.2 The world watched President Trump 
stand next to Russian President Vladimir 
Putin in Helsinki, Finland in July 2018.3 
When President Trump was asked whether 
he believed President Putin or his intel-
ligence agencies—all of which definitively 
concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 
election 4—President Trump responded: ‘‘My 
people came to me . . . [and] said they think 
it’s Russia. I have President Putin. He just 
said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t 
see any reason why it would be.’’ 5 
After this press conference and despite his 
attempts to retract his comments, President 
Trump faced widespread and bipartisan con-
demnation. Republican members of Congress 
called his performance ‘‘troubling,’’ ‘‘a step 
backwards,’’ ‘‘shameful, ‘‘untenable,’’ ‘‘bi-
zarre and flat-out wrong.’’ 6 However, only 
Senator John McCain offered a forceful re-
buke of President Trump: 
Today’s press conference in Helsinki was 
one of the most disgraceful performances by 
an American president in memory. The dam-
age inflicted by President Trump’s naivete´, 
egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for 
autocrats is difficult to calculate. 
No prior president has ever abased himself 
more abjectly before a tyrant. Not only did 
President Trump fail to speak the truth 
about an adversary; but speaking for Amer-
ica to the world, our president failed to de-
fend all that makes us who we are—a repub-
lic of free people dedicated to the cause of 
liberty at home and abroad. American presi-
dents must be the champions of that cause if 
it is to succeed. Americans are waiting and 
hoping for President Trump to embrace that 
sacred responsibility. One can only hope 
they are not waiting totally in vain.7 
Over a year and a half later, the Presi-
dent’s pattern of conduct has made it clear. 
Just as Senator McCain feared, Americans 
have waited in vain for President Trump to 
embrace—or even understand—his duties as 
a public servant. This President has not and 
never will be faithful to the ‘‘sacred respon-
sibility’’ that he holds as President of the 
United States, nor will he ever truly honor 
the trust that the people placed in him. 
Besides Senator McCain, Republican Sen-
ators failed to fully confront the President 
when he chose the word of a former KGB 
agent over the United States Intelligence 
Community. 
For 
this 
reason, 
it 
is 
unsurprising that our Nation has found itself 
imperiled yet again by another example of 
President Trump’s shameful and dishonor-
able conduct. In response to Republican Sen-
ators who have expressed concern about the 
President’s 
‘‘inappropriate’’ 
conduct 
but 
have repeatedly refused to hold him account-
able, I must ask: What will it take? What ac-
tion will finally be so objectionable, so inap-
propriate to break from this President? He 
will not learn. He will not change. When con-
fronted with a choice between the national 
interests and his personal political interests, 
President Trump will always choose the lat-
ter. The Senate’s failure to hold him ac-
countable in this impeachment trial would 
be a stain on American history. 
After a thorough, careful review of all of 
the available evidence in this impeachment 
trial, I have determined that House Man-
agers have not only met, but exceeded, their 
burden of proof in this case. President 
Trump violated his duty as a public servant 
by corruptly abusing his power to solicit for-
eign interference in the 2020 election and by 
repeatedly obstructing Congress’s constitu-
tionally-based investigation into his con-
duct. President Trump’s clearly established 
pattern of conduct indicates he will continue 
to be a ‘‘threat to national security and the 
Constitution if allowed to remain in office.’’ 8 
For these reasons, I will vote ‘‘guilty’’ on 
both Article I and Article II. 
II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
Before discussing the facts of this case, it 
is important to address the Senate trial 
itself. To ensure a full and fair trial for all 
parties, Senate Democrats repeatedly called 
for relevant witnesses and relevant docu-
ments to be subpoenaed during this trial in 
the Senate.9 The testimonial and documen-
tary evidence would supplement an already 
substantial record presented by the House 
Managers and ensure that this was a fair 
trial for all parties involved. Senate Repub-
licans refused to allow any witnesses and 
documents.10 
Seventy-five percent of Americans sup-
ported calling witnesses during his trial.11 
Unfortunately, President Trump has been 
calling the shots and dictating the Repub-
lican approach to this trial.12 This is the 
third Presidential impeachment trial in our 
country’s history, and it is the only one to 
be completed without calling a single wit-
ness.13 In fact, every completed impeach-
ment trial in history has included new wit-
nesses that were not even originally inter-
viewed in the House of Representatives.14 
By blocking relevant witnesses and rel-
evant documents, Senate Republicans have 
denied the American people the full and fair 
trial they deserve. It is clear that this pro-
ceeding was rigged from the start to protect 
President Trump rather than to hear all of 
the facts. 
III. MATERIAL FACTS 
Special Counsel Mueller & Russian Interference 
in the 2016 Presidential Election 
To fully understand the facts established 
by the House Managers in this case, it is nec-
essary to first understand the context in 
which President Trump engaged in this be-
havior. In May 2017, Special Counsel Robert 
Mueller was appointed to investigate ‘‘ ‘the 
Russian government’s efforts to interfere in 
the 2016 presidential election,’ including any 
links or coordination between the Russian 
government and individuals associated with 
the Trump Campaign.’’ 15
Special Counsel 
Mueller released his comprehensive report in 
April 2019, which established in meticulous 
detail 
that 
Russian 
President 
Vladimir 
Putin personally directed an ongoing and 
systemic Russian attack in the 2016 presi-
dential election in the United States.16 
Special Counsel Mueller’s conclusions were 
also confirmed by the United States Intel-
ligence Community 17
and the bipartisan 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.18 
The Mueller investigation did not find evi-
dence that President Trump’s 2016 campaign 
conspired or coordinated with the Russian 
government, but Special Counsel Mueller did 
confirm that ‘‘the Russian government per-
ceived it would benefit from a Trump presi-
dency and worked to secure that outcome, 
and that the [Trump] Campaign expected it 
would benefit electorally from information 
stolen and released through Russian ef-
forts.’’ 19 For example, then-candidate Trump 
declared during a public rally in July 2016: 
‘‘Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re 
able to find the 30,000 emails that are miss-
ing’’ from then-candidate Hillary Clinton’s 
email server.20
Russian hackers targeted 
Clinton’s personal server within hours of 
Trump’s request.21 After the Mueller Report, 
in June 2019, President Trump was asked 
whether he would accept opposition research 
from a foreign government against his polit-
ical opponent. President Trump responded ‘‘I 
think I’d take it.’’ 22 
Rather than embrace the Special Counsel’s 
investigation and condemn Russian inter-
ference in the election, President Trump re-
portedly tried to undermine the investiga-
tion by calling it a ‘‘witch hunt’’ 23 and a 
‘‘hoax.’’ 24 In fact, in Volume II of his report, 
Special Counsel Mueller detailed the Presi-
dent’s numerous efforts to obstruct the Spe-
cial Counsel’s investigation into Russian in-
terference and his attempts to remove the 
Special Counsel in order to end the inves-
tigation. The Special Counsel identified ten 
separate episodes of potential obstruction of 
justice including, but not limited to: (1) 
President Trump firing former FBI Director 
James Comey; 25
(2) President Trump at-
tempting to fire Special Counsel Mueller; 26 
and (3) President Trump requesting his 
White House Counsel lie and publically deny 
that President Trump tried to fire Special 
Counsel Mueller.27 
Neither Special Counsel Mueller nor Attor-
ney General William Barr charged President 
Trump with a crime for the actions detailed 
in Special Counsel Mueller’s report,28 in part 
because of a controversial Office of Legal 
Counsel opinion indicating that a sitting 
President cannot be indicted for a crime.29 
However, over a thousand former federal 
prosecutors, who served under Republican 
and Democratic administrations, issued a 
statement shortly after the release of the 
Special Counsel’s report that stated, in part, 
as follows: 
Each of us believes that the conduct of 
President Trump described in Special Coun-
sel Robert Mueller’s report would, in the 
case of any other person not covered by the 
Office of Legal Counsel policy against indict-
ing a sitting President, result in multiple 
felony charges for obstruction of justice.30 
After releasing his report in April, Special 
Counsel Mueller testified in front of the 
House Judiciary Committee and the House 
Intelligence Committee on July 24, 2019.31 
During 
his 
testimony, 
Special 
Counsel 
Mueller confirmed that Russia was still en-
gaging in ongoing efforts to attack future 
elections and warned that the United States 
must ‘‘use the full resources that we have to 
address this’’ interference.32 On July 25, one 
day after Special Counsel Mueller testified, 
President Trump spoke on the phone with 
the newly-elected President of Ukraine, 
President Volodymyr Zelensky.33 Unknown 
at the time, this phone call would soon set 
off the comprehensive investigation leading 
to President Trump’s impeachment and the 
current trial in the Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1207 
February 27, 2020 
Volodymyr Zelensky was elected President 
of Ukraine and later that day, President 
Trump called him to congratulate him on his 
victory.34 On that call, President Trump ex-
tended a future invitation to the White 
House and he also promised that he would 
send a ‘‘very, very high level’’ representative 
from the United States to attend President 
Zelensky’s inauguration.35 
Two days after President Trump’s call 
with President Zelensky, on April 23, media 
reports confirmed that former Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden would enter the 2020 presi-
dential race.36 Around this time, the Presi-
dent’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was 
leading a smear campaign to tarnish and re-
move then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, 
Marie Yovanovitch, a respected diplomat 
known for advancing the United States’ anti- 
corruption efforts abroad.37 The smear cam-
paign was also advanced by two ‘‘corrupt 
former prosecutors’’—Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. 
Shokin—in Ukraine.38
It was widely con-
firmed that the corrupt Ukraine prosecutors 
were seeking ‘‘revenge against’’ Ambassador 
Yovanovitch for exposing their misconduct.39 
On the day after the media reported that 
former Vice President Biden was entering 
the presidential race, President Trump re-
called Ambassador Yovanovitch from her po-
sition in Ukraine.40 
Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Giuliani both pro-
moted two conspiracy theories that have 
been pursued by President Trump.41 One of 
the conspiracy theories alleged that Ukraine 
hacked a Democratic National Committee 
(DNC) server in 2016 in order to frame Russia 
for election interference and help the Clin-
ton Campaign.42 The other theory alleged 
that former Vice President Biden coerced the 
Ukrainian 
government 
into 
firing 
Mr. 
Shokin to ‘‘prevent an investigation into 
Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy com-
pany for which Vice President Biden’s son, 
Hunter, served as a board member.’’ 43 Both 
theories have been criticized and debunked 
by officials in the Trump Administration.44 
On May 3, 2019, shortly after President 
Zelensky’s election, President Trump and 
President Putin spoke by telephone and dis-
cussed, in part, the so-called ‘‘Russian 
Hoax,’’ 
referring 
to 
Special 
Counsel 
Mueller’s investigation.45 During that con-
versation, President Putin reportedly spoke 
negatively about Ukraine, suggesting that it 
was corrupt and that President Zelensky was 
‘‘in the thrall of oligarchs.’’ 46 A Washington 
Post article, published on December 19, 2019, 
reported that a senior White House official 
even indicated that President Trump sug-
gested that ‘‘he knew Ukraine was the real 
culprit [of 2016 election interference] because 
‘Putin told me.’ ’’ 47 
On May 9, the New York Times reported 
that the President’s personal attorney, Mr. 
Giuliani, would be traveling to Ukraine to 
pressure the government to open investiga-
tions into the conspiracy theories about 
Burisma and the 2016 election.48 Mr. Giuliani 
specifically acknowledged ‘‘[t]his isn’t for-
eign policy’’ but that the investigations 
‘‘will be very, very helpful to my client.’’ 49 
Around May 13, President Trump ordered 
Vice President Pence not to attend President 
Zelensky’s inauguration and sent a lower- 
ranking delegation, despite his promise to 
President Zelensky to send a ‘‘very, very 
high level’’ representative.50 This delegation 
included Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, 
Ambassador to the European Union Gordon 
Sondland, 
Special 
Representative 
for 
Ukraine 
Negotiations 
Ambassador 
Kurt 
Volker and NSC Director for Ukraine Lieu-
tenant Colonel Alexander Vindman.51 
On May 23, despite positive reports from 
the 
delegation 
regarding 
President 
Zelensky’s effort to combat corruption, 
President Trump said he ‘‘didn’t believe’’ the 
delegation because that was not what Mr. 
Giuliani had told him.52 The President also 
reiterated that Ukraine ‘‘tried to take me 
down’’ during the 2016 election, confirming 
that he still believed the conspiracy theory 
that Ukraine, not Russia, was actually re-
sponsible for 2016 election interference.53 
President 
Trump 
directed 
Ambassador 
Sondland, Secretary Perry and Ambassador 
Volker to ‘‘talk to Rudy’’ and coordinate en-
gagement with the Ukraine government.54 
Despite President Trump’s misplaced con-
cerns about Ukrainian conspiracy theories, 
in May 2019, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) and the State Department certified 
that Ukraine had ‘‘taken substantial ac-
tions’’ to decrease corruption.55 This was im-
portant because it was a necessary require-
ment in order for DOD to release $250 million 
in Ukrainian military assistance that had 
been appropriated and authorized by Con-
gress.56 Congress had also appropriated and 
authorized another $141 million to be admin-
istered by the State Department for security 
assistance to Ukraine.57 
However, by July 12, the President had or-
dered a block on all military and security as-
sistance for Ukraine against overwhelming 
recommendations from across the Executive 
Branch and strong bipartisan support for the 
aid.58 The hold continued throughout August 
in violation of the Impoundment Control Act 
of 1974.59 The President did not initially give 
a reason for the hold, although by Sep-
tember, the President claimed that the hold 
was because he was concerned about corrup-
tion in Ukraine and burden-sharing for 
Ukrainian assistance among European al-
lies.60 
Throughout this time period, it also be-
came clear that President Trump was with-
holding the White House meeting that he 
promised President Zelensky during their 
April 21 phone call.61 Ambassador Taylor, 
Ambassador Yovanovitch’s replacement in 
Ukraine, pushed for the White House meet-
ing, but he learned that the meeting was 
conditioned explicitly on Ukraine publically 
announcing investigations into the 2016 elec-
tion and Burisma.62 Ambassador Sondland 
was unequivocal in his description during his 
testimony: ‘‘Was there a quid pro quo? As I 
testified previously with regard to the re-
quested White House call and the White 
House meeting, the answer is yes.’’ 63 
After a July 10 meeting, Dr. Fiona Hill, 
former Senior Director of European and Rus-
sian Affairs at the National Security Coun-
cil, informed then-National Security Advisor 
John Bolton that Ambassador Sondland reit-
erated the quid pro quo to Ukrainian offi-
cials during a meeting at the White House.64 
Dr. Hill testified that Mr. Bolton advised her 
to ‘‘go and tell [the NSC Legal Advisor] that 
I am not part of whatever drug deal 
Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on 
this.’’ 65
Over the next two weeks, Mr. 
Giuliani 
coordinated 
with 
Ambassadors 
Sondland and Volker to arrange a phone call 
between President Trump and President 
Zelensky for President Zelensky to inform 
President Trump that he would announce 
the investigations.66 
On July 25, President Trump spoke on the 
phone with President Zelensky.67
At one 
point, President Zelensky thanked President 
Trump for the ‘‘great support’’ in military 
assistance and indicated that Ukraine would 
be interested in purchasing more Javelin 
anti-tank missiles soon.68 In response, imme-
diately after the Javelin reference, President 
Trump stated as follows: ‘‘I would like you 
to do us a favor though.’’ 69 President Trump 
brought up the investigations that he sought 
into the Ukrainian election interference and 
Biden conspiracy theories.70 After the call, 
Ambassador Sondland informed a State De-
partment aide that President Trump ‘‘did 
not give a [expletive] about Ukraine’’ and he 
only cared only about ‘‘big stuff,’’ meaning 
‘‘ ‘the Biden investigation’ that Mr. Giuliani 
was pushing.’’ 71 
Around that time, the Ukrainian govern-
ment also became aware that President 
Trump was withholding military aid.72 On 
August 
12, 
Ambassadors 
Volker 
and 
Sondland, 
with 
consultation 
from 
Mr. 
Giuliani, edited a draft statement for Presi-
dent Zelensky to publically release that in-
cluded explicit references to ‘‘Burisma and 
the 2016 U.S. elections.’’ 73 On that same day, 
a whistleblower filed a complaint with the 
Intelligence Community Inspector General 
expressing concerns about President Trump’s 
phone call with President Zelensky on July 
25.74 
Ukraine ultimately did not release the 
statement regarding investigations and no 
further action was taken regarding a White 
House meeting.75 Furthermore, there were 
increasing concerns among national security 
officials regarding President Trump’s hold 
on military aid, which many began to under-
stand was meant to pressure Ukraine too.76 
Ambassador Sondland testified that Presi-
dent Trump’s effort to condition release of 
the security assistance on Ukraine announc-
ing investigations was as clear as ‘‘two plus 
two equals four.’’ 77 
On September 7, President Trump and Am-
bassador Sondland spoke on the telephone 
and Ambassador Sondland explained that 
President told him ‘‘there was no quid pro 
quo, but President Zelensky must announce 
the opening of the investigations and he 
should want to do it.’’ 78 Shortly after, on 
September 9, Ambassador Taylor texted Am-
bassadors Sondland and Volker and explic-
itly said, ‘‘I think it’s crazy to withhold se-
curity assistance for help with a political 
campaign.’’ 79 On that same day, the Intel-
ligence Community Inspector General noti-
fied Congress of the August 12 whistleblower 
complaint regarding President Trump’s July 
25 phone call with President Zelensky.80 
Two days later, President Trump unexpect-
edly released his hold on Ukraine’s security 
assistance.81 Since President Trump lifted 
the hold, however, he has continued to press 
Ukraine, and even other foreign countries, to 
open investigations into his political rival.82 
For example, on October 3, President Trump 
stated as follows on the White House lawn: 
Well I would think that if they [Ukraine] 
were honest about it, they’d start a major in-
vestigation into the Bidens. It’s a very sim-
ple answer. They should investigate the 
Bidens. . . . Likewise, China should start an 
investigation into the Bidens because what 
happened in China is just about as bad as 
what happened with Ukraine. So, I would say 
that President Zelensky, if it were me, I 
would recommend that they start an inves-
tigation into the Bidens.83 
To date, President Zelensky still has not 
met with President Trump at the White 
House. 
Congressional Investigations 
As noted above, Congress was notified on 
September 9 of the August 12 whistleblower 
complaint 
regarding 
President 
Trump’s 
phone call with Ukraine.84 Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi announced on September 24 that the 
House would move forward with an official 
impeachment inquiry.85 
On September 9 and September 24, three 
House Committee sent letters to White 
House Counsel Pat Cipollone asking for six 
specific categories of documents related to 
the 
Ukraine 
investigation.86
The 
White 
House did not respond, and as a result, the 
Committees issued a subpoena to Acting 
White 
House 
Chief 
of 
Staff, 
Mick 
Mulvaney.87 
On October 8, Mr. Cipollone responded and 
indicated that ‘‘President Trump cannot per-
mit his Administration to participate in this

partisan 
inquiry 
under 
these 
cir-
cumstances.’’ 88 The letter called the inquiry 
‘‘constitutionally invalid’’ even though the 
Constitution grants the House the sole power 
of impeachment.89 The letter made reference 
to ‘‘long-established Executive Branch con-
fidentiality interests and privileges,’’ 90 al-
though President Trump has never specifi-
cally asserted an executive privilege over a 
single piece of information related to the in-
quiry. 
As a result of President Trump’s blanket 
directive, every Executive Branch agency 
that received an impeachment inquiry re-
quest or subpoena has not complied with the 
request.91 Specifically, the Executive Branch 
has not produced a single document or per-
mitted a single witness to testify in response 
to a subpoena.92 The only witnesses who did 
testify or submit documents did so in direct 
violation of the White House’s directive.93 
IV. ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT 
As we know, Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 
of the Constitution states that ‘‘[t]he Senate 
shall have the sole Power to try all Impeach-
ments.’’ 94 As a Senator reviewing this case, 
I have based my assessment of the evidence 
on the following two questions: 
(1) Did the president do what he is charged 
with in the Articles?; and 
(2) If so, is that action an impeachable of-
fense that warrants removal from office? 
Abuse of Power 
In the first Article of Impeachment, the 
House of Representatives charged President 
Trump with abusing his power as President 
by corruptly ‘‘soliciting the Government of 
Ukraine to publicly announce investigations 
that would benefit his reelection, harm the 
election prospects of a political opponent, 
and influence the 2020 United States Presi-
dential election to his advantage.’’ 95 In this 
case, I have found that the House has pre-
sented substantial, persuasive evidence to 
prove the allegations in Article I. 
First, there is no dispute that the White 
House directly withheld $391 million dollars 
in military aid from Ukraine.96 The Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) held the aid, 
at the direction of the President, despite the 
Department of Defense and the State Depart-
ment certifying that Ukraine was taking 
necessary measures to reduce corruption.97 
Furthermore, all agencies—except OMB— 
strongly supported the release of the aid be-
cause it was in the national interest of the 
United States.98 
Nor is there dispute that President Trump 
withheld a White House meeting with Presi-
dent Zelensky. On his April 21 phone call, 
President Trump explicitly invited President 
Zelensky to the White House in the future.99 
However, after former Vice President Joe 
Biden announced his candidacy for President 
just a few days later, President Zelensky— 
despite numerous efforts—still has not met 
with President Trump at the White House. 
Second, 
the 
evidence 
establishes 
that 
President Trump conditioned the aid and the 
White House meeting on Ukraine announcing 
investigations into Burisma and the 2016 
election. In the July 25 phone call, President 
Trump asked President Zelensky to ‘‘do us a 
favor though’’ and referenced the 2016 elec-
tion 
and 
Burisma 
investigations 
imme-
diately after President Zelensky brought up 
military assistance.100 
Related to the White House meeting, Am-
bassador Sondland could not have been more 
clear when he testified that ‘‘yes,’’ there was 
a quid pro quid conditioning a White House 
meeting with Ukraine announcing investiga-
tions into the Bidens and Burisma.101 He fur-
ther testified that the conditioning of the 
White House meeting and military assist-
ance on Ukraine publically announcing in-
vestigations was as clear as ‘‘2+2=4.’’ 102 
So, the question is: Why? Was President 
Trump acting corruptly to advance his own 
political interests, or was he, as his defense 
attorneys would have us believe, deeply con-
cerned 
about 
ongoing 
‘‘corruption’’ 
in 
Ukraine and ‘‘burden-sharing?’’ 103 The facts 
clearly established that President Trump 
was acting corruptly to further his own po-
litical interests. 
First, while the President’s defense law-
yers have rightly argued that the President 
‘‘defines foreign policy,’’ 104 the facts do not 
support that the President’s actions related 
to Ukraine were based on ‘‘legitimate con-
cerns’’ regarding corruption and burden- 
sharing.105 Also, if the President was so con-
cerned about corruption in Ukraine, why did 
he dismiss one of the Nation’s best corrup-
tion-fighting diplomats, Ambassador Marie 
Yovanovitch? 106 
Second, the President was utilizing his per-
sonal attorney, Mr. Giuliani, to coordinate 
the 
announcement 
of 
investigations 
in 
Ukraine. Mr. Giuliani explicitly said that he 
was not engaged in foreign policy, but was 
acting on behalf of President Trump in his 
‘‘personal capacity.’’ 107 The State Depart-
ment also released a statement in August 
emphasizing that Mr. Giuliani is a private 
citizen acting in his personal capacity and 
‘‘does not speak on behalf of the U.S. govern-
ment.’’ 108 Accordingly, one cannot reason-
ably argue that the investigations pursued 
by Mr. Giuliani were related to ‘‘legitimate’’ 
foreign policy when they were coordinated 
by the President’s personal attorney for the 
President’s personal benefit. 
Third, it was the prior practice of the Ad-
ministration to release aid to Ukraine with-
out delay or regard to alleged corruption and 
burden-sharing concerns. Both of these as-
serted concerns were an after-the-fact dis-
traction from the truth. The Trump Admin-
istration disbursed—without question—ap-
proximately $511 million and $359 million to 
Ukraine in 2017 and 2018, respectively.109 The 
only thing that changed in 2019 was that 
former Vice President Joe Biden announced 
that he was running for President. 
Finally, the proposed investigations into 
Burisma and 2016 election interference were 
debunked conspiracy theories that would 
have only benefited one person—Donald 
Trump. 
Regarding 
Burisma, 
President 
Trump claimed that former Vice President 
Biden corruptly forced Ukraine to fire then- 
Prosecutor General Shokin to avoid further 
investigation into Burisma.110 The truth is 
that Vice President Biden was actually pur-
suing Mr. Shokin’s termination—with bipar-
tisan and international support—because Mr. 
Shokin was a corrupt and ineffective pros-
ecutor.111 In fact, Mr. Shokin was not ac-
tively investigating Burisma and his re-
moval would have made it more likely—not 
less—that Burisma would be investigated in 
the future.112 
Furthermore, even if we were to accept 
that President Trump had legitimate inter-
ests regarding alleged corruption in Ukraine, 
he certainly should not have asked a foreign 
government to announce the investigation. 
Rather, he should have gone through official 
channels and asked the Department of Jus-
tice to look into the allegations.113 Ambas-
sador Sondland indicated that President 
Trump was only concerned about the an-
nouncement of investigations—he was not 
concerned with the actual completion of in-
vestigations.114 President Trump was not ac-
tually interested in corruption in Ukraine, 
but was only concerned with harming a po-
litical opponent with the announcement of 
an investigation. 
Regarding Ukrainian election interference, 
President Trump has suggested that Ukraine 
attempted to help the Hillary Clinton cam-
paign in 2016 by framing Russia and hacking 
a Democratic National Committee server.115 
This theory is not supported by any evi-
dence. The U.S. Intelligence Community, the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller all came to 
the conclusion that Russia, not Ukraine, 
interfered in the 2016 election.116 Dr. Fiona 
Hill called this Ukraine theory a ‘‘fictional 
narrative that is being perpetrated and prop-
agated by the Russian security services’’ to 
raise doubts about Russia’s own culpability 
and to harm the relationship between the 
United States and Ukraine.117
President 
Trump’s former Homeland Security Advisor, 
Tom 
Bossert, 
also 
indicated 
that 
the 
Ukraine theory was ‘‘not only a conspiracy 
theory, it is completely debunked.’’ 118 Pur-
suing such a clearly debunked conspiracy 
theory only served to benefit President 
Trump, and Putin, by raising doubts regard-
ing Russia’s own election interference and 
its preference for President Trump’s election 
in 2016. 
Based on this evidence, it is clear that 
President Trump acted corruptly by condi-
tioning the release of military aid and a 
White House meeting on Ukraine announcing 
investigations into his political opponent. 
Obstruction of Congress 
Under the second Article of Impeachment, 
the House charged that President Trump has 
obstructed Congress by directing the ‘‘the 
unprecedented, categorical, and indiscrimi-
nate defiance of subpoenas issued by the 
House of Representatives pursuant to its 
‘sole Power of Impeachment.’ ’’ 119 I have con-
cluded that the House has presented substan-
tial evidence to prove the allegations in this 
Article. 
On October 8, 2019, during the House im-
peachment inquiry, the White House Counsel 
wrote that ‘‘President Trump cannot permit 
his Administration to participate in this par-
tisan inquiry under these circumstances.’’ 120 
As a result of President Trump’s directives, 
the House did not receive a ‘‘single docu-
ment’’ from the White House, the Vice Presi-
dent, OMB, the Department of State, DOD or 
the Department of Energy—despite 71 re-
quests and demands.121
Furthermore, the 
only witnesses who testified or produced doc-
uments did so in opposition to the Presi-
dent’s directive.122 
President Trump did not assert a single 
claim of ‘‘executive privilege’’ over any spe-
cific document or piece of testimony during 
this inquiry.123 Rather, he issued a blanket 
directive that completely denied the con-
stitutional oversight responsibilities of the 
House.124 Based on this evidence, it is clear 
that President Trump has obstructed Con-
gress. 
V. IMPEACHABLE CONDUCT 
Having established that the President did, 
in fact, engage in the conduct alleged in 
these Articles—I now turn to whether this 
conduct warrants removal from office. 
During the Constitutional Convention of 
1787, our Founders grappled significantly 
with how to elect the Executive, but they 
also debated how to hold the Executive ac-
countable. While some delegates believed 
that the President should only be held ac-
countable at the ballot box through elec-
tions, others voiced the logical concern that 
‘‘if [the President] be not impeachable whilst 
in office, he will spare no efforts or means 
whatever to get himself re-elected.’’ 125 After 
much debate, the Convention voted that the 
Executive shall be ‘‘removable on impeach-
ments’’ 126 and later confirmed the grounds 
for impeachment included ‘‘Treason, bribery 
and 
other 
high 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors.’’ 127 
‘‘High Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ is left 
ambiguous in the Constitution. At the time 
of the drafting, the Founders’ understanding

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1209 
February 27, 2020 
of ‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ was in-
formed by centuries of English legal prece-
dent.128 This understanding was reflected in 
Federalist No. 65, written by Alexander Ham-
ilton, which explained that impeachment 
should stem from an ‘‘abuse or violation of 
some public trust.’’ 129 Noted historian Ron 
Chernow explained that Hamilton’s under-
standing of impeachment should ‘‘count 
heavily because he was the foremost pro-
ponent of a robust presidency, yet he also 
harbored an abiding fear that a brazen dema-
gogue could seize the office.’’ 130 Informed by 
this history, Congress has consistently inter-
preted ‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ 
broadly to mean ‘‘serious violations of the 
public trust.’’ 131 
The President’s defense lawyers argued 
that impeachment requires a violation of a 
criminal 
statute 
to 
be 
constitutionally 
valid.132 This argument is not supported by 
historical precedent, credible scholarship or 
our common sense about the sacred notion of 
the public trust.133 When applying the accu-
rate Hamiltonian standard for impeach-
ment—an ‘‘abuse or violation of some public 
trust’’—it is clear that President Trump’s 
conduct exceeds that standard. Any effort to 
corrupt an election must be met with a swift 
measure of accountability as provided for 
under the impeachment clause in the Con-
stitution. There is no other remedy to con-
strain a President who has acted, time and 
again, to advance his personal interests over 
those of the Nation. 
Furthermore, since his candidacy, Presi-
dent Trump has engaged in substantial and 
ongoing efforts to solicit foreign interference 
in our elections. As detailed in Special Coun-
sel Mueller’s report, the Trump campaign 
routinely welcomed Russian interference in 
the 2016 presidential election because they 
‘‘expected [the Campaign] would benefit 
electorally from information stolen and re-
leased through Russian efforts.’’ 134 As an il-
lustration of just how brazen President 
Trump has become in his conduct, his July 
25 phone call with President Zelensky oc-
curred just one day after Special Counsel 
Mueller testified in Congress, where he 
warned of the ongoing threat of foreign in-
terference in elections.135 As the Washington 
Post reported on September 21 in a story 
written by three reporters who have covered 
the President for several years, the Presi-
dent’s conduct on the Ukraine call revealed 
‘‘a president convinced of his own invinci-
bility—apparently willing and even eager to 
wield the vast powers of the United States to 
taint a political foe and confident that no 
one could hold him back.’’ 136 
The President’s blanket obstruction of 
Congress also substantially imperils our con-
stitutional system of checks and balances. 
Not only has this President taken the un-
precedented step of issuing an outright re-
fusal to cooperate with Congressional over-
sight in this case, but President Trump has 
exhibited an ongoing hostility to oversight 
of his administration. As detailed in Special 
Counsel Mueller’s report, President Trump 
engaged in ten distinct efforts to obstruct 
and curtail investigations into his conduct 
and Russia’s interference in the 2016 elec-
tion.137 It is clear that this President has en-
gaged in an ongoing pattern of behavior that 
threatens to diminish any meaningful future 
oversight of the Executive Branch. 
Given the President’s ongoing pattern of 
corrupt behavior, especially as it relates to 
the next election, I find him ‘‘guilty’’ under 
both Articles of Impeachment. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
Our Founders had the foresight to ensure 
that the power of the President was not un-
limited and that Congress could—if nec-
essary—hold the Executive accountable for 
abuses of power through the impeachment 
process. This Senate trial is not simply 
about grave presidential abuse of power, it is 
about our Democracy, the sanctity of our 
elections and the very values that the 
Founders agreed should guide our Nation. 
The inscription—‘‘[a]ll public service is a 
trust, 
given 
in 
faith 
and 
accepted 
in 
honor’’—serves as a reminder to us all of the 
bedrock principles of our republic. We must 
hold those accountable who violate this sa-
cred trust. President Trump dishonored that 
public trust given to him by abusing his 
power for personal, political gain. In order to 
prevent continuing interference in our up-
coming election and blatant obstruction of 
Congress, the Senate should find him guilty 
under both Articles.

137. See II MUELLER REPORT, supra note 15, 
at 3–4 (summarizing the ten incidents). 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I seek 
recognition today regarding the recent 
impeachment trial of President Donald 
Trump. This was a rare moment in our 
young Nation’s history. We had little 
to guide us other than the Founding 
Fathers’ collective wisdom and sparse 
precedent. 
The process may seem daunting, and 
the debate over even the most basic 
mechanics of the trial could leave the 
future Members of this body suscep-
tible to deception or misinformation. I 
therefore want to offer my thoughts for 
future Senators when this issue inevi-
tably rises again. 
The impeachment trial proceedings 
are unique. It is an inherently political 
process analogous to a legal trial. 
There is a prosecution, represented by 
the House managers, as well as a de-
fense, 
representing 
the 
President. 
There is also a presiding judge, the 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. 
As in a courtroom, the prosecution 
and defense take opposite sides of the 
judge as they make their arguments. 
The burden of proof is on the prosecu-
tors, who must present their evidence, 
and it is the job of the defense to refute 
the arguments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1211 
February 27, 2020 
There is also a jury, the U.S. Senate. 
Like a courtroom jury, we sit in si-
lence throughout the trial listening to 
the arguments of both sides and are 
asked to render a verdict at the conclu-
sion. However, unlike a courtroom but 
as instructed by the Constitution, we 
are not jurors subject to peremptory 
challenge; we are elected officials in-
structed to offer impartial justice 
based on the evidence presented to us. 
We are not expected to check our 
knowledge or our existing relationships 
at the door. If this were a true trial, all 
Senators would have to recuse them-
selves for the inherent bias connected 
to the election certificate they earned. 
As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Fed-
eralist Paper 65, ‘‘In many cases, it 
[impeachment] will connect itself with 
the pre-existing factions, and will en-
list all their animosities, partialities, 
influence, and interest on one side or 
on the other.’’ Rather, we are asked to 
follow our conscience, to hear the argu-
ments of both sides with an open mind 
and deliver a verdict. We also differ 
from courtroom jurors in that we es-
tablish the rules for the proceedings. 
This is done through organizing resolu-
tions we debate and pass. 
Before considering the merits of this 
particular case, it is important to dis-
cuss the idea of impeachment itself in 
light of the present context. During 
President Trump’s hearing, the Presi-
dent’s legal team alluded to the idea 
that a President can do essentially 
whatever he or she wants, and it will 
not be considered an impeachable of-
fense as long as that President’s inter-
ests in doing so align with the interests 
of the United States. 
‘‘If a President does something which 
he believes will help him get elected in 
the public interest, that cannot be the 
kind of quid pro quo that results in im-
peachment,’’ said Alan Dershowitz, a 
member of the President’s legal team, 
during the trial. 
I feel that particular statement is 
wrong. The Constitution grants no 
President absolute power. There is a 
threshold that can be reached. Thank-
fully, this was later clarified by Mr. 
Dershowitz in an opinion piece he 
wrote for The Hill entitled ‘‘I never 
said the President could do anything to 
get re-elected.’’ In it, he said: 
Any action by a politician motivated in 
part by a desire to be reelected was, by its 
nature, corrupt. Moving to my response, I 
listed three broad categories of relevant mo-
tives, which are pure national interest to 
help the military, pure corrupt motive to ob-
tain a kickback, and mixed-motive to help 
the national interest in a way that can also 
help a reelection effort. I said the third mo-
tive was often the reality of politics, and 
helping your own reelection effort cannot by 
itself necessarily be deemed corrupt. 
In the end, it is the duty of every 
Senator to determine whether the 
President acted in a purely self-inter-
ested manner without any regard for 
the national interest. Given the full 
context of his actions, it is clear Presi-
dent Trump did not act in a purely self-
ish, boundless manner. 
While the question of whether a 
President can commit a crime and 
therefore be impeached is firmly set-
tled, there arises another question this 
impeachment trial did not sufficiently 
answer but must be addressed in the fu-
ture. 
The Constitution says it is the job of 
the House of Representatives to im-
peach a President whose trial is held 
before the Senate. According to cur-
rent Senate rules, our body must move 
forward 
with 
impeachment 
pro-
ceedings, but is that according to the 
Constitution? 
Article I, section 3 of the Constitu-
tion states: 
The Senate shall have the sole Power to 
try all Impeachments. When sitting for that 
Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirma-
tion. When the President of the United 
States is tried, the Chief Justice shall pre-
side: And no Person shall be convicted with-
out the Concurrence of two-thirds of the 
Members present. 
With this impeachment behind us, 
now is the time we as a body need to 
evaluate the constitutionality and wis-
dom of our rules requiring the Senate 
to move forward with any impeach-
ment articles. We must reaffirm our 
right to dictate what is considered on 
the Senate floor and when it is consid-
ered, which is not without precedent. 
Article II, section 2 of the Constitu-
tion says: 
He [the President] shall nominate, and by 
and with the Advice and Consent of the Sen-
ate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public 
Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Su-
preme Court, and all other Officers of the 
United States. 
In 2016, after the passing of Supreme 
Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Presi-
dent Barack Obama appointed a Su-
preme Court nominee to replace him. 
However, with the election of a new 
President just months away, the Sen-
ate declared it would not consider this 
particular nominee and would instead 
let the people decide whom they would 
like to nominate a Supreme Court Jus-
tice. 
The Senate was well within its right 
to decide the timing and consideration, 
or lack thereof, of this constitutional 
obligation to consider judicial nomina-
tions, and the same should be true of 
impeachment trials. 
This is a question in need of an an-
swer for future impeachment pro-
ceedings because impeachment articles 
brought by the House completely derail 
Senate legislative activity. We are un-
able to consider legislation, nomina-
tions, or conduct any floor activity. 
While I agree such an enormous re-
sponsibility should elicit our undivided 
attention, it seems illogical to auto-
matically grant primacy to impeach-
ment 
articles, 
especially 
those 
as 
flawed as the ones presented by House 
Democrats. 
The House’s impeachment process 
was entirely partisan. Since the mo-
ment he was sworn in, Democrats 
schemed to remove Donald Trump from 
office. By May of 2017, 26 Democratic 
Members of Congress had called for the 
impeachment 
of 
President 
Trump. 
Speaker PELOSI herself said impeach-
ment was 21⁄2 years in the making. 
When 
House 
Democrats 
finally 
agreed on a reason to impeach the 
President, their vote to begin the proc-
ess received no Republican votes, and 
multiple Democrats voted against it. It 
does not seem unreasonable to me that 
a vote to begin an impeachment in-
quiry which has only partisan support 
and bipartisan opposition—as this one 
did—is not what the Founders had in 
mind and is what they firmly rejected 
and cautioned us against. 
‘‘Complaints are everywhere heard 
from our most considerate and vir-
tuous citizens, equally the friends of 
public and private faith, and of public 
and personal liberty, that our govern-
ments are too unstable, that the public 
good is disregarded in the conflicts of 
rival parties, and that measures are 
too often decided, not according to the 
rules of justice and the rights of the 
minor party, but by the superior force 
of an interested and overbearing major-
ity,’’ Founding Father James Madison 
wrote in Federalist Paper 10. ‘‘However 
anxiously we may wish that these com-
plaints had no foundation, the evi-
dence, of known facts will not permit 
us to deny that they are in some degree 
true.’’ 
When it came time for the House to 
vote on impeaching the President, the 
same ‘‘overbearing majority’’ outcome 
occurred. No minds were changed, but 
the country was further torn apart and 
the process strayed beyond the original 
intent of the Founding Fathers. The 
two Articles of Impeachment before 
this body were, in my view, without 
merit. They were an affront to this in-
stitution and to our Constitution, rep-
resenting the very same partisan de-
rangement that worried our Founding 
Fathers so much that they made the 
threshold for impeachment so high. 
I think it would be universally agree-
able that Impeachment Articles passed 
by a majority of one party and opposed 
by members of both parties at the very 
least fail the spirit of the Constitution. 
To this point, detractors could say the 
partisan nature of this impeachment 
proceeding is the fault of Republicans 
who blindly follow President Trump, 
rather than Democrats whose hatred 
for this President compels them to act 
more than the facts in front of them. 
Such an argument quickly falls apart 
when you read the statements of Re-
publicans who found the President’s ac-
tions inappropriate but did not believe 
they rose to the level of impeachment. 
That argument further corrodes when 
you consider the content of the Im-
peachment Articles and the partisan 
and secretive process House Democrats 
followed in writing them. 
Fundamentally, the Articles of Im-
peachment were incomplete. Demo-
crats did not complete their own inves-
tigation before drafting and ultimately 
passing the articles, which is why Sen-
ate Democrats spent most of their time 
demanding witnesses and more docu-
ments. The House also did not provide

the House had provided similar due 
process to Presidents Nixon and Clin-
ton during their impeachments. The 
denied rights included allowing the 
President to be represented by counsel, 
permitting the President’s counsel to 
be present at all hearings and deposi-
tions, permitting the President’s coun-
sel to present evidence and object to 
the admission of evidence, allowing the 
President’s counsel to call and cross- 
examine witnesses; and giving the 
President’s counsel access to and the 
ability to respond to the evidence of-
fered by the Committee. 
The impeachment process against 
President Trump had been nothing 
more than secretive hearings and selec-
tive leaks designed to sway public 
opinion and hurt the President politi-
cally. It was a hyper-partisan process 
completely void of due process, and 
that never changed until it reached the 
Senate. In our resolution, we also high-
lighted the fact that ‘‘the main allega-
tions against President Trump are 
based on assertions and testimony 
from witnesses whom he is unable to 
confront, as part of a process in which 
he is not able to offer witnesses in his 
defense or have a basic understanding 
of the allegations lodged against him.’’ 
The issue of evidence, both its origin 
and the lack of compelling proof from 
the House managers, became the foun-
dation of this impeachment. This in-
vestigation began because an anony-
mous national security official ap-
proached Democratic chairman ADAM 
SCHIFF with a secondhand claim that 
President Trump sought to withhold 
aid to a foreign country to force it to 
announce it would launch an investiga-
tion into one of the President’s polit-
ical rivals. 
President Trump was quick to offer 
the transcript of the phone call where 
this allegedly occurred. He did, and it 
showed there was, in fact, no quid pro 
quo, and House Democrats in their in-
vestigation were never able to produce 
a firsthand witness to testify other-
wise. 
Future Senators should be sure to 
note the eagerness or reluctance of an 
accused President to share clarifying 
information. President Trump took un-
precedented action to release the tran-
script of the conversation Democrats 
called into question—an action he was 
not legally required to take and most 
of his predecessors have never done. 
Contrast that with President Nixon, 
who fought until the end to hide his re-
corded conversations because he knew 
the contents were damning. Contrast 
President Trump’s actions even further 
with the House Democrats who pursued 
a secretive, one-sided process to craft 
the narrative they wanted. 
Despite several pieces of information 
demonstrating the President’s inno-
cence and none to the contrary, House 
Democrats 
continued 
this 
crusade. 
Their fixation on his removal was a 
conclusion in search of a justification. 
They manufactured criminality from 
a simple phone conversation between 
world leaders, leaked by one of the 
many career bureaucrats who seem to 
have forgotten they work for the elect-
ed leaders in this country, not the 
other way around. Motives matter. In 
the future, Senators should be vigilant 
in figuring out an accuser’s intention. 
There is a common narrative that ca-
reer bureaucrats are simply righteous, 
opinion-less civil servants. This im-
peachment and the actions leading up 
to it prove the exact opposite. By no 
means are all of them evil or ill-willed, 
but this proceeding showed they are far 
from unbiased, and they are capable of 
weaponizing the tools and access they 
are given. 
Unsurprisingly, this led to two Im-
peachment Articles being sent to the 
Senate on a party-line vote that were 
without merit. They were an affront to 
this institution and to our Constitu-
tion, representing the very same par-
tisan derangement that worried our 
Founding Fathers so much they made 
the threshold for impeachment this 
high. 
The Founders created the Senate for 
moments just like this. When Impeach-
ment Articles are sent to the Senate, it 
is not our job to fix the mistakes made 
by the House, and it is not our job to 
finish an investigation it admittedly 
did not complete. It is the Senate’s sol-
emn duty to set aside the heat of the 
moment, 
prevent 
short-term 
stress 
from leading to long-term decay, and 
deliver impartial justice. 
As James Madison said at the Con-
stitutional Convention, ‘‘The Senate is 
to consist in its proceeding with more 
coolness, with more system, and with 
more 
wisdom, 
than 
the 
popular 
branch.’’ That is why, even under the 
cloud of purely partisan politics of the 
House of Representatives, the Senate 
conducted a complete, comprehensive 
trial. The obvious result of which was 
the conclusion that the Democratic-led 
House of Representatives failed to 
meet the most basic standards of proof 
and dramatically lowered the bar for 
impeachment in the future to unac-
ceptable levels. 
With all of this established, we as a 
Congress and as a nation must unite 
around some commonsense changes, 
both to institutional rules and to our 
understanding 
of 
the 
impeachment 
process. Lowering the bar for impeach-
ment undermines our shared demo-
cratic principles. 
Impeachment must be a tool em-
ployed only when the evidence is over-
whelming and well-founded. We must 
discourage future House actions like 
what we just witnessed from ever oc-
curring again. 
We must also find ways to take on a 
bureaucracy run rampant. President 
Trump was impeached because an 
unelected bureaucrat provided false-
hoods to an overly receptive Demo-
cratic House chairman’s office with a 
directive to remove President Trump. 
The opinion of Federal career staff is 
not sacrosanct. Without further action, 
these impeachment proceedings will be 
interpreted as empowering to them, 
rather than a reminder of who holds 
constitutional power. 
Finally, as we seek to apply the les-
sons learned from this historic time, I 
was reminded of the words Chaplain 
Black offered to us during his daily 
opening prayer. ‘‘We must pray for 
God’s will to be done.’’ There is a high-
er power than any of us, and our coun-
try would benefit from remembering 
that more often.

BAHRAIN 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 9 years 
ago this month, citizens of Bahrain 
took up banners to demand a greater 
role in their society and political proc-
ess. 
Bahrain’s ruling monarchy cracked 
down on the peaceful protestors; State 
police and security forces arrested hun-
dreds and killed more than a dozen, ac-
cording to press reports at the time. 
Bahrain’s leaders promised account-
ability and reforms in response to 
international condemnation, but they 
would implement hardly any of them, 
and they rolled back some of the few 
they did implement. 
Indeed, the situation in Bahrain has 
only grown worse. Americans for De-
mocracy and Human Rights in Bahrain 
wrote last year that ‘‘since 2017, the 
government has intensified the repres-
sion through the arrest, detention, and 
conviction of individuals who draw at-
tention to the kingdom’s human rights 
record or criticise the government.’’ 
Last month, Human Rights Watch 
wrote, ‘‘Bahrain’s human rights record 
worsened in 2019, as the government 
carried out executions, convicted crit-
ics for peaceful expression, and threat-
ened social media activists.’’ 
It gives me no great pleasure to point 
out the monarchy’s increasing repres-
sion. I have no personal animosity to-
ward Bahrain, which remains an impor-
tant U.S. ally. 
But the U.S. Government has a 
duty—an obligation—to be honest with 
friends and allies and to hold them to 
a high standard. I regret to say that 
the Obama administration did not do 
nearly enough to hold Bahrain to that 
high standard, as I repeatedly came to 
this floor to discuss. The Trump ad-
ministration has, for its part, been 
even more callously indifferent to the 
regime’s abuses, despite Secretary of 
State Mike Pompeo speaking many 
times about the importance of human 
rights.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1213 
February 27, 2020 
Just last year, Secretary Pompeo 
said America can effect change ‘‘[b]y 
articulating abuses and pressuring non-
compliant regimes.’’ 
I agree. 
So where is Secretary Pompeo when 
it comes to articulating Bahrain’s 
abuses and pressuring Bahrain’s rulers 
to do better? The Secretary, like his 
boss, is missing in action. 
I urge my colleagues to take a hard 
look at Bahrain’s human rights record, 
to talk with victims of the regime and 
hear their stories of persecution. 
As I do every year, I renew my call 
on Bahrain’s rulers to change course 
and open space for dialogue, for free 
thought, and for peaceful expression 
and protest.

CAREER AND TECHNICAL 
EDUCATION MONTH 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, our Na-
tion’s continued progress and the so-
cioeconomic mobility of our citizens 
are contingent on the education and 
skills of the American workforce and 
its ability to adjust to and fulfill the 
needs of the 21st-century economy. Ca-
reer and technical education, CTE, pro-
grams are essential to every student’s 
education, providing them access to 
the important knowledge, skills, and 
credentials needed to obtain careers in 
rapidly growing, high-demand indus-
tries. Today, approximately 11.8 mil-
lion students across the Nation are en-
rolled in CTE programs offered by 
thousands of career academies, com-
prehensive high schools, CTE high 
schools, community colleges, and CTE 
centers. 
Through 
applied 
learning, 
these students obtain workplace skills 
and technical training that mirror in- 
demand positions in the workforce. 
In the next decade, nearly 3 million 
skilled workers will be needed to fill 
infrastructure positions in the United 
States, including jobs related to de-
signing, building, and operating trans-
portation, 
housing, 
telecommuni-
cation, and utilities facilities. CTE 
programs intentionally match skills 
with workforce demands, lowering the 
probability of high school dropout and 
increasing the likelihood of graduating 
on time. These skills-based training 
programs will help fill the estimated 30 
million U.S. jobs available with an av-
erage income annual income of $55,000 
that do not require a bachelor’s degree 
yet necessitate some level of postsec-
ondary education. 
Across Virginia, I hear from manu-
facturers frustrated by the shortage of 
qualified skilled production employ-
ees—roles that require the training and 
instruction provided by CTE. It is es-
sential that we highlight the impor-
tant role of CTE in the country’s abil-
ity to meet the challenges we face in 
economic 
development, 
student 
achievement, and global competitive-
ness. In 2018, Congress affirmed the im-
portance 
of 
CTE 
by 
passing 
the 
Strengthening Career and Technical 
Education for the 21st Century Act 
which supports CTE programs in sec-
ondary and postsecondary education. 
Today, with my Senate CTE Caucus 
cochairs Senator PORTMAN, Senator 
BALDWIN, and Senator YOUNG and more 
than half of my colleagues in the Sen-
ate, I am pleased to introduce a bipar-
tisan resolution to designate February 
as Career and Technical Education, 
CTE, Month. CTE Month encourages 
students, 
parents, 
counselors, 
edu-
cators, and school leaders to learn 
more about the diverse educational op-
portunities offered in their commu-
nities and recognize the valuable role 
of CTE in developing a well-educated 
and highly skilled workforce in the 
United States. 
By formally recognizing CTE Month 
through this resolution, it is our aim 
to raise greater awareness of the im-
portance of improving access to high- 
quality CTE for millions of America’s 
students and our Nation’s ongoing eco-
nomic competitiveness.

RECOGNIZING THE WYOMING 
STOCK GROWERS ASSOCIATION 
Mr. 
BARRASSO. 
Mr. 
President, 
Scott Sims and his family are ranchers 
at McFadden, in southeastern Wyo-
ming. Scott also serves as president of 
the Wyoming Stock Growers Associa-
tion. 
The Sims family are practitioners of 
holistic management and low-cost pro-
duction. They believe they have a re-
sponsibility ‘‘to take care of the land, 
with its weather, beauty, isolation and 
recreation. We strive to live independ-
ently and to follow our passion: with 
power of choice, faith in States rights, 
and freedom from excessive regula-
tion.’’ 
The values the Sims family follows 
in their work and lives are simple: hon-
esty, respect, integrity, trust, fairness, 
tolerance, work ethic, self-work, and 
appreciation of each other and indi-
vidual faiths. 
The Wyoming Stock Growers Asso-
ciation is making plans to celebrate 
their 150th anniversary in 2022. They 
are laying the groundwork for the asso-
ciation to begin its next 150 years of 
service to Wyoming’s livestock busi-
nesses and families with a strong com-
mitment to Wyoming’s resources, the 
industry and their communities. 
In the Winter 2020 edition of Cow 
Country, the official magazine of the 
Wyoming Stock Growers Association, 
Scott authored an article titled ‘‘Defin-
ing the Path Forward.’’ I believe his 
words apply just as much to life in 
America today as they do to the asso-
ciation’s planning for the next 150 
years. I wish the Stock Growers all the 
best as they complete their first 150 
years in Wyoming, and begin their next 
century of work on behalf of Wyo-
ming’s livestock producers. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that an article written by Scott 
Sims be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Cow Country, Winter 2020] 
DEFINING THE PATH FORWARD 
I can only imagine what the founders of 
the Wyoming Stock Growers Association en-
visioned as to what the path forward would 
look like back in 1872. It probably had more 
to do with control of the range and dealing 
with cattle rustling. I am pretty sure their 
vision did not include the range of issues 
that the association deals with today, that 
came about as obstacles developed while 
riding up the path. 
I do know that right now I want to look 
back down the path to the 2019 Winter 
Roundup Convention. Thank you to all that 
attended and made it such a success. There 
was a wide range from older, to young, to 
very young in attendance. There was broad 
representation from other industry groups, 
state and federal agencies, legislators, and 
etc. The point being is that the great diver-
sity, the variety of issues that are dealt 
with, and the huge array of people that come 
to share their knowledge and expertise, 
make for a strong organization. For you 
members that can’t come to the convention, 
feel assured that the Wyoming Stock Grow-
ers is only a phone call away from addressing 
your needs. 
So what does the path forward look like? I 
think that it might look different moving 
forward. Many of us realize that the dynam-
ics of the ranching industry look much dif-
ferent than in past generations. The future 
of the Wyoming Stock Growers is in the 
hands of the next generations. They will 
have the voice as to what is most important 
to their future in the business, and where the 
association might play a role. 
I feel there is a great future in the ranch-
ing business. The way businesses are struc-
tured will have a different look as to the 
land we operate on. There will be land ar-
rangements such as leasing and smarter es-
tate planning to keep family ranches in the 
right hands. There will be marketing oppor-
tunities if you take the time to develop and 
promote a good product. There is no one so-
lution that will make or break the cattle 
business, but ultimately it will come down 
to cattle cycles and how you manage 
through them. There is a role for govern-
ment, but keep it limited. Regenerative agri-
culture is a growing way of management 
that can allow for substantially increasing 
production on the land. Two things that you 
have control over are managing costs, and 
managing the land. Being able to sell what 
you do to improve the health of the land will 
allow you many opportunities. Tell your 
story and tell it with confidence. You may 
find yourself at the table across from people 
that may not understand you. They defi-
nitely won’t understand if you are not there. 
I just gave my thoughts on what I think is 
along the path forward, but what does it look 
like for you? Whatever it is, let’s ride the 
path together as an industry and as members 
of the Wyoming Stock Growers.

TRIBUTE TO LAURA DOVE 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise

Laura began her service many years 
ago as a Senate page. She returned as 
an assistant in the Senate Republican

role as Secretary for the Majority. This 
is quite an honor and an accomplish-
ment, as Secretaries for the Majority 
and the Minority are elected officers 
nominated by the party’s leader. Dur-
ing her time in the Senate, Laura pro-
vided 
much-needed 
parliamentary 
guidance and counsel to Senators. She 
was no stranger to this type of advice, 
as her father served as the Senate Par-
liamentarian for many years. 
Laura has succeeded in every aspect 
of her service to the U.S. Senate, and I 
can personally say she will be greatly 
missed throughout the Upper Chamber. 
I wish her all the best as she transi-
tions to the next exciting chapter in

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO GEORGE PUGH 
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to congratulate Professor George 
Pugh for his distinguished legal career 
and outstanding tenure as an educator 
at the Paul M. Hebert Law Center at 
Louisiana State University LSU. His 
dedication to the law, along with his 
many accomplishments and military 
career, is exceptionally impressive and 
displays his commitment to his com-
munity and fellow American. 
Pugh was born on Bayou Lafourche 
in 1925 and in 1942 began his studies at 
LSU. In the midst of World War II, he 
volunteered for military service and 
was deployed to France. After the war, 
he returned to LSU after three semes-
ters, he enrolled in LSU Law School. 
He earned his juris doctor in 1950 and 
went on to Yale Law School to earn his 
doctorate of juridical science in 1952. 
Later that year, he joined the LSU 
Law School faculty as an assistant pro-
fessor. 
Pugh served 2 years on the Judicial 
Council as the State’s first judicial ad-
ministrator for the Louisiana Supreme 
Court. He is known as the ‘‘intellectual 
father’’ of the Louisiana Code of Evi-
dence, as he and his fellow co-reporters 
confected the Code of Evidence for the 
Louisiana State Law Institute, using 
the Federal Rules of Evidence as its 
model. It would be enacted into state 
law in 1998 and serve as an invaluable 
resource for judges, district attorneys, 
and other legal professionals. In all, he 
has provided 43 years of instruction to 
almost three generations of students. 
Pugh also served as a member of the 
Baton Rouge, LA, and American Bar 
Associations, chairing several commit-
tees. He was a member of the American 
Law Institute and received several in-
vitations to teach at law schools in 
America and around the globe. At LSU, 
he received the ‘‘Hub’’ Cotton Faculty 
Excellence Award and an honorary doc-
torate of law from the University of 
Aix-Marseille III in France, was named 
a Sterling Fellow at Yale Law School, 
and was listed in ‘‘Who’s Who in Amer-
ica.’’ Upon retiring in 1994, the Lou-
isiana Law Review dedicated its Janu-
ary publication to Professor Pugh, as 
he had been its longtime editor and as-
sociate editor. 
I 
cannot 
congratulate 
Professor 
George Pugh without mentioning his 
late wife of 60 years, Jean Hemphill. 
Together, they founded the George W. 
and Jean H. Pugh Institute for Justice 
in 1998, working to promote justice for 
individuals in the administration of 
criminal and civil justice systems in 
Louisiana and around the world. 
Professor Pugh’s compilation of the 
Louisiana Code of Evidence, distin-
guished teaching career, and contribu-
tions to the legal system of Louisiana 
show the extent to which he has used 
his God-given talents to make the 
world a better place. His incredible 
legal career and many awards speak 
volumes to who he is as a Louisianan 
and an American. 
Professor Pugh, you have made our 
State and our Nation proud.∑

TRIBUTE TO FRED AND TRESSIE 
FIKE 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Fred and Tressie Fike of Mineral Coun-
ty for their commitment to helping 
others in the community. 
Fred and Tressie lead the Superior 
Community Church Shoebox Ministry, 
which is part of the Samaritan’s 
Purse’s national initiative, Operation 
Christmas Child Shoebox Ministry. 
Fred and Tressie partner with their 
church and folks in the community to 
provide shoeboxes filled with toys, hy-
giene items, clothes, sewing kits, and 
school supplies around the world to 
children impacted by devastating cir-
cumstances like war, natural disasters, 
poverty and disease. 
When Superior Community Church 
first participated in this ministry 15 
years ago, they were able to deliver 25 
boxes. In 2019, thanks to the leadership 
of Fred and Tressie, they delivered 900. 
It is my honor to recognize Fred and 
Tressie for their generous and selfless 
efforts within their church ministry 
helping children across the world. The 
world is a better place as a result of 
their dedication.∑

REMEMBERING CHARLES PITMAN 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today pay 
tribute to the memory of retired U.S. 
Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Charles Pitman, 
a leader who served in our Nation’s 
Armed Forces for nearly 40 years, earn-
ing the Silver Star, four Distinguished 
Flying Crosses, and a Purple Heart. 
Chuck Pitman was born in Chicago in 
1935 and enlisted in the U.S. Naval Re-
serve in 1952 and the U.S. Marine Corps 
in 1953. A pilot by the age of 14, Chuck 
logged more than 12,000 flight hours 
during his career, flying jets and at-
tack and reconnaissance helicopters. 
He flew three combat tours in Viet-
nam, where his aircraft were shot down 
seven times by enemy fire. 
On January 7, 1973, Chuck was com-
manding officer of the Marine Air Re-
serve Training Detachment in New Or-
leans when he saw a sniper firing at ci-
vilians from a hotel on the news. With-
out approval from his supervisors and 
at the risk of his career with the Ma-
rines, he and his crew flew a Marine 
helicopter loaded with police officers 
to the hotel and helped to end the car-
nage. Many of the police officers and 
survivors credited his actions with sav-
ing countless lives. 
Chuck served as special assistant to 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff during the Iranian hostage crisis. 
By 1990, Chuck was a three-star general 
and retired from the Marine Corps. His 
commands included the Marine Avia-
tion Training Support Group in Pensa-
cola, a role as assistant wing com-
mander for the 3rd Marine Aircraft 
Wing in California, and the command 
of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in 
Japan. 
Chuck spent much of the rest of his 
life in Florida’s Pensacola Beach. He 
volunteered his time with organiza-
tions 
including 
the 
Marine 
Corps 
League of Pensacola and participated 
in numerous veteran’s events through-
out the city, becoming a fixture in the 
community. 
I express my sincere condolences to 
his wife, two sons, and two daughters 
on the loss of an American hero and pa-
triot. May God bless his family during 
this time of sorrow.∑

ting, pursuant to law, Amtrak’s fiscal year 
2021 General and Legislative Annual Report,

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–182. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan urging the United States Congress 
to establish and fund programs that support 
positive health practices for minority moth-
ers; to the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 123 
Whereas, as the country with the highest 
maternal death rate in the developed world, 
the U.S. lags behind many other countries. 
The U.S. also struggles with persistent racial 
disparities. Black mothers in the U.S. die at 
three to four times the rate of white mothers 
according to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. From 2011 to 2013, preg-
nancy-related deaths among black women 
were dramatically higher than women of 
other races, with 43.5 deaths per 100,000 live 
births among black women compared to 12.7 
and 14.4 deaths per 100,000 live births among 
white women and women of other races, re-
spectively; and 
Whereas, Michigan ranks 27th in the na-
tion for its maternal mortality rate, and 
Michigan’s 
pregnancy-related 
mortality 
rates are particularly concerning for black 
women. Between 1999 and 2010, black women 
in Michigan experienced a pregnancy-related 
mortality rate of 50.8 deaths per 100,000 live 
births compared to 16.6 deaths per 100,000 live 
births for white women according to the 
Michigan Maternal Mortality Surveillance 
Project; and 
Whereas, the high death rate of minority 
mothers is one of the widest of all racial dis-
parities in women’s health. Black women are 
22 percent more likely to die from heart dis-
ease than white women and 71 percent more 
likely to die from cervical cancer, but they 
are 243 percent more likely to die from 
pregnancy- 
or 
childbirth-related 
causes. 
Black women are two to three times more 
likely than white women to die from preg-
nancy-related 
conditions, 
such 
as 
preeclampsia, eclampsia, abruptio placentae, 
placenta previa, and postpartum hemor-
rhage. These alarming statistics for black 
maternal health cut across socio-economic 
status, maternal age, and education levels; 
and 
Whereas, despite the nationwide need for 
improvements in maternal health, more than 
100 diseases and conditions receive more 
funding from the National Institutes of 
Health than maternal health; and 
Whereas, it is important to recognize the 
necessity of ending maternal mortality na-
tionally and globally and intensifying initia-
tives to improve maternal health and rights. 
It is vital to bring attention to the state of 
minority and black maternal health, study 
and understand the root causes of poor ma-
ternal health outcomes, and support commu-
nity-driven programs and care solutions. We 
acknowledge the crucial importance of im-
proving prenatal care, overall maternal 
health care, breastfeeding rates, and nutri-
tion. To properly address maternal health 
disparities, it is critical to amplify the 
voices of black mothers, women, families, 
and stakeholders, as well as people from all 
racial and ethnic minorities who are bur-
dened by unjust health disparities; now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we urge the Congress of the United 
States to establish and fund programs that 
support positive health practices for minor-
ity mothers; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the President of the United States 
Senate, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services, and members of 
the Michigan congressional delegation. 
POM–183. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Maine urging the 
United States Congress to provide access to 
banking and insurance services to legal can-
nabis and cannabis-related businesses; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
HOUSE PAPER 1440 
Whereas, despite being illegal at the fed-
eral level, cannabis is now legal in 33 states, 
the District of Columbia, Guam and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which ac-
count for 68% of the population of the United 
States; and 
Whereas, due to the conflict between state 
and federal law, the vast majority of finan-
cial institutions and insurers are unwilling 
to provide services to legal cannabis busi-
nesses, and those that do could be subject to 
severe criminal and civil penalties; and 
Whereas, in addition to legal cannabis 
businesses being denied access to banking 
services, businesses that serve the cannabis 
industry, either directly or indirectly, may 
be denied banking services simply because 
they are being paid with money derived from 
cannabis sales; and 
Whereas, lacking banking services, many 
legal cannabis businesses operate solely in 
cash, and cash-based systems are inefficient, 
expensive and opaque and make illicit activ-
ity more difficult for law enforcement agen-
cies and state regulators to track; and 
Whereas, lacking access to insurance, 
many legal cannabis businesses are unable to 
obtain sufficient coverage for business risks, 
leaving consumers, employees, vendors and 
owners without adequate financial protec-
tion; and 
Whereas, a bipartisan group of 38 attorneys 
general has identified cash associated with 
the cannabis industry as a public safety con-
cern; and 
Whereas, despite guidance from the United 
States Department of the Treasury, Finan-
cial Crimes Enforcement Network to clarify 
federal Bank Secrecy Act expectations, fed-
eral banking regulators lack the legal au-
thority to provide banks a safe harbor from 
federal law; and 
Whereas, the Congress of the United States 
has the sole authority to solve the banking 
and insurance issue by enacting legislation 
that provides protections for insurers, in-
cluding surety bond writers, and financial in-
stitutions that offer services to legal can-
nabis businesses and service providers for 
such businesses; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, re-
spectfully urge and request that the Con-
gress of the United States enact federal laws 
regarding the use and sale of cannabis that 
respect state law and promote public safety 
without compromising federal enforcement 
of money laundering laws against criminal 
enterprises; and be it further 
Resolved, That suitable copies of this reso-
lution, duly authenticated by the Secretary 
of State, be transmitted to the President of 
the United States Senate, the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives and 
each Member of the Maine Congressional 
Delegation. 
POM–184. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the Common-
wealth of Kentucky urging the United States 
Congress to require car manufacturers to im-
prove safety devices on automobiles for the 
protection of children left in cars; to the 
Committee 
on 
Commerce, 
Science, 
and 
Transportation. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 11 
Whereas, vehicular heatstroke is a term 
used by safety experts to describe the death 
of a person, especially a child, left unat-
tended in a vehicle, where even on mild days 
temperatures can reach greater than 100 de-
grees; and 
Whereas, in 2018, a record number of 53 
children died, and in the first half of 2019 at 
least 29 children have died, due to vehicular 
heatstroke; and 
Whereas, more than half of vehicular heat-
stroke cases from 1998 to 2018 were because 
an adult accidently left a child in the vehi-
cle; and 
Whereas, a child’s vehicular heatstroke 
death is a matter of circumstance that could 
happen to any parent and has happened to 
people in all walks of life; and 
Whereas, vehicular heatstroke is one of the 
leading causes of non-crash-related fatalities 
among children; and 
Whereas, technology currently exists, such 
as seat belt clasp monitors, rear door open-
ing sensors, and seat weight sensors, that 
could equip motor vehicles with a system to 
detect the presence of a child in the rear seat 
of a vehicle after the vehicle is turned off 
and the driver exits the vehicle; and 
Whereas, if sensors detect a child is left, 
the system would issue an audible warning; 
and 
Whereas, the installation of such tech-
nology would help prevent heatstroke-re-
lated deaths due to children being left alone 
in a vehicle; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives of 
the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky: 
Section 1. The Kentucky House of Rep-
resentatives respectfully urges the Congress 
of the United States to require automobile 
manufacturers to install safety features that 
will give an audible alert when a child is left 
in the backseat to prevent the deaths of chil-
dren from being left alone in a hot car. Tech-
nology used could include, but not be limited 
to, seat belt monitors, rear door opening sen-
sors, and seat weight sensors. These sensors 
should give an audible alert through the 
car’s horn if the child is not removed within 
a minimum amount of time after the driver 
exits the vehicle. 
Section 2. The Clerk of the House of Rep-
resentatives shall send a copy of this Resolu-
tion to the President and Vice President of 
the United States of America, the Speaker of 
the United States House of Representatives, 
the Minority Leader of the United States 
House 
of 
Representatives, 
the 
Majority 
Leader of the United States Senate, the Mi-
nority Leader of the United States Senate, 
and each member of the Kentucky Congres-
sional Delegation. 
POM–185. A petition from a citizen of the 
State of Texas relative to drug pricing nego-
tiation for Medicare and Medicaid recipients; 
to the Committee on Finance.

TIATIONS 
TO 
ENTER 
INTO 
A 
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH 
THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA 
Mr. MURPHY (for himself and Mr. 
GRAHAM) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Finance: 
S. RES. 506 
Whereas Tunisia has been developing its 
democratic and market-economy institu-
tions since its democratic revolution in 2011; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
and Tunisia share core values, such as re-
spect for human rights, democracy, and the 
rule of law; 
Whereas the democratically elected Gov-
ernment of Tunisia has committed to com-
bat corruption and increase transparency 
and accountability in government institu-
tions, and should continue to work toward 
these important goals; 
Whereas the Government of Tunisia has 
implemented a number of economic reforms 
intended to encourage entrepreneurship and 
small business development, particularly in 
its tax and regulatory regimes, and has 
passed new laws on investment, public-pri-
vate partnerships, and bankruptcy; 
Whereas the efforts of the Government of 
Tunisia to reduce its budget deficit by tight-
ening government spending, reforming do-
mestic subsidies for fuel and foodstuffs, and 
allowing its currency to devalue through 
more exchange rate flexibility have arguably 
caused economic hardships for many fami-
lies; 
Whereas strong economic growth and in-
vestment would help provide the necessary 
resources to reduce unemployment in Tuni-
sia, as well as to further strengthen demo-
cratic institutions and solidify public sup-
port for democratic governance; 
Whereas a vibrant, stable, and prosperous 
democracy in the Middle East and North Af-
rica is in the interest of the United States; 
Whereas the political evolution of Tunisia 
stands as an inspiration for citizens of other 
states aspiring to establish the institutions 
of democracy after a history of autocratic 
rule; 
Whereas Tunisia continues to face serious 
threats to its security from violent extrem-
ist groups operating within the country as 
well as in neighboring countries; 
Whereas, in July 2015, the United States 
designated Tunisia as a major non-NATO 
ally; 
Whereas the Government of Tunisia has 
committed a significant portion of its budget 
to 
defense 
and 
interior 
ministries 
for 
counterterrorism in recent years, at the ex-
pense of economic and social development; 
Whereas Tunisia faces economic chal-
lenges, including high inflation and high un-
employment, 
especially 
among 
young 
Tunisians and college graduates; 
Whereas the United States is committed to 
continuing a strong economic partnership 
with Tunisia as its government undertakes 
reforms to transform its economy to meet 
the aspirations of all of the citizens of Tuni-
sia; 
Whereas closer engagement with Tunisia 
through trade negotiations would encourage 
even greater reform in Tunisia and build its 
capacity to further modernize and develop 
its economy; 
Whereas the United States is Tunisia’s 7th 
largest trading partner; 
Whereas bilateral trade between Tunisia 
and the United States has increased from 
$949,000,000 in 2011 to $1,200,000,000 in 2018, ac-
cording to the United States Census Bureau; 
Whereas the United States and Tunisia 
held the 8th round of Trade and Investment 
Framework Agreement (TIFA) talks in May 
2019; 
Whereas Tunisia is a member of the World 
Trade Organization; 
Whereas Tunisia is currently eligible for 
preferential 
duty 
treatment 
under 
the 
United States Generalized System of Pref-
erences program; 
Whereas 
the 
Bipartisan 
Congressional 
Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 
2015 (TPA) (title I of Public Law 114–26) in-
cludes provisions to require that a trading 
partner adopt, implement, and enforce its 
own labor statutes, and that those statutes 
include internationally recognized core labor 
standards; and 
Whereas, pursuant to the Bipartisan Con-
gressional Trade Priorities and Account-
ability Act of 2015 (TPA), Congress has man-
dated that the President provide a 90-day no-
tification of intent to begin trade negotia-
tions and established principal negotiating 
objectives, which include that parties to a 
trade agreement combat corruption, trade in 
goods and services obtain competitive oppor-
tunities for export, and labor provisions are 
subject to the same dispute settlement pro-
cedures as all other obligations: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that the United States should initiate nego-
tiations to enter into a free trade agreement 
with Tunisia.

clubs— 
(1) donated more than $45,000,000 in cash 
and in-kind gifts to the communities in 
which those clubs were located; and 
(2) completed more than 15,000 volunteer 
hours; 
Whereas the economic stimulus and devel-
opment provided by Minor League Baseball 
clubs extends beyond the cities and towns 
where Minor League Baseball games are 
played to a wide range of diverse geographic 
areas in which 80 percent of the people of the 
United States are located; 
Whereas Minor League Baseball is com-
mitted to promoting diversity and inclusion 
through— 
(1) the Copa de la Diversio´n initiative; 
(2) the MiLB Pride initiative; 
(3) the Fostering Inclusion through Edu-
cation and Leadership Development Program 
(commonly known as the ‘‘FIELD Pro-
gram’’); and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1226 
February 27, 2020 
Whereas Minor League Baseball is the first 
touchpoint with the ‘‘national pastime’’ for 
millions of youth, and the only touchpoint 
for youth located in communities far from 
cities in which Major League Baseball clubs 
are located; 
Whereas Congress has enacted numerous 
statutory exemptions and immunities to pre-
serve and sustain— 
(1) a system for Minor League Baseball; 
and 
(2) the relationship between Minor League 
Baseball and Major League Baseball; 
Whereas the proposed abandonment of 42 
Minor League Baseball clubs by Major 
League Baseball would devastate commu-
nities, bond purchasers, and other stake-
holders that rely on the economic stimulus 
that those Minor League Baseball clubs pro-
vide; 
Whereas Minor League Baseball facilities 
not only house the affiliated team, but also 
serve as venues for community events and 
other sporting competitions; 
Whereas Minor League Baseball clubs en-
rich the lives of millions of people in the 
United States each year through economic, 
social, cultural, and charitable contribu-
tions; and 
Whereas the preservation of Minor League 
Baseball clubs in 160 communities across the 
United States is in the public interest, as 
those clubs will continue to provide afford-
able, family-friendly entertainment to those 
communities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the preservation of Minor 
League Baseball clubs in 160 communities 
across the United States; 
(2) recognizes the unique social, economic, 
and historical contributions that Minor 
League Baseball has made to the lives and 
culture of the people of the United States; 
and 
(3) encourages the continuation in 160 com-
munities across the United States of the 117-

through the continued affiliation of the 
Minor League Baseball clubs in those com-
munities with Major League Baseball.

Whereas Annex B of Resolution 2231 pro-
hibits Iran from exporting weapons and mili-
tary equipment, including to foreign coun-
tries, its proxy militias throughout the re-
gion, and terrorist organizations such as 
Hezbollah and Katai’b Hezbollah; 
Whereas Hassan Nasrallah, the Secretary- 
General of Hezbollah, which is estimated to 
possess at least 100,000 rockets and missiles,

Mr. GARDNER (for himself, Mr. 
MARKEY, and Mr. RISCH) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 510 
Whereas the people of the United States 
and Taiwan enjoy extensive, close, and 
friendly commercial, cultural, and other re-
lations founded in shared strategic interests 
and cemented by a commitment to demo-
cratic values; 
Whereas Taiwan is a free, democratic, and 
prosperous nation of more than 23,000,000 
people and an important contributor to 
peace and stability around the world, and its 
transformation into a robust democracy and 
a strong free market economy with a vibrant 
civil society offers a model for others in the 
Indo-Pacific; 
Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act (Public 
Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), signed into 
law on April 10, 1979, codified the basis for 
continued commercial, cultural, security, 
and other relations between the people of the 
United States and the people of Taiwan, 
serves as the foundation to preserve and pro-
mote continued bilateral bonds, and states 
that it is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to preserve and promote extensive, 
close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and 
other relations between the people of the 
United States and the people on Taiwan, as 
well as the people on the China mainland and 
all other peoples of the Western Pacific area; 
(2) to declare that peace and stability in 
the area are in the political, security, and 
economic interests of the United States, and 
are matters of international concern; 
(3) to make clear that the United States 
decision to establish diplomatic relations 
with the People’s Republic of China rests 
upon the expectation that the future of Tai-
wan will be determined by peaceful means; 
(4) to consider any effort to determine the 
future of Taiwan by other than peaceful 
means, including by boycotts or embargoes, 
a threat to the peace and security of the 
Western Pacific area and of grave concern to 
the United States; 
(5) to provide Taiwan with arms of a defen-
sive character; and 
(6) to maintain the capacity of the United 
States to resist any resort to force or other 
forms of coercion that would jeopardize the 
security, or the social or economic system, 
of the people on Taiwan; 
Whereas the United States and Taiwan 
have built a strong economic partnership in 
which— 
(1) the United States is Taiwan’s second 
largest trading partner; and 
(2) Taiwan is the 10th largest trading part-
ner of the United States and a key destina-
tion for United States agricultural exports; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
and the people of Taiwan share deep cultural 
and personal ties, as exemplified by the large 
flow of visitors and exchanges each year and 
the over 23,000 Taiwanese students who study 
in the United States; 
Whereas the American Institute in Taiwan 
and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Rep-
resentative Office in the United States 
signed a memorandum of understanding in 
June 2015 establishing the Global Coopera-
tion and Training Framework, under which 
Taiwan, the United States, and Japan jointly 
sponsor training programs to share Taiwan’s 
expertise with partners around the world, in-
cluding in the areas of public health, law en-
forcement, disaster relief, energy coopera-
tion, women’s empowerment, digital econ-
omy and cybersecurity, media literacy, and 
good governance; 
Whereas, in 2019, the United States and 
Taiwan also launched Indo-Pacific Demo-
cratic Governance Consultations, to help 
Indo-Pacific countries address governance 
challenges, and a new Pacific Islands Dia-
logue, to help meet the development needs of 
Taiwan’s diplomatic partners in the Pacific; 
Whereas Taiwan has the expertise, willing-
ness, and capability to engage further in 
international efforts to mitigate global chal-
lenges related to such issues as public 
health, aviation safety, crime, and ter-
rorism, but its participation in such efforts 
has been constrained by conditions imposed 
by the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas successive Congresses have di-
rected the executive branch to develop strat-
egies to obtain meaningful participation for 
Taiwan in international organizations, such 
as the World Health Organization, the Inter-
national Civil Aviation Organization, and 
the International Criminal Police Organiza-
tion (commonly known as ‘‘INTERPOL’’); 
Whereas the Asia Reassurance Initiative 
Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409) states that— 
(1) it is United States policy ‘‘to support 
the close economic, political, and security 
relationship between Taiwan and the United 
States’’; and 
(2) the President should— 
(A) ‘‘conduct regular transfers of defense 
articles to Taiwan that are tailored to 
meet the existing and likely future threats 
from the People’s Republic of China, in-
cluding supporting the efforts of Taiwan to 
develop and integrate asymmetric capa-
bilities, as appropriate, including mobile, 
survivable, and cost-effective capabilities, 
into its military forces’’; and 
(B) ‘‘encourage the travel of high-level 
United States officials to Taiwan, in ac-
cordance with the Taiwan Travel Act’’; 
Whereas, in presidential elections held on 
January 11, 2020, the incumbent President of 
Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, won a second four- 
year term with the most votes for a presi-
dential candidate since Taiwan began direct 
elections, winning 57.1 percent of the presi-
dential vote; and 
Whereas President Tsai stated in her ac-
ceptance speech: ‘‘This election has shown 
that the Taiwanese people hope the inter-
national community will witness our com-
mitment to democratic values and will re-
spect our national identity. We also hope 
that Taiwan will be given a fair opportunity 
to participate in international affairs.’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

and debilitating diseases and containing the 
spread of infectious diseases before they be-
come pandemic health threats; 
Whereas, prior to 2000, resources for and 
access to vaccines for children in the devel-
oping world were declining, immunization 
rates were stagnant or decreasing, and near-
ly 10,000,000 children were dying each year 
before reaching their fifth birthday; 
Whereas, prior to 2000, it was common for 
new life-saving vaccines to take up to 15 
years to be introduced in the world’s least 
developed countries; 
Whereas, in 2000, the United States Gov-
ernment joined forces with the Bill & 
Melinda Gates Foundation, the United Na-
tions Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World 
Health Organization, the World Bank, other 
donor governments, and representatives of 
developing countries, faith-based organiza-
tions, civil society, and the private sector, 
including the vaccine industry, to create the 
Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immuniza-
tion (now known as GAVI or GAVI, the Vac-
cine Alliance), a public-private partnership 
to expand access to new and underused vac-
cines, reduce the incidence of deadly and de-
bilitating diseases, prevent epidemics, and 
save lives; 
Whereas GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance has 
since supported country-led vaccine initia-
tives in 73 countries, enabled immunizations 
for more than 760,000,000 of the world’s most 
vulnerable children, helped avert an esti-
mated 13,000,000 deaths, and contributed to a 
70 percent reduction in the number of deaths 
due to vaccine-preventable diseases; 
Whereas country ownership and sustain-
ability are at the core of the GAVI model, 
which requires each eligible country to com-
mit their own domestic resources to vaccina-
tion and immunization programs; 
Whereas 15 countries have transitioned 
from GAVI support and are now self-financ-
ing their own vaccination and immunization 
programs, three more are expected to transi-
tion by the end of 2020, and an additional 10 
countries are expected to transition by 2025 
(in total, 40 percent of the original set of 
GAVI-eligible countries); 
Whereas GAVI has transformed the market 
for vaccines by pooling demand from devel-
oping countries, securing predictable financ-
ing, expanding the global supplier base, en-
hancing the competitiveness and security of 
supply chains, and creating efficiencies that 
are expected to generate an estimated 
$900,000,000 in savings between 2021–2025; 
Whereas, in addition to its current port-
folio of vaccines, GAVI is working to support 
the roll-out and scale-up of newly approved 
vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus and per-
tussis (DTP) boosters, hepatitis B birth dose, 
multivalent 
meningococcal, 
respiratory 
syncytia (RSV), routine oral cholera, and ra-
bies; 
Whereas GAVI also collaborates with the 
Global Polio Eradication Initiative to bring 
polio vaccines into routine immunization 
programs, strengthen health systems, and 
implement additional polio protections; 
Whereas 
GAVI 
has 
made 
significant 
progress in supporting the development and 
stockpiling of an effective vaccine to combat 
Ebola; 
Whereas GAVI is participating in efforts to 
test and implement an effective vaccine to 
prevent malaria, a disease that kills more 
than 270,000 children a year; 
Whereas, in June 2020, the United Kingdom 
will host GAVI’s third replenishment con-
ference, with an ambitious goal to raise 
$7,400,000,000 in new donor commitments; 
Whereas, with these additional resources, 
GAVI plans to support the immunization of 
300,000,000 children against potentially fatal 
diseases and save an additional 7,000,000 to 
8,000,000 lives between 2021 and 2025; and 
Whereas the United States has been a lead-
ing supporter of GAVI since its inception, 
and its continued commitment will be essen-
tial to the achievement of the alliance’s 
goals for 2021–2025: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commends the work of GAVI and its 
partners for their efforts to expand access 
vaccines and immunizations for the most 
vulnerable men, women, and children in de-
veloping countries; 
(2) affirms the continued support of the 
United States Government for GAVI as an 
efficient and effective mechanism to advance 
global health security and save lives by— 
(A) reducing the incidence of deadly and 
debilitating diseases; 
(B) leveraging donor, partner country, and 
private sector investments in health systems 
capable of sustainably delivering vaccines 
and immunizations; and 
(C) reducing the cost of vaccines while pro-
moting supply chain security and sustain-
ability; 
(3) affirms the support of the United States 
Government for the goal of securing a min-
imum of $7,400,000,000 in donor commitments 
for GAVI’s third replenishment, to be held in 
June 2020 in the United Kingdom; 
(4) urges donor countries and private sec-
tor partners to step up the fight and increase 
their pledges for the third replenishment; 
(5) urges GAVI partner countries to con-
tinue to make and meet ambitious co-financ-
ing commitments to sustain progress in end-
ing vaccine-preventable deaths; and 
(6) encourages the United States Agency 
for International Development (USAID) and 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, in cooperation with GAVI, to continue 
their work to strengthen public health ca-
pacity to introduce and sustain the use of 
new and underused vaccines in routine im-

S. RES. 513 
Whereas 
cardiovascular 
disease 
affects 
men, women, and children of every age and 
race in the United States; 
Whereas, between 2003 and 2013, the death 
rate from cardiovascular disease fell nearly 
30 percent, but cardiovascular disease con-
tinues to be the leading cause of death in the 
United States, taking the lives of approxi-
mately 800,000 individuals in the United 
States each year and accounting for 1 in 3 
deaths across the country; 
Whereas congenital heart defects are the— 
(1) most common birth defect in the United 
States; and 
(2) leading killer of infants with birth de-
fects; 
Whereas, each year, an estimated 800,000 
individuals in the United States have a heart 
attack, of whom an estimated 115,000 die; 
Whereas, in 2015, cardiovascular disease ac-
counted for approximately $555,000,000,000 in 
health care expenditures and lost produc-
tivity; 
Whereas it is estimated that cardio-
vascular disease will account for approxi-
mately $1,093,900,000,000 in health care ex-
penditures and lost productivity annually by 
2035; 
Whereas individuals in the United States 
have made great progress in reducing the 
death rate for cardiovascular disease, but 
this progress has been more modest with re-
spect to the death rate for cardiovascular 
disease in women and minorities; 
Whereas many people do not recognize that 
cardiovascular disease is the leading killer of 
women in the United States, taking the lives 
of over 400,000 women in 2017; 
Whereas over 1⁄2 of all African-American 
adults have some form of cardiovascular dis-
ease, including 57.1 percent of African-Amer-
ican women and 60.1 percent of African- 
American men; 
Whereas Alaska Natives and American In-
dians are more likely to die from cardio-
vascular disease than individuals from other 
ethnic groups; 
Whereas Native Hawaiians have higher 
mortality rates and die at a younger average 
age from cardiovascular disease than other 
ethnic groups in Hawaii;

Whereas many minority women, including 
African-American, 
Hispanic, 
Asian-Amer-
ican, and Native American women and 
women from indigenous populations, have a 
greater prevalence of risk factors or are at a 
higher risk of death from heart disease, 
stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases, 
but are less likely to know of the risk; 
Whereas women constitute about 20 per-
cent of enrolled patients in cardiovascular 
disease clinical trials; 
Whereas, due to the differences in cardio-
vascular disease between men and women, 
more research and data on the effects of car-
diovascular disease treatments for women is 
vital; 
Whereas veterans have higher rates of car-
diovascular disease than nonveterans; 
Whereas female veterans are less likely 
than male veterans to be included in studies 
on the effects of cardiovascular disease on 
veterans; 
Whereas female veterans are less likely 
than male veterans to receive adequate 
treatment for cardiovascular disease; 
Whereas extensive clinical and statistical

(1) high blood pressure; 
(2) high blood cholesterol; 
(3) using tobacco products; 
(4) exposure to tobacco smoke;

agreed to: 
S. RES. 514 
Whereas, on February 15, 2020, Donald 
Stratton, a veteran of World War II and one 
of the last remaining survivors of the attack 
on Pearl Harbor, passed away peacefully sur-
rounded by his loving family in Colorado 
Springs, Colorado; 
Whereas, on December 7, 1941, the attack 
on Pearl Harbor lasted for approximately 5 
hours, during which 2,403 members of the 
United States Armed Forces were killed or 
mortally wounded, 1,247 members of the 
United States Armed Forces were wounded, 
and 57 civilians lost their lives; 
Whereas, during the attack on Pearl Har-
bor, Seaman First Class Donald Stratton was 
one of 6 sailors trapped in the control tower 
main mast after a massive explosion on the 
U.S.S. Arizona; 
Whereas Boatswain’s Mate Second Class

reenlisted in the United States Navy to con-
tinue serving during World War II; 
Whereas, after serving in the United States 
Armed Forces, Donald Stratton committed 
his life to pursuing the posthumous recogni-
tion of Joseph George with the award of a 
Bronze Star; and 
Whereas Donald Stratton exemplified the

of the United States Armed Forces: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors Donald Stratton for his life-
long commitment to service to the United 
States and the example he set for future gen-
erations; and 
(2) remembers the men and women of the 
Greatest Generation of the United States, in-
cluding the few remaining survivors of that 
generation. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor with somber news for 
Colorado and our country. It is about a 
gentleman I have talked about many 
times on this floor and across Colo-
rado—Donald Stratton, a veteran of 
World War II, who was on the USS Ari-
zona on December 7, 1941. Our country 
has suffered a great loss this past week 
with Mr. Stratton’s passing. 
A gallant man, Donald Stratton 
served his country, his family, and our 
great State with honor, pride, and 
courage. He was the type of person who 
only comes around once in a genera-
tion and was someone whom I was 
lucky to have gotten to know and cer-
tainly proud to have worked with. It is 
with great emotion that I come to the 
floor to share his story once again. I 
am sure it will not be the last time, 
but it is certainly the most personal 
time that I have ever shared this story. 
Donald Stratton was born in a tiny 
town in Nebraska—Red Cloud—in 1922. 
Its population today is of 900 or so peo-
ple. I didn’t have a chance to look up 
how big it was when he was born in 
1922. I imagine it may have been a lit-
tle bit bigger. It has certainly faced the 
fate that many rural communities in 
America have. It has seen times of 
growth and times of loss. Certainly, 
the people of Red Cloud know they 
have lost a great hero as well. 
Donald Stratton wrote in his mem-
oirs on December 6, 1941, as a young 
Nebraskan sailor, that he felt like the 
luckiest boy from Red Cloud because 
he was in an incredibly beautiful part 
of the world. In fact, he wrote in his 
memoir that he was in the Navy, see-
ing the world, and was stationed in one 
of the most beautiful parts of the 
world. He was 19, and his entire life 
stretched before him. That next morn-
ing, December 7, 1941, would change 
forever Donald Stratton and his coun-
try. 
In his book, he talked about that 
day, December 7, 1941. A little after 5 
a.m., he had awoken, on his cot, about 
an hour and a half before sunrise. 
He writes: 
I stretched, rubbed the sleep from my eyes, 
and folded up my cot. I stored it in the incin-
erator room, then went below to shower. 
After, I dressed for the day in the typical 
casual clothes that sailors wore on Sun-
days—a clean pair of pressed, white shorts 
and a white T-shirt, along with my sailor’s 
hat. 
A few minutes later, a 5:30 reveille 
sounded over the intercom, and the 
ship stirred to life, he talked about. 
Below decks, men tumbled out of their 
hammocks and headed to the showers. 
A few hours later, at 7:55 that morning, 
after a Sunday morning breakfast, he 
heard airplanes and bombs in the dis-
tance as the attacks on Pearl Harbor 
began. By 8:06—11 minutes later—two- 
thirds of his body would be engulfed in 
flames. 
He was at his station, directing anti- 
aircraft guns, and trying his best to 
fight off the surprise attack by the 
Japanese. At that moment, a 1,700- 
pound 
armor-piercing 
bomb 
was 
dropped from 10,000 feet above the USS 
Arizona. That bomb came crashing 
down through four steel decks, where it 
reached the ammunition magazine, 
causing a series of explosions and 
shooting a fireball 500 to 600 feet in the 
air, engulfing Donald Stratton and his 
shipmates in even more flames. 
That Sunday morning of December 7, 
aboard the USS Arizona, were 1,512 offi-
cers, sailors, and marines. The attack 
that day—that 1,700-pound bomb and so 
many others—killed 1,177. Only 335 
brave people survived that morning. 
Donald Stratton was one of those 335 
sailors. His story of survival happened 
because of a sailor who was stationed 
next to the USS Arizona on a ship 
called the Vestal. He was a sailor by the 
name of Joe George.

February 27, 2020 
On that morning, as they were trying 
to fight back, they had been trapped in 
their tower. Donald Stratton and five 
of his other shipmates were burning— 
trapped on that tower—as the ship was 
going down. Joe George, a sailor 
aboard the Vestal, saw them and saw 
what was happening. He tried many 
times to throw a rope over to the USS 
Arizona to provide help. Finally, he 
succeeded. Out of the smoke and out of 
the flames, a lifeline from Joe George 
to that tower was seen, and they were 
able to affix it to the tower. Miracu-
lously, Donald Stratton and these 
other sailors were able to shimmy 
across the rope, over the burning 
water, to safety on the Vestal. Despite 
their terrible wounds, they made it to 
the Vestal. 
This story led to an incredible fight 
again by Donald Stratton. After he 
spent a year recovering from the burns 
that were over almost all of his body, 
he told his parents that he couldn’t 
just abandon the fight, that he couldn’t 
abandon his country, that he had to go 
back to duty. With that, he went back 
into service for his country. But the 
fight Donald Stratton gave for this 
country and for his fellow sailors didn’t 
stop there. After he served in the Navy, 
after he left it, he knew he had to 
spend the rest of his life fighting for 
the man who saved his life and his fel-
low shipmates. 
It wasn’t like people left the ship at 
the end of the day on December 7 to go 
back to the office and fill out reports 
and say: Well, it was a busy day at the 
office. These things happen. 
America was at war. Thousands of 
lives had been lost. In the fire, in the 
smoke, and in the fight, what Joe 
George had done for Donald Stratton 
and those other brave sailors was lost 
for that time. Donald Stratton went 
back into service. He went back into 
the fight. He spent the rest of his life 
trying to find the man who saved his 
life. He spent a decade-plus looking for 
Joe George, finding out who he was. 
After he found out who he was, he 
spent 16 years fighting the Navy so 
that Joe George would be recognized 
for his heroic actions. 
Donald Stratton went to the Arizona 
Legislature, and he went to the Colo-
rado Legislature. They passed resolu-
tions asking that Joe George be recog-
nized for his acts of bravery and his 
courage. 
He then came to this Congress. 
Lauren Bruner, Donald Stratton, and 
the other members who survived the 
USS Arizona—the remaining few of the 
USS Arizona—came to the Senate and 
said: As fewer and fewer of us are able 
to celebrate and to commemorate De-
cember 7 each and every year, would 
you please celebrate one more life—Joe 
George’s? On December 7, 2017, the 
Navy recognized Joe George with the 
Bronze Star and the ‘‘V’’ for valor de-
vice. 
I have a picture of Donald Stratton 
as he said goodbye one more time to 
his fellow shipmates on December 7, 
2017. He thanked Joe George for saving 
his life and probably never fully under-
stood why his mission didn’t end that 
day while so many others’ missions 
did, but thank God he was able to con-
tinue the fight for this country. 
While Donald Stratton was on the 
brink of death, he knew he had to get 
back into the fight, and he did. He 
went back into the Pacific theater. 
He wrote in his book: 
Though I may have left Pearl Harbor on a 
stretcher, I had returned on a destroyer. I 
had recovered my strength, as had my coun-
try. I was ready to meet what was coming, 
and I had a boatload of reinforcements with 
me. 
Donald Stratton came back, fighting 
for our country and fighting for the 
man who saved his life. 
He wrote in his memoir that, in life, 
the only question that matters is 
‘‘Have I lived a good life?’’ He wrote 
that he wonders if he will be remem-
bered when he is gone. He wonders who 
will remember him and why. 
Please know that we will remember 
you eternally and your family for what 
you have done for this country. 
I introduce a resolution to recognize 
and remember Donald Stratton’s life 
because there are only a few remaining 
brave men and women who survived 
that day, who survived that war, who 
fought for us so many years ago. I hope 
all of my colleagues will support it so 
that this American hero and his incred-
ible life can be remembered by our Na-
tion forever. 
The first time I met Donald Stratton, 
he told me his story. He told me what 
he had done. He told me how he and his 
wife had met and how he had gone back 
into the fight after receiving such se-
vere burns that his wife used to take a 
bristle brush to them to help his skin 
feel better. 
I asked how he did it and said: Mr. 
Stratton, I am pretty sure I never 
could have done what you did. 
In his kind of ‘‘ah, shucks’’ demeanor 
from Red Cloud, NE, he said: ‘‘Well, 
Cory, everyone has to be somewhere.’’ 
It was not the response I thought I 
was going to get, but everybody does 
have to be somewhere. Thank God Don-
ald Stratton was on that boat on De-
cember 7, 1941. Thank God Joe George 
was on that boat on December 7, 1941. 
Thank God that rope was thrown over 
to the tower to save his life. Thank 
God Donald Stratton returned to the 
fight to stand up for this country, to 
continue his fight for Joe George, and 
to have an incredible family who con-
tinues to share in his legacy today. 
Thank God for all of them. Thank 
God for all of the men and women who 
were there that day and what they 
have been able to do to fight for this 
country, to stand for this country, to 
pay back the blessings of this country 
as we must fight each and every day to 
pay back the blessings they so gener-
ously bestowed upon this Nation when 
they stood up, because they were there. 
We know that Donald Stratton has 
joined his fellow shipmates. That rev-
eille at the Pearly Gates must be quite 
spectacular. He passed away at his 
home in Colorado Springs on February 
15, at the age of 97, next to his beloved 
wife. He joins Lauren Bruner, another 
survivor of that morning on the USS 
Arizona, who came to my office to fight 
with him for Joe George—Bruner, a 
shipmate who passed away on Sep-
tember 10 of last year and who was in-
terred in the USS Arizona this past De-
cember 7 on the 78th anniversary of the 
Pearl Harbor attack. I pray that they 
all rest in peace as they join their fam-
ily in arms. 
This Saturday, the community of 
Colorado Springs and our State will 
hold a memorial service for Donald 
Stratton when he will be lain in his 
final resting place next to his daugh-
ters in Nebraska. As we say goodbye to 
this hero, let us all do it with thanks 
to Donald Stratton and to the two re-
maining survivors of the USS Arizona 
today, Lou Conter and Ken Potts. 
To every brave man and woman who 
serves our country, we are eternally 
grateful. 
I am going to miss him.

other career fields that are vital in keeping 
the United States competitive in the global 
economy; 
Whereas CTE helps the United States meet 
the very real and immediate challenges of 
economic 
development, 
student 
achieve-
ment, and global competitiveness; 
Whereas the United States has 30,000,000 
jobs with an average income of $55,000 per 
year that do not require a bachelor’s degree 
yet increasingly require some level of post-
secondary education; 
Whereas over 11,800,000 students are en-
rolled in CTE across the country at sec-
ondary and postsecondary institutions, with 
CTE programs in thousands of CTE centers, 
comprehensive high schools, career acad-
emies, and CTE high schools, and nearly 
1,000 2-year colleges; 
Whereas CTE matches employability skills 
with workforce demand and provides rel-
evant academic and technical coursework 
leading to industry-recognized credentials 
for secondary, postsecondary, and adult 
learners; 
Whereas CTE affords students the oppor-
tunity to gain the knowledge, skills, and cre-
dentials needed to secure careers in growing, 
high-demand fields; 
Whereas secondary CTE is associated with 
a lower probability of dropping out of high 
school and a higher likelihood of graduating 
on-time; 
Whereas CTE students were significantly 
more likely than non-CTE students to report 
having developed problem-solving, project 
completion, research, math, college applica-
tion, work-related, communication, time 
management, and critical thinking skills 
during high school; 
Whereas, according to an American Fed-
eration of Teachers poll, 94 percent of par-
ents approve of expanding access to CTE and 
other programs that prepare students for 
jobs; 
Whereas students at schools with highly 
integrated rigorous academic and CTE pro-
grams are significantly more likely to meet 
college and career readiness benchmarks 
than students at schools with less integrated 
programs; 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress affirmed the im-
portance of CTE by passing the Strength-
ening Career and Technical Education for 
the 21st Century Act (Public Law 115–224), 
which supports program improvement in sec-

ruary 23, 1917 (commonly known as the 
‘‘Smith-Hughes Vocational Education Act of 
1917’’) (39 Stat. 929, chapter 114), which was 
the first major Federal investment in sec-
ondary CTE and laid the foundation for the 
bipartisan, bicameral support for CTE that 
continues as of February 2020: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates February 2020 as ‘‘Career and 
Technical Education Month’’ to celebrate ca-
reer and technical education across the 
United States; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Career 
and Technical Education Month; 
(3) recognizes the importance of career and 
technical education in preparing a well-edu-
cated and skilled workforce in the United

resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 516 
Whereas, in 1776, people envisioned the 
United States as a new nation dedicated to 
the proposition stated in the Declaration of 
Independence that ‘‘all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their Cre-
ator with certain unalienable Rights, that 
among these are Life, Liberty and the pur-
suit of Happiness’’; 
Whereas Africans were first brought invol-
untarily to the shores of the United States 
as early as the 17th century; 
Whereas African Americans suffered en-
slavement and subsequently faced the injus-
tices of lynch mobs, segregation, and denial 
of the basic and fundamental rights of citi-
zenship; 
Whereas, in 2020, the vestiges of those in-
justices and inequalities remain evident in 
the society of the United States; 
Whereas, in the face of injustices, people of 
good will and of all races in the United 
States have distinguished themselves with a 
commitment to the noble ideals on which 
the United States was founded and have 
fought courageously for the rights and free-
dom of African Americans and others; 
Whereas African Americans, such as Lieu-
tenant Colonel Allen Allensworth, Maya 
Angelou, Arthur Ashe, Jr., James Baldwin, 
James Beckwourth, Clara Brown, Blanche 
Bruce, Ralph Bunche, Shirley Chisholm, Holt 
Collier, Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Larry

worked against racism to achieve success 
and to make significant contributions to the 
economic, educational, political, artistic, 
athletic, literary, scientific, and techno-
logical advancement of the United States; 
Whereas 
the 
contributions 
of 
African 
Americans from all walks of life throughout 
the history of the United States reflect the 
greatness of the United States; 
Whereas many African Americans lived, 
toiled, and died in obscurity, never achieving 
the recognition those individuals deserved, 
and yet paved the way for future generations 
to succeed; 
Whereas African Americans continue to 
serve the United States at the highest levels 
of business, government, and the military; 
Whereas the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln 
and Frederick Douglass inspired the creation 
of Negro History Week, the precursor to 
Black History Month; 
Whereas Negro History Week represented 
the culmination of the efforts of Dr. Carter 
G. Woodson, the ‘‘Father of Black History’’, 
to enhance knowledge of Black history 
through The Journal of Negro History, pub-
lished by the Association for the Study of 
African American Life and History, which 
was founded by Dr. Carter G. Woodson and 
Jesse E. Moorland; 
Whereas Black History Month, celebrated 
during the month of February, originated in 
1926 when Dr. Carter G. Woodson set aside a 
special period in February to recognize the 
heritage and achievements of Black people 
in the United States; 
Whereas Dr. Carter G. Woodson stated, 
‘‘We have a wonderful history behind us. . . 
. If you are unable to demonstrate to the 
world that you have this record, the world 
will say to you, ‘You are not worthy to enjoy 
the blessings of democracy or anything 
else.’ ’’; 
Whereas, since its founding, the United 
States has imperfectly progressed toward 
noble goals; 
Whereas the history of the United States is 
the story of people regularly affirming high 
ideals, striving to reach those ideals but 
often failing, and then struggling to come to 
terms with the disappointment of that fail-
ure, before committing to try again; 
Whereas, on November 4, 2008, the people of 
the United States elected Barack Obama, an 
African-American man, as President of the 
United States; and 
Whereas, on February 22, 2012, people

United States are the recipients of the 
wealth of history provided by Black culture; 
(2) recognizes the importance of Black His-

the complex history of the United States, 
while remaining hopeful and confident about 
the path ahead;

Whereas Petros Mavromichalis, the former 
Commander in Chief of Greece and a founder 
of the modern Greek state, said to the citi-

and . . . in imitating you, we shall imitate 
our ancestors and be thought worthy of them 
if we succeed in resembling you.’’;

and delaying the attack on Russia;

the Greeks, we do not know which the out-
come of World War II would have been’’ and

heroes, but that heroes fight like Greeks’’;

ple of Greece were killed during World War 
II; 
Whereas Greece consistently allied with 
the United States in major international 
conflicts throughout its history as a modern

the region;

Whereas Greece received worldwide praise 
for its extraordinary handling during the 
2004 Olympic Games of more than 14,000 ath-
letes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and

ple of Greece handled efficiently, securely, 
and with hospitality; 
Whereas the Governments and people of 
Greece and the United States are at the fore-
front of efforts to advance freedom, democ-
racy, peace, stability, and human rights;

have forged a close bond between the peoples 
of Greece and the United States; and 
Whereas it is proper and desirable for the 
United States to celebrate March 25, 2020, 
Greek Independence Day, with the people of 
Greece and to reaffirm the democratic prin-
ciples from which those two great countries 
were founded: Now, therefore, be it

HONORING CARLOS A. PENIN FOR 
HIS 
DEDICATION 
TO 
SOUTH 
FLORIDA 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, in rec-
ognition of his long-standing contributions to 
the engineering profession and his dedication 
to bettering South Florida, I rise today to 
honor my good friend, Mr. Carlos A. Penin. 
Born in Holguin, Cuba, Carlos was forced 
into exile by the Castro dictatorship with his 
mother and three sisters in 1962. They arrived 
in Miami, Florida where they rebuilt their lives 
in pursuit of the American Dream. Carlos 
knew that with hard work and perseverance, 
he could turn this dream into a reality. In 
1977, he graduated from the University of 
Florida with a B.S. in Civil Engineering and 
Construction Management. He continued with 
his studies and received an M.S. in Environ-
mental and Urban Systems from Florida Inter-
national University in 1982. 
After graduation, Carlos remained in South 
Florida and worked for several architectural 
and engineering firms. He played a key role in 
designing and managing major infrastructure 
projects, including the Joe Robbie Stadium, 
now known as the Hard Rock Stadium. De-
spite his success, Carlos always knew he 
wanted to start his own company and give 
back to the community that has given so much 
to him. In 1989, he took a chance and began 
C.A.P. Government, Inc. (CAP), and, in 2019, 
CAP celebrated its thirtieth anniversary. Under 
his leadership, CAP has provided unparalleled 
expertise for government clients who need as-
sistance with building department services. 
Presently, they serve over sixty municipalities 
and six educational institutions across Florida. 
While Carlos’s professional accomplish-
ments are impressive, it would be remiss to 
honor him without touching on the love he has 
for his three daughters, Monica, Teresa, and 
Isabel. His daughters are truly his greatest 
treasures, and, with their support, he has be-
come not only a successful businessman, but 
also a leader in his community. He has been 
actively involved in promoting the importance 
of engineering careers through leadership po-
sitions in several organizations. He currently 
serves on the Board of Directors for the 
Cuban American Association of Civil Engi-
neers (CAACE), and, in fact, is the 2020 re-
cipient of their Plinio Villanueva Award. This 
award recognizes his commitment and dedica-
tion to advancing the civil engineering profes-
sion. Further, it acknowledges the difference 
that he has made in the lives of so many, and 
it is one that he greatly deserves. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to call Mr. 
Carlos A. Penin a close friend, and to pay trib-
ute to his impressive accomplishments. I ask 
my fellow colleagues to join me in recognizing 
this remarkable individual. 
RECOGNIZING CLAY COUNTY SU-
PERVISOR, 
MR. 
SHELTON 
DEANES 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Clay County Super-
visor, Mr. Shelton Deanes, who is being in-
ducted into the West Point Hall of Fame for 
his outstanding public service. 
Supervisor Deanes was born in West Point, 
Mississippi, in 1956. He and his wife, Mrs. 
Frances Deanes, are blessed with eight chil-
dren, nine grandchildren, and four great- 
grandchildren. Supervisor Deanes has always 
set an example of faith for his family to follow. 
He has been a proud member of Palo Alto 
Missionary Baptist Church for over 54 years 
and has served his congregation as a Deacon. 
Supervisor Deanes was first elected as Clay 
County Supervisor in 1991. During his 29-year 
career, he has been instrumental in devel-
oping multiple projects for Clay County. His 
initiatives included building the Judicial Court 
Building, adding more voting precincts to the 
county, developing the Una Community Cen-
ter, adding the walking trail and Fun Day, and 
paving residential roads. 
Supervisor Deanes is a remarkable Mis-
sissippian who has set a shining example for 
others to follow. I thank him for his positive im-
pact on his community, and I wish him many 
more years of good health.

IN RECOGNITION OF DONALD 
POLLARD 
HON. LAUREN UNDERWOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Donald W. Pollard, III for his 
service in my office in Washington, D.C. 
Donald joined our office as a legislative as-
sistant and served as an advisor for my work 
on the House Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity, in addition to handling a policy portfolio 
that included energy, environment, natural re-
sources, judiciary, campaign finance, and 
other issues. Among other accomplishments, 
he developed and led introduction of the Cli-
mate and Health Protection Act and the Safe 
Communities Act. Donald was instrumental in 
our office’s work to advance clean energy pol-
icy, 
protect 
communities 
from 
domestic 
threats, and counter gun violence. 
Donald’s intellect, diligence, and profes-
sionalism have been invaluable assets as we 
worked to establish our legislative operation 
from scratch during my first year in office. I 
commend his ability to direct a wide policy 
portfolio while leading my staff work on the 
Committee on Homeland Security. Although 
Donald may be leaving our office, our commu-
nity in northern Illinois will continue to benefit 
from the results of his hard work and accom-
plishments. 
Prior to joining my staff, Donald earned a 
Bachelor of Arts from the University of Rich-
mond. He then earned a Master of Public Ad-
ministration from American University while 
serving his home-state Senator. I am grateful 
he chose to continue his career in public serv-
ice by joining my office. Our team will miss his 
expertise, work ethic, sense of humor, and en-
cyclopedic knowledge of Beyonce´. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to formally 
thank Donald W. Pollard, III for his service to 
my office, to Illinois’s 14th Congressional Dis-
trict, and to our country.

RECOGNIZING THE 28TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE KHOJALY MAS-
SACRE 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this week 
marks the 28th anniversary of the massacre of 
hundreds of people in the town of Khojaly in 
what was the largest killing of ethnic Azer-
baijani civilians in the course of the Armenia- 
Azerbaijan conflict. Khojaly, which is located in 
the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, 
was once home to 7,000 people. Tragically, 
on February 26, 1992, Armenian armed forces 
massacred over 600 unarmed people—includ-
ing 106 women and 83 children—and left less 
than 2,000 survivors. Hundreds more became 
disabled due to their injuries. More than one 
hundred children lost a parent and 25 children 
lost both parents. At least 8 families were 
completely killed. 
Even though a ceasefire went into effect 
over two decades ago, more than 20 percent 
of Azerbaijan’s territory, including Nagorno- 
Karabakh and seven surrounding districts, re-
main occupied and more than 1 million 
Azerbaijanis remain unable to return to their 
home villages. Ongoing violence along the line 
of contact surrounding occupied Azerbaijani 
territory emphasizes the urgency of robust 
American participation in the Organization for 
Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) 
Minsk Group as it works toward a peaceful 
resolution of the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict. 
Azerbaijan has been a strong partner of the 
United States and its allies. This cooperation 
has included: playing a leadership role in non-
proliferation issues; providing troops to serve 
shoulder-to-shoulder 
with 
U.S. 
forces 
in 
Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan; allowing transit 
of non-lethal equipment used by coalition 
forces through Azerbaijan to Afghanistan; con-
struction of the Southern Gas Corridor from 
the Caspian Sea to Italy, thereby providing 
Europe with an alternative to Russian energy 
sources; and supplying 40 percent of Israel’s 
oil. Azerbaijan also has a thriving Jewish com-
munity and has outstanding relations with 
Israel.

REMEMBERING THE KHOJALY 
MASSACRE 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
remembrance of the Khojaly Massacre, and to 
honor the victims of this horrendous act. 
The appalling massacre perpetrated on the 
innocent people of Khojaly in February 1992 is 
no less shocking 28 years later. One of the 
worst atrocities ever committed in the South 
Caucasus, justice has still not been delivered 
and 150 civilians are still missing. 
As we demand respect for human rights and 
democratic accountability within the inter-
national community, it is important that we 
continue to remember what happened in 
Khojaly and bring those responsible to ac-
count.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DONALD 
G. STRATTON 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Mr. Donald G. Stratton, 
who passed away on February 15, 2020 after 
a lifetime of service to his country. Mr. Stratton 
was a dedicated husband of 69 years, a fa-
ther, grandfather, great-grandfather, New York 
Times best-selling author, USS Arizona Sur-
vivor, and a champion of the memory for 
those who did not make it home. 
Mr. Donald Stratton was born July 14, 1922 
in Inavale, Nebraska to Robert and Jessie 
Stratton. After growing up in Nebraska and 
graduating from Red Cloud High School, Don-
ald attended Navy bootcamp in 1940. After 
graduation from bootcamp he was given or-
ders to join the USS Arizona in dry dock at the 
Navy shipyards in Bremerton, Washington. 
Upon completion of her maintenance and ret-
rofit in Washington, the USS Arizona steamed 
across the Pacific to join her fleet in Pearl 
Harbor, Hawaii in early 1941. 
On the morning of December 7, 1941, Sea-
man First Class Stratton was on his way to 
visit a shipmate in sick bay when the Japa-
nese attack on Pearl Harbor began. He imme-
diately raced to his battle station, winding 
through ship spaces and climbing three lad-
ders to reach the Arizona’s sky control plat-
form, where he yelled coordinates to the gun 
crews firing at the incoming waves of Japa-
nese bombers. Just minutes after he arrived, 
a bomb struck a direct blow to the Arizona hit-
ting the ammunition stores, lifting the 35,000 
ton ship out of the water, and sending a fire-
ball hundreds of feet skyward. 
Seaman First Class Stratton and his ship-
mates in the director were surrounded by 
flames. He and five other sailors were able to 
navigate the burning wreckage and signal for 
help. Boatswain’s Mate Second Class Joe 
George from the USS Vestal came to their 
rescue and saved their lives by repeatedly 
throwing a heaving line until the men were 
able to secure it and climb seventy feet, hand 
over hand, to safety above the inferno that 
raged below. 
Boatswain’s 
Mate 
Second 
Class 
Joe 
George disobeyed a direct order to cut away 
from the Arizona and instead courageously 
fought to provide a means of escape for the 
sailors. Mr. Stratton credited Joe George for 
saving his life that day and petitioned for years 
to have his actions recognized. Mr. Stratton 
called and wrote numerous letters, ultimately 
meeting with President Trump before Joe 
George was awarded the Bronze Star with ‘‘V’’ 
Device for his heroic actions that day. 
Mr. Stratton was medically discharged from 
the Navy in 1942 and returned to Nebraska. 
Ever the fighter, he decided to reenlist a year 
later, deny orders to a stateside posting, and 
eventually joined the USS Stack on its way to 
the Pacific. He fought in the invasion of the 
Philippines, the invasion of Okinawa, and on 
patrol missions throughout the Pacific theater. 
After returning from war, Donald Stratton 
traveled the world, raised a family, and de-
voted his life to preserving the story of what 
happened that day. Donald is survived by his 
wife of 69 years Velma, son Randy (Kathy) 
Stratton, brother Willie Stratton, grandchildren, 
and great-grandchildren. 
Mr. Stratton was a hero. A selfless Amer-
ican who dedicated his life to our country and 
fought to have his shipmates remembered 
long after they, or he, had passed to another 
life. It was a privilege to have met Mr. Stratton 
and it is an honor to stand and commemorate 
his incredible and full life.

HONORING MR. FULTON W. 
WALKER 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Fulton W. Walker, a 
three-year World War II Veteran of the United 
States Army. On February 28, 2020, Mr. Ful-
ton W. Walker will be recognized for his serv-
ice and commitment to the United States and 
presented with his service medals. 
Mr. Walker, of Emerson and Texarkana and 
resident of the Fourth District of Arkansas, 
began his service during World War II in 1943 
at Fort Knox, Kentucky where he trained as 
part of a tank battalion. He later transferred to 
Fort Campbell, Kentucky as a member of a 
transportation outfit where he learned how to 
drive military trucks to haul supplies. 
In July 1944, he deployed overseas to the 
European Theater of Operations where he 
served in England, France, Germany and 
wherever service needs required. He worked 
tirelessly as a truck driver transporting sup-
plies from coastal docks to the frontlines, all 
during the darkness of night to avoid enemy 
detection. 
At the end of the war, he returned home to 
Arkansas and re-entered the Arkansas Agri-
cultural, Mechanical and Normal College 
(AM&N), now the University of Arkansas at 
Pine Bluff (UAPB). He graduated with a Bach-
elor of Science degree in Economics and 
English in May 1950. He then moved on to 
graduate school earning a Master’s in Edu-
cation Administration from the University of Ar-
kansas at Fayetteville in 1957. 
He then served in several different capac-
ities including as an English teacher and high 
school basketball coach in Rison, Arkansas. In 
1952, he accepted a teaching position in the 
grade 1–12 school in Star City, Arkansas and 
two years later became principal, serving in 
this position until 1965. The Pine Bluff School 
District hired him into his next assignment 
where he served as elementary school prin-
cipal, middle school principal, district central 
office federal title I program coordinator and fi-
nally assistant superintendent in charge of all 
federal programs for the Pine Bluff School Dis-
trict. 
Mr. 
Walker 
mentored 
many 
students 
throughout his 36-year career and served as a 
role model to all he interacted with. His faithful 
service to students in Southeast Arkansas is a 
testament to his military service in putting oth-
ers before self. 
I am honored to recognize Mr. Fulton W. 
Walker and all African American veterans of 
World War II for their rich history of service 
and bravery. I thank each and every one of 
them for protecting the freedoms of this coun-
try, and hope their legacy continues for gen-
erations to come.

HONORING PAM WILLIAMS AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Pam Williams, the Director of 
the Isiserettes Drill and Drum Corps in Des 
Moines, as the Iowan of the Week. As the 
Isiserettes celebrate their 40th anniversary this 
year, I know this longstanding community pro-
gram relies on the contributions and dedica-
tion of Ms. Williams to the Isiserettes Drill and 
Drum Corps. 
Ms. Williams, or Ms. Pam as her students 
call her, co-founded the Isiserettes in 1980, a 
time when there weren’t many creative outlets 
for young African American kids in Iowa. Since 
then, the Isiserettes have become an icon in 
the Des Moines Metro, with performances at 
the Iowa State Fair, parades all over the city, 
and even music videos with local musicians. 
They also perform nationally, hold several ti-
tles and have earned the honor of performing 
in both of President Obama’s Inaugural Pa-
rades. We are deeply proud to see them rep-
resenting Iowa as they travel across this coun-
try. 
Even at the age of 75, Ms. Pam never 
misses a rehearsal. You can always find her 
working hard on choreography and helping 
students reach the high expectations she’s set 
for them. Students between 7 and 18 years 
old dedicate themselves to early morning 
practices on hot summer days, and must 
maintain good grades in order to participate. 
As a result, they boast a 91 percent gradua-
tion rate amongst members of their team. Ms. 
Pam’s students describe her as one of the

strictest people they know, but they will also 
tell you she is like a second mother to them. 
The key to the Isiserettes’ success is the fam-
ily atmosphere fostered by Ms. Pam and her 
team. 
It 
should 
not 
go 
without 
notice 
that 
Isiserettes Drill and Drum Corps is a volun-
teer-led organization. Ms. Pam does not re-
ceive a single dime for the thousands of hours 
she puts into the organization every year. She 
does it out of the goodness of her heart, the 
benefits to our community, and her commit-
ment to the success of her students. Ms. Pam 
has built the tradition, pride, and dedication 
that has sustained the Isiserettes for 40 years. 
It is Ms. Pam’s dedication to providing a 
safe place for students to express themselves 
through music and dance that makes her a pil-
lar of our community. It is an honor to com-
memorate Ms. Pam and recognize her as the 
Iowan of the Week.

RECOGNIZING THE CENTRALIA 
COMPETITIVE DANCE TEAM 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Centralia High School Competi-
tive Dance Team for its first-place finish in the 
2020 Class 1A Illinois state dance competition. 
After the first day of competition, Centralia 
found itself in third place. By the thrilling con-
clusion of the event the next day, though, 
Centralia was hoisting the championship tro-
phy. 
Centralia finished with 97.18 points, beating 
its nearest competitor by nearly a full point. 
The score would have been high enough to 
top Class 2A, as well. Teams are evaluated in 
categories such as choreography, difficulty of 
the music, technique, synchronization, staging, 
spacing, and showmanship. 
Centralia’s victory is a testament to great 
coaching, hard work, skill, and raw nerve. The 
squad is coached by Bethany Lorenzini. Team 
members include Jestin Taylor, Andrew John-
son, Ali Moreno, Gracie Moore, Elijah Jones, 
Erica Burnett, Clara Peroo, Alyssa Smith, 
Katelyn Parker, William Collins, Destiny Wal-
lace, Reed Mays, Kailynn Witherspoon, Cash 
Berry, Zoe White, and Sophia Schossler. Man-
agers are Diamond Battle and Ece Polat. 
The state championship is the first in any 
IHSA competition for Centralia since it claimed 
the Scholastic Bowl during the 1990–91 
school year. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure I 
stand to recognize the Centralia Competitive 
Dance Team and offer it my sincere congratu-
lations on being state champion. I wish the 
team all the best in the future.

IN HONOR OF EL AMOR M. 
BRAWNE ALI 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor and privilege 
to recognize a dedicated public servant who 
continues to make our community proud as a 
Ward Leader. As public officials, entrusted by 
their peers to oversee elections and party ac-
tivity, Philadelphia Ward Leaders represent a 
corps of unsung heroes that help facilitate the 
progress that molds our city. I am honored to 
be joined by one of our most distinguished, 
esteemed Ward Leaders today, and in com-
memoration of Black History Month, ensure 
that their contributions to our city remain en-
shrined in our historical record for generations 
to recognize. 
Black History Month is more than a mere 
byline on the month of February, it is an op-
portunity to celebrate and recognize the ex-
traordinary contributions that the African Amer-
ican community has made, and continues to 
make, on our nation’s history and culture. And 
I can think of no honoree more deserving of 
this recognition, who embodies the selfless 
commitment to their neighbors and peers, than 
Ms. El. 
El Amor M. Brawne Ali, of Ward 37, has 
also taken it upon herself to invest in our city’s 
youth. Beyond her work for local candidates 
and elections, she has undertaken projects 
that will provide structured activity to keep kids 
involved after school. This manifests itself in 
many ways, one of which is through her ef-
forts to revitalize Fotterall Square Park. What 
used to be a vibrant gathering place has since 
devolved to abandoned fields and neglected 
playgrounds, but with El Amor’s leadership, 
Fotterall is back on track to reach its full po-
tential. The impact of her efforts will transform 
the neighborhood for these kids, their kids, 
and generations to follow. I thank Ms. El. 
Taking after the long lineage of Philadel-
phians who have helped sculpt our democracy 
into an increasingly inclusive system that en-
courages public participation, Ms. El has left 
her own mark on our city. I look forward to 
years of collaboration so we can create a 
more 
inclusive, 
representative 
democracy 
throughout our community. 
HONORING THE PASADENA HOST 
LIONS CLUB’S CENTENNIAL AN-
NIVERSARY 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Pasadena Host Lions Club upon 
its centennial anniversary. 
Lions Club International began in 1917 with 
a mission to encourage volunteers to serve 
their communities, promote peace and inter-
national understanding, and improve the world 
with kindness by meeting humanitarian needs. 
Currently, Lions Club International has 1.4 mil-
lion members in forty-seven thousand Lions 
Clubs. As the fifth Lions Club in the state of 
California, the Pasadena Host Lions Club was 
chartered on March 26, 1920. 
For 100 years, Pasadena Host Lions Club 
members have provided innumerable hours of 
dedicated service toward the improvement of 
the Pasadena community, with an emphasis 
on persons with disabilities, seniors, youth and 
the homeless. Helen Keller referred to Lions 
Clubs as the ‘‘Knights of the Blind,’’ for their 
support of organizations that serve those im-
paired in sight. This is seen through Pasadena 
Host Lions Club supporting White Cane Safety 
Day—providing Lions the opportunity to raise 
awareness on safe navigation of the visually 
impaired, support of other local groups for the 
visually impaired, assisting the founding of 
Lions Eye Foundation of Southern California, 
and creating the Pasadena Lions Memorial 
Trust for the welfare of persons with disabil-
ities and children. 
Other organizations the club supports in-
clude the Aspen Camp of the Deaf and Hard 
of Hearing, Pasadena Police Foundation, 
American Red Cross, Pasadena Senior Cen-
ter, City of Hope, Union Station Homeless 
Services, Pasadena Jaycees, Young and 
Healthy, Pasadena YMCA and the Salvation 
Army. 
In addition, the club provides youth scholar-
ships, and currently has six charter LEO Clubs 
for youth that focus on leadership, experience, 
opportunity and service. 
Pasadena Host Lions Club members have 
faithfully served the greater Pasadena area for 
one hundred years. I ask all Members to join 
with me in commending the Pasadena Host 
Lions Club on their celebration of hundred 
years of service.

the last 16 years and substantially contributed

man, Edwin rose through the ranks and be-
came a Lieutenant by 1986, then a Captain 
the following year. His service did not dis-
appoint 
because 
by 
the 
mid-1990s, 
he 
oversaw critical operations for the Department. 
Soon enough, Edwin found himself leading the 
Fire Department as their new Chief by 2004. 
As Fire Chief, he exceptionally performed 
his duties and gained a reputation for his ef-
fective management capacity. He secured mil-
lions in grant funding and amazingly acquired 
more responsibilities for the Department. The 
increased responsibilities expanded the force 
and augmented operational capacity. The re-
sponsibilities included expansion in emergency 
medical services and even water rescue serv-
ices. With Edwin at the helm for 16 years, he 
understood the value of camaraderie and his 
distinguished service is worthy of veneration. 
His love for firefighting and passion for serving 
his community should be admired by all of us. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, join me to rec-
ognize Chief Allen’s service to the First District 
and to the Commonwealth. His dedication to 
the Fire Department exemplifies the type of 
leadership that our great Nation demands. Let 
us wish Edwin the best during his retirement, 
as his rest is well deserved. On behalf of the 
First District, we say thank you.

IN HONOR OF DR. WALTER 
‘‘WALLY’’ WILKERSON 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and honor Dr. Walter ‘‘Wally’’ 
Wilkerson’s service to the community as a 
physician, community leader, and as Chair-
man of the Montgomery County Republican 
Party for fifty-six years. 
Born and raised in Bryan, Texas, Dr. 
Wilkerson stayed close to home and earned a 
Bachelor’s Degree in biology from Texas A&M 
University in 1951. After graduation, Dr. 
Wilkerson pursued a Medical Degree from the 
prestigious University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical School in 1955. Just one year after 
finishing medical school, Dr. Wilkerson joined 
the United States Navy and spent two years 
as a General Medical Officer. While stationed 
at Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego, 
California, Dr. Wilkerson served aboard the 
USS Hooper Island. In the summer of 1958, 
Dr. Wilkerson participated in the historic atom-
ic weapon test operation known as Operation 
Hardtack at Eniwetok Atoll in the southwest 
Pacific Ocean. 
When it was time to return to civilian life, he 
found his way back to home to Texas and 
joined his family in Conroe. After encourage-
ment from his father, he introduced himself to 
a local family medical practitioner, Dr. Deane 
Sadler. After shadowing Dr. Sadler for a day, 
a simple handshake sealed the deal and Dr. 
Wilkerson joined his clinic. Over the years, Dr. 
Sadler, became not only a business partner, 
but a mentor and a friend. 
Eager to get involved in the community, Dr. 
Wilkerson entered the Conroe political scene 
while working at Sadler Clinic. In 1964, he ran 
successfully for Chairman of the Montgomery 
County Republican Party. The following years 
of leadership and devoted service to the com-
munity earned him the nickname ‘‘King Wally.’’ 
Dr. Wilkerson has received several accolades 
for his effective leadership, vision, and hard 
work, has been selected as a delegate for 
multiple Republican National Conventions, and 
continues to be active in the Associated Re-
publicans of Texas. In 1989, Governor William 
P. Clements appointed Dr. Wilkerson as a 
member of the San Jacinto River Authority 
Board. In 1995, Governor George W. Bush se-
lected Dr. Wilkerson to Chair the Texas Board 
of Health. 
In 1996, Dr. Wilkerson retired from family 
medicine after thirty-eight years of service and 
dedication to his community. Today, he relin-
quishes the helm as Chairman of the Mont-
gomery 
County 
Republican 
Patty. 
Dr. 
Wilkerson is respected by many and has been 
a faithful friend and source of professional 
guidance to many. We are thankful he chose 
to make a lasting difference right here in our 
community. Our entire community has been 
inspired by your character, integrity, patience, 
fairness and optimism. Your principles of free-
dom and limited government enhance the lives 
and opportunity for the people we seek to 
serve. 
I join the communities of Conroe and Mont-
gomery County in thanking Dr. Wilkerson, and 
I am proud to join him and his wife Neddie 
Jane in celebrating this amazing milestone of 
service and leadership for fifty-six successful 
years.

Arthur Green, who proudly served our na-
tion’s Navy before taking over the helm of 
Ward 14, oversees a smooth electoral oper-
ation, but also is a dedicated advocate on be-
half of his constituents. Instrumental in the for-
mulation of the 14th Ward Registered Commu-
nity Organization, Arthur has made it a priority 
to ensure that as the East Poplar area con-
tinues its developmental boom, residents will 
reap the benefits while avoiding gentrification- 
induced displacement. His efforts will bolster 
quality of life for those who live in Ward 14 
and serve as a model for our entire city as it 
struggles with gentrification. I am grateful to 
have Arthur on the frontlines of this fight, and 
I thank him for his work on behalf of Ward 14. 
I thank Arthur for his service. 
Taking after the long lineage of Philadel-
phians who have helped sculpt our democracy 
into an increasingly inclusive system that en-
courages public participation, Arthur Green 
has left his own mark on our city. I look for-
ward to years of collaboration so we can cre-
ate a more inclusive, representative democ-
racy throughout our community.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Edward (Ed) William Leal 
as he celebrates his 100th birthday. Ed is a 
longtime resident of Concord and a former 
public servant for Contra Costa County. 
Ed was born in Oakland, California in Feb-
ruary 1920. His family lived in Oakley where 
his father was a butcher and ran a local gro-
cery store. Ed attended Antioch High School 
where he played varsity football, basketball, 
tennis, and track and field. He set numerous 
records, including one for pole-vaulting that 
stood for 27 years. While at Antioch High 
School, Ed also met his future wife, Wilma. 
Ed went on to study at the University of 
California, Berkeley where he was a member 
of the track and field team. However, Ed’s col-
legiate career was interrupted when he de-
cided to enlist in the United States Army Air 
Corps during World War II. He was stationed 
in North Africa as a member of the 49th Fight-
er Squadron. Before being deployed, Ed and 
Wilma wed in 1942. 
After Ed returned home from the war, he 
and Wilma moved to Concord where they 
raised their family. Ed worked for Contra 
Costa County, serving as the Assistant County 
Treasurer—Tax Collector. In 1970, Ed was 
elected as the County Treasurer—Tax Col-
lector and served two terms before retiring. 
Ed’s military service, commitment to his 
community, and his 9 grandchildren and 20 
great-grandchildren are a legacy to be proud 
of. Please join me in congratulating Ed on his 
100th birthday and his life of service.

IN HONOR OF SHIRLEY GREGORY 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor and privilege 
to recognize a dedicated public servant who 
continues to make our community proud as a 
Ward Leader. As public officials, entrusted by 
their peers to oversee elections and party ac-
tivity, Philadelphia Ward Leaders represent a 
corps of unsung heroes that help facilitate the 
progress that molds our city. I am honored to 
be joined by one of our most distinguished, 
esteemed Ward Leaders today, and in com-
memoration of Black History Month, ensure 
that their contributions to our city remain en-
shrined in our historical record for generations 
to recognize. 
Black History Month is more than a mere 
byline on the month of February, it is an op-
portunity to celebrate and recognize the ex-
traordinary contributions that the African Amer-
ican community has made, and continues to 
make, on our nation’s history and culture. And 
I can think of no honoree more deserving of 
this recognition, who embodies the selfless 
commitment to their neighbors and peers, than 
Shirley Gregory. 
Shirley Gregory of Ward 49 is no stranger to 
Congress after serving as Congressman Bob 
Brady’s District Director. She embodies the 
qualities that make for a successful Ward 
Leader by facilitating candidate meet and 
greets, hosting ballot machine demonstrations, 
and helping our officials disseminate informa-
tion to the public. She keeps her finger on the 
pulse of local, state, and federal politics, help-
ing those of the 49th ward learn how they can 
get involved and make a difference in their 
community. With Shirley as the Ward Leader, 
I know every resident in her community has a 
friendly face and helpful resource. She is a 
staple in the city, and I am grateful of our 
overlap as we look to serve the people of 
Philadelphia. I thank Shirley. 
Taking after the long lineage of Philadel-
phians who have helped sculpt our democracy 
into an increasingly inclusive system that en-
courages public participation, Shirley Gregory 
has left her own mark on our city. I look for-
ward to years of collaboration so we can cre-
ate a more inclusive, representative democ-
racy throughout our community. 
RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF NEWMAN FIRST CHRIS-
TIAN CHURCH 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Newman First Christian Church on 
its one hundred and fiftieth anniversary. 
Newman First Christian Church was born in 
the hearts of a small band of believers in 
1870. An early focus of Newman First Chris-
tian was to make disciples of Jesus, and so 
for the first sixteen years the church did not 
have a regular minister and services were led 
by lay leaders, evangelists and circuit riders. 
As the congregation grew in spirit as well as 
in numbers, it soon outgrew its facilities. A 
new building was built to the glory of God on 
the corner of Green and King streets in New-
man in 1904 and is used to this day for wor-
ship. 
Throughout its history, pastors have gen-
erally served for short periods of time, the 
longest being only four years. Then in 1950, 
the church called Reverend Wolfe and for thir-
ty-seven years he served as its minister. After 
his death, the congregation took a step of faith 
in a new direction and in 1987 Newman First 
Christian became a ‘‘teaching congregation.’’ It 
was led by faithful men and women, preach-
ers, and ministers until, under the leadership 
of Perry Albin and Laverne Fraser, the church 
recruited its current pastor, Justin Smith, in 
November of 2017. 
The church is serious about loving Jesus, 
as well as creating opportunities for commu-
nity involvement, spiritual growth, and out-
reach. Newman First Christian, for example, 
continues to provide meals to various local 
school sports teams and prayer for local 
school events, sponsor community events, 
and offer biblical counseling to the congrega-
tion and community. This focus on service and 
outreach has improved the spiritual and phys-
ical well-being of countless people in the com-
munity. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure I 
stand to recognize Newman First Christian 
Church on its one hundred and fiftieth anniver-
sary. I wish Pastor Smith, the congregation, as 
well as the community of Newman, all the best 
for a bright and joyous future.

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BAKU POGROMS 
HON. KATHERINE M. CLARK 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 30th an-
niversary of the anti-Armenian pogroms in 
then-Soviet Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku. 
In January 1990, a violent seven-day long 
riot in Baku broke out against the city’s ethnic 
Armenian civilian population. Approximately 90 
Armenians were killed, and hundreds more 
were brutally beaten and forced to abandon 
their homes. The Baku Pogrom was just one 
of several anti-Armenian attacks that took 
place across Azerbaijan from 1988 to 1990 
that were enabled by the Azerbaijani govern-
ment. From Sumgait to Kirovabad and Baku, 
Armenian Christians living in the country were 
murdered, raped, and robbed. These vicious 
attacks led to the displacement of thousands 
of Armenian families fleeing the targeted vio-
lence as refugees. 
These were crimes against humanity that 
have still gone unrecognized by Azerbaijan. I 
call upon their government to acknowledge 
and condemn these acts of violence, actively 
prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes, 
and take all appropriate action so that these 
atrocities never happen again. 
Throughout history, the Armenian people 
have been targets of violence, murder and 
genocide. We must emphatically condemn 
these actions and any efforts to erase these 
atrocities from our collective memory. Failure 
to do so will only serve to embolden purveyors 
of violence against religious and ethnic minori-
ties around the globe. I look forward to work-
ing with my colleagues in the Armenian Cau-
cus to continue pushing policies promoting 
peace and human rights for Armenians and for 
all. 
If we do not stand up to hate, we cannot 
end the cycle of intolerance.

Peter Lyde. 
Peter Lyde, the Ward Leader for the 61st 
ward, helped shape our city’s justice depart-
ment and is a long-tenured labor organizer. In 
this modern age where technology has al-
lowed more and more people to access infor-
mation with ease, Peter has ensured the resi-
dents of Ward 61 can find helpful guidance on 
their political questions, and information on up-
coming events, by following their active social 
media accounts. As we look to bring in new 
participants to the political sphere, Peter mod-
els the innovation that will expand the elec-
torate and allow new voices to take part in our 
political process. With ward cookouts, commu-
nity gatherings, and seasonal events, he 
brings politics to his constituents, encouraging

IN HONOR OF KATHERINE 
JOHNSON 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise with my colleagues today to honor the 
life of Katherine Johnson and to celebrate the 
achievements of her 35-year career at NASA 
and its predecessor, NACA. Her passing has 
been felt around the world, but her legacy 
lives on in so many ways. 
Katherine Johnson will forever be remem-
bered for her tenacity in spite of the chal-
lenges women and African Americans faced in 
the workforce, as well as for her aptitude for 
mathematics that became central to the na-
tion’s success in landing the first human on 
the surface of the Moon. Her life and her ac-
complishments are inspiring to all, especially 
to young women and African Americans who 
dream of pursuing a career in STEM. May fu-
ture generations look to Katherine Johnson 
and her fellow Hidden Figures’ dedication to 
advance the NASA space program with admi-
ration and know that they too can follow in the 
footsteps of those talented women. 
As 
we 
pursue 
our 
nation’s 
human 
spaceflight programs and advance into the 
next phases of space exploration, we will al-
ways remember the immense role Katherine 
Johnson played to get us to where we are 
today.

OF 
THE 
99TH 
BIRTHDAY OF RUBLE RAY GARD-
NER 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I ask for the House’s attention to recognize 
Mr. Ruble Ray Gardner who will be turning 99 
on March 1, 2020. 
Mr. Gardner was born on March 1, 1921, 
and served his country in the Army and Air 
Force. During his service, he was stationed in 
Africa, Great Britain, the Middle East, Ger-
many, Paris, Alaska, Italy, the North Pole, Arc-
tic Circle and other locations. 
His wife, Ruth ‘‘Boots’’ Gardner, joined him 
in Great Britain. 
During his military career, he received nu-
merous medals including two Silver Stars, one 
Bronze Star and a Good Conduct award. 
Following his service in the military, Mr. 
Gardner was employed by the United States 
Postal Service. 
He was a resident of Childersburg, Alabama 
and a member of the CornerStone Church of 
Christ. He currently lives at the Bill Nichols 
State Veterans Home in Alexander City. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Ruble Ray Gardner and wishing him a 
very happy 99th birthday.

IN HONOR OF SHARON VAUGHN 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor and privilege 
to recognize a dedicated public servant who 
continues to make our community proud as a 
Ward Leader. As public officials, entrusted by 
their peers to oversee elections and party ac-

make, on our nation’s history and culture. And 
I can think of no honoree more deserving of 
this recognition, who embodies the selfless 
commitment to their neighbors and peers, than 
Sharon Vaughn. 
Sharon Vaughn, Leader for the 42nd ward, 
is transforming how this role can impact peo-
ple’s lives. Sharon, a dedicated employee of 
the City Council, serving as Chief of Staff to 
Councilman at Large Derek Clark, has used 
her ward position to ensure her constituents 
understand the impact of public policy on a 
granular level. The residents of Ward 42 are 
lucky to have such a knowledgeable, dedi-
cated representative who can articulate intri-
cate policies in a digestible way. Her under-
standing of how government can serve as a 
conduit for change is truly an asset for those 
living in Ward 42. I thank Sharon. 
Taking after the long lineage of Philadel-

CHESAPEAKE BAY GATEWAYS AND 
WATERTRAILS NETWORK REAU-
THORIZATION ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JOHN P. SARBANES 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 2427, the Chesapeake Bay 
Gateways and Watertrails Network Reauthor-
ization Act. 
This bipartisan bill will provide robust, long- 
term federal support for the Chesapeake Bay 
Gateways Program, which helps increase pub-
lic access to the Bay. 
As the largest estuary in the nation, the 
Chesapeake Bay extends through six states 
and the District of Columbia. It’s home to more 
than 18 million Americans and thousands of 
species of plants and animals. 
However, roughly 98 percent of the Chesa-
peake Bay’s 11,684 miles of shoreline is pri-
vately owned, leaving only a small fraction of 
shoreline available for public use. 
The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Program 
helps maximize this tiny fraction of public 
shoreline by improving infrastructure, signage 
and exhibits at key public access points 
throughout the Bay Watershed. The program 
also supports education initiatives that connect 
young Americans with the Bay Watershed and 
help instill a passion for environmental stew-
ardship. 
To date, the Gateways Program has in-
vested more than $20 million in 300 projects 
across the Bay Watershed, helping boost our 
region’s outdoor recreation economy. 
This small investment over the last few dec-
ades has not only succeeded in promoting 
meaningful educational and recreational expe-
riences for Marylanders and residents across 
the region but has also helped the National 
Park Service fulfill its responsibilities under the 
Chesapeake Bay Agreement. 
As a key ally in the effort to restore the 
Chesapeake Bay, the National Park Service 
works to increase land conservation, public 
access to the Bay, environmental stewardship, 
diversity and environmental education—all of 
which is supported by the Gateways Program. 
By connecting more Americans with the 
Bay, we can deepen ties to one of our coun-
try’s most important environmental treasures, 
inspire future generations of environmental 
stewards and give a tremendous boost to our 
region’s economy. 
I want to thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle for supporting this small, but 
mighty program. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bill.

OF

THE 
24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

HON. KENNY MARCHANT

Thursday, February 27, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Todd Martin, a member 
of my District Office staff for over a decade, 
for his outstanding and dedicated service to 
the United States House of Representatives 
and to the Twenty-Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict of Texas. 
Todd joined my staff over ten years ago ini-
tially as an intern, following his graduation 
from Baylor University in Waco, Texas with a 
Bachelor of Business Administration in Mar-
keting. He didn’t stay an intern for very long, 
as with his sharp talents he was quickly hired 
on to the permanent district office staff as the 
Director of District Affairs. Throughout his time 
in my office, Todd has been an integral part of 
the team, working diligently to provide out-
standing constituent service and helping to 
manage the daily operations of the district of-
fice. During this time, Todd has conducted

himself with the utmost dedication and profes-
sionalism, ensuring the needs of every con-
stituent he encountered were addressed to the 
fullest extent possible. Going above and be-
yond the normal expectations of a Congres-
sional staffer is a normal day for Todd. 
Todd’s tireless efforts ensured countless 
constituents received federal assistance, un-
paid benefits, and additional earned services 
provided by the federal government which 
may have been delayed, misplaced, or un-
known to the constituent. Additionally, Todd’s 
efforts on the ground in the District ensured 
the legislative needs of constituents were 
heard and communicated to myself and my 
legislative team in Washington, D.C. This work 
often goes unnoticed but was instrumental in 
ensuring voices of the 24th District were con-
stantly heard in Congress. Todd’s commitment 
to public service is apparent in his pursuit of 
excellence in the public sector. During his time 
on my staff, Todd acquired a master’s in pub-
lic administration from the University of North 
Texas in 2012, further improving his abilities to 
serve the American public. 
In a very bittersweet moment, this upcoming 
Friday, February 28th will be Todd’s last day 
working for the people of the Twenty-Fourth 
Congressional District. He will leave as the 
fourth longest serving staffer in the office dur-
ing my time in Congress. Todd will be con-
tinuing his commitment to public service in a 
new capacity, as he will soon be working for 
the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern Dis-
trict of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
the contributions Todd has made to the 24th 
Congressional District of Texas, The State of 
Texas, and the United States of America. I 
ask all of my distinguished colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Todd Martin and his out-
standing service. We wish him well in his next 
chapter of public service.

Renee McNear. 
Renee McNear, who leads Ward 20, has 
been extremely active in her first term. An ex-
perienced grassroots activist, Renee has 
taken it upon herself to educate voters not 
only on the importance of voting, but the value 
of being an informed and engaged voter. With 
a constituency that includes Temple Univer-
sity’s main campus, I can think of no better 
leader to inspire civic engagement in our 
youth, and I look forward to serving as her 
partner in the ever-important endeavor of in-
creasing turnout among the next generation of 
American leaders. I thank Renee. 
Taking after the long lineage of Philadel-
phians who have helped sculpt our democracy 
into an increasingly inclusive system that en-
courages public participation, Renee McNear 
has left her own mark on our city. I look for-
ward to years of collaboration so we can cre-
