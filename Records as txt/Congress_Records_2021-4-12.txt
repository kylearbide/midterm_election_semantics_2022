WASHINGTON, MONDAY, APRIL 12, 2021 
No. 62 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, we open our day, our 
week, in prayer, exercising with con-
fidence the faith that is found in our 
relationship with You. As our Muslim 
compatriots begin their Ramadan fast 
this evening, call each of us this day to 
return to You. May we humble our-
selves before You, yielding both our 
bodies and souls to Your guidance, and 
fasting from arrogance and self-preser-
vation. 
So easily our wills are enticed by de-
sires and ambitions, leading us to trust 
solely in our own abilities and judg-
ments, and ignoring the provisions and 
intentions You, in Your bounteous 
grace, supply us daily. 
Transform us, that in our want, we 
would seek for and find all that we 
need in the shelter of Your mercy and 
steadfast love. And in receiving Your 
benevolence, may we be inspired to live 
our lives with abundant charity and 
kindness. 
We pray for Your protection over this 
our life’s journey. Give us, our chil-
dren, and our country awareness of 
Your presence with us along the paths 
You set before us. 
We pray in the abiding love of Your 
holy name. 
Amen.

RAMADAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today 
marks the first day of Ramadan. For 
the second year in a row, Muslims 
around the world will be celebrating Is-
lam’s holiest month in the midst of 
this pandemic. 
Traditionally, Ramadan is an oppor-
tunity for families to gather in prayer 
and break bread together after a day- 
long fast, but I know many people of 
the Muslim faith will not have that op-
portunity this year. It is a painful re-
minder of all the sacrifices all of us 
have been called to make since the be-
ginning of this pandemic. 
For all of those who observe, may 
this holy month be a time of peace for 
you and your loved ones, and I hope 
you will be able to break bread to-
gether soon. 
HONORING OFFICER WILLIAM F. EVANS 
Mr. President, today is also another 
day of mourning for the men and 
women of the U.S. Capitol Police 
Force. 
I spent much of my life working in 
this building as a college student, law 
student, staff member, Congressman, 
and Senator. This building has a spe-
cial place in my life and in the lives of 
many Americans. It is an enduring 
symbol of American freedom and de-
mocracy. It is recognized around the 
world. 
Sadly, it is also a target for mean- 
spirited attackers and troubled souls. 
We saw that on January 6, when a mob 
invaded these halls and this Chamber. 
We saw it on 9/11, when terrorists hi-
jacked a plane with the intent of crash-
ing it into this building. And, sadly, we 
saw it again on April 2 with the vehic-
ular attack on the north entrance bar-
ricade to the Capitol, one of the most 
frequently used entrances. 
The men and women of the U.S. Cap-
itol Police guard this Capitol 24/7, 365. 
They put their lives at risk to protect 
this building and those of us who work 
here and those who visit. They literally 
risk their lives for us. It is the clearest 
symbol of heroism that I can think of. 
On April 2, one of those heroes, Cap-
itol Police Officer Billy Evans, made 
the ultimate sacrifice. He was killed in 
the line of duty defending the people in 
this building. 
Officer Evans was 41 years old—41. 
An 18-year veteran of the Capitol Po-
lice, he was a familiar, friendly face to 
many of us here at the Capitol, where 
he often worked at the north entrance. 
Officer Evans was a native of North 
Adams, MA, a father of two children, 
Logan and Abigail. His family said that 
he was ‘‘the best father, son, brother, 
and friend that anyone could ever hope 
for.’’ They went on to say: 
The absolute most important thing in life 
was his two children. . . . He was always so 
eager to show how proud he was of every-
thing they did. Any opportunity to spend 
time with his children brightened both their 
lives and his. Their dad was their hero long 
before the tragic events of last week. 
The loss of Officer Evans is heart-
breaking. I join in praying for his fam-
ily and loved ones. 
We also send our prayers to Officer 
Ken Shaver, who was injured in the 
April 2 attack, and we wish him a 
speedy recovery. 
The U.S. Capitol Police have faced 
incredible hardship this year with the 
loss of three officers: Officer Evans, Of-
ficer Brian Sicknick, and Officer How-
ard Liebengood. And 80 officers were 
seriously injured in the insurrectionist 
mob attack on January 6.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1860 
April 12, 2021 
The debt that we owe Capitol Police 
officers like Officer Evans can never be 
repaid, and the same is true for Capitol 
Police Officers Brian Sicknick, Howard 
Liebengood, Jacob Chestnut, and De-
tective Michael Gibson, and others who 
have been injured or lost their lives 
through their service. Our gratitude for 
their sacrifice cannot be captured by 
words. 
This Tuesday, Officer Evans will lie 
in honor in the Capitol Rotunda, where 
those whom he died to protect can pass 
by and pay their respects. 
Every day it is incumbent for those 
of us who work in this building to re-
member this brave officer and to thank 
him and the men and women of the 
U.S. Capitol Police, who have given so 
much to keep us safe. 
(Ms. HIRONO assumed the Chair.) 
FILIBUSTER 
Madam President, on January 8, I 
think most Americans—most of the 
world, really—were still deeply shaken 
by what happened in this building on 
January 6, when the mob broke in. 
January 6 was an assault on Amer-
ican democracy. It was an armed insur-
rection not just against this building 
but against the Constitution and the 
Government of the United States of 
America. 
The violent mob was sent to this 
Capitol by a defeated President who 
tried to cancel an American election. 
That mob overran and ransacked this 
Capitol, smashing windows and doors. 
They built a gallows on the Capitol 
grounds and called for the Vice Presi-
dent to be hanged for following his du-
ties under the Constitution, for refus-
ing to join in the coup attempt. 
People died that day in this building 
and on these grounds. Capitol Police 
Officer Brian Sicknick, whom I men-
tioned earlier, suffered fatal injuries 
trying to hold back the insurrectionist 
mob sent by the President. Two more 
officers who fought to save the Capitol 
died by suicide in the days that fol-
lowed. More than 140 police officers 
suffered serious injuries. Many of them 
are still recovering. 
But the insurrection at the Capitol, 
the attack on American democracy, 
wasn’t what alarmed the dark-money 
special interests that came together 
for an all-hands-on-deck conference 
call just 2 days later, on January 8. 
The conference call was organized by 
a group with the innocuous name 
‘‘Stand Together’’—the group that is 
run by the Koch brothers’ organization, 
well known to anyone who follows 
American politics. Among the partici-
pants on this private conference call 
was an adviser to the minority leader, 
Senator MCCONNELL. 
We know these things because a re-
cording of the conference call found its 
way to Jane Mayer, an investigative 
reporter for The New Yorker magazine, 
who has written a book on the Koch 
brothers and dark money in politics. 
What alarmed the dark-money spe-
cial interests on that conference call 
was not the violent insurrection in this 
building 2 days earlier. According to 
Ms. Mayer’s reporting, the reason the 
special interests were frightened was 
because they could not find a way to 
turn the American people against a 
piece of legislation, S. 1, a bill known 
as the For the People Act. 
The For the People Act is a democ-
racy defense bill. It would limit the in-
fluence of dark money and special in-
terests on our politics, and it would 
improve access to the ballot box for 
American voters. 
We know that access is under attack 
today. In Georgia and 30 other States, 
efforts are being made to suppress the 
American vote. 
The Koch brothers’ group spends its 
money freely to insert political con-
trol. They sent the pollsters out before 
this conference call to test every at-
tack they could think of against this 
bill. Nothing worked. 
Let me read you a passage from Ms. 
Mayer’s article. It is a bit long. So bear 
with me. This is based on a recording 
of the call. 
‘‘Kyle McKenzie, the research direc-
tor for the Koch-run advocacy group 
Stand Together, told fellow conserv-
atives and Republican congressional 
staffers on the call that he had a ‘spoil-
er.’ When presented with a very neutral 
description of the bill, people were gen-
erally supportive,’’ McKenzie said, add-
ing, ‘‘The most worrisome part is con-
servatives were actually as supportive 
as the general public when they heard 
the neutral description. In fact, he 
warned, there is a large, very large, 
chunk of conservatives who are sup-
portive of these efforts.’’ 
As a result, Mayer wrote, ‘‘McKenzie 
conceded the legislation’s opponents 
would likely have to rely on Repub-
lican Senators, where the bill is now 
under debate, to use what they called 
‘under the dome’ strategies’’—legisla-
tive maneuvers such as the filibuster— 
to stop the bill, because turning public 
opinion against it would be incredibly 
difficult. 
S. 1, the For the People Act, is a bill 
to stop billionaires from buying elec-
tions. You can see why Charles Koch, 
who has grown accustomed to using his 
wealth to influence elections and domi-
nate the national agenda, wouldn’t like 
that kind of a bill. And you can see 
why he and others, members of the 
dark-money power elite, would be 
alarmed that all the spin-doctoring 
that money can buy can’t turn people 
against the bill. It can’t even turn con-
servatives against the bill. 
What is a poor billionaire to do? 
Well, they said it right there on the 
conference call. They can’t debate the 
bill because they don’t have a winning 
argument. Senator MCCONNELL is just 
going to have to kill it ‘‘under the 
dome.’’ Senator MCCONNELL is going to 
have to filibuster it. 
One of the myths that defenders of 
the filibuster like to use is that it en-
courages debate and compromise. In re-
ality, today’s phone-it-in, remote con-
trol filibuster is used to make sure de-
bate never even starts. 
There is another myth the defenders 
of the filibuster would like us to be-
lieve. They say, and Senator MCCON-
NELL has repeated it, the filibuster has 
nothing to do with race. History tells 
us the opposite is true. The filibuster 
has always been more a creation of 
James Crow than James Madison. Seg-
regationists used filibusters to block 
anti-lynching bills in 1922, 1923, 1924, 
1935, and 1938. Segregationist Senators 
filibustered bills to outlaw poll taxes 
in 1942, 1944, and 1946. Segregationist 
Senators filibustered bills outlawing 
discrimination in employment, hous-
ing, and voting in 1957, 1960, and 1964. 
Every time segregationists used the fil-
ibuster to block civil rights measures, 
they spoke of the tactic as nearly a sa-
cred principle passed down by our 
Founding Fathers. 
Now, with voting rights under the 
broadest attack in more than 50 years, 
with hundreds of bills being introduced 
in State legislatures to make it harder 
for many Americans—especially people 
of color—to vote, we are once again 
facing a threat of a filibuster in a vot-
ing rights protection bill in the Senate. 
History repeats itself. 
Largely under Senator MCCONNELL’s 
leadership, today’s filibuster has been 
transformed into a weapon of mass ob-
struction. In 2009, during the Great Re-
cession, America was in a financial free 
fall, our economy teetering on the edge 
of another depression, millions out of 
work, and homes and life savings at 
risk. 
Senator MCCONNELL said: ‘‘My No. 1 
priority is to make sure President 
Obama is a one-term President.’’ And 
the No. 1 weapon he used to make good 
on his threat: the filibuster. 
Now America has a new President. 
Senator MCCONNELL wasn’t able to fili-
buster 
President 
Biden’s 
American 
Rescue Plan because we used reconcili-
ation. All 50 Democratic Senators, plus 
the Vice President, were prepared to 
vote and break the tie. Not one single 
Republican Senator would vote for 
President Biden’s rescue plan. 
Today, America is getting shots in 
the arm, and people are getting checks 
in their pockets because we passed that 
bill despite the intransigence of the 
other side of the aisle. We are begin-
ning—just 
beginning—to 
break 
the 
back of this pandemic. There are still 
hotspots and worrisome reports, but we 
are beginning to break its back, and we 
are helping the millions of Americans 
who are hurting financially because of 
the pandemic shutdown. 
Now the Senate is ready to start 
work on the next chapter of our na-
tional economic recovery. President 
Biden’s American Jobs Plan is a bold 
plan to invest in climate change, job 
creation, and create the good jobs and 
the industries of the future here in 
America—not overseas, not in China, 
but here in America. That is President 
Biden’s goal. 
It would rebuild our roads, bridges, 
rails, ports, airports, and water sys-
tems. I learned during the break that,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1861 
April 12, 2021 
until 1986, the city of Chicago man-
dated in its plumbing code that the 
service line from the water main to the 
home be made of lead—lead. We know 
lead is dangerous to everyone, cer-
tainly to children, and yet we have 23 
percent of the lead service lines in 
America in Chicago and the sur-
rounding area. That is a public health 
hazard. Some may not think that is in-
frastructure, but if you can’t deliver 
safe drinking water to America, what 
else is important? 
We need to rebuild our 5G broadband 
internet and expand it, renewable en-
ergy, and advanced research and tech-
nology. We need to create millions of 
jobs and to lay the foundation for 
American economic prosperity for dec-
ades to come. 
Last night, on 60 Minutes, Chairman 
Jerome Powell spoke and was inter-
viewed. It was a most encouraging re-
port. He really believes we are right on 
the cusp of moving this Nation for-
ward—dramatic increase in economic 
growth in this country. Isn’t it about 
time? Don’t we want a President who 
will invest in America to make that 
happen? 
Senator MCCONNELL has already said 
he opposes President Biden’s American 
Jobs Plan. Will our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle really filibuster 
this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for 
America to lead the global economy of 
the 21st century? Will they really fili-
buster America’s ability to compete 
and win against China in the competi-
tion for jobs and industries of the fu-
ture? I hope not. 
We are all sent to the Senate with a 
job, to fix the problems, not paralyze 
Congress. Despite what the dark money 
special interests might want, we should 
aim higher than killing good solutions 
with the filibuster. Let’s talk, let’s 
meet, and let’s reason things out. Let’s 
negotiate, and let’s pass laws that pro-
tect America’s democracy and our eco-
nomic prosperity. 
On January 6, hundreds of police offi-
cers risked their lives to protect de-
mocracy. Don’t we owe them, for their 
courage and sacrifice, the respect of 
doing the work of democracy? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
HONORING OFFICER WILLIAM F. EVANS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on Good Friday, the U.S. Capitol Police 
were subjected to another violent at-
tack. Once again, our uniformed heroes 
wound up in harm’s way, and Officer 
Billy Evans, a friend and favorite of 
many here on the Senate side and a 
faithful protector of the Capitol, was 
killed. 
Investigators are still assessing what 
drove the perpetrator to attempt this 
attack on the Capitol and whether do-
mestic, violent extremism played a 
role. He appears to have been cap-
tivated by the Nation of Islam—a rac-
ist, anti-Semitic, extreme group under 
the 
openly 
hateful 
leader, 
Louis 
Farrakhan. 
His attack injured Officer Ken Shav-
er, and it stole away the life of Officer 
Evans from his children Logan and 
Abigail, his mother Janice, his entire 
family, and all of his friends and col-
leagues decades too soon. 
Officer Evans was famous within the 
Senate for his friendly spirit and easy 
manner. He was the first face that 
many would see on the way to work 
here in the Capitol every day. His par-
ticular post often meant he was lit-
erally the first line of defense of the 
Congress—the interface between these 
grounds and the outside world. We 
could not have had a kinder and more 
likeable ambassador at this juncture or 
a more faithful protector to keep us 
safe. 
It will be with tremendous grief, but 
tremendous gratitude, that we will 
welcome Officer Evans to the Capitol 
for a final time tomorrow where he will 
lie in honor in the Rotunda. 
I think I speak for the entire Senate 
when I salute all of our U.S. Capitol 
Police officers for the heroism, cour-
age, and resilience they displayed the 
Friday before last and which they dis-
play every single day. The Senate and 
the Nation are profoundly grateful for 
your selfless service. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Madam President, now, on a com-
pletely different matter, the Senate re-
turns today from its State work period. 
We got to meet with constituents in 
our home States and hear firsthand 
about their most pressing concerns. 
Unfortunately, back here in Wash-
ington, Democrats continue to roll out 
new reasons for the American people to 
worry. The week before last, the Biden 
administration unveiled their latest 
misleadingly titled legislation. This 
time, under the supposed veil of ‘‘infra-
structure,’’ 
the 
White 
House 
has 
lumped together a motley assortment 
of the left’s priciest priorities. 
This plan would impose one of the 
biggest tax hikes in a generation when 
workers need an economic recovery. It 
would gut right-to-work protections 
for blue-collar workers. It would throw 
hundreds of billions at the far left’s 
green fads. They even want to include 
a special State and local tax provision 
designed to overwhelmingly benefit 
wealthy residents of blue States. Less 
than 6 percent of this proposal goes to 
roads and bridges. It is not remotely 
targeted toward what Americans think 
they are getting when politicians cam-
paign on infrastructure. 
But instead of coming up with a bet-
ter bill, Democrats have decided it is 
the English language that has to 
change. They are embarking on an Or-
wellian campaign to convince every-
body that any government policy what-
soever can be labeled ‘‘infrastructure.’’ 
Liberals just have to believe in it hard 
enough. 
These Trojan horse tactics have be-
come a pattern. Many of our Demo-
cratic colleagues are trying to rewrite 
50 States’ election laws from here in 
Washington and mount a partisan 
takeover of the Federal Election Com-
mission but call the whole mess a ‘‘vot-
ing rights bill.’’ 
The White House’s claims about 
State election regulations keep getting 
disproven by fact checkers. But even 
so, some of the wealthiest and most 
powerful institutions in our country 
have bowed down to the fake nar-
ratives and decided to amplify the 
misstatements themselves. 
So, look, I am as strong a supporter 
of the First Amendment and free 
speech as anyone in this body. I have 
been for many years. If people want to 
participate in debates through political 
speech, that is certainly their constitu-
tional right, even if they fall for 
disinformation. But it is one thing to 
act like free speakers within a debate; 
it is very different to try to short-cir-
cuit the debate, to shut down the de-
bate through economic bullying of 
American citizens. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Madam President, the last 2 weeks 
also brought more troubling signs from 
our southern border. Last month closed 
with Customs and Border Patrol re-
porting the highest total for migrant 
apprehensions in nearly two decades. 
But while Republican Senators trav-
eled to the border, met with officials, 
and learned about the reality on the 
ground, the administration has pre-
ferred to inaccurately blame this re-
cent spike on their predecessors. 
BUDGET PROPOSAL 
Madam President, finally—finally— 
last week, the White House rolled out a 
new budget proposal. I have been a sup-
porter of Secretary Blinken and other 
officials’ tough talk with the People’s 
Republic of China. With Putin again 
massing forces on Ukraine’s border, ad-
ministration officials have been right— 
right—to warn against further Russian 
aggression. 
This budget outline was going to be 
one of the first real tests to see if the 
administration was prepared to walk 
the walk and put sufficient funding to-
ward our military and strategic com-
petition with China and Russia, both of 
which have invested heavily in mili-
tary capabilities that threaten our 
forces. Unfortunately, for all the rhet-
oric, the President has asked Congress 
to break from the positive trajectory of 
the last 4 years and instead cut defense 
spending after inflation. 
That is going backward on national 
defense. This would undermine recent 
bipartisan progress, put the moderniza-
tion of American forces in jeopardy, 
and help China toward their goal of 
overtaking the United States as the 
world’s preeminent superpower.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1862 
April 12, 2021 
This budget proposal sent a clear sig-
nal to the rest of the world, and unfor-
tunately it suggests to our allies, from 
Eastern Europe to the South China 
Sea, that American resolve is far from 
guaranteed. 
On all these issues, there is broad and 
deep bipartisan interest in working to-
gether—infrastructure legislation that 
actually focuses on infrastructure, vot-
ing legislation that actually makes it 
easier to vote and harder to cheat, and 
funding legislation that provides the 
Pentagon what it needs to keep up 
with China, Russia, and other adver-
saries. Legislation on all these topics 
has a track record of earning over-
whelming bipartisan support. 
All these issues are ripe for regular 
order, bipartisan work if the President 
and our Democratic colleagues are in-
terested in going about them in the 
right way. But if the administration 
decides to reprise their tactics from 
February and March, if Democrats just 
declare ‘‘our way or the highway,’’ we 
will know they have chosen to create 
political 
controversies 
rather 
than 
make progress for American families. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, once again, I am here today to 
talk about the crisis at our southern 
border and the continued dismantling 
of our Nation’s immigration system by 
this administration. 
The border has been dominating the 
headlines, but if you talked to the lib-
erals, you wouldn’t know it. While we 
were back home working in our States, 
Democrats focused on everything but 
the border. President Biden released a 
so-called infrastructure proposal that 
is not actually about infrastructure; it 
is nothing more than the Green New 
Deal in disguise, and it raises taxes on 
hard-working Americans. 
Additionally, large corporations and 
Major League Baseball decided to give 
in to the demands of the woke, liberal 
mob based on nothing more than pure 
disinformation. 
I know President Biden and Demo-
crats would rather talk about those 
issues than confront the dire situation 
at the southern border. They are trying 
to pull a con job on the American peo-
ple. Well, we are not going to let Presi-
dent Biden distract from a crisis of his 
own making. 
In a recent House hearing, Depart-
ment of Homeland Security Secretary 
Mayorkas made a ridiculous claim that 
‘‘the border is secure.’’ To say the bor-
der is secure is laughable. I recently 
joined Senators CORNYN and CRUZ and 
other colleagues on a visit to the 
southern border to see for ourselves, 
and I can tell you and the American 
people without hesitation, the border is 
not secure. Reports just don’t do it jus-
tice. It is a disaster. As an American 
who believes in the rule of law, I was 
embarrassed. This is not a Democratic 
or a Republican problem; it is an Amer-
ican problem. This crisis is a stain on 
our Nation. 
What we saw on our trip broke my 
heart—so many young, unaccompanied 
children sent on a dangerous journey 
north by their parents because this ad-
ministration promised to take them in. 
The compassion shown by the Border 
Patrol agents was clear. These brave 
men and women are doing all they can 
to make the best out of a terrible situ-
ation—a 
situation 
created 
by 
our 
President and his administration. 
I have said it before, and I will say it 
again: The situation happening at our 
southern border was predictable and 
preventable. The Border Patrol folks 
know this will happen and that it 
would happen. They told us how they 
asked the Border Patrol before the in-
auguration to give them time to pre-
pare for any changes to the immigra-
tion policy, but President Biden didn’t 
listen. He was more interested in ap-
peasing the globalists who demanded 
he immediately end President Trump’s 
successful border policies. 
On his first day in office, President 
Biden reversed President Trump’s poli-
cies and signaled to the world that the 
American border was open. President 
Biden gave Border Patrol little to no 
warning. The result has been a border 
that is not run by the United States; it 
is run by the Mexican cartel and 
human smugglers. 
What is worse, it is not just people 
who are coming in illegally. While I 
was down at the border, I saw firsthand 
how criminals take advantage of the 
situation. Cartels send migrants to spe-
cific locations along the border to pre-
occupy law enforcement while moving 
illegal drugs at other crossing points. 
On a midnight visit to the Rio Grande, 
these traffickers actually taunted us 
from across the river, yelling and flash-
ing their lights. They know the Biden 
administration is unwilling to confront 
them, and because the administration 
won’t confront them, we have seen 
massive increases in drug seizures. 
In January and February alone, Cus-
toms and Border Patrol seizures of 
fentanyl were up 277 percent compared 
to the same time in 2020. Cocaine seized 
at the border is up 62 percent. And, re-
member, whether it is people or drugs, 
these numbers only account for those 
we catch. There are many more drug 
runners who get through undetected. 
Secretary Mayorkas has said the ad-
ministration’s goal is a safe, legal, and 
orderly immigration system. Well, so 
far, he and they have failed on all 
three. The immigration system under 
the Biden administration is not safe. 
By encouraging the migrants to come 
to the border, President Biden has em-
powered the drug cartels and coyotes 
who prey on desperate people. 
According to Mexican intelligence 
assessments, it costs an unaccom-
panied Central American minor be-
tween $3,000 and $10,000 to be secured 
across the U.S. border. An open border 
also invites wolves in sheep’s clothing. 
According to Customs and Border Pro-
tection, at least four people have been 
arrested in the last few months at the 
border who match names on the FBI’s 
Terrorist Screening Database. There is 
no doubt that those who wish harm 
will take advantage of this crisis to in-
filtrate our country. 
The Biden administration also is not 
enforcing the laws written by Congress. 
That is why I joined with 39 of my Re-
publican colleagues to send a letter to 
the nonpartisan Government Account-
ability Office to investigate President 
Biden’s unilateral decision to freeze 
funds for the border wall. 
Congress 
specifically 
appropriated 
funds for border wall construction. I 
believe the President’s actions infringe 
on Congress’s constitutional power of 
the purse. I hope the GAO will quickly 
look into this so we can begin to re-
store border security. 
Finally, 
the 
immigration 
system 
under the Biden administration is not 
orderly. In fact, it is chaotic. Our Bor-
der Patrol agents are overwhelmed. In 
March of this year, Border Patrol ar-
rested more than 170,000 migrants 
crossing the border illegally. That is 
the worst month in 15 years. To put 
that in perspective for the folks back 
home, that means there are more ille-
gal migrants rushing our border in 1 
month than the entire population of 
Lee County, AL, where I live. 
Last month, more than 18,700 unac-
companied minors were taken into cus-
tody by the Border Patrol. That is dou-
ble the number they encountered in 
February. 
This chaos is due entirely to Presi-
dent Biden’s careless words and foolish 
policies. The Biden administration is 
content to let all who come here ille-
gally stay. That is a recipe for disaster. 
The result is a border catastrophe. 
I have spoken previously about com-
monsense actions to secure the border, 
such as continuing to build the wall 
and reinstating Migrant Protection 
Protocols. Here is one more. I recently 
introduced a bill that would require 
DHS to issue a notice to appear—called 
an NTA—to every migrant who is proc-
essed at the border. 
We cannot—we cannot continue to 
release illegal immigrants into our 
country without establishing some ac-
countability, such as a date for immi-
gration court. At best, it hurts those 
who come to this country actually 
looking to plead their asylum case. At 
worst, it is giving free rein to those 
who enter our country illegally. 
The Biden administration says they 
want humane and compassionate im-
provements to our immigration sys-
tem. Releasing someone without an 
NTA is neither. 
My bill also requires the Department 
of Homeland Security to revoke any

status and work authorization from a 
migrant who doesn’t show up for their 
court date. This mandate will curb the 
pull factors embedded in our immigra-
tion system and cut down on incentives 
for illegal immigration. It is a small 
but meaningful step. It is about restor-
ing integrity in our immigration sys-
tem. 
President Biden has made weak at-
tempts to turn back the tide of mi-
grants, 
even 
telling 
them: 
‘‘Don’t 
come.’’ President Biden’s actions speak 
louder than those two feeble words. 
Well, Mr. President, as we say in Ala-
bama, you are a day late and a dollar 
short. 
My Republican colleagues and I will 
continue to demand action from the 
President on this crisis on behalf of the 
legal citizens of the United States of 
America. I stand ready to work with 
the President and his administration 
on commonsense solutions to secure 
the border, strengthen national secu-
rity, and protect the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
first, I would like to associate myself 
with the refined remarks of the Sen-
ator from Alabama because I, too, have 
come to talk about the crisis on our 
southern border. 
The Senator from Alabama and I 
traveled together, along with Senator 
CRUZ and Senator CORNYN, just a few 
weeks ago. I think we had a total of 19 
Senators who went to see the crisis 
firsthand. 
And, in fact, it is not just one crisis, 
as the Senator from Alabama and I 
have both spoken about. It is a double 
crisis. It is a national security crisis as 
well as a humanitarian crisis. 
We went on a midnight patrol. And 
what did we see at midnight? Well, we 
saw, and we heard. Not just did we see 
the lights on, on the other side of the 
Rio Grande; we heard the catcalls from 
traffickers who were taunting our U.S. 
Border Patrol agents, saying in Span-
ish: You cannot stop us now. That is 
what we are hearing from the criminals 
and the traffickers across the Rio 
Grande. 
We saw signs on the ground directing 
migrants to the facilities where they 
will then turn themselves in, and we 
spoke to the Border Patrol agents. 
They told us that their jobs got an 
awful lot harder on January 20, which 
is the day Joe Biden became President 
of the United States. 
President Biden flipped over the sign 
and sent a clear message around the 
world that said the U.S. border is now 
wide open. Because of that clear mes-
sage, Border Patrol arrests and deten-
tions have doubled since January. 
In March, Border Patrol took 171,000 
migrants into custody. Nearly 19,000 of 
those 
were 
unaccompanied 
minors. 
That is an alltime record in the United 
States. And the pace that we are on 
now is to get to 2 million illegal immi-
grants crossing our border this very 
year. 
According to the Secretary of Home-
land Security, nominated by President 
Biden, this is the most in 20 years—the 
most in 20 years, right now, this year, 
under President Biden. The Biden 
White House has essentially told the 
world anyone under 18 can cross our 
border, and we will let you in. So it is 
no surprise that today we are seeing a 
historic influx of children, of teenagers 
crossing our border. 
The Border Patrol agents tell us two- 
thirds of them can’t do their regular 
jobs because they are too busy baby-
sitting these children or escorting 
adults to the areas where they will 
turn themselves in. More children 
today are in Border Patrol custody 
than ever before. And in a day of a 
global pandemic, I will tell you, as I 
was there with the Senators in a loca-
tion 
designed 
for 
250 
during 
coronavirus, there were 7,000 crammed 
in like sardines, with foil blankets to 
huddle 
under, 
and 
no 
social 
distancing—none at all. 
This is a Biden-created humanitarian 
crisis. Under the law, children can only 
be in Border Patrol custody for 72 
hours. We wouldn’t want our own chil-
dren there for 72 minutes. Yet there are 
thousands and thousands in custody for 
over 10 days. 
And 10 percent of the young people 
being tested are testing positive for 
coronavirus. We watched the testing in 
the courtyard where I was. They were 
all together, and then they tested 
some, and they said: OK. You test neg-
ative. You go that way. You test posi-
tive. You go that way. 
But absolutely every one of them was 
exposed to each other. So with the fact 
that 10 percent are testing positive, it 
is highly likely that the remainder will 
test positive as well. And what is the 
Biden 
administration 
doing 
about 
that? They are sending those young 
people—either those people just ex-
posed to coronavirus, just standing 
right 
next 
to 
somebody 
with 
coronavirus, sending them all across 
the country, exposed to whoever knows 
what strain of coronavirus it was. 
So this is a humanitarian crisis, but, 
I will tell you, it is also a national se-
curity crisis. The Department of Home-
land Security has now arrested two 
men from the country of Yemen who 
are on the terrorist watchlist. The Bor-
der Patrol says they were apprehending 
people not just from Central America 
and Mexico, they have apprehended 
people from 56 different countries there 
at the border since President Biden has 
taken the oath of office. 
Last week, Border Patrol agents out-
side San Diego arrested a member of 
MS–13, one of the most vicious crimi-
nal gangs in the world. 
Now, these are just a couple of exam-
ples that we know about. Imagine 
things we don’t know about, the people 
who haven’t been caught, people who 
are roaming among us today in the 
United States. 
That is what I hear about in Wyo-
ming. I have just been home for 2 
weeks talking to people. This is the No. 
1 topic that I heard about traveling the 
State of Wyoming. 
So we have two crises at the southern 
border: the humanitarian crisis and the 
national 
security 
crisis. 
President 
Biden has caused them both, and Presi-
dent Biden can stop them. Yet the 
Biden administration is still in denial. 
It refuses to even admit that there is a 
crisis. President Biden still hasn’t been 
to the border. Neither has the Vice 
President, and she is supposed to be in 
charge of finding a solution to the 
problem. 
So, once again, today I call on Presi-
dent Biden and Vice President Harris 
to go to the border and face the truth. 
Today is the day. Go to the border. 
Face the truth. The President and Vice 
President should talk to the Border Pa-
trol agents. They should hear the sto-
ries that we have heard from them. It 
is the stories that they want to tell. 
They need to hear these stories. They 
need to face the reality. 
Border Patrol agents told me di-
rectly: Finish the wall and bring back 
the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy because 
those are things that will make a dif-
ference. Until we do those two things, 
the jobs of the Border Patrol agents 
will continue to get tougher and tough-
er every day. 
Vast numbers, vast majorities of 
American people support the Border 
Patrol agents. I know there are people 
on the other side of the aisle who want 
to eliminate Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement, want to get rid of the 
border line and having people who are 
patrolling the borders, want to get rid 
of it all and have open borders fully 
and without the kind of national secu-
rity that we need at our borders. 
But according to the Associated 
Press, only one in four Americans ap-
proves of how President Biden is han-
dling the border situation. President 
Biden should listen to the American 
people. We need change at the border. 
We need it today. We cannot wait. Our 
national security cannot wait. The hu-
manitarian crisis must be met and 
dealt with. 
Republicans are going to continue to 
offer commonsense solutions that will 
make a real difference at the border. 
We want to finish the wall. We want to 
bring back the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ 
policy. We want to stem this crisis— 
the humanitarian crisis and the na-
tional security crisis—that is facing 
our Nation today. We stand for enforc-
ing the law, for closing loopholes that 
encourage 
illegal 
immigration. 
We 
want to secure the border. 
So I would urge President Biden and 
all of my Democratic colleagues to 
please face the facts. Join us in our ef-
fort. It is time to bring this crisis to an 
end. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

April 12, 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
HONORING OFFICER WILLIAM F. EVANS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate returns to session in the 
shadow of tragedy. A week ago last 
Friday, the senseless attack on the 
Capitol by a lone actor injured one 
Capitol Police officer and claimed the 
life of another, Officer William ‘‘Billy’’ 
Evans. 
All of us in the Capitol and all of us 
across the Nation wish for the speedy 
recovery of Officer Shaver and mourn 
the loss of another fallen hero. 
To pay tribute to his final act of 
bravery, Officer Evans will lie in honor 
under the Capitol Rotunda, at the very 
center of the democracy he gave his 
life to protect. A service in his memory 
will take place tomorrow morning. 
For everyone who works in the Sen-
ate, his loss is particularly painful. He 
was a familiar face who greeted law-
makers, reporters, staffers, and em-
ployees at the north entrance as we en-
tered the Senate side of the building. 
Whether you knew him or not, his wide 
smile was often the first thing you 
would see in the morning. 
This has been an immensely difficult 
few months for members of the Capitol 
Police Force and for everyone who 
works behind the scenes to safeguard 
the Capitol Complex. Senate commit-
tees are conducting bipartisan and 
comprehensive reviews to ensure the 
Capitol is as secure as possible while 
also remaining accessible to the public. 
That is a top priority. 
But also, in this moment of profound 
loss, we need to comfort each other and 
support members of the Capitol Police, 
who, in 4 short months, have suffered a 
brutal attack by a violent mob and lost 
four of their friends and cherished col-
leagues. We must never, never take for 
granted the work they do, day in and 
day out, to guard this citadel of democ-
racy. 
I will have more to say tomorrow 
when we pay tribute to the life of Offi-
cer Evans. For now, I wish to extend 
my deep condolences to his friends and 
family, especially his two young chil-
dren, and everyone whose lives were 
enriched by knowing this incredible, 
incredible public servant. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Now, Madam President, on an en-
tirely other matter, as the Senate re-
turns to work this week, we are going 
to pick right back up where we left off 
in aggressively filling the Biden admin-
istration with well-qualified nominees 
and pursuing timely legislation that 
meets the needs of the American peo-
ple. 
This week, the Senate will vote on 
the nominations of Polly Trottenberg 
to serve as Deputy Secretary of Trans-
portation, Wendy Sherman to serve as 
Deputy 
Secretary 
of 
State, 
Gary 
Gensler to serve on the Securities and 
Exchange 
Commission, 
and 
Brenda 
Mallory to be a Member of the Council 
on Environmental Quality. Each is ex-
ceptionally well qualified for the re-
spective position and each, I expect, 
will receive bipartisan support here on 
the floor. 
I am particularly proud of Polly 
Trottenberg, who was my legislative 
director and legislative assistant on 
Transportation, I believe it was, for 9 
years. She then served as commissioner 
of transportation in New York City. 
One of the things, of course, that I 
talked to her about regularly was get-
ting Gateway, our much needed tunnel, 
built under the Hudson—so needed by 
New York, New Jersey, and the entire 
Northeast corridor. 
The Senate will also vote on whether 
to debate legislation from Senator 
HIRONO
and Representative MENG
to 
address the surge of anti-Asian hate 
crimes during the COVID pandemic. 
Over the past year, we have read hor-
rible accounts of violence and discrimi-
nation 
against 
Asian 
Americans, 
spurred on by ignorance and xeno-
phobia and the vicious slander that 
blames the Chinese people for COVID– 
19—slander that was often encouraged 
and repeated so regrettably—I so re-
gret that a President would stoop to 
that level—by the former President, 
who seemed to almost revel in advanc-
ing bigotry. 
Sadly, the recent spate of anti-Asian 
violence is not a new chapter in Amer-
ican history. From the Chinese mas-
sacre of 1871 to the explicitly racist 
Chinese Exclusion Act, the internment 
of Japanese-American citizens, and the 
shameful Korematsu Supreme Court 
decision, the Asian-American commu-
nity has long suffered the hammer 
blows of racism and bigotry. 
We cannot let this new surge, which 
contains echoes of these violent chap-
ters in our history, go unaddressed. So, 
this week, the Senate will vote on Sen-
ator HIRONO’s anti-Asian hate crimes 
bill, and I know the Presiding Officer is 
a proud sponsor of that legislation. 
The bill does two things. 
First, it tells the Department of Jus-
tice they need to make consideration 
of these hate crimes a top priority dur-
ing this pandemic. There is a scourge 
of abuse happening to the Asian-Amer-
ican community—shamefully aided and 
abetted by former President Trump— 
and it needs to be prioritized by law en-
forcement more than it is right now. 
Second, it sends a very important 
signal from the Congress of the United 
States to the American public: These 
crimes will not be tolerated, and there 
will be consequences. 
This legislation is as commonsense 
and straightforward as it gets. It is as 
unobjectionable as it gets. I should ex-
pect our work on Senator HIRONO’s 
hate crimes bill to be thoroughly bipar-
tisan. President Biden has urged Con-
gress to swiftly pass this legislation 
and send it to his desk. Let’s get it 
done this week. 
I attended four or five—maybe even 
more—rallies against anti-Asian vio-
lence, and I was heartsick to hear the 
stories: an elderly man afraid to just 
walk out on the street that he might 
be ridiculed, spat upon and a young 
lady who didn’t want to travel the sub-
ways because of the glares and stares 
at her from some people because of her 
Asian ancestry. The stories could be re-
peated over and over again, and, unfor-
tunately, this bigotry has often ended 
in violence. 
We must stop it as Americans. We all 
know—every one of us—that racism 
against one is racism against all. We 
must stop it. Again, I plead with my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
to let this legislation go forward—it 
seems so unobjectionable—and pass 
with a strong bipartisan vote. Again, 
let’s get it done this week. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Madam President, on infrastructure, 
finally, over the next several months, 
the Biden administration has said that 
it will push a comprehensive infra-
structure and jobs bill in coordination 
with Congress. This effort could not 
come at a better time. The American 
Rescue Plan is already delivering on its 
promise to lift the country out of the 
COVID crisis and set our economy back 
on the path to recovery. 
Over the State work period, I visited 
scores of restaurants, like Essie’s in 
Mount Carmel and Russo’s Grill in Am-
sterdam, that are now receiving a cru-
cial lifeline of assistance from the 
American Rescue Plan. I visited small 
and independent stages and venues, 
like the Bug Jar in Rochester, which 
will soon receive grants through the 
Save our Stages Act, and I met with 
community 
organizations 
to 
hear 
about how New York families are re-
ceiving thousands of dollars per child 
through the expanded child tax credit— 
or will be receiving, rather. That is a 
policy that is going to lift millions of 
American children out of poverty dur-
ing a time of economic hardship for so 
many. 
The American Rescue Plan is helping 
the country recover from the worst 
public health crisis in a century and 
the worst economic crisis in three- 
quarters of a century. Now, not later, 
is the time to build on that solid foun-
dation to create jobs and cement a ro-
bust economy. 
The next big step is a long overdue 
investment and a large and significant 
investment in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture. We know that our Nation’s roads 
and bridges and railways and water-
ways and ports are in need of an over-
haul. So too does our country need in-
vestment 
in 
modern 
infrastructure 
projects, 
like 
our 
electric 
grid, 
broadband internet access, and 5G, just 
to name a few. President Biden’s pro-
posal will address both our traditional 
infrastructure needs and invest in 21st 
century infrastructure projects that 
America sorely needs. 
Again, this very important work 
should be bipartisan. This is an issue

that affects all 50 States. Our two par-
ties used to agree on the need to reli-
ably 
invest 
in 
infrastructure. 
We 
should be able to do that again. Presi-
dent Biden is hosting bipartisan discus-
sions about his proposal at the White 
House today and will continue to bring 
lawmakers and stakeholders together 
to find common ground. I know that 
the administration is going to talk to 
Members from both sides of the aisle to 
incorporate their ideas. 
Every day now, millions of Ameri-
cans are getting the vaccine—4 million 
on 1 day over the weekend—and we are 
closer than ever to defeating the 
COVID–19 
pandemic. The worst of 
COVID–19 is, hopefully, in the rear 
view mirror. The streets of New York 
City, this weekend as I wandered 
about, were more alive than I have 
seen them in months. Soon we will 
have an opportunity to work together 
to strengthen our recovery and create 
the jobs of the future. A big, bold in-
vestment in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture is just the way to do it.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
have one short issue and another issue 
of about 10 minutes. 
Over the Easter break, I held a Q&A 
in 24 counties to hear what was on the 
minds of Iowans. It was my constitu-
ents’ agenda, not my agenda, that we 
discussed. From my cattle market 
transparency bill to Second Amend-
ment issues, COVID–19 vaccines, and 
the crisis at the southern border, 
Iowans are always up to date on the 
issues most important to them. 
One prominent question: Why can’t 
you guys in the Senate get along? In 
other words, ‘‘Why not more biparti-
sanship?’’ is a constant question I get. 
Iowans want Congress to work in a 
bipartisan way to enhance our Nation’s 
infrastructure through increased fund-
ing for roads, bridges, highways, water-
ways, and rural broadband, among 
many other infrastructure issues. 
Unfortunately, what I have heard so 
far about President Biden’s plan is that 
it is everything but the kitchen sink 
and not enough focus on just the big, 
big issue and the long-term issue of in-
frastructure. 
Iowans expect us to work in a bipar-
tisan way, and I hope Democrats will 
agree to work together with us, unlike 
the passage of the $1.9 trillion bill. 
SECTION 230 OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT 
I recently spoke on the Senate floor 
about the important issue of free 
speech. Today, I would like to speak on 
the power of Big Tech to censor free 
speech. 
It has been 25 years since section 230 
of the Communications Act was signed 
into law. This law grants wide-sweep-
ing immunity to interactive computer 
services that host third-party content. 
The goal of section 230 at the time 
was laudable. The internet was in its 
infancy, and content being posted to 
message boards by third parties was 
leading to litigation that threatened 
the spread of free speech and expres-
sion. Section 230 was enacted to en-
courage free speech, while giving com-
panies the ability to remove illegal and 
obscene materials. 
Section 230 and the legal shield it of-
fers helped to enable the internet to 
grow into what we know this very day. 
However, interactive computer services 
are no longer struggling companies but 
some of the largest corporations in the 
world today. Would you believe that 
when section 230 was signed into law, 
the 
words 
‘‘Google,’’ 
‘‘Facebook,’’ 
‘‘Twitter,’’ and ‘‘YouTube’’ did not 
even exist as words or companies? 
Today, they are giant, dominant tech 
companies. 
Many argue that these private com-
panies have their own terms of service 
and are able to enforce them as they 
wish and also that they are not covered 
under the First Amendment. Yet, these 
platforms are now the new public 
square, where it is important that all 
voices and viewpoints are able to be 
heard. 
With the immunities that these com-
panies have and the importance of dia-
logue on their platforms, arguably they 
are in effect state actors, and therefore 
First Amendment protections should 
apply to user-generated content. 
The size and power of these compa-
nies also contribute to their ability to 
censor speech and undermine the First 
Amendment. Google controls 87 per-
cent of search, Facebook has 2.8 billion 
monthly 
active 
users, 
500 
million 
tweets are sent on Twitter each day, 
and over 1 billion hours of videos are 
watched on YouTube every day. 
When a campaign has monopoly 
power, it no longer is constrained by 
normal market forces. If these plat-
forms 
had 
competitors, 
consumers 
could choose alternatives when they 
disagree with the terms of service or 
moderation policies. However, right 
now, the only choice consumers have is 
to take it or leave it. 
Section 230 appears to compound this 
problem. Big Tech has no competitors 
and is immune from liability. These 
companies are unaccountable to their 
customers, the courts, and the govern-
ment. If not for their monopoly power 
and section 230 immunity, these com-
panies might not be involved in the ac-
tions and the censorship we see today. 
These platforms are where people com-
municate online, and there are no real 
alternatives. 
This innovation has democratized 
our political system. I think that is 
good. Yet, there are people who don’t 
like that every person is able to get 
their views out, and they want to inter-
fere with and censor those views. We 
cannot stand for this cancel culture 
and the interference with free speech.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1866 
April 12, 2021 
Entrepreneurs 
want 
to 
challenge 
these big tech companies. Unfortu-
nately, the system is rigged against 
the little-guy startup. These companies 
can remove your website from the 
internet, delete your app from the app 
store, and permanently ban you from 
their platforms. These companies can 
also remove competitors or those they 
disagree with, largely with no recourse. 
Millions of small business owners use 
tech platforms to operate their busi-
ness. It has been a big boost to our 
economy over the last 25 years. Many 
business owners have been censored, 
banned, and demonetized. This can be 
done without warning, no explanation 
whatsoever, and many times without 
any meaningful due process. 
Our antitrust regulators need to take 
a harder look at the actions of Big 
Tech. I recently introduced legislation 
with Senator KLOBUCHAR to increase 
resources for FTC and DOJ antitrust 
enforcement. This legislation would 
provide an immediate boost to these 
Agencies’ effective competition respon-
sibilities. 
Right now, there are essentially five 
companies 
within 
just 
the 
United 
States that determine what can and 
cannot be viewed by the American pub-
lic. It is becoming increasingly clear 
that these companies are more be-
holden to cancel culture and not to the 
free speech principles that this country 
was founded upon. 
When I talk about what these Agen-
cies—the FTC and the DOJ—ought to 
be doing, I am not excluding anything 
that this Congress ought to be doing 
beyond what these Agencies have a re-
sponsibility to do. 
So I go back to a famous quote by 
Justice Brandeis: 
If there be time to expose through discus-
sion the falsehoods and fallacies, to avert the 
evil by the processes of education, the rem-
edy to be applied is more speech, not en-
forced silence. 
It is time that we examine the need 
for section 230 immunity—that is be-
yond what we expect the DOJ and FTC 
to do—examine the need for section 230 
immunity and to what extent these 
tech companies are abusing their mo-
nopoly power. It is time that these 
companies stop arbitrarily deciding 
what speech is acceptable for our coun-
try and the 335 million Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
was grateful for the opportunity, as I 
am sure we all were, to be back home 
for the last 2 weeks for the State work 
period and to talk to our constituents. 
Some of my conversations—and I sus-
pect I am not alone—some of these con-
versations were virtual. But most of us 
are glad to get back to whatever the 
next normal is and have more and more 
human interaction rather than the iso-
lation and, frankly, some of the anx-
iety that comes along with being kept 
apart. We are social animals, we 
human beings, and we thrive on and 
we, I believe, need that kind of inter-
action. But so far this year, most of it 
has been virtual. 
I did have a chance to speak to the 
Texas Hispanic Chamber members and 
the members of the U.S. Hispanic 
Chamber as part of their annual legis-
lative summit. Like many of the folks 
who do fly-ins at least once a year, we 
have had to forgo that, so this was a 
virtual meeting. But I did get a chance 
to hear from many of the members and 
particularly their board members on 
the importance of our response to the 
pandemic and the progress they have in 
turn been able to make through things 
like the Paycheck Protection Program. 
I also was able to join friends from 
Webb County—that is Laredo, TX—the 
North American Development Bank 
and their private partners, to announce 
a $216 million investment in a new 
solar farm, which they are very excited 
about. 
I was glad to be able to visit with a 
number of Texans in person, with all of 
the appropriate safety precautions we 
have all learned so well. 
I was able to kick off National Vol-
unteer Month at the San Antonio Food 
Bank with a number of incredible non-
profits and people with big hearts who 
are volunteering even amidst the— 
hopefully the waning days of this pan-
demic, at the food bank. I hope Texans 
and folks all across the country will 
continue to find ways to support one 
another by volunteering with local 
nonprofits this month and into the fu-
ture. 
I also was able to meet with venue 
owners and operators at Antone’s in 
Austin, which is the live music capital 
of the world, on the day before applica-
tions opened for the U.S. Small Busi-
ness Administration shuttered venue 
operators grant. This grant program 
was established through the Save Our 
Stages Act, which Senator KLOBUCHAR 
and I introduced and which was signed 
into law as part of the December relief 
bill. These small venues were excluded 
from the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram and, of course, were among the 
first to close and will be among the 
last to open. But what we did in the 
Save Our Stages Act will go a long way 
to ensure that the marquees at our 
most 
beloved 
live 
entertainment 
venues can shine bright once again, 
and I am eager for the funds to reach 
Texas venues. 
Then, in Dallas, I joined my friend 
Congresswoman EDDIE BERNICE JOHN-
SON to announce bipartisan legislation 
we are introducing in response to the 
deadly winter storm that hit Texas last 
February. This legislation will help 
build resilience in our electrical infra-
structure throughout the country and 
will help ensure we are better prepared 
for whatever extreme weather Mother 
Nature sends our way. 
It was great, as I said, to visit with 
folks in person again, and I am glad to 
see a gradual return to our new nor-
mal, as more and more Americans are 
vaccinated. 
Even though the issues I was dis-
cussing throughout my State were dif-
ferent, one common theme that I 
brought up everywhere I went was to 
continue to encourage Texans to get 
vaccinated. So far, 9 million of us have 
received at least 1 dose of the vaccine, 
and 5.6 million Texans are fully vac-
cinated. Obviously we are not out of 
the woods yet, but Americans have 
every reason to be optimistic about the 
headway made in the fight against 
COVID–19. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Unfortunately, just as we are seeing 
progress on the pandemic, we are see-
ing another crisis on our border. 
In February, Customs and Border 
Protection 
encountered 
more 
than 
100,000 migrants along our southern 
border—the highest total since 2006. 
Last month, things continued to trend 
in the wrong direction. CBP encoun-
tered more than 172,000 migrants along 
our border, which is the highest in two 
decades. 
Put simply, our immigration system 
cannot accommodate this many mi-
grants coming at one time. We lack the 
personnel, the facilities, the resources, 
and the policies to efficiently process 
these migrants to make sure those 
with valid claims, say, for asylum are 
protected and to provide quality care 
to all of those in our custody in the 
meantime. That is true for adults and 
family units but especially for the 
alarming number of unaccompanied 
children. 
In the summer of 2014, we saw a simi-
lar spike of children arriving at our 
border, which President Obama called a 
‘‘humanitarian crisis.’’ It absolutely 
was. Between October 2013 and Sep-
tember 2014, more than 68,500 unaccom-
panied children entered the United 
States. We are only halfway through 
fiscal year 2021 and are already reach-
ing that total, with more than 48,500 
migrant children having crossed our 
border just in the last 6 months. Nearly 
19,000 of these children came last 
month alone, the highest monthly 
total on record. Putting that in per-
spective, almost 19,000 children in 1 
month is roughly enough to fill every 
seat in the AT&T Center in San Anto-
nio, where the San Antonio Spurs play. 
There 
are 
grave, 
cascading 
con-
sequences to this flow of humanity 
coming across our border. It obviously 
impacts these children as well as the 
communities and organizations that 
care for them. And, of course, the 
criminal organizations that smuggle 
people into the country, along with il-
licit drugs, are getting richer in the 
process. 
Over the last several weeks, I have 
spent time in these communities that 
are managing this crisis to learn more 
about the challenges they face. Last 
month, my friend HENRY CUELLAR, a 
Congressman from Laredo, TX, and I 
visited the Carrizo Springs Influx Care 
Facility, which is one of the shelters 
that house young boys aged 13 through 
17. We heard from the men and women

who run the shelter, as well as stake-
holders in Laredo, elected officials, and 
other NGO representatives. We heard 
from them about the mounting chal-
lenges of this crisis. 
I visited three additional facilities in 
Midland, Dallas, and Houston during 
this last work period, and I saw the in-
credible ways that these communities 
and the nongovernmental associations 
are caring for migrant children. 
Let me just say, we all recognize our 
obligation to treat these children and 
these migrants humanely while they 
are here in our country, but we also 
need to make sure that our laws are 
equally enforced on a fair basis and 
that people who come this way don’t 
jump ahead of people who have been 
waiting patiently in line to come into 
the United States through legal means. 
Just before the State work period 
started, Senator CRUZ and I hosted 17 
of our fellow Republican colleagues in 
the Senate down at the Rio Grande 
Valley. I was pleased when I heard 
from my friend HENRY CUELLAR that he 
had hosted JOE MANCHIN, the Senator 
from 
West 
Virginia, 
and 
JOHN 
HICKENLOOPER, the Senator from Colo-
rado. I am glad that Members of both 
parties are coming down to learn for 
themselves and to listen to the experts 
I depend on to give me good informa-
tion. 
We saw the facility in Donna and 
learned about the challenges created 
by such a high volume of unaccom-
panied children. For folks who don’t 
live in a border State or haven’t spent 
much time in our border communities, 
it is important to see the situation 
firsthand and to learn from those ex-
perts whom I mentioned a moment ago. 
I have worked with folks in the Rio 
Grande Valley throughout my time in 
the Senate to ensure that these com-
munities are safe, prosperous, and vi-
brant places to live. These men and 
women have valuable insight for all of 
us into the policies that have led to 
this crisis and the ones we need to put 
in place to turn things around. I appre-
ciate these experts who spent time 
sharing their feedback with all of us 
who have been interested enough to 
travel to the border and the colleagues 
who visited there. I am glad our col-
leagues were able to see and learn more 
about the unique challenges facing 
these communities and our Nation 
when it comes to uncontrolled, over-
whelming masses of humanity. 
To read news stories about the thou-
sands of children who are brought to 
the United States alone is heart-
breaking. To see their faces, though, 
and learn more about the devastating 
circumstances in which they were 
brought here is also nothing short of 
heartbreaking. 
At the Kay Bailey Hutchison Conven-
tion Center in Dallas, which is now 
serving as a shelter for 2,300 young 
boys, I heard from one young boy who 
arrived in the United States after a 3- 
month trek from Central America on 
foot. He told us that he spent time hid-
ing in jungles along the way and that 
food was scarce through much of their 
journey. As you could imagine, he was 
happy to be at a safe shelter receiving 
three square meals a day. He was un-
derstandably 
soft-spoken 
about 
his 
long and treacherous journey, and I am 
sure he experienced hardships that you 
and I could hardly imagine—certainly 
circumstances we would never want 
our children or grandchildren to expe-
rience. 
Last week, some truly disturbing al-
legations came out about abuse in one 
of the temporary facilities in San An-
tonio. As I said, these children have ar-
rived in our country after a perilous 
journey. Many arrive sick, malnour-
ished, and having endured abuse, in-
cluding assault, along the way. The 
fact that any of these forms of abuse 
could continue while under the care of 
the U.S. Government is despicable. I 
have called on the inspector general of 
Health and Human Services to fully in-
vestigate these allegations of sexual 
assault in this facility at the Freeman 
Coliseum. I hope the administration 
will support our efforts to get to the 
bottom of what happened and ensure 
that no child is ever subjected to any 
level of mistreatment while in our 
care. 
The real kicker in all of this is that 
as all of this is unfolding, the coyotes, 
the smugglers, and the cartels that 
bring these children to our border are 
getting richer and richer and richer. 
Border Patrol said it is common for 
families to pay thousands of dollars to 
the coyotes to bring children to Amer-
ica. With nearly 19,000 caught last 
month alone, it is easy to see how prof-
itable this business is. 
Let’s say the cartels charge $5,000 a 
head—a low estimate based on some of 
the figures I have seen. That would 
mean these criminals brought in nearly 
$100 million in revenue in March alone 
just from smuggling children. These 
cartels’—these transnational criminal 
organizations—tactics include dropping 
children as young as 3 years old over 
the top of a 14-foot segment of the bor-
der wall or allowing a 6-month-old 
child to be thrown from a raft into the 
Rio Grande River to divert Border Pa-
trol while they attempt a rescue so 
they can get on their way. 
This has to stop. We can get into an 
argument about who is to blame, but 
that doesn’t change the more impor-
tant matter about who has the power 
to stop it. 
First, President Biden needs to ac-
knowledge the scope of this crisis and 
commit to addressing it along with us 
in the Congress. All we have gotten 
from the White House so far are state-
ments telling migrants now is not the 
time to come, as if they would let ev-
eryone know when the time to come is 
appropriate. 
Two weeks ago, President Biden 
tasked Vice President Harris to lead ef-
forts to address this crisis, and I 
thought this was a sign that the ad-
ministration was finally ready to take 
some informed action. But the Vice 
President has not made a single trip to 
the border yet, and there is not even 
one on the horizon. Then she seemed to 
walk back—that, no, her assignment 
wasn’t at the border; it was to engage 
in diplomacy with countries in Central 
America. 
Simple statements urging people not 
to come are meaningless when all of 
the policies represent a flashing green 
light. That is especially true when Cen-
tral Americans hear messages from 
their family and friends who have made 
it to America that the door is wide 
open and they will be let in. 
The administration must take action 
and implement policies that discourage 
parents from sending their children on 
this perilous and dangerous journey in 
the hands of human smugglers and 
criminals into the United States. 
We have a big role to play too. Immi-
gration reform has been one of my 
greatest frustrations throughout my 
time here. Previous attempts to make 
lasting changes led to bills that were 
so big that they crumbled under their 
own weight. I hope we can all agree 
that this is not the time to repeat that 
history. We need to take action to ad-
dress the crisis at hand now, without 
extraneous matters that could be and 
should be changes made down the line. 
I am working with some of my Demo-
cratic colleagues to achieve this end, 
and I am eager to share more details 
soon. 
Republicans and Democrats must 
work together to address this crisis 
and to bring order out of chaos and to 
protect the innocent children who are 
being harmed. 
Legal immigration has been one of 
the cornerstones of our great country 
throughout our history. Legal immi-
gration is generous, it is safe, it is or-
derly, and it is fair. Illegal immigra-
tion and the horrors that it brings 
along with it, some of which we learned 
about on our recent trips to the border, 
are not humane. They dishonor the 
willingness of the people who want to 
come to the country legally, who wait 
patiently in line, by jumping ahead of 
them in line. But, as I said, the cartels 
and human smugglers know our laws 
and our vulnerabilities better than we 
do, and they are exploiting it each and 
every day. We have to bring it to an 
end. 
I yield the floor.

INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am here on the floor of the Senate this 
evening to talk about our shared na-
tional priorities for addressing the Na-
tion’s infrastructure needs and my con-
cerns—really deep concerns—about the 
plan the Biden administration has out-
lined and specifically the way they in-
tend to pay for it. 
I don’t think there is a single Mem-
ber in this Chamber who does not rec-
ognize the need for us to invest in up-
grading America’s aging infrastruc-
ture. Our network of roads, bridges,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1868 
April 12, 2021 
ports, railroads, and more has played 
an integral role over the decades in 
growing our world-class economy. Yet, 
according to a 2019 report, the most re-
cent one we have from the World Eco-
nomic Forum, the United States now 
ranks only 13th in the world in infra-
structure based on factors like the 
quality of our roads, how efficient our 
trains are, and access to electricity and 
water. 
So we can and should do more to im-
prove our infrastructure, particularly 
as competitors like China make sub-
stantial investments in their own in-
frastructure every year. We can do so 
in a bipartisan way, just as we have al-
ways done. In fact, last Congress, the 
Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee approved bipartisan infra-
structure legislation by a unanimous 
vote of 21 to 0. That was just last Con-
gress, 21 to 0. This bipartisan approach 
last Congress totaled $287 billion—a 
substantial amount and one we have 
yet to figure out how to pay for. 
The current Transportation bill that 
is in play, the so-called infrastructure 
bill from a few years ago, is about $310 
billion. Yet, even as we have to figure 
out how to fund the bipartisan $287 bil-
lion package for roads and bridges from 
last year—a substantial amount in its 
own right—the Biden administration 
recently introduced its own infrastruc-
ture plan that totals $2.7 trillion, al-
most 10 times as much. 
At the core of this Biden administra-
tion proposal is $620 billion in infra-
structure broadly defined. It has a gen-
erous definition of the roads, bridges, 
and other physical transportation and 
water components that have tradition-
ally been considered infrastructure. So 
a generous definition would be that out 
of the $2.7 trillion, $620 billion could be 
called infrastructure based on the way 
Republicans and Democrats alike have 
always looked at it, and again, that 
would include water, electricity, and 
other forms of transportation, not just 
roads and bridges. So about 20 percent 
of the Biden administration infrastruc-
ture bill actually fits the bill. 
The reason the overall package costs 
$2.7 trillion is because they have in-
cluded a broad set of liberal priorities 
that are a far cry from what has ever 
been defined as infrastructure by either 
Democrats or Republicans. So, I guess, 
knowing the popularity of infrastruc-
ture—and it is popular; people want to 
see their roads and bridges repaired— 
the Biden administration has simply 
redefined the word to include hundreds 
of billions of dollars of spending on pri-
orities like healthcare, Federal office 
buildings and other facilities, research 
and development, electric vehicle man-
ufacturing, and more. 
According to the Biden administra-
tion, paid leave is now infrastructure, 
childcare is now infrastructure, and 
caregiving is now infrastructure. While 
many are worthy causes and should be 
debated and voted on separately, they 
don’t belong in infrastructure bills. 
This approach is troubling to me and, 
I know, to many of my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle because it is a 
continuation of the raw partisanship 
that 
defined 
the 
latest 
COVID–19 
spending package back in March. Rath-
er than work to find good-faith nego-
tiations with Republicans to craft a 
package that can gain bipartisan sup-
port, the Biden administration and 
Senate Democrats apparently are once 
again looking into potentially using 
reconciliation to jam Republicans—to 
pass another trillion-dollar-plus spend-
ing bill with a simple 50-vote majority. 
And, like COVID–19, infrastructure has 
always been bipartisan. So if you can’t 
be bipartisan on COVID–19 and you 
can’t be bipartisan on infrastructure, 
what can you be bipartisan about? 
This partisan approach, by the way, 
is the opposite of what President Biden 
pledged on the campaign trail and in 
his inauguration address. In his inau-
gural address, he talked about the need 
to get back to more bipartisanship and 
urged unity. I agreed with that assess-
ment and said so at the time. 
Unfortunately, he has apparently lis-
tened to the more strident voices in his 
party and has gone down the partisan 
path. As with the $1.9 trillion COVID 
spending package last March, the end 
result could be another spending bill 
that is far higher than it needs to be at 
a time of record debt and deficits and 
another partisan bill that further di-
vides us at a time when we are already 
too divided. In fact, about a quarter of 
the Biden plan is not paid for at all, 
taking us further into debt. 
But even more troubling to me is 
that the Democrats plan to pay for 
roughly $2 trillion of this plan with 
massive tax increases on American 
workers and consumers and by making 
us less competitive in the global econ-
omy. This would completely reverse 
the progress we have made over the 
past few years in making America com-
petitive again. Thanks to the 2017 tax 
reforms that the Biden proposal would 
largely dismantle, in the couple of 
years before COVID–19, we saw record 
growth in jobs and wages, with the low-
est poverty rate since the Federal Gov-
ernment started keeping track of it 60 
years ago. 
In promoting the Biden tax increases, 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Janet 
Yellen 
claims we need to reverse the 2017 tax 
reforms because they encourage busi-
nesses to move jobs out of the country. 
The reality is just the opposite. The 
2017 tax reforms stopped the so-called 
corporate tax inversions, which caused 
American companies to become foreign 
companies and move jobs and invest-
ment out of America because of our un-
competitive tax laws. This happened to 
a number of companies in Ohio and in 
every State, practically, represented in 
this Chamber. 
The 2017 reforms also stopped the 
lockout effect that kept foreign profits 
of 
U.S. 
companies 
overseas. 
They 
weren’t bringing the profits back. In-
stead, $1.6 trillion in overseas earnings 
has come back to the United States 
and was invested right here at home. 
Most importantly for working fami-
lies, 70 percent of the savings from the 
corporate tax cuts went into workers’ 
wages, contributing to 19 straight 
months of wage growth of over 3 per-
cent annually that we enjoyed before 
the pandemic. This wage growth was 
really welcome in my home State Ohio. 
We had lower wages, or flat wages, for 
more than a decade. 
And, by the way, who benefited most 
from this wage increase—19 straight 
months of wage increases? Lower and 
middle-income workers—exactly what 
should have been happening. 
Thanks to the 2017 reforms, the larg-
est U.S. companies also increased their 
domestic research and development ex-
penditures 
by 
25 
percent, 
which 
amounts to $707 billion more R&D. And 
they further increased capital expendi-
tures by 20 percent, aided by this re-
turn of foreign profits. 
All of this U.S. investment, job cre-
ation, and new R&D would be put at 
risk by these proposed tax hikes. Under 
the Biden plan, which we have heard is 
raising the corporate rate from 21 to 28 
percent, in actuality, the combined 
Federal and State corporate rate would 
go from 25.8 percent, where it is now 
when you include the State and Fed-
eral—other countries like China don’t 
have any State income tax on their 
corporations. They just have the Fed-
eral rate. So we would be going from 
25.8 percent—by the way, which is al-
ready above the average of 23.4 percent 
for other developed countries, so-called 
OECD countries—it would go from 25.8 
percent up to a staggering 32.8 percent, 
the highest rate in the developed 
world. 
Our tax rate would once again be 
higher than China’s and higher than 
any country in the developed world— 
Japan, Europeans. This is exactly what 
we got away from in 2017, and it was on 
a bipartisan basis. There was a con-
sensus for us to do that—maybe not the 
exact rate, but the idea was to make 
America competitive again. 
I cochaired a task force with a fellow 
Senator, a Democrat from the across 
the aisle, CHUCK SCHUMER, on the Fi-
nance Committee, and we came up with 
this idea of saying: Let’s go to a terri-
torial-type tax system, and let’s lower 
the rate so that we can be competitive 
around the world. That is what hap-
pened, and it is working. 
Now, for some reason, the Biden ad-
ministration says: We want to reverse 
all that. These abrupt tax hikes, which 
actually would be five times as large as 
the corresponding corporate tax cuts in 
2017, would make our workers and our 
businesses less competitive globally at 
a time when our economy is just start-
ing to recover. 
The Biden plan goes well beyond just 
making our tax rates uncompetitive 
again. It also doubles the tax on so- 
called global intangible low-taxed in-
come, or GILTI, making it more costly 
for U.S. companies to operate outside 
the United States, more costly than 
any other country’s companies of any

S1869 
April 12, 2021 
developed country in the world. Again, 
it puts us at a competitive disadvan-
tage. It unfairly punishes American 
workers who have their jobs here in 
America, supporting international op-
erations. 
In Ohio, for example, we have Procter 
& Gamble. It is headquartered in my 
hometown. They rely on overseas pro-
duction to serve foreign markets in an 
affordable manner. They are not going 
to ship diapers from here overseas be-
cause it is not cost-competitive. So, for 
the foreign markets, they will make 
diapers in those foreign countries. 
However, by doing so, they employ 
thousands 
of 
Ohioans 
and 
others 
around this country who support those 
international sales. So all the back-of-
fice work, the sales work, the research 
and development, and so on is done 
here. The proposed Biden tax increases 
would make such companies uncom-
petitive overseas, resulting in our los-
ing markets there and losing U.S. jobs. 
Remember, no other developed country 
in the world does this except us. No 
other country taxes these companies 
on their foreign profits. We got away 
from that on purpose, and we essen-
tially established a minimum tax, 
which, again, hardly any country in 
the world has, but we wanted to have 
some balance here. 
Now, under this proposal from the 
Biden administration, that tax would 
be more than double. It is going to hurt 
us. The Biden administration also pro-
poses to eliminate a provision regard-
ing what is called foreign-derived in-
tangible income, FDII. In 2017, we put 
FDII in place for a very simple reason, 
and there seemed to be a consensus 
about that, which is to provide a carrot 
to U.S. companies to do their research 
and development here in America. It 
incentivized companies to bring that 
research back and to keep that re-
search here. It worked to create high- 
skilled and high-wage jobs. 
For example, Google, Cisco, and 
Facebook brought all of their intellec-
tual property home—brought all of 
their IP home. And we heard from 
other U.S. companies like Intel and 
Disney, which said they kept their IP 
in the United States due to this tax 
law change. Why would we want that 
to go overseas? 
The 
Biden 
administration 
claims 
that it wants the United States to be 
more competitive, yet these proposed 
tax increases do just the opposite. It 
makes no sense that while China and 
other countries are increasing sub-
sidies to businesses that innovate, the 
United States would be punishing our 
workers and global companies, making 
them less competitive. 
In what amounts to an astounding 
admission of how deeply flawed these 
proposals are, when Treasury Sec-
retary Janet Yellen announced the pro-
posal to increase taxes we just talked 
about, she actually went out of her way 
to make a plea to other countries 
around the world. She asked them to 
raise their own corporate tax rates and 
to increase their own taxes to ensure, 
as she said, a more level playing field. 
Understanding the nature of the in-
tense global competition, our competi-
tors are doing just the opposite. It is 
naive to think that because we are 
going to raise our taxes and ask them 
to do the same that they would do 
that. They want more of the jobs and 
investment in their country. 
In fact, just this past week, the Fi-
nance Minister of Ireland, when asked 
about this, said they have no interest 
in raising taxes. Ireland is one of those 
countries that has made themselves 
competitive and resulted in our tax law 
changes because they were taking jobs 
away from us, and now we were bring-
ing this IP and these jobs back. Ire-
land, China, and these other countries 
are going to continue to lower barriers 
to attract capital and jobs. It is wishful 
thinking, at best, to think that be-
cause we are going to raise our taxes, 
they are going to raise theirs. 
The Biden plan would mean America 
standing alone atop the corporate tax 
rate chart among all developed coun-
tries—standing alone, leaving our busi-
nesses and workers to suffer the cost, a 
fact borne out from multiple studies, 
including from the nonpartisan Con-
gressional Budget Office that shows it 
is workers who bear most of the burden 
of higher taxes in the form of lower 
wages and lost jobs. It is not the cor-
porations; it is the workers. 
As I said before, there is a clear need 
for us to reinvest in American infra-
structure. I think we can all agree with 
that. Republicans and Democrats alike 
want to do it, and, right now, in the 
key committee of jurisdiction, by the 
way, the Senate Environment and Pub-
lic Works Committee, bipartisan nego-
tiations are ongoing. This is the same 
committee that had a unanimous vote 
last Congress on the transportation 
legislation. 
They are talking right now about 
how to put together a bipartisan pack-
age. That is the right way to do it: Go 
through regular order and allow Demo-
crats and Republicans alike to offer 
their ideas. 
There is also a group of Republicans 
and Democrats outside of the com-
mittee who have met and are looking 
for a more sensible way forward. I am 
among that group. There are others as 
well. 
The partisan approach by the Biden 
administration looks to be taking us 
down the road of another trillion-dol-
lar-plus 
spending 
package 
jammed 
through Congress with no support from 
the other side of the aisle. That is not 
good for this institution. It is not good 
for this country. It is not the way to 
get things done. 
Instead of a $2.7 trillion plan that 
goes beyond any reasonable definition 
of infrastructure and is mostly paid for 
with a devastating tax hike on U.S. 
workers and our economy, let’s do 
what we know works: a bipartisan ap-
proach focused on what we have all 
agreed 
is 
infrastructure—roads, 
bridges, ports, rail, broadband, and 
other true infrastructure. 
I believe if we take that more tar-
geted approach, we can build on the bi-
partisan framework this Congress has 
achieved in recent years and work to-
gether to find commonsense ways to 
fund infrastructure legislation, includ-
ing user fees, which is what we have al-
ways used in the past, without resort-
ing to partisan tax hikes, which reduce 
the competitiveness of U.S. workers, 
U.S. companies, and undermine invest-
ment in our country. I hope we take 
that better approach. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, we have just listened to Senator 
PORTMAN, and you are hearing others 
of us on the Republican side of the 
aisle talk about the elevated levels of 
spending and how our Democratic col-
leagues have seemed to lose touch with 
the American people. This is something 
that appears to have happened at light-
ning speed. 
It really began on the very first day 
of the Biden administration. It started 
with the stroke of a pen and a stream 
of Executive orders. On Day 1, Presi-
dent Biden made a decision that he 
would weaken our border, and with 
that stroke of a pen, he destroyed hun-
dreds—hundreds, thousands—of good- 
paying union jobs right in the middle 
of a pandemic, and that was by elimi-
nating the Keystone Pipeline. With 
every decision, he has made it abun-
dantly clear that he came back to 
Washington not to serve this country 
but to advance an agenda pushed by 
the most radical leftwing of the Demo-
cratic Party. 
That being said, the White House has 
a problem because the American people 
have figured out what they are up to, 
and as I have been home for the past 
couple of weeks, I have talked to 
Tennesseeans from every political divi-
sion. They are Democrats, Republicans, 
Independents; they are unaffiliated; 
and they are concerned citizens. It 
bothers them, what they are seeing 
from this White House. How could they 
not have, after seeing Senate Demo-
crats spend $1.9 trillion on coronavirus 
relief that spent just 9 percent of that 
pricetag on testing and healthcare 
jobs? If that didn’t do it, President 
Biden surely ticked them off when he 
nominated a Health and Human Serv-
ices Secretary with no healthcare expe-
rience—zero—and a Homeland Security 
Secretary who believes that we should 
have unsecured borders. You cannot 
make this up. People are astounded 
with this. 
So when people back home in Ten-
nessee saw President Biden’s latest 
proposal for a $2 trillion so-called in-
frastructure bill, they weren’t particu-
larly shocked to see that very little of 
this legislation has to do with infra-
structure. 
Just 3 months into the new adminis-
tration and already they know that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1870 
April 12, 2021 
this is just another vehicle for the 
left’s wish list. 
The most frustrating thing about it 
is that Tennesseans have repeatedly 
told me that a smart, targeted plan to 
fund 
infrastructure 
improvements 
would make a tremendous difference in 
local communities and in our State. 
They support that type of investment. 
They want to see that. Roads, bridges, 
waterways, highways, broadband, air-
ports, they are for that. What they 
don’t support is an administration that 
repeatedly promises one thing and then 
chooses to do the opposite. 
Just like last month’s over-the-top 
spending bill, this month’s multitril-
lion-dollar boondoggle isn’t just a 
waste of taxpayer dollars; it is a missed 
opportunity to rebuild parts of our 
economy that were struggling to keep 
up before the pandemic hit. 
Here is a number for your talking 
points: Less than 6 percent. And what 
is less than 6 percent? That is the 
amount, that is the percentage of this 
$2 trillion bill that actually goes to in-
frastructure projects—less than 6 per-
cent. 
Tennesseans are asking me: How 
could this possibly happen? We have 
been talking about having an infra-
structure bill now for about 3 years, 
and you bring a bill forward—the 
Democratic leadership does—and less 
than 6 percent goes to infrastructure. 
Now, this sounds like a familiar tac-
tic: Redefine your standards, put less 
than 10 percent of your funding toward 
your stated purpose, then throw the 
rest into yet another handout for 
projects that would not stand a chance. 
They 
wouldn’t 
have 
a 
snowball’s 
chance of receiving public support on 
their own, much less 60 votes here in 
this Chamber. 
President Biden’s American jobs plan 
ignores rural Tennesseans who have to 
navigate flood plains to get to work or 
to get to school. It bypasses crumbling 
bridges they can’t avoid, but it sure 
does pay a lot of attention to Green 
New Deal policies that were non-
starters even before Speaker PELOSI 
lost ground in the House. 
Climate change studies and union 
payouts take precedent over roads, 
bridges, ports, airports, and waterways. 
In fact, this absurd scheme spends 
more taxpayer money on electric cars 
than on all of those things combined. 
Yes, you heard me correctly. This so- 
called infrastructure bill spends more 
money, more of your hard-earned tax 
dollars, on electric cars than on all of 
the roads, bridges, highways, ports, air-
ports, and waterways. That is correct. 
Another day, another power grab 
made worse by job-destroying, cor-
porate tax increases that will put 
American companies at a global dis-
advantage. It is no wonder Democrats 
have been working overtime to stretch 
the definition of ‘‘infrastructure’’ past 
the point of reason. 
These days, entire White House press 
briefings rely on the idea that the defi-
nition of ‘‘infrastructure’’ will con-
tinue to evolve—as they say, it is going 
to evolve—to make it include whatever 
the Democrats decide that it should in-
clude. It is a time-honored liberal trick 
that has run its course. 
They can tweet that lie every day for 
the next 4 years if they choose, but 
here in the real world, we are dealing 
with an economy still in recovery, 
major industries in crisis, and millions 
of families who are working terribly 
hard and long hours to just make ends 
meet. 
What we are seeing here isn’t just a 
disconnect. This is an administration 
attempting to impose their socialist vi-
sion on a country that cannot sustain 
the cost. 
To my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, I want to be clear. That vi-
sion of America that you have invented 
to fulfill this purpose does not exist. It 
is time to come up for air and talk a 
little reality. 
I know it is a popular thing here in 
Washington to claim that elections 
have consequences, but on your first 
day back in power, the Democratic 
Party got together and marched right 
across the line that separates con-
sequences from punishment. Punish-
ment, that is what they are all about. 
I would also encourage my Demo-
cratic colleagues to remember that 
when they do this, when they put to-
gether these trillion-dollar handouts 
for radical special interests, political 
pain for their opponents isn’t the only 
result. They are punishing their neigh-
bors, their friends, communities that 
are in their States. They are making 
life harder, much more difficult, for 
local businesses and small business 
manufacturers, and they are exposing 
our weaknesses to our adversaries. 
I will tell you, if President Biden and 
the majority leader shove yet another 
blank check through this Chamber, 
they are going to find out in a hurry, I 
really do believe, how little the Amer-
ican people have to give for their left-
ist agenda. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

AMAZON UNION DRIVE 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, on Fri-
day, Amazon, one of the world’s largest 
corporations, successfully crushed the 
most recent union drive at one of their 
warehouses, where workers were orga-
nizing for a voice on the job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1871 
April 12, 2021 
Let’s be clear: This was never a fair 
fight. 
Amazon is perhaps the world’s most 
powerful corporation. It would not be 
raking in profits without the hard 
work and dedication of its hundreds— 
hundreds of thousands of American 
workers. Yet Amazon unleashed all 
that corporate power to fight those 
same workers. 
They harassed employees with anti- 
union propaganda. They sent mis-
leading text messages, websites, and 
fliers. Workers reported they didn’t 
even get enough time for bathroom 
breaks in the warehouse. That is how 
intense the company’s pressure is. And 
yet, when they are able to use the 
bathroom during this union fight, even 
there workers are hit with anti-union 
propaganda fliers on the stall doors. 
Amazon demanded the U.S. Postal 
Service install a mailbox onsite at the 
warehouse so they could monitor em-
ployees mailing their union election 
ballots. It is all part of a pattern for 
Amazon. 
In 2019, Amazon fired a Staten Island 
warehouse 
worker 
who 
called 
for 
unionization. 
Amazon monitors employees’ online 
communications. Last fall we learned 
the company planned to spend hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars for new 
software to monitor ‘‘threats’’ like 
unions. Amazon isn’t alone. This union 
busting is standard operating proce-
dure for most companies. 
A growing number of Americans 
want to join unions. A recent poll 
found that about half of Americans 
would like to join a union if they 
could. Millennials are the most pro- 
worker, 
pro-union 
generation 
since 
World War II. The Center for Economic 
Policy and Research reported that 75 
percent of new union members are 
under the age of 35. 
I talked to one of those union work-
ers at the end of last month. I spoke to 
Kate from Zanesville, OH, who joined 
UFCW—United Food and Commercial 
Workers—not too long ago. We talked 
about the work she and I and others did 
to save her future pension in the rescue 
plan, how her union had helped her 
learn about retirement security and 
helped her fight for her retirement se-
curity. 
So if all those workers, especially 
young workers, want to join a union, if 
they want to have a voice on the job, 
they want to have more control over 
their work lives, why aren’t more 
union drives successful? 
Pretty important question to ask, 
pretty obvious answer—because cor-
porations have so much power. 
One union organizer told a reporter 
for the Huffington Post: 
When people hear there’s an election, they 
think everybody gets to vote, there’s a se-
cret ballot, and so on. What they don’t un-
derstand— 
What the public doesn’t understand 
about union elections— 
is that the company has access to the work-
ers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and has 
enormous influence over their lives. 
If they care to use that influence, 
and so often they do, here is what he 
said: 
They can threaten. They can give a raise. 
They can demote. They can grant favors. 
Or they cannot grant favors. 
Every worker knows that. 
This is what workers organizing are 
up against. There is nothing close, 
nothing at all resembling a level play-
ing field for American workers. 
That is why we need the PRO Act, 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act. 
It is a comprehensive overhaul of our 
labor laws to protect workers’ right to 
stand together and to bargain for fair 
wages and better benefits and safer 
workplaces. 
It would level the playing field and 
finally, finally give workers a fighting 
chance against corporate union-busting 
tactics like we saw from Amazon. 
We know what has happened in this 
country. We know we have seen—we 
have seen worker productivity go up. 
We have seen corporate profits go up. 
We have seen executive compensation 
skyrocket upward. Yet worker wages 
are flat. 
Passing the PRO Act would strength-
en the punishment against companies 
that violate workers’ rights to organize 
and that retaliate against union orga-
nizers. 
It would close loopholes that allow 
employers to misclassify their employ-
ees as supervisors and independent con-
tractors to avoid paying their fair 
share and to avoid giving workers the 
benefits they have earned and that 
they deserve. 
A union card is a ticket to a middle- 
class life when you fight for economic 
justice by making it available for all 
workers. We just need corporations to 
get out of the way, to be neutral, to let 
workers organize and take control over 
their careers and their futures. 
We also need to empower all workers, 
whether they have chosen to join a 
union or not. 
That means paid family and medical 
leave for all workers. It means a living 
wage for all workers. It means retire-
ment security for all workers. It means 
power over your life and your schedule. 
It means overtime pay when you earn 
it. It means healthcare for all workers. 
It is, all in the end, about the dignity 
of work. 
Remember what Dr. King said; that 
‘‘no labor is really menial unless you 
are not getting adequate wages.’’ 
When you love this country, you 
fight for the people who make it work. 
That is what union organizers do in the 
face of overwhelming corporate opposi-
tion, like the billionaires at Amazon, 
and it is what all of us must continue 
to do until all work pays off. 
TRIBUTE TO MATT KEYES 
Mr. President, I would like to honor 
a longtime member of my Ohio staff, 
Matt Keyes. Matt’s last day in our of-
fice is tomorrow before he moves on to 
a new opportunity—still in Ohio, still 
serving the people of my State, still 
serving the State that he and I both 
love. 
Matt has been with our office for 7 
years, working with Ohio reporters to 
inform the public, traveling the State 
with me to hear from Ohioans. 
We have been to diners and drive- 
throughs. We have done press con-
ferences in front of small businesses 
and schools and bridges. Before the 
pandemic, we spent hours in crowded 
union halls. 
Matt has earned the respect of so 
many Ohio reporters. He understands 
how important their work is to Ohio 
communities. He understands reporters 
and their contribution to democracy, 
something we wouldn’t even have had 
to have bothered saying 5 years ago. 
He knows every news source in Ohio. 
He has built relations with the prin-
cipled, dedicated journalists who run 
them. 
He has a deep understanding of our 
State. Matt knows Ohio as well as any-
one. He went to college here. He stayed 
in Ohio. He dedicates his life to making 
our State a place where other young 
people will want to stay too. 
Some of the most memorable events 
Matt and I have been to together have 
been rallies and meetings with workers 
and retirees around my State, fighting 
to save their pensions. 
It is fitting that Matt ends his time 
in our office with a huge victory for 
Ohio workers—literally, tens and tens 
and tens of thousands of Ohio families 
benefiting from the work we all did to-
gether as activists, that Matt did, that 
my staff did, the rest of my staff that 
we did together in the American Res-
cue Plan to save the pensions that 
Ohioans earned over a lifetime of work. 
Matt got to know these leaders and 
these activists over the years, people 
like Rita Lewis and Mike Walden and 
Dana Vargo. 
He didn’t just listen to their stories 
about what it would mean to their fam-
ilies to lose their retirement security; 
he lifted up their voices. That is what 
somebody like Matt—that is what Matt 
Keyes does. That is what good journal-
ists do. That is what good communica-
tions people do. They listen to their 
stories 
about 
what 
this 
situation 
means to their families. Then they lift 
up their voices; they share those sto-
ries with the media and with the coun-
try. It is how we got Congress to listen. 
It is how we finally got that done. That 
is the lesson of Matt Keyes for young 
reporters, for young journalists, for 
young communications directors, for 
young people who want to make a liv-
ing doing this. 
I will miss Matt on the road in Ohio. 
I know he will continue to serve our 
State. I know he will continue to fight 
for the dignity of work in everything 
that he does. 
Matt, we will miss you.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session for a pe-
riod of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO OFFICERS JACOB 
CARLSON AND RANDI GARRETT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the service and bravery 
of Officer Jacob Carlson and Officer 
Randi Garrett of the Casper Police De-
partment. 
On May 6, 2018, Jake and Randi re-
sponded to a call of children driving a 
car around a dirt lot in Casper near 
Fairdale Avenue. When Officer Garrett 
arrived on scene, she found a 3-year-old 
driving the vehicle with an adult and 
another child in the vehicle. The adult 
was uncooperative in providing identi-
fication and attempted to flee after Of-
ficer Carlson arrived on the scene. 
While Jake attempted to stop the as-
sailant from fleeing, he was shot mul-
tiple times with a concealed weapon. 
Despite being shot with heavy blood 
loss, Officer Carlson returned fire, and 
both officers found cover behind the 
car. Officer Carlson’s firearm was hit 
by gunfire. His actions allowed Officer 
Garrett to find cover and eventually 
expose herself to fire a single shot, ren-
dering the assailant no longer a threat. 
Jake and Randi’s actions were selfless 
and ultimately saved the lives of two 
young children. 
When officers in our community put 
on their uniforms, they know that at 
any time during their shift, they could 
walk into harm’s way. Without hesi-
tation, they still put on their uniform 
every day. This speaks louder than 
words can describe. It speaks to their 
bravery, professionalism, and commit-
ment to the people of Wyoming. 
In 2008, Congress passed the Law En-
forcement 
Congressional 
Badge 
of 
Bravery Act, CBOB, establishing an 
honor for exceptional acts of bravery in 
the line of duty by Federal, State, 
local, and Tribal law enforcement offi-
cers. 
On April 24, 2021, the Wyoming con-
gressional delegation will present Offi-
cers Carlson and Garrett the Congres-
sional Badge of Bravery for their he-
roic actions. It will be a high honor to 
participate in this ceremony. 
I want to thank Officers Carlson and 
Garrett for their exceptional valor on 
this tragic day. The example and pro-
fessionalism they have set will shape 
future generations of police officers 
throughout Wyoming and across our 
great country. 
All of Wyoming and the law enforce-
ment community are so thankful for 
Officer Carlson’s recovery and Officer’s 
Garrett’s resolve. 
REMEMBERING BRIGID 
MCDONOUGH 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 
today I rise in remembrance of my dear 
friend Brigid McDonough. Many years 
ago, she agreed to be the treasurer of 
my Senate campaign and stayed in 
that volunteer job for over a decade. 
That was a courageous thing to do in 
this political climate. But that was the 
kind of friend Brigid was: loyal and al-
ways there. She wanted to serve the 
people. 
She loved her family. She loved her 
husband, Reid. I know how hard it was 
for Reid and Brigid at the end, and the 
last few years the two of them had to-
gether were so precious. Brigid loved 
her extended family of course. I will al-
ways remember being at the Lumber-
jack Days Parade in Stillwater, and 
Brigid would run up and give me a big 
hug—and her sister would run up and 
give me a big hug and then some other 
McDonough would. Her affection was 
contagious. 
Since her admission to the Minnesota 
bar in 1984, her life and career were 
rooted in how she could best lift others 
up. She believed that government and 
the law can be used to help people 
achieve equity and social justice in a 
world where playing fields are not 
often level. She used her impressive 
legal acumen to achieve good things on 
behalf of many people in our State. 
Brigid recognized the power of polit-
ical and community organizing, of get-
ting involved. She was inspired by the 
DFL tradition and the honest convic-
tion to fight for what is just. If you 
asked me what politician she was most 
inspired by, I would have to say Sen-
ator Paul Wellstone. He was her hero. 
Campaigning for Paul is how I first 
met Brigid; She was a true believer, 
happily working at a law firm by day, 
and spending her free time out there 
holding up those green signs for Paul. 
Providing affordable housing to un-
derserved communities was a major 
goal for Brigid, and she approached her 
volunteer work with the same focus 
she had at the law firm. Whether she 
was representing immigrant and ref-
ugee families through her pro bono 
work, supporting her alma mater and 
community 
by 
serving 
on 
the 
Macalester College alumni board and 
the 
Hmong 
Partnership 
board, 
or 
chairing the St. Paul DFL—that alone 
is a career unto itself—Brigid always 
brought this earnest conviction to 
fight for what was good, often on be-
half of people who couldn’t always do it 
for themselves. 
Brigid did so much through the valu-
able guidance she offered to dozens of 
local, State, and national political 
campaigns. She was especially dedi-
cated to electing women and people of 
color to public office, and she was real-
ly good at it. 
Brigid was kind and generous, loyal 
to friends and colleagues, and compas-
sionate, smart, and really funny. She 
and Reid loved traveling and both were 
voracious readers. I always admired 
her adventurous spirit and valued hear-
ing her opinions on everything from 
Minnesota 
politics 
to 
Bruce 
Springsteen. Friends considered her a 
font of wisdom and ideas, and she al-
ways 
shared 
recommendations 
on 
books, movies, and music, with warmth 
and affection. 
There are certain people who have a 
way of seeing and bringing out the very 
best in others. Brigid was one of those 
people. 
Let’s remember Brigid’s fierce love of 
life. That is what made the time we 
spent with her so special. Her friend-
ship and her commitment to making a 
difference in the world are true gifts 
that will continue to benefit all of us 
who were lucky enough to know her. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BARBARA ROGERS 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to recognize my constituent 
and extraordinary Federal employee, 
Ms. Barbara Rogers of Chevy Chase, 
MD, who is retiring from Federal serv-
ice. 
For nearly 20 years, Barbara has 
worked for the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention’s, CDC, Wash-
ington office, advising Agency leader-
ship on critical policy issues, including 
environmental 
health 
and 
public 
health preparedness. A graduate of the 
George Washington University Law 
School, Barbara prosecuted environ-
mental enforcement cases at the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office and served for 8 years 
as counsel to committees of both the 
U.S. Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives. She brought this invalu-
able experience to the Agency for 
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 
ATSDR, a Federal public health Agen-
cy that protects communities from the 
harmful health effects related to expo-
sure to natural and manmade haz-
ardous 
substances. 
When 
ATSDR 
joined CDC’s Washington office in 2002, 
Barbara took on CDC’s environmental 
portfolio 
in 
Washington, 
DC, 
and 
helped shape CDC’s rapidly growing 
preparedness work in the era following 
the attacks of September 11. 
Barbara has served as a CDC liaison 
to Congress, educating policymakers 
and staff to better understand the 
Agency on a variety of important mat-
ters, including in response to congres-
sional oversight on CDC’s laboratories 
and, more recently, on COVID–19. Bar-
bara’s widely sought sage advice and 
diplomatic skills, combined with a 
powerful intellect and attention to de-
tail, have been a critical asset to CDC 
in the Agency’s interactions with GAO 
and Congress. 
With Barbara’s retirement, her CDC 
colleagues will miss her warm friend-
ship and wonderful sense of humor. 
CDC will lose a public servant with a 
moral and ethical grounding, who has 
been a fierce advocate for CDC and pub-
lic health.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO OFFICER ANDY FER-
GUSON 
AND 
DETECTIVE 
RYAN 
KIRKPATRICK 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, at 10 p.m. 
on March 30, 2021, Stanford, KY, Police 
Officer Andy Ferguson and Detective 
Ryan Kirkpatrick were dispatched to 
the parking lot of a local eatery after 
receiving 
a 
911 
call 
from 
Maria 
Vergara, a teenager who witnessed a 
heinous crime: a young woman being 
assaulted and dragged, screaming, into 
the cab of a semitruck. 
Once on the scene, these law enforce-
ment professionals gained access to the 
vehicle, rescued the victim, and even-
tually arrested the 29-year-old perpe-
trator who was later charged with sex-
ual assault and kidnapping. 
Working with SPD Chaplain Jeremy 
Johnson and the Kentucky Cabinet for 
Health and Family Services, the out- 
of-State victim received medical treat-
ment at the hospital and was reunited 
with her family. 
But the story does not stop there. A 
locket containing the ashes of the vic-
tim’s mother had been ripped from her 
neck and discarded during the assault, 
and officers were unable to locate it 
during the night. The next day, Chap-
lain Johnson and Stanford Mayor Dal-
ton Miller returned to the scene and 
eventually found the necklace, which 
has since been returned to the victim. 
These actions remind us all of several 
things: of one person’s ability to 
change the course of history for an-
other—in this case, the teenager who 
reported the crime, of the mix of pro-
fessionalism and heroism that sends 
police officers into unknown but cer-
tain danger; and of the never-give-up 
attitude of our best public servants 
who are moved by compassion to go the 
extra mile for those who are hurting. 
We honor each of these individuals 
today and thank them for their exam-
ple.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING: DAVE’S BIKE SHOP 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a sen-
ior member and former chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship, each month I 
recognize and celebrate the American 
entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting 
the success of a small business in my 
home State of Idaho. Today I am 
pleased to honor Dave’s Bike Shop in 
Idaho Falls as the Idaho Small Busi-
ness of the Month for April 2021. 
Dave’s Bike Shop is a family-owned 
small 
business 
located 
in 
historic 
downtown Idaho Falls. Founded by 
longtime biking enthusiasts David and 
Emily Wilding, the couple saw a need 
for a bike shop in their local commu-
nity and found a small space in the his-
toric downtown area. After months of 
renovations, they opened their doors in 
September of 2011. 
Since its founding, Dave’s Bike Shop 
has been a family effort. Dave and 
Emily’s four sons have been an integral 
part of the shop’s success, working 
after school and through the summers 
to finish two extensive building remod-
els and assist in day-to-day sales and 
service. Through the Wilding family’s 
hard work, the business grew and sales 
increased with each successive year, 
enabling Dave and Emily to relocate to 
a larger facility and expand their serv-
ices. 
Like other small businesses across 
Idaho, Dave’s Bike Shop had to adapt 
to the challenges of the pandemic. 
When global shutdowns closed factories 
and limited access to their supply 
chain, the business quickly changed its 
procurement strategy by sourcing new 
products from other manufacturers and 
placing larger orders whenever pos-
sible. Despite these obstacles, the shop 
has remained successful and continues 
to serve the Idaho Falls community. 
Congratulations to Dave, Emily, and 
all of the employees of Dave’s Bike 
Shop on being selected as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for April 
2021. You make our great State proud, 
and I look forward to your continued 
growth and success.∑

S. RES. 148 
Whereas there are approximately 2,100,000 
retirees of the Armed Forces of the United 
States who have earned their retirement 
through career service, a service-connected 
disability, or both; 
Whereas 
military 
retirees 
show 
an 
unrivaled dedication to service, having faith-
fully served their country and dedicated 
much of their lives knowing that at any mo-
ment they could be sent anywhere in the 
world and possibly asked to make the ulti-
mate sacrifice to protect and defend the na-
tional security of the United States; 
Whereas military retirees, through their 
perseverance and dedication— 
(1) have proven to be leaders who are resil-
ient, focused, disciplined, well-trained, and 
well-educated; and 
(2) bring to lifelong service within their na-
tional and local communities the best quali-
ties of citizens in the United States by being 
dependable, responsible citizens and neigh-
bors; 
Whereas the qualities of a military retiree 
often result in positive contributions to— 
(1) the civilian workforce, as experienced 
and knowledgeable employees; 
(2) local educational institutions, as teach-
ers, counselors, and coaches; 
(3) local government, as elected public 
servants; and 
(4) communities, as dedicated and effective 
volunteers; 
Whereas the dedication and focus of mili-
tary retirees helps strengthen and stabilize 
local communities; and 
Whereas the contributions of military re-
tirees to their communities are the mani-
festation of the desire of the retirees to con-
tinue their selfless acts of volunteering and 
their lifelong service to the United States: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates April 18, 2021, as ‘‘Military 
Retiree Appreciation Day’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to honor the past and continued serv-
ice of military retirees to their local commu-
nities and the United States through appro-
priate ceremonies and other activities.

MATTHEW MARTINEZ 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud students, 
Raelyn Penington, Matthew Martinez and 
Sarah Davis, for earning the Rookie of the 
Year Award for their creative and unique mo-
bile application (app) as part of the 2021 Con-
gressional App Challenge. 
As first-time participants in the challenge, 
this team from Northglenn High School built 
an app entitled ‘‘Identity Protection’’ to assist 
members of the community in preventing iden-
tity theft. 
The students of Northglenn High School 
spent countless hours and used numerous 
tools to learn about coding, developed new 
skills, and further advanced their STEM edu-
cation. Their perseverance and dedication to 
this challenge exemplifies the character and 
determination the faculty instills in the students 
at the school. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
these students for their hard work on this 
project. I am certain these students will exhibit 
the same dedication and character in their fu-
ture accomplishments, and I wish them the 
best of luck going forward.

The bill would Amend federal statutes gov-
erning labor standards and wage discrimina-
tion; Increase civil penalties for violations of 
equal pay provisions; Authorize appropria-
tions for research, education, public out-
reach, and data collection; Restrict employ-
ers’ use of wage, salary, and benefit history, 
and increase their reporting requirements. 
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly 
stem from Authorizing appropriations for 
the Department of Labor and the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission to under-
take various activities to address wage dis-
crimination. 
BILL SUMMARY 
H.R. 7 would revise the equal pay provi-
sions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which 
prohibits wage discrimination on the basis of 
sex; it also would increase civil penalties for 
violations of those provisions. Specifically, 
H.R. 7 would impose higher civil penalties 
for wage discrimination, restrict the use of 
the bona fide factor defense for wage dis-
crimination claims, enhance prohibitions 
against retaliation, and prohibit contracts 
that prevent employees from disclosing their 
wages. It also would prohibit employers from 
relying on wage history in considering a job 
application, seeking an applicant’s wage his-
tory before an offer of employment is made, 
and using wage history to set a new employ-
ee’s wages. Finally, the bill would authorize 
the appropriation of whatever amounts are 
necessary for the Department of Labor 
(DOL) and the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce the 
bill’s provisions and to engage in research, 
outreach, and education. 
ESTIMATED FEDERAL COST 
The estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 7 is 
shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation 
fall within budget functions 500 (education, 
training, employment, and social services) 
and 750 (administration of justice).

Enacting the bill also would increase revenues by an insignificant amount over the 2021–2031 period. 
BASIS OF ESTIMATE 
CBO assumes that the bill will be enacted 
in fiscal year 2021 and that the estimated 
amounts will be appropriated for each fiscal 
year. Estimated spending is based on histor-
ical patterns for similar activities. CBO esti-
mates that under H.R. 7, DOL and the EEOC 
would require total appropriations of $55 mil-
lion, resulting in outlays of $50 million, over 
the 2021–2026 period. 
H.R. 7 would require DOL to undertake 
several activities. Using information from 
the department, and assuming appropriation 
of the estimated amounts, CBO estimates 
that outlays for those activities would total 
$38 million over the 2021–2026 period: 
$22 million for various activities by the Of-
fice of Federal Contract Compliance Pro-
grams, including enforcement and the collec-
tion of employment-related data from fed-
eral contractors; 
$10 million for DOL to conduct research, 
publish educational materials, and sponsor 
educational programs about wage discrimi-
nation; 
$4 million for a program of competitive 
grants for state, local, and community orga-
nizations to train women and girls in nego-
tiation skills; and 
$2 million to establish an annual National 
Award for Pay Equity in the Workplace. H.R. 
7 also would direct the EEOC to provide 
training concerning wage discrimination, 
help small businesses comply with the bill’s 
requirements, and collect wage data from 
certain employers. CBO anticipates that the 
EEOC would investigate more cases than it 
does under current law, and estimates that

training, data collection, and enforcement 
efforts would cost $2.5 million each year for 
total outlays of $12 million over the 2021–2026 
period. 
PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS 
The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 
establishes budget-reporting and enforce-
ment procedures for legislation affecting di-
rect spending or revenues. Enacting H.R. 7 
would increase federal revenues from the col-
lection of new civil penalties. However, CBO 
estimates that those collections would be in-
significant because we expect that the EEOC 
would resolve and collect penalties in only a 
small number of cases. In addition, how em-
ployers would respond to the bill’s provisions 
is uncertain. Revenues could be higher or 
lower depending on those responses. 
INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DEFICITS: 
None. 
MANDATES 
H.R. 7 would impose intergovernmental 
and private-sector mandates as defined in 
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). 
CBO estimates that the cost of the public- 
sector mandate would be below the annual 
threshold for intergovernmental mandates 
established by UMRA ($85 million in 2021, ad-
justed annually for inflation). CBO estimates 
that the aggregate cost of complying with 
the private-sector mandates would exceed 
the annual threshold established in UMRA 
($170 million in 2021, adjusted annually for 
inflation). 
CBO has not reviewed section 2 of H.R. 7 
for 
intergovernmental 
or 
private-sector 
mandates. Section 4 of UMRA excludes from 
the application of that act any legislative 
provisions that would establish or enforce 
statutory rights prohibiting discrimination. 
CBO has determined that section 2 of H.R. 7 
falls within the exclusion because it would 
enforce protections against discrimination 
on the basis of sex, gender, sexual orienta-
tion and identity, pregnancy, and childbirth. 
MANDATE THAT APPLIES BOTH TO PUBLIC AND 
PRIVATE ENTITIES 
Section 9 of the bill would prohibit public 
and private employers from relying on wage 
history in hiring decisions, seeking an appli-
cant’s wage history before an offer of em-
ployment is made, using wage history to set 
a prospective employee’s wages, and retali-
ating against employees for seeking protec-
tions against prohibited actions. 
Those restrictions would not require any 
action by or directly impose any significant 
cost on mandated employers. 
MANDATES THAT APPLY TO PRIVATE-SECTOR 
ENTITIES ONLY 
Section 7 would require the EEOC to issue 
regulations requiring large private-sector 
employers to report data annually on worker 
compensation and on actual hours worked, 
disaggregated by sex, race, and national ori-
gin. In 2016, the EEOC issued a similar rule 
that required employers to report the same 
data. That rule faced legal challenges and 
eventually a court ordered the EEOC to col-
lect the data for 2017 and 2018. In 2019, the 
commission issued a notice that the burden 
on employers was too high and discontinued 
the collection. By putting this requirement 
in statute, H.R. 7 would impose a private- 
sector mandate on employers with 100 em-
ployees or more. 
CBO estimates that about 90,000 private- 
sector employers would be required to com-
ply with the provision at a total annual cost 
in the low hundreds of millions of dollars. 
That cost would be higher in the first year 
because some employers would invest in or 
update software for data collection and man-
agement. CBO based its estimate on the 
data-reporting requirements in the EEOC’s 
2016 rule and on information from other fed-
eral and private-sector sources.

HONORING MAYOR ROBERT BLAIS 
FOR HIS 50 YEARS OF PUBLIC 
SERVICE 
AS 
THE 
MAYOR 
OF 
LAKE GEORGE, NEW YORK 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the longest serving Mayor in 
the United States, Mayor Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Blais, 
in his 50th year as Mayor of Lake George, 
New York. Mayor Blais’ remarkable tenure in 
this position is a testament to the outstanding 
job he has done for the people of Lake 
George, as he continues to hold the utmost 
confidence of the village. 
Mayor Blais has dedicated his storied career 
to serving the community of Lake George in 
many capacities. Before he was consecutively 
elected mayor 13 times, he held numerous 
roles in the community as a village trustee, a 
volunteer assistant fire chief, and a police offi-
cer, earning the appointment to Sergeant. 
Mayor Blais even completed a brief stint as 
the village dog warden. In the years since he 
was first elected to oversee the revitalization 
of the village in 1971, Mayor Blais has cham-
pioned initiatives to build and restore village 
infrastructure, reinvigorate the local economy 
and tourism industry, and preserve the natural 
ecosystem of the lake and surrounding areas. 
The transformation of Lake George into a 
popular and internationally-renowned tourism 
hub can be widely attributed to Mayor Blais’ 
leadership and vision, and his tireless efforts 
to turn that vision into a reality. Always a 
friendly face and the first the welcome visitors 
to the area, Mayor Blais truly embodies the 
neighborly spirit of the North County. Every-
one he meets instantly recognizes him as 
Lake George’s biggest fan, and he does ev-
erything in his power to be accessible and re-
sponsive to his constituents. Mayor Blais is 
known for returning every letter sent to him 
and for taking the time to listen to any and all 
concerns, hoping to resolve them to the best 
of his ability. 
To this day, Mayor Blais remains steadfast 
in his dedication of being a conscientious 
steward of the people and land for which he 
cares, ensuring that Lake George lives up to 
its full potential. His accomplished record on 
public works and his reputation as a ‘‘man of 
the people’’ serve as an inspiration to all New 
Yorkers. On behalf of New York’s 21st Con-
gressional District, I am honored to recognize 
his exceptional leadership and his example as 
a true public servant. 
ORLAND PROJECT TRANSFER ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Orland Project Transfer Act’’ at 
the request of the Orland Water Users’ Asso-
ciation, which operates and maintains this 
Reclamation project in the northern Sac-
ramento Valley. I thank Congressman DOUG 
LAMALFA (R–CA01) for his support as the bill’s 
original cosponsor. 
Our bipartisan bill would transfer ownership 
of the Orland Project—encompassing the East 
Park Reservoir (50,900 acre-feet) in Colusa 
County, the Stony Gorge Reservoir (50,380 
acre-feet) in Glenn County, and approximately 
17 miles of irrigation canals and laterals—from 
the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to a to-be es-
tablished local public agency. The title transfer 
for the Orland Project under our bill mirrors 
the title transfer process for Reclamation 
projects established under the John D. Dingell, 
Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recre-
ation Act (Public Law 116–9). 
The Orland Water Users’ Association would 
be required to first re-incorporate as a local 
public agency under California state law, such 
as a water or irrigation district, to assume title 
to the Orland Project under the bill. Built by 
the federal government over a century ago, 
the Orland Project has been operated and 
maintained locally since 1958 by the Water 
Users’ Association, which repaid its share of 
the Project’s construction costs in 1989. The 
Water Users’ Association believes it is now 
ready to assume legal ownership of the 
Orland Project, and I am pleased to work to 
transfer the Project to full local control. 
The ‘‘Orland Project Transfer Act’’ would 
provide new, dedicated funding to make cap-
ital improvements at the Orland Project, at no 
expense to American taxpayers. First, the bill 
would allow the local public agency (successor 
to the Orland Water Users’ Assortation) to 
keep proceeds from sales of ‘‘excess’’ water 
from the Project to bring the Stony Gorge and 
East Park Dams up to the California Depart-
ment of Water Resources’ dam safety stand-
ards, which are more stringent than the fed-
eral standards Reclamation projects are re-
quired to meet. The U.S. Bureau of Reclama-
tion will only use available funds to satisfy fed-
eral dam safety standards. Second, the bill 
would allow this newly available funding 
source to be used to address public safety 
concerns presented by the Project’s uncov-
ered irrigation canals in the City of Orland. In 
2017, an infant and one of my constituents 
tragically drowned in the Orland Project’s un-
covered irrigation canals near a residential de-
velopment. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to working 
with Chairman GRIJALVA (D–AZ) and all mem-
bers of the House Committee on Natural Re-
sources on this legislative title transfer for the 
Orland Project in my Congressional district. 
RAELYN PENINGTON 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud students, 
Raelyn Penington, Matthew Martinez and 
Sarah Davis, for earning the Rookie of the 
Year Award for their creative and unique mo-
bile application (app) as part of the 2021 Con-
gressional App Challenge. 
As first-time participants in the challenge, 
this team from Northglenn High School built 
an app entitled ‘‘Identity Protection’’ to assist 
members of the community in preventing iden-
tity theft. 
The students of Northglenn High School 
spent countless hours and used numerous 
tools to learn about coding, developed new 
skills, and further advanced their STEM edu-
cation. Their perseverance and dedication to 
this challenge exemplifies the character and 
determination the faculty instills in the students 
at the school. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
these students for their hard work on this 
project. I am certain these students will exhibit 
the same dedication and character in their fu-
ture accomplishments, and I wish them the 
best of luck going forward.

HONORING THE DETERMINATION 
OF YOUNG CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to give praise to one the youngest heroes of 
the 17th District of Illinois, Mr. Christopher 
Taylor of Galesburg. 
We do not always take time to appreciate 
and take lessons from those far younger than 
us, but to everyone here today, I have a les-
son to share that I learned from a boy of 8, 
named Christopher Taylor. Christopher was 
returning to his home in Galesburg with his 
mother and sisters, like any other day, when 
tragedy struck. In ¥15 degree weather, their 
family vehicle hit black ice and plunged into 6 
feet of snow at the bottom of a ditch so deep 
they couldn’t be seen from the road. Stranded 
in the middle of nowhere, they climbed out of 
the car, and realizing they would freeze to 
death if they did nothing, Christopher donned 
a blanket from the backseat and set off in the 
waist-deep snow on a two-mile run to the 
nearest house. Christopher Taylor’s unceasing 
determination saved his family that day. 
When all seemed dark and hopeless, this 
young man laid everything on the line for the 
sake of those he cared about. Even if he 
didn’t know it then, he and his family were be-
ginning to experience the first stages of frost-
bite, every bead of sweat turning into an ice- 
sharpened needle on his skin, and yet he 
never gave up. Christopher reminded me that 
day that what we do for ourselves, dies with 
us, but what we do for others, lives on forever. 
The effort he expended to fight for his family 
made a lasting impact on their world, and he 
was only a boy of 8. He models so perfectly

the level of determination and self-sacrifice we 
all need to be prepared to have during those 
times when those we care about need us. 
Madam Speaker, I’d like to thank Chris-
topher Taylor for reminding us all what it 
means to stand up for those you care about 
with all you have. He is a hero to his family, 
to me, and to the entire Galesburg community 
and I will not soon forget this lesson he’s 
given me.

HONORING 
TWENTY-TWO 
TEACH-
ERS 
OF 
THE 
GREATER 
BOCA 
RATON AREA 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of the twenty-two outstanding teach-
ers in South Florida who have been awarded 
the Teacher of the Year award for 2021 from 
the Rotary Club of Boca Raton Sunrise. 
For more than thirty years, the Rotary Club 
of Boca Raton Sunrise has offered this annual 
distinction to one teacher at each of the twen-
ty-two schools in the greater Boca Raton area. 
Each awardee is selected by the school’s prin-
cipal. These teachers have dedicated their 
time to inspiring, empowering, and bettering 
the next generation of youth in our community. 
Their passion in this effort is truly worthy of 
our recognition. 
These twenty-two exemplary teachers have 
made a profound impact on their students 
through their caring, commitment, and profes-
sionalism. They are a cohort defined by integ-
rity, excellence, and the highest marks in all 
they do. The City of Boca Raton is fortunate 
to have such outstanding faculty. 
Congratulations to Robin Barkes, Lauren 
Jones, Jobi Bailey, Rebecca Santolin, Meghan 
Urbaniuk, Jamie Kshonz, Elizabeth Lean, Kelly 
Urbano, Thomas Simone, Allison Nelson, 
Alana Copeland, Sarah Fulk, Diane Scala, 
Marta Sjovall, Amy Brookes, Jaqueline Stein-
berg, Rachel Ostrow, Rhonda Falk, Cathy Ar-
cher, Christina Feraco, Holly Kline, and Cheryl 
Sollin on being nominated for this year’s

I am pleased to honor them, and I thank 
them for their continued service.

Monday, April 12, 2021 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
this Black History Month, I am celebrating 
Tampa’s health care heroes. I rise today in im-
mense gratitude of a life of service led by 
Heddie Sumpter, whose contributions of her 
time and talents are a living example of self-
less service to others. Born in 1955 in 
Donalsonville, GA, and raised in Detroit, MI, 
where her family worked in the automotive in-
dustry, Heddie moved to Tampa, FL, in the 
1970s to attend the University of South Flor-
ida. She was the first of her 13 siblings to at-
tend college. She completed her associate’s 
degree in management information systems. 
After a short stint back in Detroit, Ms. 
Sumpter returned to Tampa with her daughter 
in the 1980s to stay with her grandmother dur-
ing her remaining years of life. Sadly, her 
grandmother succumbed to lung cancer in 
1989, but this moment opened a new chapter 
in Ms. Sumpter’s life and for the next 30 years 
she would dedicate herself to educating our 
African American population about preventing 
cancer, available resources and reducing 
health disparities through her tireless volun-
teering with the American Cancer Society. 
Ms. Sumpter’s work through the American 
Cancer Society Cancer Action Network spans 
lobbying lawmakers in Tallahassee, FL as well 
as Washington, D.C.; fundraising; awareness 
about economic and cultural barriers to access 
to care and resources; and helping to ensure 
communities of color are included in the mas-
sive, decennial Cancer Prevention Study, 
which has had findings with global implica-
tions, such as establishing the link between 
cigarettes and the risk of lung cancer. Ms. 
Sumpter has been appointed to numerous 
committees of the American Cancer Society at 
the federal, state and local levels, and in 2019 
she received the American Cancer Society 
Volunteer Leadership Award, presented to her 
in Dallas, TX, after a competitive nomination 
process. The expertise she has gained has 
led her to become an outspoken advocate of 
improved health in other areas. I will always 
be grateful to her for standing with me to 
champion the Affordable Care Act so that 
more Americans could have access to afford-
able health care, and not be discriminated 
against if they have a pre-existing condition. 
As a member of the Delta Sigma Theta Soror-
ity, Inc., she serves as its national liaison to 
St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital as well 
as March of Dimes, and has been instru-
mental in forging a national partnership be-
tween the Deltas and the American Cancer 
Society. In addition, she has served as chair 
for the Board of Directors for the Corporation 
to Develop Communities (CDC) of Tampa, Inc. 
and chair of the Hillsborough County Commu-
nity Action Board, both which aim to lift com-
munities. 
Ms. Sumpter now works at her alma mater, 
the University of South Florida, where she has 
also dedicated more than three decades, start-
ing at the Office of the Registrar, then at the 
Colleges of Engineering and Business, and 
now at the College of The Arts as a human re-
sources administrator. Ms. Sumpter is an out-
standing reminder that hard work and service 
to others always lead to progress. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful Na-
tion and the Tampa Bay community, I am 
proud to recognize the service and leadership 
of Heddie Sumpter, and her lifetime dedicated 
to the cause, which inspires us all.

IN HONOR OF THE HONORABLE 
JOHN DANIEL ALLEN 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor and pleasure to extend my per-
sonal congratulations to a great friend and 
servant of humankind, John D. Allen, the 
former Chief Judge of the Chattahoochee Cir-
cuit of the Third Superior Court District of 
Georgia. 
Judge Allen was recently inducted into the 
2020 Georgia Military Veterans Hall of Fame 
on Saturday, April 3, 2021, in John’s Creek, 
Georgia. 
Judge Allen was born on January 17, 1943, 
in segregated Columbus, Georgia. It seemed 
like all the odds were against him of one day 
becoming a Superior Court Judge. Despite the 
lack of black role models in the law as he was 
growing up, Judge Allen kept education as his 
main priority. He graduated from Tuskegee 
University in 1966 with a Bachelor’s degree in 
Mechanical Engineering. A distinguished cadet 
in the ROTC, Judge Allen was commissioned 
into the Air Force in 1966 as a 2nd Lieutenant 
Pilot. He completed Advanced Survival Train-
ing in 1967, and he was promoted to 1st Lieu-
tenant/Tactical Fighter Pilot in 1968. Upon 
completion, he was assigned to Southeast 
Asia and flew 167 combat missions while sta-
tioned in Thailand. After promotions to Tactical 
Aircraft Commander, then to Captain, Judge 
Allen flew another 127 combat missions in 
Southeast Asia before returning to Tampa, 
Florida, and serving as an academic and flight 
instructor until his discharge in July of 1973. 
He left the Air Force as a highly decorated 
pilot, earning 23 Air Medals, 2 Air Force Com-
mendation 
Medals, 
and 
numerous 
other 
awards for his service during the Vietnam 
War. 
In 1975, Judge Allen earned a Juris Doctor 
from the University of Florida. He was admit-
ted to the Georgia bar in 1976. From 1976 to 
1987, he maintained a private law practice in 
the Columbus area. At that time, Judge Allen 
and I were two of only four black lawyers in 
Columbus. 
Judge Allen continued to break barriers 
when he began serving as a Columbus Re-
corder’s Court judge for a year before assum-
ing a position on the State Court for 
Muscogee County in 1987. In 1993, he was 
appointed to the position of Chattahoochee

April 12, 2021 
Judicial Circuit Superior Court Judge where he 
was re-elected repeatedly and served with the 
utmost honor and distinction until his retire-
ment in 2013. 
Judge Allen’s diligent judicial service has 
also been mirrored by his extensive involve-
ment with the local and state communities. In 
conjunction with his professional accomplish-
ments in the Air Force and on the bench, 
Judge Allen has served on a number of 
boards and commissions, most notably as 
Chairman of the Judicial Qualifications Com-
mission, and has received many awards and 
accolades for his service. Judge Allen’s con-
tributions to the Columbus area and the state 
of Georgia have even earned him recognition 
from the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer as one of 
‘‘100 People to Remember for the Century.’’ 
None of Judge Allen’s momentous accom-
plishments would have been possible without 
the enduring love and support of his late wife, 
Victoria; children John Jr., Geoffrey, and 
Kevin; and grandchildren John Ill and Carson. 
A true Georgian devoted to serving his great 
state, Judge Allen embodies Georgia’s state 
motto, ‘‘Wisdom, Justice and, Moderation.’’ 
Judge Allen is a man of great integrity who 
sets a high standard of values that make for 
a strong foundation of character in himself and 
in others. On a personal note, I would like to 
thank Judge Allen for his friendship, advice, 
and counsel over the years. His wisdom and 
sage advice have contributed immensely to 
my success. For that, I will always be grateful. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me, my wife Vivian, and the more than 
730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second Con-
gressional District in extending our sincerest 
congratulations to the Honorable John D. Allen 
for his induction into the 2020 Georgia Military 
Veterans Hall of Fame and for his many years 
of service.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud students, 
Baylee Hughes and Dakota Hull, for earning 
the Best in Show Award for their creative and 
unique mobile application (app) as part of the 
2021 Congressional App Challenge. 
As first-time participants in the challenge, 
this team from the STEM Launch School built 
an app entitled ‘‘Chatroom’’ to create a safe

further advanced their STEM education. Their 
perseverance and dedication to this challenge 
exemplifies the character and determination 
the faculty instills in the students at the school. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
these students for their hard work on this 
project. I am certain these students will exhibit 
the same dedication and character in their fu-
ture accomplishments, and I wish them the 
best of luck going forward. 
HONORING DAVID STARNES 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of David Starnes as he retires 
from a distinguished 32-year career in law en-
forcement with the San Rafael Police Depart-
ment effective March 30, 2021. 
Chief Starnes was born November 27, 1964 
and grew up in Novato, CA. He graduated 
from San Marin High School in 1982 and en-
listed in the U.S. Marine Corps where he 
served for three years. Chief Starnes earned 
an associates degree from Grossmont College 
and his bachelor’s degree from Union Institute 
and University. He was first hired as a police 
officer in 1988 with the San Rafael Police De-
partment where he excelled in numerous as-
signments, including as a Field Training Offi-
cer, Street Crimes Unit member, Sexual As-
sault Detective, SWAT team member and 
Sniper Team Leader, Crimes Against Persons 
Detective, and Patrol Sergeant, among others. 
With a commitment to fostering positive re-
lationships with residents and local service or-
ganizations, Chief Starnes has embodied key 
characteristics of successful community polic-
ing. He was also instrumental in developing 
the Department’s Crime Scene Investigations 
(CSI) Team, including formalizing training and 
upgrading CSI equipment. Chief Starnes’ 
breadth of experience across the Department 
has made him a reliable mentor and his col-
leagues hold him in high regard. He has built 
a reputation as an approachable leader who 
frequently walks the ranks to hear directly 
from staff and officers. 
Across his more than three decades of serv-
ice at the San Rafael Police Department, 
Chief Starnes has overcome challenges and 
overseen improvements to the benefit of the 
City’s people and places. He leaves behind a 
revered legacy with a long list of accomplish-
ments. Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that 
you join me in honoring Chief Starnes and ex-
tending our gratitude for his dedicated service 
to the San Rafael community and his fellow 
law enforcement officers.

and private-sector mandates by requiring fa-
cilities to comply with the OSHA standard. 
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly 
stem from Changes in Medicare payments to 
certain affected facilities to defray increased 
administrative and capital costs; Spending 
by OSHA to develop the standards, assuming 
appropriation of authorized amounts. 
Areas of significant uncertainty include

standard; Estimating the extent to which 
covered entities already comply with the 
OSHA guidelines; Estimating the reduction 
in workplace violence associated with the 
new requirements. 
BILL SUMMARY 
H.R. 1195 would require the Secretary of 
Labor to issue an interim final standard and 
a subsequent final standard that would re-
quire certain employers in the health care 
and social service sectors and employers con-
ducting related activities to develop and im-
plement plans to prevent and protect against 
workplace violence. At a minimum, employ-
ers would need to base their plans on a re-
port of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA), Guidelines for Pre-
venting Workplace Violence for Healthcare 
and Social Service Workers, and meet other 
requirements in the bill. 
ESTIMATED FEDERAL COST 
The estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 1195 
is shown in Table 1. The costs of the legisla-
tion fall within budget functions 550 (health) 
and 570 (Medicare).

BASIS OF ESTIMATE 
For this estimate, CBO assumes that the 
legislation will be enacted in fiscal year 2021 
and that the authorized and necessary 
amounts will be provided in each year. Out-
lays were estimated using information from 
OSHA and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
DIRECT SPENDING 
Because H.R. 1195 would require health 
care facilities to implement plans to safe-
guard against workplace violence, the cost of 
operating health care facilities would in-
crease. The costs would stem from activities 
such as annual training of personnel, devel-
opment and implementation of plans to pre-
vent violence in the workplace, and develop-
ment and maintenance of certain changes to 
infrastructure. Using data from OSHA, CBO 
estimated the cost of compliance for hos-
pitals that do not already meet the stand-
ards. The costs would be partially offset by 
savings from a decrease in payments for 
workers’ compensation claims that result 
from workplace violence. CBO estimated 
those savings using data from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics on the cost of workers’ com-
pensation claims and the share of those 
claims that are related to workplace vio-
lence in hospitals. 
Some of the affected facilities receive 
Medicare payments that are based on the 
cost of operations; therefore, enacting the 
bill would increase costs to Medicare for 
those payments. On net, CBO estimates, en-
acting H.R. 1195 would increase direct spend-
ing by $70 million over the 2021–2031 period, 
with the cost in early years of coming into 
compliance exceeding the cost in subsequent 
years of maintaining compliance with the 
standards. 
SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION 
Implementing H.R. 1195 would increase 
costs for the Department of Labor. Using in-
formation from OSHA, CBO estimates that 
the administration would need about 20 addi-
tional employees, at an average annual cost 
of $165,000 each, as well as additional con-
tractors to support the rulemaking process 
and to improve the information technology 
systems that would handle new record-keep-
ing. Such spending would be subject to the 
availability of appropriated funds. CBO ex-
pects that it would take OSHA about four 
years to complete the requirements. On that 
basis, CBO estimates that implementing the 
bill would cost $18 million over the 2021–2026 
period. 
UNCERTAINTY 
The estimated costs are subject to a fair 
amount of uncertainty. For example, CBO 
cannot predict precisely what the require-
ments in the final standard would entail. 
CBO also does not have exact information 
about which covered entities already comply 
with the proposed requirements or the ex-
tent to which those requirements would re-
duce workplace violence. The bill describes 
only the minimum requirements for the final 
standard. If that standard differs substan-
tially from the minimum, direct spending 
could be higher or lower. Also, the number of 
covered entities already in compliance could 
differ from CBO’s estimates. Finally, this es-
timate accounts for savings to covered enti-
ties from a decrease in workplace violence. If 
that decrease is larger or smaller than CBO 
estimates, spending would be lower or high-
er. 
PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes 
budget-reporting and enforcement proce-
dures for legislation affecting direct spend-
ing or revenues. The net changes in outlays 
that are subject to those pay-as-you-go pro-
cedures are shown in Table 2.

INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DEFICITS 
CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1195 
would not increase on-budget deficits by 
more than $5 billion in any of the four con-
secutive 10–year periods beginning in 2032. 
MANDATES 
H.R. 1195 would impose intergovernmental 
and private-sector mandates as defined in 
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) 
on health care facilities by requiring them to 
comply with the new OSHA rule. 
Because the bill would apply to health care 
facilities broadly, it would affect public fa-
cilities, including hospitals and skilled nurs-
ing centers operated by state and local gov-
ernments. CBO estimates that in the first 
two years in which the final rule is in effect, 
the annual net cost to public entities would 
be at least $100 million and would exceed the 
intergovernmental threshold established in 
UMRA ($85 million in 2021, adjusted annually 
for inflation) in those years. In later years, 
CBO estimates, public entities would spend 
$55 million annually to comply. 
CBO estimates that the annual net cost to 
private entities would be at least $1.8 billion 
in the first two years the final rule is in ef-
fect and $750 million annually thereafter. 
Those costs would exceed the private-sector 
threshold ($170 million in 2021, adjusted an-
nually for inflation) in each of the first five 
years in which the rule is in effect. 
H.R. 1195 would impose mandates on cov-
ered facilities by requiring them to: 
Provide annual staff training; 
Investigate violent incidents; 
Develop violence prevention plans that in-
clude risk assessment, hazard correction, 
and infrastructure upgrades; 
Maintain and retain related records for at 
least five years; and 
Report and evaluate information as re-
quired by the OSHA rule. 
The requirements for training, investiga-
tion, engineering, and infrastructure changes 
would impose substantial personnel and cap-
ital costs. 
Based on published research, however, CBO 
expects that compliance with the mandate 
also would lead to savings in workers’ com-
pensation expenses for covered entities. 
Those savings, amounting to several hundred 
million dollars, are reflected in the costs 
noted above. The mandate costs also reflect 
current efforts to mitigate the effects of vio-
lence. For example, some states already re-
quire actions similar to the proposed stand-
ard and some facilities now comply volun-
tarily. Furthermore, the Occupational Safe-
ty and Health Act has limited applicability 
to state and local government employees. 
CBO expects that covered facilities could see 
additional benefits, including reduced staff 
turnover and absenteeism, which would rep-
resent savings not directly attributable to 
the mandates in the bill. 
Using information provided by OSHA, CBO 
expects that the rule would affect about 
200,000 facilities, including hospitals, free-
standing emergency centers, and nursing 
homes and other residential facilities. CBO 
estimates that larger facilities, particularly 
hospitals and nursing homes, would incur 
significant but uncertain costs because of 
the possibility of more frequent reporting of 
incidents and the likelihood of expensive in-
frastructure changes. Although CBO assumes 
that entities would comply in the most cost- 
effective manner, the cost of the mandate 
could rise significantly if the number and na-
ture of violent incidents required additional 
staff training and infrastructure changes.

CONGRATULATING 
LOVING 
BOT-
TOMS DIAPER BANK FOR DIS-
TRIBUTING THEIR 1-MILLIONTH 
DIAPER 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Loving Bottoms Diaper Bank for 
distributing its 1-millionth diaper to help fami-
lies in need. 
Loving Bottoms was founded in 2015 by 
Lee Ann Porter, who recognized that social 
service organizations were struggling to pro-
vide diapers for those in need across the Cen-
tral Illinois community. In 2016, Loving Bot-
toms began to grow, adding counties to its 
service area. By 2018, Loving Bottoms ex-
panded again, and began to distribute men-
struation supplies to those struggling to ac-
cess these necessary items. By February of 
2019, 250,000 diapers had been distributed, 
and by March of 2021, one million diapers 
reached those most in need. I thank Loving 
Bottoms for the services it provides to families, 
individuals and the greater community. 
It is because of leaders such as Loving Bot-
toms Diaper Bank that I am especially proud 
to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally

INTRODUCTION OF THE PITTMAN- 
ROBERTSON WILDLIFE RESTORA-
TION ACT AND DINGELL-JOHN-
SON SPORT FISH RESTORATION 
ACT 
DISTRICT 
OF 
COLUMBIA 
EQUALITY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the Pittman-Robertson Wild-
life Restoration Act and Dingell-Johnson Sport 
Fish Restoration Act District of Columbia 
Equality Act, which would make the District of 
Columbia eligible for the same federal funding 
as states under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife 
Restoration Act and the Dingell-Johnson Sport 
Fish Restoration Act. The District is treated as 
a state under federal programs, with a few ex-
ceptions, most of them simply oversights or 
failures to update post-home rule. 
The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration 
Act provides funding, derived from excise 
taxes on sporting equipment, for five distinct 
purposes: program administration, wildlife res-
toration, basic hunter education and safety, 
enhanced hunger education and safety grants 
and multistate conservation grants. The Dis-
trict does not receive any funding under this 
Act. The Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restora-
tion Act provides funding for sport fish restora-
tion, aquatic education, wetlands restoration 
and boat-related activities. Under this Act, 
states receive a minimum of one percent of 
the total amount apportioned, while the District 
is capped at one-third of one percent. 
This omission and lack of parity under these 
Acts have serious consequences for the Dis-
trict. The District has roughly 7,800 acres of 
parkland covering nearly a quarter of the city, 
which means it has more parkland per capita 
than any other city in the United States. This 
bill would define ‘‘State’’ in these Acts to in-
clude the District, providing the District with 
equal funding for wildlife conservation in our 
nation’s capital. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill.

Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud students, 
Baylee Hughes and Dakota Hull, for earning 
the Best in Show Award for their creative and 
unique mobile application (app) as part of the 
2021 Congressional App Challenge. 
As first-time participants in the challenge, 
this team from the STEM Launch School built 
an app entitled ‘‘Chatroom’’ to create a safe 
portal for teens to talk with one and about a 
variety of issues. 
The students of STEM Launch School spent 
countless hours and used numerous tools to 
learn about coding, developed new skills, and 
further advanced their STEM education. Their 
perseverance and dedication to this challenge 
exemplifies the character and determination 
the faculty instills in the students at the school. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
these students for their hard work on this 
project. I am certain these students will exhibit 
the same dedication and character in their fu-
ture accomplishments, and I wish them the 
best of luck going forward.

Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of the twenty-two outstanding teach-
ers in South Florida who have been awarded 
the Teacher of the Year award for 2020 from 
the Rotary Club of Boca Raton Sunrise.

ty-two schools in the greater Boca Raton area. 
Each awardee is selected by the school’s prin-
cipal. These teachers have dedicated their 
time to inspiring, empowering, and bettering 
the next generation of youth in our community. 
Their passion in this effort is truly worthy of 
our recognition. 
These twenty-two exemplary teachers have 
made a profound impact on their students 
through their caring, commitment, and profes-
sionalism. They are a cohort defined by integ-
rity, excellence, and the highest marks in all 
they do. The City of Boca Raton is fortunate 
to have such outstanding faculty.

Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor and pleasure to extend my per-

Mayo Addison ‘‘Biff’’ Hadden, III. Biff was re-
cently inducted into the 2020 Georgia Military

spanned nearly 31 years and encompassed 
Infantry, Special Forces, and ROTC assign-
ments, including two tours in Vietnam with the 
elite Delta Force element. He was also se-
lected for a Joint Task Force with the XVIII 
Airborne Corps in Grenada during Operation 
Urgent Fury to become the headquarters J–3, 
Operations, Plans, and Training Officer. 
During two years in Vietnam with the 5th 
Special Forces Group, then Captain Hadden 
served as a Long Range Reconnaissance Pla-
toon Leader, Senior Advisor to a South Viet-
namese Airborne Ranger Battalion, and Oper-
ations Officer of Project Delta, a special mis-
sion unit. In May of 1967, while fighting in the 
A Shau Valley, he was seriously wounded. On 
August 20, 1969, when Delta’s forward base 
camp came under a massive attack, he brave-
ly moved through heavy fire to direct effective 
offensive action against the attackers. For his 
heroism in battle in Vietnam, he was awarded 
4 Bronze Stars (1 w/VDevice), 6 Air Medals (1 
w/V Device), a Purple Heart, a Navy Unit 
Commendation Medal, and a Combat Infantry-
man Badge among several other military 
decorations including the Legion of Merit. 
Colonel Hadden’s final military assignment 
was with the U.S. Army Infantry School and 
Fort Benning, where he retired as Inspector 
General in 1993 before becoming the Senior 
Vice President of Economic Development and 
Military Affairs for the Columbus Georgia 
Chamber of Commerce. During his time as 
Senior Vice President, he oversaw the nego-
tiations for the Columbus-Fort Benning Land 
Swap, the largest of its kind nationally. Addi-
tionally, in his ‘‘volunteer’’ role as acting Exec-
utive Director of the National Infantry Founda-
tion, he was instrumental in the development 
of plans for the new Museum and in fund-
raising of over $14 million for the iconic institu-
tion. 
Colonel Hadden has and continues to lend 
his selfless support to entities that support our 
nation’s military and his surrounding commu-
nity. Some of those include Fort Benning Re-
tiree Council, Congressional Service Academy 
Nomination Panels, Co-Chair Community En-
gagement Board, Military Officers Association 
of America (both chapter and state), and 
Georgia Special Forces, where he serves as 
Chapter President. 
Colonel Hadden has accomplished much in 
his life, but none of it would have been pos-
sible without the love and support of his wife, 
Trish; and his daughter, Terry. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me, my wife Vivian, and the more than 
730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second Con-
gressional District in extending our sincerest 
congratulations to the Colonel (Ret.) Mayo 
Addison ‘‘Biff’’ Hadden, III for his induction into 
the 2020 Georgia Military Veterans Hall of 
Fame and for his many years of service to his 
community, nation, and humankind.

Jack Sullivan is a student at Wayne Carle

The dedication demonstrated by Jack Sul-

develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Jack 
Sullivan for winning the Arvada Wheat Ridge

IN RECOGNITION OF BLUE 
FRIDAY’S 5 YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Mr. Jeff Katz and the 
fifth anniversary of his ‘‘Blue Friday’’ program. 
Blue Friday was founded in memory of fallen 
Richmond 
Police 
Officer 
Lieutenant 
Jan 
McTernan to honor her memory and legacy by 
recognizing local police officers. 
Once a month, Blue Friday pays tribute to a 
local Central Virginia Law Enforcement officer, 
highlighting their valiant and tireless efforts to 
protect their communities. 
Over these five years, the Blue Friday pro-
gram has displayed Virginia’s commitment to 
advocacy and civic engagement. Blue Friday 
lends a needed and welldeserved voice to law 
enforcement, going above and beyond to raise 
awareness and honor outstanding law en-
forcement officers in our community. Their dis-
plays of courage and determination set an ex-
cellent example for all of those around us. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me today to honor and celebrate the 
fifth anniversary of the Blue Friday program. I 
look forward to hearing about the future offi-
cers recognized and the stories of their heroic 
commitment to our community.

CHIEF 
ROD 
BLAKE (RETIRING AFTER OVER 
30 YEARS OF SERVICE) 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the distinguished career of 
Police Chief Rod Blake. As a graduate of 
Souderton High School, Chief Blake started 
his law enforcement career as an officer in 
West Rockhill Township. In 1992, West 
Rockhill merged with East Rockhill and 
Sellersville Borough to form the Pennridge Re-
gional Police Department. During his time with 
the Pennridge Regional PD, Chief Blake 
served in a variety of positions, spanning from 
Field Training Officer, Firearms Instructor, Ser-
geant, and eventually, the Chief of Police. At 
the time of this retirement, Chief Blake was 
the longest-tenured officer at the station. 
Chief Rod Blake has had a lasting impact 
on every employee at Pennridge Regional, 
where he has been involved in the hiring proc-
ess of everyone who comes through those 
doors. His mission was to serve and protect 
the community, and I cannot think of someone 
who embodied this ethos more than Chief 
Blake. As someone who said that they cannot 
see themselves working for another depart-
ment, we are extremely grateful that Chief 
Blake has served for over 30 years in our 
community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF TONY 
BUTKOVICH 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Tony Butkovich, who led a 
short, but very meaningful life. 
Tony was born on April 2, 1921 in St. David, 
Illinois. At Lewistown High School, he was a 
star athlete and excelled at both basketball 
and football. In 1939, Tony led Lewistown 
High School to an undefeated football season 
and the basketball team to the IHSA State 
Playoffs. After high school, he was recruited 
by several schools, but chose the University of 
Illinois. Tony then chose to do his officer’s 
training at Purdue University for the U.S. Ma-
rines. While there, he led their football team to 
an undefeated season for the first time in his-
tory. The U.S. Marines called him into active 
duty before he could finish out the year at Pur-
due. Tony even participated in the Mosquito 
Bowl in 1944, a touch-turned-tackle football 
game with All-American players during his 
time in the Marines. Sadly, he was killed in 
1945 at the Battle of Okinawa at the age of 
24. I commend him for a life well-lived, and I 
honor him today on what would have been his 
100th birthday.

HONORING DEBRA NESS AND HER 
OUTSTANDING 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
TO 
THE 
NATIONAL 
PARTNER-
SHIP FOR WOMEN 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Debra Ness for her 17 years of 
leadership at the National Partnership for 
Women & Families. 
Debra Ness is a more than a changemaker. 
In her nearly two decades of leadership at the 
National Partnership, she has been a powerful 
force, a unifying voice, and a trusted, strategic 
partner in the fight to help women and families 
live better lives. 
Debra and I worked hand in glove long be-
fore I became a Member of Congress. We 
worked closely together during my time as po-
litical director of EMILY’s List—in fact, we 
worked on the same floor in the same build-
ing. Even then, Debra was a champion and a 
visionary in the fight against gender discrimi-
nation. 
Debra embodies the search for and the 
commitment to social and economic justice. 
And in great part due to that commitment, 
today Members of Congress and political and 
community leaders across the country rely on 
the National Partnership for Women & Fami-
lies for our fights on health care, equal pay for 
equal work, reproductive health, and of 
course, paid family leave. 
Debra has always been there, on the front 
lines, strategically building coalitions when it 
counts. I know that we have reached a mo-
ment to create lasting change, the infrastruc-
ture for the future, because of the energy 
Debra has directed and the ground that she 
helped the National Partnership plow. 
I am sad to see Debra leave this position, 
but I know she will continue to be a steadfast 
partner and an unshakeable champion of 
women and families.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF JOHN DENNIS FORBES 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 12, 2021 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of John 
Dennis Forbes. John was a selflessly com-
mitted educator, mentor, and coach, and a 
true pillar of our community. The people of our 
island will fondly remember him as a devoted 
public servant whose life’s work has helped 
mold the minds of thousands of our youth over 
the decades. 
After graduating from high school in 1950, 
John enlisted in the United States Air Force. 
Three years later, he was assigned to Ander-
sen Air Force Base in Guam where he mar-
ried the late Rosalind Marie Limtiaco. When 
the Korean War came to an end, John was 
honorably discharged and used the benefits of 
the GI Bill to begin his undergraduate studies 
in 1954. He then transferred from Columbia 
College, the undergraduate college of Colum-
bia University, to San Francisco State Univer-
sity to complete his bachelor’s degree in His-
tory. Later in life, he returned to school to ob-
tain a master’s degree in History from the Uni-
versity of Guam in the 1980s. 
By 1959, he and his family returned home 
to Guam where he intended to teach in our 
public school system. However, his path led 
him to Father Duenas Memorial School (FD). 
When a small group of Capuchin Friars took 
over the administration of the school, John an-
swered an urgent need for lay teachers at FD. 
In addition to teaching the social sciences, 
John coached bowling and tennis teams, 
coached seniors in taking the SAT and 
ASVAB tests, computed class rankings, and 
was a college counselor who assisted seniors 
in preparing for life beyond high school. Al-
though he retired after teaching for 35 years, 
John never ended his association with the 
school. His commitment, loyalty, and sense of 
duty brought him back to volunteer at FD 
every day wherein he continued to support the 
mission of FD for a remarkable 57 of the 68 
years of the school’s existence. 
Through his tireless service to FD, the 
young men who walked through its halls, and 
our larger island community, he became the 
patriarch of the school. Many of his students 
went on to become leaders in Guam and else-
where in public service or their chosen profes-
sions, and John taught the sons of those very 
students as well. On March 19, 2016, the 
school established the John Forbes Education 
Fund in honor of his legacy and contributions 
that truly gave meaning to the credo of FD, 
Fortes in Fide. He was also recognized with 
the Archdiocese of Agana’s Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award in Catholic education on the 60th 
anniversary of his association with FD. 
John Forbes is an icon of devotion, brilliant 
mentor to many, and dedicated educator 
whose life’s work illustrates an extraordinary 
commitment to others above and before self. 
His wisdom and lessons extended far beyond 
books and classrooms, and deeply impacted 
the lives of those who had the privilege of 
knowing him. I am deeply saddened by his 
passing, and I join the people of Guam in re-
membering and celebrating his life and legacy 
of unconditional service he leaves behind. I 
extend my deepest condolences to his sur-
viving sons, Mark and Father Eric Forbes, 
daughters-in-law Cina and JoAnn, grand-
children Erin, Michael, and Sean, great-grand-
children Kane, Andrew and Katie Jo, and the 
rest of his family and friends. He will be deep-
ly missed, and his love and memories will for-
ever remain in the hearts of the people of 
Guam.
