PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Savior, lead us like a Shepherd. Lord, 
we experienced more mass shootings 
over the weekend leaving a carnage of 
dead and wounded. Forgive us when we 
do too little too late. Give us the pru-
dence to anticipate the evil and choose 
the right priorities to prevent it. 
Lord, provide our lawmakers with 
the ability to discern and do what is 
right, even when it is difficult. Give 
them the courage to speak the truth 
regardless of the consequences. Help 
them to be productive in all their en-
deavors as they strive to walk along 
the paths of justice. 
And Lord, bless Ukraine. 
We pray in our Savior’s Name. Amen.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Alex Wagner, of the District 
of Columbia, to be an Assistant Sec-
retary of the Air Force. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GUN CONTROL 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will 
speak more on this subject later this 
week, but I spent much of last week, 
both Marcelle and I did, in Vermont. It 
is a very peaceful State. 
We walk across the fields at our 
home, walk down the dirt road where 
we live, and then go to various places 
just meeting with people all over the 
State. A lot of it was in what is called 
Chittenden County. That is about a 
quarter of the State’s population. That 
is where I was a prosecutor, State’s at-
torney is what we called it. 
I made it a point during that time 
that if we had a violent crime, a gun 
crime, I would go to the scene, whether 
it was 3 o’clock in the morning or 3 
o’clock in the afternoon. Some of the 
most violent ones were, of course, at 3 
o’clock in the morning. I can still re-
member every single one of them like 
it was yesterday, but they were a tiny 
fraction of what we see every day. 
I hear people say we should pray for 
these children. I would say pray that 
the Congress has the guts to stand up 
and pass real gun control legislation. 
In Vermont, we limit the number of 
rounds you can have in a semiauto-
matic weapon during deer season. We 
ought to try to protect children as 
much as we do deer. 
Again, fortunately in our State, the 
number of murders and shootings I 
went to were nothing like we see 
today. But I have awakened in the mid-
dle of the night remembering the 
scenes. When you are at a murder scene 
and it is a child who has been murdered 
and it is 3 o’clock in the morning, the 
grieving family is there, there is no 
way you forget it. 
That is more than 50 years ago I was 
doing that. I can tell you exactly what 
each of those rooms looked like. I can 
tell you exactly who the person was I 
prosecuted for it. And I can tell you ex-
actly how many times I prayed, Why

did this have to happen and never let it 
happen again. 
As I said, I will speak further on this. 
I know in my State of Vermont, we do 
have a very large percentage of gun 
owners. Most of them tell me, ‘‘Do 
something.’’ 
As I said, of course, pray for the chil-
dren. Pray that the Congress does the 
right thing with real—with real—gun 
control. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Last week, we 
paused to honor the men and women 
who paid the ultimate sacrifice in serv-
ice to our Nation and in defense of our 
freedoms. 
For families all across America, the 
long holiday weekend also kicked off 
the excitement of summer traditions, 
but, unfortunately, a year-and-a-half 
into the failed policies of this all- 
Democratic government, even modest 
family 
celebrations 
came 
with 
pricetags that were literally sky high. 
Today, the average price of gas in 
America reached a new record high. 
There is now just one State in our 
whole country where average prices 
haven’t passed $4.30. From trips across 
town to visits with relatives, driving is 
becoming an even more painful propo-
sition for working families. 
In Boyd County, one Kentuckian said 
it now cost him about $73 to fill up the 
tank. 
I just hope those prices will go down. 
Another in Lexington said: 
I’m traveling up north to take care of my 
mother up in Michigan. It’s a long haul, and 
yeah, it’s hard when it is this expensive. 
And sky-high fuel prices aren’t just 
hurting drivers. April saw the biggest 
1-month spike in airfare on record with 
tickets up nearly 20 percent. The cost 
of backyard cookouts and all other 
home-cooked meals are continuing to 
rise. Prices on everything from ground 
beef to eggs have clocked the fastest 
annual increase since 1979. 
What about big household purchases? 
Many families wait for Memorial Day 
weekend sales to fill a need around the 
house. Well, tools and hardware are 11 
percent more expensive than they were 
a year ago. Major appliances cost 12 
percent more. And furniture is up al-
most 15 percent. 
These record-setting prices have got 
working families literally surrounded, 
and the American people know exactly 
where these hardships are coming 
from. They know this pain is a direct— 
a direct—result of the failed policies 
that Washington Democrats pursued 
even as everybody warned that their 
reckless spending would cause infla-
tion. 
A little more than a year ago, Demo-
crats dumped $2 trillion of liberal 
waste onto our economy. Their own ex-
perts—their own experts—told them 
not to do it. President Obama’s top 
economist warned then it was ‘‘defi-
nitely too big for the moment.’’ 
President Clinton’s Treasury Sec-
retary said it could ‘‘set off infla-
tionary pressures of a kind we have not 
seen in a generation.’’ And both of 
them said it at the time. 
It was reported a few days ago that 
even Secretary Yellen, the President’s 
own Treasury Secretary, knew the 
spending spree was reckless and wished 
it were smaller. 
But our colleague, the Democratic 
leader, brushed aside expert concerns, 
saying that ‘‘I do not think infla-
tionary dangers, at least in the near 
term, are very real.’’ 
Well, now his party is presiding over 
out-of-control inflation, the worst in 
four decades, a year-on-year inflation 
rate of—listen to this—8.3 percent. And 
even that terrible number may be an 
understatement. 
In the early 1980s, right after the last 
bout of inflation this bad, the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics changed how they 
measure inflation. Larry Summers has 
coauthored a new research paper that 
tries to create an apples-to-apples com-
parison between the inflation figures 
today versus 40 years ago. 
So here is what they found: 
The current inflation regime is closer 
to that of the late 1970s than it may at 
first appear. 
In other words, Democrats have 
brought inflation much closer to the 
bad old days of the late seventies than 
the official numbers even make it look. 
Of course, no matter which way 
economists measure it, the American 
people know historic inflation when 
they feel it. It is impossible to ignore, 
from the gas pump to the supermarket, 
to the big-box store. 
On Democrats’ watch, working fami-
lies’ hard-earned dollars are buying 
them less and less. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING JOHN EDWARD PORTER 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
name ‘‘John Edward Porter’’ may not 
be well known to many people now, but 
there was a time when he had a special 
impact on America. 
I was proud to call him a colleague 
and my friend. John Porter was a Con-
gressman from Illinois who served at 
the same time I was a Member of the 
House. He did some remarkable things 
in his life. In the famous 10th District, 
he was a real leader on many issues. He 
represented that district in Chicago’s 
northern suburbs from 1980 until the 
year 2001 and for most of the time we 
served together in the House. I admired 
him. We always had a good, positive 
working relationship although we were 
of different political faiths. He was a 
leader and a voice for principled, bipar-
tisan cooperation within our Illinois 
congressional delegation. 
John Porter passed away last Friday. 
He was raised in a family where public 
service was a way of life. He took it to 
heart. He served in the U.S. Army Re-
serve from 1958 to 1964 and as an attor-
ney with the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice during the Kennedy administra-
tion. 
He was elected to the House in 1980 
when his predecessor, Abner Mikva, re-
signed to become a Federal judge. The 
two men were different in political 
faith, but in many regards, they were 
the same. Ab Mikva, you see, was a leg-
endary liberal Democrat, the son of 
Jewish immigrants from Ukraine who 
relied on welfare to survive the Great 
Depression. John Porter was a fiscally 
conservative Republican whose father 
was a judge. But they shared many val-
ues. They believed that public service 
was a noble profession and that govern-
ment could make life better and that 
America must remain a beacon of hope 
for the world. 
John Porter supported efforts to pro-
tect the environment in the earliest 
days. He championed human rights ef-
forts across the globe and efforts to 
protect the environment at home. He 
was the founder of the Congressional 
Human Rights Caucus. He was a key 
supporter of the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act. 
John Porter was an independent 
thinker who defied the National Rifle 
Association to support a national ban 
on assault weapons in 1994. It took 
guts. John Porter did the right thing. 
His greatest and most visionary con-
tribution to America was in the field of 
biomedical research. He was chair of 
the 
powerful 
House 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and 
Human Services, and Education. He 
was a driving force in the House behind 
the successful effort to double the 
funding for the National Institutes of 
Health. 
For those who may not know, the Na-
tional Institutes of Health in Wash-
ington, DC, is the leading medical re-
search agency in the world—in the 
world—and John Porter, this Congress-
man from Illinois, teamed up with two 
Senators to take on what seemed like 
an impossible assignment. He joined 
with Tom Harkin, a Senator from 
Iowa, a Democrat, and Arlen Specter, a 
Senator from Pennsylvania, a Repub-
lican. They set out to do the politically 
impossible—to double the budget for 
the National Institutes of Health. 
The new funding came at a critical 
moment in history. It made possible 
discoveries that literally changed the

world, including the famous Human 
Genome Project, which Dr. Francis 
Collins headed up at that time. It was 
one of the greatest scientific break-
throughs of the 20th century, and it 
happened because John Porter and the 
Senators I mentioned decided to make 
certain that the NIH had the resources 
when they needed it. 
The mapping of the human genome 
continues to transform medicine on a 
daily basis and has provided lifesaving 
cures all around the world. It is the 
leadership of NIH Director Dr. Collins 
and the inspiring example of John Por-
ter that convinced me to try to team 
up with Senators on the other side of 
the aisle and do the same in my time in 
the Senate. I admired John’s success so 
much that I decided to try to make it 
my own. So I teamed up with ROY 
BLUNT, a Republican from Missouri, 
and also, of course, with PATTY MUR-
RAY, a Democrat from the State of 
Washington, and we started our effort 
to see if we could increase dramati-
cally 
the 
National 
Institutes 
of 
Health’s budget. We did. We increased 
it by over 40 percent in the period of 
time that we have taken on this as-
signment and more to follow. 
The NIH recognized Congressman 
John Porter’s invaluable contributions 
in 2014 by naming its new Neuroscience 
Research Center in his honor. 
Loretta and I send our condolences to 
his wife Amy, their children, step-
children, and grandchildren, to John’s 
friends and colleagues, and to all who 
were inspired by his example to make 
our world and our Nation a better, 
healthier, safer place. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Madam President, 23 years ago, after 
the 
massacre 
at 
Columbine 
High 
School left 12 students and a teacher 
dead, the gun lobby and its allies in-
sisted that ‘‘Now is not the time’’ to 
talk about gun laws. In shooting after 
shooting since, as America has been 
stunned and grieving and burying its 
children, the gun lobby has demanded 
that we not ‘‘politicize’’ the issue of 
gun violence. They say we should wait 
until passions have cooled before tak-
ing any action to reduce gun violence 
in America. 
Well, the grim reality is this: It is no 
longer possible to wait months or 
weeks or even days after a mass shoot-
ing for passions to cool. The shootings 
just keep happening. So far this year, 
we have seen 246 mass shootings in 157 
days—more than 1 mass shooting every 
day. Just this past weekend, a string of 
11 mass shootings left at least 15 people 
dead and more than 60 others wounded 
in 
Tennessee, 
Pennsylvania, 
South 
Carolina, Arizona, Texas, Georgia, New 
York, and Michigan. No other devel-
oped nation on Earth has even a frac-
tion of the mass shootings we have in 
the United States. 
President Lincoln once said famously 
that ‘‘we cannot escape history.’’ This 
Senate cannot escape its responsibility 
to do something. We cannot allow our-
selves to grow numb and resigned to 
this mass murder. 
Negotiations are underway on a bi-
partisan basis to help reduce gun vio-
lence in America. I want to thank Sen-
ators CHRIS
MURPHY of Connecticut, 
JOHN CORNYN of Texas, and the other 
Democrats and Republicans who are 
trying to find a way to reduce gun vio-
lence. But it takes 60 Senators for that 
to happen. I hope in good faith we can 
at least take a step forward from this 
awful situation. 
The House of Representatives already 
acted last year to close gaps in the gun 
background check system. This week, 
the House will vote on bills to support 
extreme-risk protection orders, or ‘‘red 
flag’’ laws, and other important meas-
ures. 
Tomorrow, 
the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee, which I chair, will hold a 
hearing on the mass shooting that took 
place in Buffalo on May 14, just a few 
weeks ago, and the domestic terrorism 
threat it exposes. One of our witnesses 
is Garnell Whitfield, Jr., whose mother 
Ruth was murdered at Tops grocery 
store in Buffalo. 
Gun violence is now the leading 
cause of death among America’s chil-
dren and teenagers. It replaced auto-
mobile accidents. 
Next week, the Senate Judiciary 
Committee will hold a hearing to hear 
from experts about the lasting trauma 
that gun violence leaves on children. 
Next month, the Judiciary Com-
mittee will hold a hearing on the grow-
ing danger of gun violence to police, 
who 
increasingly 
find 
themselves 
outgunned on the streets. 
There was a retired police officer in 
that grocery store in Buffalo. His name 
is Aaron Salter. He served the commu-
nity and the police force, and he was 
there to bring security to that grocery 
store. When the shooter came in with 
his military style weapon, this police-
man did his duty. He pulled his hand-
gun. He was outgunned by this killer 
and lost his life. 
Let’s consider a few basic truths. 
No. 1, this crisis is not simply about 
school safety. It wouldn’t be solved by 
turning every school into an armed for-
tress. It is much bigger than schools 
alone. 
Last Friday, I went to a grade school 
in Chicago. I won’t name the name, but 
I have a granddaughter who is in the 
fourth grade there. There are 100 kids 
in the fourth grade in this school, and 
they all came to the assembly hall, 
where I gave them a little talk and an-
swered their questions. I couldn’t help 
but think as I stood there talking 
about my job and what is the hardest 
part and what is the best part. And I 
looked at those wonderful kids and I 
thought to myself, they are exactly the 
same age as the kids who died in 
Uvalde, TX. I couldn’t imagine for a 
second the horror that the families 
must have felt when they heard the 
news that there was a shooter on the 
premises in their school. I can’t imag-
ine that this Nation is so cold and cal-
lous that it would ignore the reality of 
human suffering—not just the deaths 
of those children and the teachers but 
what it meant to those families and 
still means to them to this day. 
But it isn’t just schools. Some people 
say: Well, if we just make a fortress 
out of the school, we will only have one 
door, and we will have metal detectors. 
And if the custodians and cafeteria 
workers and all the teachers and prin-
cipals are all carrying guns, then we 
can keep our kids safe. 
Think about that for a moment. Is 
that the answer in the United States of 
America to gun violence, that we are 
going to outgun any madman who 
comes on the premises carrying an as-
sault-type weapon? Is that as good as it 
gets in the United States of America? I 
think we can do better. 
Let’s not kid ourselves. As heart-
breaking as it is to hear of any vio-
lence in a school, schools are not the 
only places where this happens—gro-
cery stores, Walmarts, Waffle Houses, 
bars and night clubs, hospitals, doc-
tors’ 
offices, 
churches, 
synagogues, 
Sikh gurdwaras, movie theaters, sub-
ways, street corners, baby showers, 
graduation parties, weddings, funerals, 
big cities and small towns, north, east, 
south, and west. Gun violence can be 
found in every corner of America. It 
can happen anywhere to anyone at any 
time. 
Point No. 2: As horrific as they are, 
mass shootings are only a small part of 
America’s gun violence crisis. In 2020, 
the most recent year for which the 
CDC has statistics, 45,222 Americans 
died by gun violence in 2020—45,222. 
That total number of gun deaths was 
14 percent higher than the year before, 
25 percent higher than 5 years before, 
and 43 percent higher than 10 years. 
Counting only homicides, the 2020 
deaths were 34 percent greater than 
just 1 year earlier, 49 percent over 5 
years earlier, and 75 percent greater 
than a decade earlier. How can we look 
at those numbers and do nothing? 
In 2020, 79 percent of murders in the 
United States were carried out with 
guns—79 percent. How about Canada? 
What percentage of their murders in 
2020 were the result of guns? Thirty- 
seven percent. In the United States, 79 
percent; Canada, 37 percent; Australia, 
13 percent; United Kingdom, 4 percent. 
But it is 79 percent in the United 
States of America. It is horrible, and it 
is getting worse. 
Point No. 3: The changes the Senate 
is likely to consider pose no threat to 
the lifestyle of any law-abiding gun 
owner. Our goal is to save lives 
through responsible gun ownership. 
There is a website, and I am not 
going to mention its name, but it is 
sometimes viewed as the most prolific 
place to buy a gun on the internet. If 
you buy a gun on that site from a li-
censed firearms dealer, you have to 
pass a background check. But there are 
also what they call private sales on 
this site, one person selling to another 
person. Private gun sales on this 
website and at gun shows and other 
places require no background check.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2774 
June 6, 2022 
The two parties meet, and the buyer 
hands over money and leaves with a 
gun. 
A recent investigation by the gun 
safety organization Everytown found 
that in 2018, there were 1.2 million ads 
on this website to sell guns without a 
background check. 
Last week, it listed an ad—listen to 
this—for a private sale in Buffalo, NY, 
of an AR–15—the same kind of weapon 
that that madman took into the gro-
cery store and the same kind of weapon 
that was used against the school-
children in Uvalde, TX. Through that 
website, you could buy an AR–15 last 
week—no background check required. 
How long do these background checks 
take? In most cases, they take less 
than 5 minutes, and no law-abiding cit-
izen needs to worry about passing this 
test. We should close the deadly ‘‘pri-
vate sale’’ loophole to help keep guns 
out of the hands of people who are le-
gally prohibited from owning firearms. 
I support ‘‘red flag’’ laws that allow 
law enforcement to temporarily re-
move firearms from a person who is de-
termined by the court to be at risk of 
hurting himself or others. There are 19 
States, including Illinois, that have 
these laws, and they are an important 
tool for preventing violence. Even 
Florida’s Republican-controlled legis-
lature enacted a State ‘‘red flag’’ law 
after 
the 
Parkland 
massacre. 
We 
should support similar efforts. 
I will close with a story from my 
State. 
Three years ago, a convicted felon 
was fired from a job at a small manu-
facturing plant near Chicago. He went 
back a few hours later with a handgun. 
He shot and killed five of his former 
coworkers and wounded five police offi-
cers before killing himself. I attended 
the memorial services of several of 
those victims. Those murders happened 
in a town called Aurora, IL. 
Seven years before that, a gunman in 
another Aurora—this time in Colo-
rado—opened fire in a movie theater, 
killing 12 people and wounding 70 
more—killing 12 and wounding 70 more. 
When the police chief of Aurora, CO, 
heard about the Illinois rampage, he 
said to a reporter: Months from now, as 
people talk about the mass shootings 
of the world, some will ask: Which Au-
rora mass shooting are you talking 
about? 
Think about that. In nearly any 
other nation on Earth, the name of a 
town in which a mass shooting has 
taken place would be remembered and 
mourned for years or even decades. In 
America, gun deaths and even mass 
murders now happen with such sick-
ening regularity that some people have 
a hard time keeping the tragedies 
apart or of even remembering them. 
I might say to the Presiding Officer 
at this point, I know of the terrible 
shooting in your State over the week-
end where one of your State judges was 
gunned down. It is happening every-
where. I am so sorry that it touched 
your State this last weekend. 
Over this past week, I met with peo-
ple across Illinois to discuss gun vio-
lence. I met with police officers, youth 
in Chicago who had been affected by 
gun violence, and doctors at Stroger 
Hospital and at Lurie Children’s Hos-
pital. I spoke to so many people, and 
this was always the first topic they 
mentioned: gun violence. 
They asked me a basic question: 
When is Congress going to do some-
thing about this? 
The American people are sick and 
tired of gun violence, and they are des-
perate for us to bring change. This Sen-
ate has it within our power now to 
make changes that respect our Con-
stitution and the rights of law-abiding 
citizens that will literally save lives. 
The question is whether we have the 
conscience and the courage to take 
these numbers of steps forward to-
gether. Lives depend on it. 
When 
I left my granddaughter’s 
grade school last Friday, I thought 
about it all-day long—those beautiful 
kids and the kids down in Texas and 
the kids at Sandy Hook and the kids at 
Columbine and the kids at Parkland. 
All of these kids are being butchered 
by gun violence. 
Many people think, because the Con-
stitution and its Second Amendment 
gives us the right to bear arms, that we 
can’t touch this issue. They are wrong. 
The Supreme Court, in the Heller deci-
sion Justice Scalia wrote, made clear 
that we still retain the power to regu-
late the guns that are sold and how 
they are going to be used. We have got 
to take that and seize that oppor-
tunity. We have been elected to the 
U.S. Senate to respond to American 
crises. This is at the top of the list. 
After what we have been through in the 
last several weeks and what we are 
likely to go through in the weeks to 
come, how dare we say this is too big 
and too tough. How could anything be 
more important than the safety of our 
children and of our families across 
America? 
I will join in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, in any way that I can, to 
support this bipartisan effort. I hope 
that it is meaningful. I hope, when it is 
all said and done, we can point to it 
and say: We achieved something in the 
names of those families of survivors 
and of those who lost their lives—who 
have given so much to this madness 
that has become part of life in Amer-
ica. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The senior Senator from 
Iowa. 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
Congress has a constitutional responsi-
bility to ensure that the executive 
branch executes the laws and uses tax-
payer money that has been appro-
priated to do it according to congres-
sional intent. Now, around here, we 
refer to seeing that the laws are faith-
fully executed as the constitutional re-
sponsibility of oversight of the Con-
gress of the United States. In further-
ance of that constitutional responsi-
bility, Congress has an obligation to 
investigate the executive branch for 
fraud, waste, abuse, and gross mis-
management. I take my constitutional 
responsibilities of oversight very seri-
ously. 
From time to time, I receive infor-
mation that requires me to ask ques-
tions of the executive branch in efforts 
to better understand whether any 
wrongdoing has occurred and, if so, 
what remedial actions will be taken 
and employed to cure the damage done. 
That is what brings me to the floor of 
the Senate today, focusing on Assist-
ant Special Agent in Charge Timothy 
Thibault at the FBI’s Washington Field 
Office. 
Last week, while I was meeting with 
my constituents in Iowa, I sent a letter 
to the Justice Department and the FBI 
and also a letter to the Department of 
Justice’s inspector general. In those 
letters, I provided evidence of extreme 
leftwing bias shown by Special Agent 
Thibault. Now, in his position, he is a 
very powerful agent within the FBI—so 
powerful that he can open and close 
Federal public corruption cases and in-
vestigations. He is a shining example, 
at the same time, of what is wrong 
with the FBI. 
Andrew McCarthy wrote about Mr. 
Thibault last week and wondered what 
the heck has happened with the FBI. 
This FBI agent’s leftwing political bias 
was exposed by his very own LinkedIn 
and Twitter accounts. There, in those 
accounts, he posted highly partisan 
material related to his superiors, mat-
ters under the FBI’s purview, and mat-
ters 
under 
his 
own 
purview. 
His 
LinkedIn network includes current and 
former FBI personnel. The general pub-
lic is able to review his social media 
content, which includes his political 
views, his political biases, and objec-
tions. 
Thibault, under the title of Assistant 
Special Agent in Charge, directly post-
ed a partisan article related to the 
LTG 
Michael 
Flynn 
case 
to 
his 
LinkedIn account. The article was a 
September 3, 2020, opinion piece from 
the Washington Post, entitled ‘‘Why 
the Michael Flynn case still matters,’’ 
which was about the ‘‘Trump adminis-
tration’s abuses of the justice system.’’ 
He 
also 
‘‘liked’’ 
other 
politically 
charged articles relating to then-Presi-
dent Trump and his superior, then-At-
torney General Barr. 
Thibault’s public political associa-
tion doesn’t even end with those exam-
ples. 
According to his Twitter feed, which 
is also under his name, he mocked the 
election of one of our new colleagues, 
Senator TUBERVILLE, and the State of 
Mississippi at the same time. 
He said: 
Thank God for Mississippi—state motto of 
Alabama. 
I am not sure exactly what that 
means, but it is pretty clear that he is 
making fun.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2775 
June 6, 2022 
When 
Representative 
LIZ
CHENEY 
tweeted ‘‘Dick Cheney says wear a 
mask,’’ Thibault replied with this: 
Your dad was a disgrace. 
He recently tweeted: 
Can we give Kentucky to the Russian Fed-
eration? 
In response to a Catholic priest’s 
tweet that was critical of abortion, he 
tweeted an anti-Catholic slur to both 
Catholic priests and then-President 
Trump: 
Focus on the pedophiles. 
There are other examples, but I think 
it is pretty clear you get the bias of 
this particular special agent. You get 
the picture, in other words. 
After my letters were made public, 
he reportedly then set his tweets to 
protected 
mode 
and 
deleted 
his 
LinkedIn profile. His social media ac-
tivity likely violated several Federal 
regulations and Department guidelines. 
The guidelines are designed to prevent 
political bias from infecting FBI mat-
ters. Such restrictions on political ac-
tivity are heightened by senior FBI of-
ficials like Thibault because of the risk 
of improper influence on investigative 
matters. 
If he projects this type of political 
sentiment in public, using his name 
and title, there is absolutely no telling 
what he is doing within the privacy of 
his office and in front of subordinates. 
The fact that this FBI agent has the 
power to open and close investigations, 
particularly into political figures—Re-
publican and/or Democrat—is cause for 
serious concern. His actions present a 
grave risk of political infection and 
bias in his official decision-making 
process. 
Let me ask: What have the Justice 
Department and FBI done to oversee 
his work behavior? 
Let me ask: How many investiga-
tions have been infected by this polit-
ical bias by this special agent? 
I fear, for many years, he has been 
able to do whatever he has wanted to 
do. Accordingly, such conduct unques-
tionably undermines both the Justice 
Department and the FBI because, at a 
minimum, it creates the perception of 
the unequal application of the law. At 
the maximum, his political bias has 
materially affected investigative mat-
ters that he has been a part of. 
This is why the American people 
have lost confidence in the Justice De-
partment and the FBI to do the jobs 
that those two Agencies are assigned 
to do under our law. Political consider-
ations have infected these Agencies, 
and the cost is a loss of faith in the 
very institutions that depend on the 
American people’s trust for the credi-
bility of these Agencies. 
My press release last week listed a 
phone number and an email address for 
the Justice Department and FBI whis-
tleblowers to contact my office if they 
know some of these similar things that 
we need to know. Since then, I have 
had whistleblowers reach out to me 
about Thibault and others. I will have 
more to say on that matter, in the 
coming weeks, to my colleagues here 
in the Senate. 
I urge anyone who is willing to speak 
to government waste, fraud, abuse, and 
gross mismanagement to contact me. 
And, of course, I strongly urge the Jus-
tice Department and the FBI to clean 
house without hesitation. 
Transparency brings accountability, 
and my future investigative actions in 
this space will do exactly that. I am 
asking my colleagues to stay tuned. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
50-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE IX 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, just imagine: It is a Tuesday 
night in October. The shuffle of shoes 
screech across the waxed court, the 
buzzer sounds, and the crowd erupts in 
cheers as the home team scores the 
winning point. Clinching the first-place 
title, the home team gathers at center 
court, each player grinning from ear to 
ear. The excitement is tangible. It was 
a hard-fought season and a well-earned 
first-place title. The trophy is pre-
sented, pictures are taken, and team 
members high-five each other as fans 
charge the court to congratulate the 
winning team. 
What I just described are the final 
seconds of a high school girls’ basket-
ball game. Those who have witnessed a 
buzzer-beater win know there is noth-
ing like it. For the players, the fans, 
the parents, and all involved, it is a 
prized moment and a memory that will 
never be forgotten. But it is not just a 
memory; it is a valuable learning expe-
rience. 
Over the span of a year, teammates 
dedicate hundreds of hours of late- 
night and early morning practices. 
They overcome conflicts. They work 
together. They practice self-discipline. 
They perfect their craft. And they 
knew, if they gave it all, they would 
have a chance to be victorious with all 
this hard work and effort. 
I saw these learning experiences un-
fold time and time again throughout 
my 40-year career as a coach, educator, 
and mentor. A great deal has changed 
in the world of women’s athletics since 
I began my career coaching high school 
girls’ basketball almost 40 years ago. 
What an experience. 
Almost 50 years ago, female athletics 
received less than 2 percent of college 
athletic budgets, and athletic scholar-
ships for women were virtually non-
existent. Only 1 in 27 girls participated 
in intercollegiate sports in the United 
States 50 years ago—1 in 27. 
Since the 1970s, female participation 
in sports at the collegiate level has 
risen by more than 600 percent, and 
today 43 percent of the high school 
girls whom we have in school today 
participate in sports, up from 5 percent 
50 years ago. 
These strides in women’s athletics 
did not just happen by circumstance. 
They are the result of title IX protec-
tions passed by Congress in 1972 in this 
very room where we are today. Title IX 
provided females a long-denied plat-
form that had always been afforded to 
males only. It ensured female athletes 
had the same access to funding, facili-
ties, and athletic scholarships. That 
was title IX. 
It is an unquestionable truth that bi-
ological males have a physiological ad-
vantage over females. Title IX ac-
knowledged that truth for the benefit 
of women’s athletics. To break it down 
even more, one study states: On aver-
age, males have 40 to 50 percent greater 
upper limb strength, 20 to 40 percent 
greater lower limb strength, and an av-
erage of 12 pounds more skeletal mus-
cle mass than age-matched females at 
any given body weight. 
Title IX sent an incredible—incred-
ible—message to female athletes across 
the Nation. That message was: You can 
compete; you can win; and you will be 
afforded a fair and level playing field 
to do so. Because of these reasons, dec-
ades later, we know title IX has been a 
monumental success for female ath-
letes across this country. 
As the 50th anniversary of title IX 
approaches at the end of this month, 
we should be celebrating female ath-
letes who were given the opportunity 
to win first place, to learn the life les-
sons sports teaches each individual, 
and to overcome obstacles and reach 
their God-given potential. We should be 
asking ourselves how we can preserve 
title IX so female athletes 50 years 
from now can experience the same 
euphoric feeling of hard work and hard- 
earned victory. 
But, unfortunately, with the Biden 
administration’s proposal, in the next 
few weeks, we will lose title IX protec-
tions for female athletes as we know it. 
Later this month, it is expected that 
President Biden’s Department of Edu-
cation will publish a proposed rule to 
change title IX to align more with the 
administration’s progressive agenda. 
These proposed changes would re-
quire schools to allow biological males 
to compete in women’s sports. It would 
take a wrecking ball to five decades of 
title IX success and tilt what was a 
level playing field to the far left. With 
the Biden administration’s proposal, 
female athletes will lose. We cannot 
allow title IX’s protections for female 
athletes to be eroded. It has been too 
much of a success. 
I plan to continue leading efforts 
against this misguided policy to ensure 
no Federal action will negatively im-
pact female athletes. Recently, I have 
spoken with numerous female athletes

who were able to compete and win be-
cause of title IX. Additionally, I intro-
duced an amendment to prohibit Fed-
eral funding to schools that allow bio-
logical males to compete in women’s 
sports. 
I have also repeatedly called for the 
Senate to pass the Protection of 
Women and Girls in Sports Act, legisla-
tion I helped introduce that would en-
sure the definition of ‘‘sex’’ in title IX 
is based on ‘‘solely a person’s reproduc-
tive biology and genetics at birth’’ and 
prohibit Federal funding to institu-
tions that do not uphold that defini-
tion. 
Just last week, I sent a letter to U.S. 
Department of Education Secretary 
Cardona, warning the administration 
to rethink this rule change. The Biden 
administration’s title IX rule flies in 
the face of the so-called science that 
Democrats are quick to pledge their al-
legiance to by ignoring the scientific 
differences in biological makeup of 
male and female athletes. Apparently, 
science only holds water when it con-
forms to the Democrats’ partisan agen-
da. 
Allowing biological males to compete 
in women’s sports will set women’s 
rights back 50 years to a time before 
title IX. It will discourage young girls 
from entering the court, jumping in 
the pool, walking on the field because 
they will know they will have to com-
pete with the deck stacked against 
them; they can only hope to win second 
place, at best. 
So the bottom line is that there is 
really no pregame speech or halftime 
talk you can give to a woman or a girl 
who feels like they aren’t competing on 
a fair playing field, like 50 years ago. 
With this proposed rule, girls will be 
playing for second. 
The Biden administration should do 
the right thing and rethink their deci-
sion that would destroy female ath-
letics as we know it today. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, like 
so many people in Texas and across the 
country, I can’t stop thinking about 
the 19 children and the two teachers 
who lost their lives in Uvalde, TX. Over 
the last several days, 21 families have 
started burying their loved ones. This 
tight-knit community of 15,000 people 
60 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border is 
grieving the loss of classmates, play-
mates, friends, neighbors, colleagues, 
and fellow church members. 
As grief turns to anger and anger 
turns to action, everyone is asking the 
question—the logical question—how do 
we stop these sort of things from hap-
pening again? Well, I think that is the 
right question. That is the question 
that has been on my mind and domi-
nating conversations with my col-
leagues the last couple of weeks. 
This is a big diverse country. There 
are a lot of differences regionally, cul-
turally, and the like. Each of us have 
ideas about what would work best, but 
that is the genius of our Federal sys-
tem, one that Louis Brandeis called the 
‘‘laboratories of democracy’’ because 
‘‘one size fits all’’ is not necessarily al-
ways the right solution. 
But those of us who work here in the 
Senate know this is not just about our 
goals or ideals; it is about what was 
once called the ‘‘art of the possible.’’ 
Perfect bills exist only in our imagina-
tion and we have to be realistic about 
what can pass both Chambers of Con-
gress and get the President’s signature. 
And we know it is not easy by design. 
The Founding Fathers had this idea 
that if they made it hard to pass legis-
lation, if they forced us to build con-
sensus, that we wouldn’t pass a lot of 
laws that would limit individual free-
dom and liberty; that it would only be 
where there was a true national con-
sensus that we could get those laws 
passed. 
Over the last week and a half, I have 
been talking, particularly with Senator 
MURPHY, 
Senator 
TILLIS, 
Senator 
SINEMA, but, literally, with everybody I 
could reach on the phone or get 
through text message to see if there is 
some package of mental health and 
safety legislation that addresses some 
of the factors that might have pre-
vented the recent shootings in Uvalde 
and elsewhere. 
I want to be clear, though. We are 
not talking about restricting the rights 
of current law-abiding gun owners or 
citizens. This is a constitutional right, 
as much as that may go against the 
grain of some of our colleagues who 
would like to see us do things that 
would restrict the right of American 
citizens under the Second Amendment. 
The right to keep and bear arms is 
guaranteed by the Constitution itself. 
And the vast majority of the Repub-
lican conference feels, certainly, the 
same way. 
What I am interested in is keeping 
guns out of the hands of those who, by 
current law, are not supposed to have 
them—people with mental health prob-
lems, 
people 
who 
have 
criminal 
records. 
Again, this is about the ‘‘art of the 
possible.’’ In order to deliver results, 
we have to build consensus, and the 
best way to do that is through targeted 
reforms. We have actually had success 
doing this before. On November 5, 2017, 
a 
tight-knit 
community 
in 
Texas 
called Sutherland Springs was the tar-
get of a shooting. A gunman opened 
fire at a small Baptist church, killing 
26 people. We quickly learned that the 
shooter had a long and disturbing 
record of violence—school suspensions, 
comments about wanting to kill his su-
periors in the military, animal abuse, 
violence against those closest to him, 
felony, domestic violence convictions— 
he fractured the skull of his stepson in 
a fit of anger, and he even spent time 
in military prison. Yet, under the ex-
isting National Instant Criminal Back-
ground Check System, the Air Force 
had not uploaded that information. 
Under 
existing 
Federal 
law, 
the 
shooter was prohibited from ever pur-
chasing or possessing a firearm. So how 
did he get his hands on a semiauto-
matic weapon that he used to take 26 
innocent lives? Well, it was because of 
a broken system. He was able to pur-
chase four firearms because the infor-
mation about his criminal history had 
never been uploaded into the National 
Instant Criminal Background Check 
System known as the NICS system. In 
that case, it was clear that the answer 
was, How do we stop this again? It was 
obvious: Get the background check sys-
tem improved to record existing dis-
qualifications to purchase or possess 
firearms. 
Senator MURPHY and I introduced the 
Fix NICS Act to ensure all depart-
ments and agencies accurately and cor-
rectly 
uploaded 
these 
conviction 
records on a timely basis. That bill, at 
the time it became law, had more than 
70 bipartisan cosponsors, and it was 
signed into law in March 2018. And here 
is what happened next. In the first 3 
years since that bill became law, 111⁄2 
million additional records have been 
uploaded into the three national data-
bases—11.5 million additional records. 
The number of records in one of those 
databases increased by more than 30 
percent. 
I believe the reason we were able to 
succeed with the Fix NICS legislation 
is because it addressed a glaring prob-
lem without jeopardizing the rights of 
law-abiding citizens under the Second 
Amendment. I mentioned that the bill 
had more than 70 cosponsors. I am re-
minded here that it had 77 bipartisan 
cosponsors. And that was how we 
passed the first major reform to the 
background checks system in 25 years. 
My hope is we can take the same ap-
proach here to build consensus by tar-
geting the problem with a targeted so-
lution. 
This one is actually harder because 
in Uvalde there were so many points of 
failure—not just one—multiple points 
of failure. But one obvious glaring 
issue is the lack of mental health 
intervention. According to the reports 
we have seen, the shooter was isolated, 
he was bullied, he harmed himself, he 
self-mutilated. He had a history of 
fighting and threatening students and 
abusing animals. These are textbook 
signs, compounded with a profile we 
have seen too often of someone who 
could pose, not only as a threat to him-
self, but to others, as well. 
But these signs were ignored, and we 
saw the tragic consequences. I don’t 
think it is breaking news to say that 
there is a mental health crisis among 
America’s children, and we can’t ignore 
the devastating impact that the pan-
demic had on a lot of our young people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2777 
June 6, 2022 
In a recent survey conducted by the 
New York Times, 94 percent of school 
counselors said their students were 
showing more signs of anxiety and de-
pression than before the pandemic. And 
88 percent said students were having 
more trouble regulating their emotions 
and almost three-quarters said they 
were having difficulty solving conflicts 
with their friends. One counselor said: 
‘‘Kids are more impulsive, [they are] 
less controlled, and struggle with emo-
tional regulation.’’ 
I believe we need to take this oppor-
tunity to support our children who 
struggle with emotional or mental 
health problems, and that is something 
I believe will bring us together and all 
100 Senators can agree on. 
Another big issue is school safety. 
This shooter should never have been 
able to gain access to Robb Elementary 
School 
that 
day. 
Again, 
the 
cir-
cumstances of how he gained that ac-
cess are still under investigation. Ini-
tial reports indicated the door had been 
propped open. Now the police say the 
door had been closed but did not auto-
matically lock like it was supposed to. 
If our schools need more resources to 
harden their infrastructure and evalu-
ate their physical security measures 
and make necessary improvements, 
that is something we can agree on and 
something we need to do. No one 
should be able to walk through the 
door of a school and access a classroom 
so easily. You can’t get into an airport 
very easily. We know how to do this. 
Improving school safety also means 
reviewing current protocol, developing 
best practices, and adding or maybe ex-
panding the number of school resource 
officers. 
These are commonsense ways to save 
lives, and we need to provide schools 
with the resources to protect our stu-
dents and our teachers. 
I am a proud supporter of the Second 
Amendment, period. We also recognize, 
though, that there are people who are 
prohibited by current law from pur-
chasing guns, like the shooter in Suth-
erland Springs, because of criminal 
records or mental illness. 
We are discussing possible additional 
reforms to keep guns out of the hands 
of people who are not legally allowed 
to purchase or possess them in the first 
place. If we reach an agreement, law- 
abiding gun owners will not be im-
pacted at all. Our conversations are on-
going, and, indeed, all 100 Senators will 
be part of that conversation, but these 
are the broad parameters of the things 
that I am interested in addressing. We 
are not talking about banning a cat-
egory of weapons across the board, a 
ban on certain high-capacity maga-
zines, or changing the background 
check system by adding additional dis-
qualifying items. If we are actually se-
rious about finding common ground 
and building consensus, those sorts of 
things will stand no chance of passing 
the Senate. Instead, we are talking 
about commonsense, targeted reforms 
that are responsive to the tragedies in 
Uvalde and elsewhere and that will, I 
believe, help save lives—strengthening 
mental health, bolstering school secu-
rity, keeping guns out of the hands of 
people who are already legally prohib-
ited from having them. I think a lot of 
our colleagues could get behind those 
provisions like they did with the Fix 
NICS bill. 
Following Sutherland Springs, we 
came up with a targeted bill to address 
specific circumstances. I hope we can 
do so again. I will not settle on inad-
equate or downright harmful legisla-
tion for the sake of doing something. 
That is not productive for anyone. 
That is one of the things I hear the 
most. People say ‘‘Do something.’’ 
Well, we can agree that something 
needs to be done, but what that some-
thing is, is much harder to achieve, and 
so targeted reforms, I think, are the 
way to get to where we need to go. 
I understand the desire for quick ac-
tion, but I hope the Democratic leader 
will allow bipartisan discussions to 
continue and then conclude before he 
pulls the plug and schedules show votes 
on something he knows can’t pass. He 
has threatened to do it, but I don’t be-
lieve we ought to try to meet artificial 
deadlines. We know how to do this, and 
I think giving the Senate adequate 
time over the next week or so to try to 
reach that consensus is eminently rea-
sonable. 
I don’t believe the Senate will be vot-
ing this week because good consensus 
legislation takes time. So I hope Sen-
ator SCHUMER
will let his Members 
work. There is no use in rushing a vote 
on a doomed, partisan bill like the 
House is expected to vote on this week. 
My goal is to achieve a result, and the 
only way we can do that, the only way 
we can get a bill that will pass both 
Chambers and earn the President’s sig-
nature, is by taking the time and 
reaching that consensus. 
Right now, there is not a bill out 
there that stands a chance of suc-
ceeding in the coming days, but my 
hope is that will change by allowing 
the Senate to do the work we know 
how to do and come up with a bipar-
tisan bill that commands the support 
of 60-plus Members of the Senate and 
something we can send to the Presi-
dent for his signature. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SERGEANT FIRST CLASS HEATH ROBINSON ACT 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, it is 
an honor to be here on the Senate floor 
tonight to talk about a topic, and it is 
an honor to have you in the Chair as I 
do so. 
I rise late this afternoon to discuss a 
piece of legislation that will be before 
the Senate perhaps for a good portion 
of this week and maybe even into the 
next. It is the most comprehensive 
toxic exposure package the Senate has 
ever considered in our Nation’s history. 
Since September 11, 2001, up to 3.5 
million deployed servicemembers have 
potentially encountered toxic expo-
sures from burn pits. During a deploy-
ment to a war zone, military personnel 
are often exposed to toxic hazards, 
many of which have been associated 
with chronic health issues. 
Not really as an aside but unrelated 
to this piece of legislation, a cause I 
now undertake and have been pursuing 
since this topic arose is to make sure 
that in the future, there are no burn 
pits that our service men and women 
encounter in their service to our Na-
tion. While we are preparing to take 
care of those who have experienced 
burn pits in the past, let there be no 
more burn pit experiences. 
Until almost 2010, the U.S. military 
kept burn pits on bases for the disposal 
of chemicals, plastics, medical waste, 
and other substances that were just 
burned with jet fuel, creating toxic 
substances, toxic smoke. 
Currently, the VA can provide serv-
ice-connected disability claims related 
to burn pit exposures; however, due to 
lack of evidence, scientific data, and 
information from the Department of 
Defense, at least 70 percent of the 
claims are denied. 
Over the past 2 years, nearly every 
veterans service organization has testi-
fied before the Senate Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs and emphasized the 
importance of fixing the process the 
VA uses to provide healthcare and ben-
efits to toxic-exposed veterans. JON 
TESTER, the Senator from Montana, 
the chairman of the Senate Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee, and I have worked 
in a bipartisan fashion with these vet-
erans organizations, with veterans, 
with advocates, with the VA, and with 
our Senate colleagues on and off of the 
committee to craft a comprehensive 
bill to deliver all generations of toxic- 
exposed 
veterans 
long-overdue 
healthcare and benefits. 
Three weeks ago, Senator TESTER 
and I announced the Sergeant First 
Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our 
Promise to Address Comprehensive 
Toxics Act of 2022. It has many prior-
ities, but among those, this historic 
legislation 
will, 
one, 
expand 
VA 
healthcare eligibility; two, improve the 
VA’s presumption process; three, bol-
ster the VA’s toxic exposure training 
and resources; four, strengthen toxic 
exposure research; and five, set up VA 
and veterans for success. 
Last week over Memorial Day, our 
country paused to remember and honor 
those who served our Nation. My ex-
pectation—my guess is that almost 
every Member of the U.S. Senate in 
some fashion over the weekend spent 
time with veterans, paying respect, 
giving them honor. 
One Kansas veteran, when I was in 
Wichita, told me that he and his dad

both served in the U.S. Navy and that 
both had an experience with exposure 
to hazardous and toxic materials. He 
said he didn’t believe that either one of 
them suffered any major health issues 
from their exposure. It caused me to 
think that this is a veteran who is not 
necessarily going to care about this 
legislation, but what he said was that 
it was a concern that there would not 
be any help from the VA if they did, 
and they lived in fear and uncertainty. 
The veteran who didn’t think he or 
she had any negative consequences 
from exposure to toxic substances still 
worried about ‘‘What would happen if I 
did? What would happen if my health 
deteriorates’’ and worried that the VA 
would not be there for them or their 
families. 
After hearing the news of our com-
prehensive toxic exposure bill, this vet-
eran said: 
You have now changed that for thousands 
of veterans and their families. 
The uncertainty, the fear is dimin-
ished and maybe gone. 
It is time to advance this legislation 
and bring us one step closer to con-
necting all generations of toxic-ex-
posed veterans with the care they need 
and deserve and to provide veterans 
with certainty and support. 
I honor, I thank, I have great grati-
tude for every generation of veterans, 
and in my family’s lifetime, those who 
served in Iraq and Afghanistan are 
among the most significant to us. But 
Vietnam is a part of my life as a 16- 
year-old boy, a junior in high school. In 
fact, if you were a senior in my high 
school—my high school of 71 kids in 
my class, so I know them all—if you 
were just a year older than me, you 
served in Vietnam. And I saw how they 
were treated when they returned from 
their service, and they were treated 
terribly by fellow American citizens. 
As a 16-year-old kid, I told myself, I 
am going to do everything I can to 
honor and respect those who serve, see 
if I can compensate for the cir-
cumstances 
these 
people—many 
of 
whom I knew personally—can I com-
pensate for what they are experiencing 
today in the early 1970s and the 
midseventies? 
I never expected to be a Member of 
the U.S. Senate. Nothing in my life 
would suggest that that would be the 
case—the grace of God, the kindness of 
Kansans. But upon my arrival in Con-
gress, in the House and now the Senate, 
it became important for me to do 
something more than just honor and 
respect veterans, to do something more 
than saying ‘‘thank you,’’ to do the 
things that I can do as a Member of a 
legislative body to make certain that 
the Department of Veterans Affairs 
does its job but most importantly, that 
I as a Member of Congress do mine. 
It is important for us to pay respect, 
but it is also perhaps even more impor-
tant for us to make certain those who 
serve our Nation receive the care and 
benefits that they are entitled to and 
that they deserve. It is beyond just 
saying ‘‘thank you’’; it is saying 
‘‘thank you’’ by action. 
It is time to advance this legislation 
and bring us one step closer to con-
necting all generations to the cir-
cumstances that war brought to them 
and their families. And I hope that 
after Memorial Day, we brought back 
with us as we return this Monday—Me-
morial Day being a week ago today— 
that we brought back with us a sense of 
what their sacrifice means and commit 
to living our lives and doing our jobs 
worthy of their sacrifice. 
Decade after decade, service men and 
women have deployed to countries 
around the globe in defense of freedom, 
and we have seen just within the last 
year that there is no moment in which 
everyone is safe. There is no moment 
in which we may not have to ask peo-
ple to continue to serve, to serve 
longer, or to begin their service in de-
fense of freedom in the United States 
and freedom around the world. 
Unfortunately, throughout history, 
many of them were exposed to harmful 
toxins during that service that resulted 
in life-altering health conditions. 
Too many veterans—far too many 
veterans—face too many battles when 
they return home and are seeking the 
care and benefits they desperately 
need. Our veterans deserve better, and 
they are tired of waiting for solutions. 
This week, this body—the U.S. Sen-
ate—will discuss the Sergeant First 
Class Heath Robinson Act at great 
length, and I look forward to speaking 
more about this historic legislation on 
the Senate floor and with my col-
leagues so that we can deliver to all 
generations of toxic-exposed veterans 
the relief, the assistance, and maybe, 
yes, just the lack of fear, the lack of 
uncertainty that they deserve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to concur in the remarks 
just expressed by my colleague, and we 
do honor our veterans. And Senator 
MORAN serves as our ranking member 
at the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 
and we appreciate his leadership, as we 
all seek to honor that service and to 
fulfill the obligation that this great 
Nation has made to our veterans who 
don’t shrink from service, who don’t 
pass the blame. They get up every day 
and they execute on their mission, and 
I think it is important for each and 
every one of us to remember that our 
service should do honor to the service 
and the sacrifice that they have made. 
INFLATION 
Madam President, for about the past 
year, our current President, President 
Biden, and many of the Democrats in 
the House and the Senate—where the 
Democrats are in charge of each of 
those Chambers—they have spent a 
great deal of time blaming everyone 
but themselves for the historic levels 
of inflation that have ruined the econ-
omy and made the American people 
very nervous about what two more 
years of this ‘‘Build Back Broke’’ agen-
da would mean for them. 
I have said before that Tennesseans 
feel like they have no idea who is in 
control in this country, over in the 
White House, or, indeed, if anyone over 
at the White House is in control in this 
country. 
And if you look at all the various 
characters featured in Biden’s inflation 
blame game, you might be tempted to 
think that Biden himself is wondering 
the very same thing: Who is in control? 
Who is calling the shots? 
But the truth is that no one in the 
White House is confused or shocked by 
how bad things have gotten. They 
know exactly how we got here because 
they did it because every step they 
took along the way was a deliberate at-
tempt to reject common sense and ma-
nipulate the people into accepting a 
radical economic agenda. 
Well, in July of last year, President 
Biden 
insisted 
that 
inflation 
was 
‘‘transitory’’ and that if we could just 
bring on a little bit more time and a 
little bit more effort and hang in there 
a little bit longer, you know what, ev-
erything was going to be just fine. 
He didn’t want the people to panic 
and start questioning the narrative 
that the White House was pushing for-
ward every single day. 
Surprising no one, that argument 
didn’t fly. The people weren’t buying 
it. So in October, suddenly, not only 
was inflation a problem, but, guess 
what, it was former President Trump’s 
fault. That is right—not this adminis-
tration’s fault, not the Democrats’, not 
President 
Biden, 
it 
was 
President 
Trump’s fault. 
Well, the American people, they 
weren’t 
having 
that 
either. 
They 
weren’t buying that line, and over the 
next 5 months, the COVID–19 pan-
demic, so-called global challenges, sup-
ply chain, and, of course, Vladimir 
Putin, and then Senate Republicans— 
everybody took a turn in the blame 
game seat for President Biden and the 
White House. It was everybody’s fault 
but theirs. 
Isn’t that absolutely amazing? Just 
amazing. The people in control of ev-
erything—the House, the Senate, the 
executive branch, the White House, 
controlling it all—they had nothing to 
do with this, they want you to believe. 
Well, yes, indeed, they had every-
thing to do with it. 
So last month, the Democrats had 
exhausted this rotation of villains, as 
they like to call it. Well, they panicked 
and they decided, once again, that they 
had to just go out here and convince 
the American people that, yes, indeed, 
inflation was transitory. It was going 
to be short-lived. It was only 81⁄2 per-
cent, they would say—only. 
But go fill up the car. Go to the gro-
cery store. You know they are wrong. 
Well, unfortunately for Joe Biden, 
the American people are much smarter 
and more in tune with day-to-day life 
than the left has given them credit for. 
This administration is now in dam-
age control mode.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2779 
June 6, 2022 
Last week, Secretary Yellen threw 
up her hands and admitted that the po-
litical narrative on inflation that she 
enabled put us on the road to economic 
collapse. 
On the same day, President Biden 
published an op-ed in the Wall Street 
Journal, blaming Trump and Putin for 
his problems before touting the same 
radical policies the American people 
have already rejected. 
What we are seeing now is more than 
just the consequences of a failed polit-
ical maneuver. It is the collapse of an 
economic philosophy the Democrats in-
sisted was far superior to anything 
their political opponents would ever 
come up with. 
And the Democrats’ response to this 
is what, exactly? To say, well, they are 
sorry. Then they just double down. 
They just keep on going. Not exactly a 
plot twist for this administration. 
They intend to double down on their 
failed policies. 
At this point in Biden’s blame game, 
Tennesseans are accustomed to watch-
ing the administration fail, but that 
doesn’t mean that they are not paying 
attention to the details and the steps 
this administration is taking. 
Tennesseans are nervous, stressed 
out. They feel like everything is out of 
control and nobody in the White House 
really cares about it. 
As I have been out, about, and around 
the State, inflation, the price at the 
pump, the price at the grocery store, 
the cost of fertilizers for our farm com-
munity, logistics costs, the cost of 
clothing, the cost of shoes and equip-
ment for the kids to go to summer 
camp, fees at summer camp—every-
thing is going up. Everything. 
And who do people blame for this? 
They blame this administration. They 
know that in June of 2020, a gallon of 
gas was $2.17. This week in Tennessee, 
that gallon of gas is $4.47. That is far 
more than 8 percent inflation. Coffee is 
up 143 percent. Ground beef is up, buns 
are up, eggs are up, bread is up. Every-
body is complaining about what it 
costs to live every single day. 
The playbook really is pretty simple 
on this. What this administration is 
doing is just putting it all on our debt 
line. But you know what, the American 
people know they can’t afford this, and 
they know that their children cannot 
afford this. They know that the pro-
grams that this administration is push-
ing—big, expensive programs—the reg-
ulations that they are putting in 
place—primarily, of the 69 regulations 
that President Biden has enacted since 
he took office—69 regulations he has 
done—the majority of those are aimed 
at the energy sector. People know that 
it is all taxpayer money this adminis-
tration is spending, and the taxpayers 
cannot afford this out-of-control spend-
ing spree, and they know that they 
cannot afford this far-left socialistic 
turn in this administration and in the 
policies of my Democratic colleagues. 
Now, why is this? It is because the 
Democrats’ vision for the future isn’t 
compatible with what families want for 
their future. They look at what Joe 
Biden is offering—more government 
control, less parental control; more 
government control, hardship on small 
businesses; more government control, 
less freedom to spend your hard-earned 
money—and they are saying: This is 
not what we want. 
So I think that when I listen to Ten-
nesseans and when I talk with them 
about their hopes and dreams about 
what they want to see for the future, 
for their children, they are not in a jo-
vial mood. They are in a very serious 
mood. They are confused that this ad-
ministration and Democrats would go 
this far left and risk—and risk—good 
will. And I think that the American 
people have figured out we are com-
pletely on the wrong track with this 
administration’s 
policies, 
and 
they 
have figured out that these policies are 
not a path to prosperity. They are a 
path to government control, and I 
think that many of my Democratic col-
leagues know and realize that. Cer-
tainly, Secretary Yellen has let us 
know that she realizes that, and prob-
ably the President knows it. But in-
stead of saying: Stop—full stop—the 
Democrats 
have 
chosen 
to 
double 
down.

SOLAR TARIFFS 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am 
grateful to be recognized, especially 
with the Presiding Officer in the Chair 
for the beginning of this talk, because 
I just wanted to come out here and 
mention that the last time I spoke on 
the floor, I spoke about the Depart-
ment of Commerce’s investigation on 
solar tariffs and the ways in which it 
was destroying Colorado’s solar indus-
try.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2780 
June 6, 2022 
And I am very pleased to report, be-
cause of the efforts of the Presiding Of-
ficer and others, that President Biden 
announced today that he is going to 
waive any solar tariffs from that inves-
tigation for 2 years. That is great news 
for Colorado and New Mexico. It will 
give Colorado solar companies the cer-
tainty they need to advance new 
projects, expand their businesses, and 
help us meet our climate goals. 
So I just want to say a word of grati-
tude to the Biden administration for 
listening and for making adjustments 
to what they were doing that I think 
are going to benefit American workers 
and American jobs. 
INCOME INEQUALITY 
Mr. President, this evening I am ac-
tually coming to the floor to speak 
about a different subject. 
I saw a report over the weekend, Mr. 
President, that President Biden plans 
to cancel a significant amount of stu-
dent college debt, and I think it is very 
important that, before he does that, he 
considers several factors. One is to con-
sider how we got in this sorry state 
that we are in. How did we arrive in 
this sorry state? How do we put an end 
to the worst parts of our broken lend-
ing system? And really importantly— 
and I think fundamentally—how do we 
create new pathways to a living wage 
for the 70 percent of Americans who 
don’t go to college—importantly, how 
to create new pathways to a living 
wage for the 70 percent of Americans 
who don’t go to college. 
And I think it is important for us, 
when we are thinking about things like 
this potential policy by the Biden ad-
ministration, to understand the con-
text in which this is happening. For 50 
years, we have had an economy in this 
country that has worked really well for 
the top 10 percent and poorly for every-
body else. 
There were decades and decades and 
decades that when the economy grew, 
it grew for everybody. But for the last 
50 years, when the economy has grown, 
it has grown for the wealthiest people 
in our country at the expense of every-
body else. That has been the effect of 
technology. It has been the effect of 
globalization. 
I think it is long past time for us to 
admit that a lot of the theories that we 
told ourselves about the importance of 
privileging people who wanted to make 
stuff as cheaply as possible in China 
over creating productive work here in 
the United States—like the solar jobs 
that you and I have been talking 
about—you know, it is time for us to 
think about that and to consider what 
it would look like to have an economy 
that when it grew, it actually grew for 
everybody, not just the people at the 
very top. 
I don’t think there is any way that, if 
we have another 50 years like the last 
50 years, we are going to be able to sus-
tain our democracy. That is how im-
portant this is. Because when people 
lose a sense of opportunity no matter 
how hard they work, that is when 
somebody shows up and says: I alone 
can fix it. You don’t need a democracy. 
You don’t need the rule of law. 
And that is what we are struggling 
with. Economic mobility has vanished 
in the United States. And, as a former 
school superintendent of the Denver 
public schools, I am deeply saddened to 
say on this floor that our education 
system, far from liberating people from 
their economic circumstances, is actu-
ally ratifying those economic cir-
cumstances. It is compounding the in-
come inequality that we have instead 
of liberating kids from their parents’ 
incomes, because the best predictor of 
your quality of education is the income 
that your parents make, to the point of 
ruthlessness. And as the rungs of the 
economic ladder have grown wider over 
time, Americans have found it harder 
and harder and harder to earn a living 
wage with just a high school degree. 
Michael Sandel, who has written a 
book, which I would recommend every-
body read, called ‘‘The Tyranny of 
Merit,’’ argues in his book that rather 
than fighting for an economy that ac-
tually works for everybody—more op-
portunity, less income inequality— 
American politicians have argued, in-
stead, that the best hedge against eco-
nomic catastrophe in a global economy 
is to get a college degree. And, to be 
fair, this sometimes works. The 30 per-
cent of Americans who graduate with a 
4-year degree go on to earn, on average, 
1.2 million more dollars, Mr. President, 
over their lifetime than Americans who 
only complete high school. 
The tragic exception to that—the 
tragic exception to that are Black col-
lege graduates who, as a result of rac-
ism in this country, earn, on average, 
less than White high school graduates. 
Let me just pause on that for a second, 
just pause on that for a second. On av-
erage, if you go to college in this coun-
try, you will earn $1.2 million more 
than your fellow citizens who just have 
a high school degree, unless you are a 
Black American, in which case, on av-
erage, you will earn less than White 
high school students. I can’t think of a 
more profound indictment of our soci-
ety than that. 
And as more and more Americans ap-
plied to college to get ahead in an 
economy where they couldn’t find 
other ways of getting ahead, my gen-
eration of taxpayers, my generation of 
citizens, unlike our parents, unlike our 
grandparents, refused to adequately 
fund our public colleges and univer-
sities. Instead, we passed along tuition 
increases and tuition itself to students 
and their families. We said: It is your 
responsibility, even though we grew up 
in a system where it was all of our re-
sponsibility to make sure that public 
education was well-supported—public 
higher education was well-supported in 
this country. 
So we passed along these increases to 
students, even though it was based on 
no growth in their real income. They 
had no choice but to finance their col-
lege years through the Federal student 
loan program. That was the answer; 
that was the financing mechanism. 
And with no incentive to lower costs, 
colleges and universities just jacked up 
the rates. They increased tuition. And 
Washington bankrolled these tuition 
hikes by financing loans to attend 
nearly any institution regardless of 
cost, quality, or student outcomes. As 
a result, the cost of college, not sur-
prisingly, has skyrocketed over the 
last 40 years. 
The fundamental problem we have 
here is that college costs too much. It 
is too expensive. In 1980, the price to 
attend a four-year college full-time 
was $10,000 a year, roughly, including 
tuition, fees, room and board. Forty 
years later, the total price was $28,775 
in real dollars, a 180-percent increase 
over that time. 
Today, over 45 million Americans, as 
a result, are saddled with student loan 
debt—disproportionately, students of 
color. In my townhalls, many Colo-
radans tell me these loans have made 
their lives miserable. It has devastated 
their credit score, made it harder to 
purchase homes, start a business, or 
pay for childcare, or ever move out of 
your parents’ basement. 
The same is true for many people in 
my townhalls who never went to col-
lege and who struggled to afford hous-
ing and healthcare or childcare, the 
building blocks of a middle-class life. I 
haven’t seen any reports that Presi-
dent Biden plans to excuse their debt— 
these people on average making $1.2 
million less than people that got a col-
lege degree—their medical debt or the 
debt that they had to go into just to 
keep a roof over their head in this sav-
age economy. 
But now President Biden is consid-
ering whether to forgive $10,000 of stu-
dent loan debt for Americans who 
earned less than $150,000 last year, 
$300,000 for married families filing 
jointly. According to the Committee 
for Responsible Federal Budget, this 
would cost $200 billion. There are all 
kinds of ways you can spend $200 bil-
lion. You can extend the enhanced 
Child Tax Credit for 2 years, cut child-
hood poverty in half for 2 years, reduce 
childhood hunger by a quarter. We did 
that the last 6 months of the year last 
year. You could give every teacher in 
America a $6,000 raise for a decade for 
$200 billion. You could begin to tackle 
the climate crisis, which is devastating 
my State and your State, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
But if you are going to spend $200 bil-
lion or $230 billion to cancel student 
loan debt, we need to do it in a way 
that reaches those who need it most 
and reforms the underlying system 
that got us here in the first place; oth-
erwise, there is no reason to do it be-
cause there are kids that are going to 
start school next year. Otherwise, we 
are simply passing along this injustice 
to another generation of college stu-
dents. 
There is no shortage of ideas where 
we can start. We should target the

$10,000 of debt relief to low- and middle- 
income borrowers. By that, I mean 
households earning the State median 
income or less. 
We should consider additional debt 
relief for student borrowers who re-
ceived Pell grants while they went to 
school because that is a proxy for their 
income. We should reform the Public 
Service Loan Forgiveness program, 
which forgives Federal loans after 10 
years of working in public service as a 
teacher, a firefighter, or a servicemem-
ber. 
At a minimum, we should expand the 
program to more borrowers so more 
borrowers can take advantage of it. Be-
yond that, we should forgive their 
loans after 5 years instead of 10 years. 
We are losing 50 percent of the teachers 
from the profession in the first 5 years 
in this country. We should strengthen 
the income-driven repayment program 
to help low- and middle-income bor-
rowers, for example, by cutting redtape 
and simplifying the program so it is 
simpler for people to access, providing 
relief retroactively for low-income bor-
rowers who qualify for that program 
but never enrolled. 
And, finally, we should increase the 
maximum Pell grant so low- and mid-
dle-income borrowers don’t need to 
take on so much debt in the first place 
to get an education. They are having to 
bear a burden that no other generation 
of Americans have had to bear, and it 
is not their fault. 
Americans deserve more than just 
student debt relief, an across-the-board 
cancellation of college debt does noth-
ing to address the absurd cost of col-
lege or fix our broken student loan pro-
gram. It offers nothing to Americans 
who paid off their college debts or 
those who chose a lower-priced college 
to go to as a way of avoiding going into 
debt or taking on debt. It ignores— 
really important—it ignores the major-
ity of Americans who never went to 
college, some of whom have debts that 
are just as staggering and just as un-
fair, to say nothing of the 11 million 
poor children in this country who at-
tend schools that are so terrible that 
they never had a chance at a college 
degree, much less a living wage. 
As a former urban school super-
intendent, I tell you, I have worked on 
these challenges for years. We have to 
revolutionize our public education to 
prepare our children for the 21st cen-
tury. That is a lot easier said than 
done. In too many parts of the country, 
we are actually headed in the wrong di-
rection. Our K–12 schools, as designed, 
will do little to make up for our failed 
economic policies, especially for kids 
living in poverty. And in the mean-
time, we need an economic vision for 
this country—for our country—that is 
more robust than making stuff, as I 
said, as cheaply as possible in China. 
We need to make things again in this 
country so we can pay Americans a liv-
ing wage. We need to fight for higher 
wages for people who do things like 
taking care of our kids or our parents— 
service jobs that can’t be shipped over-
seas but deserve to be compensated 
fairly in this country. 
All of this is going to take time, but 
we can start now by strengthening 
workforce training programs so high 
school graduates—so high school grad-
uates—have a better chance to earn a 
living wage in today’s economy. I don’t 
think we should graduate from high 
school—that is what a high school di-
ploma should mean, that you are able 
to earn a living wage, not just a min-
imum wage in your community. 
We have examples of that now in Col-
orado where kids are doing internships, 
you know, 2 days a week. They are 
being paid to do those apprenticeships 
and go to school 3 days a week, and 
when they graduate, there is a job with 
a living wage waiting for them. A sys-
tem like that would transform the 
lives of millions of Americans. It would 
transform the American economy and 
we should support partnerships like 
that, you know, between the private 
sector and labor that provides students 
high-quality 
paying 
apprenticeships 
while they are in high school. 
Senator RUBIO and I have suggested 
we should allow high school students 
to use Pell grants, not only to pursue 
college, but to pursue shorter-term, 
high-quality credentials that can boost 
their wages in the near term. 
I just met with a collection of people 
in Denver. It was one of the most in-
spiring things I have seen in a long 
time. These are people who have min-
imum wage jobs—never lived independ-
ently or had roommates—and, now, be-
cause they have gotten just a little bit 
of credentials in over 3 or 4 months of 
training, they are living independent 
lives, and they can see a future beyond 
just paying yesterday’s bills. 
The bigger question that should ani-
mate us on the floor isn’t how much 
student debt to cancel but how to cre-
ate a pathway to economic security for 
every American who graduates from 
high school, including those who don’t 
go get a 4-year degree. It should be how 
to build an economy that when it 
grows, it grows forever, not just the 
top 10 percent; it should be how to give 
every American child real opportuni-
ties to contribute to this democracy 
and to our society. That should be the 
level of our ambition on this floor, and 
I am prepared to work with any of my 
colleagues to achieve that. 
I yield the floor.

estimated cost was $600 million. Major De-
fense Equipment (MDE) constituted $300 mil-
lion of this total. 
On November 12, 2019, Congress was noti-
fied by Congressional certification trans-
mittal number 1B–19, of the possible sale 
under Section 36(b)(5)(A) of the Arms Export 
Control Act of four (4) AGM–114R Hellfire 
missiles; and seven (7) Link 16 Multifunc-
tional Information Distribution Systems— 
Low Volume Terminals (MIDS–LVT) Block 
Upgrade Two terminals. The addition of 
these items resulted in a net increase in 
MDE cost of $2 million. The total case value 
remained $600 million. 
On March 16, 2021, Congress was notified by 
Congressional certification transmittal num-
ber OI–21, of the inclusion of an additional: 
thirty-two (32) AGM–114R Hellfire missiles; 
and one (1) Link 16 MIDS–LVT Block Up-
grade Two terminal. This transmittal also 
reported an administrative change to correct 
the nomenclature of the two (2) AGM–114 
Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM) erro-
neously notified as ‘‘M36–E9’’ to accurately 
reflect ‘‘M36–E8.’’ The addition of the new 
items resulted in a net increase in MDE of $4 
million. The total case value remained $600 
million. 
This transmittal reports the replacement 
of the previously notified eight (8) MIDS– 
LVT Block Upgrade Two terminals (MDE) 
with eight (8) Multifunctional Information 
Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio 
System (MIDS JTRS) (MDE). The replace-
ment will result in a net increase in MDE of 
$4 million. The total case value will remain 
$600 million. 
(iv) Significance: The proposed sale is nec-
essary for Greece’s additional MH–60R air-
craft to execute primary anti-submarine and 
anti-surface warfare missions, which will im-
prove their capability to meet current and 
future threats from enemy weapon systems. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will 
support U.S. foreign policy and national se-
curity objectives by helping to improve the 
security of a NATO ally, which is an impor-
tant partner for political stability and eco-
nomic progress in Europe. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: MIDS JTRS 
is a secure data and voice communication 
network using Link 16 architecture. MIDS 
JTRS provides a high capacity, low latency 
internet protocol-based waveform that can 
quickly transmit large amounts of data. 
With Link 16, aircraft can exchange their 
tactical picture in near-real time. Link 16 
equipment also supports the exchange of text 
messages, imagery data and provides two 
channels of digital voice. MIDS JTRS con-
tains the capability to enable network cen-
tric capabilities, and improve data commu-
nications leading to a Common Operating 
Picture (COP). 
The overall highest level of classification 
of defense articles, components, and services 
included in this potential sale is SECRET.

with certification and installation in each 
aircraft, and three (3) AN/ALE–47 Counter-
measure Dispensing Systems (one (1) for 
each aircraft and one (1) spare) along with 
integration, certification, and installation 
on each aircraft. These items were to be used 
to equip two (2) of the six (6) total EDA SH– 
60 helicopters. The inclusion of these MDE 
items did not result in a change to the esti-
mated MDE value of $47 million. The total 
estimated case value remained $155 million. 
On June 26, 2018, Congress was notified by 
Congressional certification transmittal num-
ber 0J–18 of the inclusion of eight (8) Embed-
ded Global Positioning Units/Inertial Navi-
gation Systems (EGI) with GPS Selective 
Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) 
and four (4) AN/AAR–47E Missile Warning 
Systems (MWS) (MDE items). Also included 
were four (4) GPS Anti-Jam Systems (GAS– 
1), four (4) AN/ALE–47 Countermeasure Dis-
pensing Systems and eight (8) AN/ARC– 
210(V) RT–1990A(C) radios. These items were 
to be used to equip the remaining four (4) of 
the original six (6) total EDA SH–60F heli-
copters. The estimated value of the addi-
tional MDE items was $4.26 million, but the 
addition did not result in a change to the es-
timated MDE value of $47 million. The total 
estimated case value remained $155 million. 
On November 16, 2018, Congress was noti-
fied by Congressional certification trans-
mittal number 0T–18 of the inclusion of four 
(4) additional EDA SH–60F helicopters (two 
flyable/two 
spares 
non-flying), 
including 
eight (8) T700–GE–401 C engines (installed). 
Two (2) aircraft were to be equipped with the 
following additional systems: four (4) EGIs 
with GPS SAASM, two (2) AN/AAR–47E MWS 
(both items MDE); two (2) GAS-1s, two (2) 
AN/ALE–47 Countermeasure Dispensing Sys-
tems, and four (4) 
AN/ARC–210(V) 
RT– 
1990A(C) radios. The estimated value of the 
additional MDE items was $11.6 million, but 
the addition did not result in a change to the 
estimated MDE value of $47 million. The 
total estimated case value remained $155 
million. 
On May 21, 2019, Congress was notified by 
Congressional certification transmittal num-
ber 0K–19 of an increase in total case value 
that had not been recently reevaluated. The 
total case value increase was based on the 
following factors. The previous value was 
calculated before the open and inspect phase 
of the first aircraft. As retired aircraft 
stored at the Aerospace Maintenance and Re-
generation Group (AMARG), Spain’s aircraft 
contained more damage that could be discov-
ered only during a full teardown and inspec-
tion, and the last aircraft had been demili-
tarized and assessed in overall poor condi-
tion with a planned date to be shredded. Re-
turning these aircraft to flight condition re-
quired extensive work and greater expense 
than anticipated. There was also a cost in-
crease to provide for return-and-repair serv-
ices, engineering hours, and spare parts. No 
additional MDE was added and the estimated 
MDE value remained $47 million. The esti-
mated additional non-MDE value increased 
by $61 million. The total estimated case 
value increased to $216 million. 
On January 14, 2020, Congress was notified 
by Congressional certification transmittal 
number 0A–20 of an additional four (4) Em-
bedded 
Global 
Positioning 
Units/Inertial 
Navigation Systems (EGIs) with GPS Selec-
tive 
Availability 
Anti-Spoofing 
Module 
(SAASM). The estimated MDE value was $1 
million, for a total estimated MDE value of 
$48 million. The total estimated case value 
increased to $217 million. 
On September 7, 2021, Congress was noti-
fied by Congressional certification trans-
mittal number 0S–21 of the inclusion of three 
(3) 7.62MM M240D Machine Guns. The total 
estimated MDE value increased to $48.7 mil-
lion. The total estimated case value in-
creased to $217.7 million. 
This transmittal reports the inclusion of 
six (6) additional 7.62MM M240D Machine 
Guns (MDE). The estimated value of these 
items is $1 million. The total estimated MDE 
value will increase to $49.7 million. The total 
case value will increase to $218.7 million. 
(iv) Significance: The proposed articles and 
services will augment the Spanish Navy’s 
multi-mission, multi-role helicopters to per-
form humanitarian missions, search and res-
cue, medical evacuations, firefighting, and 
anti-piracy efforts. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity of the United States by improving the 
security of a NATO ally, which is an impor-
tant force for political stability and eco-
nomic progress in Europe. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensi-
tivity of Technology Statement contained in 
the original notification applies to items re-
ported here. 
The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is UNCLASSI-
FIED.

June 3, 2022.

TRIBUTE TO MILLIE BROTHER 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Millie Brother, the 
founder of Children of Deaf Adults, also 
known as CODA. As the name implies, 
CODA is an international group that 
works to support children of deaf 
adults, including helping them pursue 
higher education. 
Millie grew up in Palo Alto, CA, 
where I first met her in high school. 
She was raised in a household with two 
deaf parents and a hearing sister. De-
scribing her life moving between the 
deaf and hearing worlds, Millie said ‘‘I 
felt comfortable in both but not fully 
immersed in either. The CODA world 
would become my third option where I 
felt balance between my Deaf and hear-
ing cultural experiences.’’ 
After Millie finished her graduate 
program at Gallaudet University, she 
established CODA in 1983. It began its 
work to serve both the hearing and 
nonhearing community. 
Millie’s vision and leadership has al-
lowed CODA to grow from a small, 
grassroots organization to a worldwide 
entity 
with 
strong 
familial 
bonds 
reaching across global borders, inter-
national languages, and societal bound-
aries. It has become a respected, well- 
regarded, and vital resource for fami-
lies that navigate both the hearing and 
deaf world. 
CODA works to connect children of 
deaf parents and support them by orga-
nizing conferences and retreats, as well 
as providing scholarships and financial 
aid. The Millie Brother Scholarship is 
an annual financial award given to 
hearing children of deaf adults to help 
them pursue their postsecondary edu-
cation. Over the past few years, schol-
arships have been awarded to students 
pursuing postsecondary educational op-
portunities in Ghana, Nigeria, South 
Africa, England, New Zealand, Zambia, 
and the United States. 
I want to express my profound appre-
ciation to Millie Brother for her life’s 
work, dedication, and advocacy for 
CODAs around the world. The recent 
Academy 
Award-winning 
movie 
‘‘CODA’’ underscored the numerous 
challenges facing families with deaf 
parents and hearing children. Millie 
Brother personally understood those 
challenges and used them as fuel to 
create a global organization that pro-
vides support, compassion, and friend-
ship to CODAs everywhere.

TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE 
WETHERTON 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, every 
Member of Congress vividly remembers 
his or her path toward engagement in 
our government. Some have been more 
circuitous than others, but we all re-
member how that spark was ignited 
and how action ensued. 
Katherine Wetherton, a freshman at 
the University of Louisville, hopes to 
kindle that passion for civic engage-
ment in young women, and part of her 
strategy was to write a book targeted 
toward middle and high school stu-
dents entitled, ‘‘She Rocks the Vote.’’ 
She distributes it through the seminars 
and workshops she conducts for stu-
dents and at the Little Free Library 
that she built and installed in her 
hometown in Oldham County. 
A results-focused young woman, Kate 
was active in Girl Scouts for 13 years 
and completed her Girl Scout Gold 
Award, which is achieved by only about 
5 percent of Girl Scouts. And while she

RECOGNIZING COX’S HONEY 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize 
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to 
honor Cox’s Honey as the Idaho Small 
Business of the Month for June 2022. 
In 1927, Orville S. Cox began man-
aging beehives to support his small 
vegetable stand on the road to Yellow-
stone in Shelley. Honey sales quickly 
took off and Cox’s Honey was born. 
Now in its third generation, the Cox 
family 
continues 
Orville’s 
original 
honey straining process to deliver the 
same quality product he created nearly 
100 years ago. 
Today, Cox’s Honey’s 16 employees 
package over a million pounds of raw, 
unfiltered clover honey each year. 
Their creamed honey has won several 
competitions and earned national rec-
ognition for its consistency and flavor. 
Cox’s Honey prides itself on maintain-
ing the integrity of honey’s healthy 
pollens, 
enzymes, 
and 
vitamins 
throughout processing, ensuring they 
deliver only pure products to their cus-
tomers. 
Cox’s Honey contributes more than 
just a sweet treat to the community as 
sponsors of local athletics, supporters 
of Shelley High School, and active par-
ticipants in local affairs and events. 
Alongside 
their 
national 
customer 
base, the Shelley and surrounding 
area’s support has allowed Cox’s Honey 
to open a new retail sales floor this 
month to accommodate their growing 
business and expand their product line. 
Cox’s Honey’s continued success is a 
testament to its dedication to a family 
tradition that protects our State’s bees 
and crops and shares one of Idaho’s 
longest lasting products with the Na-
tion. 
Congratulations to the Cox family 
and all of the employees at Cox’s 
Honey for being selected as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for June 
2022. Thank you for serving Idaho as 
small 
business 
owners 
and 
entre-
preneurs. You make our great State 
proud, and I look forward to your con-
tinued growth and success.∑

TRIBUTE TO THE REV. DR. 
PHILLIP WEBSTER DAVIS, SR. 
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to recognize the 100th birthday of 
my constituent the Reverend Doctor 
Phillip Webster Davis, Sr. It is my 
pleasure to celebrate him on this spe-
cial occasion and to share the details of 
his extraordinary life, his dedication to 
our community, and his service to our 
country. 
The Rev. Dr. Davis grew up in a 
household guided by family and faith. 
He was born the seventh of eight sons— 
and even at an early age, he quickly 
learned the values of brotherhood, 
community, loyalty, and love. His fa-
ther, Reverend James William Davis, 
pastored at Mt. Calvary Baptist Church 
in Rockville, and together with his 
wife Mary, the older Reverend Davis 
instilled in his children many core 
teachings of the scriptures, among 
them: love thy neighbor, pursue a life 
of service, and strive to achieve your 
inner potential. 
The Rev. Dr. Davis marshalled the 
wisdom of those core teachings to steer 
the course of his extraordinary life and 
career. The arc of his career began in 
the Armed Services. In 1944, the Rev. 
Dr. Davis was drafted into the U.S. 
Army and served in the New Guinea 
and Philippines region during World 
War II. In a moment of crisis, he was 
called by his country to fight back 
against the forces of fascism and total-
itarianism that had pulled the world 
into war—and he answered that call 
with action. The State of Maryland is 
deeply proud of the Rev. Dr. Davis’ 
service to our country, and our entire 
Nation is grateful for his commitment 
to defending freedom everywhere. 
After he was honorably discharged 
from the Army, the Rev. Dr. Davis en-
tered the private sector and owned sev-
eral businesses over the years, includ-
ing a restaurant, a barber shop, a char-
ter bus service, and an automotive 
body shop. 
The Rev. Dr. Davis has been many 
things: a protector of freedom overseas, 
a community leader at home, an entre-
preneur, and a business owner. But 
today, the Rev. Dr. Davis is most well- 
known throughout Marylander as the 
founder and former senior pastor of the 
Inter-Denominational Church of God. 
In building that community from the 
ground up, the Rev. Dr. Davis set out 
to grow a congregation that would ac-
cept all people, regardless of back-
ground and culture. His vision has been 
realized through the many dedicated 
parishioners of the Inter-Denomina-
tional Church of God, who continue 
working together to create an inclusive 
community of worship. After 38 years 
of exceptional service, the Rev. Dr. 
Davis stepped down as senior pastor 
during the week of his 90th birthday. 
Now, his legacy lives on under new 
leadership that will sustain and build 
on the Rev. Dr. Davis’ vision for years 
to come. 
As a result of the Rev. Dr. Davis’s 
work in the ministry and community, 
he has received numerous recognitions 
and honors. But despite these achieve-
ments, the Rev. Dr. Davis has always 
stayed humble and remained true to 
those guiding principles of family and 
faith that he first learned a young boy 
growing up in Rockville. To the Rev. 
Dr. Davis, the greatest recognition he 
could ever receive is in knowing he is 
the best husband and the best father to 
five children, six grandchildren, and 
one great-grandchild. 
The Rockville community, the Mary-
land community, and our country are 
indebted to Rev. Dr. Davis for his faith-
ful service. On his 100th birthday, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in celebrating 
this extraordinary milestone and send-
ing our deepest gratitude to the Rev. 
Dr. Phillip Webster Davis, Sr., for all 
he has done.∑

may be. An affirmative vote of two-thirds of 
the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and 
sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal 
of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order 
raised under this subsection. 
(3) DEFINITION OF AN EMERGENCY DESIGNA-

further amendment shall consist of only that 
portion of the conference report or House 
amendment, as the case may be, not so 
stricken. Any such motion in the Senate 
shall be debatable. In any case in which such

covered bill or joint resolution. 
SEC. 3006. BREAKDOWN OF COST ESTIMATES BY 
BUDGET FUNCTION.

SEC. 3007. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TREAT-
MENT OF REDUCTION OF APPRO-
PRIATIONS 
LEVELS 
TO 
ACHIEVE 
SAVINGS. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) H. Con. Res. 448 (96th Congress), the 
concurrent resolution on the budget for fis-
cal year 1981, gave authorizing committees 
reconciliation instructions which amounted 
to approximately two-thirds of the savings 
required under reconciliation. 
(2) The language in H. Con. Res. 448 re-
sulted in a debate about how reconciling dis-
cretionary spending programs could be in 
order given that authorizations of appropria-
tions for programs did not actually change 
spending and the programs authorized would 
be funded through later annual appropria-
tion. The staff of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate and the counsel to the 
Majority Leader advised that upon consulta-
tion with the Parliamentarian, the original 
instructions on discretionary spending would 
be out of order because of the phrase, ‘‘to 
modify programs’’. This was seen as too 
broad and programs could be modified with-
out resulting in changes to their future ap-
propriations. 
(3) To rectify this violation, the Com-
mittee on the Budget of the Senate reported 
S. Con. Res. 9 (97th Congress), revising the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2792 
June 6, 2022 
congressional budget for the United States 
Government for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 
1983, to include reconciliation, which revised 
the language in the reconciliation instruc-
tions to change entitlement law and ‘‘to re-
port changes in laws within the jurisdiction 
of that committee sufficient to reduce appro-
priations levels so as to achieve savings’’. 
(4) This was understood to mean changes in 
authorization language of discretionary pro-
grams would be permissible under reconcili-
ation procedures provided such changes in 
law would have the result in affecting a 
change in later outlays derived from future 
appropriations. Further it was understood 
that a change in authorization language that 
caused a change in later outlays was consid-
ered to be a change in outlays for the pur-
pose of reconciliation. 
(5) On April 2, 1981, the Senate voted 88 to 
10 to approve S. Con. Res. 9 with the modi-
fied reconciliation language. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that committees reporting 
changes in laws within the jurisdiction of 
that committee sufficient to reduce appro-
priations levels so as to achieve savings shall 
be considered to be changes in outlays for 
the purpose of enforcing the prohibition on 
extraneous matters in reconciliation bills. 
SEC. 3008. PROHIBITION ON PREEMPTIVE WAIV-
ERS. 
In the Senate, it shall not be in order to 
move to waive or suspend a point of order 
under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 
U.S.C. 621 et seq.) or any concurrent resolu-
tion on the budget with respect to a bill, 
joint 
resolution, 
motion, 
amendment, 
amendment between the Houses, or con-
ference report unless the point of order has 
been specifically raised by a Senator. 
SEC. 3009. ADJUSTMENTS FOR LEGISLATION RE-
DUCING APPROPRIATIONS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions in effect under section 302(a) of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 
633(a)) and the allocations of a committee or 
committees, aggregates, and other appro-
priate levels in this resolution for any bill or 
joint resolution considered pursuant to sec-
tion 2001 containing the recommendations of 
one or more committees, or for one or more 
amendments to, a conference report on, or 
an amendment between the Houses in rela-
tion to such a bill or joint resolution, by the 
amounts necessary to accommodate the re-
duction in the amount of discretionary ap-
propriations for a fiscal year caused by the 
measure. 
SEC. 3010. ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT LEGISLA-
TION NOT INCLUDED IN THE BASE-
LINE. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may make adjustments 
to the levels and allocations in this resolu-
tion to reflect legislation enacted before the 
date on which this resolution is agreed to by 
Congress that is not incorporated in the 
baseline underlying the Congressional Budg-
et Office’s July 2021 update to the Budget 
and Economic Outlook: 2021 to 2031. 
SEC. 3011. AUTHORITY. 
Congress adopts this title under the au-
thority under section 301(b)(4) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 
632(b)(4)). 
SEC. 3012. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS. 
Congress adopts the provisions of this 
title— 
(1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power 
of the Senate, and as such they shall be con-
sidered as part of the rules of the Senate and 
such rules shall supersede other rules only to 
the extent that they are inconsistent with 
such other rules; and 
(2) with full recognition of the constitu-
tional right of the Senate to change those 
rules at any time, in the same manner, and 
to the same extent as is the case of any other 
rule of the Senate.

f 
D-DAY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today 
is a very important day in American 
history, June 6, the anniversary of D- 
day. One of the most important and 
consequential battles of World War II 
occurred on that day. 
Every year I have served in this 
body, I have a practice of coming to 
the floor and reciting the famous D-day 
Prayer that Franklin D. Roosevelt de-
livered to the Nation on the morning of 
June 6, 1944. It was a consequential bat-
tle in the sense that it really marks 
the beginning of the end of World War 
II, the beginning of the end of Hitler. It 
is my favorite Presidential statement. 
Seventy-eight 
years 
ago, 
as 
the 
American people slept in their beds, 
the greatest naval invasion in history 
began and the Greatest Generation was 
born. On that fateful day, tens of thou-
sands of American soldiers, sailors, and 
airmen joined our allies from around 
the world to begin what General Eisen-
hower called the ‘‘Great Crusade,’’ one 
that sought to free a continent and lib-
erate millions from the grip of tyr-
anny. They came by amphibious land-
ing craft, by gliders laden with men 
and material, by parachutes deployed 
deep behind enemy lines. And on the 
beaches called places like Omaha and 
Utah and at the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, 
they struck a mortal blow to the Nazi 
regime. 
Thousands would give their lives for 
this cause—over 2,500 Americans alone. 
Like many in this Chamber, I have 
seen the American cemeteries there, 
the rows of white crosses and the stars 
of David that go on and on are a stark 
reminder of the price those brave he-
roes paid for all of us. 
These men did not go into battle 
alone. As General Eisenhower said to 
the Allied Expeditionary Force on the 
eve of this risky battle: ‘‘The hopes and 
prayers of liberty loving people every-
where march with you.’’ 
As the battle was engaged, President 
Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the Na-
tion. He did not choose to address the 
American people with one of his trade-
mark fireside chats, nor did he choose 
to use a speech; instead, he delivered 
words of prayer by radio address, as the 
fate of Europe and indeed the entire 
free world hung in the balance. 
It was a powerful prayer that tran-
scended all faiths. I think it captures, 
perhaps better than anything else I 
have ever seen, what we as Americans 
should be most proud of. We are lib-
erators, not conquerors, and it also 
talks about the righteousness of that 
cause. 
This prayer must never be forgotten, 
and that is why I come to the floor, and 
that is why I would like to recite it 
now. 
This is what he said: 
My fellow Americans: 
Last night, when I spoke to you about the 
fall of Rome, I knew at that moment that 
troops of the United States and our allies 
were crossing the Channel in another and 
[yet] greater operation. It has come to pass 
with success thus far. 
And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to 
join with me in prayer: 
Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our na-
tion, this day have set upon a mighty en-
deavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic,

our religion, and our civilization, and to set 
free a suffering humanity. 
Lead them straight and true; give strength 
to their arms, stoutness to their hearts, 
steadfastness in their faith. 
They will need Thy blessings. Their road 
will be long and hard. For the enemy is 
strong. He may hurl back our forces. Success 
may not come with rushing speed, but we 
shall return again and again; and we know 
that by Thy grace, and by the righteousness 
of our cause, our sons will triumph. 
They will be sore tried, by night and by 
day, without rest—until . . . victory is won. 
The darkness will be rent by noise and flame. 
Men’s souls will be shaken with the violences 
of war. 
For these men are lately drawn from the 
ways of peace. They fight not for the lust of 
conquest. They fight to end conquest. They 
fight to liberate. They fight to let justice 
arise, and tolerance and good will among all 
Thy people. They yearn but for the end of 
battle, for their return to the haven of home. 
Some will never return. Embrace these, 
Father, and receive them, Thy heroic serv-
ants into Thy kingdom. 
And for us at home—fathers, mothers, chil-
dren, wives, sisters, and brothers of brave 
men overseas, whose thoughts and prayers 
are ever with them—help us, Almighty God, 
to rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in 
Thee in this hour of great sacrifice. 
Many people have urged that I call the na-
tion into a single day of [special] prayer. But 
because the road is long and the desire is 
great, I ask that our people devote them-
selves in a continuance of prayer. As we rise 
to each new day, and again when each day is 
spent, let the words of prayer be on our lips, 
invoking Thy help to our efforts. 
Give us strength, too—strength in our 
daily tasks, to redouble the contributions we 
make in the physical and the material sup-
port of our armed forces. 
And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the 
long travail, to bear sorrows that may come, 
to 
impart 
our 
courage 
unto 
our 
sons 
wheresoever they may be. 
And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in 
Thee; faith in our sons; faith in each other, 
faith in our united crusade. Let not the 
keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not 
the impacts of temporary events, of tem-
poral matters of but fleeting moment—let 
not these deter us in our unconquerable pur-
pose. 
With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over 
the unholy forces of our enemy. Help us to 
conquer the apostles of greed and racial arro-
gances. Lead us to the saving of our country, 
and with our sister nations into a world 
unity that will spell a sure peace—a peace 
invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy 
men. And a peace that will let all of men live 
in freedom, reaping the just rewards of their 
honest toil. 
Thy will be done, Almighty God. 
Amen. 
Yes, amen. What a powerful state-
ment—one that deserves to be remem-
bered for generations to come. 
By the way, to ensure its place in 
history, back in 2013, shortly after I 
was elected to this body, I introduced 
legislation called the World War II Me-
morial Prayer Act with former Senator 
Mary Landrieu and then after her, Sen-
ator Joe Lieberman. Representative 
BILL
JOHNSON
took the lead in the 
House of Representatives. 
This was legislation that directed the 
Secretary of the Interior to install a 
plaque at or near the World War II Me-
morial on the National Mall here in 
Washington with these words, the 
words of FDR’s D-day prayer. And we 
said no Federal funding would be used 
for this; we would raise the funding pri-
vately. 
It was the Ohio Christian Alliance 
president, Chris Long, who first came 
to me with the idea of a plaque dis-
playing this historic prayer. Since that 
legislation was signed into law in 2014, 
which kicked off the lengthy Com-
memorative Works Act process for 
siting and installing the plaque at the 
Memorial, the Friends of the National 
World War II Memorial and the Na-
tional Park Service have worked to de-
velop and refine the final plaque design 
and receive a variety of approvals from 
the National Park Service, the Com-
mission of Fine Arts, the National Cap-
ital Planning Commission, and others. 
In the meantime, we have gone ahead 
with a beautiful temporary plaque that 
has been in place since 2019 at what is 
called the Circle of Remembrance, 
which is just north of the World War II 
Memorial. 
So if you are here in Washington, go 
to the Mall, see the World War II Me-
morial, which is spectacular. Then look 
to the north and go to the Circle of Re-
membrance, and you will see the pray-
er on display there. By the way, it is 
the only prayer on display on the Na-
tional Mall. 
We hope that the final version of this 
plaque and the Circle of Remembrance 
being remodeled will be done by the 
end of this year. 
The process has been going on for 8 
years, longer than World War II itself 
actually, so we are eager to see that 
final plaque installed, and I know it 
will be. The temporary plaque, by the 
way, was generously donated to the 
Friends of the National World War II 
Memorial with the help of John Nau, 
from Houston, TX, a great patriot, and 
also the Ohio Christian Alliance and 
others who provided funding for this. 
In October 2020, the Lilly Endowment 
provided a $2 million grant for the con-
struction and installation of the final 
plaque, and it is this committed finan-
cial support that will allow the project 
to get across the finish line, even with 
some hurdles. So I thank the Lilly En-
dowment for their support. 
I also want to recognize the tireless 
efforts of the Friends group, especially 
Holly Rotondi, who has led the effort 
in fundraising and coordinating the 
project over the past several years. 
Thank you, Holly. 
D-day was a day of tremendous loss 
and also monumental triumph. Those 
who lost their lives that day did not 
die in vain. The fate of the free world 
rested on their shoulders. Those brave 
young men, many Americans, charging 
the beaches of Normandy, and Presi-
dent 
Roosevelt’s 
prayer 
that 
day 
helped to comfort a nation in a time of 
great uncertainty. I am glad that his 
words will soon take their proper place 
in our memorial to the war that 
changed the course of history. 
I yield the floor.
