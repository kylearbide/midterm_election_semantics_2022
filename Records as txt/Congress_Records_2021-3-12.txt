PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, humbly I beseech You 
to receive each and every prayer I offer 
as one grounded in love for You and 
Your truth. In submitting myself to 
Your will to serve in these hallowed 
Halls, may the words of my mouth and 
the meditations of my heart be accept-
able to You. 
Search my heart and forgive my hid-
den faults. Convict me for any malice 
or offense that I may inadvertently in-
flict on those whom You have called 
me to serve. 
Instead, allow my prayers to reflect a 
deep yearning for the welfare and wis-
dom of all for whom I am privileged to 
serve alongside. Intercede in the falli-
bility of my speech, through the power 
of Your spirit that what is given in 
love may be received with grace. And 
when my words are misconstrued, may 
Your spirit bring clarity. And should 
truth cause hurt, may Your spirit be 
the mediator of our reconciliation in 
accordance with Your will. 
O Lord, our rock and our Redeemer, 
may this prayer reflect the desires of 
all those who pray with me. And we 
offer this prayer to You in the strength 
of Your name. 
Amen.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased that the Senate has passed and the 
House is now expected to re-pass the ‘‘Amer-
ican Rescue Plan Act of 2021’’ (H.R. 1319), 
for President Biden to sign into law. 
This critical legislation provides federal relief 
totaling more than $218 billion to state govern-
ments and more than $140 billion to county 
and municipal governments. State and local 
governments will use this federal relief to con-
tinue providing essential services to the Amer-
ican public. With this soon-to-be law, Con-
gress has answered President Biden’s call to 
defeat the COVID–19 pandemic, rebuild our 
economy, and help Americans return to nor-
mal life once we have widespread vaccination. 
While this soon-to-be law does not include 
my ‘‘Special Districts Provide Essential Serv-
ices Act’’ (H.R. 535), I hope that states will 
use the flexibility provided under the ‘‘Amer-
ican Rescue Plan Act’’ to pass though some 
federal relief to the 2,700 special districts in 
California and 30,000 special districts nation-
wide providing essential public services cities 
and counties do not provide to residents. 
Those services include first responders, polic-
ing, firefighting, public health, and more, mak-
ing special districts indeed critical to the com-
munities they serve. Special districts must now 
make their case directly to each state’s Gov-
ernor. 
I want to thank my colleagues who cospon-
sored H.R. 535 and U.S. Senator KYRSTEN 
SINEMA (D–AZ) for sponsoring the companion 
legislation. 
I plan to continue working to ensure that 
special districts can access the Federal Re-
serve’s Municipal Liquidity Facility in the fu-
ture, as called for in my ‘‘Special Districts Pro-
vide Essential Services Act.’’ Like states, 
counties, and cities, many special districts 
serve large populations and have the legal au-
thority to issue short-term tax and revenue an-
ticipation notes. However, special districts are 
not currently guaranteed access to the Munic-
ipal Liquidity Facility, even to offset revenue 
shortfalls caused by this ongoing pandemic or 
similar emergencies. 
Congress must ensure that local govern-
ments including special districts have the fed-
eral support needed to deliver crucial quality- 
of-life services to communities during this 
global pandemic and future national emer-
gencies. 
COMMEMORATING 56TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
pay honor to the legacy of our late colleague, 
and my dear friend, Congressman John Lewis. 
This year marks the 56th Anniversary of the 
Bloody Sunday March in Selma, Alabama, 
over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It is vital that 
we pay homage to Congressman Lewis and to 
the hundreds of individuals who marched be-
side him to protect the voices of the many, as 
well as to remember the history, legacy, and 
increasing importance of the infamous Bloody 
Sunday March. 
On March 7, 1965, about six-hundred 
peaceful protesters, including a 25-year-old 
John Lewis, were violently attacked by Ala-
bama State troopers while attempting to cross 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge to begin the peace-
ful march from Selma to Montgomery. The on-
going Civil Rights Movement led nonviolent 
demonstrators to the bridge that Sunday with 
the risk of being met with opposition from law 
enforcement—but the outcome was much 
worse. Protesters were tear-gassed, clubbed, 
spat on, whipped, trampled by horses, and ul-
timately degraded by the police. The abhorrent 
attacks, which were seen on television and in 
newspapers, shocked the nation. 
The events of that day mobilized Congress 
to pass the bipartisan Voting Rights Act of 
1965—outlawing discriminatory voting laws 
which silenced the voices of Black Americans. 
Fifty-six years later, we celebrate the ‘‘good 
trouble’’ Congressman Lewis created that 
Sunday, and the decades to follow, embarking 
our nation down a path toward a more perfect 
union. Bloody Sunday is a dark moment in our 
country’s history, but it should not be left in 
the past. The increasing importance of memo-
rializing that day draws on the impact it made 
on our citizens as well as our legislative body. 
This Congress should continue to implement 
the principles of our late colleague and uphold 
his legacy. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so privileged to join the 
Congressional Black Caucus in its First An-
nual John Lewis Special Order Hour. Please 
join me in commemorating his leadership and 
bravery on the Edmund Pettus Bridge fifty-six 
years ago. May he Rest in Power, a well- 
earned peace, and may his memory be a 
blessing to all of us who loved him.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN 
WILLIAMS’ 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 12, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize John Williams of Allen Park 
on the occasion of his 100th Birthday. His 
contributions to our community and to our na-
tion are worthy of commendation. 
Mr. Williams was born in Emporia, Kansas 
and moved to Detroit, Michigan as the eldest 
of nine children when he was only three years 
old. Growing up in Detroit he was an active 
athlete, playing both baseball and football. He 
proudly cast his very first vote on election day 
for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
As a young man, he volunteered to serve 
his country in the United States Navy. Sta-
tioned in the Pacific, he survived the attacks 
on Pearl Harbor on that infamous day, De-
cember 7, 1941. After the death of his first 
wife while she was pregnant with their third 
child in California, Mr. Williams returned to De-
troit with his two children. It was here where 
he later met his late wife Oila. Mr. Williams 
worked for Great Lakes Steel in Ecorse, Michi-
gan for nearly 35 years. 
A man of faith, Mr. Williams has served as 
a deacon at Whitlock Memorial Church of God 
in Christ in Detroit for over 63 years. These 
days, he continues to attend bible study and 
still makes time to attend church services. 
Friends and family know him as someone with 
a big smile, a love of people, and most impor-
tantly, someone who always has time to im-
part his wisdom or share a joke. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring John Williams on his 100th 
Birthday. He has honorably served this coun-
try through his service in the United States 
Navy during World War II. I join with Mr. Wil-
liams’ 
family, 
including 
his 
two 
grand-
daughters, four great grandchildren, many 
nieces and nephews, and friends in extending 
my best wishes to him on his birthday, in cele-
bration of another exemplary year of life.

considering the appeal. In addition, for re-
ceipt of any fine notification under H. Res. 
73, the Committee shall notify the Member 
of the Committee’s obligation to publish the 
fine notification. 
2. For a fine notification received under H. 
Res. 73, the Chair and Ranking Member will 
make the notification public within two 
business days of receipt. The Committee will 
provide the subject of the fine with notice of 
publication one business day prior to release. 
3. The Chair and Ranking Member may 
make redactions to the public fine notifica-
tion received under H. Res. 73 as they deem 
necessary to protect certain personally iden-
tifiable information or other sensitive de-
tails. 
4. In appealing a fine to the Committee, 
the appellant may be represented by counsel 
at their own expense. 
5. Upon receipt of an appeal of a fine, the 
Committee will send a letter confirming its 
receipt of the appeal and notifying the appel-
lant that it will consider the appeal within 
30 calendar days. Also, upon receipt of an ap-
peal, the Committee will send a letter to the 
Sergeant at Arms, U.S. Capitol Police, and/ 
or Chief Administrative Officer requesting 
that they provide the Committee with a copy 
of all records of any reviews, determinations, 
or decisions regarding the alleged viola-
tion(s) and any additional information, in-
cluding video recordings of the alleged viola-
tion(s). 
6. If the written appeal does not provide 
sufficient information to fully assess an ap-
peal, the Chair and Ranking Member may 
jointly authorize staff to request additional 
information from the appellant. 
7. If an appellant asserts there are factual 
errors with the findings and any supporting 
documentation, the Chair and Ranking Mem-

geant at Arms and the U.S. Capitol Police. 
The Chair and Ranking Member may also 
jointly seek additional information from 
other sources. 
8. The Chair or Ranking Member, con-
sistent with Committee Rule 5(b), may place 
consideration of an appeal on the agenda at

scheduled to occur within 30 days of receipt 
of an appeal, the Chair will make reasonable 
efforts to convene a meeting during that 
time period. 
9. Members of the Committee will be pro-
vided any information needed for consider-
ation of the appeal not later than three days 
prior to any meeting in which the appeal will 
be considered, whenever possible. 
10. The Committee may agree to an appeal 
if it determines the fine is (a) arbitrary and 
capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other-
wise not consistent with law or with prin-
ciples of fairness; (b) not made consistent 
with required procedures; or (c) unsupported 
by substantial evidence. 
11. The Chair and Ranking Member will no-
tify the Speaker, the Sergeant at Arms, 
Chief Administrative Officer, and the public 
of the determination regarding a fine appeal 
(or that no appeal has been filed) two busi-
ness days after such determination (or the 
expiration of the appeal period), and will 
also publish the written appeal if the appel-
lant so chooses. The Committee will provide 
the subject of the fine with notice of publica-
tion one business day prior to release.

NATIONAL 
POLLUTANT 
DIS-
CHARGE 
ELIMINATION 
SYSTEM 
(NPDES) 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 12, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
reintroduce a noncontroversial amendment to 
the Clean Water Act, extending permit terms 
for publicly owned water infrastructure projects 
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimi-
nation System (NPDES). I thank my colleague 
Congressman KEN CALVERT (R–CA) for his 
support as the original cosponsor. 
This bipartisan bill would simply extend the 
NPDES permit term for projects owned by 
local public agencies and water districts from 
the current 5 up to 10 years. This would en-
courage investment in modern wastewater 
treatment facilities by relieving unnecessary, 
bureaucratic paperwork and allow regulators 
to focus on watershed-scale planning and 
water quality standards. This bill is supported 
by the National Association of Clean Water 
Agencies, National Association of Counties, 
United States Conference of Mayors, National 
Association of Counties, National League of 
Cities, National Water Resources Association, 
Association of California Water Agencies, Cali-
fornia Association of Sanitation Agencies, 
WateReuse Association, and Water Environ-
ment Federation. 
The United States has fallen behind many 
other developed nations in wastewater infra-
structure, receiving a D+ grade in the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers’ most recent 
report card. One reason for this lapse in infra-
structure improvements is arbitrary permitting 
timetables imposed by the federal govern-
ment. Permit terms should match the con-
struction timelines and on-the-ground reality 
for the projects to which they apply. This is 
currently not the case. With over 95 percent of 
wastewater infrastructure spending at the local 
level, according to the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors, lengthening permit terms for local 
governments would be one of the most expe-
ditious ways to encouraging further investment 
in 21st-century wastewater treatment facilities. 
Current NPDES permitting under the Clean 
Water Act has a maximum term of 5 years, an 
aggressive timeline that is impracticable given 
construction schedules of local public agen-
cies. As a result, California’s State Water Re-
sources Control Board and Clean Water Act 
regulators in other states are overwhelmed 
with a backlog of NPDES permitting requests 
for existing projects. New public projects are, 
likewise, significantly delayed by this unneces-
sary bureaucracy. 
My office has identified nearly a dozen 
major public projects to modernize wastewater 
treatment plants or build water recycling facili-
ties in California delayed by the current 5-year 
NPDES term. One such public water recycling 
project in a drought-stricken region of southern 
California is well into its third NPDES permit 
term before even breaking ground on the un-
derlying project. This is just one example 
where the arbitrary 5-year permit term im-
pedes public water infrastructure projects that 
would advance the stated goals of the Clean 
Water Act. 
My bill would alleviate this burden by ex-
tending the maximum permit to 10 years, help-
ing local water agencies nationwide better im-
plement the Clean Water Act and literally cut-
ting the permitting backlog in half. Extending 
the NPDES permitting term is a practical solu-
tion that allows local agencies to meet the ex-
isting regulatory standards while building pub-
lic water projects that measurably improve 
water quality, which after all is the purpose of 
the Clean Water Act. NPDES permit terms for 
private projects or industrial discharges would 
remain at the current 5-year term. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members 
to cosponsor this bipartisan bill to extend the 
maximum NPDES permit term for public water 
projects under the Clean Water Act. I plan to 
make this commonsense legislation a top pri-
ority in my work on the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure.
