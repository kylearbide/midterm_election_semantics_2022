Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, 2020 
No. 215 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the 
order of the House of January 7, 2020, 
the Chair will now recognize Members 
from lists submitted by the majority 
and minority leaders for morning-hour 
debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m.

TRIBUTE TO FRONTLINE WORKERS 
DURING CORONAVIRUS 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. 
HARTZLER) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the long-term care 
and nursing home workers of Mis-
souri’s Fourth District, who have wit-
nessed the devastating effects of the 
coronavirus pandemic on a daily basis. 
These frontline healthcare workers 
cope with the deaths and illnesses 
brought on by this virus and are wit-
nesses to the heartbreaking losses fam-
ily members experience whose loved 
ones pass away without benefit of that 
final embrace before saying good-bye. 
For these noble and selfless individ-
uals, the impact of COVID–19 isn’t re-
stricted to emotional wounds opened 
through witnessing the suffering of 
others, but by the personal physical 
health risks posed by being on the 
front lines to conduct their day-to-day 
activities. 
These frontline workers in our nurs-
ing homes and long-term care facilities 
are heroes who have chosen to possibly 
put themselves in peril by answering 
the call. They have been a source of en-
couragement, hope, and help to our Na-
tion’s greatest generation, a lifeline 
amidst a challenging time. 
On behalf of myself and the caring 
families of Missouri’s Fourth District, 
thank you. We appreciate you, and we 
pray God blesses you in a very special 
way during this special season and 
throughout the year. 
f 
WHAT MESSAGE ARE WE 
SENDING? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TAKANO). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MCGOVERN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, as the 
co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human 
Rights Commission, as chairman of the 
Congressional-Executive 
Commission 
on China, as someone who cares deeply 
about human rights and democratic 
principles, and as a proud Member of 
this House, I rise to express my deep 
concern about the damage being done 
to America’s moral authority by those 
who refuse to accept the legitimate 
outcome of November’s election and 
who continue to deliberately spread 
lies and manufacture conspiracy theo-
ries that have no basis of fact in an at-
tempt to overturn the will of the 
American people. 
As Americans, we see ourselves as a 
beacon to the world, as that shining 
city upon the hill. We believe our polit-
ical experiment, to create a country 
united by ideals, rather than blood and 
soil, is unique and exceptional. 
We promote democracy as a pillar of 
our foreign policy, confident in our 
own example. We say we are a nation of 
laws, not men. 
Yet, since November 3, a widespread 
effort to overturn the results of the 
presidential election have been openly 
endorsed by some high-ranking leaders 
and facilitated by the silence of many 
more. 
For 
the 
record, 
Joe 
Biden 
and 
KAMALA HARRIS won by more than 7 
million votes. They received 81 million 
votes, 51.3 percent of the total cast. On 
Monday, President-elect Biden won 306 
electoral college votes, two more than 
President Trump in 2016. 
There is no question that Joe Biden 
and KAMALA HARRIS won the election 
resoundingly. Those who believe other-
wise first alleged massive fraud, then 
claimed election procedures were un-
fair. But when granted the opportunity 
in courts of law to present evidence of 
fraud, they couldn’t do it. 
There simply is no proof of fraud at 
any significant scale. The attacks 
against 
voting 
by 
mail, 
signature 
matching, and the like, notably selec-
tive to begin with, had mostly already 
been litigated. 
Mr. Speaker, it is critically impor-
tant that Americans trust our elec-
tions. That is why credible claims of 
fraud or irregularities must be inves-
tigated and corrective action taken. 
That has happened. 
There have been multiple recounts. 
Three in Georgia alone. Those seeking 
to overturn the election results have 
lost 59 times in courts across seven 
States and twice before this Supreme 
Court. 
At least 86 judges, many appointed 
by Republicans, have rejected at least 
one post-election lawsuit. All three Su-
preme Court Justices nominated by 
President Trump ruled against him. 
Mr. Speaker, the fact is that the No-
vember elections were free and fair. 
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency said that the election 
‘‘was the most secure in American his-
tory’’ and ‘‘there is no evidence that 
any voting system deleted or lost 
votes, changed votes, or was in any 
way compromised.’’ 
Attorney General Barr, of all people, 
said that the Justice Department has 
uncovered no voting fraud ‘‘on a scale 
that could have affected a different

outcome in the election.’’ I am using 
his words. 
The election is over, yet President 
Trump still refuses to concede and his 
allies continue to look for ways to 
throw out the votes of millions of 
Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, this is crazy. It is un- 
democratic and un-American, and it 
degrades democracy in every corner of 
the world. If this were happening in an-
other country, our government would 
rightfully demand that the results of 
free and fair elections be respected. 
Mr. Speaker, some may criticize my 
remarks today because I objected to 
certifying the electoral college results 
in 2017. So let me be clear. I do not op-
pose using established constitutional 
procedures. I object when those proce-
dures are not used to further the truth 
or to undermine it. 
In 2017, eight U.S. intelligence agen-
cies—eight—said that Russia had en-
gaged in an unprecedented attempt to 
interfere in our elections in favor of 
Donald Trump. I sought the kind of as-
surance about the security of the 2016 
election that has already been provided 
for 2020. It was not forthcoming. 
Mr. Speaker, America’s institutions 
will survive the test of the last few 
weeks. Due to the quiet courage and 
commitment of thousands of volunteer 
election workers, local and State elec-
tion officials—some facing threats and 
intimidation—and the integrity of our 
courts, the clear choice of the people 
will be respected. But I worry that we 
are becoming what we condemn else-
where. 
Democracy is not guaranteed. Each 
of us has to choose democracy every 
day in the way we conduct our politics. 
Either we choose to enforce democratic 
rules of the game or we don’t. Either 
we choose to accept the losses along-
side the wins or we don’t. Either we 
choose to tell the truth or we don’t. 
Mr. Speaker, today I urge my col-
leagues to proceed with caution. If our 
politics belie our values, we will be lost 
at home and ignored abroad. 
I believe we are an exceptional coun-
try. Let’s act like it. 
f 
HOLIDAYS FOR HEROES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind us 
all of the great American Red Cross 
program, Holidays for Heroes, an op-
portunity to thank and support our 
military, veterans, and their families 
throughout this holiday season. 
We all look forward to gathering 
with family and friends and loved ones 
this time of year. For our servicemem-
bers, that is a luxury that all too often 
is not able to happen. 
These men and women spend many 
months at a time—at times over a year 
and, in their service, years—away from 
their families. That is difficult no mat-
ter what time of year it is, but it is 
around the holidays their sacrifice is 
magnified. 
I would like to encourage everyone to 
reach out to their local Red Cross 
chapters to find out how to send a card, 
how to volunteer or get involved how-
ever they see fit to spread some holi-
day cheer to our heroes. Even a small 
gesture can brighten the holiday sea-
son for those that are deployed; a re-
minder that they are remembered, that 
they are appreciated every day, espe-
cially during this holiday season. 
So take a moment out of your day 
today to let a soldier know just how 
much you appreciate them. 
f 
RESTAURANTS NEED A LIFELINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TONKO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, millions of 
America’s restaurants are on the edge 
of financial collapse. If we do not get 
them a lifeline now, we will lose these 
pillars of community and economic vi-
tality that have long stood throughout 
our Nation. And we will pay an even 
steeper price as millions more Ameri-
cans lose their jobs and families are 
left stranded with nowhere to turn. 
More than 110,000 of America’s res-
taurants have already closed during 
this 
very 
difficult 
pandemic. 
Res-
taurateurs have adapted, have re-
invented, have dug deep to hold on this 
long. But more than one-third say they 
won’t survive the next 6 months with-
out Federal help. In my home State of 
New York, that figure is closer to more 
than one-half. 
We can and we must act to save these 
cherished Main Street establishments 
before it is too late. The House already 
passed a bipartisan bill that gets the 
job done. With more than 200 bipar-
tisan cosponsors, H.R. 7197, the RES-
TAURANTS Act, would create a $120 
billion revitalization fund that would 
rescue 
America’s 
independent 
res-
taurants. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in 
the Senate to join us in this bipartisan 
effort and pass the RESTAURANTS 
Act. Our Main Street businesses have 
always delivered for us. Let us make 
sure that we deliver for them now, 
when they need it so desperately. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE EXEMPLARY 
SERVICE OF MAIA HUNT ESTES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. BROWN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speak-
er, I want to recognize the exemplary 
service of my now former chief of staff, 
Maia Hunt Estes. 
Maia has been an indispensable ad-
viser and confidante to me for more 
than a decade, including my first days 
in Congress and during my tenure as 
Maryland’s Lieutenant Governor. It is 
fair to say that I wouldn’t be here 
today without her extraordinary coun-
sel. 
I could count on Maia day and night 
to get the job done. Maia brought an 
unmatched level of commitment to 
every issue, every challenge, every sin-
gle fight, every constituent case, no 
matter how big or small. 
Throughout our time together, Maia 
has 
provided 
strategic 
advice 
and 
clear-eyed leadership on national secu-
rity and defense, transportation and in-
frastructure. 
Maia served as my key liaison to the 
Congressional Black Caucus and Demo-
cratic leadership on core issues to me 
and the people of Maryland. Her deep 
understanding of the issues, candid ad-
vice, insightful opinions, and pas-
sionate drive for serving others has 
helped me deliver for my State, my 
constituents, our servicemembers, and 
our country. 
Maia served as a mentor for my 
team, both in my district office and on 
Capitol Hill. She led my staff to always 
put the needs of our constituents first 
and work hard to enact real change. 
I look forward to seeing the great 
work that Maia will do as she takes on 
new challenges and, no doubt, excels. 
Maia, thank you very much for your 
years of service. You have made a dif-
ference in the lives of many, and I 
know you will continue to do so in the 
years ahead.

SUPPORTING THE JOHN LEWIS 
TOD LOOP 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to draw the Chamber’s attention to 
legislation I introduced yesterday. I 
was honored to introduce legislation 
which would initiate the process to 
bring innovative mass transit options 
to the south side. 
It was an important first step to 
bringing the economic power of tran-
sit-oriented development to often ne-
glected areas within the metro Atlanta 
region without displacement of long-
time residents, the John Lewis TOD 
Loop. The report will be required to be 
produced to the Congress within 1 year. 
In addition to the study, this legisla-
tion launches the first transformative 
transit project. This project will spark 
improvement and bring economic jus-
tice to established neighborhoods and 
businesses in the areas where Rep-
resentative John Lewis lived for dec-
ades. 
Innovative mass transit options in 
the corridor will link Oakland City and 
Fort McPherson to Greenbriar Mall 
and a future senior citizen-focused 
transit and mixed-use center named in 
honor of Representative John Lewis. 
Such forward progress will improve 
the lives of residents while reducing 
our CO2 emissions, helping to heal a 
warming planet. 
This project is yet another step to-
ward revitalizing parts of Atlanta yet

to realize their full potential. Once the 
overall program is established, it has 
the potential to spur $5 billion in eco-
nomic development across thousands of 
acres in low- to middle-income commu-
nities. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Congress to pass 
this legislation, launch this study, and 
bring this transit corridor one step 
closer to reality. 
CELEBRATING THE LIVES OF FOUR GREAT 
GEORGIANS 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to cel-
ebrate the lives of four great Georgians 
important to Georgia’s Fifth Congres-
sional District and to greater metro 
Atlanta who have recently passed 
away. 
Mrs. Celestine Bray Bottoms was a 
pillar of the greater Atlanta commu-
nity. As a longtime educator with the 
Atlanta Public Schools system, Mrs. 
Bottoms touched the lives of thousands 
of students, parents, and fellow edu-
cators throughout Atlanta. 
Celestine Bray Bottoms was a grad-
uate of Atlanta’s illustrious HBCU 
Spelman College, was the mother of 
Derrick 
and 
Darian 
Bottoms, 
the 
mother-in-law 
to 
Atlanta 
Mayor 
Keisha 
Lance 
Bottoms, 
a 
beloved 
grandmother, a community activist, 
and a friend to many. 
Today, District Five honors the life 
of Mrs. Celestine Bray Bottoms. 
Mr. Speaker, Joseph Arrington, Sr., 
was a third-generation native of At-
lanta, a graduate of the historic Book-
er T. Washington High School, and a 
graduate of Atlanta’s Morehouse Col-
lege. 
Attorney Arrington obtained his law 
degree from North Carolina Central 
University and a master’s degree in 
public health from the University of 
Pittsburgh. 
A member of Kappa Alpha Psi frater-
nity and president of Morehouse Col-
lege National Alumni Association, Jo-
seph Arrington, Sr., will forever be re-
membered as a man of honor. 
Mr. Speaker, Dr. Jane Smith was a 
beloved third-generation Atlantan. She 
attended Charles Harper High School 
in Atlanta, Georgia, where she held the 
distinction as the school’s very first 
homecoming queen. 
Dr. Smith’s commitment to bettering 
the lives of fellow Atlantans was un-
matched. 
Dr. Jane Smith and the Smith and 
Browning families are some of the 
original native families that have 
strengthened and elevated Black com-
munities in greater metro Atlanta and 
beyond. 
An unmatched beauty on the inside 
and out, Dr. Smith will never be for-
gotten. 
Mr. Speaker, last and certainly not 
least, 
we 
remember 
Dilcie 
Sledge 
Ragsdale, who passed away 1 week ago 
today. 
Ms. Dilcie hailed from Chattanooga, 
Tennessee, and was a graduate of 
Spelman and Atlanta University. 
As a lifelong educator, she dedicated 
her life to teaching and enriching the 
lives of others. She lived a full life. She 
was a gardener, an enthusiastic cook, 
and a proud member of Delta Sigma 
Theta Sorority, Incorporated. 
She is survived by her children, Val-
erie and Renard. 
I know I speak for the Fifth District 
of Georgia when I say she will be dear-
ly missed. 
May the memories of all these de-
parted souls be a blessing.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

The recess having expired, the House

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord of all creation, thank You for 
giving us another day. 
The coronavirus continues to threat-
en the lives and health of our American 
people, and jeopardize the health and 
well-being 
of 
healthcare 
providers 
every day. The healthcare community 
rushes to vaccinate, and scientists 
strive still to provide solutions to this 
plague. Bless us all, O Lord, have 
mercy. 
Continue to strengthen the resolve of 
legislators here in the Capitol in their 
efforts to provide an economic relief 
bill and funding the government into 
the next administration. May their 
better angels prevail over the political 
tensions that have been so powerful 
during this difficult year. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. OLSON led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to five requests

f 
HONORING ROSE OCHI 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of a dear men-
tor, an honorable public servant, and a 
stalwart leader in the Japanese-Amer-
ican community, Rose Ochi. 
Rose was one of my mentors when I 
was in my twenties and thirties. Her 
guidance and her wisdom helped me 
during those formative years. I know 
that I was not the only person whose 
life she touched. She blazed a trail for 
many others in our community besides 
me. 
Rose was a justice seeker and served 
as an Associate Attorney General of 
the United States under President 
Clinton, as the criminal justice plan-
ning director for Mayor Tom Bradley, 
and as a fighter for redress for the Jap-
anese-American community who suf-
fered through internment. Her work 
contributed to making America a more 
perfect Union. 
Madam Speaker, we will miss Rose’s 
towering presence and grace, but her 
legacy will live on. 
f 
DON’T MESS WITH TEXAS–22 
VOLLEYBALL TEAMS 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to do something Texans love to 
do: to brag about my home State. I am 
going to brag about two Texas-22 
volleyball teams that made the Texas 
finals this past weekend. 
The Fulshear Chargers have played 4 
short years of high school volleyball. It 
took them only 3 years to win the 
State title in class 4–A. That was last 
year. This year, they moved up to class 
5–A. A downgrade? No. They went to 
the 
5–A 
State 
finals, 
losing 
to 
undefeated Lovejoy. 
In 6–A, the Seven Lakes Spartans 
were amazing. Despite having half the 
team down with COVID and not being 
able to practice for 21⁄2 weeks, they won 
the 6–A championship, the first team 
ever in the 101-year history of the Katy 
Independent School District to win the 
State title. 
Madam Speaker, 1 million neighbors 
in Texas-22 and Santa Clause congratu-
late and are darn proud of our Spartans 
and our Chargers. They have proved 
once and for all: Don’t mess with 
Texas-22 volleyball teams. 
Ho, ho, ho.

December 18, 2020 
HONORING THE LIFE OF TAYLOR 
DEROSA 
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of 
my young constituent, Taylor DeRosa. 
Taylor made her mark as a student 
activist at Royal Oak High School. She 
was beginning her college career at 
Grand Valley State University when 
her life was taken so tragically several 
days ago. 
I met Taylor when I was running for 
Congress in 2018 and she was launching 
a Students Demand Action chapter. 
Taylor immediately struck me as a 
huge flash of sunshine in an unjust 
world. Her commitment to justice was 
frank and undeniable. You knew the 
world would change at least a little be-
cause Taylor was present, fighting for 
sensible gun reform, fighting for every-
one to see and cherish Black lives, and 
fighting to empower women and girls. 
Taylor made me feel that every 
minute we invest in our young people 
is time well-spent. I feel that now, even 
as we struggle to cope with her loss, 
because she inspired me and so many 
folks young and old all around her. 
My heart goes out to Taylor’s de-
voted mother, Cara, and all who knew 
and loved her in this time of heart-
break and mourning. 
f 
CONGRATULATING DR. GLENN 
DEIBERT 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Dr. Glenn Deibert, who will be retiring 
as Coastal Pines Technical College’s 
president at the end of February. 
Dr. Deibert has served 27 years in 
higher education and has served four of 
Georgia’s technical colleges, including 
Okefenokee Technical College, Coastal 
Pines Technical College, Southwest 
Georgia Technical College, and South-
ern Technical College, formerly known 
as Swainsboro Technical College. 
Because of his dedication to improv-
ing education and the lives of students, 
he was recently named one of the Top 
100 Most Influential Georgians by Geor-
gia Trend’s yearly publication. This 
title recognizes some of the most pres-
tigious folks who have contributed 
greatly to the State’s success. 
Dr. Deibert attended Central High 
School in Thomasville, Georgia, and 
graduated from Thomas Area Tech-
nical 
School, 
which 
later 
became 
Southwest Georgia Technical College, 
so his appreciation for technical col-
leges is personal. 
Dr. Deibert’s work to improve Coast-
al Pines contributed to record enroll-
ment at the college for multiple years. 
Madam Speaker, I wish him and his 
family the best of luck as he begins his 
retirement, and I am thankful for his 
many years of dedication to improving 
higher education in Georgia’s First 
Congressional District. 
f 
SUPPORTING EVICTION RELIEF IN 
COVID PACKAGE 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support today of eviction relief, 
which we expect to see included in the 
COVID package we vote on soon. 
While we need to do more, this bill 
provides a meaningful start to address-
ing the eviction crisis caused by the 
pandemic. In Pennsylvania alone, near-
ly one-quarter million households are 
behind on their rent and facing the real 
threat of eviction. 
This bill will allow, as an authorized 
administrative expense, funds to be 
sent to civil legal aid organizations to 
help keep people in their homes. Under 
this crucial legislation, legal aid orga-
nizations, including faith-based groups, 
can represent tenants in eviction cases, 
improve access to utilities, and ensure 
housing 
conditions 
meet 
necessary 
standards. 
Rental assistance alone will not help 
the thousands of people facing eviction; 
families often need access to legal ad-
vice to protect their rights. Legal 
counsel should not be a privilege saved 
for the wealthiest in our country. It is 
a basic necessity for navigating the dif-
ficult problems facing Americans who 
are on the bottom rungs of our econ-
omy. 
I will continue advocating for the 
families hardest hit by the COVID pan-
demic, and I thank my colleagues for 
their hard work on this legislation. 
f 
ROCKBRIDGE CHRISTMAS 
BASKETS 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Rockbridge 
Christmas Baskets program. 
Originally founded as the Santa 
Clause Truck, the Rockbridge Christ-
mas Baskets program has been a bless-
ing to the Shenandoah Valley since 
1948. 
This tremendous, all-volunteer orga-
nization assembles and delivers thou-
sands of food and toy care packages to 
struggling families each year. 
While the coronavirus may have put 
a damper on the holiday season for 
some, it was no match for the gen-
erosity and spirit of the folks at the 
Rockbridge Christmas Baskets pro-
gram. Moving their packing day to a 
larger facility and spreading it out 
over packing week to ensure the health 
of those involved, the organization will 
donate a record 68,000 pounds of food 
and 1,300 toys to families throughout 
Lexington, 
Rockbridge, 
and 
Buena 
Vista this year. 
Having worked side by side with this 
incredible group many times, along 
with my family, I can tell you it is the 
overwhelming community effort that 
makes it such a success—plus the 
doughnut holes they serve. 
Folks 
coming 
together 
from 
all 
walks of life to help their neighbors in 
need truly embodies the spirit of the 
holiday 
season, 
and 
I 
thank 
the 
Rockbridge Christmas Baskets pro-
gram for their continued efforts to 
bring cheer to so many in our area.

December 18, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
RODNEY
DAVIS) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on S. 3418. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 3418, the Safeguarding Tomorrow 
through Ongoing Risk Mitigation Act, 
or STORM Act. 
This bipartisan and bicameral bill in-
troduced in the Senate by Senators 
GARY PETERS and RON JOHNSON, and in 
the House by Representatives ANGIE 
CRAIG, 
RODNEY
DAVIS, 
and 
RICK 
CRAWFORD, would amend the Stafford 
Act to provide another opening for 
local governments to fund mitigation 
and resilience projects. 
Modeled after the highly successful 
Drinking Water and Clean Water State 
Revolving Funds managed by the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency, this bill 
would allow States and Tribal govern-
ments 
to 
apply 
for 
capitalization 
grants to establish revolving funds 
that would then be used to fund a vari-
ety of infrastructure projects. 
b 1215 
The Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure under both Demo-
cratic and Republican majorities has 
examined the rising cost of disasters 
and reforms necessary to address them. 
Time and again, we have arrived at 
the similar conclusion: Investments in 
mitigation have a quantifiable and sig-
nificant return on investment in reduc-
ing disaster response and recovery 
costs. 
The current sources of Federal fund-
ing available for pre-disaster mitiga-
tion are highly competitive and ex-
tremely limited due to the backlog of 
worthwhile projects identified across 
the Nation. 
The State revolving loan funds will 
be established by this litigation and 
would allow States to offer low-inter-
est loans to cities and counties for 
projects to mitigate a wide variety of 
hazards. 
Since 2000, there have only been 3 
years during which we have seen fewer 
than 100 Presidentially declared events 
under the Stafford Act, and there is no 
indication that the frequency or sever-
ity of these disasters is on the decline. 
The record-setting year we just en-
dured points to the contrary. 
Madam Speaker, while future disas-
ters will inevitably cause large-scale 
damage and require costly recoveries, 
by providing new opportunities for in-
vestments in pre-disaster mitigation, 
this bill encourages resilience at the 
community level and will contribute to 
a considerable reduction in the cost of 
future recoveries. 
Madam Speaker, I support S. 3418, 
and urge my colleagues to do the same, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, thank you to the 
chair of the Highways and Transit Sub-
committee, Ms. Holmes Norton, for her 
support for this bill. 
I also really thank my good friend 
and colleague from the great State of 
Minnesota, 
Congresswoman 
ANGIE 
CRAIG, with whom I was happy and 
proud to be the colead of H.R. 3779, the 
Resilience Revolving Loan Fund Act of 
2019. This is the House companion bill 
to the bill that we are now debating, S. 
3418, the STORM Act. I thank Con-
gresswoman CRAIG for her leadership 
on this legislation and for allowing me 
to be the colead on this bill with her 
that ensures that much-needed support 
is available to our rural communities. 
This bill will prevent catastrophes 
across the country before disaster 
strikes, saving lives, livelihoods, and 
heartache for many Americans. 
Madam Speaker, imagine this: Com-
munities that are prone to consistent 
disasters on an annual basis can now 
have a pot of money to make their 
community safer before disasters hit, 
thus, investing on the front end to save 
taxpayer dollars on the back end. This 
bill is going to establish that revolving 
loan fund to support these important 
disaster mitigation efforts, and in most 
areas in my district, that usually 
means my rural communities. 
Upfront investment, as I just men-
tioned, in mitigation has been proven 
to reduce disaster costs and save lives, 
and that is why this bill is so impor-
tant. 
While Congress has worked in the 
past to increase support for mitigation, 
many local projects still go unfunded. 
Unfortunately, localized disasters that 
hit communities like those in my dis-
trict, while devastating, may never re-
ceive a major disaster declaration. We 
have passed reforms to address this 
issue, including my bill, the Disaster 
Declaration 
Improvement 
Act, 
but 
more reforms are obviously needed. 
S. 3418 will provide these commu-
nities more options in mitigating the 
impact of disasters that have left so 
many communities without relief. And 
with the flexibilities built into the bill, 
this bill will ensure key projects will 
be eligible for these loans. 
I also take this opportunity to thank 
one of my constituents for his advo-
cacy on this bill, and that is Mayor 
Rick Eberlin of Grafton, Illinois. Graf-
ton, Illinois—the Key West to the Mis-
sissippi, I like to call it—is a prime ex-
ample of a community that would ben-
efit greatly from this piece of legisla-
tion. 
Mayor Eberlin has tirelessly fought 
for the people of Grafton and was the 
individual who brought this partner-
ship and this legislation to my atten-
tion. I have no doubt that the funds 
made available under this bill will en-
sure Grafton and its surrounding com-
munities are better protected during 
the next flood season. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
the 
Virgin 
Islands 
(Ms. 
PLASKETT), my friend. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleagues, and while I am 
happy to support measures to improve 
resiliency in the Committee on Trans-
portation and Infrastructure, a com-
mittee on which I serve, I am dis-
appointed that this bill is not inclusive 
of U.S. territories other than Puerto 
Rico in the normal operation of this 
new resiliency program. 
Under the Stafford Act, the Virgin Is-
lands and all other U.S. territories and 
the District of Columbia are defined 
and treated as States. This legislative 
amendment to the Stafford Act should 
be no different. That is why the House 
version of this bill was amended in 
committee, so that this new program is 
equally inclusive of all jurisdictions 
that are already treated as States by 
the Stafford Act. That was not what 
was approved by the committee but 
passed by this House in H.R. 2, the 
Moving Forward Act. 
Madam Speaker, the Virgin Islands 
and the other smaller territories have 
been devastated by unprecedented nat-
ural disasters in recent years. All of 
these American jurisdictions have tre-
mendous need for hazard mitigation 
projects that reduce risks for home-
owners, businesses, nonprofits, the cost 
of insurance claims, and Federal relief 
payments from extreme weather-re-
lated disasters. 
I believe it is unfair to have a pro-
gram that first makes grants to Indian 
Tribes, Puerto Rico, and the District of 
Columbia to improve resiliency, and 
then tells the four remaining smaller 
jurisdictions, defined as States already, 
that they get to have what amounts to 
pennies maybe left over from the 2 per-
cent set aside of funding that first is 
going to be spent on administrative 
costs and technical assistance to give 
the resiliency program to everyone 
else. 
Madam Speaker, as a practical mat-
ter, of course, that will amount to 
nothing left for the people of my dis-
trict, American Samoa, Guam, the 
Northern Marianas, and the smaller 
territories. 
Madam Speaker, I understand and 
have been told that the committee is 
willing to work and try to find a tech-
nical fix to this both in the House and 
the Senate. I urge that that occurs. 
While I support this measure, once 
again, you cannot continue to forget 
the smaller territories.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7268 
December 18, 2020 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I do say, first off, I 
truly appreciate the words and the pas-
sion from my good friend from the U.S. 
Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT). I am 
disappointed to see that this bill came 
back from the Senate without the pro-
visions that we supported on her behalf 
in the committee. 
Madam Speaker, I, too, would like to 
echo to the Senate and to the House as 
we move into the future: Let’s address 
this concern. There is bipartisan sup-
port for what Ms. PLASKETT is asking 
for. 
These are the types of bipartisan 
issues that we usually try and solve in 
the House, but, unfortunately, we got 
this from the Senate. We will let them 
be the ones to admit they screwed this 
up with a technical error. 
But let’s fix it. That is the key. Let’s 
work together to make that happen. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, S. 3418 
will help support critical mitigation 
projects in local communities, includ-
ing rural communities that are hit and 
devastated by these natural disasters. 
This will save lives and prevent dam-
age and loss to farmers, businesses, and 
homeowners across the country, and it 
is also going to save, long term, bil-
lions upon billions of taxpayer dollars 
that are going, time and time again, to 
help communities recover from events 
we know are going to happen. 
Let’s do something on the front end 
and save taxpayer dollars for the next 
generation on the back end. 
Madam Speaker, I would be remiss if 
I didn’t thank the staff on both sides of 
the aisle for their work to get this bill 
to a good place and with the Senate: on 
the majority side, Aaron Davis; on our 
own side, Johanna Hardy; and in my of-
fice, Jimmy Ballard. I really appre-
ciate all these folks and what they 
have done to help districts like mine. 
I also thank some folks who really 
worked hard on this bill, too, that are 
with me here today from the com-
mittee: Corey Cooke and her number 
one fan, her puppy, Coda Cooke; and 
also Tara Hupman and her number one 
fan, her puppy, Chester Hupman. I cer-
tainly hope my number one fans, when 
I get home, Rider and Julia Davis, one 
day get a chance to meet theirs. 
But it takes people working together 
to get things done, and these are the 
types of issues that show our success in 
this institution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, first of all, I appre-
ciate the words of my colleague on the 
other side of the aisle with respect to 
Ms. PLASKETT’s notion. I don’t know 
why the notion of pennywise and pound 
foolish—if that is the reason why this 
bipartisan bill that was sent to the 
Senate was sent back to us absent 
some Americans. I understand they 
will be working to try to fix this, but 
we don’t fix it when we allow disasters 
to move forward in the part of our 
country where disasters are more like-
ly to affect. They are not most likely 
to take effect in places like the Dis-
trict of Columbia where we just had a 
snowstorm and hardly a little bit of 
snow. They are far more likely to take 
effect in Ms. PLASKETT’s district in the 
Virgin Islands. 
Madam Speaker, I pledge with my 
good friend on the other side, with 
whom I have worked closely in the 
past, to do everything I can to make 
sure that all of us, including all of our 
territories, not only Puerto Rico, are 
included in this bill, as the House in-
tended. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, not-
withstanding the issues that both sides 
here in the House have with it, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of S. 3418, the Safeguarding 
Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation Act 
or the STORM Act, as amended. 
I want to thank Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee Chairman PETER DEFA-
ZIO, Subcommittee on Economic Development, 
Public Buildings, and Emergency Management 
Chair DINA TITUS and Ranking Members SAM 
GRAVES and JOHN KATKO for their work on this 
bill to get us to where we are today. 
I also want to thank fellow T&I Member 
RODNEY DAVIS for being a strong partner with 
me on this from the outset. I am also grateful 
to Majority Leader HOYER for scheduling a 
vote on this bill. 
Finally, I also want to thank the diligent 
members of the Committee’s staff, particularly 
Aaron Davis, for helping us reach this historic 
milestone. I also want to thank a former mem-
ber of my staff, Natalie Martinez, for helping to 
lead the introduction of this bill and my Legis-
lative Director Will Mitchell for helping to bring 
the bill across the finish line. 
Madam Speaker, by way of background, the 
original version of the STORM Act was intro-
duced last July as H.R.3779, the Resilience 
Revolving Loan Fund Act of 2019 following a 
catastrophic spring where Minnesota experi-
enced one of the most devastating flood sea-
sons on record. 
In response, I worked closely with local 
mayors in Minnesota dealing with the after-
math of this flooding to develop the concept of 
a resilience fund and establish a low-interest 
loan program for states to fund pre-disaster 
mitigation projects which greatly reduce the 
risks and costs of natural disasters. Revolving 
fund loans will be available for projects that 
minimize the risks of wildfires, earthquakes, 
floods, storm surges, tornadoes, and other 
events deemed catastrophic by FEMA. 
The revolving fund concept is modeled after 
similar state revolving funds authorized and 
funded by Congress for projects that have re-
sulted in a significant increase in the capacity 
and capabilities of water infrastructure in com-
munities across the nation. 
It is our hope that our colleagues on the Ap-
propriations Committee will see the wisdom in 
the revolving fund concept and fully capitalize 
this program starting in Fiscal Years 2022 and 
2023 so that disaster mitigation can see that 
same significant return on investment. 
Madam Speaker, another benefit of this bill 
is that it opens up mitigation funds to a new 
set of eligible folks. Currently, most FEMA 
hazard mitigation programs restrict Public As-
sistance mitigation funds if projects may ac-
crue to the benefit of homeowners and busi-
nesses—which can create challenges, particu-
larly in rural areas of my Congressional Dis-
trict with lower populations and large areas of 
farmland. The revolving loan fund before us 
today is specifically intended to reduce risks 
for homeowners, businesses, nonprofit organi-
zations and communities. 
As a matter of process, Madam Speaker, 
I’m pleased that our bill, like the STORM Act, 
moved through regular order on the Com-
mittee and attracted bipartisan, unanimous 
support when it passed the House. Since 
March of this year when the STORM Act was 
introduced, staff members on the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee and Sen-
ate Homeland Security and Governmental Af-
fairs Committee worked closely together to 
iron out technical differences and present a 
final bill that can be signed into law by the 
President. 
Throughout the process, we attracted and 
maintained the support of a number of groups 
that partnered together to build the political will 
necessary to pass this bill. In particular, I want 
to thank the American Council of Engineering 
Companies, The American Institute of Archi-
tects, American Society of Civil Engineers, 
American Society of Landscape Architects, 
City Parks Alliance, Ecological Restoration 
Business Association, Interstate Council on 
Water Policy, Mississippi Rivers Cities and 
Towns Initiative, National Recreation and Park 
Association, The Nature Conservancy and 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce for their support. 
As part of the Mississippi Rivers Cities and 
Towns Initiative, I want to give special thanks 
to Executive Director Colin Wellenkamp and 
outgoing Red Wing Mayor Sean Dowse—who 
were also instrumental in this effort. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, passage of the 
STORM Act will be an important step in mak-
ing our towns and cities more resilient. I’m 
thrilled to be leading the bipartisan effort for 
smart, proactive investments in disaster-resil-
ient infrastructure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
3418. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Emergency Management Reform Act of 
2006 to incorporate the recommenda-
tions made by the Government Ac-
countability Office relating to advance 
contracts, and for other purposes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7269 
December 18, 2020 
S. 979 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal Ad-
vance Contracts Enhancement Act’’ or the 
‘‘FACE Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) the Post-Katrina Emergency Manage-
ment and Reform Act of 2006 (Public Law 
109–925; 120 Stat. 1394) required the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency to establish 
advance contracts, which are established 
prior to disasters and are typically needed to 
quickly provide life-sustaining goods and 
services in the immediate aftermath of a dis-
aster; 
(2) 
the 
catastrophic 
hurricanes 
and 
wildfires in the United States in 2017 high-
lighted the importance of these advance con-
tracts in disaster response; 
(3) in a report issued by the Government 
Accountability Office entitled ‘‘2017 Disaster 
Contracting: Action Needed to Better Ensure 
More Effective Use and Management of Ad-
vance Contracts’’, the Government Account-
ability Office identified a number of chal-
lenges with advance contracts and rec-
ommended actions to improve management 
by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency of these contracts for future disas-
ters; and 
(4) section 691 of the Post-Katrina Emer-
gency Management Reform Act of 2006 (6 
U.S.C. 791) should be amended to incorporate 
the recommendations made by the report de-
scribed in paragraph (3) to ensure more effec-
tive use and management of advance con-
tracts. 
SEC. 3. FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT 
AGENCY ADVANCE CONTRACTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 691 of the Post- 
Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act 
of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 791) is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(e) UPDATED REPORT.—Not later than 180 
days after the date of enactment of this sub-
section, the Administrator shall submit to

updated report that contains— 
‘‘(1) the information required in the initial 
report under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of 
subsection (a)(1); and 
‘‘(2) an updated strategy described in sub-
section (a)(1)(C) that clearly defines— 
‘‘(A) the objectives of advance contracts; 
‘‘(B) how advance contracts contribute to 
disaster response operations of the Agency; 
‘‘(C) how to maximize the award of advance 
contracts to small business concerns, as de-
fined in section 3 of the Small Business Act 
(15 U.S.C. 632); and 
‘‘(D) whether and how advance contracts 
should be prioritized in relation to new post- 
disaster contract awards. 
‘‘(f) ADDITIONAL DUTIES
OF
THE ADMINIS-
TRATOR.— 
‘‘(1) HEAD OF CONTRACTING.—The Adminis-
trator shall ensure that the head of con-
tracting activity of the Agency— 
‘‘(A) not later than 270 days after the date 
of enactment of this subsection, updates the 
Disaster Contracting Desk Guide of the 
Agency to provide specific guidance— 
‘‘(i) on whether and under what cir-
cumstances contracting officers should con-
sider using existing advance contracts en-
tered into in accordance with this section 
prior to making new post-disaster contract 
awards, and include this guidance in existing 
semi-annual training given to contracting 
officers; and 
‘‘(ii) for contracting officers to perform 
outreach to State and local governments on 
the potential benefits of establishing their 
own pre-negotiated advance contracts; 
‘‘(B) adheres to hard copy contract file 
management requirements in effect to en-

ment Agency in implementing the rec-
ommendations of the Government Account-
ability Office in the report entitled ‘‘2017 
Disaster Contracting: Action Needed to Bet-
ter Ensure More Effective Use and Manage-
ment of Advance Contracts’’, as required 
under section 691 of the Post-Katrina Emer-
gency Management Reform Act of 2006 (6 
U.S.C. 791), as amended by subsection (a). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
RODNEY
DAVIS) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on S. 979. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 979, the Federal Advance Contracts 
Enhancement Act. This bipartisan and 
bicameral bill introduced in the Senate 
by Senators RUBIO, PETERS, JOHNSON, 
and TILLIS, and in the House by Rep-
resentatives BENNIE THOMPSON, DONALD 
PAYNE, Jr., MIKE ROGERS, and PETER 
KING addresses the findings of the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office’s report 
titled ‘‘2017 Disaster Contracting: Ac-
tions Needed to Better Ensure More Ef-
fective Use and Management of Ad-
vance Contracts.’’ 
In its report, GAO found several 
issues with the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency’s handling of ad-
vance contracts, including limitations 
in the agency’s use of some advance 
contracts, Congressional committees 
being provided with incomplete infor-
mation in FEMA reports, and coordina-
tion with States and localities on the 
use of advance contracts. 
b 1230 
GAO made final recommendations, 
including that FEMA update its strat-
egy and guidance to clarify the use of 
advance contracts, improve the timeli-
ness of its acquisition planning activi-
ties, revise its methodology for report-
ing disaster contracting actions to con-
gressional committees, and provide 
more consistent guidance and informa-
tion to contracting officers to coordi-
nate with and encourage States and lo-
calities to establish advance contracts. 
FEMA concurred with all of GAO’s 
recommendations. 
Following Hurricane Katrina, Con-
gress required FEMA to establish ad-
vance contracts for goods and services 
to enable the Federal Government to 
quickly mobilize resources to affected 
areas in the aftermath of a disaster. 
This bill allows FEMA to ensure 
more effective use and management of 
its advance contracts process by incor-
porating GAO’s recommendations to 
ensure that Federal preparedness ac-
tions are coordinated to prevent gaps 
in recovery efforts from occurring. 
The bill also requires FEMA to regu-
larly update the appropriate commit-
tees of Congress on the progress of the 
agency’s implementation of these rec-
ommendations. 
Given this year’s unprecedented level 
of disaster activity, it is critical that 
Congress enact these reforms ahead of 
the start of the next disaster season in 
order to ensure that both FEMA and 
our States, Tribes, territories, and lo-
calities are well-prepared and equipped 
for future disasters. 
Madam Speaker, I support S. 979, and 
I urge my colleagues to do the same. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, S. 979, the Federal 
Advance Contracts Enhancement Act, 
or FACE Act, will improve disaster 
preparedness and ensure State and 
local governments receive more con-
sistent guidance from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency. 
Following Hurricane Katrina, Con-
gress directed FEMA to establish ad-
vance contracts ahead of disasters to

rapidly provide goods and services fol-
lowing a disaster. 
Following the 2017 hurricanes and 
wildfires, the Government Account-
ability Office reviewed the use of ad-
vance contracts and identified a num-
ber of shortcomings, including unclear 
guidance and inconsistent information 
from FEMA on using these advance 
contracts. 
Ultimately, GAO issued nine rec-
ommendations, and FEMA has con-
curred with every single one of them. 
This bill would require FEMA to pro-
vide an updated report on advance con-
tracts, updated its strategy, improve 
its guidance for FEMA personnel, and 
regularly 
report 
to 
Congress 
on 
progress 
in 
addressing 
GAO’s 
rec-
ommendations. 
These reforms will help improve our 
disaster preparedness and provide clar-
ity to States and local communities on 
how to better leverage these useful 
contracts. 
I am proud to stand with my col-
league, Ms. NORTON, to support this bill 
in a bipartisan way because, if there is 
one thing that the Federal Government 
should do right, it is to help commu-
nities recover from disasters they had 
nothing to do with. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, the 
gentleman has yielded, and I certainly 
concur with him. I am very pleased 
that this bill comes out now, in the 
season of climate change, where we 
have seen increased disasters in our 
country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
979. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution

DRONE ADVISORY COMMITTEE 
FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 2730) to establish and ensure an 
inclusive and transparent Drone Advi-
sory Committee. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2730 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Drone Advi-
sory Committee for the 21st Century Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the Sense of Congress that: 
(1) Due to the ever-increasing use of Un-
manned Aircraft Systems in the agriculture, 
forestry, and rangeland sectors, as well as 
the inherently different uses in less popu-
lated parts of the nation, membership of the 
Drone Advisory Committee established by 
the Federal Aviation Administration should, 
to the extent practicable, include direct rep-
resentatives from county and tribal govern-
ment, agriculture, forestry, and rangeland 
interests. 
(2) Full transparency in the work of the 
Drone Advisory Committee is vital to ensur-
ing the public can effectively participate and 
contribute to the development of sound Fed-
eral policies. The Administrator of the Fed-
eral Aviation Administration should, to the 
maximum extent practicable, ensure the 
work of the Drone Advisory Committee is 
shared with and easily accessible to the pub-
lic and shall ensure transparency and open-
ness in the manner in which the affairs of 
the Committee are conducted. 
SEC. 3. DRONE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBER-
SHIP. 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration shall take appropriate steps to 
encourage direct representation of county 
and tribal governments as well as agri-
culture, forestry, rangeland sectors, and 
other rural interests on the Drone Advisory 
Committee. 
(2) PUBLIC
PARTICIPATION.—To the max-
imum extent practicable, the Administrator 
shall include public participation in the 
process of nominating individuals for mem-
bership on the Committee. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
RODNEY
DAVIS) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 2730. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 2730, the Drone Advisory Committee 
for the 21st Century Act, introduced by 
Senator PETERS of Michigan. 
The number of unmanned aircraft 
systems, or drones, in the United 
States airspace has grown exponen-
tially in recent years. The growth is 
expected to continue, as drones are de-
ployed for more and more uses each 
year. Drones have become important 
tools to assist with everything from in-
frastructure inspection and lifesaving 
missions to delivering medical supplies 
and prescriptions. 
As the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion continues its efforts to safely inte-
grate drones into the National Air-
space System, the work of the Drone 
Advisory Committee, an FAA advisory 
committee that provides the agency 
with advice and recommendations on 
key drone integration issues, will con-
tinue to play an important role in such 
efforts. 
The Drone Advisory Committee is 
currently comprised of executives from 
a cross-section of interested stake-
holders, 
including 
academia, 
drone 
manufacturers and operators, aviation 
labor, and local governments, among 
others. While drones are increasingly 
being used in the agriculture, forestry, 
and rangeland sectors and by county 
and Tribal governments, these stake-
holders are not represented adequately 
in the current committee makeup. 
S. 2730 would, therefore, require the 
FAA to take appropriate steps to en-
courage the direct representation of 
county and Tribal governments, as well 
as agriculture, forestry, rangeland sec-
tors, and other rural interests, on the 
Drone Advisory Committee. The bill 
will also require the FAA to include 
public participation in the process of 
nominating individuals for advisory 
committee membership going forward. 
The efforts outlined in S. 2730 will 
not only include transparency and 
openness in how the Drone Advisory 
Committee’s 
membership 
is 
con-
structed, but they will also help ensure 
the insights of stakeholders, with vast 
experience operating drones and per-
spectives regarding their integration, 
are reflected in the advisory commit-
tee’s important work, ultimately in-
forming future FAA decisionmaking. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation, I urge my colleagues to do the 
same, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I again rise in sup-
port of another great piece of bipar-
tisan legislation, S. 2730, the Drone Ad-
visory Committee for the 21st Century 
Act. 
The Drone Advisory Committee is a 
long-term advisory committee that 
provides the Federal Aviation Adminis-
tration with advice on key drone inte-
gration issues. 
S. 2730 directs the FAA to ensure 
that there is broad participation on 
this committee that develops policies 
for unmanned aircraft systems, or 
drones, and their growing uses. 
S. 2730 also directs the FAA to con-
sider public opinion when nominating 
anyone to serve on the Drone Advisory 
Committee. 
Imagine that, a government agency 
asking the public, who is intricately 
involved in issues related to drone 
technology and the ability to use 
drones in and around our public air-
space—imagine having public opinion 
determine who should be best to serve. 
This is another example where Re-
publicans and Democrats have come to-
gether to offer solutions. It is sad we 
have to put them on paper, to put them 
into legislation sometimes; but here we 
are today, and I am glad it is hap-
pening. 
Having committee participation from 
those in rural areas, especially, will

help those in agribusiness, like in the 
13th District of Illinois, my district, 
where agriculture is king and is so 
much a part of our local economy. 
They depend on drones. 
The growing use of drones and un-
manned aircraft in this field are affect-
ing wide swaths of the country. When 
you look at my district, we have to 
start talking about some of the other 
drone issues that I and my colleagues 
on the Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture Committee have worked on over 
the last few years that I have been 
blessed to serve in this institution. 
It was an amendment I offered to a 
previous FAA reauthorization that al-
lowed for microdrones to have a cat-
egory in and of itself. We don’t need 
this committee actively trying to in-
fluence what we would consider the 
hobby aircraft industry. If a drone is 
below 4.4 pounds, we believe anyone 
who wants to utilize this technology 
should have the opportunity to do so. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support S. 2730, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I want to say in clos-
ing, I encourage all Members to sup-
port this bill. 
I also want to say thank you to the 
colleagues that don’t get a chance to 
come back here on January 3, like Mr. 
CUNNINGHAM and so many of my other 
friends. These are good people who 
served in a great institution where we 
worked together to make sure we made 
this country a better place. I thank 
them for their service. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, as is 
often the case, it is difficult for Con-
gress to stay ahead of the technology 
that it must regulate. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
2730. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the Repub-
lican whip and I have been discussing 
where we are and to bring Members up 
to speed on what status we have for 
today and the next few days. 
Mr. Speaker, as everybody in the 
House knows, and America knows, as 
of midnight tonight, the government 
will run out of authority to operate 
and run out of funds, authorization, to 
be spent. As a result, everybody is 
working very, very hard on both sides, 
the Senate and the House, to try to 
come to agreement not only with re-
spect to funding of the government, 
but also with respect to the response to 
COVID–19 and the pandemic that af-
flicts our people and has afflicted our 
economy in a very negative way. So we 
are trying to get to an agreement, try-
ing to get paper done. 
Mr. Speaker, I have told the Repub-
lican whip that we intend to ask for a 
recess until 5 o’clock this afternoon, 
which would give us 3 more hours to 
work on both the discussions. And I 
just got off the phone with the Speak-
er, who just got off the phone with Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, and so we are hoping 
that, in the next 3 hours, we will have 
a clearer picture of where we are. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), my 
friend. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
As the gentleman from Maryland 
pointed out, we know government 
funding expires at midnight. Clearly, 
we have been working for days in a 
very productive way to get close to an 
agreement on both funding of govern-
ment as well as COVID relief. We are 
not quite there on all of these details, 
but we are eager to see if we can get 
this resolved. 
As the gentleman knows, everybody, 
Members on both sides are very inter-
ested in finding out what the schedule 
will be. I appreciate that update, and I 
imagine that means we will stay tuned 
and see if, between now and 5 p.m., we 
can get that resolved. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. 
For the general Membership, I would 
urge them, however, to keep tonight 
free, tomorrow free, Sunday free, and 
such days thereafter as we may need— 
and I hope we do not need any of those 
days—so that we can, A, pass funding 
for the balance of the fiscal year until 
September 30 of next year, and that we 
can give the kind of relief that, frank-
ly, Mr. SCALISE and I have been talking 
about for the last 3 weeks, for small 
businesses, people on unemployment 
insurance, people who are having trou-
ble putting food on their table, trans-
portation systems that are about to 
shut down, and other relief that both 
sides are trying to come to an agree-
ment on. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to 
keep their schedule free, essentially, 
for such days as it takes to accomplish 
those two objectives. 
Unless the gentleman wants to say 
something further, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess subject to 
the call of the Chair. 
Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 15 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
f 
b 1700 
AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker pro 
tempore (Mr. CORREA) at 5 p.m. 
f 
FURTHER 
ADDITIONAL 
CON-
TINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 
2021 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the joint 
resolution (H.J. Res. 107) making fur-
ther continuing appropriations for fis-
cal year 2021, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the joint 
resolution. 
The text of the joint resolution is as 
follows: 
H.J. RES. 107 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
That the Continuing Appropriations Act, 
2021 (division A of Public Law 116–159) is fur-
ther amended by striking the date specified 
in section 106(3) and inserting ‘‘December 20, 
2020’’. 
This joint resolution may be cited as the 
‘‘Further Additional Continuing Appropria-
tions Act, 2021’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. LOWEY) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
DIAZ- 
BALART) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.J. Res. 
107, currently under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, families and small busi-
nesses desperately need support as they 
continue to reel from the coronavirus 
pandemic. As we speak, bipartisan ne-
gotiations are ongoing to deliver emer-
gency relief alongside an omnibus com-
prising fiscal year 2021 appropriations 
bills. 
To keep government open while nego-
tiations conclude, the legislation be-
fore us extends funding at current lev-
els through Sunday. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the ongoing 
talks by adopting this clean continuing 
resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today also in sup-
port of this short-term continuing res-
olution. There have been negotiations 
taking place day and night for weeks 
now to reach an agreement on a full- 
year appropriations bill and, very im-
portantly, a coronavirus relief bill. 
The negotiations are moving forward. 
We are very close to a final package, 
but there is a little bit more time re-
quired to get this legislation finalized 
and drafted. Passing this CR is simply 
a very short-term, stopgap measure to 
allow those negotiations to finalize. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting in favor of this, 
again, very short-term resolution, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I urge its 
support, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
LOWEY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the joint resolution, H.J. 
Res. 107. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 320, nays 60, 
not voting 49, as follows:

SCHEDULE UPDATE 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
notify all the Members, and we will 
certainly do that by email as well, that 
the negotiators who are trying to come 
to an agreement between the two par-
ties, and the House and the Senate as 
well, are still working very hard to 
reach agreement both on the omnibus 
so that we will be able to fund the gov-
ernment through September 30 of this 
coming year and on the response to 
COVID–19, both from a health stand-
point and from an economic stand-
point. We are hopeful that they will 
reach agreement in the near future. 
They have not reached one yet. There 
are still some significant issues out-
standing. 
In light of that, I am announcing 
that there will be no votes tomorrow. 
Even if an agreement were reached late 
tonight, the administrative work nec-
essary to memorialize that agreement 
in a bill would take at least 18 hours or 
thereabouts, so that the first—next 
votes that would be anticipated would 
be at 1 p.m. on Sunday. 
This is a change. Some people had 
heard 2, and I had used 2, but we are ac-
celerating that to 1 p.m. on Sunday. 
Members will receive 2 hours’ notice 
for that vote, so that would mean, if it 
is at 1 p.m., you will receive a notice at 
11 a.m. That ought to give time for 
Members, obviously, most of whom are 
going to be staying in town if they 
don’t live close by, to go to worship 
and then come to the House floor. 
But no votes before 1 p.m. on Sunday, 
this coming Sunday, and notice will be 
given 2 hours prior to 1 p.m., so by 11 
a.m.

BOSTON TEA PARTY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this 
week in 1773, Sam Adams and the Sons 
of Liberty organized the Boston Tea 
Party, one of the most iconic protests 
in American history. They dumped 342 
chests of tea into the Boston Harbor in 
an uprising against an oppressive gov-
ernment and taxation tyranny. 
Three years ago this month, Repub-
licans built upon our Founders’ ideals 
and passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
We delivered pro-growth, pro-jobs, and 
pro-America policies to end the eco-
nomic slowdown of the previous admin-
istration. 
Following tax reform, the middle 
class 
experienced 
record 
financial 
growth, household incomes soared by 
nearly 8 percent, and Americans had a 
greater say over their own paychecks. 
Our 
Founders 
knew 
lower 
taxes 
would be better for the economy of 
1773, and Republicans proved through 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 3 years ago 
that Sam Adams and the Sons of Lib-
erty were correct.

PUBLIC HOUSING IN ATLANTA 
(Mr. HALL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1

marks.) 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
mindful that I only have a few mo-
ments to address this body from the 
podium. 
As we turn our attention next week 
to Christmas, many of us are sending

deliver more than 155 billion pieces of 
mail per year, which this year included 
our ballots in an election that saw the 
largest turnout in 100 years. For their 
work and commitment this holiday 
season and every holiday season, and 
for their extraordinary service to our 
country during the pandemic, I support 
overtime pay for these important civil 
servants. 
Another institution very old in our 
Republic, while not as old as the Postal 
Service, is Morris Brown College. Let 
us resolve to support Morris Brown 
College and contribute to the revital-
ization of the Atlanta University Cen-
ter. 
As we seek to revitalize Morris 
Brown College, let us also consider 
ways to renew our urban centers. A 
way to do that is urban farming. It can 
deliver produce at a lower cost, leaving 
families to spend on other costs of liv-
ing, like housing. It can also be good 
for the environment, as it can reduce 
CO2 emissions attendant with trans-
porting food from faraway farms to 
urban centers. 
While we do this and we emerge from 
this pandemic, we must lift as we rise. 
That is why we must ensure minority- 
and women-owned businesses see in-
creased participation in our society. 
One of the items I will include in the 
RECORD is a news story about 27 former 
African-American franchisees who are 
suing McDonald’s, a legendary busi-
ness, for discrimination against its own 
franchisees. 
27 MORE BLACK EX-FRANCHISEES JOIN RACIAL 
DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT AGAINST MCDON-
ALD’S 
TOTAL NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS APPROACHING 80 
MIAMI, Nov. 18, 2020—Twenty-seven new 
plaintiffs, 
all 
former 
Black 
McDonald’s 
franchisees, joined an ongoing federal law-
suit against the fast-food chain claiming the 
company engaged in systemic discrimination 
and denied them the same opportunities as 
White franchisees. 
The new amended complaint now has 77 
named plaintiffs in the lawsuit originally 
filed by 52 Black former franchisees on Sept. 
1, 2020. 
The claims now include nearly 300 stores 
with compensatory damages that average be-
tween $4 million and $5 million per store, ex-
clusive of punitive damages. 
The plaintiffs allege McDonald’s sold itself 
as a recruiter and developer of Black talent, 
profited from its Black consumer base and 
maintained a two-tier system that pigeon-
holed unsuspecting Black owners and as-
signed them horrible locations guaranteed to 
fail. 
This suit comes on the heels of a federal 
class action lawsuit filed October 29 by cur-
rent Black franchisees. 
‘‘McDonald’s is now fighting a four-front 
legal war. They are being sued by current 
and former Black operators, Black employ-
ees and senior executives,’’ said James L. 
Ferraro, the lead attorney for both the cur-
rent and former franchisee lawsuits. ‘‘As the 
pool of plaintiffs grow, there will be more 
pressure on the company to dispense with 
the public relations ploys and focus on how 
it 
can 
help 
its 
Black 
employees 
and 
franchisees.’’ 
At the same time there are calls for state 
pension funds to drop McDonald’s stock. 
States like New York, California, Ohio and 
Florida have massive investments in McDon-
ald’s. In Tennessee, Rep. Joe Towns has re-
quested Treasurer David H. Lillard to divest 
the state’s holdings and reallocate the 
money toward companies ‘‘practicing good 
corporate citizenship.’’ 
Ferraro said all these challenges are com-
ing together because the company has 
turned a blind eye to obvious racial problems 
while promoting its public image. 
McDonald’s once boasted a high of 377 
Black franchisees in 1998. That number now 
stands at 186 even though McDonald’s has in-
creased its stores from 15,086 to 36,059. The 
cash flow gap for Black franchisees more 
than tripled from 2010 to 2019, per National 
Black McDonald’s Operators Association 
(‘‘NBMOA’’) data. 
Plaintiffs’ average annual sales of $2 mil-
lion was more than $700,000 under McDon-
ald’s national average of $2.7 million between 
2011 and 2016 and $900,000 under the national 
average of $2.9 million in 2019. 
The lawsuit claims McDonald’s was ruth-
less in steering Black operators toward the 
oldest, most decrepit stores in the toughest 
neighborhoods routinely rejected by Whites 
franchisees. This severely limited opportuni-
ties for expansion and growth, and far too 
often set in place a chain of events—low cash 
flow, decreased equity, debt and bank-
ruptcy—that led to financial ruin. 
The plaintiffs argue McDonald’s violated 
federal civil rights laws by: 
Excluding Black franchisees from the same 
growth opportunities found at safer, higher- 
volume, lower-cost stores offered to Whites. 
Retaliating against Black franchisees for 
rejecting strong-arm offers to continue oper-
ations in crime-ridden neighborhoods. 
Denying Black franchisees meaningful as-
sistance during financial hardships while 
White franchisees were routinely given such 
support. 
Failing to provide any legitimate business 
reasons for repeated denials of franchise op-
portunities over many years. 
Unfairly grading the operations of Black 
restaurants, which resulted in poor internal 
reviews, 
effectively 
pushing 
Black 
franchisees out of the McDonald’s system by 
denying them the eligibility for growth and 
favorable franchise terms. 
Providing misleading projections which in-
duced Black franchisees to purchase undesir-
able franchises. 
The amended complaint was filed with the 
U.S. District Court for the Northern District 
of Illinois Eastern Division. 
Mr. HALL. We must ensure that all 
in this Nation have the promise of the 
American Dream free from discrimina-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today mindful that I only 
have a few moments to address this body 
from the podium so I ask unanimous consent 
to place extended remarks and materials into 
the record on all these topics but I would like 
to briefly alert to this body the areas of con-
cern that I seek placed into the RECORD. 
The first concerns housing. In Atlanta, we 
have a tremendous opportunity to expedite the 
redevelopment of vacant public housing sites 
including: Bowen Hornes, Bankhead Court, 
Hollywood court, Harris Hornes, Thomasville, 
and Jonesboro North and South. And I hope 
the days ahead achieve that end. 
All of these sites have the potential to not 
only incorporate affordable housing, but the 
addition of grocery stores in food desserts; 
healthcare facilities, improved access to public 
transportation; job and commercial centers, 
quality schools and parks and greenspace. 
And as we turn our attention next week to 
Christmas, many of us are sending and await-
ing cards and packages. Let us not forget the 
Postal workers who deliver more than 155 bil-
lion pieces of mail per year, which this year in-
cluded our ballots in an election that saw the 
largest turnout in 100 years. For their work 
and commitment this season and every holi-
day season, and for their extraordinary service 
to our country during a pandemic, I support 
overtime pay for these important civil servants. 
And another institution very old in our Re-
public, while not as old as the Postal Service, 
is Morris Brown College. Let us resolve to 
support Morris Brown College and contribute 
to the revitalization of the Atlanta University 
Center. 
As we seek to revitalize Morris Brown Col-
lege, let us also consider ways to renew our 
urban centers. A way to do that is urban farm-
ing. 
It can deliver produce at a lower cost, leav-
ing families to spend on other costs of living, 
like housing. 
It can also be good for the environment, as 
it can reduce CO2 emissions attendant with 
transporting food from faraway farms to urban 
centers. 
As we improve our nation’s housing, and 
find ways to revitalize our colleges and seek 
new ways to grow our food, let us not forget 
our past. That is why it is important for this 
Chamber to try to preserve our past. This in-
cludes the task of establishing the former 
headquarters of the Southern Christian Lead-
ership Conference, where Dr. King did his 
work, alongside Congressman Lewis, as na-
tional historic sites. 
And, while we do this, and we emerge from 
this pandemic, we must lift as we rise. That is 
why we must ensure minority and women 
owned businesses see increased rates in our 
society. 
One of the items I will be placing in the 
record is a news story about 27 former African 
American franchisees who are suing McDon-
alds, a legendary business, for discrimination 
against its own franchisees. We must ensure 
that all in this nation have the promise of the 
American dream, free from discrimination. 
We must also ensure that legacy banks and 
black-owned banks are sources of capital to 
support financing of projects for minority com-
munities. 
And, finally, during my time in here in Cap-
itol Hill, I have introduced many pieces of leg-
islation designed at making our criminal justice 
system fairer. But during this pandemic, we 
must also not forget about our brothers and 
sisters that are incarcerated. A study I will 
place in the record, from The Marshall Project, 
makes clear that incarcerated individuals are 4 
times more likely to contract COVID–19. As 
society begins the long process of distributing 
and administering the vaccine, we must not 
forget them. They are no less worthy or de-
serving of medical care and should protected, 
for we are all God’s children.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7276 
December 18, 2020 
After being born and raised in a fam-
ily of farmers in Japan, Andy got an 
educational visa to go to California and 
study agriculture. He liked it so much 
that he bought some land and estab-
lished a nursery in the Salinas Valley, 
in my district. 
Andy produced orchids and pioneered 
the sale of potted orchids in stores. 
Today, the Matsui Nursery has one of 
the greatest selections of orchids in the 
entire world. 
But Andy didn’t just grow flowers; he 
grew the future for many. Andy said 
that education is the only way to 
change things in this world. That is 
why he and his wife established the 
Matsui Foundation to provide scholar-
ships to countless students. Andy be-
lieved in our home by encouraging 
those students to not just study, but to 
stay and give back to the central coast 
of California. 
Our prayers are with his family. May 
Andy Matsui rest in peace with the sat-
isfaction that he left us with magnifi-
cent beauty from his orchids and mag-
nanimous bounty for our community.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, 2020 
No. 215 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, our shield and fortress, we 
thank You for Your unfailing love. 
Look with favor upon our Senators. 
Guide them around the obstacles that 
hinder their progress, uniting them for 
the common good of this great land. 
Lord, enable them to go from strength 
to strength as they fulfill Your pur-
poses for their lives in this generation. 
Striving to please You, help them to 
stand for right and leave the con-
sequences to You. Lord, give them a 
sense of partnership with You in seek-
ing Your best for all phases of our na-
tional life. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
f 
2020 ELECTION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there 
has been a lot of finger wagging across 
the aisle by both Senate and House 
Democrats about accepting election re-
sults. Most of that has been related to 
whether or not Trump would concede 
the results of the election to Biden. 
But, obviously, there is somewhat of a 
double standard because these same 
Democrats are mum about a looming 
challenge to the certified results of the 
election of Iowa’s Second Congres-
sional District. 
Representative-Elect 
Miller-Meeks 
won by six votes, and that was after 
careful recounts conducted and cer-
tified on a bipartisan basis according 
to Iowa law. On election night, the 
Democratic candidate lost. A few days 
later, two counties were recounted, and 
the Democratic candidate still lost. 
Then the Democratic candidate asked 
for a recount of all 24 counties, and 
after that recount, the Democratic 
candidate lost. A day later, the sec-
retary of state of Iowa certified the 
election, just like the secretaries of 
state of our 50 States certified their 
elections in the Presidential election. 
Now the Democratic opponent chose 
not to make a case under Iowa law to 
a judicial panel headed by the chief 
justice of Iowa, presumably because 
there was no legal case. 
Now what happens? The next step is 
that candidate, under a 1969 Federal 
law, can ask the House of Representa-
tives to set aside Iowa’s election law 
and overturn Iowa’s certified election 
results through a purely political proc-
ess, which could presumably have a 
Democratic majority of 222 in the U.S. 
House overturn the votes of 400,000 
Iowans. 
Now, getting back to what seems to 
be a double standard, if Democratic 
leaders do not nip this in the bud now, 
they have no room to point fingers at 
any other Member of Congress. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, our 
bipartisan discussions are continuing 
to make significant headway toward 
another relief package for the Amer-
ican people. The Democratic leader, 
Speaker PELOSI, Leader MCCARTHY, 
and I have been working around the 
clock for several days now. The talks 
remain productive. In fact, I am even 
more optimistic now than I was last 
night that a bipartisan, bicameral 
framework for a major rescue package 
is very close at hand. 
Well, let’s face it, though, it doesn’t 
help struggling Americans keep their 
jobs or endure unemployment or pay 
their rent or get vaccines any faster to 
keep hearing that we are having good 
discussions. What families across the 
country deserve—what they have need-
ed and deserved for months now—is an 
outcome, another targeted relief pack-
age to get more assistance into their 
hands as fast as possible. 
Struggling small business owners 
have already waited too long for a tar-
geted second round of PPP. Laid-off 
workers have already waited too long 
to have expiring programs extended. 
Kids, teachers, and families have al-
ready waited too long for funding to 
help schools reopen safely. We have al-
ready waited too long to fully fund vac-
cine distributions so our scientists’ his-
toric sprint toward a safe and effective 
vaccine is followed up by an equally 
important logistical effort. 
This has been an unbelievably hard 
year for our country. We have seen nor-
mal daily life grind to a halt and take 
a record-setting economy right down 
with it. And even as we have watched 
doctors, nurses, and researchers make 
lifesaving history, we have lost more 
than 300,000 Americans entirely too 
soon. 
Like I have said, the Senate will be 
right here until an agreement is 
passed, whenever that may be. We will 
just continue voting. There are some 
more well-qualified nominees for im-
portant posts that we can confirm in 
the meantime. So let’s finish our busi-
ness for the American people.

TRIBUTE TO PHIL MAXSON

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7648 
December 18, 2020 
I jump at any opportunity to praise my 
incredible staff. I am just sorry that 
one natural occasion is when great peo-
ple head toward the exits. 
Phil Maxson of Lexington, KY, has 
mastered one of the toughest jobs on 
Capitol Hill. As chief of staff for my 
personal office, he oversees the oper-
ation that delivers for Kentucky fami-
lies and Kentucky priorities. 
Here is what that role means in our 
tight-knit organization. It is like being 
the player-coach on an old baseball 
team who is also a utility player at the 
same time. Phil wears about 10 hats 
each day, orchestrating a seamless op-
eration. He has mastered policy, polit-
ical strategy, messaging, and con-
stituent services. He has budgeted and 
managed the office itself, and Phil is 
also a liaison and colleague to my lead-
ership office here in the Capitol. 
He is the linkage between the two 
sides of my operation, the single person 
most responsible for helping me har-
monize home-State priorities with my 
national duties and keep the Common-
wealth at the center of all I do. It is a 
tall order. It takes the best of the best, 
someone who is so capable that every 
important issue will involve them, but 
so humble that situations never be-
come about them. Enter Phil Maxson— 
a kind, cheerful, and unbelievably con-
fident servant leader whom I am con-
vinced nobody in this planet dislikes. 
Phil climbed the Capitol Hill ladder 
the old-fashioned way. He joined my 
team as an intern a decade ago. Actu-
ally, I think Phil may have snuck a 
late application into a last-minute 
opening. If I am right about that, then 
his good fortune was ours as well. 
He has done every job: legislative 
correspondent, 
legislative 
assistant, 
legislative director, and then the top 
spot. 
As one of his old bosses reminded me 
recently, ‘‘every time a gap in the of-
fice appeared, Phil was the natural 
choice’’ to fill it. It is not like he el-
bowed his way up. It is that cir-
cumstances and our needs kept pulling 
him up. He is that good. 
For the past decade, Phil has walked 
into every meeting, every markup, 
every normal day at the office, and 
every grueling far-flung codel with 
total 
preparation, 
complete 
profes-
sionalism, and the score of the latest 
UK game. 
Another former supervisor of his put 
it this way: ‘‘I don’t think I ever asked 
Phil a single question he didn’t already 
know the answer to, or didn’t find the 
answer within about 10 minutes.’’ That 
is high praise when your portfolio 
ranges from U.S.-Burma relations to 
the BUILD grants that improve our 
roads and everything in between. 
It helps that Phil is a Kentucky thor-
oughbred through and through. The 
man really is ‘‘dyed in the bluegrass.’’ 
As a young man in Lexington, he found 
part-time work giving tours at Henry 
Clay’s Ashland estate. He also grad-
uated from Henry Clay High School. 
You could say the Senate was a nat-
ural destination. Here, he met UK 
Coach Calipari, President Netanyahu, 
and families from Kentucky’s smallest 
towns. And they all got exactly the 
same 
attention, 
enthusiasm, 
and 
warmth from Phil Maxson. 
He clicks with everyone. He is as af-
fable as he is intelligent. In a town full 
of big egos and sharp elbows, he stands 
out because he doesn’t try to stand out. 
For the better part of a decade, vir-
tually every significant win we have 
notched for our Commonwealth has 
had Phil at its nucleus. But if you drop 
by the staff meeting the day after, 
what you would hear is Phil explaining 
why everyone else deserves more credit 
than he does, why it really all came 
down to my leadership or his peers’ ef-
forts or the hard work of the junior 
folks beneath him—in other words, ev-
eryone else but him. 
You would have to go to everyone 
else to learn that Phil was the human 
glue that, in fact, held it all together. 
It would take me all day to list every 
win Phil helped quarterback for our 
home State: a state-of-the-art chem-
ical weapons destruction facility in 
Madison County, the transfer of the 
Rochester Dam to local ownership, a 
new wildlife refuge in Henderson Coun-
ty, environmental cleanup and health 
benefits for nuclear workers in Padu-
cah, the planned construction of a new 
VA hospital in Louisville, Freedom to 
Fish and the raising of Lake Cum-
berland, and many, many more. 
But, alas, his dedication to Kentucky 
is so all-encompassing that he and his 
wife Sarah Beth have decided they 
don’t want to raise their young family 
anywhere else. 
So ‘‘Bee and Phil on Capitol Hill’’—as 
friends have called them—plus their 
two boys, Barbour and Theodore, are 
homeward bound. 
I made the same decision myself as a 
young man, trading in the life of a Sen-
ate staffer for a move back home. So I 
can’t exactly fault his decision. 
Phil needs to spend fewer breakfasts 
and dinners with me and more with his 
own burgeoning clan. I get it, but I am 
sure sorry to see him go. 
Phil is the kind of Senate all-star 
who deserves a full-dress curtain call. 
He deserves toasts and a dinner and a 
big farewell party. I regret that in 
these bizarre pandemic times, a floor 
speech will have to suffice, at least 
right now. 
So, Phil, thank you for your years of 
dedication to the State we both love. 
We will miss your brain. We will miss 
your heart. You are leaving behind one 
heck of a fan club all throughout the 
U.S. Senate. We wish you all the best 
in the chapters ahead.

DECEMBER 19 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want 
to make an observation here because I 
have been serving for quite some time 
in the U.S. Senate, and a lot of the 
things that are said on the Senate floor 
are not really all that significant, and 
yet the Members who are delivering 
messages believe they are or they 
wouldn’t be doing it. This is what it is 
all about. This is a deliberative body. 
Some things are maybe not all that 
significant, but what I am about to say 
is significant, so I would like to have 
the attention of anyone who wants to 
know that in the midst of all of the 
problems that we are facing now, some 
good things are happening. 
I want to mention something that is 
significant that I don’t think you have 
thought of, I say to the Presiding Offi-
cer; that is, tomorrow is the 354th day 
of the year, and that is very signifi-
cant. That is December 19. People have 
not stopped to realize the significant 
things that have happened on Decem-
ber 19 throughout our history and the 
history of the world, going all the way 
back to December 19 of the year 1154. 
That is when Henry II became King of 
England. We haven’t really thought 
about what that means to us today, but 
we will before long. 
In 1843, December 19, Charles Dickens 
wrote ‘‘A Christmas Carol.’’ That is the 
most watched, listened to, and sung 
event every Christmas. And it has been 
for all that time. 
In 1932, December 19, the British 
Broadcasting Corporation—that is the 
BBC; we are all familiar with that—but 
that is when it started. On December 
19, they began transmitting overseas. 
That was the beginning of a whole new 
world of knowledge and understanding.

December 18, 2020 
In 1950, December 19, NATO named 
General Dwight D. Eisenhower as su-
preme commander of the Western Eu-
ropean defense forces. 
Then, in 1972, December 19, Apollo 17, 
the last of the Apollo moon landings, 
returned to Earth. 
Then, in 1984, December 19—I remem-
ber this well because I was in Hong 
Kong when this happened—that was 
when China signed an accord returning 
Hong Kong to the Chinese sovereignty. 
A lot of people thought it was a good 
idea at the time to accept the people 
from Hong Kong. I was there, and look 
what has happened now after all these 
years. I would have to say that created 
a hysteria that has continued to this 
day. 
Then, in 1998, December 19, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton was impeached. 
I was there for that one too. That was 
December 19, 1998. 
The event that is more significant by 
a landslide is what happened on Decem-
ber 19 of 1959. On December 19, 1959, my 
wife Kay and I got married. That 
makes tomorrow our 61st wedding an-
niversary. Just look at all of the beau-
ty that has followed us—20 kids and 
grandkids, all of that in a 61-year pe-
riod of time. 
What I want to say is the beautiful 
life that we are still having together— 
and, Kay, I love you more now than I 
did 61 years ago. 
I say to the Senate leadership that 
you better get this last vote done by 
tonight or you will have to do it with-
out me because I am going to be with 
Kay on our anniversary on Saturday, 
our 61st wedding anniversary. 
To everyone else out there, as you 
celebrate the birth of Christ at Christ-
mastime, I am going to say to you: 
Merry Christmas and God bless you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant minority leader. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am 
sorry I didn’t come to the floor quickly 
enough to wish my friend Jim Inhofe 
and his wife the best. He is one of the 
real contributors in the U.S. Senate 
and has been for years. He is a special 
individual. He decided to take an inter-
est in the continent of Africa. I don’t 
know that there is another Senator 
who knows as much about that con-
tinent as he does. He has been there so 
many times. His stories, many of them, 
relate to countries that few people 
have heard of. He has made a special 
point to understand that continent, the 
people on it, in addition to his respon-
sibilities serving the State of Okla-
homa and, of course, now, as chairman 
of the Armed Services Committee, his 
responsibility for funding the Depart-
ment of Defense. He and our Demo-
cratic colleague, Senator JACK REED of 
Rhode Island, have done a remarkable 
bipartisan job on that Defense author-
ization, let me add. 
I sincerely hope that the President 
will sign that bill. His objections to it 
have nothing to do with the military or 
defense of our country. They relate to 
issues 
which 
are 
thorny, 
political 
issues that shouldn’t slow down these 
critical programs. 
This authorization bill comes at an 
exceptional time. We have been learn-
ing over the last few weeks about a 
massive cyber security breach of our 
government, probably by the Russians. 
It has all the earmarks and finger-
prints of Vladimir Putin project to 
compromise our national security and 
to create chaos whenever possible. We 
learned of it 4 years ago in the 2016 
election, when every intelligence agen-
cy of our government agreed that the 
Russians were meddling in our election 
and doing their best to subvert the will 
of the American people. 
We made strong statements in oppo-
sition to it, and we took action. Some 
of it has been publicly reported, and 
some of it has been disclosed to Mem-
bers of Congress in a classified setting. 
We were successful in thwarting their 
efforts in the 2018 election. I want to 
salute all of those who were responsible 
for that effort. In 2020, I believe the 
same can be said. We will know more 
as we sift through the evidence. 
This latest disclosure is really trou-
bling. We believe that beginning in 
March of this year, the Russians start-
ed compromising our cyber security 
network in many different ways. Every 
day there is a new disclosure of an-
other agency that reports that they 
have somehow wheedled their way into 
this important, critical information. 
How much they know, what they have 
gained, how much they have com-
promised us, we don’t know yet. It cer-
tainly is unnerving, and it deserves a 
very 
thorough—thorough—investiga-
tion as to how we failed. 
You see, the United States was not 
taking anything for granted. We were 
literally spending billions—billions—of 
dollars for the safety of the security 
systems. We knew that included in 
those systems was information which 
is essential for the protection of the 
United States. To think that has been 
compromised at the hands of one of our 
implacable foes is certainly unnerving. 
I believe we should initiate a thorough 
and complete investigation, let the 
chips fall where they may, establish 
where we have failed from a technology 
viewpoint, and if any individuals are 
responsible, that they be held account-
able. 
At the same time, I have to say that 
I join the Presiding Officer in com-
menting on one particular aspect of 
this that I just can’t understand. The 
White House has been virtually silent 
as all of these facts have unfolded by 
the day. I cannot understand that— 
why the Commander in Chief of the 
United States of America has not spo-
ken out forcefully against the Russians 
for their involvement in this cyber se-
curity breach, why he has not likened 
this to a virtual invasion of the United 
States when it comes to our own na-
tional security. I believe that we 
should have been firm from the begin-
ning and honest with the American 
people, as well, about the nature of this 
threat. Instead, this President has been 
silent. 
I recall not that long ago, a few 
months ago, we disclosed—we found 
evidence that the Russians were offer-
ing bounties on the heads of American 
soldiers in Afghanistan. It is an out-
rageous and unthinkable act. Yet the 
White House was silent, refused to re-
spond to what I know—because I have 
seen it—was credible evidence that this 
was linked directly to Moscow and the 
operatives of the Russian Government. 
The 
attempted 
assassination 
of 
Navalny, the dissident in Russia, has 
been well documented. Yet, again, our 
White House, our President are silent. 
I don’t understand it. 
I am hopeful that the new President, 
Joe Biden, when he takes office Janu-
ary 20, will make it a priority to estab-
lish a new understanding and relation-
ship with Vladimir Putin. The United 
States cannot be a victim of Putin over 
and over again without speaking out— 
and more. I am counting on Joe Biden 
to do that. I believe he will. He is a re-
alist. I know he wants peace in the 
world, and I do, too, but we also must 
defend this country. The men and 
women in uniform who risk their lives 
every single day should be our highest 
priority. 
I am heartened by Joe Biden’s clos-
ing that he is using in all of his public 
speeches now. He, of course, says it 
more artfully than I will, but he calls 
on God to bless America but also God 
to keep our troops safe. I am sure it 
has special meaning to him since the 
death of his son Beau is a reminder of 
the sacrifices that not only the men 
and women in uniform but their fami-
lies make for us every single day. I 
hope that continues to be the watch-
word of his administration. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, there is not much ac-
tivity on the floor of the Senate today. 
I hope there will be before the end of 
the day. The leaders in the Senate and 
House—Democrat and Republican—as 
well as the White House, with Treasury 
Secretary Mnuchin, are fast at work, 
we are told, establishing a COVID–19 
relief bill. 
I was part of an effort, which the Pre-
siding Officer also shared in. It was a 
volunteer activity that involved about 
3 weeks of endless telephone con-
ferences and Zoom calls. Staff sup-
ported us all the way or we couldn’t 
have done it. 
But it started off with eight of us 
eating dinner one night and deciding to 
come together as a group to see if we 
could break the logjam. The whole no-
tion of COVID–19 relief was dead in the 
water for some reason—no action, no 
activity. 
We remember back in March when 
Congress—particularly, I remember the 
Senate, by a vote of 96 to 0, passed, on 
a bipartisan basis, the largest relief 
bill in the history of the United States. 
It was over $3 trillion in the CARES

December 18, 2020 
Act, which was for addressing and 
fighting the pandemic as its first pri-
ority, but, secondly, trying to rescue 
our floundering economy. 
Thank goodness we did that, and we 
came together. We hoped that it would 
be a short-lived requirement, but it 
turned out to be much longer. Many of 
us anticipated that by the middle of 
this year things would have come 
under control. We know, sadly, that is 
not the case. 
There has been a call ever since to 
step back into this theater of con-
frontation with this pandemic and the 
weakening economy. But for some rea-
son—and I won’t point fingers—we 
have been unable to reach any bipar-
tisan agreement. 
Well, eight of us willful Senators— 
four Democrats and four Republicans— 
set out to try and get the conversation 
started and see what we could agree on. 
It was a great experience. Even though 
there were parts of it where we could 
not agree, and there was a lot of frus-
tration, there was also a lot that was 
constructive and encouraging. 
At the end of the day, we produced 
two documents. One of these docu-
ments was a $748 billion consensus doc-
ument, which spelled out the things 
that we thought were essential as part 
of any COVID relief package—extend-
ing 
unemployment 
benefits 
for 
16 
weeks, including for about 160,000 peo-
ple in my State who claim the pan-
demic unemployment assistance and 
248,000 who claim pandemic emergency 
unemployment compensation. Millions 
of Americans—12 million Americans 
will lose their unemployment com-
pensation on the day after Christmas. 
Imagine that. 
We also, in this bill, provided assist-
ance for small businesses, including the 
second round of Paycheck Protection 
Program loans for the hardest hit busi-
nesses; extended the eviction morato-
rium through January 31, 2021, pro-
viding emergency rental assistance to 
help families stay in their homes; pro-
vided funding for hospitals and clinics 
for testing and to quickly and fairly 
distribute vaccines, including $500 mil-
lion to Illinois for testing and vaccine 
distribution and $1.5 billion for Illinois 
hospitals and healthcare providers. 
We provided $82 billion nationwide 
for education—$54 billion for K–12, $20 
billion for higher ed. We extended the 
Federal student loan forbearance from 
its current expiration, January 31, 2021, 
through April 30, 2021. 
We provided $10 billion nationwide of 
much needed support for the struggling 
childcare sector. 
We addressed hunger by increasing 
SNAP benefits for nearly 2 million in-
dividuals in my State and millions 
more across the United States and by 
providing funding for food banks and 
senior 
nutrition 
programs, 
serving 
more than 1.5 million people in Illinois. 
We provided billions for transit, in-
cluding hundreds of millions of dollars 
for Illinois transit agencies and help 
for Amtrak as well. We provided bil-
lions for airports, including millions of 
dollars for Illinois airports and airline 
relief as well. We provided more than $1 
billion in funding for Amtrak to pre-
vent further furloughs, provided mil-
lions in payroll support to protect jobs 
of thousands of Illinois airline workers, 
and provided funding to help struggling 
Illinois bus companies keep their work-
ers on the job. 
That is not the end of the list, by any 
means. Part of the money we put in 
here was for the logistics of the vac-
cinations which are now taking place 
across the United States. We provided 
some. I think the negotiators are add-
ing to the amount, and I applaud them 
for that. 
What we left out of this, I think, was 
significant too. We did not provide any 
direct assistance to State and local 
governments. This morning, I got on 
the telephone with a group that has 
been kind enough to volunteer for 
many years to consider the applica-
tions of individuals in Illinois who 
want to attend our service academies. 
Some of these people have been doing 
this for 20 years. I really respect them 
and thank them for doing it. I tried to 
take myself out of that consideration 
so no one can ever claim political con-
sideration was taken in any way. 
One of the persons who did part of 
the meeting this morning was Skip 
Lee. Skip is the mayor of Sterling, IL. 
He said to me: Senator, can you pro-
vide any help for COVID relief for 
towns like Sterling, IL? 
I said: Skip, there will be some help, 
I think, but it won’t be the kind of help 
that I wanted. 
I do believe we should help State and 
local governments. I have been re-
minded by the Presiding Officer and 
others that every State is not the 
same, every locality is not the same. 
Some have suffered real losses in rev-
enue directly related to COVID–19 and 
some have prospered. It just depends on 
your circumstances. 
In my circumstance, the State of Illi-
nois has paid a heavy price as a State 
and in the localities as well. We do not 
include the direct relief for State and 
local 
governments, 
which 
I 
hoped 
would be part of this agreement. 
I hope we can return to that issue 
soon, very quickly—after the first of 
the year, perhaps, with the new Presi-
dent—and find a way to provide this re-
lief. 
The alternative is awful. I know what 
is going to happen to a lot of the local 
budgets. Police officers are going to be 
furloughed—firefighters, 
teachers, 
healthcare workers—just at a moment 
in time when we need them the most. 
Many of these communities will be un-
able to continue providing those very 
fundamental services to keep us safe. I 
hope we can get back to that as quick-
ly as possible. 
Finally, let me say that we are all 
anxious to fund this government at 
midnight tonight when the continuing 
resolution, which we passed several 
months, ago expires. It would be a real 
tragedy if we saw this government 
come to a close for any reason at any 
time. And certainly, at this moment, 
when our economy is so tenuous and 
our worries are so large over the 
healthcare of our Nation, we shouldn’t 
allow this to occur. I pray that the ne-
gotiators will be able to spend good 
time today and report to us soon that 
they have reached an agreement. It is 
time for us to get our work done. 
And like Senator INHOFE, who is 
going home for his 61st anniversary, 
many of us are anxious to return to our 
homes and families. We won’t have the 
expansive Christmas this year that we 
have had in the past. We won’t be re-
uniting 
with 
children 
and 
grand-
children who really make the holiday, 
but we are looking at the long run. The 
long run is we want to be around for 
next Christmas. Instead of one tree, we 
are going to have two to make up for 
this year.

Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, in a few 
moments, I am going to ask unanimous 
consent for the Senate to pass S. 2800, 
which is the bipartisan NASA Author-
ization Act. Before doing so, I want to 
make some brief remarks about how 
important this legislation is to Amer-
ican leadership in space and to our con-
tinued space exploration efforts. 
Well over a year ago, I joined with 
Chairman WICKER, Ranking Member 
CANTWELL, and Subcommittee on Avia-
tion 
and 
Space 
Ranking 
Member 
SINEMA, and we began writing the 
NASA Authorization Act, using as a 
foundation the bipartisan bill that I 
had previously authored with Senators 
CORNYN, RUBIO, MARKEY, and then-Sen-
ator Bill Nelson, from the last Con-
gress, as our starting point. We solic-
ited input from hundreds of stake-
holders, from individuals and aca-
demics to industry partners and even 
our international allies. Hundreds of 
pages of suggestions, proposed edits, 
and comments were submitted. Over 
many months, our staffs worked dili-
gently through each and every submis-
sion, trying to incorporate the feed-
back to the greatest extent possible, 
and what resulted is this bill, which 
was marked up last year and unani-
mously reported. 
What we have achieved together is 
legislation that enjoys deep and broad 
bipartisan support and that sets bold 
goals for NASA and the United States 
in space. It provides the direction and

the infrastructure necessary to meet 
them. I am very proud of the work we 
have done together and of this legisla-
tion we have assembled, and I want to 
express particular thanks to Senators 
WICKER, CANTWELL, and SINEMA and to 
their staffs for their hard work. 
Our bill strengthens U.S. leadership 
in space, ensuring that we remain the 
default space exploration partner of 
the world. It extends the life of the 
International Space Station through 
2030, and it challenges us to be the 
international leader for lunar and Mars 
exploration and to reach new horizons. 
It is not just human exploration, 
though. By working in a collegial and 
good-faith manner, we were able to 
craft a product that strengthens all of 
NASA’s 
core 
missions—something 
which benefits not just States with 
strong NASA equities but every Amer-
ican. It is amazing what strong, unified 
leadership can do to bring the Members 
of this body together, working to pass 
vitally important legislation that ad-
vances science and technology and na-
tional security and the interests of our 
Nation. 
I want to say again how grateful I am 
to my colleagues who worked on this 
bill with me and to state just how 
proud I am that the Senate is speaking 
with one, unified voice in passing this 
legislation. This is following a tradi-
tion that we have seen in the past 8 
years I have served in this body, where, 
on the question of space, we have seen 
over and over again strong bipartisan 
cooperation. Even at a time when par-
tisan division pulls us apart in so many 
other areas, on the question of Amer-
ica’s leading the world in space, the 
U.S. Senate speaks with one voice. 
We have a real opportunity here to 
boldly shape the Nation’s space explo-
ration efforts, to inspire new genera-
tions of little boys and little girls gaz-
ing up at the stars and wondering what 
is out there, and to make the United 
States a true space-faring nation. 
While this bill is not going to pass 
the House of Representatives during 
the remainder of this Congress, I look 
forward to the beginning of the next 
Congress, where we can use this unani-
mously approved legislation as the 
starting point to move quickly to pass 
a comprehensive NASA Authorization 
Act across the finish line and get it 
signed into law. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, will the 
Senator from Washington and the Dis-
tinguished Ranking Democrat on the 
Senate Commerce, Science and Trans-
portation Committee yield for a col-
loquy on some issues related to the 
committee’s substitute for S. 2800? 
Ms. CANTWELL. I would be de-
lighted to yield to the senior Senator 
from Maryland and his colleague, Sen-
ator VAN HOLLEN. 
Mr. CARDIN. The Commerce Com-
mittee substitute, as proposed, con-
tains three provisions that are cause 
for concern for my colleague and me. I 
would yield to my colleague from 
Maryland, a distinguished member of 
the Appropriations Subcommittee that 
funds NASA, to outline these concerns. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my col-
league. First, section 702 references 
how NASA should select multi-institu-
tion consortia and university affiliated 
research centers, inserting Congress 
into an agency-specific process that is 
broadly governed by existing authori-
ties in title 5 and title 41 of the U.S. 
Code, which make such selections 
based on technical merit alone and not 
political influence. We are deeply con-
cerned about the committee’s explicit 
delineation of this authority for NASA, 
given that such authority already ex-
ists and NASA currently does not have 
any university affiliated research cen-
ters so designated. We believe that 
such language should never become law 
as it implies that Congress is trying to 
force NASA to establish such a center 
or consortia even though NASA does 
not see the need for one. 
Second, sections 818 and 819 call for 
short order reports from NASA on cre-
ating a Space Resources Institute and 
Center for Space Weather Technology 
that could allow NASA to bypass ex-
tensive consultation with the scientific 
and aerospace communities and with-
out the benefit of independent peer re-
view under the auspices of the National 
Academy of Sciences. 
These are the concerns my colleague 
and I have. 
Mr. CARDIN. Will the Senator from 
Washington confirm that it is not the 
committee’s intention or desire to 
force NASA to establish a university 
affiliated research center or to see ei-
ther sections 818 or section 819 enacted 
without sufficient peer review, to avoid 
even the appearance of a perception 
that any favorable recommendation is 
predesignated for a specific institution 
or set of institutions? 
Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator from 
Maryland is correct. The Commerce 
Committee has no intention of trying 
to pressure NASA to establish a uni-
versity affiliated research center un-
less NASA leadership identifies a tech-
nical need for a mission requirement 
that the agency cannot satisfy through 
the standard competitive processes. In 
addition, the intended results of the re-
ports called for in sections 818 and 819 
should not be viewed as seeking to 
avoid either peer review by the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences or very 
broad consultation with the scientific 
and aerospace communities. 
Mr. CARDIN. I thank the Senator for 
her assurances and ask her, knowing 
that the future of this bill’s fate in this 
Congress is uncertain, if she will agree 
that she will work with my colleague 
from Maryland and me to fix these pro-
visions to our satisfaction early in the 
next Congress before a new NASA au-
thorization bill is introduced? 
Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator has 
my assurance to work to accommodate 
his concerns and those of his colleague 
from Maryland before we proceed on 
any comparable legislation in the 117th 
Congress. 
Mr. CRUZ. Therefore, as if in legisla-
tive session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of Calendar No. 525, 
S. 2800. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2800) to authorize programs of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation, with an amendment to strike 
all after the enacting clause and insert 
in lieu thereof the following:

itation; and

who is in receipt of a decision notice of involun-
tary separation for misconduct or unacceptable 
performance. 
‘‘(2) AUTHORITY.—The Administrator may es-
tablish a program under which employees may 
be eligible for early retirement, offered separa-
tion incentive pay to separate from service vol-
untarily, or both. This authority may be used to 
reduce the number of personnel employed or to 
restructure the workforce to meet mission objec-
tives without reducing the overall number of 
personnel. This authority is in addition to, and 
notwithstanding, any other authorities estab-
lished by law or regulation for such programs. 
‘‘(3) EARLY RETIREMENT.—An employee who is 
at least 50 years of age and has completed 20 
years of service, or has at least 25 years of serv-
ice, may, pursuant to regulations promulgated 
under this subsection, apply and be retired from 
the Administration and receive benefits in ac-
cordance with subchapter III of chapter 83 or 84 
of title 5 if the employee has been employed con-
tinuously within the Administration for more 
than 30 days before the date on which the deter-
mination to conduct a reduction or restruc-
turing within 1 or more Administration centers 
is approved.

ployee would be entitled to receive under section 
5595(c) of title 5, if the employee were entitled to 
payment under such section; or 
‘‘(ii) $40,000. 
‘‘(B) LIMITATIONS.—Separation pay shall not 
be a basis for payment, and shall not be in-
cluded in the computation, of any other type of 
Government benefit. Separation pay shall not be 
taken into account for the purpose of deter-
mining the amount of any severance pay to 
which an individual may be entitled under sec-
tion 5595 of title 5, based on any other separa-
tion. 
‘‘(C) INSTALLMENTS.—Separation pay, if paid 
in installments, shall cease to be paid upon the 
recipient’s acceptance of employment by the 
Federal Government, or commencement of work 
under a personal services contract as described 
in paragraph (5). 
‘‘(5) LIMITATIONS ON REEMPLOYMENT.— 
‘‘(A) An employee who receives separation 
pay under such program may not be reemployed 
by the Administration for a 12-month period be-
ginning on the effective date of the employee’s 
separation, unless this prohibition is waived by 
the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. 
‘‘(B) An employee who receives separation 
pay under this section on the basis of a separa-
tion and accepts employment with the Govern-
ment of the United States, or who commences 
work through a personal services contract with 
the United States within 5 years after the date 
of the separation on which payment of the sepa-
ration pay is based, shall be required to repay 
the entire amount of the separation pay to the 
Administration. If the employment is with an 
Executive agency (as defined by section 105 of 
title 5) other than the Administration, the Ad-
ministrator may, at the request of the head of 
that agency, waive the repayment if the indi-
vidual involved possesses unique abilities and is 
the only qualified applicant available for the 
position. If the employment is within the Ad-
ministration, the Administrator may waive the 
repayment if the individual involved is the only 
qualified applicant available for the position. If 
the employment is with an entity in the legisla-
tive branch, the head of the entity or the ap-
pointing official may waive the repayment if the 
individual involved possesses unique abilities 
and is the only qualified applicant available for 
the position. If the employment is with the judi-
cial branch, the Director of the Administrative 
Office of the United States Courts may waive 
the repayment if the individual involved pos-
sesses unique abilities and is the only qualified 
applicant available for the position. 
‘‘(6) REGULATIONS.—Under the program estab-
lished under paragraph (2), early retirement 
and separation pay may be offered only pursu-
ant to regulations established by the Adminis-
trator, subject to such limitations or conditions 
as the Administrator may require. 
‘‘(7) USE OF EXISTING FUNDS.—The Adminis-
trator shall carry out this subsection using 
amounts otherwise made available to the Ad-
ministrator and no additional funds are author-
ized to be appropriated to carry out this sub-
section.’’.

ployee who is in receipt of a decision notice 
of involuntary separation for misconduct or 
unacceptable performance. 
‘‘(2) AUTHORITY.—The Administrator may 
establish a program under which employees 
may be eligible for early retirement, offered 
separation incentive pay to separate from 
service voluntarily, or both. This authority 
may be used to reduce the number of per-
sonnel employed or to restructure the work-
force to meet mission objectives without re-
ducing the overall number of personnel. This 
authority is in addition to, and notwith-
standing, any other authorities established 
by law or regulation for such programs. 
‘‘(3) EARLY RETIREMENT.—An employee who 
is at least 50 years of age and has completed 
20 years of service, or has at least 25 years of 
service, may, pursuant to regulations pro-
mulgated under this subsection, apply and be 
retired from the Administration and receive 
benefits in accordance with subchapter III of

‘‘(B) LIMITATIONS.—Separation pay shall 
not be a basis for payment, and shall not be 
included in the computation, of any other 
type of Government benefit. Separation pay

pose of determining the amount of any sever-
ance pay to which an individual may be enti-
tled under section 5595 of title 5, based on 
any other separation. 
‘‘(C) INSTALLMENTS.—Separation pay, if

ment by the Federal Government, or com-
mencement of work under a personal serv-
ices contract as described in paragraph (5). 
‘‘(5) LIMITATIONS ON REEMPLOYMENT.— 
‘‘(A) An employee who receives separation 
pay under such program may not be reem-
ployed by the Administration for a 12-month

which payment of the separation pay is 
based, shall be required to repay the entire 
amount of the separation pay to the Admin-
istration. If the employment is with an Exec-
utive agency (as defined by section 105 of 
title 5) other than the Administration, the 
Administrator may, at the request of the 
head of that agency, waive the repayment if 
the individual involved possesses unique 
abilities and is the only qualified applicant 
available for the position. If the employment 
is within the Administration, the Adminis-
trator may waive the repayment if the indi-
vidual involved is the only qualified appli-
cant available for the position. If the em-
ployment is with an entity in the legislative 
branch, the head of the entity or the ap-
pointing official may waive the repayment if 
the individual involved possesses unique 
abilities and is the only qualified applicant 
available for the position. If the employment 
is with the judicial branch, the Director of 
the Administrative Office of the United 
States Courts may waive the repayment if 
the individual involved possesses unique 
abilities and is the only qualified applicant 
available for the position. 
‘‘(6) REGULATIONS.—Under the program es-
tablished under paragraph (2), early retire-
ment and separation pay may be offered only 
pursuant to regulations established by the 
Administrator, subject to such limitations 
or conditions as the Administrator may re-
quire. 
‘‘(7) USE OF EXISTING FUNDS.—The Adminis-
trator shall carry out this subsection using 
amounts otherwise made available to the Ad-
ministrator and no additional funds are au-
thorized to be appropriated to carry out this 
subsection.’’.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4999 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I am 
here on behalf of the millions of work-
ing people in this country who are out 
of time, who are out of luck, and who 
are just about out of hope. I am here on 
behalf of the millions of working peo-
ple who have borne the worst of this 
pandemic, the people who got sent 
home back in March and April and 
May, when other businesses got to stay 
open, and when companies like Amazon 
and Facebook were making billions of 
dollars. These are the workers who lost 
their jobs, the workers who lost their 
pay, the workers who were told: Too 
bad for you. 
These are people who right now are 
missing shifts at work to try to care 
for kids who are distance learning be-
cause of COVID, who are trying to care 
for a relative who may be sick. These 
are the people who are always asked to 
make it work, who are always asked to 
hold it together and, you know what, 
they do. 
These are proud people, the working 
people of our Nation. These are strong 
people. These are the people who have 
rallied to this Nation’s defense in every 
hour of need, in every moment of dan-
ger, who have sent their sons and 
daughters to go fight our wars, who 
have given their time and their talents 
and their treasure at every opportunity 
for this Nation. 
And now they are in need. They are 
the backbone of this Nation, and they 
are in crisis. I am talking about the 8 
million Americans who have fallen into 
poverty since this summer; 12 million 
families—working 
families—who 
are 
now behind on their rent; the 35 per-
cent of working families in America 
who have had to go ask for food assist-
ance in the last couple of months be-
cause of this pandemic. Those are the 
people I am talking about. 
I am talking about people like Susan, 
who is a single mother, a working 
mother, from my State in Northeast 
Missouri, where she lives. She wrote to 
me the other day, and she is trying to 
home school her kids who are home be-
cause of COVID. She doesn’t have 
internet because she is in a rural part 
of 
the 
State. 
She 
doesn’t 
have 
broadband. She is trying to feed her 
family. She is trying to stay up with 
her job, but she has to miss shifts at 
work because she has got kids at home 
whom she is trying to home school and 
supervise. Now she has fallen behind on 
her rent. She told me, and these are 
her words: 
I am not asking for handouts. I am just 
asking for a chance to get back on my feet. 
Earlier this week, a friend of mine 
down in Southeast Missouri, the boot 
heel of Missouri, in a town called 
Charleston, was helping to distribute 
food to families in need. He said that 
there were 30 church groups—30—who 
lined up to come get food for their con-
gregations, and over 60 families—this is 
a small town—there were over 60 fami-
lies who stood in line, and as they were 
loading food into the trunks of people’s 
cars, many of them were crying. 
What these people ask for, what 
these Americans ask for is not for gov-
ernment to solve all their problems. It 
is not for government to give them a 
handout. It is a chance to get back on 
their feet, a chance to provide for 
themselves, a chance to recover when 
they have been asked, again, to sac-
rifice so much. 
That is why the least this body can 
do is to provide direct relief to every 
working American who needs it. That 
is what we did back in March that 
every Senator voted for: $1,200 for 
every working individual, $2,400 for 
working couples, 500 bucks for kids and 
dependents. It is the least that we can 
do. It should be the first thing that we 
could do. 
As these negotiations drag on and on, 
fixated and focused and hung up on 
who knows what issues, let’s start with 
this. Let’s send a message to working 
families that they are first, not last; 
that they are the most important con-
sideration, 
not 
some 
afterthought. 
Let’s send that message today. 
Surely, we can agree that the work-
ing people of this country deserve re-
lief, and if we are going to spend hun-
dreds of billions of dollars on bailing

out this, that, and the other, surely, 
surely, we could start with reasonable, 
modest relief to the working people in 
need in this Nation. 
What I am proposing is what every 
Senator has supported already this 
year. What I am proposing is modest 
compared to the scope of the need. 
What I am proposing will give working 
folks in my State and across this coun-
try a shot—a shot—here before Christ-
mas at getting back up on their feet, 
getting back to work, and getting back 
in a position to be able to provide for 
themselves, these folks who are the 
backbone of this Nation. 
I am here today to ask that this body 
take up and pass this relief measure: 
$1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for couples, 
$500 for kids. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I now ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of my bill at the 
desk; I further ask that the bill be con-
sidered read a third time and passed, 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Reserving the right 
to object, Mr. President. First of all, I 
want to say to my colleague from Mis-
souri that I certainly share and I think 
every Senator in this Chamber shares 
his concern for people who are hurting 
because of this COVID pandemic. Busi-
nesses have closed. People are on un-
employment. 
People 
are 
in 
need 
through no fault of their own. 
This is an act of God, and that is one 
of the reasons why I certainly sup-
ported the CARES Act. That was over 
$2 trillion. In total, this body has 
passed well over $3 trillion, 15 percent 
to 16 percent of last year’s GDP in 
terms of financial relief. 
My comments here are really not di-
rected specifically at the proposal of 
the Senator from Missouri because he 
makes many good points. We do have 
working men and women, we have 
households that—again, through no 
fault of their own—are struggling, and 
we need to provide financial support. I 
think my comments are, in some re-
spect, more general from the stand-
point of how we have done that. 
As I have explained to my colleagues 
in conference, by and large, the initial 
need packages here were a shotgun ap-
proach. We had to move fast. We had to 
do something big. We had to make sure 
that markets wouldn’t seize, that fi-
nancial relief could be sent to people 
very quickly, and so we passed over $3 
trillion in financial relief. I knew it 
would be far from perfect. It was far 
from perfect. 
But now we have had a lot more 
time, and anything we consider for this 
additional package that we are consid-
ering now that is being debated, that is 
being discussed, that is being nego-
tiated, ought to be far more targeted. 
One of the reasons we are currently 
$27.4 trillion in debt, which is about 128 
percent of last year’s GDP—if we do 
this bipartisan deal, another trillion 
dollars, we will be $28.4 trillion in debt 
in the next 3 or 4 months. That is 132 
percent of GDP. 
When I came to the Senate, we were 
a little over $14 trillion and our GDP 
was over $15 trillion, and we were actu-
ally below 100 percent of GDP. 
I know I am using a lot of numbers 
right now, and I am going to use more 
because that is part of the problem. 
One of the reasons we are $27.4 tril-
lion in debt is, we only speak about 
need; we only talk in terms of compas-
sion. We all have compassion. We all 
want to fulfill those needs. We just 
don’t talk in numbers very often. We 
don’t analyze the data. We don’t take a 
look at what we did in the past and see, 
did it work or didn’t it work? What was 
spent well? What was wasted? 
So I didn’t have enough time to do 
charts. It would be a little bit easier. 
But let me go through numbers, and I 
will go through slowly so that people 
can understand at least my perspective 
of why I am so concerned about our Na-
tion’s debt and the fact that we are 
mortgaging our children’s future. I 
think we need to be very careful about 
mortgaging it further when we aren’t 
doing it in a targeted fashion. 
So, again, before the COVID reces-
sion hit, in December 2019, we hit a 
record number of people employed in 
this country. There were 158.8 million 
people employed. That was a record. 
Our economy was humming. Because of 
President 
Trump’s 
administration, 
they put forward a reasonable level of 
regulation and competitive taxes. That 
brought back the entrepreneurial spirit 
that supercharged the economy. We 
were at 3.5 percent unemployment. 
When I took econ, 5 percent was con-
sidered full employment. We were at 3.5 
percent unemployment. 
Then, COVID hit and, by April, we 
had gone from almost 159 million peo-
ple employed in this country to just a 
little over 133 million people, so that 
was a reduction in employment of a lit-
tle more than 25 million people—again, 
from 159 million to 133 million, 25 mil-
lion fewer people employed in this Na-
tion. 
Now, the good news: Even though the 
pandemic is still not over and the vac-
cine is being delivered, and it is being 
administrated—I think the end is in 
sight—we have already gained 16 mil-
lion people employed, so now employ-
ment stands at 149.7 million people; 150 
million people are employed—down 
about 9 million jobs—9 million. 
I want you to keep those numbers in 
mind because they are important. Our 
unemployment rate stands at 6.7 per-
cent. By the way, the number of people 
unemployed, according to the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, which has a little 
bit different calculation, is about 10.7. 
So, in this, somewhere between 9 mil-
lion and 11 million people are currently 
unemployed. 
Now, 
in 
the 
CARES 
Act—again, 
which I supported because we had to 
provide relief—we did provide economic 
impact 
payments, 
which 
Senator 
HAWLEY
wants to just duplicate—no 
changes, no modifications, no further 
targeting. Those economic impact pay-
ments were about $275 billion to 166 
million people. Remember, 25 million 
people lost their jobs, but we sent our 
checks to 166 million people, averaging 
about $1,673 per person. What may be a 
more relevant figure is how many 
households we sent those checks to. We 
sent them out to about 115 million 
households at about $2,400 per house-
hold. 
So, again, $275 billion to 115 million 
households—that was about 4.5 more 
households than the number of jobs 
lost. Today, with only 9 million jobs 
lost, not only—I mean, that is a big 
number, a big number. I am not mini-
mizing that. With 9 million jobs lost, if 
we just repeat it—send out to another 
115 million households—that is 12.6 
times the number of jobs lost. And if 
we double it, it goes from $275 billion 
to $550 billion. That is half a trillion 
dollars. 
I know a trillion doesn’t sound like 
much anymore. It seems like hundreds 
of billions seem more, but now that we 
are dealing in $1 trillion or $2 trillion, 
it is pocket change apparently. 
I think it is important to ask: Well, 
how was that money spent? Did it real-
ly—was it really spent on essentials? 
Was this money really needed? Was 
there any hope, actually, of that 
money being stimulative to our econ-
omy? 
Well, we have one study from the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
They issued it on October 13 of 2020. 
What they did is, since 2013, they have 
been sending out in the internet a na-
tional survey to 1,300 households called 
the Survey of Consumer Expectations, 
and with COVID, they decided to send 
out two special surveys—one in June 
and one in August. 
Here is what those survey results 
said. Of the $2,400 per household in the 
June survey, 18 percent of that $275 bil-
lion was spent on essential items; 8 
percent was spent on nonessential; 3 
percent, on donations, for a total of 29 
percent spent. This is what they call 
the marginal propensity to consume, 29 
percent. Of the other 71 percent, equal-
ly divided, 36 percent of that was saved, 
so our Nation’s savings rate increased, 
and 35 percent went to pay off debt— 
credit card debt. 
They also asked the same question 
about what happened to the unemploy-
ment payments. Very similar results: 
24 percent of those unemployment pay-
ments—the plus-up to $600 per week to 
stay on unemployment benefits—24 
percent was spent on essential con-
sumption, 4 percent on nonessential, 1 
percent on donations for, again, the 
same percent: 29 percent was the mar-
ginal propensity to consume from the 
unemployment payments; 71 percent, 
for savings and for debt repayment. 
They also looked ahead, assuming 
that we are going to do another round

of stimulus checks. This time they 
asked their respondents: How would 
you spend $1,500 if you got a check? 
This time respondents said that they 
would spend about 14 percent on essen-
tial consumption, 7 percent on non-
essential, 3 percent on donations, for a 
total of 24 percent that would be the 
marginal propensity to consume—24 
percent—and 76 percent, again, on sav-
ings and debt repayment. 
So I don’t think you can take a look 
at these direct payments to individuals 
as stimulative. Obviously, 18 to 24 per-
cent was spent on essential items. We 
ought to figure out how to provide that 
money so that people can spend it on 
essentials. Again, that is only 18 to 24 
percent maximum. 
I do want to talk a little bit about 
past stimuli. I personally don’t believe 
they do much to stimulate the econ-
omy. I think the best way to stimulate 
the economy is, again, what this ad-
ministration has done: Lower regula-
tion to a reasonable level—nobody ar-
gues for no regulation; we need a rea-
sonable level—and have a competitive 
tax system. 
I fear, in the next administration, we 
may just repeat the mistakes of the 
Obama-Biden administration, and here 
is the proof of their mistakes. Again, 
remember those employment numbers: 
a record of about 159 million, currently 
150 million people, being employed. 
Well, back during the great recession, 
prior to that, we did have employment 
of about 146 million people in January 
2008. By December 2009, that had 
dropped to 138 million people em-
ployed. But when President Obama 
took office, he had total control of 
Congress—a filibuster-proof majority 
here in the Senate—and, within a 
month, they enacted the American Re-
covery and Reinvestment Act—$787 bil-
lion of proposed spending. In February 
of 2009, there were 141.6 million Ameri-
cans working—141.6—and the unem-
ployment rate was 8.3 percent. Again, 
it continued to dip to December 2009 
when it got down to 138 million. It took 
us 3 years from February 2009 to get 
back to 141.6 million Americans work-
ing, and that is with an $800 billion— 
roughly, $800 billion—stimulus package 
that did not work, but it further mort-
gaged our children’s future by another 
$800 billion. 
I wish these things worked. A quick 
aside: Part of that American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act—again, Demo-
crats had total control, with a fili-
buster-proof majority in the Senate. 
Do you know how much they plussed- 
up State unemployment benefits to 
help the unemployed, those 8.3 percent 
of Americans? They plussed it up by a 
whopping $25 per week, and now they 
are arguing that $300 per week, which I 
believe is the current proposal, isn’t 
enough. It kind of makes you wonder, 
doesn’t it? 
So, in summary, kind of reviewing 
these numbers, we currently are at 6.7 
percent unemployment. I don’t recall 
ever, in U.S. history, when we have 
even begun to think that we should 
even spend $100 billion to stimulate an 
economy at 6.7 percent unemployment. 
But this is different. We have under-
employed; we have families in need. 
There is no doubt about it. I com-
pletely support some kind of program 
targeted for small businesses so they 
can reemploy and so they can reopen to 
restore capital. Their life savings have 
been wiped out. I have proposals. They 
have been ignored. 
So what I fear we are going to do 
with this bipartisan package and what 
the Senator from Missouri is talking 
about is the same thing—a shotgun ap-
proach. We will not have learned the 
lessons from our very hurried, very 
rushed, very massive earlier relief 
packages. We will just do more of the 
same—another trillion dollars. It takes 
our debt from $27.4 trillion to $28.4 tril-
lion in a couple of months with doing 
virtually no revisions, no improve-
ments and, similar to what the Senator 
from Missouri is talking about in 
terms of these economic impact pay-
ments, no revisions at all—just spend 
another $275 billion and send it out to 
115 million households when we are 
currently at about 9 million fewer jobs 
than we were in a record economy be-
fore the COVID recession. 
So, for all those reasons, I not only 
object to what Senator HAWLEY is pro-
posing here, but I am certainly lodging 
my objection to what is barreling 
through—the train has left the sta-
tion—on the package being negotiated 
right now that is way too big, that au-
thorizes more money, even though we 
have 
$600 
billion 
there 
just 
for 
repurposing, no new authorization re-
quired. There are 52 Republicans who 
supported it, but that is not good 
enough. We have to throw another $300 
to $400 billion on top, which is $300 to 
$400 billion more that we are mort-
gaging our children’s future without 
reforms and without targeting. So I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator from Wisconsin for his per-
spective, which I always appreciate, 
and, of course, I appreciate working 
with Senator JOHNSON on some of the 
issues. 
On this issue, I am afraid we are just 
going to have to differ, and I just want 
to say this: Nothing could be more tar-
geted and no relief could be more im-
portant than relief for working people. 
The Senator is right; this body has 
spent trillions of dollars this year 
alone on COVID relief. We are getting 
ready to spend, apparently, another 
trillion dollars more. Yet working peo-
ple are told they may be last—if they 
get relief at all. 
I don’t think the American people 
understand that. I know people in Mis-
souri don’t understand it, and I would 
just urge Members of this body: Go 
home and try explaining that to the 
people of your State. Go ahead. Just 
try it. Try telling them why this body 
can bail out the banks. We bailed out 
the banks to such a tune that now they 
have money left over. Now we are 
going to take money back because we 
spent so much on Wall Street and the 
banks in the first part of this year. 
That is right. 
In fact, now I understand that my 
Democratic colleagues don’t want to 
shut down all of the bank money. Who 
knows what we might be able to do 
with that in the future? Oh, they are 
fine. They are more than fine. They are 
doing great. Now Wall Street is doing 
great. Big tech, they are doing great; 
the big multinational corporations, 
fantastic. 
Working 
people—working 
people are living in their cars. Working 
people can’t go to the doctor. Working 
people can’t pay their rent. Working 
people can’t feed their children. They 
should be first, not last. 
And it is no answer for this body to 
tell them: Go get in an unemployment 
line. Really? That is the response? Go 
get in an unemployment line. 
No, the working people of this coun-
try, frankly, deserve better. They de-
serve to be the top priority just like 
they have made this country the top 
priority in their lives and their fami-
lies. 
This is not the end of this fight. I am 
here right now on this floor. Senator 
SANDERS will be back in a matter of 
hours to ask again for the same meas-
ure. Again, I have been proud to part-
ner with him on this effort, and I will 
keep working with whomever it takes 
for however long it takes until we get 
the working people of this country re-
lief. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KEN-
NEDY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4605 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, 3 days 
ago, I came to the floor and spoke in 
honor of the life of Tyler Herndon, a 
Mount Holly, NC, police officer who 
lost his life just days before his 26th 
birthday last week. He was laid to rest 
this week. 
Now 5 days after his murder and 3 
days after my remarks, I am dev-
astated to report that another officer 
in North Carolina has lost his life in 
the line of duty. Wednesday night, the 
Concord Police Department received a 
call about a crashed, abandoned car on 
I–85 just outside of Charlotte. Respond-
ing officers were alerted that the sus-
pect had attempted to steal a woman’s 
car while she was still in it. 
Officers Jason Shuping and Kaleb 
Robinson tracked and identified the 
suspect on foot. As they approached 
the suspect, he pulled out a handgun,

and he shot both of these brave offi-
cers. Tragically, Officer Shuping died 
at the scene. Thankfully, Officer Rob-
inson is recovering at the hospital. Of-
ficer Shuping was just 25 years old—the 
same age as the officer we memorial-
ized this week, Tyler Herndon. 
I am just devastated by this. These 
brave officers had begun their careers 
in law enforcement and had nowhere to 
go but up. They were serving our com-
munity, and they were doing it with 
honor. 
We talk a lot about the sacrifice 
given by law enforcement officers who 
day in and day out are serving our 
communities and putting themselves in 
harm’s way, and it is dispiriting to 
think that these fallen officers, at the 
very beginning of their careers, have 
already made the ultimate sacrifice in 
the name of public safety and commu-
nity safety. 
Families in North Carolina and in 
each of our States are about to endure 
their first Christmas without their 
loved ones. We owe so much to these 
families whose parents, spouses, sib-
lings, children, and grandchildren have 
given everything in the line of duty. 
On Tuesday, when I spoke on Officer 
Herndon, I said that in the next Con-
gress, I would be moving forward with 
the Protect and Serve Act again. This 
act increases penalties for people who 
murder or assault police officers. But 
in light of another police officer’s 
death—the second one in a week in 
North Carolina, in the suburbs, just 
around the corner from where I live, 10 
or 15 minutes away—I think we have to 
elevate the discussion now and send a 
very clear message to those who would 
harm police officers that if you do, 
then there are going to be dire con-
sequences to pay for it. We owe it to 
the police officers to let them know 
that Congress cares about them. We 
should send this message. 
This is a simple bill. It only focuses 
on those who are so brazen that they 
would murder a police officer in the 
line of duty, assault them, ambush 
them—all the things you have seen; 
now 48 murders in this year alone. 
The best thing we can do is to pass 
this commonsense legislation and send 
a message to these people who are tak-
ing away the men and women serving 
our communities. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Judiciary Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 4605 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; further, that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, the Protect and 
Serving Act of 2020 that has been of-
fered by my colleague and friend Sen-
ator TILLIS
creates a new Federal 
crime that would punish assaults on 
law enforcement officers, including 
State and local officers, by up to 10 
years and up to life if death results 
from the offense or the offense involves 
kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, or 
attempt to kill. 
Let me say at the outset that I had a 
few seconds to communicate with my 
colleague before this official colloquy 
on the floor. 
I say to the Senator, I sensed in your 
voice and what you told me how per-
sonal this is to you. This just isn’t the 
killing of a law enforcement officer, 
which is a tragedy all of itself. It is 
your neighborhood. It is your commu-
nity. As you said, some of these offi-
cers, you know their families, and it is 
very personal. 
I want to say first, I offer my condo-
lences to the families and colleagues of 
Officer Jason Shuping, who lost his life 
in Concord, NC, and Officer Tyler 
Avery Herndon, who lost his life in 
Mount Holly in the line of duty in 
North Carolina in the last few weeks. 
These are terrible tragedies. 
We had a similar situation, of all 
places, in the Loop in Chicago just a 
couple of years ago—Commander Paul 
Bauer. What a spectacular man he was 
in service to the city of Chicago and 
the State of Illinois. He was murdered 
in the Loop. Unfortunately, his poor 
young family had to go through the or-
deal not only of the funeral but also, 
then, of the trial of the suspect. I raise 
that only because Paul Bauer’s assail-
ant was successfully prosecuted by the 
State of Illinois and was given a life 
sentence just recently. 
As is the case in most of these situa-
tions, to my knowledge, I would say to 
the Senator from North Carolina, every 
State, including his own, takes this 
very seriously and prosecutes cases of 
harm involving law enforcement offi-
cers. 
The individual responsible for shoot-
ing Officer Shuping is dead. If he had 
lived, he would have been prosecuted 
for a capital offense in North Carolina. 
The individual who allegedly shot Offi-
cer Herndon has been indicted for first- 
degree murder in North Carolina. 
So it raises the question, why is it 
necessary to create a Federal crime for 
something already being successfully 
prosecuted in every State in the Na-
tion? Assaults on police officers are al-
ready criminalized with enhanced pen-
alties, as they should be, and assaults 
on Federal officers are already Federal 
offenses. I have a lengthy list here, 
which I will not read to you, of all of 
the Federal statutes that already pro-
vide for punishment up to death and a 
life sentence for those Federal officers 
who would be shot or harmed in any 
way. 
So let me say this to my friend and 
colleague from North Carolina: I thank 
you for standing up on the floor and 
bringing this matter to our attention. 
We should never overlook the fact that 
these men and women serve us self-
lessly and risk their lives in the proc-
ess. It has happened here in the Cap-
itol. It happens in every corner of 
America, sadly. But let’s save this for 
another day. Let’s take this up in the 
new Congress, which is about to start 
in just a few days. Let’s address this 
issue, as well as the issue of how to 
make the plight of our law enforce-
ment officers safer and more effective. 
To deal with issues involving that, I 
think, would be a balanced approach to 
this, which would serve justice. 
For those reasons, I will object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I am ob-
viously disappointed in the objection 
from my friend and colleague from Illi-
nois, but I do believe that we have to 
start recognizing that something bad is 
happening—48 murders, hundreds of as-
saults, 
ambushes, 
premeditated 
at-
tacks. 
I do understand the idea that maybe 
you could prosecute it through existing 
law, your Federal or State law, but we 
have an epidemic of ‘‘abolish the po-
lice, defund the police,’’ marginalizing 
the police, that suggests to me that 
even if there are pathways now to prop-
erly prosecute these brazen criminals, 
we have to cut through some of the 
rhetoric that, honestly, I believe is the 
responsibility for some of these unprec-
edented numbers of murders and as-
saults. 
So although I am disappointed with 
the objection today, I look forward to 
working with my colleague on the Ju-
diciary and others to do everything we 
can to pass the Protect and Serve Act 
and to send a very clear message to 
these increasingly less safe commu-
nities and more threatened law en-
forcement officers that we are going to 
do everything we can to make our com-
munities safe and to make a police offi-
cer’s job as safe as it can be. 
Thank you. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, there is 
a lot going on and not enough of some 
things we really need to go on going 
on. 
But I think it is worth noting again— 
lest the moment be lost somehow in all 
the back and forth and all the chaos— 
that we have reached a watershed mo-
ment in the war against COVID–19. 
As you know, the first successful vac-
cine was approved last week. I watched 
online as the Vice President of the 
United States and his wife received the 
vaccine. I applaud them for dem-
onstrating 
their 
confidence, 
which 
should be all of our confidence, that 
this vaccine is not only effective but 
also safe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7686 
December 18, 2020 
In my State of Texas, it is estimated 
that there will be a million people vac-
cinated by the end of this month. That 
is a modern medical and logistical mir-
acle. 
Yesterday—the news keeps getting 
better—the 
FDA’s 
expert 
advisory 
panel recommended the Agency ap-
prove a second successful vaccine, 
meaning millions more doses, over and 
above the Pfizer vaccine, could be 
headed out the door in a matter of 
days, if not hours. 
The light at the end of the tunnel is 
getting bigger and brighter every day, 
but we are not out of the dark yet. As 
we know, tragically, more than 300,000 
Americans have lost their lives to this 
virus. Millions have lost their jobs and 
their livelihood. Countless small busi-
nesses have permanently closed their 
doors, and the devastating impact of 
the virus across the country is growing 
day by day. 
Earlier this year, we were able to 
come together in four separate pieces 
of legislation in a bipartisan—nearly 
unanimous—manner and respond with 
the sort of alacrity and speed and with 
the scope that I think our constituents 
expected us to. We didn’t exactly know 
how big we needed to go. We just knew 
we needed to go big and we needed to 
go fast. 
We appropriated more than $3 trillion 
of coronavirus relief. We didn’t know 
how long the virus was going to last. 
And when we tried to offer additional 
aid to the American people, unfortu-
nately, the partisan dysfunction that 
sometimes creeps in—particularly, in 
the days leading up to a national elec-
tion—prevented us from providing that 
relief. 
But the election is over, and it is 
time for us to do our jobs. Really, we 
need to build on our past success. 
The bills culminating in the CARES 
Act in March bolstered our healthcare 
response by making testing free of 
charge. Remember that used to be the 
watchword, what people would con-
tinue to say day after day after day: 
testing, testing, testing. You are not 
hearing that anymore because testing 
is ubiquitous. 
We provided vital funding for hos-
pitals and armed our medical workers 
with the personal protective equipment 
they needed to sustain this fight on the 
frontline. We poured funding into re-
search and development of vaccines, 
therapeutics, and treatment. And by 
any measure, those efforts have been a 
success. 
While, as I said, the number of people 
testing positive has gone up pretty dra-
matically, the death rate has remained 
much lower than it was in the early 
days of the virus. That is because, I be-
lieve, the treatments have improved, 
the therapeutics are working, and our 
healthcare providers are learning how 
to treat people with the virus in ways 
that are saving lives. 
The work we did up through March 
buoyed the workers and families who 
needed the help with direct payments, 
bolstered 
unemployment 
insurance 
benefits, and even gave the option to 
defer student loan payments with no 
penalty. We knew people needed help, 
and we acted responsibly, I believe. 
We also supported our wobbly econ-
omy with the assistance for the Main 
Street businesses through the Pay-
check Protection Program and loans 
for the industries that our States and 
Country rely on. 
But as time has gone on, much of the 
funding provided by those bills has run 
out. As I said, we didn’t know in March 
how long this was going to last, either 
the public health challenges or the eco-
nomic challenges associated with it. 
But we have a better picture of what is 
needed now and we need to act and act 
soon—money for schools, vaccine dis-
tribution, 
and 
for 
airlines, 
which, 
through no fault of their own, are see-
ing their ridership plummet. They need 
help. Each of these are worthy of our 
best efforts to help. 
Critical provisions that supported ev-
erything from unemployment benefits 
to the Paycheck Protection Program 
have already lapsed or are within just 
a few days of doing so. I know people 
wonder: Why does Congress wait so 
long, to the 11th hour to act? 
Well, call it human nature, call it 
stubbornness, call it politics, call it 
what you will, but deadlines do force 
action, especially here in the Congress. 
I believe we are on the cusp of positive 
results for the American people. 
For months now, disagreements on 
what the next relief bill should look 
like have stopped us from making 
progress. Unfortunately, I think it was 
more about the election and stoking 
the fears and anxieties of the American 
electorate in the run up to the elec-
tion. I think that is what prevented us 
from passing additional bills after the 
CARES Act in March. 
Then NANCY PELOSI and the House 
passed the Heroes Act, which every-
body 
recognized—the 
mainstream 
media and even Democrats acknowl-
edged—was not going to go anywhere. 
That was another $3 trillion bill that 
helped the nascent marijuana industry, 
providing tax cuts to the wealthy peo-
ple living in high-tax jurisdictions like 
New York and San Francisco. It was 
clearly not designed to pass, but rather 
to send a message. 
Well, we knew we needed a targeted 
bill to send relief to those who needed 
it most, without driving up govern-
ment spending even higher than nec-
essary. Over these last several months, 
too much of the discussion has been fo-
cused on the areas where we disagree 
and, truthfully, there is no such thing 
as a perfect bill. You can always find a 
reason to say no. 
But I don’t believe that is the reason 
our constituents have sent us here. 
They want us to be responsible. They 
want us to be careful with their tax 
dollars, but they do want us to act in 
their best interests by trying to find 
ways to build consensus—even when we 
can’t agree on everything, to at least 
agree on the things we agree on. I 
think they expect us to do that. 
We all understand that our workers 
and many people have had the rug 
pulled out from under them. They had 
no money coming in the front door. 
They are worried about paying the rent 
or mortgage. Their kids are at home 
going through virtual schooling. I 
mean, it is tough on a lot of people. It 
is not so tough if you are a Member of 
Congress and are receiving a paycheck. 
But for millions of our constituents 
back home, they have been waiting and 
waiting, and they have been hurting 
because we have not been able to get 
our act together. 
The second round of the job-saving 
Paycheck Protection Program would 
help a lot. It would help our small busi-
nesses, throw them another lifeline. 
That was really one of the most pop-
ular parts of what we were able to do in 
March. 
As the Presiding Officer will remem-
ber, we appropriated $350 billion and it 
went in 2 weeks. So we appropriated 
another $320 billion to provide loans to 
small businesses and incentives for 
them to maintain their payroll so peo-
ple would have income and so that 
those small businesses, once we got the 
virus in the rearview mirror, would 
still be around and help rebound our 
economy. 
In Texas alone, there were 417,000 
Paycheck Protection loans—$41 billion 
worth. The average loan was $115,000; 
although, I was on a Zoom call with 
some in the Texas Bankers Associa-
tion, and one of them told me that 
their smallest loan was $300. I am sure 
there is an interesting story behind 
that. The point is this was needed help, 
and it has run out. 
Then we need another investment in 
vaccine distribution. The logistical 
challenge 
of 
getting 
this 
vaccine 
around the country is mind-boggling, 
but we can see it is already working be-
cause of thorough planning and good 
execution, but they need more money 
to make sure that we get the job done. 
We also need to make sure that 
schools, particularly as people feel 
more comfortable going back to school 
in person, get additional support so 
they can bring the children back into 
the classrooms and keep them and the 
teachers and other employees healthy 
at the schools. 
We know virtual learning has been a 
disaster, particularly for low-income 
students. Unfortunately, broadband is 
not universally available in the United 
States, and there are parts of my State 
wherein as many as a third of the stu-
dents don’t have access to broadband. 
So how in the world are they going to 
continue their educations? Local offi-
cials and State officials have tried to 
help, leaving parking lots outside of 
the school libraries available so you 
can drive up and gain access to the Wi- 
Fi from the schools, or they have dis-
tributed hotspots so that, if you get ac-
cess to cellular service, you can actu-
ally tie into Wi-Fi and get online and

continue your studies. Yet, for many of 
our 
young 
people, 
these 
school 
lockdowns have been a disaster in 
terms of their educations. So we need 
to do more in that area as well. 
Common sense tells us that, when 
you are sitting across the table, negoti-
ating with somebody, if 80 percent of 
what you are talking about is agreed 
to, the process should move along pret-
ty quickly because nobody gets 100 per-
cent of what one wants around here. It 
is just not possible. While it is unfortu-
nate it has taken us so long to reach 
this point, I am encouraged that 
maybe, just maybe—now with the 
deadline for government funding run-
ning out tonight at 12 midnight—this 
is forcing action and that a deal is in 
sight. 
There has been more bipartisan co-
operation and communication over the 
last several days than there has been in 
the last several months. A lot of people 
have put a lot of effort into this on a 
bipartisan basis, and now the decision 
is with what we call the ‘‘four cor-
ners’’—rank-and-file Members of the 
House and Senate. We are not going to 
have a chance to amend this deal. It is 
going to be proposed by Speaker 
PELOSI, Democratic Leader SCHUMER, 
Leader MCCARTHY, Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL, and the White House. So I 
am sure it is not going to be perfect. 
Unfortunately, we will not have a 
chance to make it better. I hope the 
partisan divisions that have paralyzed 
Congress for much of the year do not 
rear their ugly heads in these final 
hours and at this critical stage of nego-
tiation. 
There is too much at stake for us to 
go home for the holidays emptyhanded. 
There are too many people who are 
hurting, too many people who are anx-
ious. The number of people having 
overdosed by self-medicating since the 
virus hit is, I think, about 80,000, I 
read. You can imagine people self- 
medicating, whether it is with alcohol 
or drugs or people who are trapped 
with an abuser, either a spousal abuser 
or a child abuser. Because they are not 
going to school, their teachers can’t 
look for signs of that abuse and get 
them help. Reports of child sexual 
abuse are down 40 percent. It is not be-
cause it is not happening; it is because 
kids aren’t in school, where teachers 
and others can come to their aid. 
I can only imagine a single mom, 
say, with three kids of different ages at 
home, trying to continue their edu-
cations, but she is worried: How do I 
keep working—maybe she is an essen-
tial worker—so she can pay the bills to 
put food on the table and pay the rent. 
Can you imagine the chaos and stress? 
There is too much at stake for us to 
go home for the holidays emptyhanded. 
We need to remember we are not here 
for our benefit; we are here for the ben-
efit of the people we are honored to 
represent—in my case, 29 million Tex-
ans. We have a fiduciary responsibility. 
We are in a position of trust. They 
have entrusted us with their welfare. 
The American people have waited long 
enough. We can’t let them down again. 
We are on the 5-yard line, and we need 
to deliver. We need to get this done and 
get this done soon. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 8428 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we had a 
hearing this week, the Immigration 
Subcommittee of Senate Judiciary, 
and Senator BLUMENTHAL
was there 
with me and others. We listened to peo-
ple from Hong Kong tell the story of 
what is happening because of the re-
pressive regime in Beijing and what is 
happening to those in Hong Kong who 
are demonstrating in favor of democ-
racy. 
This hearing on the crisis in Hong 
Kong also raised a lot of questions 
about the United States and our own 
immigration and refugee policy toward 
those who are being persecuted. 
At the hearing, there was some pow-
erful testimony. I recall one of the wit-
nesses, Mr. Chu, who said that he was 
aware of students—Chinese students— 
currently in the United States who 
have already been designated as en-
emies of the state by China and who, if 
they are forced to return to China, will 
face prosecution, imprisonment, and 
who knows. It was a very personal 
story because these people are friends 
of his who, through no fault of their 
own, only speaking out against the re-
gime in Beijing, now will face long 
prison sentences if forced to return to 
China. 
I am amazed, as I meet these people 
from China and Hong Kong, at the 
courage they show. Mr. Chu, for exam-
ple, had come to the United States— 
been sent to the United States by his 
father at the age of 12 because his fa-
ther had made a practice of helping the 
Chinese who had demonstrated on 
Tiananmen Square and providing the 
equivalent of an underground railroad 
for them to escape China. I guess the 
people in Beijing were on his heels, and 
so to protect his family, he sent his 12- 
year-old son to the United States, who 
has lived here for a number of years. 
He is an American citizen now. 
This repression and the Chinese Gov-
ernment meddling in the lives of the 
people of Hong Kong are appalling. 
Thousands of protestors in Hong Kong 
have been persecuted for fighting for 
the liberties that we Americans rou-
tinely say we enjoy—freedoms of as-
sembly and speech, the right to vote, 
due process, and the rule of law. 
The national security law imposed on 
Hong Kong by the Chinese Communist 
Party in June has enabled the ruthless 
abuse of protesters, political leaders, 
journalists, and teachers. Despite its 
name, the national security law is not 
about security; it is about fear—fear of 
the voices in Hong Kong calling for re-
form of democracy and freedom. 
I believe my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle share my feelings about the 
crisis in Hong Kong, but the question 
today is, What are we willing to do 
about it? 
Last week, on a unanimous voice 
vote, the House of Representatives 
passed the bipartisan Hong Kong Peo-
ple’s Freedom and Choice Act, which 
would grant temporary protected sta-
tus to Hong Kong residents currently 
in the United States and provide an op-
portunity 
for 
refugee 
status 
to 
Hongkongers facing persecution. 
At Wednesday’s Judiciary Committee 
hearing, we received a clear message: 
Congress needs to pass the Hong Kong 
People’s Freedom and Choice Act in 
the Senate now. We can do it. In fact, 
we can do it today. Think about the 
message it would send from the United 
States to Hong Kong and to the world 
if we sent this bill to the President’s 
desk to be signed into law. It is bipar-
tisan. It was unanimous in the House. 
It is timely, and it addresses a real 
problem. 
Under the bill, Hong Kong would be 
designated for TPS for 18 months. To 
qualify 
for 
TPS 
status, 
eligible 
Hongkongers currently in the United 
States would need to first clear a 
criminal history and national security 
screening and pay a $360 filing fee. 
Some of the critics have said: We 
can’t trust the Chinese in the United 
States. They may be spies. 
That is why we require, under the 
TPS, that anyone applying for this 
TPS status has to go through a crimi-
nal background check and a national 
security screening. 
I want America to be safe—we all 
do—but just to categorically say ‘‘If 
you are from China or from Hong Kong, 
you are a suspicious character, and we 
don’t want you to stay here’’ isn’t fair. 
It isn’t realistic. 
Sixty-seven hundred students are 
here now legally in the United States 
from Hong Kong and China, and they 
were admitted to the United States 
under standards and investigations. 
They are students at our universities, 
and they would qualify for this impor-
tant temporary humanitarian protec-
tion so that they aren’t forced to re-
turn to a literally dangerous situation. 
TPS can be granted by the President 
if he wishes, but the Trump adminis-
tration 
has 
failed 
to 
protect 
Hongkongers in need. 
This bill also establishes expedited 
refugee and asylum access for qualified 
individuals and their family members. 
This 
would 
enable 
persecuted 
Hongkongers to register with any U.S. 
Embassy or Consulate, or with the De-
partment of Homeland Security if they 
are in the United States. 
Refugees and asylees would be re-
quired to meet all legal requirements 
and pass background checks before

December 18, 2020 
being granted status in the United 
States. That is just not a minor admin-
istrative chore. We are serious about 
it. If you want to come to the United 
States as a refugee or asylee, we will 
do everything we can to make certain 
that you are no danger to anyone in 
the United States. 
The refugee policies of this outgoing 
administration 
have 
put 
at 
risk 
Hongkongers who are fleeing Chinese 
persecution, not to mention millions of 
other vulnerable refugees. Since the 
enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, 
the United States has resettled on av-
erage of 80,000 refugees a year. That is 
our annual average since 1980. How-
ever, in the midst of the worst refugee 
crisis in history, the current Trump ad-
ministration has set record low refugee 
admissions figures for 4 years in a row, 
culminating in the lowest levels in his-
tory this year at 15,000—from 80,000 to 
15,000. 
How many refugees has the United 
States admitted from Hong Kong in the 
last year? Zero—not one. 
When you look at what the Com-
munist Chinese Party is doing in 
China, threatening these demonstra-
tors who are marching in the streets 
for things that we say over and over 
are the underpinnings of our democ-
racy, and to think that we have not 
granted one single person in Hong 
Kong refugee status is hard to imagine. 
The Trump administration has deci-
mated 
legal 
protections 
for 
Hongkongers and other innocent vic-
tims of persecution. 
For example, under the rule issued 
last week, Hongkongers could be de-
nied asylum if they transit other coun-
tries on the way to the United States, 
if persecutors detain them for only a 
brief period, or if persecutors were not 
able to carry out their threats before 
the activist fled. 
According to the testimony of the 
Hong Kong Democracy Council execu-
tive director, Samuel Chu, on Wednes-
day—I mentioned him earlier—the peo-
ple most immediately at risk in Hong 
Kong are the approximately 10,000 indi-
viduals who have been arrested by the 
Chinese Government crackdown. 
Make no mistake. We know what the 
Chinese Communist Party is up to. As 
for these concentration camps—they 
call 
them 
reeducation 
camps—that 
they created for the Uyghurs, we know 
what they are doing. They characterize 
them in many different ways, but we 
have seen this throughout history. The 
question is, What are we going to do 
about it? 
We are going to protest what is hap-
pening to the people in Hong Kong, but 
will we take one step—even one small 
step—to provide them security and 
safety? 
Not all of them are going to wish to 
leave Hong Kong, I understand that. 
Some of them can’t. Some of them may 
receive assistance from another coun-
try. The British Prime Minister has of-
fered a path to citizenship to up to 3 
million Hongkongers eligible for over-
seas passports. The Australian Govern-
ment has stepped in with visa options 
for students and workers from Hong 
Kong. Canada announced multiple new 
immigration 
measures 
supporting 
Hong Kong residents, including meas-
ures to help Hong Kong students in 
Canada. 
I have a basic question. What are we 
going to do? You hear this about the 
British stepping up, the Australians 
stepping up, the Canadians stepping up. 
Where is the United States? 
This is our chance today. Senator 
BLUMENTHAL is going to make a unani-
mous consent request to actually have 
the United States do something. 
One country cannot take in all the 
refugees from Hong Kong nor should it 
be expected to, but surely the United 
States of America, the most powerful 
nation on the Earth and, we hope, a 
model for democracy in the world, can-
not protest what is happening to the 
innocent people of Hong Kong and the 
repressive regime of Beijing and then 
do nothing. 
Passing the Hong Kong People’s 
Freedom and Choice Act is urgently 
needed. The situation continues to de-
teriorate. We need to do it and do it 
quickly. 
We 
need 
to 
protect 
Hongkongers in need. Think about the 
message that it sends to the world if 
the United States agrees with Senator 
BLUMENTHAL’s 
request 
today 
and 
passes the measure that has already 
passed the House of Representatives 
and it becomes the law of the land. 
How will the Chinese Government pass 
that off as insignificant, when all of 
these countries are basically saying 
their treatment of the people of Hong 
Kong is abominable? 
We should act quickly. The Senate 
Judiciary Committee has failed to 
raise another bill, the Hong Kong Safe 
Harbor Act, sent to it 6 months ago. So 
they have had their opportunity in the 
committee to do something. Under the 
Democratic majority, the House did 
their job and acted quickly with a bi-
partisan bill. 
We have seen a lot of speeches on 
both sides of the aisle about how mad 
we are at the Chinese Government. The 
question today, in the next few min-
utes, is, Are we mad enough to do 
something? 
Do something significant. I ask the 
Senate to join the House in passing the 
Hong 
Kong 
People’s 
Freedom 
and 
Choice Act now. Let’s send this bill to 
the President and send a strong mes-
sage to the people of Hong Kong that 
they are not in this alone. 
How fortunate I am to have a col-
league like Dick Blumenthal. We see 
eye-to-eye on this issue. He jumped on 
the measure and said he wanted to 
move on it, and I thought, darn, I wish 
I would have been the first one, but I 
am happy to accompany him on this ef-
fort. 
I sincerely hope that this is truly bi-
partisan. If our protest against the 
Communist Party of China is meaning-
ful and bipartisan, it will be powerful. 
I yield to my colleague, Senator 
BLUMENTHAL. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am really honored to follow Senator 
DURBIN, a staunch and steadfast cham-
pion of refugees and immigration re-
form who, year after year, has shown 
the courage to stand up on this issue. 
And to emphasize a point that he has 
made, there is an urgency to our act-
ing. There is a sense that time is not 
on our side for the lives at stake here. 
The world has watched in horror as 
China has cracked down on the incip-
ient democracy movement in Hong 
Kong. We have seen the yellow umbrel-
las. We have seen the marchers in the 
streets and the brutality and the cru-
elty of the Chinese Communist Party 
and Chinese authorities, using clubs 
and guns with the kind of thuggishness 
that has come to characterize the Chi-
nese anti-democracy movement there 
and around the world. We have an op-
portunity to take a stand and speak 
out and do something in defense of the 
brave protesters who are risking their 
lives. 
We have seen this kind of democracy 
movement before. We know it is in the 
great tradition of our country to stand 
with those protestors and those march-
ers who are saying to the Chinese Gov-
ernment: We will not let you break the 
agreement that you did in 1984 with the 
United Kingdom to preserve these free-
doms and to make Hong Kong an out-
post of democracy in the repressive re-
gime of China. We will not let you chip 
away at our rights or extradite our 
people to China. That law was the 
spark that ignited these protests. We 
will not let you mock our demand for 
freedom and democracy. 
The Hong Kong People’s Freedom 
and Choice Act of 2020 was passed 
unanimously in the House of Rep-
resentatives with overwhelming bipar-
tisan support, and it would very simply 
give those protesters protective status 
in this country, the greatest Nation in 
the history of the world, saying to 
them: We will give you a safe harbor. 
We will give you a place where you can 
be protected. 
And remember, what the Chinese are 
saying is: You can be indicted. You can 
be arrested. No matter where you are 
in the world, if you violated our law, 
we will bring you back. 
And we would say to those protestors 
who are simply demanding funda-
mental freedoms that often we take for 
granted here: We will give you protec-
tive status. We will give you temporary 
protective status right away. We will 
make sure that you have that safe har-
bor. 
Now, I know that my colleagues, 
Senators Rubio and Menendez, have a 
bill that is actually called the Hong 
Kong Safe Harbor Act. We had a hear-
ing on it the other day in the Judiciary 
Committee. All of my colleagues ex-
pressed support for the individuals who 
came to us asking us to act on that 
measure.

S7689 
December 18, 2020 
The Hong Kong People’s Freedom 
and Choice Act of 2020, in fact, would 
go beyond that measure, only to say 
that you don’t have to be formally 
charged in China and you don’t have to 
be in specific categories of protestor. 
You can be a journalist, and you can 
get temporary protective status. It 
would also say that you don’t have to 
demonstrate individually a fear of per-
secution, but you do have to be 
screened. You do have to demonstrate 
that you are not going to be a national 
security threat. 
My colleague Senator DURBIN is abso-
lutely right to make this point. No-
body wants Chinese spies in this coun-
try. There would be a background 
check and a screening just as there are 
for other refugees under this measure. 
The other day, at this hearing, we 
heard from Samuel Chu and Nathan 
Lau and we heard from Joey Su. These 
activists are fighting for their freedom. 
We heard their stories, so powerful and 
moving. Their faces and voices should 
be heard and heeded in this body. 
We are far removed here in this se-
date setting from the clamor and the 
cruelty of those streets in Hong Kong, 
where men and women have stood 
bravely against the physical brutality 
and force of the Chinese regime. But we 
should send a message to the world: We 
are going to stand with those refugees 
who come here heeding the lady who 
stands in New York Harbor with a mes-
sage of hope and freedom. The same 
lady who many of our forebears in this 
Chamber saw when they came to this 
country—like my dad, in 1935, at the 
age of 17, alone, seeking to escape per-
secution in Germany, speaking no 
English, knowing virtually no one, 
having not much more than the shirt 
on his back but believing—believing— 
that America would offer him the safe-
ty of freedom as a refugee. 
That is our tradition in this country. 
It goes beyond party, geography, race, 
or religion. It is what makes America 
truly great. We are a nation of immi-
grants and refugees, and my hope is, as 
I stand here, that we will have the 
same unanimity in this body as the 
House did, despite all the other divi-
sions that persist at this point; that we 
will have the respect for the moral im-
perative to act now and make sure that 
we fulfill the message of America now 
that is more important than ever be-
fore in light of the repressive regimes, 
even in our own region, whether it is 
Venezuela, Guatemala, Honduras, Nica-
ragua, where we can say to the world: 
We are going to stand by our prin-
ciples, and we are going to do it now 
because of the urgency of this moment 
and the need of these refugees for tem-
porary protective status. 
Let us act now. 
So, Mr. President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Judiciary Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 8428, 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; further, that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed and the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, today, we have 
good news and bad news. The good news 
is that our Democratic colleagues are 
finally discovering that the Chinese 
Communists are not our friends. They 
are finally acknowledging that the Chi-
nese Communists are murdering, tor-
turing, oppressive tyrants, and our 
Democratic colleagues are likewise dis-
covering that Hong Kong is a beacon 
for democracy and a beacon for liberty. 
That is, indeed, good news. 
The bad news is, the bill that they 
have put forth is not designed to do 
anything about it. This is not a Hong 
Kong bill. It is, instead, a Democratic 
messaging bill because House Demo-
crats made, I think, a cynical decision 
to try to exploit the crisis in Hong 
Kong to advance their longstanding 
goals of changing our immigration 
laws. 
It is not news to anyone who has 
been watching the political battles of 
recent years to discover that our 
Democratic colleagues embrace open 
borders; that when it comes to illegal 
immigration, their preference is to 
make all immigration legal. This bill 
advances that longtime partisan polit-
ical agenda that the Democrats have. 
When it comes to standing up for 
Communist China, for 8 years I have 
led the fight in this Senate to stand up 
to Communist China. China is, I be-
lieve, the single greatest geopolitical 
threat facing the United States for the 
next century. 
In October of last year, I traveled to 
Hong Kong as part of a friends and al-
lies tour throughout Asia, met with the 
Hong Kong dissidents—those brave, 
young students standing in the streets, 
standing for freedom, and standing up 
against Chinese tyrants. I did a sat-
ellite interview on an American Sun-
day show from Hong Kong dressed in 
all black in solidarity with those pro-
testers because Hong Kong today is, as 
I have said many times, the new Ber-
lin. It is the frontline in the battle 
against Communist tyranny. 
This bill, however, is not designed to 
fix that problem. Right now, today, 
under current law, individuals in Hong 
Kong are already eligible to become 
refugees under our immigration law. In 
fact, in July, President Trump explic-
itly expanded the number of refugee 
slots available and allocated them to 
Hong Kong. This bill, instead, is de-
signed and would dramatically lower 
the standards for both refugee and asy-
lum status to the point where individ-
uals would qualify even if they cannot 
establish an individualized and credible 
fear of persecution. 
The Senator from Connecticut just 
listed that as a virtue of this bill—that 
no longer would you have to establish 
a credible fear of persecution; instead, 
this bill would dramatically lower that 
standard. There is no reason to lower 
that standard, and there is particular 
risk when doing so, we know, would be 
used by the Chinese Communists to 
send even more Chinese spies into the 
United States. 
The Senator from Connecticut as-
sured us: Well, don’t worry. We will do 
a background check. 
Well, the last I checked, when the 
Chinese Communist Government sends 
spies into our country, they are quite 
willing to concoct a bogus background 
portfolio of materials. Who do you 
think the Chinese Government would 
be seeing coming in? We just recently 
had news of Chinese spies targeting 
Members of Congress—targeting promi-
nent Democrats. This is an espionage 
threat America faces of our adversaries 
taking advantage of our laws and tar-
geting our leadership. 
The truth also is that China has con-
fiscated passports and, I am told, 
stopped issuing exit visas to persons 
deemed problematic. As a result, China 
is highly unlikely to let actual dis-
sidents leave Hong Kong, so this bill 
isn’t directed to help them. 
But I will say this: We urgently need 
to have a real, substantive, bipartisan 
conversation about countering the Chi-
nese Communist Party, about defend-
ing the United States of America, 
about standing up and winning this 
battle. This bill doesn’t advance that 
objective, but what I am going to do is 
I am going to give our Democratic col-
leagues the opportunity to actually 
support legislation that would stand up 
to China. 
So, momentarily, I am going to ask 
unanimous consent for one bill and dis-
cuss a second bill that I also later in-
tend to ask unanimous consent to pass. 
But first, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
really regret this attack on a bill that 
was passed unanimously—Republicans, 
unanimously, and Democrats, unani-
mously—a bipartisan bill by the House 
of Representatives. If my colleagues 
are serious about moving a bill to the 
desk of the President, only this bill 
will do it because only this bill has 
been passed by the House of Represent-
atives. 
There is an urgency to this cause for 
the sake of these refugees who haven’t 
been permitted to leave their country, 
haven’t been sent by China, haven’t 
simply come into this country as po-
tential espionage agents. They have 
come here because they fought for free-
dom in their country. So to say that we 
have discovered that we need to stand 
up to China, sorry about that, but it is 
just preposterous. 
Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I yield to the 
Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. I would ask the ques-
tion through the Chair. Isn’t it true

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7690 
December 18, 2020 
that this bill that we are promoting, 
which just passed the House unani-
mously on a bipartisan basis, also pro-
tects the 6,700 students here in the 
United States with student visas from 
being forced to return to Hong Kong 
when our State Department is warning 
Americans it is unsafe for them to 
travel to Hong Kong? Is that not true? 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. The Senator 
from Illinois is absolutely right, and I 
was just going to, as a matter of fact, 
make that point because I think it is 
central to the objection that has been 
raised. 
In fact, the people in danger here are 
already here. They are in danger if 
they are sent back, as they would be 
without that temporary protected sta-
tus. So that point, I think, refutes, es-
sentially, the argument that has just 
been made by our colleague from 
Texas. 
Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would 
yield further for a question—and this 
notion that the Chinese in the United 
States are all suspect spies, is it real-
ly—is that the point you want to 
make? Is that really the point you 
want to make? Do we have background 
checks involved here? Do we have 
screening involved here? 
We are all intent on keeping America 
safe, but to categorize a group of peo-
ple as all potential spies—and, there-
fore, they are going to all be fed to the 
lions of Beijing if they are returned— 
seems to me to be fundamentally un-
fair and not consistent with what 
America has learned about immigra-
tion. There were suspicions in World 
War II about all those people coming 
from Europe, and they were turned 
away, many of them to their death. We 
can’t make that mistake again. If 
there is any suspect person, there is a 
way to determine that with screening, 
criminal background checks, and the 
like. 
So the 6,700 who are here, we were 
told at the hearing—I think you were 
there; it may have been a minute or 
two before you arrived—one of them is 
a student of Georgetown, for example, 
who now has a price on his head from 
the Chinese Communist Party, and the 
question is whether we are going to 
force him to return into imprisonment. 
I don’t think we want anyone who is 
suspected of spying on the United 
States at all, but to dismiss all of these 
people as possible spies doesn’t sound 
to me—does it sound to you?—as con-
sistent with who we are as a people. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. To answer the 
Senator from Illinois very directly, it 
is totally antithetical to the principles 
of democracy in the United States of 
America. It is totally abhorrent to the 
values of our constitutional Nation, 
and it is, frankly, absurd. 
Here we are, according to my col-
league from Texas, standing up and 
being tough on China, and we are doing 
what? We are sending back their oppo-
nents so they can imprison them and 
kill them? That is the notion of being 
tough on China—to enable them to im-
prison and kill their political oppo-
nents? 
I ask my colleague from Texas to 
rethink the practical implications of 
this measure and to consider why the 
House of Representatives unanimously 
passed this. It doesn’t lower the stand-
ards for political refugees coming to 
this country. It doesn’t eliminate any 
security checks. It takes people, many 
of them living here already—not spies, 
by any means—and sends them back to 
the meat grinder of the repressive Chi-
nese Communist Party. It may sound 
like good rhetoric to oppose this bill, 
but my colleague from Texas heard the 
testimony of these freedom fighters 
and why they need temporary pro-
tected status and why they support a 
safe harbor. 
So I continue to insist that this bill, 
like the Rubio-Menendez bill, protects 
essential American values, and I ask 
him to reconsider his objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3835 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, my col-
league from Connecticut just said that 
they were being tough on China. As I 
explained, this bill is not being tough 
on China. 
But a bit of good news: They will 
have the opportunity, moments from 
now, to in fact be tough on China. I 
have introduced, roughly, a dozen sepa-
rate pieces of legislation designed to do 
exactly that, to stand up to the Chi-
nese Communist Government. I am 
glad also to see my Democratic col-
leagues discovering the human rights 
travesties that are playing out in 
China. 
Look, my family knows the oppres-
sion of Communist governments. My 
father was imprisoned and tortured in 
Cuba. My aunt, my Tia Sonia, was im-
prisoned and tortured by Fidel Castro’s 
thugs. So, when it comes for standing 
for dissidents, there is a reason why, 
for 8 years, I have gone to the Senate 
floor over and over and over again 
speaking up for dissidents who are 
being tortured and oppressed by Com-
munists. Here is a chance for the 
Democrats to join us in that regard. 
Mr. President, there are two separate 
bills that I have introduced that I am 
going to discuss. The first is a bill 
called the SCRIPT Act. 
For years, we have known that Chi-
na’s surveillance state and censorship 
practices are used to maintain its 
human rights violations. And what this 
devastating pandemic has shown us is 
that China’s surveillance state and its 
censorship practices are also profound 
threats to our national security, to our 
public health, and to our public debate, 
as the Chinese Government hid infor-
mation about the COVID–19 pandemic 
that began in Wuhan, China, hid it for 
months on end and allowed millions 
across the globe to be threatened— 
their lives and health and safety to be 
threatened. 
In addition to their espionage activi-
ties, the Chinese Communist Party in-
vests billions into spreading propa-
ganda, even using American media out-
lets, 
telecommunication 
infrastruc-
ture, movies, and sports teams to 
spread their propaganda, from buying 
media outlets so that they broadcast 
propaganda into America to coercing 
Hollywood studios and sports leagues 
to self-sensor by threatening to cut off 
access to one of the world’s largest 
markets. 
The 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party spends billions and billions of 
dollars to mislead Americans about 
China and to try to shape what we see, 
what we hear and think. 
All of these activities are part of Chi-
na’s whole-of-state approach to amass 
influence around the world through in-
formation warfare, and we need to 
stand together to stop it. 
That is why I will be momentarily 
asking for unanimous consent on the 
SCRIPT Act, which would cut off Hol-
lywood studios from the assistance 
they currently receive from the U.S. 
Federal Government if those studios 
allow the Chinese Communist Govern-
ment to sensor what they are pro-
ducing. 
We have seen this pattern over and 
over and over again—Hollywood being 
complicit in China’s censorship and 
propaganda in the name of bigger prof-
it. ‘‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’’ a wonderful 
biography of Freddie Mercury and 
story of the band Queen—well, the Chi-
nese 
Government 
was 
upset 
that 
Freddie Mercury was homosexual and 
demanded 
that 
Hollywood 
sensor 
scenes that showed that Freddie Mer-
cury was homosexual. And Hollywood— 
those great, woke social warriors that 
they are—compliantly said: We are 
more interested in the money than in 
artistic 
integrity, 
than 
in 
telling 
Freddie Mercury’s story, so the Chi-
nese Government will happily edit out 
those scenes. 
‘‘Doctor Strange,’’ another movie— 
comic 
book 
movie—in 
‘‘Doctor 
Strange,’’ they changed the Ancient 
One’s character from being from Tibet, 
which is how it is portrayed in the 
comic book, to Celtic because, you 
know, the Chinese Communist censors, 
they don’t want to recognize Tibet— 
another area that has been subject to 
persecution 
and 
oppression 
from 
China—and Hollywood meekly com-
plied. 
In the sequel to ‘‘Top Gun,’’ the back 
of Maverick’s jacket—if you remember 
the first ‘‘Top Gun,’’ maybe the great-
est Navy recruiting film ever made— 
you find the Taiwanese flag and the 
Japanese flag. The Chinese censors 
didn’t like that, and so Hollywood 
meekly removed the flags. What does it 
say to the world when Maverick is 
scared of the Chinese Communists? 
I would point out, unfortunately, the 
Chinese censorship is being carried out 
by Hollywood billionaires who are get-
ting richer in the process. 
In recent days, it has been reported 
that one of Joe Biden’s top potential 
choices to be Ambassador to China is 
the former CEO of Disney, who happens

to be a major Democratic donor. Dis-
ney just came out with the movie 
‘‘Mulan.’’ In the movie ‘‘Mulan,’’ which 
the director described as ‘‘a love letter 
to China’’—well, this love letter wasn’t 
subtle because right in the credits at 
the end of ‘‘Mulan,’’ they thanked op-
pressive government forces that are 
running 
concentration 
camps 
right 
now, with over 1 million Uighurs im-
prisoned. Disney gleefully thanked the 
jackbooted thugs who are carrying out 
torture and murder, and apparently the 
leader of that effort is one of the top 
candidates to be America’s Ambassador 
to China. 
The Senator from Illinois and the 
Senator from Connecticut said: ‘‘We 
need to stand with people who are op-
pressed.’’ I agree. 
Look, Hollywood could say whatever 
they want, but there is no reason the 
Federal Government should facilitate 
their censorship on behalf of the Chi-
nese Communists. The SCRIPT Act 
says: If you are going to let the Chi-
nese Communists censor your movies, 
you are not going to get access to the 
jet planes and to the ships and all the 
different material of the Federal Gov-
ernment that are used in movies. 
Moments ago, the Senator from Con-
necticut said they want to be tough on 
China. Well, we are about to see how 
tough they are on China. 
Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 
Mr. CRUZ. I will happily yield for a 
question. 
Mr. DURBIN. Can you tell me, if you 
are successful and if you hit Hollywood 
hard, how that provides any solace to 
the 6,700 Hong Kong students in Amer-
ica who are facing deportation back to 
prison in China? 
Mr. CRUZ. The Senator from Illinois 
asked a question. Let me tell you how 
it provides solace—because people who 
are in hell holes, they listen to what 
we are saying. People who are in hell 
holes, they hear the voice—you know, 
some time ago, I had the chance to sit 
down with Natan Sharansky, the famed 
Soviet dissident. He and I sat down and 
visited in Jerusalem. Natan told me 
about how, when he was in a Soviet 
gulag, that in the cells, from cell to 
cell, they would pass notes: Did you 
hear what Ronald Reagan said? The So-
viet Union is an evil empire. Marxism- 
Leninism will end up on the ash heap 
of history. ‘‘Mr. Gorbachev, tear down 
this wall.’’ 
And I will tell you how people here— 
because if the Senator from Illinois 
will remember, I introduced legislation 
to rename the street in front of the 
Chinese Embassy in the United States 
‘‘Liu Xiaobo Plaza,’’ after Liu Xiaobo, 
the Nobel Peace laureate who was—let 
me finish answering your question. If 
you want to propound a second one, I 
am happy to answer that one too. Liu 
Xiaobo was the Nobel Peace laureate 
wrongfully imprisoned in China. And 
the strategy of renaming the street in 
front of the Embassy is the strategy 
Reagan employed renaming the street 
in 
front 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Embassy 
‘‘Sakharov Plaza.’’ 
Twice I stood on this floor seeking 
unanimous consent, and twice a Demo-
crat—the senior Senator from Cali-
fornia—stood up and objected. At one 
point, the senior Senator from Cali-
fornia said: Well, if we do this, it will 
embarrass the Chinese Government. 
I responded: You are understanding 
correctly. And that is not a bug; it is a 
feature. That is the purpose. 
Let me tell you what happened to 
that. Twice, Democrats objected to the 
legislation. I then placed a hold on 
President Obama’s nominees to the 
State Department. 
The Obama administration came to 
me and said: How could we move these 
nominees forward? How could we move 
them forward? 
I said: It is very simple. Pass my leg-
islation, and I will lift the hold. 
The Democratic caucus didn’t like 
that, but they ultimately agreed. So 
the legislation I introduced to rename 
the street in front of the Chinese Em-
bassy ‘‘Liu Xiaobo Plaza’’ passed this 
body unanimously. 
Ultimately, the House didn’t take it 
up and pass it, but I will tell you how 
that story ends. That story ends in 2017 
when I was sitting down with Rex 
Tillerson for breakfast in Foggy Bot-
tom—the new U.S. Secretary of State. 
When he spoke to his Chinese counter-
parts, he said: They have come back 
and said that among their top three 
diplomatic objectives with us is to stop 
your bill to rename the street in front 
of the Embassy. They are terrified by 
the sunlight and sunshine on the dis-
sidents. 
At the time, Liu Xiaobo had passed, 
but his widow, Liu Xia, was still in 
China, still wrongfully held back. I told 
Secretary of State Tillerson: I will tell 
you what. You tell the Chinese that if 
they release Liu Xia, if they let her get 
out, I will stop pressing this particular 
bill. If they don’t, I will keep pressing 
it, and we will pass it again because we 
have already done it. 
Within weeks, China released Liu 
Xia. 
So you ask, how does this help the 
people in prison? By not having Holly-
wood media moguls spreading Chinese 
propaganda. 
But let me give you a second choice, 
very directly. Do you want to know 
how people are helped? It is a second 
bill called the SHAME Act, which, if 
our Democratic colleagues want to be 
tough on China, we could pass right 
now. 
What does the SHAME Act do? The 
SHAME Act focuses in particular on 
human rights atrocities. It focuses on 
over 1 million Uighurs in concentration 
camps and other religious minorities 
and the Falun Gong practitioners who 
are captured and murdered and whose 
organs are harvested. And the Chinese 
Communist Party engages in yet an-
other horror. 
My Democratic colleagues like to say 
on the question of abortion that they 
are pro-choice. Well, the Chinese Com-
munist government right now is engag-
ing in forced sterilizations and forced 
abortions, taking Uighur mothers and 
forcing them to abort their children 
against their will. 
Whatever the Democrats’ views on 
abortion in the United States as a mat-
ter of a woman’s choice, surely they 
must be united in saying that a govern-
ment forcing a woman to abort her 
child, to take the life of her unborn 
child, is an unspeakable atrocity. 
So the SHAME Act does something 
very simple: It imposes sanctions on 
the Chinese Communist government 
leaders responsible for implementing 
this horrific, 1984-style policy of forced 
sterilizations and forced abortions. 
I had intended to seek unanimous 
consent for the SHAME Act as well, 
but my Democratic colleagues have 
said they are not yet able to find a 
Democrat to object, although my un-
derstanding is they intend to. I hope 
they reconsider that. 
A terrific ending for today’s debate 
would be passing the SHAME Act and 
saying: We are all standing together 
against forced abortions and grotesque 
human rights violations. Maybe that 
will happen. Maybe it won’t. But let’s 
find out where we are on the question 
of the SCRIPT Act. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Con-
necticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, I think 
we have gone a little bit far afield from 
the six pro-democracy activists living 
abroad. 
Mr. CRUZ. If the Senator from Con-
necticut—I have not yet yielded the 
floor. I am about to ask unanimous 
consent, so— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, as if in leg-
islative session, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S. 3835 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration; further, that 
this bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President.

ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object on the 
SCRIPT Act, which I understand is the 
only measure so far on which the Sen-
ator from Texas is seeking unanimous 
consent, very simply, he knows, I 
know, we all know that measure will 
never reach the President’s desk. There 
is simply no way it can pass both 
Houses of Congress in the next few 
days before the end of this Congress.

for the freedom fighters and democracy

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7692 
December 18, 2020 
advocates in Communist China is to 
pass this measure that he has objected 
to, which has unanimously passed the 
House of Representatives. Only H.R. 
8428 offers that opportunity, and frank-
ly, only this measure that he has ob-
jected to does anything for the dis-
sidents or the democracy advocates or 
the freedom fighters directly. 
He is talking about movies; we are 
talking about human lives. He can 
draw all the kinds of hypothetical con-
nections between the so-called movie 
moguls in Hollywood and China, but I 
think his SCRIPT Act actually works 
against the goal that he is advocating. 
Censorship in China is a legitimate 
concern, no question about it, and I 
would welcome the opportunity to 
work with him on a bill that does 
something about it. But actually his 
bill not only takes away the support 
for the movies that may be made; it 
takes away support for documentaries 
about the repressive regime in China, 
and it takes away classification and 
other security screening that are nec-
essary for those kinds of movies to be 
shown in this country. I think that 
kind of obstacle may be inadvertent on 
his part. But I welcome the chance to 
work with him on a bipartisan bill, a 
truly bipartisan bill that, in fact, in 
the next Congress could reach the 
President’s desk. This one that he is of-
fering, the SCRIPT Act, goes nowhere. 
But I just want to bring us back to 
the reality that really is at issue here. 
Just last Wednesday afternoon of this 
week, two of the activists among the 
six 
pro-democracy 
fighters 
living 
abroad, charged under China’s new na-
tional security law, were before our 
committee. I am wondering what they 
are thinking when they hear my col-
league from Texas pounding the table 
about being tough on China but object-
ing to a bill that guarantees them pro-
tection. As I say, I am talking about 
their lives and tens of thousands of 
others. I am not talking about movies. 
I am not talking about Hollywood mo-
guls. 
Let’s stand up for the lives of those 
Chinese Hong Kong freedom fighters 
now in this country seeking protection 
through a bill passed unanimously by 
the House of Representatives—the only 
bill that will go to the President’s desk 
if we approve it. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Three brief observations: 
No. 1, the Senator from Connecticut 
said multiple times that the House bill 
in question passed the House unani-
mously. I am sure this is inadvertent, 
but what the Senator from Connecticut 
said is simply wrong. It passed the 
House by voice vote, which is a very 
different thing from passing unani-
mously. It simply means the vote tally 
was not recorded. 
Secondly, the Senator from Con-
necticut said the SCRIPT Act is not 
going to pass this Congress. Well, that 
appears to be correct, but that is for 
one reason and one reason only, which 
is the final two words uttered by the 
Senator from Connecticut: ‘‘I object.’’ 
Quite literally by doing nothing, 
quite literally by giving the identical 
speech he had just given and then clos-
ing his mouth before those final two 
words—had that occurred, the SCRIPT 
Act would have passed this body unani-
mously. 
So the only reason the SCRIPT Act 
isn’t passing is because the Senate 
Democrats are objecting. And it should 
not be lost on anybody that the Holly-
wood billionaires who are enriching 
themselves with this Chinese propa-
ganda are among the biggest political 
donors to today’s Democratic Party in 
the entire country. 
The Senator from Connecticut said: 
Well, the SCRIPT Act might make it 
possible to have documentaries on the 
human rights abuses in China. Oh, real-
ly. That argument staggers the mind. 
It so defies reality because—you know 
what—Hollywood doesn’t make movies 
about the human rights abuses in 
China. 
Earlier this year, I had the oppor-
tunity to meet Richard Gear. Now, 
Richard Gear is not someone you would 
ordinarily imagine palling around with 
a conservative Republican from Texas, 
but Richard Gear was up here. He was 
up here actually standing up against 
Chinese abuses and urging anyone who 
would listen—Republican or Demo-
crat—to stand with him. 
Do you know Richard Gear has not 
made a single major Hollywood movie 
in a decade? Why? Because he dared 
stand with Tibet, and the Hollywood 
billionaires blackballed Richard Gear. 
If you speak out for Tibet, if you do 
what the Senator from Connecticut 
just suggested and discuss the Chinese 
human rights abuses—it doesn’t matter 
that Richard Gear used to be an A-list 
Hollywood blockbuster actor—boom— 
his career is dead because no studio 
will produce a movie with him because 
he spoke the truth. 
By the way, my bill presents zero 
barriers to someone actually making a 
documentary on the human rights 
abuses in China because, presumably, if 
you are making that documentary, you 
wouldn’t allow the Chinese Communist 
Government to censor it. 
I don’t know what kind of documen-
taries the Senator from Connecticut is 
familiar with, but I am not familiar 
with documentaries done on tyrants 
and concentration camps where you let 
the concentration camp guards edit out 
the stuff they don’t like. That ain’t a 
documentary. 
The Senator from Connecticut said 
perhaps we can work together in a bi-
partisan manner to address this. I hope 
so. Standing together against the op-
pression of the Chinese Communists 
would be a very good thing for the U.S. 
Senate. It would be a very good thing 
for our country. Unfortunately, at 
least today, that hasn’t yet happened. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
the only ones happy with the outcome 
of today’s debate are the Chinese Gov-
ernment. I regret this outcome because 
there probably was a time when we 
would have cooperated in a bipartisan 
way on both of these matters. 
It may not have been unanimous. 
There may have been a few contrary 
votes in the House, but clearly it came 
here with bipartisan support, and I re-
gret that the outcome today is not bi-
partisan agreement to protect those 
freedom fighters who came before the 
Judiciary Committee and who have 
risked their lives. 
This issue is not going away. We will 
be back because, fortunately, the activ-
ists from Hong Kong will persist in 
their fight, and we ought to do every-
thing we can to make sure they have a 
safe haven in this country and that 
they are protected here. 
So my closing plea to my colleague 
from Texas is that maybe there re-
mains time, even in this setting, but, if 
not, we need to take a stand as a na-
tion 
against 
Chinese 
censorship, 
against repression by the Chinese, and 
come together and work together. I 
thank the chairman. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
the first thing I want to do is comment 
on the discussions we just had. 
I have been up here a little less than 
2 years, and the thing that surprises 
me is, invariably, the Democrats won’t 
stand up against the Communist Party 
in China. 
The case that we are dealing with 
now is they are going to stand up for 
Hollywood rather than rights, rights 
that we have here that I am going to 
talk about in a second. 
We ought to be standing up against 
Communist China stealing our jobs, 
our technology. We ought to be attack-
ing the Communist Party for what 
they have done to Uighurs, for organ 
harvesting, for taking away the basic 
rights of Hong Kong citizens. 
Invariably, I watch my Democratic 
colleagues; they won’t stand up against 
Communist China. I don’t understand 
it. This is a party that clearly wants to 
dominate our society, our way of life. 
They completely disagree with our way 
of life. 
I want to thank Senator TED CRUZ 
for his continued fight for rights, for 
all the rights that we have in this 
country but fighting for those rights so 
people, whether in Hong Kong or in 
Communist China or in Taiwan, have 
the same freedoms that we have. 
So I want to thank Senator TED CRUZ 
for showing up today and doing this. 
Mr. CRUZ. Thank you.

first freedom under the Constitution of 
the United States. Americans have the 
right to freely exercise religion, a sa-
cred right that I will always fight for. 
There is no pandemic exception to 
the First Amendment. Unfortunately, 
we have seen liberal Governors and 
mayors across the country use the 
coronavirus 
pandemic 
to 
go 
after 
churches, synagogues, mosques, and 
other houses of worship. For months, 
they have argued that houses of wor-
ship should not meet and congregants 
could not sing. They have condemned 
in-person worship services as a threat 
to public safety, all while they applaud 
massive political protests. 
We saw it happen right here in the 
Nation’s Capital. Mayor Bowser refused 
to grant a waiver to the Capitol Hill 
Baptist Church for religious gatherings 
but supported mass protests that vio-
lated her own orders. The church had 
to sue the city in Federal court for the 
right to gather, and the court ruled in 
favor of the church. 
It is simply hypocritical and uncon-
stitutional to target religious institu-
tions while letting other businesses op-
erate. We know those on the left will 
take every opportunity to infringe on 
Americans’ First Amendment rights, 
but we won’t let it happen. 
This year has been challenging, and 
for many of us, our faith and our com-
munities have helped us through it. 
Government doesn’t have the right to 
take this away from American citizens. 
I am proud to lead a resolution today 
with 15 of my colleagues to call out 
those who have wrongly tried to pre-
vent Americans from practicing their 
faith. This is about rights granted to 
Americans under our Constitution. 
What is the one thing every Amer-
ican believes in and has agreed to up-
hold. It is our Constitution, which we 
have each sworn to uphold as elected 
officials also. 
We each took the same oath of office: 
I do solemnly swear that I will support and 
defend the Constitution of the United States 
against all enemies, foreign and domestic; 
that I will bear true faith and allegiance to 
the same; that I will take this obligation 
freely, without any mental reservation or 
purpose of evasion; and that I will well and 
faithfully discharge the duties of the office 
on which I am about to enter. So help me 
God. 
There is no reason anyone should ob-
ject to upholding our Constitution. I 
will always fight for the religious lib-
erty of all Americans, and I look for-
ward to my colleagues passing this im-
portant resolution today. 
However, I now am going to wait be-
cause I understand one of my Demo-
cratic colleagues is going to come ob-
ject to upholding the Constitution and 
the First Amendment, the Bill of 
Rights. This is shocking to me. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 
806, submitted earlier today; further, I 
ask unanimous consent that the reso-
lution be agreed to, the preamble be 
agreed to, and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, my col-
league Senator SCOTT has chosen an in-
teresting point in this pandemic to ob-
ject to public safety measures intended 
to protect human life and ensure scarce 
resources are not squandered. 
Over 17 million Americans—17 mil-
lion—have contracted COVID, that we 
know of, and over 300,000 of our friends 
and our neighbors and loved ones are 
no longer with us. Think about that. 
September 11 was a great national 
tragedy. I know because I lost 700 of 
those 3,000 citizens, on that fateful day, 
from New Jersey. This is 100 times 
more than what happened on Sep-
tember 11. 
The people we have lost are not just 
some nameless numbers but mothers 
and fathers and grandparents. Essen-
tial parts of our hearts are gone forever 
due to a pandemic that has been mis-
handled and mismanaged from the 
start. And now, when this virus is run-
ning unchecked through our commu-
nities, we have before us this resolu-
tion that is riddled with misstatements 
of fact that I find deeply concerning. 
No Governor wants to see their con-
stituents cut off from their daily lives, 
and I think we can all agree that the 
administration here in Washington— 
their inability to guide us through this 
crisis—has left our Governors holding 
the bag when it comes to securing re-
sources, providing guidance, and mak-
ing the difficult calls about the right 
public policy to prevent COVID–19 from 
rampaging like an unchecked bull in a 
China shop through our States because 
they know, the Governors of our 
States, that the lives of their resi-
dents—our neighbors, brothers, sisters, 
children, and parents—rest in their 
hands and these difficult decisions they 
must make. 
We are still losing Americans from 
COVID–19 at an unprecedented rate. 
Hospitals throughout the country are 
providing an amazing level of care with 
exhausted providers and continued re-
source issues. And our economy is 
cratering because we cannot fully re-
open it until it is safe. 
I am deeply troubled to see a false 
claim about my State and the Gov-
ernor banning indoor religious services. 
Let me be clear, houses of worship were 
never ordered closed—never. In fact, 
today, religious gatherings are allowed 
to have substantially higher capacity 
limits than most other gatherings. 
While New Jersey restricted the ca-
pacity of indoor religious services, as 
they did with all indoor gatherings, re-
ligious gatherings were never—never— 
designated as nonessential or essential, 
as this resolution suggests. That dis-
tinction was only applied to retail 
businesses. 
Perhaps religion is different in Flor-
ida, but our houses of worship are not 
retail businesses. Houses of worship 
and religious organizations have been 
subject to neutral restrictions that 
equally burden religious and nonreli-
gious entities. They were put in place 
to do what? To save lives, not under 
the guise of doing so and certainly not 
for the purpose of targeting religious 
groups. 
I am a man of strong faith and con-
viction. I have always found deep sol-
ace in the rituals and shared worship of 
my church. I know many of us have. 
But perhaps the most important part 
of my faith is the duty, the responsi-
bility to care for my neighbors up and 
down the State of New Jersey and all 
across the Nation. Our faith calls us to 
ensure the health and safety of this Na-
tion before all else. 
As a matter of fact, I am reminded of 
a passage in the Bible of James 2:14. It 
says: 
What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if 
you say you have faith but do not have 
works? Can faith save you? If a brother or 
sister is naked and lacks daily food, and one 
of you says to them, ‘‘Go in peace; keep 
warm and get your fill,’’ and yet you do not 
supply their bodily needs, what is the good of 
that? So faith by itself, if it has no works, is 
dead. But someone will say, ‘‘You have faith 
and I have works.’’ Show me your faith apart 
from your works, and I by my works will 
show you my faith. 
As for me, I will continue to work for 
the 
people 
of 
New 
Jersey, 
our 
healthcare workers struggling to care 
for the thousands filling ICU hospital 
beds, for the families who don’t know 
how they will pay next month’s rent 
and keep food on the table, for the 
small business owner trying to keep his 
doors open, and, yes, for the churches 
that want the see their parishioners 
safe. I, however, do not intend to play 
these partisan games. For those rea-
sons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
freedom of religion shouldn’t be con-
troversial. This is a fundamental right 
of our Nation, as stated in our Con-
stitution: ‘‘Congress shall make no law 
respecting the establishment of reli-
gion, or prohibiting the free exercise 
thereof.’’ 
What this resolution says is that the 
Senate affirms its support for the 
rights, liberties, and protections en-
shrined in the U.S. Constitution. 
There is no pandemic exception to 
the First Amendment. For months, 
across this country, liberal politicians 
have targeted churches, synagogues, 
mosques, and other houses of worship. 
To let this happen undermines the 
principle of our Nation and the Con-
stitution we have each sworn to uphold 
as elected officials. I don’t understand 
why my colleague, who swore to uphold 
the Constitution, would object to a res-
olution that simply reaffirms our com-
mitment to upholding the Constitu-
tion. 
We are blessed to live in a great na-
tion that respects religious liberty and

the right to worship, especially as we 
see countries around the world like 
Communist China and Iran deny their 
citizens these same rights. Americans 
have the right to worship, and govern-
ment doesn’t get to decide for them. 
I am clearly very disappointed that 
my colleague doesn’t want to protect 
the First Amendment, but I will con-
tinue to stand against these misguided 
and hypocritical attempts to target re-
ligious institutions. I am never going 
to stop fighting for the religious lib-
erty of all Americans, even during a 
pandemic. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
know that my colleague, I understand, 
is going to be the next chair of the Re-
publican Senatorial Campaign Com-
mittee, and he has every right to do 
that, but what he has no right to do is 
misrepresent in this resolution what, 
at least in my State, is going on. 
You cannot say that churches were 
designated by the State of New Jersey 
as nonessential or essential. That sim-
ply is not true. It is simply not true. 
You cannot suggest that somehow 
these purposes are to target religions. 
They are to save lives. 
Now, maybe if my colleague and oth-
ers here had spoken up when the ad-
ministration was asleep at the switch 
as this pandemic was raging, maybe if 
my colleagues had spoken up when we 
found out that the President knew 
back in January, early February of 
this year, of how vicious this pandemic 
could be, how contagious it could be, 
how it was transmitted, but said noth-
ing to the American people—and that 
silence was echoed in this Chamber— 
well, maybe then we wouldn’t in the 
position that we are in. Maybe we 
wouldn’t have lost 300,000 of our fellow 
Americans. 
So I find it really, really upsetting 
that, in the midst of a raging pan-
demic, one would seek to obtain a po-
litical value out of something that is 
simply not the case—simply not the 
case. I think there is a lot more to be 
done in this Chamber to stop this pan-
demic, to stop more lives from being 
lost, to save our brothers and sisters, 
to help those who have been ravaged by 
the pandemic, but not to pick a few 
States that happen to be Democratic— 
please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT. So if my colleague from 
New Jersey’s concern is the paragraph 
numbered 4 on page 3, I would ask him 
if he would object if we just take that 
paragraph out and then he would be 
willing to affirm that the Senate be-
lieves in religious freedom. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. The resolution is 
replete with inaccuracies, and, there-
fore, I will continue to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Let’s remem-
ber, the concern was that he didn’t like 
the section about New Jersey and said 
that was inaccurate, but the idea that 
the Senate will support religious free-
dom, he is not willing to stand behind. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). The Senator from Michigan. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we 
truly don’t have any time to waste. 
The American people are in desperate 
need of help. And I want to start by 
thanking all of my colleagues who have 
been working so hard together across 
the aisle to bring us to a point where 
we can actually provide some help, al-
beit temporary, to the American peo-
ple. So, thank you, and I am pleased to 
have been involved in elements of that 
negotiation and appreciate it. 
But we are stuck right now, and I 
just want to remind people of a few 
numbers. More than one in three Amer-
ican adults in a recent survey said they 
are struggling to pay household ex-
penses, including rent and mortgage. If 
we don’t get something done in the 
next hours or days, we are going to see 
thousands of people in Michigan lose 
their homes in the middle of the win-
ter. 
There are 7.8 million Americans who 
have fallen into poverty since June—7.8 
million people have fallen into poverty 
since June. The number of people ap-
plying for unemployment keeps rising. 
There were 885,000 people who filed ini-
tial claims last week, and thousands 
and thousands and thousands of people 
who are self-employed, who are con-
tract workers, and others, will find 
themselves with zero support right 
after Christmas, unless we take action. 
A recent survey found that one in 
four small businesses are in danger of 
closing if the economic conditions 
don’t improve—one out of four. I have 
talked to so many friends, so many 
people in Michigan, vibrant small busi-
nesses—they put it all on the line for 
that business they always wanted to 
have—and now they are barely holding 
on. They need help, and they needed 
help before now. They need help now. 
They are waiting and waiting and wait-
ing and holding their breath. 
Up to 50 million Americans are strug-
gling to feed their families right now. 
One out of four American households 
have experienced food insecurity in 
this last year—so one out of four 
households. People who volunteer at 
the food bank and people who have al-
ways contributed to the food bank now 
find themselves waiting in their car for 
hours and hours for a box of food in the 
United States of America. We not only 
have a health pandemic; we have a 
hunger crisis going on, and people need 
help now. 
On top of that, this past Wednesday, 
3,638 Americans died in 1 day of 
coronavirus, and we are now looking at 
government services shutting down in 
less than 12 hours—the backdrop of ev-
erything that is happening for Ameri-
cans. And despite all the good work 
that has been going on, on a bipartisan 
basis, we are now looking at less than 
12 hours of services for people and to 
our country shutting down. 
And why? Because my colleague, the 
Republican 
Senator 
from 
Pennsyl-
vania, thinks it is more important to 
take away the Federal Government’s 
ability to help people and help busi-
nesses and create jobs than it is to ac-
tually help people. Now, I want to say, 
Senator TOOMEY and I had a wonderful 
hearing this week in our HELP Sub-
committee on Finance, of which he 
chairs, and we have been working to-
gether doing really important, mean-
ingful things on Alzheimer’s disease, 
and I very much enjoyed doing that. 
But on this issue—on this issue, at this 
time, with so many people in pain and 
so much hardship at this moment—I 
don’t understand when he said that 
preventing the next Treasury Sec-
retary and the Federal Reserve from 
relaunching the emergency credit fa-
cilities that support manufacturers and 
other job providers is ‘‘the most impor-
tant thing’’ in this COVID–19 package. 
Really? Really? The most important 
thing in this package is to take away 
the tools of the Treasury and the Fed-
eral Reserve that have been used when 
we are in crisis, and we need to be a 
backstop for our businesses in the cred-
it market, when we need to be sup-
porting job providers and jobs? Really? 
Really? That is the most important 
thing? 
Tell that to a mom who is afraid her 
kids will end up on the street because 
she can’t pay her rent in January, 
which is what, 2 weeks away. Tell that 
to the small business owner who is hav-
ing to lay off their entire staff a week 
before Christmas. Tell that to a senior 
citizen who is risking his health by 
waiting in an hours-long line to get a 
box of food. Tell that to the healthcare 
workers who are literally putting their 
lives on the line right now fighting this 
pandemic. 
Really? Taking away economic tools 
from the Treasury and the Fed are 
more important than people in our 
country? Small businesses? Farmers, 
who have been hanging on? Really? 
Tell that to the thousands of Amer-
ican families who are preparing for 
their first holiday without loved ones 
who have been lost to the virus. Just 
yesterday, another loss in Michigan— 
so many losses, thousands of losses— 
but a dear friend, a sheriff of Wayne 
County, Benny Napoleon, his family, 
today, a funeral for a friend as well in 
Detroit. 
So the most important thing is not 
supporting families, is not helping peo-
ple at least get through the winter, at 
least get through the next several 
months to put food on the table and a 
roof over their heads and help their 
businesses and make sure the vaccines 
can be distributed and support our 
healthcare workers and put money into 
education and all the other things that 
are needed right now—the most impor-
tant thing is to have a fight with the

Treasury and the Fed because you 
want to limit what they can do in 
terms of their powers to help people 
and to help businesses in a crisis. 
Our Nation is in a crisis, and we 
would be in an even deeper crisis right 
now if it weren’t for the Federal Re-
serve. The Federal Reserve stepped in 
early during the crisis. Under the cur-
rent 
administration, 
I 
might 
add, 
where nobody was suggesting that we 
provide these kinds of amendments or 
restrictions then—under the current 
administration, under the Trump ad-
ministration, I didn’t hear that debate. 
Maybe I missed it, but I didn’t hear 
that debate. But thank goodness we 
didn’t have a debate because they 
stepped in early, taking extraordinary 
measures to keep credit from freezing 
up for our businesses. This is the 
money that businesses use to provide 
services and keep people employed. 
And I have to say, as someone com-
ing from a major manufacturing State 
like Pennsylvania, like Ohio, like Indi-
ana, like Wisconsin, that having the 
capacity for the Fed to step in and pro-
vide some confidence in the market-
place so that our auto suppliers and 
our other manufacturers could get 
what they needed in terms of the cred-
it, it was critical to jobs—thousands 
and thousands and thousands and thou-
sands of jobs. 
The emergency powers that the Fed-
eral Reserve passed were put in place 
during the 2008 financial crisis so that 
the Fed could respond quickly to the 
next crisis. Well, here we are in the 
next crisis. The crisis is all around us, 
and yet some are laser-focused on tak-
ing away the Fed’s ability to respond 
in the future with a new President— 
not the current sitting President but a 
future President. This is like a fire de-
partment selling off their fire trucks 
while houses down the street are burn-
ing. 
Now, 2020 has been brutal—really 
brutal—on families and businesses and 
communities across the country. And 
this crisis is not over. I really wish it 
was. I mean, we have hope because of 
the vaccines and more effective testing 
and so on, but this isn’t over, and 
things could get worse in 2021 if we sab-
otage the very things that helped us 
this year. If this is how you are setting 
up a new President to not have the 
tools to make the economy better, 
what does that say about what people 
care about—the people we represent? 
Because, ultimately, it is about people 
losing their jobs; it is about businesses. 
This is more than just about cross-par-
tisan politics. 
My friend Senator SCHATZ, who has a 
way with words, on Twitter, put it this 
way: 
We almost have a bipartisan COVID pack-
age, but at the last minute Republicans are 
making a demand that WAS NEVER MEN-
TIONED AS KEY TO THE NEGOTIATIONS. 
They want to block the FED from helping 
the economy under Biden. It’s the reason we 
don’t have a deal. 
Is that really the reason we don’t 
have a deal to help people in our coun-
try right now? Just cross-partisan poli-
tics wanting to set up a way for the 
next President to fail? Because when 
colleagues take away tools that a 
President—any 
President—and 
the 
Federal Reserve have to boost the 
economy and prevent economic col-
lapses, they are saying they care more 
about that cross-political fight—make 
sure somebody looks bad and make 
sure somebody fails—rather than car-
ing about the people we represent who 
create the jobs, the businesses, large 
and small, and the people who have 
those jobs and the people who need 
those jobs. 
Michigan is the proud home to so 
many small- and medium-sized manu-
facturing businesses that employ thou-
sands of people. I know there are those 
same businesses across the country, in-
cluding the State of Pennsylvania, 
where my colleague is advocating for 
this. 
I would urge—strongly urge—at this 
moment in time, at the end of what has 
been such a horrible, difficult year for 
Americans, I would urge my colleague 
from Pennsylvania and any others sup-
porting him to try stop trying to un-
dermine American jobs and our ability 
as a country to respond to the eco-
nomic crisis that is still happening. 
Let’s stop stalling. We need to do our 
jobs to keep our military going and 
healthcare and education and transpor-
tation and all the other critical serv-
ices that the Federal Government 
funds. And we need to pass this critical 
COVID legislation today and give the 
American people the help they need 
and the help they deserve to survive 
the next few months of this health and 
economic crisis. 
A wonderful bipartisan effort brought 
us to this moment where we can pro-
vide a critical lifeline to Americans 
across our country. 
It would be a tragedy and an outrage 
if efforts to undermine our economy 
and the success of our incoming Presi-
dent stop this urgent help from being 
passed. We need to get this done now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 5063 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this 
country faces the worst set of public 
health and economic crises that we 
have faced in over 100 years. 
As a result of the pandemic, more 
people than ever before are becoming 
infected, right now. Hospitalization is 
higher than it has ever been before, 
right now. And more people are dying 
than ever before, literally day after 
day. 
Now, we all hope and pray that the 
new vaccine will be distributed as 
quickly as possible and that it will put 
an end to this nightmare. But, today, 
the truth is that millions of low-in-
come and middle-class families are suf-
fering in a way that they have not suf-
fered since the Great Depression of the 
1930s. 
Today, the reality is that over half of 
our workers are living paycheck to 
paycheck, trying to survive on a star-
vation wage of 10 or 12 bucks an hour. 
The reality is that millions of our sen-
ior citizens are trapped in their homes, 
unable to see their kids or their grand-
children, unable to go to a grocery 
store, and many of them are trying to 
get by on $12,000-, $14,000-a-year Social 
Security and scared that they may 
come down with the virus and die. 
In addition, millions more with dis-
abilities are suffering. Further, in our 
country today, one out of four workers 
is either unemployed or makes less 
than $20,000 a year. And in the midst of 
this pandemic, because we are the only 
major country on Earth not to guar-
antee healthcare to all people as a 
right—in the midst of this pandemic, 
the worst healthcare crisis in 100 years, 
over 90 million Americans are unin-
sured or underinsured and unable to go 
to a doctor when they need to. 
Further, we have the worst eviction 
crisis in modern history. Some 30 mil-
lion families worry that because they 
cannot pay their rent, they may end up 
out on the street. 
That is where we are today economi-
cally, and if this country means any-
thing—if democracy means anything, if 
the U.S. Government means anything— 
it means that we cannot turn our backs 
on this suffering, not in Vermont, not 
in Wisconsin, not in New York, not in 
any State in this country where people 
are hurting in an unprecedented way. 
It means that we cannot leave Wash-
ington, as Senators, for the holidays to 
go back to our families unless we ad-
dress the pain and anxiety of other 
families throughout this country. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague 
from Vermont yield for some support 
for his amendment? 
Mr. SANDERS. I would be happy to 
yield to the minority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I will speak briefly. 
And I thank my colleague. 
I join my friend Senator SANDERS to 
support his amendment to give $1,200 in 
direct financial support to the Amer-
ican people in the yearend emergency 
relief bill. 
Now, this effort should not subtract 
from any other program already in the 
bill, like enhanced unemployment, aid 
to 
small 
businesses, 
education, 
healthcare, or any other provision. We 
don’t need to offset the cost or cut 
from elsewhere in the bill to make sure 
the stimulus checks are $1,200 for each 
adult and then money for children and 
others, as he will elaborate. Much of 
the money will go back into the econ-
omy anyway. 
The reason for the amendment is 
simple. Over the course of this pan-
demic, working Americans have taken 
it on the chin. Millions have lost their 
jobs through no fault of their own. 
Twenty-six million have had trouble 
putting food on the table in the last 5 
weeks, bread lines stretching down 
American highways. Twelve million 
Americans will owe an average of $6,000 
in rent and mortgage payments. So we 
have an opportunity in this emergency

December 18, 2020 
relief bill to give financial aid di-
rectly—directly to those Americans. It 
could mean the difference between 
Americans paying the rent or not, af-
fording groceries or not, the difference 
between hanging on until the vaccine 
helps our country get back to normal. 
Now, the only objection we have 
heard is that this will add too much to 
the deficit. That is why a Republican 
Senator rejected a similar request ear-
lier today—to push a baseless agenda of 
austerity. Please. 
By now, Republican objections over 
the debt and deficit are comical. They 
added $2 trillion to the debt with a 
massive tax cut for corporations and 
the wealthy, and that was during a 
steady economy. But now the economy 
is on life support. Americans are queu-
ing up on bread lines and filing for un-
employment. Just as a Democratic 
President is about to take office, all of 
the sudden the deficit scolds are back. 
It is ludicrous. Chairman Powell— 
hardly a big liberal—of the Federal Re-
serve insisted: ‘‘The risk of overdoing 
it is less than the risk of underdoing 
it.’’ 
The quickest way to get money into 
the pockets of the American people is 
to send some of their tax dollars right 
back where they came from. So let’s 
step up to the plate and deliver the 
$1,200 survival checks to millions of 
Americans before the holidays. 
I support Senator SANDERS’ request 
fully and hope the Senate will consent. 
I yield back. 
Mr. SANDERS. Let me thank the 
senior Senator from New York, the 
Democratic leader, for his strong state-
ment. He is exactly right. In this kind 
of crisis, it is comical that suddenly 
our Republican friends, once again, dis-
cover that we have a deficit. This is a 
moment of emergency—of emergency— 
and we have to respond to the needs of 
working families. And I thank Senator 
SCHUMER for his strong support for this 
legislation. 
Members of Congress should also be 
aware that we are far behind other 
major countries in terms of protecting 
working families during this pandemic. 
Not only does every other wealthy 
country guarantee healthcare to all 
people as a human right, almost all of 
them are providing far more generous 
benefits to the unemployed and the 
struggling in their countries than we 
are doing in our country. 
Several months ago, I introduced leg-
islation, along with Senator KAMALA 
HARRIS—now 
our 
Vice 
President- 
elect—and 
Senator 
MARKEY
that 
would, during the course of this eco-
nomic crisis, provide $2,000 a month— 
$2,000 a month—to every working-class 
person in this country. And, frankly, 
that is exactly what we should be 
doing. But, unfortunately, given the 
conservative nature of the Senate, I 
understand that is not going to happen. 
Yet, at a time of massive income and 
wealth inequality, as Senator SCHUMER 
just indicated, at a time when huge 
corporations 
were 
making 
record-
breaking profits, the Republican lead-
ership here in the Senate was able to 
provide over $1 trillion in tax breaks to 
the 1 percent and large corporations. 
Yes, at a time when climate change— 
yes, climate change is real—threatens 
the entire planet, this Congress was 
able to provide hundreds of billions of 
dollars in corporate welfare to the oil 
companies and the gas companies and 
the coal companies that are exacer-
bating the climate crisis. 
Yes, just the other day, here in the 
Senate and in the House, legislation 
was passed which would provide $740 
billion to the military—the largest 
military budget in history, more than 
the next 10 nations combined. We spend 
more on the military than the next 10 
nations combined. 
So we could do all of those things— 
tax breaks for billionaires, massive 
corporate welfare, huge military ex-
penditures—but in the midst of the 
worst economic meltdown since the 
Great Depression, somehow Congress is 
unable to respond effectively to the 
needs of working families. 
As the Presiding Officer may know, I 
have recently introduced legislation to 
provide every working-class American 
an emergency payment of at least 
$1,200, which is $2,400 for a couple and 
$500 for each of their children. 
This is not a radical idea. This is an 
idea that is supported by President 
Donald Trump. It is an idea that is sup-
ported by President-Elect Joe Biden. It 
is an idea, by the way, that according 
to a recent poll, is supported by 75 per-
cent of all Americans, including 77 per-
cent of Democrats and 72 percent of Re-
publicans. 
Further, importantly, this amount of 
direct payment is exactly what Con-
gress passed unanimously 9 months ago 
as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act. 
Let me repeat. In March, every Mem-
ber of the House and Senate, appro-
priately, including myself, voted to 
provide a direct payment of $1,200 for 
working-class adults, $2,400 for couples, 
and $500 for their kids. 
That was the right thing to do 9 
months ago. And given the fact that 
the crisis today is, in many respects, 
worse than it was 9 months ago, that is 
exactly what we should be doing right 
now. 
As a result of the pandemic, the gov-
ernment told restaurants, bars, retail 
stores, movie theaters, schools, malls, 
small businesses all over this country: 
Shut your doors. It is too dangerous for 
you to be open now. And they did that 
because that is what the public health 
experts said was the right thing to do 
in order to control this horrific pan-
demic. 
But what the government has not 
done is provide the workers who lost 
their jobs and lost their incomes as a 
result of those shutdowns with the help 
that they need in order to pay their 
bills and to survive economically. 
The $600 a week in supplemental un-
employment benefits that Congress 
passed unanimously in March expired 
in July—over 5 months ago—and dur-
ing that time, the Republican Senate 
has done nothing to help working fami-
lies pay their rent, feed their children, 
go to a doctor, or pay for the lifesaving 
prescription drugs they need. And the 
Senate has not done anywhere near 
enough to provide help for the strug-
gling small businesses in Vermont and 
all across this country that are des-
perately trying to stay afloat. 
Further, as bad as the economy has 
been in general, it has been far worse 
for African Americans and Latinos. 
During the pandemic, nearly 60 percent 
of Latino families and 55 percent of Af-
rican-American families have either 
experienced a job loss or a cut in pay. 
For 9 months, we have asked tens of 
millions of working people in this 
country to survive on one $1,200 check, 
with no help for healthcare, no support 
for hazard pay, no assistance for rent 
relief—absolutely nothing. Meanwhile, 
I should mention that over the same 9- 
month period, 651 billionaires in the 
United States became over $1 trillion 
richer. A trillion dollars in increased 
wealth for the very richest people in 
our country and one $1,200 check for 
tens of millions of Americans des-
perately trying to survive. That is un-
conscionable, that is immoral, and that 
has to change. 
Now, let us recall that way back in 
May, the House of Representatives 
passed the $3.4 trillion Heroes Act, 
which, among other things, included 
$600 a week in supplemental unemploy-
ment benefits; another direct payment 
of $1,200 for working-class adults and 
$500 for their kids; and generous sup-
port for small businesses, hospitals, 
education facilities, and State and 
local government. In other words, the 
House passed a $3.4 trillion bill that 
was, in fact, a very serious effort to ad-
dress the enormous crises facing our 
country. 
I should also add that in July, sev-
eral months later, the House passed an-
other version of the bill, so-called He-
roes 2, and this legislation was for $2.2 
trillion. 
That same month, in July, Senate 
Majority Leader MITCH
MCCONNELL 
proposed a $1.1 trillion bill that also 
provided a $1,200 direct payment for 
working-class adults and $500 for their 
kids. 
Then, 
in 
October, 
Secretary 
Mnuchin, in negotiations with Speaker 
PELOSI, proposed a COVID relief plan 
for $1.8 trillion. That is Mnuchin rep-
resenting the Trump administration. 
So in the last number of months, we 
have had major proposals of $3.4 tril-
lion, $2.2 trillion, $1.8 trillion, and from 
Majority Leader MCCONNELL, $1.1 tril-
lion. Yet today, right now, after 
months of negotiating by the so-called 
Gang of 8, we are now down to just $908 
billion in legislation, and that includes 
$560 billion in offsets, in unused money, 
from the CARES Act. 
So what we are talking about now is 
going from an original House bill 
passed in May calling for $3.4 trillion in 
new money, down to today $348 billion

in new money—roughly 10 percent of 
what Democrats thought was origi-
nally needed. In my view, the $348 bil-
lion in new money that is included in 
the proposal now being discussed is to-
tally inadequate given the nature of 
the unprecedented crises that we face. 
The American people cannot wait 
any longer. They need economic relief 
right now. Their kids are going hungry. 
They are being evicted from their 
homes. They can’t go to the doctor. 
They need help, and they need it now. 
Every working-class American needs 
$1,200 at least, $2,400 for couples, and 
$500 for children. 
Let me be clear to emphasize a point 
that Senator SCHUMER made, and that 
is, what I am talking about now is 
money that must not be taken from 
other 
important 
priorities 
like 
16 
weeks of supplemental unemployment 
benefits; aid for small business, nutri-
tion, housing, education; and the other 
important provisions in this bill. We 
need adequate funding to address the 
unprecedented crises that we face. We 
should not and cannot and must not 
take from Peter to pay Paul. We can-
not cut unemployment benefits in 
order to help small business. We have 
to do it all, right now. 
So, Madam President, as if in legisla-
tive session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of S. 5063, which I 
introduced earlier today, which would 
provide a $1,200 direct payment to 
every working-class adult, $2,400 for 
couples, and $500 for their children; and 
that the bill be considered read three 
times and passed and the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Reserving the right 
to object, the Senator from Vermont 
made a couple of statements that I 
would just like to repeat the words: 
that we are in a crisis; this is an emer-
gency; we can’t turn our backs on the 
suffering. 
I agree. I have agreed for months. 
But he also said something that is 
completely incorrect. You might call it 
a lie. He said that Republicans have 
done nothing. That is not true. 
I was on daily calls during the Au-
gust recess after we had attempted and 
were debating internally a trillion-dol-
lar package at the tail end of July be-
fore the August recess, recognizing— 
and I was one of the ones pointing 
out—the fact that we had already 
passed, as the good Senator from 
Vermont said, over $3 trillion in four 
different COVID relief financial pack-
ages early in the pandemic. At that 
point in time, there was $1.2 trillion of 
that unspent. A big chunk of that 
wasn’t even obligated. Today, as we 
stand here debating this now, we still 
have a little under $600 billion unspent 
and unobligated. 
So the point I was making to my Re-
publican colleagues during those last 
few weeks in July and those conference 
calls in August was, before we author-
ize any more money, before we further 
mortgage our children’s future, why 
don’t we first repurpose and redirect 
what we already passed because what 
we passed, we passed very quickly be-
cause we had to. We had to do some-
thing massively, and we did something 
massively so that markets wouldn’t 
seize, so that the people—the individ-
uals who were out of work through no 
fault of their own and the businesses 
that were shut down through no fault 
of their own could get financial relief. 
So we came together unanimously, 
and we did that, but doing it fast, 
doing it massively—I certainly knew it 
was going to be far from perfect. We 
found out the Federal Government ac-
tually has a hard time spending $3 tril-
lion because, over the course of a num-
ber of months, they didn’t spend it all. 
They couldn’t even obligate it. 
So what Republicans did during the 
August recess—because we couldn’t 
come to an agreement by the end of 
July—was we worked long and hard on 
a targeted bill, more than $600 billion, 
$300-plus of it for people on unemploy-
ment, $260 billion for small businesses, 
$100 billion for education, and tens of 
billions of dollars for vaccines and test-
ing and agriculture and childcare. We 
offered that on the floor, and 52 Repub-
licans voted to proceed to that bill. 
Democrats just said no. 
I felt it was a crisis, an emergency, 
and we shouldn’t have been turning our 
backs on these people who are suffering 
in September. Democrats said no. All 
they had to do was say yes. They 
couldn’t take yes for an answer. 
Madam President, I often use this 
analogy: I go up to you, because I know 
you are a generous person, and say: 
Madam President, give me 200 bucks. 
And you kind of look at me with a lit-
tle shock and say: Well, I won’t give 
you 200, but I will give you 100. Then I 
go stomping off and say: No; it is $200 
or nothing. 
That is what the Democrats did to 
over $600 billion in needed and nec-
essary relief for the crisis, for the 
emergency, for the people we don’t 
want to turn our backs on because they 
are suffering. If they were really seri-
ous and they actually wanted a result, 
if they wanted to relieve the suffering, 
wouldn’t the logical thing have been to 
say yes, take $600 billion, pocket it, get 
that relief flowing in September, and 
then come back and argue for more? 
But they said no. They were cynical. 
They played politics with it. And that 
is what they are doing here today. 
I am sure, to paraphrase a widely 
known saying, that the road to total 
national bankruptcy is paved with 
good intentions. I am sure that is true. 
I don’t question the good intentions of 
any Member of this body. We all want 
to provide the relief. We all want to re-
lieve suffering. We all want to help fel-
low 
Americans 
who 
are 
hurting 
through no fault of their own. 
But we talk about suffering. We use 
words. We don’t look at numbers very 
often. The Senator from Vermont has 
offered a few numbers, but let me quote 
a couple. Let me just kind of lay it out. 
I didn’t have enough time to do a 
chart, so I will try and go through this 
slowly, but I think it is important to 
put this all in perspective. 
Prior to the COVID recession, we had 
a record number of Americans em-
ployed at the end of December 2019. 
Just under 159 million Americans were 
employed. By April, 2 months into the 
pandemic, 3 months into the pandemic, 
employment had dropped to 133 mil-
lion. That is a loss of over 25 million 
jobs—25 million—which is why we 
acted, why we acted in a bipartisan 
fashion to provide relief for those peo-
ple—25 million—who had lost their 
jobs. 
Now, the good news: It is hard to 
keep the American economy down 
when you don’t overtax, when you 
don’t overregulate. So in November— 
the latest figures we have—there are 
now just shy of 150 million Americans 
employed again. I realize some are un-
deremployed, but still you have 150 
million 
Americans 
employed—down 
about 9 million jobs from that record 
high when unemployment was only 3.5 
percent. We had a record economy be-
cause we stopped overregulating and 
we had a competitive tax system. Now 
the unemployment rate is 6.7 percent. 
In the CARES Act, which I supported 
because I want to help people, part of 
that was the economic impact pay-
ments—basically 
what 
the 
Senator 
from Vermont is proposing here in this 
bill he wants to pass by unanimous 
consent. It spent $274 billion. It was 
paid to just under 166 million Ameri-
cans, for an average check of about 
$1,673 per person. 
You can break that down into house-
holds because, according to the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, the average 
check per household was $2,400. That is 
115 million households that got a 
check—115 million. Now, remember, at 
the low point, 25 million Americans 
had lost their jobs. We sent checks to 
115 million households—41⁄2 times the 
number of people who had lost their 
jobs. 
My problem with the CARES Act, 
with the first four packages, is it was a 
shotgun 
approach. 
We 
just 
spent 
money. We just opened up the spigot, 
and we just sent it all over the place. 
We didn’t have time to target it to 
those who really needed it. As a re-
sult—and we are seeing today—busi-
nesses that needed it, business owners, 
small business owners, have been wiped 
out of their life savings. They didn’t 
get relief. 
It wasn’t well designed. It wasn’t 
well targeted. And we probably spent 
hundreds of billions of dollars and sent 
it to people who didn’t need it. 
We are $27.4 trillion in debt today. 
That is 128 percent of the size of last 
year’s economy. If this bipartisan deal 
goes through, about $1 trillion, we will 
be at $28.4 trillion in debt—132 percent 
of our GDP.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7698 
December 18, 2020 
I remember the good old days when I 
first got here. I ran because we were 
mortgaging our kids’ future. We were a 
little over $14 trillion in debt, and 
when the economy was over $15 tril-
lion, we were under 100 percent debt-to- 
GDP ratio. 
What the Senator from Vermont is 
proposing 
is 
basically 
duplicating, 
without any reforms that I know of, 
those economic impact payments from 
the CARES Act, another $275 billion, 
for a total of $550 billion—a half a tril-
lion dollars sent out again to 115 mil-
lion households when right now we 
have only—not ‘‘only,’’ this is tragic. 
Every job lost is a tragedy. But we 
have 9 million jobs less than we had 
when we had a record level of employ-
ment before the recession—9 million 
jobs lost, 115 million households. That 
is 12.6 times the number of jobs that 
have been lost. 
I think the question needs to be, if 
we are going do this again, is there any 
sense, any information in terms of how 
the $275 billion is spent? Well, we have 
an answer from the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York. They do a monthly 
internet-based survey called the Sur-
vey of Consumer Expectation. They did 
two special surveys, one in June and 
one in August. The June survey took a 
look at how those households spent the 
$2,400 checks. Here are the results: 18 
percent of those checks were spent on 
essential 
consumption—essential; 
8 
percent was on nonessential, the fun 
stuff, I guess; 3 percent on donations— 
Americans are still generous—for a 
total of 29 percent spent on consump-
tion. The marginal propensity to con-
sume was 29 percent. For the remain-
der, 71 percent, half of it was put to 
savings—spent on increasing savings— 
and the other half was paying off debt. 
They also studied how the unemploy-
ment plus-up was spent. It had pretty 
similar results: 24 percent of those dol-
lars went for essential consumer goods; 
4 percent, non-essential; 1 percent, do-
nations. Again, a total of 29 percent 
was consumed; 71 percent was either 
saved or used for debt reduction. 
They did another special survey in 
August, asking those same 1,300 house-
holds that they surveyed: How would 
you spend a $1,500 check? Not $2,400— 
$1,500. The response was that 14 percent 
would be spent on essential items, 7 
percent on nonessential, 3 percent on 
donations. But only 24 percent of a new 
check would actually be spent on con-
sumption; 76 percent would either be 
saved or pay off debt. 
That is not very good economic stim-
ulus. Again, the numbers are without 
any reforms, without trying to target 
the dollars to people who really need 
it. I would want to do that. I would like 
to work with anybody to try and get 
that relief flowing as quickly as pos-
sible to get it to the individuals who 
need it. I am sure the need is still 
great. It is greater than 9 million. I un-
derstand that. But let’s look at some 
figures. 
I do want to point out a past stim-
ulus in terms of its effectiveness. In 
2009, we had the great recession. Let 
me quote some employment figures 
from that. 
In January 2008, we had 146 million 
Americans 
employed. 
Remember, 
today we have 149 million. Our record 
was 159 million, but there were about 
146 million before the great recession. 
By December 2009, it had dropped, hit 
the low point of 138 million people 
working; 8 million people had lost their 
jobs. 
In January, 2009, President Obama 
was inaugurated, had total control of 
government, a filibuster-proof Senate, 
control of the House. He could pass 
anything he wanted, and they did. 
They passed the $787 billion American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009. They did that in February 2009. At 
that point, there were 141.6 million 
Americans 
working—141.6 
million 
Americans. The unemployment rate 
was 8.3 percent. Again, throughout 
2009, that stimulus didn’t work too well 
because unemployment fell to 138 mil-
lion Americans. It took 3 years—3 
years—until January 2012, because of 
overregulation and overtaxation, to re-
turn to February 2009 levels of 141.6 
million Americans working—3 years. 
That is what we call a slow, non-
existent recovery. 
Oh, a quick aside: The Senator from 
Vermont is talking about how we need 
the $600 plus-up for the unemployed be-
cause they are suffering. President 
Obama, with Speaker PELOSI and Ma-
jority Leader Reid, with a filibuster- 
proof Senate—they provided a $25-per- 
week plus-up to State unemployment 
when they had total control. Now they 
are demanding $600. I know that is not 
part of what the Senator from Vermont 
is asking for in terms of a unanimous 
consent request. I thought it was just 
somewhat noteworthy. 
Again, I am not heartless. I want to 
help people. I voted to help people. I 
voted for the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, 
but I also am concerned about our chil-
dren’s future and the fact that we are 
mortgaging it. We do not have an un-
limited checking account. We have to 
be concerned about these things. 
My complaint about the Senator 
from Vermont’s bill—and, quite hon-
estly, the bipartisan effort—we have 
$600 billion unspent, unobligated. Let’s 
work long and hard. Let’s look at eco-
nomic data. Let’s target it properly. 
Let’s not just shotgun it out to the 
economy again, wasting tens, if not 
hundreds of billions of dollars. Let’s 
focus on that. Let’s pretend it is like 
real money—like it is our money—and 
spend it well. We don’t need to mort-
gage our children’s future by another 
$300 or $400 billion. We don’t need to do 
that. 
We can alleviate suffering. We can 
help our fellow Americans. We could 
have done it in September, but the 
good Senator from Vermont and all of 
his colleagues on the Democratic side 
simply won’t take yes for an answer, 
and my guess is, they are taking that 
same stance today. So, Madam Presi-
dent, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
the Senator from Wisconsin talks 
about Democrats not taking yes for an 
answer. Let me tell you what we did 
not take for an answer. We did not 
take for an answer the Republican bill, 
which did not have a nickel for unem-
ployment benefits. We did not take yes 
for an answer for a bill that did not 
have a nickel for direct payments. 
The Senator from Wisconsin talks 
about the deficit. Yet the Senator from 
Wisconsin voted for over $1 trillion in 
tax breaks for billionaires and large, 
profitable corporations. That is OK. 
The Senator from Wisconsin voted 
for a bloated military budget, $740 bil-
lion. That is OK. 
The Senator from Wisconsin supports 
hundreds and hundreds of billions of 
dollars in corporate welfare. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin threw out some 
numbers. Let me throw out some other 
numbers. Half of the people in this 
country are living paycheck to pay-
check. Millions of workers are trying 
to survive on starvation wages of 10 or 
12 bucks an hour. Ninety million people 
are uninsured or underinsured, can’t 
afford to go to a doctor. Nineteen mil-
lion families are spending half of their 
limited incomes on housing. 
Today, we have the most severe hun-
ger crisis in America that we have had 
in decades. Children in this country are 
going hungry while half a million peo-
ple are homeless and many millions 
more fear eviction. 
Today, as a result of the pandemic, 
not 
only 
do 
we 
have 
the 
worst 
healthcare crisis in 100 years but the 
worst economic crisis since the Great 
Depression. 
I say to my colleague from Wis-
consin, yes—I will not support pro-
posals that do not provide a nickel in 
unemployment benefits, not a nickel in 
direct relief to tens of millions of low- 
income and middle-income families. 
I would hope very much that this 
Congress appreciates the pain that is 
out there and that instead of worrying 
about tax breaks for billionaires or cor-
porate welfare, let’s pay attention to 
the needs of working families, and let 
us pass legislation which includes 
$1,200 direct payments to working class 
families, as we did in the CARES Act, 
500 bucks to their kids, and certainly 
not taking a nickel away from unem-
ployment and the other important pro-
visions that are currently being nego-
tiated. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, to 
my colleague from Vermont, my under-
standing is that in a room somewhere 
near here right now, those negotiations 
are ongoing, and there certainly better 
be unemployment insurance. That was 
in our bipartisan framework that I 
worked with the Presiding Officer on. 
And there certainly better be not just 
an extension of the existing Federal as-
sistance for self-employed workers and

gig economy workers and for those who 
are now benefiting from the Federal 
extension, the 13-week extension, but 
also additional funding. My under-
standing is direct payments are also in 
the mix. 
I just wish they would get their work 
done. It has been 9 months since the 
CARES Act was done. I just hope we 
can figure out a way to get through the 
hurdles that remain. I have spent much 
of the day—as have my colleagues, I 
am sure—talking to colleagues, trying 
to figure out how to fix the last couple 
of issues that apparently are out there. 
But my hope is that even if it is not a 
perfect bill for me—and it won’t be. I 
know it won’t be. We spent 3 or 4 weeks 
working on legislation that is bipar-
tisan that isn’t what any of us would 
have crafted individually, but it pro-
vides that needed help right now. We 
need it both for the economic crisis 
that has been caused by this virus but 
also the healthcare crisis, which, un-
fortunately, is getting worse in my 
home State of Ohio and not better. 
The vaccine is on its way. That is 
very exciting. I believe that the vac-
cine development and now the distribu-
tion are actually quite impressive. I 
think 
the 
administration 
deserves 
credit for that, as do so many hard- 
working 
scientists 
who 
have 
been 
sleeping in their offices, making sure 
that we have this vaccine available. 
But there is going to be a bridge here. 
There is a time period between now and 
March and April when it is not going to 
be readily available to everybody we 
represent. During that time period, we 
need a bridge. We have needed it for a 
while, so my hope is we will get that 
done tonight. 
TRIBUTE TO TERESA SIMMS 
Madam President, I also want to 
mention briefly, I just came in on the 
underground subway from the offices 
and ran into a woman who has spent 41 
years working here for us—one of those 
selfless, hard-working employees of the 
United States Capitol. Her name is Te-
resa Simms. Many of you know Teresa. 
She always has a smile on her face. She 
is always optimistic. She always has a 
focus on providing the best service to 
all of us—staff, other employees, Mem-
bers. She started in the cafeteria. She 
then went to the night cleaning crew, 
cleaning offices here in this place at 
night. And then she was promoted to 
being one of the drivers of the subway. 
For 41 years, again, she has done that 
job dutifully, with great commitment. 
She is going to retire and spend more 
time with her family and, particularly, 
take care of her mom, who is ill. To-
night we want to offer our thanks and 
gratitude to her and our best wishes to 
her in retirement. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
The other thing that is going on to-
night—I will say, I guess it is obvious— 
is that we are about to hit the govern-
ment shutdown time period again. I 
mean, we are only about 61⁄2 half hours 
from another government shutdown. 
That 
is 
totally 
unacceptable. 
We 
should never have these shutdowns. 
They don’t make any sense. By the 
way, to my Republican friends who 
think these shutdowns are good be-
cause you shut down a lot of govern-
ment, and it seems like you would save 
money—we never save money. The tax-
payers always pay more. You go back 
and provide backpay even for services 
that aren’t provided. 
I think we have to figure out a way, 
when we can’t get our work done here— 
and that is why this is happening. We 
have not gotten our spending bills, ap-
propriations done here. Therefore, we 
are facing a government shutdown 
again. At midnight, we turn into pump-
kins. It means the government starts 
to get shut down. 
By the way, it creates confusion and 
uncertainty for Federal workers, of 
course, who are wondering, are they 
going to have their job and are they 
going to get paid, but also confusion 
and uncertainty for a lot of citizens 
who are depending on the services that 
would otherwise be provided. It is so 
inefficient. If you believe in the effi-
ciency of government and you believe 
in, you know, not wasting money, you 
shouldn’t want these government shut-
downs. 
My hope is that we do pass a con-
tinuing resolution at least to kick us 
into the next couple of days so that we 
don’t have a shutdown tonight. That 
would be such a disaster for so many 
people. And it could last a long time, 
by the way, as these shutdowns did 
over the last couple of years. It doesn’t 
just mean it is a few days. Let’s just 
not go into shutdown at all. 
I have introduced legislation called 
End Government Shutdowns for 10 
years now. I have introduced it in five 
different Congresses. We have 33 co-
sponsors. I think it has more cospon-
sors than any other bill like it, but 
there are other ideas out there, and I 
am open to them—just some way to get 
away from these shutdowns. Our bill 
says you just can’t shut it down. When 
you are going for a shutdown, instead, 
you just do a continuing funding from 
the previous year. And then, by the 
way, over time, you reduce that by 1 
percent every 90 days and every 60 days 
to get the attention of the appropri-
ators to get them back to work. Other 
people have other ideas. Our bill has 
been bipartisan in the past. I don’t be-
lieve it is today, but it does have 33 co-
sponsors. 
My hope is that we can figure out a 
way to end these government shut-
downs with simple legislation that 
says: Let’s just not do it. I don’t think 
it provides healthy leverage. I think it 
provides, again, uncertainty and confu-
sion. 
CYBER SECURITY 
Madam President, 2020 has been a 
tough year, let’s face it. And, unfortu-
nately, it looks like the challenges 
haven’t ended. I came to the floor to-
night, primarily, to talk about some 
shocking and disturbing news we just 
heard over the last few days, and that 
is that there has been a massive, high-
ly sophisticated, and ongoing cyber at-
tack that has compromised the net-
works of multiple Federal agencies and 
the private sector. 
According to reports, for months 
now—months—hackers—our 
intel-
ligence experts think they are most 
likely connected with the Russian Gov-
ernment in some way. That is what 
they tell us. But these hackers have 
engaged in an espionage effort to ac-
cess information in some of our biggest 
Federal agencies that hold some of our 
most sensitive data and our most sen-
sitive and important national security 
secrets. 
Also, again, many U.S. private com-
panies were hacked, as well. These 
hackers are smart. They targeted some 
of these agencies that do handle things 
like national security—the State De-
partment, for instance, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, the De-
partment of Energy and its Nuclear Se-
curity Administration. 
This is scary stuff. Others, like the 
National Institutes of Health, were 
hacked. Of course, they are closely in-
volved with our work to respond to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, so also a lot of im-
portant, sensitive information could 
have been hacked. They are a treasure 
trove of information. These are agen-
cies that protect our homeland, pro-
mote our freedom abroad, and are on 
the frontlines battling this pandemic. 
But what we know today may be just 
the tip of the iceberg, we are told. Ex-
perts expect the number of agencies as 
well as a number of private companies 
victimized by this attack will only con-
tinue to grow. 
The main IT monitoring platform be-
lieved to have been hacked was used 
across the government and by 33,000 
private companies. Shockingly, we also 
know that FireEye, the preeminent 
cyber incident response firm, was also 
breached. So think about this. FireEye, 
which is a company that people call 
when they are hacked, was hacked. 
We are still learning the details 
about this attack, but what we know is 
chilling. Federal investigators from 
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, CISA, under the De-
partment of Homeland Security, the 
FBI, and also the Office of National In-
telligence, the ODNI, are all working 
to determine how this happened, what 
the extent of it is. 
But it looks like the main vulnera-
bility was through a SolarWinds’ plat-
form, which is an IT monitoring plat-
form widely, again, widely used by the 
government and the private sector to 
oversee the operation of other com-
puter networks. 
The hackers disguised their entry 
into these Federal agencies and com-
pany systems in a troubling and clever 
way. They exploited a vulnerability in 
a 
security 
patch 
sent 
out 
by 
SolarWinds to update its software. I 
want to emphasize that—the security 
patches that we all advocate to be in-
stalled as soon as possible to protect

our networks as basic good cyber hy-
giene was actually a security breach. 
This technique and the breadth of 
this hack are both unprecedented, and 
it shows that the Federal Government 
is still far from where we need to be to 
handle the cyber security challenges of 
the 21st century. 
As the Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations said in its investigation 
and report, these alarms that we have 
been raising over time are ones that we 
should have paid attention to. In 2019, 
last summer, Senator CARPER and I 
issued a shocking report that detailed 
the unacceptable cyber security vul-
nerabilities in the Federal Govern-
ment—vulnerabilities that may very 
well have played a role in the extent of 
this breach. 
Our report looked back at how well 
Federal agencies complied with basic 
cyber security standards over the past 
decade. Every agency we reviewed 
failed. And we know that four of those 
agencies—the Department of Homeland 
Security, the State Department, the 
Department of Agriculture, the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services— 
are 
among 
those 
that 
have 
been 
breached in this current cyber attack. 
That report from the Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations made 
clear that Federal agencies were a tar-
get for cyber criminals and other na-
tion-state adversaries. In 2017 alone, 
Federal agencies reported 35,277 cyber 
incidents. It is the most recent data we 
have—in 1 year. The number of cyber 
incidents in 2019 was a little bit less, 
28,581. But 2020 will bring what is likely 
the 
biggest, 
most 
comprehensive 
breach across the Federal Government 
in our history. 
We also found we are not equipped to 
handle this threat. Many of the agen-
cies we reviewed didn’t even know 
what applications and platforms were 
operating on its systems. That begs the 
question: How can you protect some-
thing if you don’t even know what you 
need to protect? 
If Federal agencies fail at meeting 
basic cyber standards, there is no way 
they are equipped to thwart the kind of 
sophisticated attack that apparently 
happened over the past several months. 
Here, the attackers were meticulous 
and had a detailed understanding of 
how to evade intrusion detection prac-
tices and technologies. And because the 
Federal agencies involved were unpre-
pared, the attackers had ample time to 
cover their tracks, which means evalu-
ating the extent of the damage and 
kicking them off our networks is going 
to be incredibly difficult and time-con-
suming. 
Given how widespread this attack is 
and how much wider it is expected to 
become, it certainly seems like the 
Federal Government’s current cyber 
resources are going to be spread incred-
ibly thin. 
Congress and the executive branch 
have failed to prioritize cyber security, 
and now we find ourselves vulnerable 
and exposed. We have to do better than 
this. This breach has to be a wake-up 
call for all of us. 
Over the years, I have worked across 
the aisle with Senator PETERS, Senator 
CORNYN, Senator HASSAN, and others 
on legislation to beef up our Federal 
Government cyber capacities, includ-
ing the Risk-Informed Spending for Cy-
bersecurity Act, the Federal System 
Incident Response Act, and the DHS 
Cyber Hunt and Incident Response 
Team Act, and others. We are proud of 
this legislation. 
Let’s be honest. It wasn’t enough. We 
need to do more. We need to not only 
defend our networks but go on the of-
fense to defer a nation-state, like Rus-
sia, and nonstate actors from even con-
sidering a future attack like this. That 
means there needs to be consequences 
for cyber attacks significant enough to 
prevent them from happening again 
and a willingness to act preemptively 
when warranted. 
Congress has to take a hard look at 
the cyber security capabilities of our 
Federal agencies. In the next Congress, 
I will be the top Republican on the 
Senate Homeland Security and Govern-
mental 
Affairs 
Committee, 
which 
means I will either serve as its chair-
man or ranking member, depending on 
the outcome of a couple of races in 
Georgia. Senator PETERS will be the 
chair if the Democrats take the major-
ity. I will tell you here tonight, wheth-
er I am chairman in January or him, 
we intend to hold indepth hearings on 
cyber security. With what has hap-
pened, we will also, of course, focus on 
the origin, scope, and severity of this 
breach. 
Actually, 3 weeks ago, even before 
this attack was revealed, we met and 
decided to hold these cyber security 
hearings, and we are already working 
on comprehensive legislation to im-
prove our cyber defenses in the Federal 
Government going forward. 
We must now move with a renewed 
sense of purpose and urgency to learn 
from this massive attack. We have to 
remove these hackers from these sys-
tems and put in place protections to 
prevent it from happening again. 
As this cyber attack has made clear, 
we have to redouble our efforts to 
shore up our defenses. We are two dec-
ades into the 21st century, but most of 
the Federal Government legacy com-
puter systems are from the 20th cen-
tury. Federal agencies are simply be-
hind the times when it comes to de-
fending 
themselves 
against 
these 
threats posed in cyber space. The gov-
ernment is trying to respond to sophis-
ticated, 21st century attacks with 20th 
century defenses. This attack has 
shown us the consequences of that and 
should be the catalyst for real bipar-
tisan action here in the next Congress 
to better defend networks that contain 
sensitive, personal information, and 
other information critical to our econ-
omy, our healthcare, and the safety 
and security of all Americans. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER

Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The

OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, before I 
give my remarks, I would like to say 
that I hope the rumors are true that we 
are getting close to a deal here. The 
country needs us to reach a bipartisan 
deal, as we did in March, unanimously, 
when we passed the CARES Act here. 
It is time for us to do that again. In 
Colorado and all across the country 
cases are spiking and the economy is 
slowing down. People need relief. They 
need help. I hope we will come together 
in a bipartisan way and do that. 
I hope that the deal is not going to 
come crashing down because of a dis-
agreement about what the Federal Re-
serve’s authority ought to be under the 
13(3) program. That is an important 
program for the Federal Reserve to 
help when things are really distressed 
in our economy—to help our small 
businesses, our State and local govern-
ments, and working families all over 
this country. 
It is an authority that Donald Trump 
used—or that the Fed used while Don-
ald Trump was President. People on 
both sides of the aisle said it was an ef-
fective authority, and if it is an effec-
tive authority for President Trump, it 
should not be taken away from the 
Federal Reserve just because Joe Biden 
is becoming President of the United 
States. 
So I hope that we will come to an 
agreement. I expect that we will. I 
hope it is soon. People need the help. 
CYBER SECURITY 
Mr. President, in the last few days we 
have learned that the United States 
was subject to one of the most brazen 
cyber hacks in history. Based on press 
reports alone, the hackers appear to 
have 
breached 
the 
Department 
of 
State, the Department of Commerce, 
the Department of Energy, the Depart-
ment of the Treasury, the National Nu-
clear Security Agency, and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security—including 
the agency responsible for our cyber se-
curity. 
On top of that, the hackers also man-
aged to breach major American compa-
nies like Microsoft and compromised 
several State governments and other 
foreign governments all at the same 
time in this process. 
While we are learning more about 
these breaches, the level of resources 
and sophistication bears all the hall-
marks of Russia. Reports suggest that 
the hackers have been in the system 
since the spring and perhaps much 
longer. According to public reports, 
they may still be in our system to-
night.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7701 
December 18, 2020 
We have heard literally not a word 
from the White House about this, not a 
single word from the President about 
this. I suppose this should come as no 
surprise. After all, this is the same 
President who, to this day, refuses to 
acknowledge that the Russians inter-
fered in our 2016 election even though 
our intelligence agencies unanimously 
agree that Russia meddled. 
This is the same President who went 
to Helsinki and, on foreign soil, sided 
with 
Russian 
President 
Vladimir 
Putin, a former KGB officer, over the 
CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and all of our 
other intelligence organizations. 
The same President who spends the 
lion’s share of almost every day criti-
cizing everyone from the National 
Football League to Greta Thunberg, 
who is 17 years old, to the Secretary of 
State in Georgia for upholding the rule 
of law can’t bring himself to utter one 
word of criticism for Vladimir Putin— 
the same President who, instead of 
challenging Putin, proposed creating a 
joint cyber unit between the United 
States and Russia. That would be like 
asking a burglar to design the locks on 
the front door of your house. 
The Trump administration is not 
known for its consistency, but here is 
the one place they have been resolute 
and consistently weak, coddling dic-
tators and abandoning our democratic 
allies. 
As a member of the Intelligence 
Committee, I can’t say for sure today 
whether this weakness emboldened or 
enabled our adversaries. We are going 
to have to study the facts. But the ad-
ministration’s abject fecklessness cer-
tainly hasn’t helped. 
To understand how weak the Trump 
administration has left us, it is impor-
tant to appreciate the wreckage of 
their total war on the Federal Govern-
ment. They came into office with a 
promise to dismantle ‘‘the administra-
tive state,’’ but what they ended up 
doing was dismantling our national de-
fenses. 
Over the past 4 years, the adminis-
tration drove thousands of qualified 
public servants to the exit, including 
cyber security experts in agency after 
agency critical to our national secu-
rity. 
Back in March, I asked the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to detail 
its plans to shore up our cyber secu-
rity. They responded by telling me that 
they still had hundreds of vacancies for 
cyber security. 
President Trump eliminated the top 
coordinator for cyber security at the 
National Security Council. There is no 
one, therefore, coordinating our cyber 
defenses across the Federal Govern-
ment or engaging the private sector to 
make sure we are working together to 
shore up those vulnerabilities. 
If you put it all together, we have 
been left with a gutted bureaucracy 
without the necessary leadership to re-
spond to cyber threats and espionage in 
a coherent way. And a few weeks ago, 
the President fired Chris Krebs, just to 
make matters worse, our top Depart-
ment of Homeland Security official for 
domestic cyber security—the very per-
son who would be leading our response 
to the hacks right now. 
But he is gone. He is gone not be-
cause he did a bad job but because he 
refused to repeat the President’s base-
less claims about fraud in the election, 
claims the President is still making as 
we meet here tonight more than 6 
weeks after the election and 4 days 
after the electoral college confirmed 
Joe Biden’s election. 
In the last few days alone, the Presi-
dent has tweeted at least 25 times 
about fraud in the 2020 election, some-
thing he has completely invented in his 
mind, but he hasn’t said one word 
about the most far-reaching breach of 
cyber security in our history by a for-
eign adversary. 
As we meet here again tonight in the 
land of flickering lights, uncertain 
whether we will pass a budget to keep 
the lights on in our exercise of self-gov-
ernment for the weekend, all across the 
globe there are public servants, the 
men and women of our intelligence 
services, who are working to repair the 
damage that has been done and to keep 
us safe. They deserve and the American 
people deserve a President who makes 
clear that we won’t tolerate intrusions 
like this, a President who rallies our 
allies to our common cause. 
If we have learned anything this 
year, it is that our government has 
proven itself woefully unprepared to 
deal with emerging threats, not only a 
cyber attack but also a global pan-
demic. This year has also taught us 
that the cost of ignoring these threats 
is much, much greater than the cost of 
addressing them head-on. 
But to do that we need a President 
who doesn’t bury his head in the sand 
or his face in Twitter, a democracy 
that can think beyond the next com-
mercial break on cable news, that can 
put aside festering partisanship and 
forge an enduring national security 
policy for the 21st century. 
And Russia is not our only concern. I 
can assure you that China is not chas-
ing the latest controversy on Twitter 
or cable news. They are building roads 
and bridges and airports across the 
globe. They are laying fiber-optic ca-
bles beneath the ocean. They are com-
peting with us in space. They are forg-
ing new alliances and pioneering new 
technologies every month. They are 
making considered choices to shape the 
21st century while we are struggling 
here to keep the lights on. 
This lack of concern from the White 
House about this breach is a dark mo-
ment, but soon we will have the chance 
to take another approach. I hope every-
one in this Chamber will seize the op-
portunity to work with one another to 
secure the promise of our great coun-
try for the next generation and Amer-
ica’s role in the world.

Both sides of the aisle are firmly 
committed to finalizing another major 
pandemic rescue package for the Amer-

been underway for several days now. 
As of right now, we have not yet 
reached a final agreement, regretfully. 
I believe all sides feel we are making 
good progress on a major relief bill 
that would travel with a full-year ap-
propriations measure. 
But, alas, we are not there yet. 
Given that, our urgent task is to pass 
a stopgap government funding meas-
ure. There is no reason the Federal 
Government funding should lapse while 
we hammer out our remaining dif-
ferences. We are going to take up the 
continuing 
resolution, 
which 
just 
passed the House a few minutes ago on 
an overwhelming bipartisan basis. 
I hope this body will pass it easily 
and get this measure on the President’s 
desk so Congress can complete our ne-
gotiations with no pointless lapse in 
normal government operations.

December 18, 2020 
TRIBUTE TO TODD RUCKEL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, at 
the end of last month, my friend Todd 
Ruckel closed out 8 impressive years of 
leadership as Lewis County judge-exec-
utive. This financial consultant turned 
public servant has given so much to his 
community. I would like to take a mo-
ment today to join Todd’s admirers in 
thanking him for his service. 
As a former county judge-executive 
myself, I know just how close Todd is 
with his constituents. He hears their 
stories and has been instrumental in 
Lewis County’s success. It is a difficult 
assignment but one with many rewards 
for a job well done. Todd ends his time 
in office with the respect of his col-
leagues and the gratitude of the fami-
lies he served so well. He was even 
named the Kentucky Emergency Man-
agement Judge-Executive of the Year 
in 2017 for his work to keep his commu-
nity safe. 
My team and I have worked with 
Todd over the years. In particular, we 
secured over $1 million from the Appa-
lachian Regional Commission to up-
grade the water infrastructure in Lewis 
County. It is just a snapshot of Todd’s 
accomplishments for the families who 
placed their trust in him. 
Unfortunately, the pain caused by 
the coronavirus this past year has led 
to many challenges for local officials 
and communities. Todd recognized the 
danger early on. He took steps to pro-
tect families throughout Lewis County. 
I am proud the CARES Act delivered 
more than $2 million to the commu-
nity, including to support Todd’s team. 
Although the transition has begun 
toward new leadership in Lewis Coun-
ty, Todd is still working for Kentucky. 
He is joining the Kentucky County 
Judge-Executive Association as its new 
executive director. Now, Todd can use 
his talents to help local officials in 
communities 
across 
the 
Bluegrass 
State. 
I am sure everyone in the Lewis 
County courthouse is sad to see Todd 
and his wife Sandy go, but the results 
of his leadership will remain. On behalf 
of the Senate, I am grateful for Todd’s 
continued service to Kentucky. We ex-
tend our best wishes and congratulate 
him on an accomplished career for Ken-
tucky. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BOB HUTCHISON 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
over the course of 40-plus years, my 
friend Bob Hutchison and his brother 
Tom built an impressive network of 
restaurant franchises in Eastern Ken-
tucky. The brothers employed thou-
sands of Kentuckians, believing a firm 
commitment 
to 
their 
community 
would bring success. They were right. 
Bob and Tom recently announced the 
sale of their 13 McDonald’s franchises 
to pursue new opportunities. On behalf 
of the families across the region who 
continue to benefit from their entre-
preneurial investment, I would like to 
congratulate the brothers on their 
great achievement. 
While many folks are lucky enough 
to be born in Kentucky, some find their 
way to the Bluegrass State. As the 
Hutchison brothers scouted across the 
region for the right place to open their 
first restaurant, Bob saw something 
special in Paintsville. I think they 
found a wonderful community. 
They decided to open their store dur-
ing the local festival called Apple 
Days. Some onlookers were skeptical 
the Hutchison brothers could be pre-
pared for a successful opening during 
such a high-traffic event. Bob and Tom 
were undeterred. To put their best foot 
forward, they trained staff to flip 
Styrofoam patties in their living room 
as they prepared for the big day. When 
the restaurant opened on October 6, 
1979, they surpassed all expectations. I 
have visited them during the Apple 
Days festival through the years as 
their restaurant continued to thrive. 
Together, the brothers developed a 
recipe that worked. Their first res-
taurant connected with customers, and 
they continued opening more fran-
chises around the region. At each of 
their 13 restaurants, Bob and Tom 
made a commitment to investing in 
their employees and community. They 
gave many young people their first job, 
instilling the values of hard work and 
dedication. Scores of Kentuckians have 
grown up and achieved because of the 
brothers’ influence. In addition to the 
McDonald’s 
restaurants, 
Bob 
also 
founded the HUTCH Auto Group and a 
gasket and supply company in Ohio. 
I had the privilege to become friends 
with Bob as he grew more active in the 
community. 
He 
has 
promoted 
our 
shared values and made extraordinary 
contributions to a wide range of orga-
nizations, including the University of 
Pikeville, the Christian Appalachian 
Project, and the Boy Scouts of Eastern 
Kentucky. Working more than 20 years 
with the Paintsville/Johnson County 
Tourism Commission, Bob has helped 
others see the great beauty and poten-
tial of this community in the same way 
he did all those years ago. 
Although Bob and Tom are stepping 
away from their restaurants, they will 
keep working for Eastern Kentucky’s 
future. I am grateful to the Hutchison 
brothers for their inspiring achieve-
ments. Whatever the future holds in 
store for them, I wish them the very 
best. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
Appalachian 
News-Express published a profile on the 
Hutchison brothers’ inspiring career in 
Eastern Kentucky. I ask unanimous 
consent the article be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

BOB
AND
TOM 
HUTCHISON PART WAYS WITH MCDONALD’S 
STORES 
(By Reagan Coburn) 
PAINTSVILLE—Bob and Tom Hutchison, 
brothers and owner-operators of 13 McDon-
ald’s restaurants in Eastern Kentucky, re-
cently announced that they have sold their 
franchise to Faris Enterprises of Clinton, 
Tennessee. Tom described the joint decision 
of the two brothers, stating, ‘‘The time has 
come to turn over the spatula to the next op-
portunity.’’ 
The Hutchison brothers’ journey led them 
from Ohio to the mountains of Eastern Ken-
tucky. Along the way they made numerous 
contributions to the area through their res-
taurants, and have given back to the com-
munities in which they have engrained their 
lives. 
The two youngest of five brothers, Bob and 
Tom were raised by parents who instilled 
values and beliefs in them to which they 
credit their successes in life. 
‘‘Our Dad had a full ride of a career,’’ said 
Tom. ‘‘He had been in the restaurant busi-
ness and was with McDonald’s. He worked for 
this group of investors. He pretty much re-
tired, but when he went to McDonald’s they 
knew that we were going to use our father’s 
brain and brawn. The gentleman who was 
running McDonald’s in that division at the 
time knew our work ethic. He’s the one that 
kept pushing us to come to Kentucky. 
‘‘At that time I was 22, Bob was 25,’’ Tom 
continued. ‘‘The youngest franchisees signed 
on. That was unheard of. But the guy knew 
our work ethic from our parents. Our father 
grew up in an orphanage from the age of five 
until he got out until he got out to marry 
our mother. A single mother raised our 
mother after the age of 12. Her father had an 
early death. So both of our parents were very 
goal-oriented, stern, family-based and those 
values were how we were raised.’’ 
Tom described the duo as being business 
partners even as young children cutting 
grass, shoveling driveways in the Ohio win-
ters and washing and waxing cars. They 
began working from a very young age. From 
the age of 9 to 14, Bob delivered newspapers. 
At the age of 14, both brothers entered the 
restaurant business with the assistance of 
their father. 
‘‘We knew the restaurant business,’’ stated 
Tom. ‘‘We started at 14 years old. We did 
management and I got into marketing. Bob 
did some schooling. The fact is that we knew 
how to run a restaurant and that it was 
about people—powering our people with 
pride. That is what we made as a foundation 
for building our company.’’ 
GETTING STARTED IN EASTERN KENTUCKY 
Making the choice to settle in Eastern 
Kentucky and open a McDonald’s restaurant 
in a community like Paintsville in the 1970s 
and 1980s did not come without some reserva-
tions and a few obstacles along the way. 
‘‘We had several places to go to,’’ described 
Bob. ‘‘Our dad had just retired working with 
McDonald’s—another operator. Then one of 
his cohorts tried to get him involved with 
the restaurants and there was no way that 
we could do that because we had no cash of 
that means. A fella from McDonald’s was 
very encouraging to Dad about getting into 
the restaurant franchise. They said, ‘You 
gotta get a McDonald’s.’ ’’ 
‘‘So we came to the conclusion that we can 
try it, even though we knew we had a short 
falling of cash.’’ Bob said that his father’s 
cohort stated, ‘‘There’s this little spot in 
East Kentucky called Paintsville. We want 
you to go look at that.’’ 
Bob continued, ‘‘Mom, Dad, Tom and I 
came to Paintsville at the McDonald’s rec-
ommendation. Mom and Tom weren’t really 
on fire in the beginning because it was rain-
ing, a two lane road and lots of coal trucks. 
So we went back and said, ‘Aren’t there any 
other areas?’ So we went back and looked at 
three or four other spots in the Ohio area, 
but for one reason or another, we gravitated 
back here.’’

The family returned to Paintsville once 
again to give the area a second consideration 
to establish their restaurant. 
Bob stated that he loved the area because 
of the many state parks that were within an 
hour or so of the town. 
‘‘I thought that’s the place we need to be. 
You’ve got the Daniel Boone National For-
est, you’ve got the Red River Gorge, you’ve 
got Fishtrap, you’ve got Dewey (Jenny 
Wiley). This place was rocking with that 
kind of stuff,’’ Bob explained. 
During their second visit to Paintsville 
they stayed in the Heart O’ Highland’s 
Motel, one of two motels in the town at the 
time. The family received a knock on the 
door of their room by a staff member stating 
they had to leave because the dam at 
Paintsville Lake was going to break, a his-
toric moment for many in the area during 
1978, and that they must evacuate the town. 
‘‘Mom said that’s an omen, we don’t need 
to be here,’’ stated Bob. 
‘‘I was already in the car,’’ Tom joked. 
After that debacle, the family once again 
looked for other locations and stores but 
they were repeatedly told by their advisor 
that Paintsville was ‘‘where it’s at.’’ 
‘‘So we came back, but we didn’t have the 
money. We needed $250,000,’’ Bob said. ‘‘The 
next trip was come back with our newly-pur-
chased dress suits and went to the bank. We 
went to First National Bank and the vice 
president was very cordial. We sat down and 
told him we need $250,000 and we want to put 
in a McDonald’s. We knew we were in trouble 
when he said, ‘What’s a McDonald’s?’ ’’ So we 
presented a packet to him of what McDon-
ald’s was.’’ After about 15 minutes of delib-
eration, the Vice President of the bank of-
fered them a mere $25,000. 
Bob stated, ‘‘We walked out of the bank. 
Dad was a chain smoker. He lit a cigarette 
and as we walked down the street toward the 
car Mom said, ‘No luck there. I can tell by 
the way you’re walking and smoking.’ ’’ 
Bob said that was the moment when his 
mother made the switch from pessimist to 
optimist. 
According to Bob, she said, ‘‘Now look, 
there’s another bank down there. You guys 
go down there and find some money.’’ 
‘‘So we went down to Citizen’s National 
Bank and were greeted by a very hospitable 
lady, Nancy Brugh, and we told her what we 
were looking for,’’ Bob explained. 
Brugh seated the boys in the office of Trigg 
Dorton, an famous local banker during the 
time. Describing Dorton, Bob stated, ‘‘He 
had his three-piece suit, his glasses and a 
cigar and introduced himself and sat down.’’ 
Dorton allegedly said, ‘‘Boys, tell me about 
yourself. He started with Tom. He said, ‘go 
back as far as you can remember. Tell me 
about your life,’ ’’ Bob stated. 
Dorton then asked Bob and his father to do 
the same. 
Bob stated that Dorton was incredibly im-
pressed with their life stories and that 
Dorton and his father shared a common link- 
they were both in the Second World War. 
‘‘It was the very first time I heard Dad say 
anything remotely about the war,’’ said Bob. 
He continued, ‘‘He was also impressed that 
Dad was raised in a children’s home. He was 
impressed that Tom and I started working 
when we were fourteen.’’ 
The following day, Dorton presented the 
family with a check for $250,000. 
‘‘He was probably the most knowledgeable 
banker I ever met,’’ said Bob. ‘‘Then, of 
course, his son Dennis Dorton, who just 
passed, was my second mentor there.’’ 
They opened a bank account there, depos-
ited the check, and that was the beginning. 
Choosing to stay 
Tom stated, ‘‘By the fall of 1978 we knew 
we were coming. We broke ground that win-
ter and were open by the fall of 1979.’’ 
He continued, ‘‘We opened up on Apple 
Days—right in the swing of things. McDon-
ald’s came in and said there’s no way you 
guys can handle opening during the festival. 
We were doing trainings in our living rooms 
with Styrofoam hamburgers. We were teach-
ing them service. We had nowhere to train 
them,’’ Tom laughed. ‘‘It really was fun.’’ 
‘‘But despite all that, we opened up on Oc-
tober the 6th, during Apple Days, and it went 
great,’’ he said. ‘‘We had high sales and the 
team pulled together. It was phenomenal. 
McDonald’s was in awe.’’ 
Following the opening on the Paintsville 
store, their advisor in Ohio helped with the 
banking 
to 
open 
the 
Hutchisons’ 
Prestonsburg and Pikeville locations. 
‘‘Mom said, ‘Boys, we’re not moving, but 
sometimes you gotta do things in life you 
don’t want to do to get where you need to 
go,’ ’’ reminisced Tom. 
‘‘So we signed the papers—Dad, Bob and I, 
and the gentleman leaned backed in his chair 
and said, ‘Thank God. You guys are the 12th 
people we’ve sent down there. Everybody else 
told us to stick it,’ ’’ he joked. 
Tom stated, ‘‘The beauty of it is, this is 
where we came. But the most beautiful part 
of it is, this is where we chose to stay. We 
had chances to leave. We did Paintsville. 
Pikeville was our next one in 1982. Goody 
was two weeks after that. Then we came 
back in 1987 and opened up Prestonsburg as 
store number four.’’ 
When asked for the reasons they chose to 
stay here after launching so many successful 
restaurants, Tom stated, ‘‘I think a couple of 
things. We had people who believed in us— 
our parents, McDonald’s, Mr. Dorton—but we 
believed in the brand. We believed in McDon-
ald’s and we were taught that you have to be 
entrenched in your communities. We learned 
that from our parents. We learned to give 
back. We chose to stay, we chose to be in-
volved and be part of the grain of the com-
munity. To us, that’s what created our suc-
cess. We chose to be local and build upon 
what we had. We knew we had a beautiful 
garden here, so we just kept cultivating our 
garden.’’ 
NOT A ‘DEAD-END’ JOB 
Bob and Tom have given back to their em-
ployees and community members in count-
less ways. Having employed thousands of 
people over the past several decades, Bob 
said, ‘‘I think we’ve had an impact on a lot 
of people. Many people that have come 
through the doorways of the arches have be-
come successful, reaching and fulfilling their 
dreams. Our biggest reward is working with 
people who are a little shy, a little back-
wards and have self-esteem issues and no 
confidence. I love to coach people that are in 
those situations, especially the 14, 15, 16, 17 
and 18-year-olds that have never been ex-
posed to a lot. 
‘‘Also, every manager that we have work-
ing with us now has been promoted within, 
and that in itself is a success,’’ he continued. 
Speaking on the work ethic people of East-
ern Kentucky, Bob stated, ‘‘The people in 
this area want to work given the opportunity 
to work.’’ 
‘‘I love giving people second chances,’’ he 
said. ‘‘We’ve got five or six felons working 
with us right now. We’ve got several single 
mothers who have gone through different 
programs—spousal abuse and things of that 
nature. It all goes back to their confidence 
and self-esteem. That’s been my mission 
field- working with people of that nature. 
He continued, ‘‘A lot of people refer to 
McDonald’s as a dead-end job. It’s no dead 
end job at all. It’s whatever an individual 
wants to make of it. It’s whatever they want 
to do with it. They can create anything they 
want to. They’re their own molder of the 
clay and it’s just a unique thing.’’ 
Tom 
echoed 
the 
sentiment, 
stating, 
‘‘ ‘‘There’s plenty of rewards. Just this week, 
getting hit up on Facebook by a previous 
employee who worked with us for six years, 
who, of course, heard about Bob and I mak-
ing the change, and there are so many indi-
viduals like this young lady who went off to 
other careers, but what they learned as crew 
people they’ve carried into their present 
fields. McDonald’s is not a dead end job. It 
leads to many opportunities. McDonald’s has 
touched so many lives. We’ve been fortunate 
to be and create McDonald’s of East Ken-
tucky and create those opportunities.’’ 
Bob then spoke of various programs that 
McDonald’s offers their employees to better 
their lives. He mentioned the McDonald’s 
Archways to Opportunity program, which re-
cently assisted team member Josh Halliday. 
He stated, ‘‘Through the McDonald’s pro-
gram and through our encouragement, he 
went to college through the McDonald’s pro-
gram. Now he has a four-year degree with 
minimal expense to him thanks to McDon-
ald’s, Tom and I. He’s a rock star and he’s 
our IT guy. He’ll be going to HU in the near 
future and he’ll be dually accredited. He can 
run a restaurant or he can do IT, whatever 
fits his niche, no matter where he’s at in life 
and whether it’s McDonald’s of Kentucky 
and he wants to pack his bags and move 
west. He is a highly sought after, highly val-
uable individual.’’ 
Tom noted, ‘‘The hospitality industry is 
here to stay. Their training is so intense 
with management that an individual can get 
22 hours of training that can be converted to 
accredited college classwork. No restaurant 
and very few businesses have programs re-
motely like that.’’ 
GIVING BACK 
It is this spirit of giving back that has con-
tinued to drive the two brothers over the 
years, both within their restaurants and the 
community at large. 
When asked in what ways he has enjoyed 
giving back the most, Bob stated, ‘‘One was 
being heavily entrenched in Boy Scouts of 
East Kentucky and I got there through the 
assistance of Trigg Dorton. Trying to keep 
Boy Scouts alive in East Kentucky and I was 
on the Bluegrass Council out of Lexington 
and I took that position to try to facilitate 
a stronger stance for Boy Scouts in East 
Kentucky. I left that position two years ago 
but I’m still considered an assistant troop 
master and remain active. I try to keep 
scouting alive in Johnson County. 
‘‘The second thing would be the Christian 
Appalachian Project,’’ Bob said. ‘‘I’ve been 
involved with them for 20 plus years and 
that’s very rewarding in many ways at the 
local level and also when we have national 
disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in New 
Orleans to see how well the people of East 
Kentucky gather around and drive down 
there to help people in dire straits.’’ 
‘‘Third, 
mostly, 
has 
been 
education. 
Whether it’s UPIKE, Mountain Christian 
Academy when they were around in Martin, 
or the Johnson County Board of Education. 
Regardless of which district, this has been 
my number one thing that I’ve thoroughly 
enjoyed. I’ve had some sort of impact with 
education through different programs here in 
East Kentucky.’’ 
His brother Tom bragged on him, stating, 
‘‘ ‘‘Not being biologically a father, he’s been 
a father to more kids than anyone can pos-
sibly imagine.’’ 
Tom then described the philanthropic ef-
forts that meant the most to him. 
‘‘I was on the board of forming Judi’s 
House in Pikeville,’’ Tom said. ‘‘The arts was 
a big thing for me. I work a lot with under-
privileged kids, usually under my grand-
mother’s name. I don’t put my name out

there. That’s not what it’s about. To me, it’s 
about I know where I can put something and 
it gets out there, and you’re helping some-
one. It goes back to giving back. The littlest 
thing can mean so much to somebody. If it’s 
that family, if it’s that crew person at the 
restaurant, it might be that gentleman at 
the gas station you see everyday. On and on 
. . . I think it’s the biggest reward is if it’s 
Christmas and it’s breakfast with Santa and 
there’s children, seeing those kids smile . . . 
I’m touched, man. That’s it right there. And 
watching kids grow up.’’ 
Bob then stated, ‘‘ ‘‘The successes and re-
wards are not always measured in money. 
There are people in East Kentucky that are 
as close as family. They are family—ex-
tended family here in the hills.’’ The two 
brothers then took a moment to reflect on 
what it is like to work as partners in their 
business endeavors. 
‘‘It’s very unique,’’ said Tom, ‘‘to be in a 
partnership for that many years, but then 
it’s unique added to it to be in partnership 
with your brother for all of those years. We 
are totally like night and day. Ask any of 
our crew. But that’s part of it. I respect 
Bob’s forte, he respects mine, but do we al-
ways agree? No. But when we sit down at a 
table and we have a discussion, it may not be 
what I sat down at the table and wanted or 
thought was best, but when we walk away, 
we’re on the same mission. What is the re-
sult we want? We talk it out. It’s about com-
munication, cooperation and coordination.’’ 
‘‘If we really hit head to head, then we do 
paper, scissors, rock,’’ joked Tom. 
Bob stated, ‘‘My strong points might be his 
weak points. His strong points might be my 
weak points. However, through osmosis over 
the years we’ve been able to balance each 
other.’’ 
‘‘I’m a very diplomatic guy,’’ Bob contin-
ued. ‘‘Tom likes to put a lot of bling in stuff. 
Tom likes to make stuff look nice. There’s 
really nothing wrong with it, but we’ve went 
head-to-head on some of the remodels that 
we’ve done. Before, when we were allowed 
the luxury of picking out nice lights and nice 
wallpaper or quality seating, and he wanted 
to do things . . . we went into a boxing 
match over that one. I said, ‘Do whatever 
you’d like, but keep in mind that I’ve got the 
budget.’ ’’ 
LEAVING THE BUSINESS 
The decision to move on from McDonald’s, 
the brothers said, was linked to the death of 
their older brother at 70. 
‘‘Bob and I reflected on the passing of our 
older brother and thought when is the right 
time?’’ Tom said. ‘‘I don’t know if there is a 
right time, but we did make a plan and so we 
made the availability. What was nice is that 
some of the perimeters we had set were like 
‘Who’s going to come in and represent and 
take care of our people? Who would take care 
of our guests? Who is going to best reflect 
what we’ve laid a great foundation out for?’ 
It was about finding the right team, family 
or person who had the same beliefs and was 
going to keep our company intact.’’ 
For Bob and Tom, the Faris family was the 
perfect fit for continuing their legacy. 
Bob stated, ‘‘It was an easy decision. We’ve 
had five or six people approach us over the 
last couple of years without even putting a 
sign out. It was really easy when we saw who 
they (the Faris family) are personally and 
professionally. We knew who to sell it to. 
They’re people-oriented.’’ 
Tom echoed the sentiment, stating, ‘‘The 
Farises, what they had to offer us and what 
they had to offer the team, I want to say 
that we are like book ends. Bob, Tom and 
the Faris family. Same core beliefs. That’s 
what felt good.’’ 
‘‘I wouldn’t be surprised one bit if they 
make this organization better than it al-
ready is,’’ said Bob. 
The two brothers plan to remain in East-
ern Kentucky and continue making a dif-
ference in their communities. 
Tom stated, ‘‘ ‘‘What’s most important is 
that Bob and I came here almost 42 years ago 
to go into business. We had the opportunity 
to leave many times, to relocate. But we 
chose to stay because the mountains spoke 
to us and there’s a lot of opportunity here. 
We’ve seen a lot of opportunity here—but the 
people. The people in the communities and 
the people that were with us in our organiza-
tion—our company was really powered by 
people with pride and we knew we had every-
thing we ever set out for and that we could 
begin and continue our foundation by stay-
ing here in Eastern Kentucky, where we 
chose to make our home. We’re still in the 
community. We’ll still be engrained in many 
things in the community. We are not leaving 
or abandoning, we are just taking ourselves 
to the next level.’’ 
Bob stated, ‘‘We will be here, we will be ac-
tive, we will be involved and the thing that’s 
keeping us here is the people—the people in 
the mountains. People here have been 
great—we’ve been able to help a lot of peo-
ple, but there’s a lot of people that have been 
able to help us.’’ 
Tom said the brothers are simply opening 
another chapter in their lives. 
‘‘We walked in together, and we’re walking 
out together,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s a beautiful sce-
nery.’’ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I would like to take a moment to rec-
ognize and thank the chair of the Sen-
ate Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee and Senator from 
Tennessee, LAMAR ALEXANDER. Senator 
ALEXANDER has committed his life to 
public service for both the people of 
Tennessee and Nation. He served first 
as the Governor of Tennessee, then as 
the 
Secretary 
of 
Education 
under 
President George H. W. Bush from 1991 
to 1993, and finally in the U.S. Senate 
since 2003. Senator ALEXANDER
has 
served more years as Governor and 
U.S. Senator than any other Ten-
nessean who has occupied both posi-
tions. It has been an Honor to serve 
with Senator ALEXANDER over the past 
4 years. 
As chair of the Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee, Sen-
ator ALEXANDER dedicated the end of 
his Senate career to issues such as the 
opioid epidemic, supporting mental 
health providers, lowering prescription 
drug prices, and cultivating innovation 
in the medical field, just to name a 
few. During his tenure as chair Senator 
ALEXANDER presided over more than 70 
hearings and oversaw more than 45 
bills that eventually became law. 
Senator ALEXANDER has dedicated his 
career to faithfully representing the 
people of our great country, believing 
that ‘‘the best decisions are made by 
those closest to the people.’’ Thank 
you, again, to Senator ALEXANDER. I 
wish him a long and peaceful retire-
ment, playing piano and spending time 
with his wife, Honey, their children 
and grandchildren, and dog, Rufus. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I am hon-
ored to pay tribute to my colleague, 
Senator 
LAMAR
ALEXANDER. 
When 
speaking about the Senate, Senator 
ALEXANDER often says, ‘‘It’s hard to 
get here, it’s hard to stay here, and 
while you’re here, you might as well 
try to accomplish something good for 
the country.’’ Over his 18 years in this 
institution, he has embodied those 
words and has served as a guiding force 
of principle and bipartisanship. 
Under his 6 years of leadership as 
chair, the Senate Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee re-
ported 45 bills that became law. It is a 
shining example of his commitment to 
working together and finding resolu-
tion on issues that directly impact 
Americans’ lives. As a member of the 
HELP Committee, I am thankful to 
have had the opportunity to work with 
Senator ALEXANDER on some of these 
bills, such as the Opioid Crisis Re-
sponse Act of 2018 and the reauthoriza-
tion of the Perkins Career and Tech-
nical Education law, among others. I 
am also thankful for Chair ALEXAN-
DER’S, as well as Ranking Member 
PATTY MURRAY’s, support for my work 
to lower the cost of prescription drugs 
and improve access to mental health 
services. 
When I came to the Senate in 2018, 
Senator ALEXANDER welcomed me as a 
colleague and friend, for which I will 
always be grateful. While I will miss 
his esteemed, bipartisan leadership, 
both on the HELP Committee and in 
the Senate, I am grateful for his serv-
ice to our country and wish him and 
Honey the best in their next chapter. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I would 
like to take this time to honor Senator 
LAMAR ALEXANDER. Over the past 30 
years, Senator ALEXANDER has served 
the people of Tennessee as U.S. Sen-
ator, Governor, and U.S. Secretary of 
Education 
under 
President 
George 
H.W. Bush. Over the past 2 years, how-
ever, he has also been a great friend to 
a freshman Senator from Nevada who 
came from a different political party 
but shared his desire to get things done 
for the American people. Like so many 
in this Chamber, I will miss this dedi-
cated public servant who sought to find 
common ground on the many pressing 
issues facing the Senate, including 
healthcare, education, and medical re-
search. 
Senator ALEXANDER has been a great 
mentor and colleague of mine in the 
Senate. I was grateful for how gracious 
he was when I first came to the Senate 
and for his willingness to engage me on 
the key issues facing Congress. As 
chairman of the Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee, of 
which I am proud to be a member, Sen-
ator ALEXANDER worked tirelessly on 
important issues like increasing access 
to telehealth services, lowering health 
care costs, making it easier to apply 
for student financial aid, and advo-
cating for our seniors. I particularly 
appreciated the work he did to support 
the fight against Alzheimer’s disease 
and ensure we invest in robust funding 
for medical research.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7705 
December 18, 2020 
Especially this past year during 
these unprecedented times, the Amer-
ican people needed bipartisan work and 
leadership from its public officials in 
getting relief to struggling commu-
nities across the country. Senator AL-
EXANDER’S
direction and leadership 
through 
debates 
and 
negotiations 
brought out the best in him this year, 
as it has in the past, evident both in 
how he treats people with dignity and 
respect and in his unwavering dedica-
tion to public service. 
Not only will we miss Senator ALEX-
ANDER’S presence in this Chamber, but 
we will also miss his beautiful piano 
skills during the holiday season. I hope 
he will have the opportunity to come 
back to the Senate Hart Building and 
play for us again soon. I promise I will 
be there in the front row. 
Senator ALEXANDER, I wish you the 
best in the next chapter of your life 
and hope you have a wonderful retire-
ment after your long and impactful ca-
reer. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO PAT ROBERTS 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to someone 
who is more than just a colleague. He 
is more than just a friend. In fact, he 
has been a true partner here in the 
Senate, and that has paid huge divi-
dends for farmers, families, and com-
munities across our country. 
PAT ROBERTS has been here in the 
Senate for a long time. Some might 
even call him an institution. At a re-
cent Ag Committee event, I joked that, 
as a young man, he advised George 
Washington 
on 
farm 
policy. 
That 
might be a bit of an exaggeration, but 
his legacy can hardly be overstated. He 
has left a lasting imprint on farm and 
food policy in this country. He is the 
only person to have written a farm bill 
as both the chair of the House and Sen-
ate Agriculture Committees. 
Those of us who have had the honor 
of serving alongside PAT on the Senate 
Agriculture Committee know there is 
no other place quite like it. It is a 
place where we leave politics at the 
door and focus on the ways we can im-
prove people’s lives and livelihoods in 
rural America. We do that because we 
know agriculture isn’t a red issue or a 
blue issue. Agriculture and food policy 
affect everyone. And nobody knows 
that better than PAT. 
Senator ROBERTS and I never gave up 
on passing the 2018 farm bill even when 
it got tough. At the beginning of nego-
tiations, we made a commitment to 
work together. We visited each other’s 
home States—twice, in fact. I arrived 
in ‘‘The Little Apple’’ of Manhattan, 
KS, wearing K-State purple. A few 
weeks 
later, 
PAT
came 
to 
Frankenmuth, MI and wore a MSU 
green tie. 
Around this time, we also made a 
commitment to each other to write a 
bipartisan farm bill. Throughout the 
entire process, I never doubted that 
PAT had my back—even when negotia-
tions got tough. Thanks to this part-
nership, we achieved the most bipar-
tisan bill in history. 
We first passed our Senate bill by 86 
votes, but that wasn’t enough. We de-
cided to beat that record and passed 
the final farm bill by 87 votes, the most 
yes votes ever. We were able to do that 
because we have a unique partnership 
built on trust and mutual respect. And 
the outcome was a strong, bipartisan 
bill that provided certainty for all 
farmers, from wheat farmers in Kansas 
to cherry growers in Michigan. Part of 
that certainty is Federal crop insur-
ance—and nobody deserves more credit 
for the foundation of that important 
safety net program than Senator ROB-
ERTS. 
PAT is also a champion for food secu-
rity, agricultural exports, and agricul-
tural research, which is why he and I 
worked together to establish the Foun-
dation for Food and Agriculture in the 
2014 Farm Bill. He also understands the 
importance of protecting food assist-
ance for children and families. I was 
honored to share the Food Research 
and 
Action 
Center’s 
Distinguished 
Service Award with Senator ROBERTS 
last year for our teamwork. 
Above all, it has been an honor work-
ing with PAT because he is truly one of 
a kind. From the moment I met him, it 
became 
abundantly 
clear 
that 
he 
wasn’t your run-of-the-mill politician. 
Some say it is his unflappable nature. 
Others say it is his unique sense of 
humor. But to me, PAT ROBERTS is de-
fined by his loyalty, integrity, and 
dedication to the people of Kansas. 
He started his career as a first lieu-
tenant in the Marine Corps. And it is 
clear he has carried that courage and 
conviction with him throughout his 
life. He was also a newspaper reporter, 
which makes sense when you consider 
his dogged determination, and, for bet-
ter or worse, his ability to be excep-
tionally quotable. 
As a public servant, he is so beloved 
in his home State of Kansas that he 
never lost an election, a record of 24–0. 
If only his K-State Wildcats could be so 
lucky. 
Senator PAT ROBERTS, it has been 
such an honor to be your partner—and 
an even bigger honor to be your friend. 
So while your retirement is well 
earned, you will be deeply missed on 
the Agriculture Committee and here in 
the Senate. 
Thank you for all you have done for 
farmers, families, and the American 
people. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I would like to recognize and thank the 
Senator from Kansas, PAT ROBERTS. He 
has served the people of Kansas and our 
Nation in Congress for nearly 40 years, 
serving 16 years in the House of Rep-
resentatives and in U.S. Senate since 
1997. Over the past 4 years, I have had 
the pleasure of serving with Senator 
ROBERTS in the Senate, including on 
the Committee on Rules and Adminis-
tration and the Finance Committee for 
the last 2 years. 
Senator ROBERTS has been a prag-
matic partner on legislation focused on 
supporting rural hospitals and tele-
health access during the pandemic. We 
introduced the Rural ACO Improve-
ment Act to support rural health care 
providers as well as the Ensuring Par-
ity in Medicare Advantage for Audio- 
Only Telehealth Act to protect seniors’ 
access to telehealth visits even when 
video is not available during the 
COVID–19 public health emergency. I 
respect and appreciate Senator ROB-
ERTS’S dedication to these important 
issues. 
Senator ROBERTS has had a long and 
esteemed tenure in Congress, and his 
emphasis on working across the aisle 
can be seen clearly with the record 
number of votes in favor for the 2018 
farm bill. His evident love for his fam-
ily, rich heritage as a fourth-genera-
tion Kansan, and his call for levity and 
humor in the Senate to ensure biparti-
sanship will be remembered for years 
to come. I thank Senator ROBERTS and 
wish him, his wife Franki, and his fam-
ily all the best in the coming years. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL B. ENZI 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I want to take a moment to recognize 
and thank the Senator from Wyoming, 
MIKE ENZI. He has served the State of 
Wyoming and our Nation for more than 
40 years, first as the Mayor of Gillette, 
then in both chambers of the Wyoming 
Legislature, and finally in the U.S. 
Senate since 1997. Over the past 4 
years, I have had the pleasure of serv-
ing with Senator ENZI in the Senate, 
including on the Finance Committee 
for the last 2 years. Together, we intro-
duced the 1921 Silver Dollar Coin Anni-
versary Act, to celebrate the anniver-
sary of the Peace silver dollar memori-
alizing the end of World War I. 
Senator ENZI has had a long and dis-
tinguished tenure in the Senate as both 
the chair and ranking member of the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee and as the chair of 
the Budget Committee. Across all his 
legislative efforts, Senator ENZI has re-
mained a staunch advocate of his ‘‘80 
percent tool’’—the belief that we can 
get a lot done when we can agree on 80 
percent of the issues 80 percent of the 
time. This lesson is one that we all 
should take to heart as we enter the 
117th Congress and the future. 
Senator ENZI’s legacy and his words 
of wisdom—do what is right, do your 
best, treat others as they wish to be 
treated—will continue to remind us to 
work hard and serve our constituents 
to the best of our abilities. I wish him 
a peaceful retirement fly-fishing on the 
banks of Wyoming’s rivers, and I wish 
his wife Diana and his family all the 
best in the next chapter.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7706 
December 18, 2020 
in the U.S. Congress. Having served in 
the House of Representatives from 1999 
to 2004 and later in the Senate from 
2005 until his retirement in 2019, Sen-
ator Isakson has dedicated himself to 
supporting 
longstanding, 
bipartisan 
measures. His ability to find common 
ground and his commitment to public 
service are a reflection of his adher-
ence to Georgians’ and our Nation’s 
values. It is my honor to have served 
alongside Senator Isakson during the 
116th Congress. 
In his tenure, Senator Isakson spon-
sored over 130 bills—a testament to his 
determination and aptitude to work 
across party lines. Having served in the 
Georgia Air National Guard, Senator 
Isakson played a key role in passing sa-
lient legislation to aid our veterans. As 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs, he led the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs Educational 
Assistance Improvement Act of 2017, 
which created opportunities for vet-
erans to pursue higher education. I am 
proud to have cosponsored this bill in 
my first year in office and to have 
worked with Senator Isakson to unite 
Congress in support of our veterans, 
among many other bipartisan causes 
led by Johnny. 
Senator Isakson’s time in office has 
left a profound mark in the Halls of 
Congress. I am confident his courage, 
compassion, 
and 
celebrated 
accom-
plishments will be remembered for 
years to come. I thank Senator Isakson 
for his service and send my best wishes 
to him and his wife Dianne and their 
children, Kevin, Julie, and John. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TOM UDALL 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor someone whom I 
have had the good fortune to serve 
alongside both in the House and the 
Senate. 
In American political history, there 
are certain names that carry a legacy. 
There are the Roosevelts, a family of 
great means who nonetheless under-
stood the deeply personal pain of the 
Great Depression and helped bring a 
nation through it. There are the Ken-
nedys, a family that for generations 
has been near the center of American 
power and popular culture. 
And there are the Udalls. 
Now, the Udalls have never been 
flashy. They might not be the equiva-
lent of political royalty. You are more 
likely to find Udalls in cowboy boots 
and jeans than expensive suits. But 
they are a family that is deeply de-
voted to public service, protecting the 
people and places of the West, and just 
being some of the kindest, hardest- 
working, most decent folks you could 
ever meet. 
Senator TOM
UDALL
has certainly 
lived up to his family’s legacy during 
his long career in public service. New 
Mexico is so fortunate to be rep-
resented by him, and I feel so fortunate 
to have him as a friend. 
TOM, it has been such a pleasure to 
work with you on issues including pro-
tecting funding for the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative, ensuring that 
our community health centers receive 
full funding, strengthening rural com-
munities, and improving services for 
our veterans and our work together on 
TSCA reform. I have been so impressed 
by your work on clean energy and on 
protecting the wild places that make 
our States so special—and, of course, 
your important work on reforming the 
Senate. And I am so grateful for your 
strong leadership on the Indian Affairs 
Committee and your hard work on be-
half of our Nation’s Tribes. You have 
also set yourself apart through your 
work on foreign relations and on keep-
ing our Nation safe. 
I will never forget our trip to Viet-
nam and South Korea last year. It was 
such a special moment when Jill orga-
nized a Passover Seder for everyone on 
our plane to Ho Chi Minh City. It 
brought everyone together to focus on 
our common humanity and what we 
are each called to do: serve others. 
Whatever the future holds for you, I 
have no doubt that you will continue 
serving the people of New Mexico and 
this great Nation. Public service, that 
is what Udalls do. 
TOM, congratulations on your retire-
ment, and thank you for a job well 
done. You have been a true blessing to 
New Mexico and our Nation. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to honor my colleague and good 
friend, Senator TOM UDALL, who will be 
retiring from the Senate at the end of 
this Congress. TOM has been a forceful 
advocate for the people of New Mexico, 
a champion for all Americans, and a 
guardian of our Nation’s public lands 
and our democracy. It has been my 
privilege to partner with him, both in 
the House and Senate, over the past 17 
years. 
TOM’s family roots were grown from 
American history. Generations ago, his 
ancestors traveled west and settled on 
the American frontier. Although cen-
turies have passed since those early 
pioneers, TOM’s deep connection to our 
country’s rich history hasn’t waned. He 
holds deep respect for the communities 
that treasured the American landscape 
long before his family arrived, and TOM 
has championed the cause of Tribal 
sovereignty throughout his career. As 
vice chair of the Senate Indian Affairs 
Committee, he fought to ensure that 
our country fulfills its obligations to 
indigenous Tribes. His commitment to 
this cause reminds us, as lawmakers, 
that the government has a responsi-
bility to respect the rights of all com-
munities from coast to coast. 
His personal link to the American ex-
periment has also nourished a passion 
for conserving our natural inheritance. 
In the House, I was proud to work with 
him on bolstering our Nation’s renew-
able energy infrastructure. In the Sen-
ate, I have been privileged to serve 
with him on the Appropriations Sub-
committee on the Interior and Envi-
ronment. He has been an advocate for 
supporting the Chesapeake Bay in my 
home State of Maryland and helped us 
secure a historic increase in funding to 
the Chesapeake Bay Program. Senator 
UDALL’s pioneering work in these are-
nas has rallied colleagues around the 
cause of protecting our environment, 
culminating this August with the pas-
sage of the Great American Outdoors 
Act. His tireless efforts to preserve 
America’s natural heritage will live on 
through the clean water and clean air 
that he helped safeguard for genera-
tions to come. But TOM knew well that 
preserving our environment must go 
hand-in-hand with defending our planet 
against climate change. His landmark 
bill on renewable energy standards of-
fers a model for the type of rigorous 
approach we can take to cut carbon 
emissions 
and 
address 
this 
global 
threat. 
Senator 
UDALL’s 
commitment 
to 
keeping our planet healthy has been 
equal in force to his mission of keeping 
our democracy healthy. Throughout 
his career, TOM promoted the notion 
that we need structural change in our 
institutions if we want to move our 
country forward. He and I worked to-
gether on campaign finance reform to 
help insulate our elections from the in-
fluence of special interests and big cor-
porations and have fought to reform fi-
nancing for Presidential elections and 
the FEC. In Washington, he has been a 
vocal critic of government inaction 
and proposed rule fixes to remedy con-
gressional paralysis, both while in the 
minority and in the majority. His calls 
for change have challenged this body to 
act on institutional adjustments that 
could help us get more done for the 
American people. 
But beyond these achievements, one 
of TOM’s greatest contributions to the 
Senate is the way in which he has 
made this Chamber a kinder place. His 
warm temperament and humble nature 
exemplify the character of a true pub-
lic servant—someone who is here to do 
good work on behalf of their constitu-
ents, not stroke their own ego. He has 
stayed grounded and honored those 
whom he serves, always looking to 
move our country forward. In his fare-
well address, Senator UDALL reminded 
us 
that 
disagreements 
in 
politics 
shouldn’t get in the way of progress. 
TOM lives and breathes this bedrock 
principle and has always extended a 
hand to those across the aisle in order 
to deliver for the American people. Al-
though he is now headed back West to 
return to the place that made him, he 
is leaving a lasting legacy of collabora-
tion and success that cannot be un-
done. 
Thank you, TOM, for your dedication 
to this body and to our country, and I 
wish you and your family the best in 
the years ahead. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I want to take a moment to recognize 
and thank the vice chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, 
Senator UDALL, for his years of leader-
ship in the Senate, on our committee, 
and for his commitment and service to

our Tribal communities. It has been an 
honor to serve with him the past 4 
years. 
I want to thank Senator UDALL for 
his wisdom, his mentorship, and the ex-
ample that he has set for us through 
his many years in Congress and in the 
Senate. I also want to thank his staff 
for their support of all of our work in 
the Senate Committee on Indian Af-
fairs. Senator UDALL’s tireless leader-
ship and ability to work across the 
aisle with Chairman HOEVEN, each 
Member of the Senate, and our Tribal 
leaders has encouraged all of us to 
truly work together in a bipartisan 
manner to find solutions on behalf of 
our Tribal communities. 
I am particularly thankful, for Sen-
ator UDALL’s leadership in helping en-
sure that Senator MURKOWSKI’s and my 
bills, the Not Invisible Act and Savan-
na’s Act, became law. With their pas-
sage, we are finally beginning to ad-
dress the serious epidemic of missing 
and murdered indigenous women and 
girls. His commitment to combatting 
violence against Native women and 
children has been crucial for their suc-
cess. 
Senator UDALL’s achievements in the 
Senate stand as a testament to the 
spirit of the West, which we both call 
home. From conserving and protecting 
our public lands through the Great 
American Outdoors Act and cham-
pioning the rights of Indian Country, 
to empowering our Tribal communities 
through introducing the Native Amer-
ican Voting Rights Act and ensuring 
vital coronavirus relief funds and care 
reach those who need it most, Senator 
UDALL has always prioritized the needs 
of western communities. 
Whether it is through finding cre-
ative solutions to address the home-
work gap through partnering with me 
to introduce E-Rate Support for School 
Bus Wi-Fi, or fighting for quality hous-
ing through reauthorization of the Na-
tive American Housing Assistance and 
Self-Determination Act, his work here 
has led to tangible benefits for rural 
and Native communities in my home 
State of Nevada and all across the 
country. 
I have no doubt that Senator UDALL’s 
legacy of service here will continue to 
leave a powerful impact on the lives of 
many in our Tribal communities for 
years to come, so thank you again, 
Senator UDALL, for all your contribu-
tions. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today with great pride to honor my 
dear friend and colleague, Senator TOM 
UDALL. Throughout his time in Con-
gress, he has continued to be a staunch 
advocate for protecting working fami-
lies, our public lands, and so much 
more. TOM’s desire and commitment to 
serve the people of New Mexico over 
the past 20 years are not only inspiring 
but serve as an example of what a 
faithful public servant represents. 
As we all know, the ‘‘Udall’’ name 
rings with great respect and honor 
among those involved in public service, 
and TOM is no exception. As a true na-
tive of New Mexico, Senator UDALL un-
derstands the importance of protecting 
our public lands and the people who re-
side there. It has been an honor to 
serve alongside him in the western del-
egation to secure funding for environ-
mental restoration and public lands 
preservation. It has been my distinct 
pleasure to work with him and his staff 
on monumental legislation such as the 
Great American Outdoors Act, which 
permanently funds the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, LWCF. The LWCF 
provides funds for restoration and out-
door recreation opportunities in Ne-
vada and numerous projects in New 
Mexico. We have also fought side-by- 
side to defend our public lands from 
those who would take them out of pub-
lic hands. 
Senator UDALL, your mentorship, ex-
pertise, and, most of all, your friend-
ship will be deeply missed. You and 
your family welcomed me with such 
warmth when I began my journey as a 
Senator. I am so grateful to have not 
only a great professional relationship 
but a wonderful personal one as well. I 
would also like to take a moment to 
thank your wife Jill for showing my 
husband Larry the procedures and pro-
tocols as of being new Senate spouse. 
Larry and I are so happy to have you 
and Jilly as friends for life. 
Mr. President, Senator UDALL’s dec-
ades as a public servant are an inspira-
tion for so many of our colleagues, my-
self included. The western delegation 
will continue to honor Senator UDALL’s 
work to reduce global emissions, build 
a clean energy economy, and protect 
the public lands that we all hold so 
dear. It has been an honor to work with 
Senator UDALL, and I wish him and Jill 
a joyful and tranquil transition in the 
years to come.

TRIBUTE TO CORY GARDNER 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I want to recognize and thank Senator 
CORY GARDNER for his years of service 
to the people of Colorado. Senator 
GARDNER has served the people of Colo-
rado for 15 years as a member of the 
State house of representatives, a Con-
gressman from Colorado Fourth Dis-
trict, and as a U.S. Senator. It has been 
an honor to serve with him in the U.S. 
Senate and alongside him on the Sen-
ate Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources. 
Like my home State of Nevada, Colo-
rado is a precious treasure of the 
American West, famed for its soaring 
peaks and beautiful countryside. Sen-
ator GARDNER committed himself to 
protect and preserve heritage through 
championing our national parks and 
public lands with the passage of the 
Great Americans Outdoors Act. Sen-
ator GARDNER also understands that 
preserving our outdoor spaces is vital 
to our western economies and to the 
physical and emotional well-being of 
the people who call our State home. I 
must thank him for supporting our 
successful, bipartisan effort to reau-
thorize Brand USA to promote the 
United States as a destination to glob-
al travelers and support workers and 
businesses in tourism and hospitality 
in our States. I also want to thank him 
for partnering with me on the ACCESS 
Broadband Act to enhance access to 
Federal broadband programs and de-
liver these vital services to our rural 
communities. Finally, I must acknowl-
edge Senator GARDNER for joining Sen-
ators 
BURR, 
SINEMA, 
Congressman 
DESAULNIER, and me in introducing the 
Moving FIRST Act to invest in our 
local communities infrastructure to 
help them overcome local challenges 
and meet the needs of the future. 
Thank you, again, to Senator GARD-
NER, for his public service. It has been 
an honor to work with him here in the 
Senate and join in his commitment to 
all of us throughout the region we call 
home.

TRIBUTE TO DOUG JONES 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to someone 
who hasn’t been in the Senate very 
long, but whose character, compassion, 
and dedication to justice will leave a 
mark here for years to come. 
Many of us are old enough to remem-
ber that awful day in 1963 when a 
peaceful Sunday morning was shat-
tered by a bomb. This attack on the 
16th Street Baptist Church in Bir-
mingham, carried out by members of 
the Ku Klux Klan, ended the lives of 
four young girls: Carole Robertson, 
Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, 
and Denise McNair. 
I was just a little younger than Car-
ole, Addie, and Cynthia, who were all 
14. DOUG JONES was just a couple of 
years younger than 11-year-old Denise. 
When something so unspeakable hap-
pens to people you could have gone to 
school with, been friends with, and 
grown up with, it sticks with you. 
It certainly stuck with DOUG. He got 
involved in organizing at the Univer-
sity of Alabama and volunteered on a 
campaign to modernize the State’s 
courts. After graduating from Cum-
berland School of Law at Samford Uni-
versity in Birmingham, he served as 
staff counsel on the Judiciary Com-
mittee 
for 
Senator 
Howell 
Heflin, 
whose seat he currently holds. 
After time as an Assistant U.S. At-
torney and in private practice, DOUG 
was confirmed by the Senate as U.S. 
Attorney for the Northern District of 
Alabama in 1997. In that position, he 
successfully prosecuted two of the four 
men responsible for the devastation on 
that long-ago Sunday morning. He 
didn’t just remember those four little 
girls. Instead, he fought to bring their 
families some measure of justice and 
closure—because that is just the type 
of person Doug is. 
Doug, your Future Act to perma-
nently fund historically Black colleges 
and universities will help build a 
brighter future for students across our

country. It has been such an honor to 
work with you to extend funding for 
community health centers and to ex-
pand access to care and resources to 
families living with Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. And millions of Americans have 
you to thank for a timely vote to save 
the Affordable Care Act and their 
healthcare. 
Doug, you know what really matters: 
pursuing 
justice, 
expanding 
oppor-
tunity, and simply making life better 
for the people who sent us here. 
Three days after those beautiful 
young girls were killed, Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., delivered their eulogy. 
In it, he said this: ‘‘(Their deaths) say 
to each of us, black and white alike, 
that we must substitute courage for 
caution. 
‘‘They say to us that we must be con-
cerned not merely about who murdered 
them, but about the system, the way of 
life, the philosophy which produced the 
murderers. 
‘‘Their death says to us that we must 
work passionately and unrelentingly 
for the realization of the American 
dream.’’ 
Doug, you might not know yet what 
your future holds, but you have been 
working 
passionately 
and 
unrelentingly for the realization of the 
American dream for your entire career. 
I have absolutely no doubt that in 
whatever you do next, Doug, you will 
continue to be a tireless advocate for 
justice and equality. 
Thank you for who you are. It has 
been such an honor serving with you. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
today I rise to honor my dear friend 
and colleague, Senator DOUG JONES of 
Alabama. 
DOUG
JONES
is fearless. He cuts 
against the grain, shrugging off critics 
to chart his own path rooted in deeply 
held principles of justice, virtue, and 
equality. After law enforcement had 
failed to prosecute civil rights cases for 
decades, 
DOUG
JONES
successfully 
brought a measure of justice to the 
families of the four girls killed in the 
16th Street Baptist Church bombing. 
When skeptics claimed there was no 
chance of him winning a Senate race in 
Alabama, 
DOUG
JONES
stayed 
the 
course and clinched an upset victory. 
And despite having seen some of his 
own colleagues shy away from address-
ing controversial issues in this Cham-
ber, DOUG JONES stood up for what he 
knew was right, from his very first 
speech in the Senate when he delivered 
a moving address on the threat of gun 
violence. 
But despite his tenacity, Senator 
JONES has never stopped leading with 
compassion—compassion for his col-
leagues, compassion for the people of 
Alabama, and compassion for all Amer-
icans. Like his personal role model, 
Atticus Finch, Senator JONES abides by 
the principle that in order to know 
someone else truly and fully, you need 
to ‘‘climb in his skin and walk around 
in it.’’ And it is that empathy that has 
led Senator JONES to champion unity 
over division. My seat is near DOUG’s 
here on the Senate floor, and we sat to-
gether during the impeachment trial. 
Even during one of the darkest mo-
ments in our country’s history, DOUG 
maintained faith in our better angels. 
When the trial of the President came 
to a close, Senator JONES issued a call 
for unity, saying, ‘‘We must find a way 
to come together, to set aside partisan 
differences, and to focus on what we 
have in common as Americans.’’ He 
looked forward, past the tension con-
suming Washington and toward bright-
er days ahead. That is DOUG. That is 
how he works. 
From the time I chaired the DSCC 
during then-Candidate JONES’ run for 
Senate in Alabama, to our years to-
gether in this Chamber, I have always 
admired his desire to put country first, 
follow his conscience, and value prin-
ciple over politics. He is a man of enor-
mous integrity—someone who never 
forgot who sent him to the Senate, 
someone who always worked to get re-
sults, and someone who achieved more 
in just a few years than many Senators 
do in multiple terms. 
I was proud to work with Senator 
JONES on the passage of the FUTURE 
Act, which provided permanent funding 
for historically Black colleges and uni-
versities. His commitment to that 
cause has directly benefitted the four 
proud HBCUs in my State of Maryland, 
and the bill is a step forward in the 
fight for equity in higher education. I 
am also grateful for Senator JONES’s 
work to end the military widow’s tax, 
which prevented military spouses from 
receiving the full benefits they de-
served. Senator JONES was a champion 
for the widows who had lived for too 
long with broken promises. He was 
principled, persistent, and got the job 
done. 
DOUG JONES is a model public serv-
ant, someone the American people can 
look up to and admire. His absence will 
be deeply felt in the U.S. Senate, but I 
know that just because he will depart 
the Nation’s Capital on January 3 
doesn’t mean his role in this fight is 
over. Service is in his bones, plain and 
simple. It has been a profound honor 
and privilege to serve alongside him. 
Thank you, DOUG—thank you for all 
you have done for our country, and I 
want to extend my warmest thoughts 
and wishes to you, your wife Louise, 
your three children, and your grand-
children on behalf of a deeply grateful 
nation. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I want to take a moment to recognize 
and thank Senator DOUG JONES for his 
service in the U.S. Senate and to the 
people of Alabama. In just 2 years, Sen-
ator JONES
has become a respected 
voice in the Senate and built a reputa-
tion as someone who puts the interests 
of his constituents before partisanship 
or ideology. It has been a privilege 
working alongside him during the 116th 
Congress. 
Senator JONES’s achievements are re-
markable for a first-term Senator. I 
was proud to work with him on his 
Military Widow’s Tax Elimination Act, 
which helps ensure that nearly 70,000 
surviving 
military 
spouses 
receive 
their full benefits, as he shepherded 
this 
important 
legislation 
through 
Congress. He has also passed legisla-
tion to expand insurance coverage for 
COVID–19 vaccines and treatments, 
helped his rural constituents navigate 
the healthcare system, and promoted 
justice for victims in unsolved criminal 
civil rights cases. I am proud to have 
worked with him on my legislation to 
expand workforce development pro-
grams and hands-on learning in high 
schools. 
These 
incredible 
accomplishments 
demonstrate the hard work and dedica-
tion that Senator JONES brought to the 
Senate. He is a man with unwavering 
principles but a strong drive to find 
common ground and bring tangible 
benefits to the people of Alabama. 
Senator JONES’s legacy in the Senate 
is one I hope we can all remember as 
we look to work together for the bet-
terment of our States and the Nation. 
It has been a privilege to work along-
side him for the last 2 years, and I 
know he will continue to inspire us all 
as he begins the next chapter in his dis-
tinguished life. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, DOUG 
JONES and I came to the Senate at the 
same time—a class of just the two of us 
arriving in an off-year to fill partial 
terms. We were sworn in together on 
January 3, 2018, with each of us accom-
panied by a former Vice President— 
Walter Mondale in my case, Joe Biden 
in DOUG’s. We shared the unique experi-
ence of arriving during an unprece-
dented period in the Senate’s history, 
and I am fortunate to have spent the 
first 3 years of my Senate journey with 
a partner like DOUG by my side. 
DOUG and I both joined the Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee, and we quickly found common 
cause 
in 
rural 
healthcare. 
Within 
months, 
DOUG
had 
introduced 
the 
Rural Health Liaison Act, which helped 
to unify Federal resources to better 
support the health of rural commu-
nities. This act, which became law 
through our collaboration on the 2018 
farm bill, put the government in a bet-
ter position to respond to crises like 
the one we are experiencing today. The 
foresight and compassion DOUG
dis-
played in leading this initiative were 
hallmarks of his time in the Senate. 
Whether he was working to lower the 
costs of higher education, helping me 
bring high-speed internet to rural 
areas, or passing legislation to support 
military spouses, I could always count 
on DOUG to be a voice for rural commu-
nities on the HELP Committee. 
DOUG and I also sat next to each 
other on the Banking Committee, 
where I have appreciated his thought-
ful focus on rectifying racial dispari-
ties in income and wealth, particularly 
those caused by Federal policies of the 
past. In addition, DOUG played a key 
role in leading a bipartisan effort to

update Federal anti-money laundering 
laws, which I am hopeful will become 
law as part of the NDAA later this 
month. Thanks to his work, we are on 
the verge of finally putting a stop to 
the use of anonymous shell companies 
by traffickers, terrorists, and tax dodg-
ers, and making numerous other re-
forms that will cut off funding for 
criminal actors and make Americans 
safer. 
I have been proud to call DOUG a col-
league and friend. I know that Ameri-
cans in Alabama, Minnesota, and ev-
erywhere in between join me in thank-
ing him for his service and wishing him 
a fond farewell. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor and thank my dear 
friend and colleague, Senator DOUG 
JONES, for the hard and noble work he 
has done in the United States Senate. I 
greatly admire his passion and all that 
he accomplished for the people of Ala-
bama and all Americans. 
For his entire life, Senator JONES has 
stood tall as a pillar of justice and 
equality. After graduating law school, 
Senator JONES became counsel to the 
Senate Judiciary Committee for then- 
Senator Howell Heflin and served as an 
Assistant 
United 
States 
Attorney 
shortly after. Senator JONES then be-
came the U.S. Attorney for the North-
ern District of Alabama, where he 
fought for civil liberties and against 
racial injustice. As U.S. Attorney, he 
successfully was able to prosecute two 
of the four men who were responsible 
for the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street 
Baptist Church, and later indicted do-
mestic terrorist Eric Rudolph. By pur-
suing these cases, Senator JONES en-
couraged us all to continue to reject 
bigotry and hate in all its forms. 
In 2017, Senator JONES became the 
first Democrat to represent the state of 
Alabama since 1997. He made it his 
duty to represent the people of Ala-
bama in every vote he made on the 
Senate floor. He always voted in the 
best interests of his constituents, even 
when it wasn’t politically expedient or 
convenient. His service stands as a re-
minder that bipartisanship is vital in 
addressing the issues that our nation 
currently faces. 
Senator JONES is a man of bravery 
and strength. His heart and passion are 
not only moving, but admirable as 
well. I am very proud to have had Sen-
ator JONES as a friend and colleague as 
we served alongside each other on the 
HELP Committee these past two years, 
and I am eager to continue watching 
his fierce fight against injustice, join-
ing with him in this struggle until hate 
is rejected in every corner of this na-
tion. 
DOUG, you have been a great friend 
and colleague of mine in the Senate. It 
has been an honor serving alongside 
you, and I am so sorry to see you go. 
We have shared so much, both on and 
off the Senate floor, and I look forward 
to continuing our friendship. During 
your time here, you’ve shown bravery 
and strength, you followed your con-
scious, and you have always done what 
was right. The lives of the people of 
Alabama have been made better with 
you as their Senator. You will be dear-
ly missed. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MARTHA MCSALLY 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I would like to take a moment to rec-
ognize and thank Senator MARTHA 
MCSALLY for her career of service. I 
had the pleasure of serving alongside 
Senator MCSALLY on various commit-
tees but primarily wanted to under-
score our work together on the Senate 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources’ Subcommittee on Water and 
Power. 
In 
her 
capacity 
as 
sub-
committee chair and mine as ranking 
Member, we were successful in shep-
herding the Colorado River Drought 
Contingency Plan Authorization Act, 
P.L. 116–1, through the Senate and en-
suring that it was signed into law on 
April 16, 2019. This monumental legisla-
tion culminated years of work by the 
seven Colorado River basin States, re-
searchers, local stakeholders, and Trib-
al governments, and affirmed the com-
mitments made by the basin States to 
reduce States’ water usage and target 
minimum water levels for reservoirs in 
the river’s watershed, such as Lake 
Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border 
and Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona 
border. I commend Senator MCSALLY’s 
dedication to this effort to secure sus-
tainable water levels for the 40 million 
Americans who rely on the Colorado 
River as a water source. It has truly 
been a pleasure to work with Senator 
MCSALLY on this and other western pri-
orities, and I wish her and her family 
all the best in their future endeavors. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING REPUB-
LICAN SENATE COLLEAGUES 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to pay tribute to my friends and 
colleagues on the Republican side of 
the aisle who are departing the Senate 
at the conclusion of this Congress. Al-
though we might not have always seen 
eye-to-eye on every issue, I am proud 
to have worked with them on finding 
solutions to the many challenges fac-
ing the American people. 
On January 3, when the new Congress 
is sworn in, we will be missing among 
our ranks a stalwart advocate for the 
people of Wyoming who has valiantly 
served in the U.S. Senate for 23 years, 
MIKE ENZI. Senator ENZI’s service to 
this body has been defined both by a 
commitment to principle and a willing-
ness to find common ground. MIKE be-
lieved fully that our focus in Wash-
ington must always be on crafting leg-
islation, not making headlines. He 
took a low-ego approach to lawmaking 
and prized delivering results over fo-
menting conflict. On many occasions, 
he extended a hand to those working 
on the other side of the aisle, including 
the late great Paul Sarbanes of Mary-
land, with whom he collaborated in 
crafting the bipartisan Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act. I was privileged to serve with Sen-
ator ENZI on the Senate Budget Com-
mittee, and despite our differences, he 
always made an effort to treat me and 
others on the committee with kind-
ness, as a true professional and a gen-
tleman. 
His 
infamous 
‘‘80 
percent 
tool’’—the notion that all of us can 
agree on 80 percent of the issues 80 per-
cent of the time—will continue to re-
mind us on Capitol Hill of the capacity 
for Congress to come together on the 
issues that matter. I wish him the best 
in the years to come. 
I am also sad to say goodbye to my 
neighbor in the Senate Hart Building 
and a veteran of this Chamber, Senator 
PAT ROBERTS, who is retiring after four 
decades serving his home State of Kan-
sas in the U.S. Congress. Although Sen-
ator ROBERTS has had a storied career 
in Washington, all of us know that his 
first love was the U.S. Marine Corps. 
PAT ROBERTS took what he learned in 
the Armed Forces of humility, friend-
ship, and cooperation and brought 
those values with him to Washington. 
As a lawmaker, Senator ROBERTS has 
led with good humor and grace. I was 
honored to serve with him on the Sen-
ate Agriculture Committee, where we 
worked together on the 2018 farm bill 
to enhance provisions to help farmers 
clean up the Chesapeake Bay, correct 
an inequity in how our 1890 HBCUs 
spend Federal funds, and support our 
Nation’s minority and veteran farmers. 
I was also pleased that he joined me in 
introducing a bill that would fully fund 
the IDEA in order to support our 
schools and ensure a first-rate edu-
cation for children with disabilities. 
His tireless commitment to promoting 
comity and camaraderie in this body 
demonstrated that kindness often pre-
cedes compromise. I salute the years of 
service he has given in the defense of 
our Nation and the promotion of the 
common good. And I say directly to my 
colleague and friend, PAT
ROBERTS: 
semper fi and Godspeed. 
But of those departing the Congress 
this year, few rival the erudition, 
warmth, and spirit of Senator LAMAR 
ALEXANDER. He is a true renaissance 
man, who excelled in the academy as 
president of the University of Ten-
nessee, served our country first as Gov-
ernor, then as Senator, and has enter-
tained scores of captivated listeners 
with his skills at a piano. Those of us 
in the U.S. Senate who have had the 
distinct 
pleasure 
of 
working 
with 
LAMAR ALEXANDER recognize his talent 
for building consensus and reaching 
across the aisle to hammer out real so-
lutions to the problems facing the 
American people. I am particularly 
grateful for his work on the Senate 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources, leading the charge to publish a 
report on our Nation’s competitiveness 
in science and technology. That report, 
‘‘Rising Above the Gathering Storm,’’ 
produced findings that have been vital 
to the promotion of increased funding 
for science and STEM education in my

State of Maryland and across the coun-
try. And his leadership in shepherding 
through the Great American Outdoors 
Act has allowed for serious invest-
ments in our Nation’s public lands, our 
conservation efforts, and our outdoor 
economy. Senator ALEXANDER’s com-
mitment to bridge-building presents a 
model for how the U.S. Congress can 
come together, despite the nature of 
these divisive times. He will be dearly 
missed. 
Lastly, I would like to extend a warm 
farewell to my colleague Senator CORY 
GARDNER from the great State of Colo-
rado. CORY GARDNER and I first met in 
the House of Representatives in 2011. I 
had just started my fifth term rep-
resenting Maryland in the House, and 
then-Congressman GARDNER was being 
sworn in for the first time as the Mem-
ber from Colorado’s fourth. We got to 
know each other even better in 2017, 
when I joined the U.S. Senate and 
served as the chair of the Democratic 
Senatorial Campaign Committee oppo-
site 
Senator 
GARDNER, 
who 
was 
chairing the National Republican Sen-
atorial Committee. We didn’t always 
agree on how best to move our country 
forward, but I have no doubt in my 
mind that Senator GARDNER has served 
our country with unceasing optimism 
and love for his State. He possesses a 
profound and deep respect for our Na-
tion’s history and institutions. I send 
my best to him and his family.

GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the Fed-
eral Government brought in $3.3 tril-
lion in revenue last year and spent $6.6 
trillion for a record-setting $3.3 trillion 
deficit. If you are looking for more 
COVID bailout money, we don’t have 
any. The coffers are bare. We have no 
rainy day fund. We have no savings ac-
count. Congress has spent all of the 
money. Congress spent all of the 
money a long time ago. 
The economic damage from the pan-
demic is not the reason for this run-
away spending. This has gone on for 
decades. Today’s money is gone, so 
Congress 
is 
spending 
tomorrow’s 
money. When you look at a graph of 
our projected spending, you see a big 
spike this year. The spike is a moun-
tain of money doled out to pay for the 
economic ruin of the government man-
dates. 
When we talk about spending tomor-
row’s money, this is not just money we 
will need next month; this is money we 
will need in a decade—money we will 
need in one, two, and three generations 
from now. For national defense. For in-
frastructure. This is money that your 
children and grandchildren will pay 
back with interest, and it is going up 
by more than a trillion dollars every 
year. 
Instead of enjoying the same wealth 
and opportunity that we have enjoyed 
in this country, our children will be 
stuck paying our bills—with interest. 
Every 
taxpaying 
American 
already 
owes $136,754 today, and they are star-
ing at a red-ink projection into the fu-
ture. We are $27 trillion in total debt 
today. How do we expect a child to 
have 
economic 
opportunity 
when 
crushing debt is their inheritance from 
Congress? 
The numbers are mind-boggling. It is 
hard to conceive of a billion dollars, 
much less a trillion dollars. How big is 
a billion? Well, a billion seconds ago 
was 1988 and Reagan was still Presi-
dent. A billion minutes ago, Jesus 
walked the shore of the Sea of Galilee. 
A billion hours ago, man still lived in 
caves. But a billion dollars ago—as 
spent by the Federal Government— 
that was just 80 minutes ago. That is 
right, the Federal Government spends 
a billion dollars every 80 minutes. 
All of this should be setting off alarm 
bells, but the only alarm bells in Con-
gress are sounding the alarm for more 
spending, more debt. No cuts. No off-
sets. No pay-fors. No prioritization. 
Just debt. Spend all the money and 
leave the future to figure itself out. 
Our budget deficit for 2020 was $3.3 tril-
lion, and we are projected to have a 
deficit of nearly $2 trillion in 2021. And 
that was before any additional spend-
ing on another round of coronavirus 
bailout money. 
By refusing to acknowledge the debt 
crisis, we are only hastening the day of 
economic reckoning. Total debt was 55 
percent of GDP 20 years ago; today it is 
128 percent. The World Bank estimates 
there is a tipping point of debt to GDP 
at about 77 percent. Every percentage 
point after that costs about one-tenth 
of 1 percent of economic growth. We 
are 
at 
128 
percent, 
which 
means 
Congress’s continued borrowing is cost-
ing the U.S. economy about 8 percent 
growth each year. 
We are borrowing and worsening this 
debt crisis, in part, because too many 
Governors and mayors have imposed 
heavyhanded restrictions that crush 
businesses. The pandemic itself was 
disruptive, but Congress is being asked 
to help perpetuate lockdowns and shut-
downs 
through 
bailouts 
and 
debt. 
Every bailout dollar printed and passed 
out to Governors only allows these tin 
pot 
dictators 
to 
perpetuate 
the 
lockdowns. Their rules are arbitrary, 
and Governors and mayors across the 
country are picking winners and losers. 
Businesses, some that have been in 
families for generations, are being 
wiped out because they are not not al-
lowed to offer their services. Res-
taurants have to close for indoor din-
ing, but then they are told they can 
stay open at limited capacity, but then 
they are told they have to close again, 
but then they are told that they can re-
open but bars have to close. Confusing 
doesn’t explain the half of it. 
Bars are told they can only serve al-
cohol if people are sitting and not 
standing and only if they have heavy 
foods on their menus. Restaurants are 
told they can serve outdoors, then have 
that permission revoked after they 
have sunk time and money converting 
their restaurant to outdoor service. 
But a caterer can still serve outdoors. 
Businesses are told they have to 
close at an arbitrary time determined 
by government officials, as though the 
virus only comes out late at night. A 
business in one Zip Code can be open 
but one in the adjoining Zip Code has 
to close, as if the virus can’t cross an 
imaginary line. 
Airlines are allowed to fly but hotels 
have to limit their occupancy, so you 
may not have anywhere to stay when 
you get there. 
Mom-and-pop stores and specialty 
stores are forced to close, but big box 
competitors are allowed to stay open 
because they have a grocery aisle. But 
then other States roped off random sec-
tions of stores. How is any business ex-
pected to survive that kind of regula-
tion? 
Meanwhile, many schools remain 
closed despite overwhelming evidence 
showing kids can safely learn in-person 
with basic precautions, which means 
parents can’t go to work, which has 
forced many parents to leave their jobs 
to take care of home-bound kids. Now 
they have no income because the gov-
ernment forced them to leave their 
jobs to take care of their kids, and 
many kids are struggling with an im-
provised virtual school. 
The need for help is real. I hear it 
every day from Kentuckians and across 
the country. But it is clear that gov-
ernment has worsened the economic 
damage and acted as the biggest obsta-
cle to economic recovery. 
There is no free money to get us out 
of this situation. In fact, there is no 
more money at all. The answer is not 
printing up and distributing ‘‘free 
money’’ to everyone. The answer is im-
mediately opening the economy. We 
can choose to let our economies open, 
with guidance and precautions but not 
obstruction. Let people rebuild their 
livelihoods. Reopen our schools so kids 
can learn and parents can go back to 
working and earning a living. Congress 
should do away with automatic spend-
ing increases and scrutinize where in 
our budget we can find savings to pay 
for the pressing needs arising from the 
pandemic. This is what I prefer and 
what I have proposed. Or Congress can 
follow the status quo: Congress can 
continue to borrow from our kids—the 
same ones whom we have locked out of 
schools. Congress can keep enabling 
the shutting down of business by force, 
spend all of today’s money and all of 
tomorrow’s money. Then good luck fig-
uring out how to pay for all of this 
massive debt. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. This 
debt crisis is a preventable crisis. It is 
not too late to change our course. Cut 
unnecessary spending, eliminate waste, 
stop fighting a $50 billion per year for-
ever war in Afghanistan. Make the 
hard decisions now. We can’t keep pre-
tending that more debt is a sustainable 
policy course. Leadership is not pass-
ing on the problem to someone who 
can’t protest, leadership is making the

I will continue to sound the alarm 
until we change our course here in Con-

RECOGNIZING THE SHEPHERD 
COMMUNITY CENTER 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise to 
recognize Shepherd Community Cen-
ter’s 35 years of service to individuals 
and families on the near eastside of In-
dianapolis, IN. Since 1985, this faith- 
based, inner-city ministry has operated 
with the mission to ‘‘break the cycle of 
poverty on the near Eastside of Indian-
apolis by engaging and empowering the 
community to cultivate healthy chil-
dren, strong families, and vibrant 
neighborhoods through a Christ-cen-
tered approach that meets the phys-
ical, emotional, spiritual, and aca-
demic needs of our neighbors.’’ 
Shepherd Community Center serves 
the 
near 
Eastside 
of 
Indianapolis, 
where poverty rates in the area reach 
as high as 38.6 percent and 8 of 10 chil-
dren rely on school as their primary 
source of food during the week. Shep-
herd provides hope and support to its 
neighbors through a unique and holis-
tic approach Shepherd calls its Con-
tinuum of Care. The Continuum of Care 
is a full set of programs that allows 
Shepherd to be continuously engaged 
in the lives of neighborhood children, 
teens, and their parents. It is designed 
to help area families overcome the 
challenges they may be facing in all 
areas: physical, emotional, spiritual, 
and academic. 
Shepherd’s approach has consistently 
yielded positive results, and families in 
its programs have become stronger 
physically, 
emotionally, 
spiritually, 
and financially. Shepherd’s students 
also attain higher academic achieve-
ment. In an area where only 33 percent 
of entering freshmen graduate high 
school and only 75 percent of those who 
graduate go on to college, nearly 90 
percent of Shepherd’s seniors graduate 
and go on to college, job training, or 
the military. 
Shepherd’s history dates to the fall 
of 1984, when the Westside Church of 
the Nazarene sent a group of volun-
teers to Central Nazarene Church to 
serve a Thanksgiving meal. In Feb-
ruary 1985, that simple meal blossomed 
into an organization: Central Nazarene 
Mission. A few years later, the name 
was changed to Shepherd Community 
Center. Reverend Dean Cowles was the 
founding director and served in that 
role for Shepherd’s first 4 years. Rev-
erend John Hay, Jr. served for the next 
few years. Following Hay’s departure, 
Cowles returned and served yet another 
4 years. After a few years of transition, 
Reverend Jay Height was named execu-
tive director in 1998 and continues to 
serve today. 
And my friend Reverend Height has 
been a tireless champion for families 
on the near Eastside every day since 
then. In a 35th anniversary year when 
the COVID–19 pandemic compounded 
the challenges facing families in the 
area, Reverend Height and the Shep-
herd Community team met those chal-
lenges head on, and arm-in-arm with 
their neighbors. In a recent article in 
the Indianapolis Star, Reverend Height 
said, ‘‘Hope is a precious commodity. 
When it’s lost, the consequences for 
human life are devastating.’’ 
I agree, Reverend Height. And I know 
the countless families of Indianapolis 
that Shepherd has served in its first 35 
years are eternally grateful that Shep-
herd has been a custodian of hope for 
our capital city. On behalf of those 
families and the State of Indiana, I 
congratulate you on the 35th anniver-
sary of Shepherd Community Center, I 
thank everyone who has worked and 
sacrificed in order to bless their neigh-
borhoods through the work of Shepherd 
and wish the Shepherd Community 
Center all the best as it carries on that 
good and crucial work.

TRIBUTE TO MIKE ANDERSON 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President. I 
would like recognize a critical member 
of my staff, Mike Anderson, who left 
my office in August to pursue a legal 
career his hometown of Anchorage, AK, 
something he has aspired to do since a 
young age. 
Communications director was a more 
than appropriate title for Mike. He di-
rected so much of our communication, 
both internally and externally. You 
would often find Mike going from staff 
member to staff member, asking them 
questions, relaying information from 
one team to the next. In our office, if 
you had a question about what any-
body was up to, you would ask Mike. 
That is a special quality. We miss it 
very much. 
Mike is no stranger to Alaska polit-
ical offices. Fresh out of college at the 
University of Alaska Fairbanks, he 
took a job with Congressman DON 
YOUNG, and then worked for Senator 
LISA MURKOWSKI. In 2014, I was looking 
for someone to help with communica-
tions on my campaign. It was the first 
time I had run for office, and I was run-
ning against an incumbent with big 
name recognition. Mike came on board. 
He took a chance on me—it is some-
thing I will never forget. 
He had been taking law classes at 
night at the Catholic University of 
America for the past few years working 
in my office. He balanced it all, was on 
the clock around the clock, and did it 
with grace and humor. He was our of-
fice communicator, but he was also the 
office friend—the person you would go 
to for advice on things big and small, 
the person you would call on for an as-
sist if you needed to move. It helped 
that he is a short 6′8″. Mike always 
showed up. Working together—as one 
team, one fight—we got big things done 
for our State. 
Mike is going to make a great lawyer 
in Alaska. As a State, we have so much 
potential: the biggest fisheries in the 
country, the largest energy fields, an 
array of military complexes, and fas-
cinating Alaska Native legal issues. 
More than anything, Alaska needs good 
leaders with integrity—hard-working 
people like Mike, who love their State 
and give it their all. We haven’t seen 
the last of Mike. He will always be a 
part of our team. And I am sure that 
we will always work together to make 
sure Alaska thrives. 
So good luck to you, Mike. You left 
a mark and a hole. Best wishes on a 
bright future ahead.

TRIBUTE TO KAREN ROBB 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to recognize an extraordinary 
member of my staff who retired from 
the Senate earlier this year, Karen 
Robb. 
For 15 years, Karen Robb served as a 
critical senior member of my staff, 
first in my House office and then in the 
Senate. Karen is a trusted adviser, 
skilled leader, and wonderful friend. 
Over the years she has been a key part-
ner in many of our successful legisla-
tive initiatives and was a tireless advo-
cate for the people of Maryland. A 
humble and committed public servant, 
Karen is driven by her deep-rooted val-
ues and a strong commitment to public 
service and the institution of the Con-
gress. 
Karen was already a seasoned pro on 
Capitol Hill when she joined my team 
as chief of staff in the House of Rep-
resentatives office 15 years ago. She 
had previously served as Deputy As-
sistant to President Clinton in the Of-
fice of Legislative Affairs, chief of staff 
to Senator John Edwards, democratic 
staff director for the Senate Judiciary 
Committee under then-Senator Joe 
Biden, and chief counsel to Senator 
Dennis DeConcini. Her extensive expe-
rience in both the legislative and exec-
utive branches helped us achieve sig-
nificant victories for Maryland and 
pass priorities important to the Amer-
ican people. 
An attorney, Karen has always iden-
tified first as a policy wonk with par-
ticularly deep knowledge of the judici-
ary, and I drafted her into becoming an 
expert on campaign finance reform and 
election issues. She worked with Fred 
Wertheimer of Democracy 21 and other 
reformers to change the political fi-
nance system through legislation and 
the courts. Karen worked tirelessly to 
help draft the Lobbying Transparency 
Act, legislation I introduced to shine a 
light on lobbyist bundling of political 
contributions that ultimately became 
law as part of an ethics reform pack-
age. Many Members of Congress op-
posed the effort, but it was the right 
thing to do, and with the support of 
Speaker PELOSI, it passed in the House, 
while Senators Obama and Feingold 
pushed it through in the Senate. 
After the Supreme Court’s notorious 
decision in Citizens United v. Federal 
Election Commission, we worked for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7712 
December 18, 2020 
months to write and pass the DIS-
CLOSE Act in the House of Representa-
tives. The DISCLOSE Act is based on 
the idea that voters have a right to 
know what individuals and interests 
are financing the political advertise-
ments trying to influence their votes. 
It was vigorously opposed by deep- 
pocketed special interests that prefer 
to operate in the dark and hide behind 
front organizations, but Karen kept at 
it. She spent countless hours negoti-
ating every comma and definition. 
With perseverance, we succeeded in 
eking out a victory of 219 to 206 in the 
House. The Senate version failed by 
one vote, and we have been trying to 
pass it here ever since. 
Karen helped us pass legislation pro-
tecting whistleblowers who put their 
careers at risk to expose wrongdoing— 
an issue that has become even more 
important in recent years. She recog-
nized that the success of our democ-
racy depends on people’s willingness to 
speak truth to power, and it is our job 
to advance the truth for the public 
good. 
During my time in the House, Karen 
served in a number of key roles, includ-
ing as policy director of my Assistant 
to the Speaker’s Office, where she ac-
companied me to all the House leader-
ship meetings as well as the House- 
Senate bicameral leadership meetings. 
She always had good insights and was 
respected by all. Karen also served as 
counsel on the House Budget Com-
mittee during the time I was the rank-
ing member on the committee and 
played an important role during my 
participation in the bipartisan budget 
negotiations 
headed 
by 
then-Vice 
President Biden. During our tenure on 
the House Budget Committee, House 
Democrats proposed budgets to expand 
economic opportunity for all, strength-
en Medicare and Social Security, put 
our country on a path for strong jobs 
and wage growth, and much more. She 
was at the center of these efforts and 
understood that budgets are more than 
just lists of programs and tabulations 
of dollars and cents—they represent 
the priorities and values of the Amer-
ican people. 
Upon arriving in the Senate, Karen’s 
deep roots in the Upper Chamber got us 
off to a quick start. She set up our of-
fice and had an insider’s knowledge of 
how to navigate many of the Senate’s 
byzantine traditions and processes. 
With her wise guidance, we were able 
to achieve much for Marylanders in a 
short time. 
Karen’s love for the twists and turns 
of lawmaking and politics is surpassed 
only by her love of children and ani-
mals—her first stop after leaving our 
office was the Nyumbani AIDS orphan-
age in Kenya, where she has served as 
a guardian angel for many years. She 
has helped to raise funds for supplies 
for the orphanage while taking a direct 
personal interest in the children who 
live there, sharing photos and stories 
and delighting in their growth and 
progress. Karen’s charitable efforts 
have never been abstract—she has per-
sonally hauled supplies on her trips to 
Nyumbani, and, in the wake of Hurri-
cane Katrina, she jumped in her car 
and drove to New Orleans to help res-
cue and rehome animals. While a loss 
to the Senate, Karen’s retirement gives 
her more time to spend on the many 
causes close to her heart, including to 
her continued service on the Nyumbani 
board of directors. 
Karen Robb was not a bystander to 
any project she embarked on. She was 
hands-on, all in, and whatever it takes. 
From the smallest detail to the biggest 
obstacle, she threw herself into her 
work and our lives. She is a compas-
sionate person who always puts others 
first. My family and I will be forever 
grateful for Karen’s friendship, many 
talents, and loyal service. Our entire 
team will miss her and the wisdom she 
brought to the often-hectic world of 
congressional offices. I wish her the 
very best as she embarks on her new 
adventures.

penses for the intended length of the

bursements made to an eligible child care 
provider to carry out the Child Care and De-
velopment Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.

Subtitle B—Minority Business Resiliency 
SEC. 4201. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Minor-
ity Business Resiliency Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 4202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) During times of economic downturn or 
recession, communities of color, and busi-
nesses within those communities, are gen-
erally more adversely affected, which re-
quires an expansion of the ability of the Fed-
eral Government to infuse resources into 
those communities. 
(2) Despite the growth in the number of mi-
nority business enterprises, gaps remain 
with respect to key metrics for those enter-
prises, such as access to capital, revenue, 
number of employees, and survival rate. Spe-
cifically— 
(A) according to the Department of Com-
merce, minority business enterprises are 2 to 
3 times more likely to be denied loans than 
non-minority business enterprises; 
(B) according to the Bureau of the Census, 
the average non-minority business enterprise 
reports receipts that are more than 3 times 
higher than receipts reported by the average 
minority business enterprise; and 
(C) according to the Kauffman Founda-
tion— 
(i) minority business enterprises are 1⁄2 as 
likely to employ individuals, as compared 
with non-minority business enterprises; and 
(ii) if minorities started and owned busi-
nesses at the same rate as non-minorities, 
the United States economy would have more 
than 1,000,000 additional employer businesses 
and more than 9,500,000 additional jobs. 
(3) Because of the conditions described in 
paragraph (2), it is in the interest of the 
United States and the economy of the United

States to expeditiously ameliorate the dis-
parities that minority business enterprises 
experience. 
(4) Many individuals who own minority 
business enterprises are socially disadvan-
taged because those individuals identify as 
members of certain groups that have suffered

(A) Black or African American;

lander.

circumstances described in paragraph (4) are

nomic disadvantage in the United States,

wealth gap in the United States. 
(6) While other Federal agencies focus only 
on small businesses and businesses that rep-
resent a broader demographic than solely

focuses exclusively on— 
(A) the unique needs of minority business

(B) enhancing the capacity of minority 
business enterprises.

(1) The Department of the Treasury, Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,

Comptroller of the Currency, Federal De-
posit Insurance Corporation, National Credit

gage with, and utilize minority depository

nancial institutions in the near term, espe-
cially as they carry out programs to respond 
to the COVID–19 pandemic, and the long 
term. 
(2) The Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System should, consistent with its 
mandates, work to increase lending by mi-
nority depository institutions and commu-
nity development financial institutions to 
underserved communities, and when appro-
priate, should work with the Department of 
the Treasury to increase lending by minority 
depository institutions and community de-
velopment financial institutions to under-
served communities. 
(3) The Department of the Treasury and 
prudential regulators should establish a stra-
tegic plan identifying concrete steps that 
they can take to support existing minority 
depository institutions, as well as the forma-
tion of new minority depository institutions 
consistent with the goals established in the 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, 
and Enforcement Act of 1989 to preserve and 
promote minority depository institutions. 
(4) Congress should increase funding and 
make other enhancements, including those 
provided by this legislation, to enhance the 
effectiveness of the CDFI Fund, especially 
reforms to support minority-owned and mi-
nority led CDFIs in times of crisis and be-
yond. 
(5) Congress should conduct robust and on-
going oversight of the Department of the 
Treasury, CDFI Fund, Federal prudential 
regulators, SBA, and other Federal agencies 
to ensure they fulfill their obligations under 
the law as well as implement this title and 
other laws in a manner that supports and 
fully utilizes minority depository institu-
tions and community development financial 
intuitions, as appropriate. 
(6) The investments made by the Secretary 
of the Treasury under this subtitle and the 
amendments made by this subtitle should be 
designed to maximize the benefit to low- and 
moderate-income and minority communities 
and contemplate losses to capital of the 
Treasury.

SEC. 4507. ENSURING DIVERSITY IN COMMUNITY 
BANKING. 
(a) SENSE
OF CONGRESS
ON FUNDING
THE 
LOAN-LOSS RESERVE FUND FOR SMALL DOLLAR 
LOANS.—The sense of Congress is the fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Community Development Financial 
Institutions Fund (referred to in this sub-
section as the ‘‘CDFI Fund’’) is an agency of 
the Department of the Treasury, and was es-
tablished under section 104(a) of the Commu-
nity Development Banking and Financial In-
stitutions Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4703(a)). The 
mission of the CDFI Fund is ‘‘to expand eco-
nomic opportunity for underserved people 
and communities by supporting the growth 
and capacity of a national network of com-
munity development lenders, investors, and 
financial service providers’’. A community 
development financial institution is a spe-
cialized financial institution serving low-in-
come communities and a Community Devel-
opment Entity (referred to in this subsection 
as a ‘‘CDE’’) is a domestic corporation or 
partnership that is an intermediary vehicle 
for the provision of loans, investments, or fi-
nancial counseling in low-income commu-
nities. The CDFI Fund certifies community 
development 
financial 
institutions 
and 
CDEs. Becoming a certified community de-
velopment financial institution or CDE al-
lows organizations to participate in various 
CDFI Fund programs as follows: 
(A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, 
which provides FDIC-insured depository in-
stitutions awards for a demonstrated in-
crease in lending and investments in dis-
tressed communities and community devel-
opment financial institutions. 
(B) The CDFI Program, which provides fi-
nancial and technical assistance awards to 
community development financial institu-
tions to reinvest in the CDFI Fund, and to 
build the capacity of the CDFI Fund, includ-
ing financing product development and loan 
loss reserves. 
(C) The Native American CDFI Assistance 
Program, which provides CDFIs and spon-
soring entities Financial and Technical As-
sistance awards to increase lending and grow 
the number of CDFIs owned by Native Amer-
icans to help build capacity of such CDFIs. 
(D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, 
which provides tax credits for making equity 
investments in CDEs that stimulate capital 
investments in low-income communities. 
(E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which pro-
vides awards to CDFIs and nonprofit afford-
able housing organizations to finance afford-
able housing solutions and related economic 
development activities. 
(F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a source 
of long-term, patient capital for CDFIs to ex-
pand lending and investment capacity for 
community and economic development pur-
poses. 
(2) The Department of the Treasury is au-
thorized to create multi-year grant programs 
designed to encourage low-to-moderate in-
come individuals to establish accounts at 
federally insured banks, and to improve low- 
to-moderate income individuals’ access to 
such accounts on reasonable terms. 
(3) Under this authority, grants to partici-
pants in CDFI Fund programs may be used 
for loan-loss reserves and to establish small- 
dollar loan programs by subsidizing related 
losses. These grants also allow for the pro-
viding recipients with the financial coun-
seling and education necessary to conduct 
transactions and manage their accounts. 
These loans provide low-cost alternatives to 
payday loans and other nontraditional forms 
of financing that often impose excessive in-
terest rates and fees on borrowers, and lead 
millions of people in the United States to 
fall into debt traps. Small-dollar loans can 
only be made pursuant to terms, conditions, 
and practices that are reasonable for the in-
dividual consumer obtaining the loan. 
(4) Program participation is restricted to 
eligible institutions, which are limited to or-
ganizations listed in section 501(c)(3) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt 
from tax under 501(a) of such Code, federally 
insured depository institutions, community 
development 
financial 
institutions 
and 
State, local, or Tribal governmental entities. 
(5) Since its founding, the CDFI Fund has 
awarded over $3,300,000,000 to CDFIs and 
CDEs and has allocated $54,000,000,000 in tax 
credits and $1,510,000,000 in bond guarantees. 
According to the CDFI Fund, some programs 
attract as much as $10 in private capital for 
every $1 invested by the CDFI Fund. The Ad-
ministration and Congress should prioritize 
appropriation of funds for the loan loss re-
serve fund and technical assistance programs 
administered by the CDFI Fund.

underfunded 
critical priorities like public health, child

acerbated by the pandemic, in areas like in 
child care, mental health and primary care,

helping to build long lasting wealth, health,

any qualified building shall not exceed the 
aggregate 
qualified 
rental 
reduction 
amounts which such agency estimates will 
occur over the credit period for eligible units 
within such building, based on reasonable es-
timates of rents, family incomes, and vacan-
cies in accordance with procedures estab-
lished by the State as part of its State rental 
reduction allocation plan. 
‘‘(C) SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS.— 
‘‘(i) NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS.—At least 25 
percent of the State rental reduction credit 
ceiling for any State for any calendar year 
shall be allocated to qualified buildings in 
which a qualified nonprofit organization (as 
defined in section 42(h)(5)(C)) owns (directly 
or through a partnership) an interest and 
materially participates (within the meaning 
of section 469(h)) in the operation of the 
building throughout the credit period. A 
State may waive or lower the requirement 
under this clause for any calendar year if it 
determines that meeting such requirement is 
not feasible. 
‘‘(ii) RURAL AREAS.— 
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—The State rental reduc-
tion credit ceiling for any State for any cal-
endar year shall be allocated to buildings in 
rural areas (as defined in section 520 of the 
Housing Act of 1949) in an amount which, as 
determined by the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development, bears the same ratio to 
such ceiling as the number of extremely low- 
income households with severe rent burdens 
in such rural areas bears to the total number 
of such households in the State. 
‘‘(II) ALTERNATIVE
5-YEAR
TESTING
PE-
RIOD.—In the case of the 5-calendar year pe-
riod beginning in 2021, a State shall not be 
treated as failing to meet the requirements 
of subclause (I) for any calendar year in such 
period if, as determined by the Secretary, 
the average annual amount allocated to such 
rural areas during such period meets such re-
quirements. 
‘‘(3) APPLICATION
OF
ALLOCATED
CREDIT 
AMOUNT.— 
‘‘(A) AMOUNT AVAILABLE TO TAXPAYER FOR 
ALL
MONTHS
IN
CREDIT
PERIOD.—Any rental 
reduction credit amount allocated to any

duction credit ceiling for any calendar year 
shall apply to such building for all months in 
the credit period ending during or after such 
calendar year. 
‘‘(B) CEILING FOR ALLOCATION YEAR REDUCED 
BY
ENTIRE
CREDIT
AMOUNT.—Any rental re-
duction credit amount allocated to any 
qualified building out of an allocating agen-
cy’s State rental reduction credit ceiling for 
any calendar year shall reduce such ceiling 
for such calendar year by the entire amount 
so allocated for all months in the credit pe-
riod (as determined on the basis of the esti-
mates under paragraph (2)(B)) and no reduc-
tion shall be made in such agency’s State 
rental reduction credit ceiling for any subse-
quent calendar year by reason of such alloca-
tion. 
‘‘(4) STATE RENTAL REDUCTION CREDIT CEIL-
ING.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The State rental reduc-
tion credit ceiling applicable to any State 
for any calendar year shall be an amount 
equal to the sum of— 
‘‘(i) the greater of— 
‘‘(I) the per capita dollar amount multi-
plied by the State population, or 
‘‘(II) the minimum ceiling amount, plus 
‘‘(ii) the amount of the State rental reduc-
tion credit ceiling returned in the calendar 
year. 
‘‘(B) RETURN OF STATE CEILING AMOUNTS.— 
For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), except 
as provided in subsection (d)(2), the amount 
of the State rental reduction credit ceiling 
returned in a calendar year equals the 
amount 
of 
the 
rental 
reduction 
credit 
amount allocated to any building which, 
after the close of the calendar year for which 
the allocation is made— 
‘‘(i) is canceled by mutual consent of the 
rental reduction credit agency and the tax-
payer because the estimates made under 
paragraph (2)(B) were substantially incor-
rect, or 
‘‘(ii) is canceled by the rental reduction 
credit agency because the taxpayer violates 
the qualified rental reduction agreement 
and, under the terms of the agreement, the 
rental reduction credit agency is authorized 
to cancel all (or any portion) of the alloca-
tion by reason of the violation. 
‘‘(C) PER CAPITA DOLLAR AMOUNT; MINIMUM 
CEILING AMOUNT.—For purposes of this para-
graph— 
‘‘(i) PER CAPITA DOLLAR AMOUNT.—The per 
capita dollar amount is— 
‘‘(I) for each of calendar years 2021, 2022, 
2023, 2024, and 2025, $14.35, and 
‘‘(II) for any calendar year after 2025, zero. 
‘‘(ii) MINIMUM CEILING AMOUNT.—The min-
imum ceiling amount is— 
‘‘(I) for each of calendar years 2021, 2022, 
2023, 2024, and 2025, $25,000,000, and 
‘‘(II) for any calendar year after 2025, zero.

paragraph, population shall be determined in 
accordance with section 146(j). 
‘‘(E) UNUSED RENTAL REDUCTION CREDIT AL-
LOCATED AMONG CERTAIN STATES.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The unused rental reduc-
tion credit of a State for any calendar year 
shall be assigned to the Secretary for alloca-
tion among qualified States for the suc-
ceeding calendar year. 
‘‘(ii) UNUSED RENTAL REDUCTION CREDIT.— 
For purposes of this subparagraph, the un-
used rental reduction credit of a State for 
any calendar year is the excess (if any) of— 
‘‘(I) the State rental reduction credit ceil-
ing for the year preceding such year, over 
‘‘(II) the aggregate rental reduction credit 
amounts allocated for such year. 
‘‘(iii) FORMULA FOR ALLOCATION OF UNUSED 
CREDIT
AMONG
QUALIFIED
STATES.—The 
amount allocated under this subparagraph to 
a qualified State for any calendar year shall 
be the amount determined by the Secretary 
to bear the same ratio to the aggregate un-
used rental reduction credits of all States for 
the preceding calendar year as such State’s 
population for the calendar year bears to the 
population of all qualified States for the cal-
endar year. For purposes of the preceding 
sentence, population shall be determined in 
accordance with section 146(j). 
‘‘(iv) QUALIFIED
STATE.—For purposes of 
this subparagraph, the term ‘qualified State’ 
means, with respect to a calendar year, any 
State— 
‘‘(I) which allocated its entire State rental 
reduction credit ceiling for the preceding 
calendar year, and 
‘‘(II) for which a request is made (at such 
time and in such manner as the Secretary 
may prescribe) to receive an allocation 
under clause (iii). 
‘‘(5) OTHER
DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of 
this section— 
‘‘(A) RENTAL REDUCTION CREDIT AGENCY.— 
The term ‘rental reduction credit agency’ 
means any agency authorized by a State to

shall include the jurisdictions within the 
State where the agency may allocate rental 
reduction credit amounts. 
‘‘(B) POSSESSIONS TREATED AS STATES.—The

United States. 
‘‘(C) FAMILY.—The term ‘family’ has the 
same meaning as when used in the United

‘‘(d) 
MODIFICATIONS
TO
CORRECT
INAC-
CURATE AMOUNTS DUE
TO INCORRECT ESTI-
MATES.— 
‘‘(1) ESTABLISHMENT OF RESERVES.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Each rental reduction 
credit agency of a State shall establish a re-
serve for the transfer and reallocation of 
amounts pursuant to this paragraph, and 
notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, the rental reduction credit amount 
allocated to any building by such agency 
shall be zero unless such agency has in effect 
such a reserve at the time of the allocation 
of such credit amount. 
‘‘(B) TRANSFERS TO RESERVE.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—If, for any taxable year, 
a taxpayer would (but for this subparagraph) 
not be able to use the entire rental reduction 
credit amount allocated to a qualified build-
ing by a rental reduction credit agency of a 
State for the taxable year because of a rental 
reduction shortfall, then the taxpayer shall 
for the taxable year transfer to the reserve 
established by such agency under subpara-
graph (A) an amount equal to such rental re-
duction shortfall. 
‘‘(ii) RENTAL
REDUCTION
SHORTFALL.—For 
purposes of this subparagraph, the rental re-
duction shortfall for any qualified building 
for any taxable year is the amount by which 
the aggregate amount of the excesses deter-
mined under subsection (b)(1) for all eligible 
units within such building are less than such 
aggregate amount estimated under sub-
section (c)(2)(B) for the taxable year. 
‘‘(iii) 
TREATMENT
OF
TRANSFERRED 
AMOUNT.—For 
purposes 
of 
subsection 
(a)(2)(A), the aggregate qualified rental re-
duction amounts for all eligible units within 
a qualified building with respect to which 
clause (i) applies for any taxable year shall 
be increased by an amount equal to the ap-
plicable percentage (determined under sub-
section (e)(1) for the building) of the amount 
of the transfer to the reserve under clause (i) 
with respect to such building for such tax-
able year. 
‘‘(C) REALLOCATION
OF
AMOUNTS
TRANS-
FERRED.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—If, for any taxable year— 
‘‘(I) the aggregate qualified rental reduc-
tion amounts for all eligible units within a 
qualified building for the taxable year exceed 
‘‘(II) the rental reduction credit amount al-
located to such building by a rental reduc-
tion credit agency of a State for the taxable 
year (determined after any increase under 
paragraph (2)), 
the rental reduction credit agency shall, 
upon application of the taxpayer, pay to the 
taxpayer from the reserve established by 
such agency under subparagraph (A) the 
amount which, when multiplied by the appli-
cable percentage (determined under sub-
section (e)(1) for the building), equals such 
excess. If the amount in the reserve is less 
than the amounts requested by all taxpayers 
for taxable years ending within the same cal-
endar year, the agency shall ratably reduce 
the amount of each payment otherwise re-
quired to be made. 
‘‘(ii) EXCESS RESERVE AMOUNTS.—If a rental 
reduction credit agency of a State deter-
mines that the balance in its reserve is in ex-
cess of the amounts reasonably needed over 
the following 5 calendar years to make pay-
ments under clause (i), the agency may with-
draw such excess but only to— 
‘‘(I) reduce the rental payments of eligible 
tenants in a qualified building in units other 
than eligible units, or of eligible tenants in 
units in a building other than a qualified 
building, to amounts no higher than the sum 
of rental payments required for eligible ten-
ants in qualified buildings under subsection 
(b)(3) and any rental charges to such tenants 
in excess of the market rent standard; or 
‘‘(II) address maintenance and repair needs 
in qualified buildings that cannot reasonably 
be met using other resources available to the 
owners of such buildings.

December 18, 2020 
‘‘(D) ADMINISTRATION.—Each rental reduc-
tion credit agency of a State shall establish 
procedures for the timing and manner of 
transfers and payments made under this 
paragraph. 
‘‘(E) SPECIAL RULE FOR PROJECTS.—In the 
case of a rental reduction credit allocated to 
a project consisting of more than 1 qualified 
building, a taxpayer may elect to have this 
paragraph apply as if all such buildings were 
1 qualified building if the applicable percent-
age for each such building is the same. 
‘‘(F) ALTERNATIVE
METHODS
OF
TRANSFER 
AND REALLOCATION.—Upon request to, and ap-
proval by, the Secretary, a State may estab-
lish an alternative method for the transfer 
and reallocation of amounts otherwise re-
quired to be transferred to, and allocated 
from, a reserve under this paragraph. Any 
State adopting an alternative method under 
this subparagraph shall, at such time and in 
such manner as the Secretary prescribes, 
provide to the Secretary and the Secretary 
of Housing and Urban Development detailed 
reports on the operation of such method, in-
cluding providing such information as such 
Secretaries may require. 
‘‘(2) ALLOCATION OF RETURNED STATE CEIL-
ING AMOUNTS.—In the case of any rental re-
duction credit amount allocated to a quali-
fied building which is canceled as provided in 
subsection (c)(4)((B)(i), the rental reduction 
credit agency may, in lieu of treating such 
allocation as a returned credit amount under 
subsection (c)(4)(A)(ii), elect to allocate, 
upon the request of the taxpayer, such 
amount to any other qualified building for 
which the credit amount allocated in any 
preceding calendar year was too small be-
cause the estimates made under subsection 
(c)(2)(B) were substantially incorrect. 
‘‘(3) RENTING TO NONELIGIBLE TENANTS.—If, 
after the application of paragraphs (1)(C) (or 
any similar reallocation under paragraph 
(1)(F)) and (2), a rental reduction credit 
agency of a State determines that, because 
of the incorrect estimates under subsection 
(c)(2)(B), the aggregate qualified rental re-
duction amounts for all eligible units within 
a qualified building will (on an ongoing 
basis) exceed the rental reduction credit 
amount allocated to such building, a tax-
payer may elect, subject to subsection (g)(2) 
and only to the extent necessary to elimi-
nate such excess, rent vacant eligible units 
without regard to the requirements that 
such units be rented only to eligible tenants 
and at the rental rate determined under sub-
section (b)(3). 
‘‘(e) TERMS RELATING

building. 
‘‘(B) HIGHER PERCENTAGE FOR HIGH-OPPOR-
TUNITY AREAS.—The rental reduction credit 
agency may set a percentage under subpara-
graph (A) up to 120 percent for any qualified 
building which—

rental reduction credit agency may provide a 
credit period for any qualified building 
which is less than 15 years. 
‘‘(3) ELIGIBLE UNIT.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘eligible unit’

‘‘(ii) the rent of which for any month 
equals 30 percent of the monthly family in-
come of the residents of such unit (as deter-
mined under paragraph (5)), 
‘‘(iii) with respect to which the tenant is 
not concurrently receiving rental assistance 
under any other Federal program, and 
‘‘(iv) which is certified to the rental reduc-
tion credit agency as an eligible unit for pur-
poses of this section and the qualified rental 
reduction agreement. 
Notwithstanding clause (iii), a State may 
provide in its State rental reduction alloca-
tion plan that an eligible unit shall also not 
include a unit with respect to which any 
resident is receiving rental assistance under 
a State or local program. 
‘‘(B) LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF UNITS.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—The number of units 
which may be certified as eligible units with 
respect to any qualified building under sub-
paragraph (A)(iv) at any time shall not ex-
ceed the greater of— 
‘‘(I) 40 percent of the total units in such 
building, or 
‘‘(II) 25 units. 
In the case of an allocation to a project 
under subsection (c)(1)(B), the limitation 
under the preceding sentence shall be applied 
on a project basis and the certification of 
such eligible units shall be allocated to each 
building in the project, except that if build-
ings in such project are on non-contiguous 
tracts of land, buildings on each such tract 
shall be treated as a separate project for pur-
poses of applying this sentence. 
‘‘(ii) BUILDINGS
RECEIVING
PREVIOUS
FED-
ERAL
RENTAL
ASSISTANCE.—If, at any time 
prior to the entering into of a qualified rent-
al reduction agreement with respect to a 
qualified building, tenants in units within 
such building had been receiving project- 
based rental assistance under any other Fed-
eral program, then, notwithstanding clause 
(i), the maximum number of units which 
may be certified as eligible units with re-
spect to the building under subparagraph 
(A)(iv) shall not be less than the sum of— 
‘‘(I) the maximum number of units in the 
building previously receiving such assistance 
at any time before the agreement takes ef-
fect, plus 
‘‘(II) the amount determined under clause 
(i) without taking into account the units de-
scribed in subclause (I). 
‘‘(4) ELIGIBLE TENANT.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘eligible ten-
ant’ means any individual if the individual’s

or 
‘‘(ii) the applicable poverty line for a fam-
ily of the size involved. 
‘‘(B) TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WHOSE IN-
COMES RISE ABOVE LIMIT.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding an in-
crease in the family income of residents of a 
unit above the income limitation applicable 
under subparagraph (A), such residents shall 
continue to be treated as eligible tenants if 
the family income of such residents initially 
met such income limitation and such unit 
continues to be certified as an eligible unit 
under this section. 
‘‘(ii) NO RENTAL REDUCTION FOR AT LEAST 2 
YEARS.—A qualified rental reduction agree-
ment with respect to a qualified building 
shall provide that if, by reason of an increase 
in family income described in clause (i), 
there is no qualified rental reduction amount 
with respect to the dwelling unit for 2 con-
secutive years, the taxpayer shall rent the 
next available unit to an eligible tenant 
(without regard to whether such unit is an 
eligible unit under this section). 
‘‘(C) APPLICABLE POVERTY LINE.—The term 
‘applicable poverty line’ means the most re-
cently published poverty line (within the 
meaning of section 2110(c)(5) of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397jj(c)(5))) as of the 
time of the determination as to whether an 
individual is an eligible tenant. 
‘‘(5) FAMILY INCOME.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Family income shall be 
determined in the same manner as under sec-
tion 8 of the United States Housing Act of 
1937. 
‘‘(B) TIME FOR DETERMINING INCOME.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
this subparagraph, family income shall be 
determined at least annually on the basis of 
income for the preceding calendar year. 
‘‘(ii) FAMILIES ON FIXED INCOME.—If at least 
90 percent of the family income of the resi-
dents of a unit at the time of any determina-
tion under clause (i) is derived from pay-
ments under title II or XVI of the Social Se-
curity Act (or any similar fixed income 
amounts specified by the Secretary), the tax-
payer may elect to treat such payments (or 
amounts) as the family income of such resi-
dents for the year of the determination and 
the 2 succeeding years, except that the tax-
payer shall, in such manner as the Secretary 
may prescribe, adjust such amount for in-
creases in the cost of living. 
‘‘(iii) INITIAL INCOME.—The Secretary may 
allow a State to provide that the family in-
come of residents at the time such residents 
first rent a unit in a qualified building may 
be determined on the basis of current or an-
ticipated income. 
‘‘(iv) SPECIAL RULES WHERE FAMILY INCOME 
IS REDUCED.— If residents of a unit establish 
(in such manner as the rental reduction cred-
it agency provides) that their family income 
has been reduced by at least 10 percent below 
such income for the determination year— 
‘‘(I) such residents may elect, at such time 
and in such manner as such agency may pre-
scribe, to have their family income redeter-
mined, and 
‘‘(II) clause (ii) shall not apply to any of 
the 2 succeeding years described in such 
clause which are specified in the election. 
‘‘(f) STATE RENTAL REDUCTION ALLOCATION 
PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) ADOPTION OF PLAN REQUIRED.—

of this section, the rental reduction credit 
amount allocated to any building shall be 
zero unless such amount was allocated pur-
suant to a State rental reduction allocation 
plan. 
Such plan shall only be adopted after such 
plan is made public and at least 60 days has 
been allowed for public comment. 
‘‘(B) STATE RENTAL REDUCTION ALLOCATION 
PLAN.—For purposes of this section, the term 
‘State rental reduction allocation plan’ 
means, with respect to any State, any plan 
of the State meeting the requirements of

agency of the State shall use in allocating 
the State rental reduction credit ceiling to 
eligible units within a building, 
‘‘(B) the plan provides that no credit allo-
cation shall be made which is not in accord-
ance with the criteria and priorities set forth 
under subparagraph (A) unless such agency 
provides a written explanation to the general 
public for any credit allocation which is not 
so made and the reasons why such allocation 
is necessary, and 
‘‘(C) the plan provides that such agency is 
required to prioritize the renewal of existing 
credit allocations at the time of the expira-
tion of the qualified rental reduction agree-
ment with respect to the allocation, includ-
ing, where appropriate, a commitment with-
in a qualified rental reduction agreement 
that the credit allocation will be renewed if 
the terms of the agreement have been met 
and sufficient new credit authority is avail-
able. 
‘‘(3) SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.—A plan shall 
meet the requirements of this paragraph 
only if— 
‘‘(A) the plan provides methods for deter-
mining— 
‘‘(i) the amount of rent which would be 
charged for a substantially similar unit in

noncompliance 
with 
habitability 
standards through regular site visits, 
‘‘(C) the plan requires a person receiving a 
credit allocation to report to the rental re-
duction credit agency such information as is 
necessary to ensure compliance with the pro-
visions of this section and the qualified rent-
al reduction agreement, and 
‘‘(D) the plan provides methods by which 
any excess reserve amounts which become 
available under subsection (d)(1)(C)(ii) will 
be used to reduce rental payments of eligible 
tenants or to address maintenance and re-
pair needs in qualified buildings, including 
how such assistance will be allocated among 
eligible tenants and qualified buildings.

MENT.—For purposes of this section— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘qualified rent-
al reduction agreement’ means, with respect

sufficient new credit authority is available 
for such new agreement, and

duction credit amount may not refuse to 
renew the lease of or evict (other than for 
good cause) a tenant of a unit who is not an 
eligible tenant at any time during the credit 
period and such unit shall not be treated as 
an eligible unit while such tenant resides 
there. 
‘‘(B) ONLY GOOD CAUSE EVICTIONS OF ELIGI-
BLE TENANTS.—A taxpayer receiving a rental 
reduction credit amount may not refuse to 
renew the lease of or evict (other than for

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
806—DE-
FENDING THE FREE EXERCISE 
OF RELIGION 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, 
Mr. TILLIS, Mr. WICKER, Mr. BOOZMAN, 
Mr. CRAMER, Mr. PERDUE, Mr. ROUNDS, 
Mr. RUBIO, Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mr. COT-
TON, Mr. HOEVEN, Mr. BRAUN, Mrs. 
LOEFFLER, Mr. CRUZ, Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, 
Mr. LANKFORD, Mr. BARRASSO, Mr. 
PAUL, and Mr. DAINES) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 806 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States clearly, plain-
ly, and unequivocally states that ‘‘Congress 
shall make no law respecting an establish-
ment of religion, or prohibiting the free ex-
ercise thereof’’; 
Whereas the constitutional protection of 
this bedrock principle of religious liberty 
was extended to the actions of the several 
States through the Fourteenth Amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States; 
Whereas, despite the clear prohibition 
against laws infringing upon the free exer-
cise of religion, houses of worship and reli-
gious organizations have been frequent tar-
gets of asymmetric restrictions by State and 
local 
government 
officials 
during 
the 
coronavirus pandemic; 
Whereas irrespective of compliance with 
mask mandates, social distancing, and other 
protective measures to limit the spread of 
the coronavirus, houses of worship and reli-
gious organizations have been subjected to 
size restrictions or outright bans on in-per-
son gatherings which severely infringe upon 
the right of their members to freely exercise 
their religion; 
Whereas, while houses of worship and reli-
gious organizations are subjected to severe 
restrictions under the guise of limiting the 
transmission of the coronavirus, businesses 
and secular activities enjoy substantially 
more favorable treatment by some State and 
local government officials, including— 
(1) New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 
who severely restricted the number of mem-
bers who could enter a church or synagogue 
in color-designated zones, but imposed no 
size restrictions on ‘‘essential’’ businesses, 
like acupuncture facilities, hardware stores, 
and liquor stores, and permitted other ‘‘non- 
essential’’ businesses to define their own size 
restrictions; 
(2) North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, 
who required worship services involving 
more than 10 people to be held outdoors un-
less a church demonstrated doing so would 
be ‘‘impossible’’, but commercial shopping 
centers could allow people into the stores 
without limitation; 
(3) California Governor Gavin Newsom, 
who prohibited or severely limited in-person 
worship services in counties with large num-
bers of coronavirus cases, but secular busi-
nesses and activities such as shopping malls, 
swap meets, and card rooms were permitted 
higher attendance; 
(4) New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who 
prohibited or severely restricted indoor serv-
ices by houses of worship because they were 
not deemed ‘‘essential’’, but commercial es-
tablishments like marijuana dispensaries 
and liquor stores were permitted to remain 
open; 
(5) Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak, who 
imposed strict numerical attendance caps on 
houses of worship because they were not 
deemed ‘‘essential’’, but allowed casinos and 
amusement parks to operate at half-capacity 
without specific numerical limits on people 
within those facilities; and 
(6) Mayor of the District of Columbia 
Muriel Bowser, who prohibited even outdoor 
religious services attended by more than 100 
people, regardless of compliance with face- 
covering and social distancing requirements, 
but actively encouraged and participated in 
crowded political demonstrations attended 
by thousands of individuals; 
Whereas the United States Supreme Court 
recently granted injunctive relief to 2 houses 
of worship in New York against the discrimi-
natory actions by New York Governor An-
drew Cuomo, and declared ‘‘even in a pan-
demic, the Constitution cannot be put away 
and forgotten’’; and 
Whereas, for millions of people of the 
United States, churches, synagogues, and 
houses of worship are more than just build-
ings, and the ability to gather together in 
prayer for people of all faiths, creeds, and be-
liefs must not be diminished or impeded by 
the whims of government officials: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) affirms its support for the rights, lib-
erties, and protections enshrined in the 
United States Constitution; and 
(2) commits to vigorously defend the right 
of all people of the United States to engage 
in the free exercise of religion.

HUMAN, CIVIL, AND POLITICAL 
RIGHTS AND ENSURE FREE AND 
FAIR 
ELECTIONS 
IN 
JANUARY 
2021, AND RECOGNIZING THE IM-
PORTANCE OF MULTIPARTY DE-
MOCRACY IN UGANDA 
Mr. MENENDEZ submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 807 
Whereas the United States has an impor-
tant interest in supporting democracy in 
Uganda and has consistently demonstrated 
support for the people of Uganda through ef-
forts to advance good governance, economic 
growth, and improved access to health and 
education; 
Whereas Uganda has been an important se-
curity partner of the United States, includ-
ing through its contributions to the counter- 
terrorism efforts in East Africa, and to the 
African Union Mission in Somalia; 
Whereas Uganda remains one of the top 
refugee hosting countries in the world, a 
contribution that plays an important role in 
regional stability and humanitarian protec-
tion; 
Whereas more than 75 percent of Uganda’s 
population is younger than 30 years of age, 
and the political, economic, and social sta-
bility of country will be shaped by the wel-
fare of its youth, and their access to oppor-
tunity, equality, and dignified lives; 
Whereas respect for human, civil, and po-
litical rights and deepening multiparty de-
mocracy are essential to Uganda’s long-term 
economic prosperity and political stability;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7809 
December 18, 2020 
Whereas the conduct of elections, particu-
larly the January 2021 elections, will have a 
significant impact on the trajectory of 
democratic growth in Uganda and its rela-
tionship with the United States; 
Whereas the National Resistance Move-
ment (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘NRM’’) took control of the Government of 
Uganda in 1986 after period of protracted 
conflict and has dominated the political af-
fairs in Uganda ever since; 
Whereas Yoweri Museveni has served as 
Uganda’s head of state since 1986, making 
him the third-longest actively serving head 
of state in Africa; 
Whereas Uganda has had national elections 
since 1996, and multiparty elections since 
2006, all of which have been won by the NRM 
and President Museveni; 
Whereas the NRM has engineered changes 
to the Ugandan constitution in 2005 and 2017, 
which removed presidential term limits and 
age-limits respectively, and have allowed 
President Museveni to remain in power for 
more than 3 decades; 
Whereas national elections in Uganda 
since 1996 have not met internationally ac-
cepted standards for free and fair polls, as 
the ruling party has leveraged access to, and 
influence over, state resources and institu-
tions to tilt the electoral balance in its 
favor; 
Whereas Ugandan authorities have used co-
ercive measures, including arbitrary arrests 
and 
detentions, 
torture, 
extra-judicial 
killings, and intrusive surveillance tech-
nology to intimidate and silence political op-
position in the country; 
Whereas in March 2020, the Constitutional 
Court of Uganda annulled section 8 of the re-
pressive Public Order Management Act of 
2013, but Ugandan authorities continue to 
obstruct lawful assemblies by the political 
opposition, often through violence; 
Whereas the Museveni Administration has 
used arbitrary and partisan legal action, en-
abled by its control of the courts, to intimi-
date and silence members of the political op-
position; 
Whereas Ugandan authorities have not 
been held accountable for human rights 
abuses, including those perpetrated against 
prominent members of the political opposi-
tion, including members of parliament; 
Whereas many Ugandan officials have not 
been held accountable for acts of gross cor-
ruption, which have been documented by 
Human Rights Watch in 2013 and other non-
governmental organizations (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘NGOs’’), despite the exist-
ence of anti-corruption laws, including— 
(1) the Penal Code Act; 
(2) the Leadership Code Act, 2002; 
(3) the Inspectorate of Government Act, 
2002; 
(4) the Anti-Corruption Act, 2009; and 
(5) the Public Finance Management Act, 
2015; 
Whereas Ugandan authorities continue to 
deploy a range of restrictive and onerous ad-
ministrative measures against NGOs, includ-
ing— 
(1) the deregistration of more than 12,000 
mostly local NGOs in November 2019; 
(2) the freezing of the bank accounts of 
some NGOs in December 2020; and 
(3) a broader range of actions designed to 
intimidate civil society, such as the denial of 
entry or deportation of some leaders of inter-
national NGOs in 2020; 
Whereas independent media outlets in 
Uganda have been placed under increasing 
duress by the Museveni Administration 
through regulatory and other administrative 
and legal actions designed to intimidate 
journalists who report independently; 
Whereas journalists working for foreign 
media outlets are now required to re-register 
with Ugandan authorities or risk criminal 
penalties and some foreign journalists have 
been deported from the country; 
Whereas Ugandan authorities have sought 
to undermine digital rights, including by— 
(1) subjecting people with large social 
media followings to onerous administrative 
regulation through the Uganda Communica-
tions Commission public notice of September 
2020 and prior regulatory acts of the Uganda 
Communications Commission; 
(2) imposing burdensome taxes on social 
media users; 
(3) blocking access to social media during 
the 2016 elections; and 
(4) prosecuting some individuals who have 
criticized the Museveni Administration on 
social media platforms; 
Whereas although Uganda is home to one 
of the premiere institutions of higher edu-
cation in Africa (Makerere University), 
Ugandan authorities have taken repeated ac-
tion to suppress academic freedom and in-
timidate students and faculty that have been 
critical of the Museveni Administration, in-
cluding by firing and jailing professors who 
criticize the regime; 
Whereas same-sex relations in Uganda re-
main criminalized under section 145 of the 
Penal Code Act, and people who identify as 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘LGBTQ per-
sons’’) face a range of direct punitive action 
from Ugandan authorities, such as arrest and 
detention, and a permissive environment 
that 
encourages 
impunity 
for 
attacks 
against LGBTQ persons; 
Whereas the Museveni Administration has 
deployed an escalating array of repressive 
measures before the January 2021 elections, 
including placing uneven and partisan limits 
on the campaign activity of leading opposi-
tion candidates and arresting some can-
didates, which have triggered protests and 
the subsequent use of force by the security 
apparatus to put down the protests, which 
led to the deaths of at least 28 people in No-
vember 2020: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the Museveni Administra-
tion’s assault on democratic freedoms, in-
cluding attacks on opposition politicians, as-
saults on journalists and media freedoms, 
and burdensome restrictions on nongovern-
mental organizations; 
(2) urges the Government of Uganda— 
(A) to respect the rights enshrined in the 
Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (re-
ferred to in this resolution as the ‘‘Constitu-
tion’’) and relevant international obliga-
tions, particularly the rights to freedom of 
movement, expression, information, religion, 
association, equality, privacy, and personal 
security; and 
(B) to take immediate steps to improve the 
pre-election environment and to create con-
ditions for credible democratic elections in 
January 2021 that enable Ugandan citizens 
the opportunity to freely exercise their right 
to vote; 
(3) calls upon the Government of Uganda 
and President Museveni— 
(A) to repeal repressive laws and adminis-
trative actions that are contrary to the prin-
ciples of good governance, a healthy democ-
racy, and the rights enumerated in the Con-
stitution, such as— 
(i) 
colonial-era 
laws 
that 
target 
the 
LGBTQ community; and 
(ii) the Uganda Communications Commis-
sion’s September 2020 public notice that, in 
conjunction with other regulations, under-
mines digital rights; 
(B) to allow citizens, civil society organi-
zations, and political parties to assemble 
peacefully and to freely express their views; 
(C) to immediately lift uneven and par-
tisan restrictions on political activities, in-
cluding the uneven, partisan, and violent ap-
plication of COVID–19 restrictions on opposi-
tion political gatherings and rallies, and to 
safely allow opposition parties to hold polit-
ical rallies, meetings, and demonstrations at 
times of their choosing; 
(D) to provide transparent, consistent, and 
nonintrusive 
procedures 
for 
nongovern-
mental organizations to register, and to en-
able them to carry out programs and other 
legal activity without interference from the 
state authorities; 
(E) to safeguard press and academic free-
dom, in accordance with the Constitution 
and the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, adopted in Paris December 10, 1948; 
(F) 
to 
condemn 
threats 
and 
attacks 
against opposition political parties and civil 
society, and to ensure accountability for 
harassment, intimidation, or physical at-
tacks on members of the opposition; 
(G) to end the escalating campaign of re-
pression against opposition candidates and 
their parties before the January 2021 elec-
tions; and 
(H) to guarantee the ability of domestic 
and international election observers to mon-
itor the January 2021 polls without hin-
drance; 
(4) calls on the Secretary of State, and the 
heads of relevant departments and agencies 
of the United States Government to con-
tinue— 
(A) to speak out against the Government 
of Uganda’s efforts to undermine democracy; 
and 
(B) to hold the Government of Uganda ac-
countable for respecting the rights of its 
citizens, in accordance with its Constitution 
and international obligations, including by— 
(i) considering the imposition of targeted 
sanctions and visa restrictions on actors in-
volved in undermining credible, transparent 
elections, or for perpetrating or abetting 
human rights abuses; 
(ii) leading international partners and in-
stitutions, including those in Africa, in de-
veloping and implementing strategies and 
actions to promote and defend human, civil, 
and political rights and multiparty democ-
racy in Uganda; 
(iii) immediately conducting a review of 
United States Government assistance and 
cooperation with the Government of Uganda 
for the purposes of reprioritizing areas and 
sectors of assistance should neutral observ-
ers determine that the January 2021 polls do 
not meet internationally accepted standards 
for credible elections; and 
(iv) insisting on full and public investiga-
tions that ensure accountability for acts of 
violence, harassment and intimidation per-
petrated against political opposition, jour-
nalists, and members of civil society, espe-
cially before and after the January 2021 elec-
tions.

MAKING 
FURTHER 
CONTINUING 
APPROPRIATIONS 
FOR 
FISCAL 
YEAR 2021 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.J. Res. 107. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the joint resolu-
tion by title for the information of the 
Senate. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 107) making 
further continuing appropriations for fiscal 
year 2021, and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to proceeding to the meas-
ure? 
Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, last 
week I indicated that it would be unac-
ceptable for the Senate to recess for 
the Christmas holidays without pro-
viding substantial direct payments to 
the working families of our country 
and to their children. 
Majority Leader MCCONNELL and I do 
not agree on much, but as I understand 
it, we are in agreement on at least one 
point, and that is that the Senate can-
not go home until the COVID emer-
gency relief bill is passed. The fact that 
the majority leader intends to keep the 
Senate in session this weekend to con-
tinue work on the COVID relief pack-
age is the correct decision. 
But let me, at this time, be as clear 
as I can be. Senator JOSH HAWLEY, a 
Republican from Missouri, and I have 
been working together to make certain 
that the working families of this coun-
try have a direct payment of $1,200 for 
adults and $2,400 for couples and $500 
for each of their children. Let me also 
be absolutely clear that I will object to 
any attempt by the Senate to pass an 
omnibus appropriations bill and leave 
town before passing a COVID relief bill 
with substantial direct payments going 
to working people. 
The truth is that the working fami-
lies of this country today are probably 
in a worse economic condition than at 
any time since the Great Depression. 
Millions of people are unable to pay 
their rent, and they are worried about 
being evicted. Hunger is, literally, at 
the highest level that it has been in 
several decades. And in the midst of 
this terrible, terrible pandemic, we 
have tens of millions of people who 
cannot afford to go to a doctor. That is 
unacceptable. 
I would say to my colleagues, let’s 
get this package passed. Let’s make 
certain that we have direct payments 
to working families of this country, 
and with that I would withdraw my ob-
jection. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the joint resolu-
tion. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The joint resolution was ordered to a 
third reading and was read the third 
time. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I know of no fur-
ther debate on the joint resolution. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate on the joint resolu-
tion, the joint resolution having been 
read the third time, the question is, 
Shall the joint resolution pass? 
The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 107) 
was passed. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

pilation of materials from the CON-

HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER 
JASON SHUPING 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of a hero—Concord Police 
Department Officer Jason Shuping. 
On the night of December 16, 2020, Officer 
Shuping was among the first law enforcement 
officers on the scene to respond to an at-
tempted carjacking. 
The suspect opened fire, striking Officer 
Shuping and another first responder—Officer 
Kaleb Robinson. 
Though wounded, Officer Robinson, aged 
23-years-old, stood guard over his fellow offi-
cer as other officers arrived on the scene and 
engaged the gunman. Robinson was rushed 
to the hospital and is expected to make a full 
recovery. 
Tragically, Officer Shuping lost his life, suc-
cumbing to the gunshot wound he sustained. 
Officer Shuping was just 25-years-old and 
had been with the Concord Police Department 
for 18 months. 
Prior to joining the department, Officer 
Shuping graduated from UNC Pembroke and 
East Rowan High School. He was an athlete 
in both high school and college, as well as a 
North Carolina scholar graduate. 
Officer Shuping not only leaves behind his 
loving family, but his entire Concord Police 
Department Family led by Chief Gary Gacek— 
an exceptional leader and my friend. 
Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in 
praying for the family of fallen Officer Shuping, 
as well as for healing for Officer Robinson and 
the entire Concord Police Department commu-
nity. 
We will never forget the sacrifice of Officer 
Shuping and all those who put their lives on 
the line every day to keep our communities 
safe, as well as the sacrifice of their families. 
At this time, I ask my colleagues to join me 
to honor the life of Officer Shuping.

HONORING PAT RUTHERFORD AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in honoring Pat Rutherford, an extraordinary 
seamstress and community volunteer, as our 
Iowan of the Week. Since March of this year, 
Pat has dedicated the majority of her time to 
sewing thousands of cloth face masks she 
gives away for free so Iowans can better pro-
tect themselves from COVID–19. This volun-
teer effort has now thoroughly become part of 
her daily life. Her dedication has not only in-
spired others to join in on the mission, but has 
also generated thousands of dollars in dona-
tions to the local food bank at a time when 
families are experiencing greater food insecu-
rity. 
After spotting a woman in the Atlanta airport 
holding a tissue to her face because she didn’t 
have a proper mask, Pat decided no one 
should have to resort to such measures during 
a global pandemic. She returned home and 
stayed busy during her precautionary quar-
antine by sewing high-quality fabric face 
masks people could wash and reuse. Pat put 
up a public Facebook page where community 
members could place orders for the free 
masks, and hundreds of requests came in the 
first day. It’s been nine months since then, 
and the orders haven’t slowed. 
For months at the beginning of her effort, 
Pat was purchasing all the necessary mask 
supplies and sewing equipment from her own 
funds and was doing her best to keep up with 
orders as a solo volunteer. She’d spend hours 
sewing in the basement each day and place 
completed masks on her front porch, publicly 
urging those without a good face covering to 
come to her home and take what they need-
ed. It was an expensive and time-consuming 
endeavor, but Pat was determined to keep 
going. Demand kept up and her efforts caught 
the attention of many, including Verlaine Faber 
and Pam West, who now spend several days 
each week in Pat’s basement helping sew and 
keep up with new mask orders. 
As more people learned about Pat’s project, 
neighbors began donating supplies to help 
out. People would scour garage sales and de-
liver boxes of fabric to Pat’s home. Several 
others volunteered to help Pat, Verlaine, and 
Pam finish masks by stitching on the elastic 
ear loops and sewing pleats. And people 
began to leave monetary donations when 
they’d pick up their mask orders. Rather than 
accept the donations herself, Pat began do-
nating the money to the Grimes Storehouse, 
the local food bank. The effort has generated 
somewhere between $7,000 and $10,000 in 
donations for the Storehouse, including $900 
in Fareway grocery gift cards Pat just dropped 
off to be included in Christmas baskets for 
families in need. 
Pat estimates she and her small band of fel-
low volunteers have sewn and donated more 
than 5,000 masks since March. They’ve filled 
free orders and made donations to local nurs-
ing homes, health care facilities, teachers, a 
reservation in South Dakota, and beyond. 
They linked up with MaskHelpers.org, a 
website used to connect individuals who need 
masks with those who make masks, in order 
to expand their reach. They might be taking a 
short break for the holidays, but they plan to 
get right back at it at the start of 2021. 
Pat is very humble about her efforts this 
year. She’s lost track of exactly how many 
masks she and her friends have made and of 
the exact dollar amount she’s been able to do-
nate to the Grimes food pantry. Those num-
bers aren’t her focus, nor are the accolades 
she so rightly deserves for the huge impact 
she’s made the last several months. All she 
wants to do is help whoever she can however 
she can during this heightened time of need. 
She’s very grateful for all the new people 
she’s been able to connect with through the 
project. This story is a beautiful example of 
the leadership, altruism, and community spirit 
Iowans possess. I can’t thank Pat Rutherford 
enough for all she’s done to help the commu-
nity of Grimes, and I couldn’t be happier to 
name her as Iowan of the Week.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
BISHOP RANCE LEE ALLEN 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life of Bishop Rance Lee 
Allen. Bishop Allen passed unexpectedly from 
this life on October 31, 2020 leaving a wide-
spread legacy. 
Rance Lee Allen was born in Monroe, Michi-
gan on November 19, 1948, the middle broth-
er between Tom and Steve. His was born one 
of twelve children to Thomas and Emma 
Pearl. At an early age, he showed a passion 
for both music and preaching. By age nine he 
was travelling as a preacher in Michigan, Ohio 
and Indiana. After graduating from Monroe 
High School, he attended Monroe County 
Community College. On December 1, 1970, 
Rance Allen married Ellen Marie Groves. 
In 1978, Rance Allen was ordained as an 
Elder of the Church of God in Christ, taking on 
a position as associate pastor at Monroe’s Ho-
liness Temple. In 1985 Toledo’s New Bethel 
Church was founded and Bishop Allen was 
appointed its pastor, a position he held until 
his death. 
In 1995, Bishop Allen received an Honorary 
Doctorate of Divinity from Urban Bible Institute 
of Detroit, Michigan. In 2011, Bishop Allen 
was consecrated as Jurisdictional Prelate of 
the Michigan Northwest Harvest Ecclesiastical 
Jurisdiction by the Church of God in Christ. In 
2020, Bishop Allen earned a Doctorate of The-
ology Degree from Kingdom University Inter-
national of Orlando, Florida. 
An anointed gospel singer and musician, he 
founded the Rance Allen Group in 1967 with 
his brothers Tom and Steve, with Rance as 
the featured singer and also playing guitar and 
keyboard. Together for over 50 years, only the 
coronavirus pandemic temporarily stopped the 
group’s performances. The Rance Allen Group 
released 21 albums, won six Stellar Awards, 3 
Grammy Nominations, and have several other 
awards to the group’s credit. 
Well known in the music world, Rance Allen 
also performed with other music artists includ-
ing CeCe Winans, Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg 
and Aretha Franklin. In 2015, Bishop Allen re-
ceived the highest honor of his musical career 
by being invited and performing at the White 
House in a tribute to the gospel music tradition

hosted by President Barack and First Lady 
Michelle Obama. 
In 1998, The Rance Allen Group was in-
ducted into the International Gospel Music Hall 
of Fame and Museum. In 2005, Rance Allen 
was awarded BMI’s Trailblazer of Gospel 
Music Award. In 2009 the Black Academy of 
Arts and Letters named him as one of the 
Great Men of Gospel. 
Bishop Allen wove his ministry and his 
music into a tapestry which shone for the glory 
of God. His was a life well lived, and when he 
completed his time on earth at age 71, his 
Lord called him home with the words in Mat-
thew 25:21, ‘‘Well done, thou good and faithful 
servant: thou hast been faithful over a few 
things, I will make thee ruler over many things: 
enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.’’ 
To Bishop Allen’s wife Ellen, his brothers 
Thomas and Steve, his congregants and 
countless friends, we hope the memory of this 
great man brings comfort as his joyous life is 
celebrated.

KAZAKHSTAN INDEPENDENCE DAY 
HON. STEVE CHABOT 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, as a co- 
chair of the U.S. Kazakhstan Caucus, I rise 
today 
to 
acknowledge 
Republic 
of 
Kazakhstan’s Independence Day, which they 
celebrated on December 16. It’s hard to be-
lieve that next year will mark the 30th anniver-
sary of Kazakhstan’s independence. While 
Kazakhstan still has considerable work to do, 
especially with respect to human rights and 
the rule of law, I applaud Kazakhstan for its 
commitment to democracy and for continuing 
to take the necessary steps toward a more 
democratic and free society for all. 
Democracy requires constant work and vigi-
lance, and in Kazakhstan, President, Kassym- 
Jomart Tokayev, who assumed office in 2019, 
has continued to focus on internal reforms 
which initially began under former President 
Nazarbayev. These reforms have focused on 
a variety of different areas including increasing 
the openness of government and the govern-
ment’s responsiveness to the concerns of ordi-
nary Kazakh citizens. In that vein, Kazakhstan 
will hold parliamentary elections on January 
10, after recently made parliamentary reforms, 
such as ensuring certain minority party rights 
within parliament. 
As Kazakhstan prepares to turn thirty years 
old, it is important to reaffirm the United 
States’ commitment to Kazakhstan and to the 
bilateral 
relationship 
between 
the 
United 
States and Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan remains 
an important ally and partner in Central Asia 
and U.S. companies continue to be the largest 
source of direct foreign investment there. 
Kazakhstan, a strong partner in Afghanistan, 
entered into an Enhanced Strategic Partner-
ship for the 21st Century with the United 
States 
in 
2018, 
where 
the 
U.S. 
and 
Kazakhstan agreed to heightened cooperation 
on political and security issues, Afghanistan 
and other defense initiatives, terrorism, extre-
mism, rule of law, and human rights. 
Additionally, as the COVID–19 pandemic 
has caused a global public health and eco-
nomic crisis this year, Kazakhstan has been a 
leader and valuable partner with the United 
States. President Tokayev, has shown leader-
ship in global health while working directly with 
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which 
maintains 
a 
Central 
Asian 
office 
in 
Kazakhstan. 
Madam Speaker, I applaud Kazakhstan’s 
leadership, its progress, and its commitments 
to further political reforms that will secure its 
leadership role in the international community. 
I am watching with interest as Kazakhstan 
continues to strive to meet its international 
commitments to freedom, human rights, de-
mocracy, and the rule of law. I look forward to 
continuing to support Kazakhstan in its em-
brace of democratic standards. I wish the peo-
ple of Kazakhstan a happy Independence Day 
and look forward to celebrating the Republic’s 
30th anniversary next year.

DEPENDABLE EMPLOYMENT AND 
LIVING 
IMPROVEMENTS 
FOR 
VETERANS ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary Committee and 
the 
Homeland 
Security 
Committee, 
and 
daughter-in-law of a beloved member of the 
Tuskegee Airmen who served our nation so 
heroically in World War II, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Senate Amendment to H.R. 7105, 
the ‘‘Johnny D. Isakson and David P. Roe Vet-
erans Health Care and Benefits Improvement 
Act of 2020,’’ which keeps faith with what 
President Lincoln called our solemn obligation 
‘‘to provide for them who have borne the bat-
tle, and their widow and their orphan.’’ 
I support this bipartisan omnibus legislation 
because it provides support for women vet-
erans, expands benefits for homeless vet-
erans, and ensures servicemembers and vet-
erans impacted by the COVID–19 pandemic 
will be cared for properly and compas-
sionately. 
Let me highlight some of the important ele-
ments of this most important legislation. 
Title V of the bill incorporates H.R. 7105, 
the Deborah Sampson Act, which the House 
passed on November 12, 2019, to address in-
equities and barriers that women veterans 
face when accessing VA care and benefits. 
Deborah Sampson Gannett was a Revolu-
tionary War veteran who served in the Conti-
nental Army from 1781 to 1783 and was 
awarded a full military pension for her military 
service after years of petitioning Congress. 
Specifically the legislation creates a dedi-
cated Office of Women’s Health at VA, ex-
pands reintegration and readjustment group 
counseling retreats for women veterans and 
their family members, and bolsters call center 
services for women veterans. 
The bill eliminates barriers to care by staff-
ing every VA health facility with a dedicated 
women’s health primary care provider, training 
clinicians, and retrofitting VA facilities to en-
hance privacy and improve the environment of 
care for women veterans. 
In addition, the legislation bolsters sup-
portive services by providing access to legal 
services for women veterans, expanding child 
care for veterans receiving VA health care, 
and requiring the Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) to report on VA’s efforts to sup-
port homeless or at-risk women veterans. 
And importantly, the bill improves access to 
care and benefits for survivors of military sex-
ual trauma (MST) by expanding MST coun-
seling to former Guard and Reserve members, 
allowing VA to treat the physical health condi-
tions of MST, and improving the claims proc-
ess for MST survivors at the Veterans Benefits 
Administration. 
Also included in the omnibus package be-
fore are several important provisions that I 
strongly support, including provisions directing 
VA to continue providing the disability benefits 
questionnaires online, streamlining veterans’ 
access to earned disability benefits. 
The bill lowers the age at which a surviving 
spouse may still receive dependency indem-
nity compensation benefits at the point of re-
marriage and increases VA’s funding cap from 
$5 million to $10 million annually to better as-
sist states, territories and tribal governments in 
covering the increasing costs of operating and 
maintaining state-run veteran cemeteries. 
I am very pleased that this eliminates co-
payments for Native American veterans ac-
cessing health care at VA and establishes an 
Advisory Committee on Tribal and Indian Af-
fairs to advise the VA Secretary on matters re-
lating to Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and 
Native American veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation requires VA to 
review the entire scheduling process—for both 
in-house and non-VA care—in order to in-
crease veterans’ access to timely health care 
and to remove barriers to VA funding for orga-
nizations in need of critical upgrades to keep 
homeless veterans safe from the coronavirus. 
Another important provision of the bill is the 
expansion 
of 
the 
Veteran 
Employment 
Through Technology Education Courses for 
Training Providers (VET TEC) program to help 
veterans and servicemembers transition to ci-
vilian life. 
In this time where the COVID–19 pandemic 
has disrupted the lives of so many Americans, 
this legislation ensures that servicemembers 
who contract COVID–19 while serving will be 
eligible for VA benefits and requires VA to 
take a more central and active role by devel-
oping a plan to address the financial exploi-
tation of veterans. 
The legislation requires VA to establish a 
national protocol for administering medical 
exams for volunteer drivers providing transpor-
tation for veterans who are unable to safely 
get to and from their appointments. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation assists 
homeless veterans by improving VA’s ability to 
award grant and per diem program funding to 
qualified providers of homelessness assist-
ance services, expand HUD-VASH vouchers 
to veterans with other than honorable dis-
charges, provide legal services for homeless

veterans, and extend the coordination of case 
management services for homeless veterans. 
Elsewhere in the area of housing, the bill 
expands eligibility for VA Home Loan Guar-
anty Program to more members of the Na-
tional Guard and Reserves, reduces the home 
loan funding fee for veterans impacted by dis-
asters, and extends home loan funding fee 
rates through 2030. 
In a provision especially timely, the bill pro-
vides retraining Assistance for Veterans and 
provides the VA and Labor Secretaries access 
to the Federal directory of new hires to assist 
in veterans employment, expand the VET TEC 
training program for more veterans, extend the 
Off-Base Transition Training program, and di-
rect VA to provide grants to community organi-

Finally, the bill expands federal aid to coun-
ties for veterans’ cemeteries; increases funds 
for State, county, and tribal veterans’ ceme-
teries operating and maintenance expenses; 
and 
provides

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support these bipar-

honor and provide for our veterans, who an-
swered the call of their nation and were willing 
to risk and give all so that we can remain free.

HONORING 
MRS. 
IDALIA 
DOMI´NGUEZ DE MARTY FOR 40 
YEARS OF SERVICE AS A CON-
GRESSIONAL STAFFER 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto Rico. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
longest-serving Puerto Rican Congressional 
staffer, Mrs. Idalia Domı´nguez de Marty, whom 
everybody knows her by her nickname 
‘‘Pichy’’, for forty years of dedicated service. 
Pichy was born and raised in Guayama, 
Puerto Rico, with family, faith, and education 
at the center of her upbringing. A committed 
public servant, her career with the U.S. House 
of Representatives began in 1980 under the 
tenure of Congressman Robert Garcı´a, and in 
1990, Congressman Jose´ E. Serrano retained 
her on his staff, where she has proven to be 
one of the most reliable and trusted staffers 
on both New York and Puerto Rico issues. 
Throughout her service in Congress, Pichy 
has played a key role in mentoring younger 
generations who are committed to public serv-
ice. As an example of that vision, she was in-
strumental in the implementation of the 
Co´rdova & Ferno´s Congressional Internship 
Program—an educational program created in 
1993 by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto 
Rico to provide outstanding college students 
on the Island the opportunity to spend a se-
mester in Washington, D.C. and enjoy the ex-
periences that before were available only to 
students at mainland institutions. 
In her role as Chief Administrator, she has 
never sought credit for herself and has always 
sought to empower other staff members to 
succeed and serve the American people, with 
humility and conviction. In addition to her out-
standing interpersonal skills, she has handled 
all or her duties with responsibility, determina-
tion, and leadership. 
Besides her commitment to constituent serv-
ice, Pichy has been a leader in Puerto Rico 
policy issues in Congress and has long advo-
cated for statehood and full equality for our 
beloved Island. For forty years, Pichy has 
been on the right side of history, always pro-
viding good counsel with both frankness and 
discretion to statehood leaders. For this, I am 
truly grateful 
A devout Catholic, Pichy practices her faith 
living it by example every day, helping the 
most vulnerable and disadvantaged members 
of our society. 
In short, Pichy is faith-filled, compassionate, 
loyal, and an effective manager, and all who 
have known and worked with her feel privi-
leged for it. Madam Speaker, I take this oppor-
tunity to express my gratitude to Mrs. Idalia 
Domı´nguez de Marty, our dear ‘‘Pichy’’, for 
forty years of exceptional public service.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF CARL WILKERSON 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Carl Wilkerson, 
a dear friend and inspiration to many through-
out North Carolina’s Eighth Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Mr. Wilkerson was born on March 7, 1935 
to the late Willie Wilkerson and Anna Irene 
White Wilkerson. A native of Rowan County, 
he served over 32 years as the custodian at 
China Grove Elementary School. 
Mr. Wilkerson made a profound difference in 
this community. We often highlight educators 
and their influence on the lives of children. 
Carl Wilkerson made an impact on the lives of 
all the children educated at China Grove Ele-
mentary School. 
Former students and educators alike re-
member that Carl always had a kind word for 
everyone, encouraged students and made 
each one feel special. He is the perfect exam-
ple of a person who quietly but surely makes 
a community great. 
Mr. Wilkerson passed away on November 
22, 2020 and left behind a legacy of kindness 
and compassion. My thoughts and prayers are 
with his family and all who knew and loved 
him. Mr. Wilkerson will live on in the hearts 
and minds of all who felt his kindness and I 
join the entire community in honoring his quiet, 
but extraordinary life. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring the life and legacy of Carl Wilkerson.

IN HONOR OF CAPTAIN JAMIE D. 
CLARK 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Captain Jamie D. 
Clark of the Pennsylvania State Police on her 
upcoming retirement on January 8, 2021. Cap-
tain Clark is currently the only female troop 
commander in the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania. 
Captain Clark joined the Pennsylvania State 
Police in 1991. After graduating from the 
Academy, she was assigned to Troop A in 
Greensburg, Pennsylvania. She has also 
served on Troop D in Butler, Pennsylvania 
and is currently the Commanding Officer of 
Troop G in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. She 
also has served on the Bureau of Criminal In-
vestigation, the Bureau of Gaming Enforce-
ment, and the Bureau of Training and Edu-
cation. 
Captain Clark had served as a corporal, a 
sergeant, and a lieutenant before being pro-
moted to a captain in April of 2019. Addition-
ally, she graduated from the 392 Northwestern 
School of Police Staff and Command. 
Captain Clark’s outstanding career in law 
enforcement 
across 
southwestern 
and 
southcentral Pennsylvania is a true legacy of 
service. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th 
Congressional District, I congratulate Captain 
Clark on her retirement and wish her every 
continued happiness in the chapters to come.

TRIBUTE

Friday, December 18, 2020 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and achievements 
of Former Denver City Councilwoman Cathy 
Reynolds who passed away on Tuesday, No-
vember 24, 2020 at the age of 75. 
Cathy was a leader, fighter and history 
maker from Colorado. She was a trailblazer- 
Denver City Council’s first elected Council-
woman and also its longest serving member. 
Originally from Kansas City, Missouri, Cathy 
moved to Denver in the mid–1960’s when her

husband Rick accepted a position with Denver 
Public Schools. Cathy had a strong desire to 
give back to her new city, and she landed on 
the Denver City Council in 1975. 
During her 28 years serving on City Council, 
Cathy proved to be an effective and hard-
working elected official. Evidence of her 
achievements can be found throughout the re-
gion-from our world-renowned airport to our 
popular football stadium and convention cen-
ter. 
But Cathy’s most important legacy was her 
unwavering and fearless commitment to social 
justice. When she moved lo ban assault weap-
ons in Denver, she faced numerous insults 
and even threats against her own life with the 
kind of grace and resolve that earned the re-
spect of some of her fiercest opponents. And 
with similar fortitude, Cathy led the fight on 
changing local zoning ordinances so that 
LGBTQ individuals and those who are dif-
ferently-abled could no longer be excluded 
from living in certain neighborhoods. Truly, 
Cathy Reynolds was a force to be reckoned 
with, as those with whom she served would 
quickly tell you; however, she was also fair, 
and funny, and kind to everyone she met. 
Not surprisingly, Cathy’s unique personal 
traits and organizing ability led her to fill key 
leadership roles, including the role of council 
president, a position in which she served five 
times. Additionally, beyond the City Council, 
Cathy’s leadership qualities and passion for 
social progress resulted in her serving two 
terms as president of the Colorado Municipal 
League and chair of the National League of 
Cities. 
As a political activist and then a young state 
legislator in the 1990’s, I admired Cathy’s 
style—tough but accessible—and her unwav-
ering commitment to civil rights for all. Cathy 
was a model for me as I fought at the state 
level for many of the issues she had success-
fully championed in Denver. 
Put simply, Cathy Reynolds was a trail-
blazing and tireless advocate on behalf of the 
community she loved; and her longtime public 
service was an inspiration to young leaders re-
gardless of their gender. Though Cathy’s leg-
acy will remain alive for many decades to 
come, her powerful presence will be deeply 
missed. 
My heart goes out to her husband Rick Rey-
nolds, as well as to their two children and four 
grandchildren. I hope they find comfort in the 
knowledge that their dear loved one was not 
only a treasure and inspiration to them, but 
also to the countless Denverites whose lives 
she touched.

HONORING THE LIFE OF OSCAR 
BUNCH 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the life of Oscar Bunch. A Vir-
ginian, strong and humble working man of un-
common grace, Mr. Bunch passed from this 
life at age 90 on Friday, December 11, 2020 
surrounded by his family in his home. 
Delivered by a midwife, Oscar Bunch was 
born to Myrtle and Edward Bunch on March 
12, 1930 in Portsmouth, Virginia. Born in the 
depths of the Great Depression, Oscar knew 
hard times and hard work early on. As a child 
he was already working long ten-hour days 
alongside his family as sharecroppers picking 
cotton, peanuts and corn and earning less 
than one dollar a day. This experience, along 
with values earned from a devoutly Christian 
mother who believed in unconditional love and 
hard work, taught him that all people have 
value and worth, that hard working people de-
serve to live decently, and that compassion 
matters. 
When he was thirteen years old, Oscar went 
to work in the Norfolk Navy Yard when World 
War II created a shortage of workers. At age 
fifteen, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and saw 
tours of Germany, France and Belgium during 
the war. After the war ended and Oscar re-
turned home to Virginia, the GI Bill gave him 
the opportunity to go the school. He earned 
his Journeyman’s card as a pipefitter, finishing 
his apprenticeship in 1952. Along the way 
Oscar met and married his wife Ruby, and to-
gether they raised their children Michael, 
Brian, Wesley and Donna. 
The young family moved to Toledo, Ohio, 
and in 1956 Oscar began his career at the 
Chevrolet Transmission plant on Alexis Road 
where he promptly became involved in the 
UAW. In 1972 he was elected as the Skilled 
Trades Bargaining Representative of UAW 
Local 14. He was elected the Local 14 Presi-
dent in 1978 and was re-elected to ten con-
secutive terms. To date, Oscar Bunch is the 
longest serving union local President in UAW 
history. An outstanding negotiator as labor 
leader, Oscar always looked out for the rank- 
and-file, ensuring their voice was heard and 
their needs met. Among his lasting legacies is 
Oscar Bunch park, a lovely greenspace be-
tween the plant and the union hall he worked 
to establish and dedicated in his name upon 
his 2006 retirement, where the families of GM 
workers could gather. 
Oscar spent his career as a labor leader 
putting into practice the lessons he learned in 
his youth. Humble and unassuming, nonethe-
less his words and actions carried great 
weight. He was well respected by labor, man-
agement and community. After retirement, 
Oscar dedicated his efforts to growing the To-
ledo Public Schools’ Toledo Technology Acad-
emy to educate students in the skilled premier 
institution it has become. He remained an ac-
tive participant in many community ventures. 
Throughout his life both in public and pri-
vate, Oscar Bunch sought to ensure a better 
life for the common man. He never forgot 
where he came from and carried with him his 
modest roots. He instilled those values in his 
own family. We wish for his wife, Ruby, his 
son and daughter Wes and Donna, his chil-
dren, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, 
his many friends, that they find some comfort 
in the memories they share and the gift of 
Oscar Bunch’s life to them all, and for our en-
tire community. 
TRANSPARENCY AND EFFECTIVE 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
MEASURES 
FOR VETERAN CAREGIVERS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 16, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary Committee and 
the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in 
strong support of S. 2216, the ‘‘Transparency 
and Effective Accountability Measures for Vet-
eran Caregivers Act,’’ (Team Act), which 
strengthens transparency and communication 
for veterans and caregivers participating in the 
program. 
Mr. Speaker, it is fitting and proper that the 
VA provides stipends and support to care-
givers for wounded veterans. 
To be eligible for this program, veterans 
must have sustained or aggravated a serious 
injury in the line of duty on or after September 
11, 2001 and need personal care services for 
supervision and protection to help them with 
daily living activities. 
Caregivers can include family members or 
other members of the veteran’s support group 
that regularly help veterans recovering from in-
juries. 
Unfortunately, according to reports, care-
givers and veterans have been arbitrarily dis-
charged or downgraded from the program, 
with benefits subsequently revoked or re-
duced—often with little explanation or time to 
appeal the decision. 
In fact, the VA Office of the Inspector Gen-
eral reported in 2018 that VA failed to ade-
quately manage the caregiver program and 
recommended improvements and reforms. 
The TEAM Veteran Caregivers Act takes a 
number of steps to improve the program. 
First, the legislation ensures that all care-
givers are included in the veterans’ medical 
records. 
Currently, only certain caregivers partici-
pating in the Caregiver Support Program are 
included in veterans’ medical records. 
Including all caregivers in medical records 
strengthens communications between VA and 
caregivers and recognizes them as part of the 
clinical team. 
Second, the legislation requires a minimum 
standard of information in downgrade notifica-
tion letters in that it requires VA to provide an 
explanation of downgrade or termination deci-
sions. 
Caregivers have reported that their decision 
letters are sometimes missing important infor-
mation that would be necessary to file an ap-
peal. 
Finally, the legislation extends benefits after 
certain veterans are deemed ineligible for the 
program. 
Caregivers have reported being dropped 
shortly after receiving a termination letter with-
out adequate time to appeal or make new ac-
commodations. 
This codifies a goal of maintaining care for 
an extended period of 150 days in certain 
cases where a veteran is terminated from the 
program. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is strongly en-
dorsed by Disabled American Veterans (DAV), 
a charitable organization with the singular 
focus and mission of empowering veterans to 
lead high-quality lives with respect and dignity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1183 
December 18, 2020 
In supporting the TEAM Veterans Care-
givers Act, DAV states: 
‘‘Family caregivers are the unsung heroes 
for thousands of severely injured veterans, as 
they not only perform complex medical and 
personal care tasks but are often the lifeline 
of many ill and injured veterans to lead dig-
nified and independent lives. However, mis-
management of the VA’s Program of Com-
prehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers 
has, in far too many instances, caused the 
improper disruption or termination of bene-
fits family caregivers need to support their 
veteran.’’ 
I support this bipartisan legislation because 
it provides needed support for veterans who 
can least afford to be without it, those disabled 
in connection with their service to our country. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting to 
pass S. 2216, the TEAM Veteran Caregivers 
Act.

DON FOWLER 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the wonderful life of Don 
Fowler. 
Don Fowler fervently worked at improving 
and molding the South Carolina Democratic 
party to be inclusive, inspiring, and of strong 
moral ground. He served as chairman of the 
S.C. Democratic Party and Democratic Na-
tional Party. Fowler served 30 years in the 
United States Army, was a member of the 
Washington Street United Methodist Church, 
and was a lifetime member of the NAACP. 
Fowler loved politics and he loved people. 
His years of educating spanned over five dec-
ades and his teachings will be passed down 
by his beloved students for many decades to 
come. 
For none of us lives for ourselves alone, 
and none of us dies for ourselves alone. If we 
live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die 
for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we 
belong to the Lord. Romans 7:8. 
Don Fowler lived to serve his loved ones, 
his community, and the party he cherished, 
and he now rests in Heaven. My thoughts and 
prayers are with his family, friends, students, 
and anyone that was lucky enough to know 
the legend of Don Fowler.

TRIBUTE TO CHUCK SASSARA 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to a long-time friend and a great Alas-
kan, Chuck Sassara, who died this Fall at the 
age of 89, just weeks before turning 90, after 
living an incredible life. Chuck was born in De-
troit, Michigan on Oct 19, 1930, and we lost a 
great friend and Alaskan spirit on September 
25, 2020. Chuck was an Aviator, Husband, 
Father, Grandfather, State Legislator, Sailor, 
Advocate, Author, Businessman, Athlete, Sto-
ryteller and, an amazing Character. He is 
known and loved by thousands around the 
globe and died on a Friday afternoon while re-
fueling his Toyota van, preparing to go . . . 
somewhere. 
Chuck loved life. He was always headed to 
the next adventure—whether that was driving 
the Alcan Highway almost 50 times, ferrying 
aircraft across the continent, driving across 
North Africa with his young family at the end 
of the Algerian war, or sailing across the At-
lantic. He believed in the best of human na-
ture and was never cynical about the future. 
He was unafraid to try new things, but he 
didn’t always succeed. Lately, it was his re-
peated failures to master his ‘‘smart phone’’ 
with 89-year-old fingers. 
Born to Charles Sr. (Pappy) and Kathleen 
Agnes (Nana) he, along with brother Richard 
(Dick) Sassara, grew up between Miami, the 
Panama Canal Zone, and Los Angeles. Meet-
ing his true love Ann at University HS in Los 
Angeles, the couple married while Chuck at-
tended UCLA. Upon graduation they had a 
discussion; go back to Panama or see Alas-
ka? In the spring of 1955, they drove north in 
a VW bus to build a life and help bring a new 
state into being. In the early 60’s Chuck ran 
for the State House and quickly became the 
Majority Leader and Finance Chair. In these 
roles he championed such important work as 
the 1964 Equal Rights Amendment, Women’s 
Rights, and the creation of University of Alas-
ka Anchorage. His peers in the Legislature in-
cluded Nick Begich, Willie Hensley, Ted Ste-
vens and me. The group of us were often 
competitors, often allies, and after session 
‘‘happy-hour’’ compatriots, bound together by 
circumstance, a common purpose and shared 
values. We were great friends and had great 
respect for one another, whether we agreed or 
disagreed on the politics of the day. We need 
more of that spirit of bipartisan friendship, not 
less. 
As an aviator Chuck flew commercial, multi 
engine aircraft and was an IFR rated pilot that 
flew 161 different types of aircraft, logging 
over 25,000 hours in planes as small as the 
Breezy to as large as the four engine Lock-
heed Constellation. As a sailor he crossed the 
Atlantic, made passages from Miami to Los 
Angeles, sailed solo from Seattle to Whittier 
Alaska, and made several dozen trips to the 
Bahamas and beyond, finishing with an off-
shore passage from Florida to the Carolina 
Outer Banks with son Charlie, nephew Rick 
and friend Michel Bourquin in 2017. As a writ-
er, his memoir ‘‘Propellers, Politics and Peo-
ple: Chuck Sassara’s Alaska’’ is a testament 
to his skill as a storyteller and the craft of put-
ting others first, in narrative and in life. 
He is survived by his proudest achievement: 
his sons Charlie and Richard, grandchildren 
Tyler, Rachael, and Annalyssa, and his 
daughter-in-law Mary, Mimi Bourquin, his 
nephew Rick and his wife Amy, their daughter 
Katy, niece Lisa and her daughters Alexandria 
and Gabrielle, and his sister-in-law, Ellen. 
Most of all, Chuck will be survived by the 
raucous and wonderful stories he told to 
friends over coffee and beer, the lives he 
saved, and the spirit of Alaska he imbued in 
everything he touched. All of us who knew him 
rest comfortably knowing he’s somewhere on 
a broad reach, steering by starlight, and re-
united with his beloved Ann. We love Chuck, 
sail on and Godspeed. 
A WORD OF THANKS TO GEORGIAN 
PARLIAMENTARIAN 
AND 
OSCE 
PA 
PRESIDENT 
GEORGE 
TSERETELI 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, during this 
challenging year I have periodically taken the 
floor to update my Congressional colleagues 
on my continued work with our friends and al-
lies across the Atlantic as we confront the 
challenges facing Europe and beyond. This 
has included not only the direct impact of the 
COVID pandemic itself on public and eco-
nomic health but also in regard to ongoing 
issues like Russian aggression, the violation of 
human rights in Belarus and other countries, 
and the common threat all countries face from 
terrorism. 
Today, I take the floor to praise one of our 
best friends and allies in these efforts, George 
Tsereteli, who is stepping down as President 
of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly—the 
OSCE PA—as a result of leaving the par-
liament of the Republic of Georgia. During his 
tenure as President, I have significantly deep-
ened my engagement in this valuable forum, 
including 
being 
appointed 
by 
President 
Tsereteli earlier this year to serve as chair of 
the OSCE PA committee dealing with security 
matters. 
George Tsereteli is a true leader. During his 
time as President of the OSCE PA, he has 
spoken out forcefully against the violation of 
the Helsinki Principles which guide relations 
between OSCE countries and emphasized the 
linkages between these principles. That in-
cludes condemning the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine and other neighbors, including his 
own country of Georgia. That also includes 
condemning the violation of human rights that 
is today so brutally evident in Belarus but has 
in fact been an ongoing issue there as well as 
in Russia and far too many other OSCE coun-
tries. True peace, in his view, requires respect 
for human rights. At the same time, George 
worked with parliamentarians from across the 
OSCE region, respecting their more specific 
concerns on a variety of issues, from combat-
ting corruption to environmental protection, 
and giving them a venue to raise these issues 
in this multilateral forum. 
In this sense, George Tsereteli represents 
his country well. He understands that, if the 
international community is to assist Georgia 
with the challenges it faces, Georgians must 
make their contribution to security and co-
operation across Europe, the OSCE region 
and beyond. 
George Tsereteli is also a true friend of the 
United States and of the Congress. He keeps 
in close contact with me and other Members 
from both sides of the aisle. George does the 
same with our colleagues in the Senate. When 
he visits the United States, George never fails 
to reach out. In between, despite his heavy 
schedule, George is always available when we 
need his input. In his speeches, George regu-
larly recognizes the good work done by the 
U.S. Helsinki Commission. 
Finally, George Tsereteli understands that it 
is not only diplomats or parliamentarians who 
contribute to positive change. He has engaged

and supported those individuals who, as oppo-
sition leaders, journalists or human rights ad-
vocates, act upon their own human rights to 
defend the human rights of others, indeed 
those of all citizens. This was evident in his 
support for efforts by many of us to hold ac-
countable those who were truly responsible for 
the murder of Russian opposition figure Boris 
Nemtsov, or his suggestions on how best to 
respond to the assault on the citizenry today 
in Belarus. 
Those of us who have engaged through the 
OSCE PA will miss having George Tsereteli 
leading our debates from the dais, but I am 
sure we will continue to have opportunities to 
work with him in his future endeavors. I am 
also sure that, passing the gavel to Peter Lord 
Bowness of the United Kingdom as OSCE PA 
President, he has left a healthy institution in 
capable hands. As the Assembly undertakes 
this leadership transition, I want to assure my 
colleagues here in Congress and in the OSCE 
PA of my own enduring commitment to ad-
vancing the interests of the United States and 
of its many friends and partners throughout 
the OSCE region. 
On a more personal note, I consider myself 
blessed to call George Tsereteli my friend. He 
has mentored me, encouraged me, and given 
me extraordinary opportunities to be a voice 
for my constituents and our nation on the 
international stage. George’s humor and kind-
ness have enriched my life and the lives of all 
those who have been fortunate enough to 
crossed his path. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
saluting the service of George Tsereteli as the 
longest serving leader in the history of the 
OSCE PA as well as recognizing the impor-
tance of continued Congressional engagement 
with the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE.

IN RECOGNITION OF HON. MARCY 
S. FRIEDMAN 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Jus-
tice Marcy S. Friedman. For the past three 
decades, Justice Friedman has capably pre-
sided over New York City courts. Justice 
Friedman was appointed as a Judge of the 
Housing Part of the Civil Court of New York 
City in 1991 and was elected to the Civil Court 
in 1994. In 2000, Justice Friedman was 
named a Supreme Court Justice by designa-
tion and assigned to the New York County Su-
preme Court, Civil Branch, to which she was 
re-elected in 2004. In 2012, Justice Friedman 
was named as a Justice of the Commercial 
Division, Supreme Court, Civil Branch, New 
York County. For the past few years, Justice 
Friedman has served as the Residential Mort-
gage Backed Securities Judge, working on 
some of the most complex cases in the courts. 
Justice Friedman is a graduate of Smith 
College, magna cum laude, and of the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania School of Law, cum 
laude. She was an associate with Willkie, Farr 
and Gallagher LLP, a staff attorney with the 
Legal Aid Society Civil Division, and a man-
aging attorney at MFY Legal Services. 
Starting in 2000, Justice Friedman presided 
over an Individual Assignment Part in New 
York County, where she handled torts, com-
mercial case, and a wide variety of other 
cases, including employment discrimination, 
insurance, and real estate. Justice Friedman is 
a long-term member of the New York County’s 
Center fore where she has handled mass 
torts, including pharmaceutical and asbestos 
cases. 
Long committed to improving access to jus-
tice, Justice Friedman is a member of the New 
York County Lawyers Association (NYCLA) 
Justice Center and a former member of the 
NYCLA Board of Directors. With the Justice 
Center, Justice Friedman chaired a Task 
Force on Housing Court. She also worked with 
NYCLA and other groups to organize a con-
ference that brough together a distinguished 
group of prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges 
and scholars to address the racial impacts of 
criminal prosecutions of arraignments through 
sentencing. Justice Friedman has also lec-
tured at the New York City Bar Association 
and at judicial seminars on various issues, in-
cluding legal ethics and torts. 
After decades of dedicated service, Justice 
Friedman will be retiring on December 31, 
2020. Her tenure has been highlighted by dili-
gent scholarship and thorough review of com-
plex cases. Justice Friedman’s notable ability 
review and synthesize conflicting decisions 
has been as asset to the New York County 
Court, and she will be missed. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the accomplishments of 
Justice Marcy S. Friedman and expressing ap-
preciation for her contributions to the people of 
New York.

HONORING SENIOR MASTER 
SERGEANT TIMOTHY J. THIELE 
HON. JOHN W. ROSE 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in tribute to a true patri-
otic Tennessean and American, Senior Master 
Sergeant Timothy J. Thiele. Sergeant Thiele 
will retire from the Tennessee Air National 
Guard later this month after 31 years of dedi-
cated service to his state and nation for which 
I offer him my most sincere and heartfelt 
thanks. 
Tennessee has long been known as ‘‘The 
Volunteer State,’’ a nickname that was first 
heard after Tennessee sent a large contingent 
of soldiers to help fight the British during the 
War of 1812. The moniker was solidified and 
forever etched into the history of our state in 
1846 when Tennessee was asked to send 
2,800 soldiers to help fight the Mexican-Amer-
ican War, but over 30,000 Tennesseans vol-
unteered to go. 
Sergeant Thiele’s 31 years of volunteer mili-
tary service is a modem manifestation of that 
proud Tennessee legacy of honor and sac-
rifice during which he deployed overseas elev-
en separate times as a part of Operations 
Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, Inherent 
Resolve, Freedom Sentinel, and New Dawn. 
Closer to home, and as a part of its unique 
dual role, the National Guard is often called 
into action to provide relief and assistance 
during ruinous natural disasters. Sergeant 
Thiele was an important part of such efforts on 
three separate occasions when Hurricanes 
Gustav, Rita, and Katrina devastated regions 
of our country. His valiant efforts and those of 
his fellow Guard members saved lives and 
eased the pain inflicted by the storms’ destruc-
tion on countless fellow Americans. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t properly note 
that the families of our men and women in uni-
form also sacrifice much, especially when their 
loved ones in the military deploy overseas. 
Two-parent families suddenly become one- 
parent families in a practical sense, with the 
obvious burden that ensues. Sergeant Thiele’s 
wife of 20 years, Tyran, along with his children 
Tanner and Addison, sacrificed along with him 
during his deployments, albeit in different 
ways. Military families understand all too well 
the sacrifice represented by missed birthdays, 
holidays, and other special occasions while 
their loved ones are separated from them in 
service to their country. For this I want to ex-
tend my sincere thanks to Sergeant Thiele’s 
family as well for their own dedication and 
service to our nation. 
As Sergeant Thiele rose through the ranks 
during his career, he personally trained hun-
dreds of AeroMed Evacuation personnel in 
Tennessee in addition to leading multistate 
joint medical training efforts. He became 
known as a ‘‘proven leader’’ and a ‘‘superior 
role model’’ by his own superiors, and I 
couldn’t agree more. It is truly an honor to rep-
resent this genuine, modem day patriot in the 
United States Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating Senior Master Ser-
geant Timothy J. Thiele on his retirement, in 
thanking him and his family for their sacrifice 
and service, and in wishing them well in all 
their future endeavors.

MOROVIS NATIONAL CEMETERY 
DEDICATION CEREMONY 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto Rico. 
Madam Speaker, democracies like ours are 
heavily supported by military service under-
taken by their citizens. In the United States, 
soldiers rally under the flag to risk life and limb 
to defend our liberty and the ideals that define 
our country. The responsibility the U.S. Con-
gress assumes to send them to war cannot be 
taken lightly, particularly when their service 
also weighs heavily upon their family and 
community. A weight that is disproportionally 
heavy upon the shoulders of the Puerto 
Ricans who have valiantly and honorably 
stepped forward to serve in harm’s way with-
out enjoying full representation in the U.S. 
Congress. 
Upon separation from the Armed Forces, 
Congress honors the military service of its 
men and women by approving legislation that 
authorizes a wide variety of benefits through 
the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Of 
all these benefits, one that due to its solemn 
nature faithfully demonstrate the eternal grati-
tude of this nation towards its citizen soldiers 
is the interment of their remains in national 
cemeteries. For those citizen soldiers that give 
the ultimate sacrifice while in service and for

those who after returning to civilian life suc-
cumb to sickness or age, the federal govern-
ment has provided an extensive net of na-
tional cemeteries where they are laid to rest 
with honor and allow us to fulfill the solemn 
oath that their service to the nation will never 
be forgotten. 
In fulfillment of that oath, today I have the 
honor to recognize the dedication of the 
Morovis VA National Cemetery, located within 
the boundaries of the Municipality of Morovis 
in my beautiful island of Puerto Rico. Strategi-
cally located in the northern side of the island 
and surrounded by an inspiring and peaceful 
tropical landscape, it will provide the perfect 
setting to honor our fallen soldiers while pro-
viding a protective sanctuary where their fami-
lies and friends can remember their lives and 
mourn their passing. 
In the coming years, as the warm and moist 
earth of Morovis, Puerto Rico slowly embraces 
the remains of the valiant citizen soldiers who 
sailed to the far-flung battlefields of World War 
II, Korea, Vietnam, the Middle East, and many 
other locations; and for those that will follow 
on their steps in the defense of liberty, let’s 
not forget that the quest to achieve full rights 
and equality within the American democracy is 
seeded with their blood, sweat and tears. 
Their sacrifice compels us to continuously 
strive to demolish any barriers that impede the 
enjoyment of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of 
happiness for all the citizens of our great na-
tion.

REINTRODUCTION 
OF 
H.R. 
8768, 
THE ‘‘KEEPING AMERICA’S EN-
ERGY RESOURCES MOVING ACT’’ 
HON. RANDY K. WEBER, SR. 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today, with my fellow Texan, Congress-
woman SYLVIA GARCIA, to bring attention to 
my bill, H.R. 8768, the ‘‘Keeping America’s 
Energy Resources Moving Act,’’ a bill that 
would solve a thorny issue that has arisen in 
the U.S. lightering industry, and which affects 
our nation’s energy independence and our na-
tional security. A bipartisan group of House 
members have worked with the House Judici-
ary Committee, the State Department, and 
Customs and Border Protection to raise 
awareness of this critical problem and to iden-
tify a solution acceptable to the House, execu-
tive agencies, and industry groups. I am grate-
ful for the considerable work put in by my con-
gressional colleagues, the House Judiciary 
Staff, and affected industry groups to craft this 
legislative fix, and I hope that the House will 
act soon to make it law. 
For those who do not know, lightering is the 
use of ‘‘lighter’’ vessel to load and off load 
crude oil and natural gas from very large tank-
er ships whose draft is too deep to access 
U.S. port facilities. Lightering vessels and the 
seafarers who work onboard these vessels are 
key to supporting and maintaining our domes-
tic energy exports and ensuring imports of 
needed crude oil as feedstock for our domes-
tic refiners along the Gulf Coast, in Southern 
California, and in Delaware. That is why the 
industry is vital to the transport of crude oil 
and natural gas both in and out of our domes-
tic ports, the lifeblood of the American energy 
and petrochemical industries. This industry 
quietly forms the connective tissue that has 
enabled American energy to power the world. 
Without the ability to ensure that lightering can 
take place, there could be crude oil shortages 
for U.S. refineries resulting in the lack of pro-
duction of gasoline for our cars, jet fuel for our 
planes, and heating oil to heat U.S. homes in 
the winter. It is just that simple. 
The problem in question stems from the dis-
connect between the visas that seafarers rely 
upon and the necessities of the employment 
contracts of lightering crews. These seafarers 
must transit through a U.S. port of entry and 
remain on board their vessels operating in and 
out of U.S. waters for up to 180 days in order 
to perform their tasks as part of a lightering 
vessel crew, but, under current law, they can 
only remain for 29 days without being granted 
parole by Customs and Border Protection—a 
cumbersome administrative process allowed 
under U.S. law but one we should not have to 
rely upon. A fix is needed to replace this 
band-aid approach. By providing statutory au-
thorization for liquid lightering crewmembers to 
transit the United States for up to 180 days, 
this bill will streamline a cumbersome multi- 
agency process and ensure that the domestic 
energy production and refining capacity that 
underlines our economy and national security 
can continue. For this reason, and this reason 
alone, we introduced legislation to solve this 
problem and provide certainty to this industry, 
and thus to our economy. 
Unfortunately, we are now in the closing 
days of the 116th Congress and have run out 
of time to enact this technical, but necessary, 
legislative fix. Therefore, I plan to reintroduce 
our bipartisan bill, the ‘‘Keeping America’s En-
ergy Resources Moving Act,’’ in the opening 
days of the 117th Congress, and I remain 
committed to solving this problem then.

RECOGNITION OF CHRIS GUINAN 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Chris Guinan, a Philadelphia difference-maker, 
before the United States House of Represent-
atives. Mr. Guinan has become a symbol of 
the can-do neighborly spirit that is the embodi-
ment of The City of Brotherly Love and Sis-
terly Affection. 
Since 2011, Mr. Guinan, aided by his wife, 
Cindy, his son, Christian, his daughter, 
Lauren, and his granddaughter, Sophia, has 
successfully donated 1,000 bikes to children 
throughout Philadelphia who previously lacked 
this essential mode of transportation and free-
dom. 
Mr. Guinan achieved this remarkable feat 
through a combination of years of his own 
hard work—finding and fixing a great many of 
these bikes—and the generous donations of 
others, including his colleagues at SEPTA, 
where he worked for 30 years until his retire-
ment. 
Chris Guinan embodies a commitment to 
the public good. His efforts to make life better 
for Philadelphia’s children are a model for the 
upwelling of selflessness and giving that has 
kept America going through these difficult 
times. He embodies the spirit of Philadel-
phia—and of America. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in extending our sincerest appreciation to 
Chris Guinan for his—and his family’s—ex-
traordinary work on behalf of our community.

IN MEMORY OF MICHAEL CETINA 
HON. SEAN CASTEN 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and mourn the untimely 
passing of Michael Cetina of Wheaton, Illinois. 
Mike passed away unexpectedly on Thanks-
giving Day. 
Mike’s full and productive life touched so 
many and he will be deeply missed. His family 
lost their beloved husband, father, and broth-
er, many lost a great friend, and Wheaton lost 
a pillar of the community. 
As a lawyer, Mike’s work ethic and commit-
ment to upholding the law and advocating for 
the vulnerable was an inspiration. Early in his 
legal career, Mike represented the people of 
DuPage County as an Assistant State’s Attor-
ney, and for the last 30 years he has advo-
cated on behalf of those who were needlessly 
injured or killed through negligence or neglect. 
He was very active in the legal community, 
where he led, mentored, and taught other law-
yers. Throughout his legal career, Mike dem-
onstrated diligent, passionate and ethical pro-
fessionalism. 
Also an outstanding athlete, Mike gave his 
time and effort generously to the community 
through coaching youth sports, including more 
than a decade coaching and helping lead 
Wheaton youth football. Mike leaves a beau-
tiful legacy of hundreds of young athletes who 
learned from his mentorship, colleagues in the 
law who were inspired by his professionalism, 
clients well-served by his advocacy, and an 
entire community who was enriched by his 
friendship. 
Madam Speaker, Mike Cetina was an out-
standing man, and I ask that the House join 
me in expressing our profound gratitude for 
his life and service, and our deepest sympathy 
to his wife of 33 years, Tammy, to their chil-
dren, Danny, Tori, Allie, and Tommy, and to 
the people of Wheaton, for this tremendous 
loss.

IN HONOR OF LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL MAYNARD H. GRAY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Lieutenant Colonel 
Maynard H. Gray of the Pennsylvania State 
Police on his upcoming retirement on January 
8, 2021. 
Lieutenant Colonel Gray joined the Pennsyl-
vania State Police in 1984. After graduating 
from the academy, his first assignment was 
based in Lykens, Pennsylvania. During his ca-
reer, he also has served in Philipsburg, 
McConnellsburg, Philadelphia, Clearfield, Har-
risburg, and Hollidaysburg. In Hollidaysburg, 
he served as the troop commander of Troop 
G. Additionally, he also has served in the Sys-
tems and Process Review Division in the Bu-
reau of Integrity and Professional Standards 
and on the Bureau of Gaming Enforcement. 
He had served as a corporal, a sergeant, a 
lieutenant, a captain, and a major before being 
promoted to a lieutenant colonel and the Dep-
uty Commissioner of Staff in February of 
2020. He also graduated from the 231st Ses-
sion of the FBI National Academy in 2007. 
Lieutenant Colonel Gray and his wife Susan 
have six children, and three of them followed 
in his footsteps to join the Pennsylvania State 
Police. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Con-
gressional District, I thank Lieutenant Colonel 
Gray for his service to our Commonwealth, 
and I wish the Gray family every continued 
success. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
PASQUALE DITERLIZZI 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 18, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life and legacy of Pasquale 
DiTerlizzi. Mr. DiTerlizzi succumbed to the 
coronavirus on December 8, 2020 after fight-
ing as hard as he could for two weeks. As he 
slipped into twilight his family was able to sur-
round him. He passed from this life on the 
holy day of the Feast of the Immaculate Con-
ception, fitting for a Catholic man who humbly 
revered the Virgin Mary. 
The only son in an Italian immigrant family, 
Pasquale DiTerlizzi became a fixture and a 
legend in his shoe shop’s neighborhood of 
West Toledo, his St. Anthony’s Church family 
and the farm community of Temperance, 
Michigan. 
Born the third child of Mauro and Lucy 
Saccucci DiTerlizzi, Pasquale attended St. 
Charles grade school and Libbey High School 
in Toledo, Ohio. Immediately after graduation, 
Pasquale entered into U.S. military service, on 
active duty 1941 to 1944, working as a welder 
on ships. When he returned to Toledo after 
the war, his brother-in-law took him into his 
own shoe shop where he learned the art of 
shoemaking. In 1947, Pasquale opened up his 
own shoe shop on Upton Avenue in West To-
ledo, where it remains to this day. In addition 
to shoe repair, he took college courses to 
learn how to make orthopedic shoes and be-
came adept at any leather repair of any kind 
including saddles, riding gear, belts, coats and 
purses. Even, his shop was the place to go for 
tap shoes. Family vacations were spent at 
shoe conventions, and the shop grew through 
its 73 years as he worked with his children 
Anita, Patsy, Mario, Tina, Dino and Mari and 
his wife Juanita. Leading up to this last illness, 
Pasquale, age 97, still worked at the shop. 
Not driving the last few years, he made sure 
someone in the family took him to the shop 
every day. 
In 1948, Pasquale DiTerlizzi married Juanita 
Gackstetter and together they raised six chil-
dren, first in West Toledo and then on their 
family farm a short distance in Michigan. 
The farm was a hive of activity with many 
special family events and a busy, active fam-
ily. Deeply faithful, the DiTerlizzi family be-
came synonymous with St. Anthony’s Catholic 
Church in Temperance soon after the move to 
the farm. For decades, Pasquale was a lead-
ing parishioner at St. Anthony’s, where his 
family initiated its famous spaghetti dinner 
fundraisers. As the family grew, many wed-
dings, Catholic rites and family gatherings 
were celebrated at St. Anthony’s. 
Pasquale DiTerlizzi leaves a legacy of life, 
love and faith to his children, grandchildren, 
great-grandchildren, and extended family. Ev-
eryone he knew received a strong handshake, 
a warm look in the eye and a smile. His 
Catholic faith held him strong through adver-
sity, joy and sorrow and it holds his family 
firmly now as they move forward. 
As Pasquale DiTerlizzi journeyed home he 
was surely met by his wife Juanita and second 
wife Romelda, his daughter Anita, his sisters 
Virginia, Antoinette and Lena, his parents, 
cousins, aunts and uncles who preceded him 
in death. He lakes his leave as the Patriarch 
of his family, but his spirit imbues them all. We 
wish them comfort in memories as they forge 
ahead and honor the life of this remarkable 
man.
