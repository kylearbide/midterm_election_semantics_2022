HOLDING CHINA ACCOUNTABLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, more than a year into the 
COVID–19 pandemic, I rise once again 
to bring attention to the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s role in this public 
health and economic crisis and to call 
for a full congressional investigation 
into the origin of the virus. 
Day after day, we learn more facts 
and evidence that confirm what we 
have expected from the beginning: The 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
inten-
tionally covered up the COVID–19 out-
break, squandering valuable time, cre-
ating dangerous misinformation, and, 
ultimately, costing lives. 
Over a year ago, the China Task 
Force began raising real questions 
about the origin of the virus. At that 
time, the mainstream media and others 
dismissed our concerns. Despite their 
objections, we continued in our efforts 
to expose this coverup. 
Now, after lives and livelihoods have 
been destroyed, President Biden and 
the Democrats finally are asking ques-
tions about this virus. They finally are 
waking up to reality. 
Not only did this pandemic start in 
China, but the World Health Organiza-
tion acted as a willing pawn of the Chi-
nese Government to cover up this virus 
and hide it from the world. 
After taking office, one of President 
Biden’s first actions was rejoining the 
World Health Organization at taxpayer 
expense, without requiring a single re-
form to its corrupt culture. 
Time 
and 
time 
again, 
President 
Biden has failed to hold the Chinese 
Communist Party accountable. Now, 
this Congress must act. 
Last year, the China Task Force de-
veloped more than 400 commonsense 
solutions to counter the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s threat to our health, 
our economy, and our way of life. We 
could start by implementing these leg-
islative solutions and restoring Amer-
ica’s leadership in 21st century innova-
tion. 
As a Congress, we also should build 
upon the China Task Force’s investiga-
tion into the COVID–19 pandemic ori-
gin, including whether the virus was 
engineered at the Wuhan lab. 
Why delay? How many more Ameri-
cans will need to be infected before we 
say ‘‘enough’’? 
As my friend, Leader KEVIN MCCAR-
THY has outlined, we need to demand 
transparency, and we must seek jus-
tice. We need to get to the bottom of 
this question and allow the truth to 
come to light. 
Thanks to American ingenuity, resil-
ience, and perseverance, our Nation has 
embarked on the long path to recovery. 
However, while new virus cases are on 
the decline, the pandemic isn’t over. 
For the families of more than 600,000 
Americans who have died from COVID– 
19, grief still lingers. 
For the thousands of Americans 
struggling with post-COVID syndrome, 
the virus remains a central part of 
their lives each and every day. 
For small business leaders struggling 
to keep their doors open amid the cur-
rent workforce shortage, there is still a 
crisis. 
Holding China accountable for the 
pandemic is still very relevant. We 
cannot drag our feet. We cannot just 
move on. 
This is the time for Congress to get 
serious about our oversight responsibil-
ities and fully investigate the origin of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Today, I urge Speaker PELOSI and 
House Democrats to join with Repub-
licans in exposing this regime’s blame 
in the pandemic and demanding an-
swers from the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
We must ensure that this hostile re-
gime never again is allowed to unleash 
a virus onto our shores. As we have 
seen, lives and livelihoods are on the 
line.

SCIENCE IS NOT A PARTISAN 
ISSUE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. NEHLS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, more than 
600,000 Americans have reportedly died 
from COVID–19; grandfathers, grand-
mothers, fathers, mothers, brothers, 
sisters, sons, and daughters. The true

June 22, 2021 
toll of this disease will never be fully 
understood; not only the loss of life, 
but the loss of the means to provide for 
one’s family for those who survived, 
the mental anguish over the loss of a 
loved one, and the fear and uncertainty 
of the future. 
It is unfortunate that, despite all 
this suffering, COVID–19 has devolved 
into a partisan issue, each side bick-
ering as to who is to blame. Despite 
that, science is not a partisan issue. 
The facts are this disease killed hun-
dreds of thousands of Americans. It is 
one of the deadliest diseases to ever hit 
America. And, for good reason, many 
Americans want to know how it hap-
pened to ensure it never happens again. 
That should be a bipartisan pursuit. 
But, 
unfortunately, 
my 
colleagues 
across the aisle, led by Speaker PELOSI, 
have stonewalled our attempts to in-
vestigate the origins of COVID–19, and 
they have done so even in the face of 
mounting evidence and unanswered 
questions. 
There have been so many theories 
circulating as to how COVID–19 origi-
nated. Some in the scientific commu-
nity say it was of natural origins, some 
say it was of manmade origins. 
Can we expect the American people 
to educate themselves on virology and 
the origins of COVID–19? No. What we 
can expect is they demand Congress do 
its job, investigate, and get to the bot-
tom of exactly where this virus came 
from and how it was so devastating to 
America. 
What we know, based on evidence and 
research, is that this virus didn’t have 
to be as deadly as it was. Attempts by 
the Chinese Communist Party to cover 
up and deceive delayed global readiness 
in preparing for the devastation of 
COVID–19. 
A 2020 report by the University of 
Southampton found if interventions in 
China would have been conducted 1 
week earlier, cases could have been re-
duced by 66 percent; 2 weeks earlier, 
cases could have been reduced by 86 
percent; and if interventions by China 
had been conducted 3 weeks earlier, 
cases could have been reduced by 95 
percent. 
Mounting evidence continues to indi-
cate the CCP intentionally hid infor-
mation and lied about what it knew 
about the virus. Additionally, World 
Health Organization Director-General 
Tedros Adhanom knowingly and will-
fully downplayed or outright denied 
the Chinese Communist Party’s neg-
ligence, and, instead, chose to cower 
rather than stand up for the inter-
national community. 
I am as angry as any American over 
the avoidable loss of life, loss of liveli-
hood, and loss of future due to the 
CCP’s COVID–19 coverup. We must get 
to the bottom of how it started and 
how they deceived the rest of the globe, 
and that is exactly what Republicans 
have been working toward. 
House Republicans have introduced 
numerous measures to hold the Chinese 
Communist Party accountable for their 
malfeasance, only to be blocked by 
Democrats. This has not shaken our re-
solve. We will continue to do the peo-
ple’s business in the people’s House. 
Holding China accountable requires 
transparency and justice. We need to 
declassify intelligence surrounding the 
origins of COVID–19. The American 
people have a right to know. 
We need to evaluate and defund any 
investments in gain of function re-
search with the CCP or China. We need 
to reform the World Health Organiza-
tion by advocating for new leadership 
and transparency. And we need to pur-
sue visa and economic sanctions on 
members of the CCP and any others re-
sponsible for the COVID–19 coverup. 
We need to send a loud and clear mes-
sage to the globe that America will 
hold those responsible for the COVID– 
19 coverup accountable. We must leave 
no doubt that if you lie to America and 
cause death of her people, there will be 
hell to pay. 
f 
SUPPORTING THE SPECIAL 
IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. WALTZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about our local allies in 
Afghanistan, those that are trying to 
come to the United States through the 
Special Immigrant Visa program. 
Beside me here is one of the brave Af-
ghan interpreters who stood alongside 
my Special Forces unit, my fellow 
Green Berets, in Afghanistan during 
one of my tours. He volunteered for 
that duty. He stood with us in combat. 
He faced extremism head-on. 
And when these brave Afghans stand 
up, Mr. Speaker, to stand with us, to 
stand with our soldiers, as a critical 
asset that enables us to deal with the 
populous and communicate with the 
populous that we are trying to protect, 
but also fight alongside our Afghan se-
curity forces partners, we could not do 
what we have done in the last 20 years 
in Afghanistan and around the world in 
places like Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and in 
places like Africa, without these brave 
individuals who not only put their lives 
on the line but put their families’ lives 
on the line to stand with us against ex-
tremism. 
We called him Spartacus. We didn’t 
use his real name, because if the 
Taliban found out that he was with us, 
they would not only track him down, 
they would track his entire family 
down. 
Well, unfortunately, after our rede-
ployment, Mr. Speaker, the very thing 
that he needed to get a visa to the 
United States, the identification paper-
work that he had fought with the 
United States, that he had fought with 
America, was found on him in a 
Taliban checkpoint. He was taken back 
to his home village and beheaded, 
along with his brothers and cousins in 
his family. 
This story of Spartacus is happening 
right now, as we speak. The Taliban, as 
they slowly and methodically take 
over Afghanistan, are hunting these 
brave individuals down who stood with 
us against extremism. 
We need to ask ourselves, as Ameri-
cans, what message are we sending in 
terms of keeping our promises, not 
only with the Afghans, but again, 
around the world? The bottom line is, 
we need to get them out. We have a 
moral obligation to get them out. 
This is not just a moral obligation, 
but it is a national security obligation. 
The State Department has a 14-step 
process that takes over a year to do 
the appropriate vetting and to assign 
these visas. We don’t have time for 
that anymore with U.S. forces with-
drawing within weeks. 
The Defense Department is ready to 
do an evacuation right now. The Gov-
ernor of Guam has said he is ready to 
accept these people, as they have done 
with our partners in South Vietnam, as 
they did with the South Koreans, as 
they have done with Cubans. We can 
process them in a safe third country 
and then bring those individuals home. 
The Defense Department says they 
are ready; Guam says they are ready. 
Everyone is waiting on the green light 
from the White House. 
Where is that green light, Mr. Speak-
er? Where is it? Will President Biden 
stand up and stand with those and do 
the right thing for those that fought 
with us? 
And I have to be candid, he hasn’t al-
ways done so. He didn’t support the 
evacuation of our South Vietnamese 
allies when he was a Senator. I pray 
and hope he will correct that past sin 
and stand with those who stood with us 
against extremism. 
I mentioned this is a national secu-
rity issue as well. The Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs, Mr. Speaker, just testi-
fied that he believes there is a decent 
likelihood, a medium probability, that 
al-Qaida will come roaring back in the 
wake of our withdrawal. So we must 
also ask ourselves, when our soldiers 
have to go back into Afghanistan, who 
are they going to have to fight along-
side? Will they have anyone left that 
will not have been hunted down like 
Spartacus was? 
b 1215 
Finally, this isn’t just an interpreter 
issue. Twenty-five percent of the Af-
ghan 
Parliament 
is 
set 
aside 
for 
women. These women are also being 
hunted, abused, forced to stay home, 
not go into their elected office. Some 
have had acid thrown on their face. 
Some are even executed themselves. 
Civil society leaders, journalists, all 
those who have spoken out against the 
atrocities that we have seen, that we 
have fought against are also being tar-
geted. 
We have an obligation, as an Amer-
ican people, as a military, to support 
those who have stood with us. 
Mr. Speaker, should we not, time is 
running out. The world is watching, 
and when that last American soldier

CONGRATULATING TERRY HAMBY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate Terry Hamby of Trigg 
County, Kentucky, for receiving the 
Distinguished Public Service Award for 
his outstanding leadership as chairman 
of the World War I Centennial Commis-
sion. Under Terry’s leadership the com-
mission completed the construction of 
the United States National World War 
I Memorial here in Washington, D.C. 
There is no one who better under-
stands the sacrifices of our service-
members than Terry. He served for 26 
years in our Nation’s military, first in 
the Naval Air Wing during the Vietnam 
war before joining the U.S. Army Re-
serve. 
After his retirement, Terry contin-
ued to honor and serve our Nation’s 
military, and was appointed to the 
World War I Centennial Commission, 
and elected chairman in 2017. In just 
four years under his leadership, the 
United States National World War I 
Memorial was completed and opened to 
the public. 
I am privileged to represent Terry in 
Congress, and I appreciate all he does 
to recognize our Nation’s military. I 
join Terry’s family, friends, and all of 
those impacted by his life of service in 
congratulating him on this enormous 
contribution to our Nation. 
CONGRATULATING VERNON ANDERSON 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Mr. Vernon An-
derson of Calloway County on his in-
duction 
into 
the 
Kentucky 
Trapshooters League Hall of Fame. 
Vernon has qualified 10 times for the 
Kentucky State trapshooters team and 
has been a member of the Kentucky 
Trapshooters League’s board of direc-
tors for the past 12 years. He humbly 
describes himself as a consistently 
good trap shooter, but anyone who can 
hit 99 out of 100 moving targets at var-
ious distances is nothing less than a 
great shot. 
Vernon has always paved the way for 
younger generations to participate in 
trap shooting. In 2015, his activism led 
trap shooting to become an official 
high school sport in Kentucky. He then 
became Calloway County High School’s 
coach, where he has passed on his 
knowledge and passion for the sport to 
students. 
Once again, I would like to congratu-
late my friend Vernon on this great 
honor and thank him for his continued 
service to the students of Calloway 
County, Kentucky. 
ECONOMIC ISSUES AND RISING INFLATION 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
discuss the current state of our econ-
omy. 
With ill-advised lockdowns finally 
ending, our economy should be firing 
on all cylinders. Unfortunately, we are, 
in many ways, stuck in the mud. 
America has seen a string of dis-
appointing jobs reports that fall short 
of expectations, and excessive govern-
ment spending is driving up what is ef-
fectively a tax increase on every Amer-
ican—inflation. 
Over 8 million jobs are available, 
even as the government pays people 
not to work. This is creating a dra-
matic workforce shortage and forcing 
our job creators to compete with the 
heavy hand of government. In fact, our 
labor participation rate sits at just 61 
percent, the lowest total this century 
when you exclude the opening months 
of the pandemic. 
And the massive spending rammed 
through by President Biden and Speak-
er PELOSI is only hurting us. Inflation 
is surging, affecting the price of every-
day items Americans buy, like milk 
and gasoline. 
This $2 trillion in new spending came 
despite an economy that was reopening 
and on the mend, and it made Ameri-
cans less likely to work and the gov-
ernment more likely to waste hard- 
earned tax dollars. 
But for our Democrat friends, this 
wasteful spending knows no bounds. 
President Biden has proposed an out-
rageous $6 trillion Federal budget that 
is a slap in the face to every American 
taxpayer. 
Instead of focusing on a responsible 
infrastructure bill that repairs our 
roads and bridges and puts people to 
work, we see a focus by this body on 
ramming through the Green New Deal 
and more wasteful spending. 
As leaders, we must change course to 
create a stronger recovery. As our 
economy reopens, we must respect tax-
payers, support small businesses, and 
empower Americans to prosper through 
the dignity of work. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF PRIVATE 
FIRST CLASS ERNEST ROBERTSON 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Private First Class Er-
nest Robertson of Russell County, Ken-
tucky, who served and paid the ulti-
mate sacrifice in the Korean war. Er-
nest was killed in action at 24 years 
old, but his remains have never been 
recovered. 
After basic training at Fort Knox, 
Ernest was assigned to the U.S. Army’s 
Far East Command, M Company, 19th 
Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Divi-
sion. On April 23, 1951, he suffered a 
terrible injury and was captured by 
North Korean forces. On May 6, one day 
after his 24th birthday, Ernest was 
killed in action. 
The service and sacrifice of our 
troops must never be forgotten, even 
long after they have perished. It is 
truly a tragedy that some brave sol-
diers have not yet made it home after 
their horrible death. We must appre-
ciate their sacrifice and remember the 
cost of freedoms we enjoy here in the 
United States. 
I join with all the First District of 
Kentucky in thanking Private First 
Class Robertson for his service, and his 
family for their efforts to remember 
him. He will always be in our thoughts.

God, our creator, redeemer, 
and 
friend, we offer to You all that we have 
and all that we are this day: Our cares 
and concerns, our annoyances and ag-
gravations, our fears and frustrations, 
our tempers and our entanglements, as 
well as our hopes and happiness, our 
competence and self-confidence, our 
strength and our service. 
We ask that You would recreate our 
spirits that we would have what we 
need to face the vagaries of life with 
renewed purpose and emboldened faith; 
that You would redeem our lives and 
the circumstances we face, that from 
our anxiety and uncertainty would 
emerge courage and wisdom; and that 
You would remind us of the joys of 
daily life, the blessings of home and 
the warmth of friendship, that through 
them we would find the gift of Your 
abiding presence upholding us in the ef-
fort of our labors and the living of our 
days. 
In the redemption of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

H2938 
June 22, 2021 
CHILD TAX CREDIT MONTHLY 
PAYMENTS 
(Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
it is an honor to be with you today and 
to tell everyone how excited I am that 
on July 15 checks are going to be arriv-
ing at the homes of families with chil-
dren who have been struggling for a 
year and a half, and many have really 
come to the brink because of the pan-
demic that we are facing. 
This is the child tax credit that is ac-
tually going to reduce child poverty by 
half in the United States of America. It 
was part of the American Rescue Plan, 
which we passed in January, and now it 
is going to come to help people in the 
form of a check. These payments pro-
vide poor, working- and middle-class 
families with meaningful tax relief. 
In my district, over 70 percent of 
children will benefit from the expanded 
credit; over 100,000 families in total. 
This is the result of our work to make 
sure that families are no longer suf-
fering because of the pandemic.

HONORING GUY DANELLA ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor New York Mills Police 
Officer Guy Danella, who retired from 
law enforcement after 23 years this 
past month. 
Guy, a native of my hometown of 
New Hartford, began his service in law 
enforcement in 1998, with the Oneida 
County Sheriff’s Department as a cor-
rections deputy. During that time, Guy 
realized he wanted to continue his ca-
reer as a police officer and became a 
deputy sheriff with the road patrol in 
2000, where he spent 2 years on the DWI 
patrol. 
In 2004, Guy began his career with the 
New York Mills Police Department, 
where he would serve for the next 17 
years. During his service with New 
York Mills, Guy became a field train-
ing officer, helping to mentor new offi-
cers, and was honored with a number of 
service awards, including the Meri-
torious Service Award, Exceptional 
Service Award, and the Patriot Award. 
It was an honor to meet with Guy 
and his amazing daughter, Alex. I hope 
she fulfills her dream to go to law 
school someday. 
Guy, we thank you for your many 
years of service to our wonderful com-
munity and for helping to train our 
next generation of heroes. Our commu-
nity is truly grateful. 
f 
AMATEUR RADIO SERVES AN 
IMPORTANT PURPOSE 
(Mrs. LESKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the important contribu-
tions of amateur radio operators in Ar-
izona and across the Nation. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, 
amateur radio has served an important 
purpose. From providing a means of 
communication in times of crisis, to 
assisting emergency operators in nat-
ural disasters, amateur radio operators 
are an important part of the commu-
nities across our country. 
Arizona is home to at least 23,000 
amateur radio operators and hundreds 
of amateur radio groups and clubs. 
This week, the American Radio Relay 
League will host their annual field day, 
where thousands of amateur radio 
groups across the country will prepare 
for future crises. 
Since 1933, amateur radio operators 
have practiced the rapid and effective 
deployment of radio communications 
equipment through these field day 
events. 
I am honored to recognize the impor-
tant contributions of amateur radio op-
erators, and I wish them a safe and ef-
fective field day this weekend. 
f 
RECOGNIZING OZZIE FLETCHER 
(Ms. MALLIOTAKIS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise to tell the story of Ozzie 
Fletcher. 
Seventy-seven years ago, on D-day, 
June 
6, 
1944, 
22-year-old 
Osceola 
‘‘Ozzie’’ Fletcher was working as an 
Army crane operator on Omaha Beach 
when he was hit by a German missile, 
leaving him with serious wounds on his 
leg and head. 
Despite the injuries he sustained that 
day, Ozzie was overlooked, in fact, de-
nied a Purple Heart simply because of 
the color of his skin. At the time, our 
forces were segregated, where Black 
soldiers 
could 
not 
serve 
alongside 
White soldiers. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff learned of Ozzie’s story, sending 
the Army on a 2-month-long fact-find-
ing mission. 
This weekend I was honored to at-
tend the ceremony at Fort Hamilton 
Army Base in my district in Brooklyn, 
New York, when an historic wrong was 
corrected and Ozzie was finally award-
ed the Purple Heart he earned more 
than seven decades ago, as the Nation 
observed Juneteenth. This recognition 
of Ozzie’s service was long overdue. 
I have great and profound apprecia-
tion for his service during World War II 
and his acts of bravery on that fateful 
day that changed the course of our 
world’s history. 
After the war, Ozzie served as a ser-
geant with the NYPD, a community re-
lations officer in the Brooklyn District 
Attorney’s Office, and later retired to 
become a social studies teacher in New 
York City public schools. 
Ozzie has spent his entire life giving 
back to our country and the residents 
of New York City, and I am happy to 
see him finally get the recognition he 
deserves.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1374. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 1374, the Enhancing 
State Energy Security Planning and 
Emergency Preparedness Act of 2021. 
This is a bipartisan bill introduced 
by my colleagues on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. I thank the 
bill’s sponsors, Energy Subcommittee 
Chairman 
BOBBY
RUSH
and 
Sub-
committee 
Ranking 
Member 
FRED 
UPTON for their work and leadership on 
this legislation. 
This is an urgent and necessary bi-
partisan bill. In the wake of the Colo-
nial Pipeline cyberattack and other re-
cent cyber threats to our infrastruc-
ture, we are reminded of the con-
sequences of physical and cyber at-
tacks. 
H.R. 1374 provides Federal guidance 
and resources to the States that are 
most vulnerable to critical energy in-
frastructure threats. The State Energy 
Program is a popular, bipartisan pro-
gram designed to support State energy 
offices. Funding for the State Energy 
Program is used for several energy ini-
tiatives, including developing energy 
security plans to help prevent disasters 
from happening and to mitigate and re-
cover from any damage that does 
occur. 
This bill will help allocate additional 
resources to further develop and en-
hance State energy security plans. The 
funding provided in this bill will facili-
tate the implementation, review, and 
revision of State energy security plans 
while also laying out the criteria for 
the contents of those plans. 
Mr. Speaker, recent events like the 
Colonial Pipeline cyberattack have 
highlighted the importance of invest-
ing in the physical and cyber security 
of our energy systems. This legislation 
passed our committee and the House 
with overwhelming support from both 
Republicans and Democrats in the last 
Congress. It also enjoys strong support 
from the nonpartisan National Associa-
tion of State Energy Organizations. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for this bipartisan bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
H.R. 1374 is a bipartisan bill that has 
long-time support in the House. We 
passed it by voice vote on suspension in 
the 115th Congress and again in the 
116th Congress. The legislation reau-
thorizes the State Energy Program and 
strengthens 
our 
energy 
emergency 
planning and preparedness efforts. 
This is an important bill, and we are 
reminded why every year when we wit-
ness how States must respond to a va-
riety of hazards, including hurricanes, 
earthquakes, floods, fuel supply disrup-
tions, and physical and cyber threats. 
We have had harmful hurricanes and 
will continue to do so. Consequently, 
there is an ongoing urgency for State 
energy planning and action. 
The electricity crises in Texas and 
surrounding States this past winter 
provides a vivid example for State re-
sponses to energy emergencies; and, of 
course, the Colonial Pipeline incident 
last month had State energy officials 
working with Federal authorities to 
make sure people had fuel when they 
needed it. 
b 1415 
This legislation provides States with 
the flexibility they need to address 
local energy challenges. 
It also ensures that State energy se-
curity planning efforts address fuel 
supply issues, assess State energy pro-
files, address potential hazards to each 
energy sector, mitigate risk to enhance 
reliability, and incorporate regional 
planning efforts. 
H.R. 1374 also helps States protect 
fuel and electric infrastructure from 
physical and cybersecurity threats and 
vulnerabilities. It makes sure we are 
thinking ahead, not just about an ac-
tual threat, but how our energy and 
electric systems might be vulnerable in 
a broader sense. 
The bill also encourages mutual as-
sistance, an essential part of respond-
ing and restoring in the event of an en-
ergy emergency. 
Prioritizing and elevating energy se-
curity planning and emergency pre-
paredness is an important step in the 
face of increased threats, vulnerabili-
ties, and interdependencies of energy 
infrastructure and end-use systems. 
Protecting energy security requires 
defense in depth, which means a strong 
energy sector, strong State capabili-
ties, and ensuring sector agencies like 
the Department of Energy have the 
tools they need to respond to energy 
emergencies. This ensures we can help 
people in energy emergencies, whether 
caused by weather or cyberattack, and 
help them when they need it most. 
I urge support of H.R. 1374, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I would 
state in conclusion that I urge strong 
support for H.R. 1374, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge bipartisan support for this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1374. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 482. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 482, the Newborn Screening 
Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 
2021. 
Newborn screening is a well-estab-
lished and proven public health pro-
gram that identifies certain genetic 
and functional conditions in newborns. 
Each year, almost all of the 3.8 million 
babies born in the U.S. are screened for 
medical conditions that can cause seri-
ous disability or death if not detected 
and treated early. 
Newborn screening includes blood, 
hearing, and heart screening. While 
most families may likely forget this 
routine testing ever took place, more 
than 12,000 families each year will be 
notified of a positive screening result 
and referred for immediate diagnosis 
and treatment. Many of these families 
might not have considered or had ac-
cess to these tests without newborn 
screening. 
Newborns 
can 
appear 
healthy but, without warning, can 
quickly deteriorate due to these unde-
tected conditions, and that is why 
these tests are so critical. If diagnosed 
early, many of these conditions can be 
treated and managed successfully. 
In 2008, the original Newborn Screen-
ing Saves Lives Act was signed into 
law. It established national newborn 
screening guidelines and supported the 
facilitation of newborn screening at 
the State level. Before 2008, only 10 
States and the District of Columbia re-
quired 
newborn 
screening 
for 
rec-
ommended disorders. Today, all 50 
States and D.C. screen for most or all 
of these recommended diseases. 
This bipartisan program was reau-
thorized in 2014 and 2019. Those reau-
thorizations renewed Federal support 
to help States to expand and improve 
their newborn screening programs. 
H.R. 482, before us today, once again 
renews Federal funds and activities to 
assist States in continuing and improv-
ing their newborn screening programs. 
This bill also supports parent and pro-
vider education and laboratory quality 
and surveillance. 
Newborn screening, Mr. Speaker, is a 
simple set of tests that can improve 
and save the lives of thousands of ba-
bies so that they and their families can 
grow to live healthy and happy lives. 
Through the national expansion of 
these life-saving health screenings, no 
baby should receive inadequate care 
because of the State that they live in. 
With the continuous reauthorization of 
the Newborn Screening Saves Lives 
Act, every baby in the U.S. can have 
access to equitable healthcare from the 
day they are born. 
I commend the steadfast champions 
of this bipartisan legislation—fore-
most, Representative LUCILLE ROYBAL- 
ALLARD, who has been working on this 
for such a long time, and this is some-
thing that she and I have talked about 
quite a bit, and Congressman SIMPSON, 
Congresswoman 
HERRERA
BEUTLER, 
and 
Assistant 
Speaker 
KATHERINE 
CLARK for their ongoing commitment 
and leadership toward eliminating pre-
ventable newborn deaths. No newborn 
should suffer or die from a condition 
that can be detected and treated by 
newborn screening. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to control the time 
on this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 482, the Newborn Screening 
Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 
2021. 
Newborn screening is critical in the 
early detection and intervention of 
health conditions, some life-threat-
ening, for our Nation’s infants. They 
are for serious but rare conditions that 
families and doctors may otherwise be 
unable to detect at birth. Newborns are 
screened in the hospital when they are 
1 or 2 days old by blood tests, in addi-
tion to hearing and heart screenings. 
About 1 in 300 newborns has a condi-
tion that can be detected via newborn 
screening. However, if not detected and 
left untreated, these conditions can im-
pact a child for the rest of their life by 
causing 
disabilities, 
developmental 
delays, illness, or even death. 
Prior to the passage of the first New-
born Screening Saves Lives Act in 2008, 
which helped better standardize screen-
ing 
programs, 
States 
had 
varying 
standards for newborn screening, and 
they were not screening for many of 
the 
core 
conditions 
on 
the 
Rec-
ommended Uniform Screening Panel. 
This bill authorizes funding for the 
Health Resources and Services Admin-
istration, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, and the National 
Institutes of Health to ensure that our 
newborn screening remains comprehen-
sive and that our Nation’s healthcare 
providers are adequately equipped to 
conduct the screenings. 
Specifically, H.R. 482 reauthorizes 
grants through the Health Resources 
and Services Administration to expand 
State screening programs and improve 
follow-up care after a detection, in ad-
dition to allowing for the National In-
stitutes of Health Hunter Kelly New-
born Screening program to continue to 
identify new treatments for conditions 
detected by newborn screening. 
The 
importance 
of 
newborn 
screenings can’t be overstated. Screen-
ing provides physicians and families 
with critical information regarding in-
fant health, allowing for early inter-
vention and treatment, if necessary. 
I urge my fellow Members to support 
H.R. 482, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROY-
BAL-ALLARD), the prime sponsor of this 
legislation. 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to support reauthorization of my 
Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act. I 
thank Chairman PALLONE for his sup-
port and for bringing my bill to the 
floor. 
My sincere gratitude to my newborn 
screening 
partners 
and 
colleagues, 
MIKE SIMPSON, KATHERINE CLARK, and 
JAIME
HERRERA
BEUTLER, 
and 
my 
heartfelt appreciation to the public 
health groups that continue to support 
my newborn screening efforts, includ-
ing the March of Dimes, the Associa-
tion of Public Health Laboratories, the 
Muscular Dystrophy Association, and

June 22, 2021 
the National Organization for Rare 
Disorders. 
Newborn screening involves a baby 
receiving a simple blood test to iden-
tify life-threatening diseases before 
symptoms begin. Prior to the develop-
ment of these tests, children would die 
or suffer lifelong disabilities. 
In 2008, when my original bill passed, 
newborn screenings and access to fol-
low-up information were not consistent 
or available to families in all commu-
nities. Only 10 States and the District 
of Columbia required screening for a 
complete panel of recommended dis-
orders, and there was no Federal repos-
itory of information on the diseases. 
Today, all 50 States and D.C. screen 
for at least 30 of the 35 recommended 
core conditions, and a national clear-
inghouse has the most recent newborn 
screening information available to par-
ents and professionals. 
Newborn screening is a public health 
success story that makes the difference 
between health and disability, or even 
life and death, for the approximately 
12,000 babies who each year test posi-
tive for one of these conditions, babies 
like Cruz, a beautiful little girl born on 
February 4 this year to one of my dis-
trict office deputies. Thanks to new-
born screening, in just 4 days, Cruz was 
diagnosed with maple syrup urine dis-
ease, which prevents the body from 
breaking down certain amino acids 
typically obtained from protein. 
If Cruz’s disease had gone undetected, 
the buildup of amino acids in her body 
would have become toxic, leading to 
seizures, swelling of the brain, coma, 
and, ultimately, death. Today, the 
management of her amino acid levels 
keeps Cruz out of the hospital, protects 
her from critical medical complica-
tions, and gives her family the gift of 
watching 
their 
daughter 
grow 
up 
healthy. 
This is just one of the thousands of 
success stories that illustrate the crit-
ical need to pass H.R. 482 into law. This 
will guarantee high-quality technical 
assistance for State programs and pub-
lic health labs, access to the most cur-
rent programs and educational mate-
rials, and it will ensure the advisory 
committee continues its work of re-
searching 
and 
recommending 
new 
screenings for State programs, which 
also save our healthcare system mil-
lions of dollars for each child identified 
and treated early. 
Reauthorization will also commis-
sion a National Academy of Sciences 
study to make recommendations for a 
21st century newborn screening sys-
tem. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the passage of H.R. 482 to ensure all 
newborns like Cruz are blessed with 
early, comprehensive, and consistent 
testing and follow-up programs for a 
healthy and productive life. 
b 1430 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
bill and encourage others to do so. 
When I first was elected to the State 
Senate, the General Assembly of Ken-
tucky, one of the biggest public policy 
efforts I got involved in was Governor 
Patton—our governor at the time—who 
was proposing a big 0–3 kind of overall 
for Kentucky’s babies and children, and 
a big part of it was newborn screenings. 
And that was a section I was kind of 
assigned to look into and I spent a lot 
of time doing research—even going 
down to see a lady who does this kind 
of research at Vanderbilt University 
and walked away convinced that it is 
the right public policy to do. It is 
money well-spent. It really changes 
people’s ability. If you can’t get your 
language at an early time, you can 
never get it back. 
So this absolutely prevents—if you 
want to look at the cost of this system, 
this system going forward, but more 
importantly, it really enhances people 
to have the opportunity to live a full 
life if we catch it at the youngest level. 
So I am convinced of this. I support 
this bill, and I encourage my col-
leagues to do so. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
also ask Members to support this legis-
lation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 482. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3752. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 3752. 
I begin by thanking Representatives 
CA´ RDENAS, CASTOR, DAVIS, and UPTON 
for their leadership on this bill, the 
Pandemic Effects on Home Safety and 
Tourism Act. 
While there is now light at the end of 
the tunnel for many Americans, the 
past 15 months have been unlike any 
other time in modern history. The 
COVID–19 pandemic has forced us to 
spend more time at home and find new 
indoor and outdoor activities suitable 
for social distancing, which has re-
sulted in new injury patterns. Keeping 
track of any new trends in injuries and 
deaths that might be occurring can 
help us learn how to keep consumers 
safer at home now as well as in the fu-
ture. 
This bill will require the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission to provide 
quarterly updates to the American 
public regarding the effects of COVID– 
19 on home safety, including any 
emerging threats from either new prod-
ucts or new habits from working and 
playing at home. This report will as-
semble data from a variety of sources, 
including media reports and poison 
control centers, in addition to the 
CPSC’s traditional data sources. 
Initial reports from the CPSC about 
injuries related to consumer products 
during COVID–19 are already con-
cerning. For example, hospitalizations 
related to the ingestion of dangerous 
button cell batteries rose by 93 percent 
among young children during the pe-
riod from March to September 2020, and 
injuries related to cleaning agents also 
rose 84 percent. 
Continued regular reporting required 
by this legislation can help parents 
better identify how to keep their chil-
dren safe when they need to stay at 
home. And this bill will also identify 
communities or groups that may be 
disproportionately affected so that the 
CPSC can better target efforts to pro-
tect these communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that 
this bill will also help rebuild the tour-
ism and travel industry, which has cer-
tainly struggled under the strain of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Specifically, this 
legislation requires the Department of 
Commerce to conduct a detailed study 
and 
report 
to 
Congress 
on 
the 
pandemic’s effects on the travel indus-
try, including on jobs and revenue. And 
this information will be helpful in de-
termining how we can best direct as-
sistance to the 16 million American 
workers and families who rely on the 
jobs the travel industry supports. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank our Ranking 
Member RODGERS, and our Consumer 
Protection 
and 
Commerce 
Sub-
committee Ranking Member BILIRAKIS, 
for working with us to build bipartisan 
support. And, of course, I also thank 
the chairwoman of this subcommittee, 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY). 
Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues 
to support this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 3752, the Pandemic Ef-
fects on Home Safety and Tourism Act. 
I 
first 
thank 
Representatives 
CA´ RDENAS and DAVIS for their efforts 
on this bill to protect consumers. I also 
thank Representatives UPTON and CAS-
TOR for including provisions to pro-
mote and assist our tourism industry, 
an essential component of our Nation’s 
economy, and something I care deeply 
about as cochair of the Congressional 
Tourism Caucus. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3752 directs the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission 
to report on trends of injuries and 
deaths from consumer products during 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic. 
As 
more 
Americans have spent time in their 
homes, it is important the CPSC con-
tinues to inform consumers with infor-
mation about potentially hazardous 
products. 
Additionally, H.R. 3752 requires the 
Department of Commerce to study and 
report on how the COVID–19 pandemic 
has impacted our travel and tourism 
industry. This industry plays a signifi-
cant role in many local communities 
and supports over 50 million jobs across 
the Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY), the chairwoman of the sub-
committee. 
I also want to say that she is really 
our superhero when it comes to these 
consumer issues, always looking out 
for 
things, 
because 
as 
the 
world 
changes, we have to constantly be vigi-
lant. And that, she certainly is. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding and 
for his kind words. 
I also thank the authors of this legis-
lation, 
Representatives 
CA´ RDENAS, 
DAVIS, CASTOR, and UPTON, a bipartisan 
leadership group on this legislation. 
And I also thank the ranking mem-
ber of the subcommittee, Mr. BILI-
RAKIS, for his cooperation on this and 
so many other issues. 
Mr. Speaker, children are particu-
larly vulnerable to risks associated 
with household consumer products. 
These risks have been magnified by the 
pandemic as families spend more time 
at home and parents juggle working 
from home and supervising children. 
This legislation will direct the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission to 
study and report injuries and deaths 
associated 
with 
consumer 
products 
during the pandemic. A lot of progress 
has been made, but the pandemic is not 
yet over. 
Americans deserve up-to-date infor-
mation about emerging threats to the 
safety of their children, and so this leg-
islation is very important. 
This legislation also directs the De-
partment of Commerce to study and re-
port to the Congress on the impact of 
the pandemic on the travel and tour-
ism industries. 
These industries were really hit hard 
by the pandemic. Over 15.7 million 
Americans work in travel or tourism. 
Many of these jobs are just now start-
ing to come back. Industries that de-
pend on travel or tourism like the arts, 
live events, hotels, and restaurants are 
still hurting. We must understand the 
full impact of the pandemic on travel 
and tourism so that we can help these 
industries to be able to build back bet-
ter. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I en-
courage my colleagues to vote for this 
bill. I think it is a good bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge bipartisan support for this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3752. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
MR. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

TITLE III—DIGITAL TOKEN TAXONOMY 
SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Digital 
Taxonomy Act’’. 
SEC. 302. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) it is important that the United States 
remains a leader in innovation; 
(2) digital tokens and blockchain tech-
nology are driving innovation and providing 
consumers with increased choice and conven-
ience;

sponsible for protecting consumers from un-
fair or deceptive acts or practices, including 
relating to digital tokens; 
(5) the Commission has previously taken 
action against unscrupulous companies and 
individuals that committed unfair or decep-
tive acts or practices involving digital to-
kens; and 
(6) to bolster the Commission’s ability to 
enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices involving digital tokens, the Com-
mission should ensure staff have appropriate 
training and resources to identify and pursue 
such cases. 
SEC. 303. REPORTS ON UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE 
ACTS 
OR 
PRACTICES 
IN 
TRANS-
ACTIONS RELATING TO DIGITAL TO-
KENS. 
Not later than one year after the date of 
enactment of this Act and each year there-
after until fiscal year 2024, the Federal Trade 
Commission shall transmit to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation 
of the Senate, and make publicly available 
on its website, a report of— 
(1) any actions taken by the Commission 
relating to unfair or deceptive acts or prac-
tices in transactions relating to digital to-
kens; 
(2) the Commission’s other efforts to pre-
vent unfair or deceptive acts or practices re-
lating to digital tokens; and 
(3) any recommendations by the Commis-
sion for legislation that would improve the 
ability of the Commission and other relevant 
Federal agencies— 
(A) to further protect consumers from un-
fair or deceptive acts or practices in the dig-
ital token marketplace; and 
(B) to promote competition and promote 
innovation in the global digital token sector. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3723. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 3723, the Consumer Safety 
Technology Act, and I want to begin by 
thanking Representatives MCNERNEY 
and BURGESS for their leadership on 
this bill, which they reintroduced this 
Congress. 
This legislation will help modernize 
our consumer protection agencies and 
encourage the use of advanced tech-
nologies, like artificial intelligence 
and blockchain in support of product 
safety and consumer protection. 
These technologies can help the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission and 
the Federal Trade Commission improve 
their operations and more effectively 
carry out their mission. 
Technological 
advances 
and 
globalization have greatly expanded 
the range of consumer products on the 
market. And as consumers shop online, 
more and more of these products are 
being shipped directly to homes. Artifi-
cial intelligence could help the CPSC 
oversee the increasingly complex range 
of products under its jurisdiction by 
helping to identify new injury trends 
and emerging hazards. 
AI can also help the CPSC monitor 
online marketplaces for the illegal sale 
of recalled products. The persistence of 
recalled products on online third-party 
marketplaces is a particularly per-
nicious problem that puts Americans 
needlessly at risk. 
For example, months after the dan-
gerous Fisher-Price Rock ‘n Play and 
other infant inclined sleepers were re-
called, a Consumer Reports investiga-
tion found that these products were 
still being sold on sites like Facebook 
Marketplace 
and 
Craigslist, 
even 
though they had been linked to dozens 
of infant fatalities. I am hopeful that 
artificial intelligence can be harnessed 
here to help eradicate the illegal sale 
of recalled products on online market-
places. 
The CPSC could also use AI to assess 
the risks of the growing number of im-
ported consumer products entering our 
country and being sent directly to con-
sumers. 
This bill incorporates a bill origi-
nally introduced by Representative 
SOTO and GUTHRIE, the Blockchain In-
novation Act, and a bill originally in-
troduced by Representatives DAVIDSON 
and SOTO, the Digital Taxonomy Act. 
As incorporated in this legislation, 
these bills will help identify ways 
blockchain technology can be used to 
further support consumer protection. 
It will also make sure that scammers 
and fraudsters don’t get ahead of con-
sumers and law enforcement in the 
realm of blockchain and digital tokens. 
Mr. Speaker, finally, I thank Rank-
ing Member RODGERS
and Consumer 
Protection 
and 
Commerce 
Sub-
committee Ranking Member BILIRAKIS 
for working with us to move this bill; 
and as always, to the chairwoman of 
the subcommittee, the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues 
to support this measure, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3723, the Consumer Safety 
Technology Act. 
I thank Representatives BURGESS, 
MCNERNEY, GUTHRIE, SOTO, and DAVID-
SON for their leadership on this effort 
and, of course, our chairman and our 
ranking member, and our ranking 
member on the subcommittee, as well 
as the chairman of the subcommittee. 
Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan bill di-
rects the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission to conduct a pilot program 
to determine how artificial intelligence 
may be used to advance the agency’s 
product safety mission. 
Given the agency’s broad jurisdiction 
over so many consumer products, effi-
ciently and accurately analyzing data 
in the marketplace is critical to its ef-
fective operation. 
This bill also includes an important 
study of how blockchain technology 
may be used to prevent fraud, increase 
privacy, and bolster our Nation’s sup-
ply chain. This is complementary to 
the American COMPETE Act that also 
prioritizes this emerging technology to 
ensure America leads in the technology 
and in its development. 
Furthermore, H.R. 3723 also focuses 
on digital tokens, which are seeing in-
creased adoption by consumers. The 
bill targets ways in which we can pro-
tect consumers from fraud in the dig-
ital token marketplace, a dangerous 
trend that has recently become more 
apparent. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for their important work on this par-
ticular piece of legislation, and I urge 
all my colleagues to support this bill. 
b 1445 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCNERNEY), who is the 
prime sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding and 
for recognizing this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my legislation, H.R. 3723, the Con-
sumer Safety Technology Act. 
H.R. 3723 will encourage the use of 
emerging technologies, specifically ar-
tificial intelligence and blockchains, to 
help keep consumers safe. It will aid 
our consumer protection agencies with 
carrying out their missions. 
H.R. 3723 incorporates the AI for Con-
sumer Product Safety Act legislation 
that I authored with Representative 
BURGESS. These provisions direct the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission, 
CPSC, to establish a pilot program for 
the agency to use AI in furtherance of 
the agency’s work to protect con-
sumers from unsafe products. 
For example, the CPSC could use ar-
tificial intelligence to more quickly 
and efficiently identify consumer prod-
uct hazards, such as exploding laptops 
that have faulty batteries, defective 
USB chargers, furniture that tips over, 
and unsafe infant sleeping products. 
Being able to identify these hazards 
more quickly will enable the CPSC to

help also recall products more quickly 
and, in turn, help save lives. 
We have heard firsthand from CPSC 
commissioners when they testified be-
fore the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee that artificial intelligence 
can benefit the agency’s work in serv-
ing the American people. 
I am pleased that last year my legis-
lation, the AI in Government Act, was 
enacted into law. Among other things, 
the AI in Government Act establishes 
an AI Center of Excellence to facilitate 
adoption of AI technology in the Fed-
eral Government. This will provide a 
central resource within the govern-
ment to aid agencies with AI adoption 
and help agencies share best practices. 
But it is also critical that agencies 
build up their capacity internally to 
adopt AI technology. H.R. 3723 will em-
power the CPSC to do just that. The 
CPSC’s experience here will also serve 
as an example for other agencies that 
are looking to integrate AI in further-
ance of their agency’s missions. 
H.R. 
3723 
also 
incorporates 
the 
Blockchain Innovation Act introduced 
by Representative SOTO and GUTHRIE. 
These provisions will help ensure that 
we use the benefits of blockchain tech-
nology to help stop scams and fraud. 
Additionally, H.R. 3723 incorporates 
the Digital Taxonomy Act from Rep-
resentatives SOTO and DAVIDSON. These 
provisions 
will 
help 
ensure 
the 
scammers and fraudsters don’t get 
ahead of consumers and law enforce-
ment in the realm of blockchain and 
digital tokens. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives 
BURGESS, SOTO, GUTHRIE, and DAVIDSON 
for their work in H.R. 3723, and Chair-
man PALLONE
and Ranking Member 
RODGERS for helping to move this im-
portant bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BURGESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the legislation with Rep-
resentative MCNERNEY, H.R. 3723, the 
Consumer Safety Technology Act. 
You know, over my time in the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee, I have 
made several trips out to the CPSC and 
observed firsthand how the men and 
women dedicate their lives to ensuring 
that consumers have safe products, 
that consumers have products that are 
not going to cause harm to the user. 
And as we approach the anniversary 
of our Nation’s independence on July 4, 
I also have a lot of respect for these 
same individuals who ensure that our 
fireworks that are sold at the commer-
cial stands at the side of the road also 
meet certain specifications. 
So as we approach Independence Day, 
it is always a good time to acknowl-
edge the work done by the men and 
women in the Consumer Product Safe-
ty Commission. 
The bill we are talking about today 
actually passed the last Congress by a 
voice vote, but it did fail to advance in 
the United States Senate. It includes 
the bill that Mr. MCNERNEY and I in-
troduced, the Artificial Intelligence for 
Consumer Product Safety legislation, 
along 
with, 
as 
referenced, 
the 
Blockchain Innovation Act and the 
Digital Taxonomy Act. 
We are once again considering this 
bill because this is commonsense legis-
lation that should be signed into law to 
improve and modernize our consumer 
protection agencies. 
The Consumer Product Safety Com-
mission has jurisdiction over 15,000 
consumer products. Many of these are 
purchased online without the consumer 
reviewing or assessing the product in 
person. Throughout the time of the 
pandemic, Americans have sought to 
fulfill their needs through online shop-
ping, and many companies and small 
businesses have innovated products to 
further increase convenience of daily 
life. The pool of products available to 
consumers is continually expanding, 
putting further strain on the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission to ensure 
the safety of those products. 
While technological advances are in-
creasing the number of types of prod-
ucts available for consumption, the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission 
can employ advanced technology to as-
sist in that mission. 
This bill directs the Consumer Safety 
Product Commission to establish a 
pilot program to use artificial intel-
ligence for tracking injury trends, 
identifying consumer product hazards, 
monitoring the retail marketplace for 
the sale of recalled products, or identi-
fying unsafe imported consumer prod-
ucts. 
It is safe to say that when the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission was 
created, no one anticipated the sheer 
volume of material that would be being 
imported, for which they now have re-
sponsibility. 
Artifical intelligence uses algorithms 
to quickly automate human functions 
and to filter and analyze data. Artifi-
cial intelligence is already advancing 
capabilities in multiple sectors to bet-
ter serve consumers by increasing ca-
pacity and enhancing outcomes. As ar-
tificial intelligence advances, it should 
be capable of helping predict fail rates 
and identifying problems in consumer 
products before they can significantly 
impact the market. 
If we want the United States to stay 
ahead of China and other global com-
petitors, we must advance and utilize 
artificial intelligence in all appropriate 
products and processes. I can think of 
no better place to implement these ca-
pabilities than in the protection of 
products used every single day by 
American consumers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge colleagues to 
support this bill. Again, it passed the 
last Congress in a voice vote. We 
should advance it today. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SOTO), another sponsor of the bill 
from the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman PALLONE, Chairwoman SCHA-
KOWSKY, 
Representative 
MCNERNEY, 
Ranking Member RODGERS, Ranking 
Member BILIRAKIS, and Representative 
GUTHRIE for bringing forward these key 
bills on technology. 
Emerging technologies like artificial 
intelligence, blockchain technologies, 
and cryptocurrency are playing a grow-
ing importance in our daily lives and 
are going to be an economic driver for 
the 21st century economy. 
Blockchain, in essence, is a fixed 
ledger. Once you add data or a trans-
action, it cannot be changed. There-
fore, it makes the data have integrity 
and makes sure that, as we are doing 
transactions and adding data over the 
internet, it can’t be changed and that 
there is certainty to it. That is why it 
is so critical. 
Then once we add AI to analyze this 
fixed data, we could help solve some of 
the largest problems that we face as a 
nation: healthcare, climate change, to 
be two examples; the delivery of per-
sonal protection equipment during a 
pandemic. 
And, of course, cryptocurrency al-
lows for small businesses, in particular, 
to provide services across the world 
without the transaction costs of ex-
changing currencies. It will help with 
remittances and other ways that we 
can modernize our economy. 
It is essential that the United States 
continue to be a global leader in these 
emerging technologies to ensure our 
democratic values remain at the fore-
front of this technological develop-
ment. 
Authoritarian 
regimes 
like 
China and Russia are investing heavily 
in these areas. It is absolutely critical 
for the free world to invest and to win 
the future in these areas. 
Also, as a responsible global leader, 
the United States must strike the ap-
propriate balance of providing an envi-
ronment that fosters innovation while 
ensuring appropriate consumer protec-
tion. 
That is why I am proud to work with 
Representative MCNERNEY on H.R. 3723. 
It includes parts of the Digital Tax-
onomy Act and all of the Blockchain 
Innovation Act. As many of you know, 
blockchain technology will be helpful 
in the ways we discussed already. 
First, H.R. 3639, the Blockchain Inno-
vation Act, directs the Department of 
Commerce, in consultation with the 
FCC, to conduct a study and submit to 
Congress a report on the state of 
blockchain technology in commerce, 
including its use to reduce fraud and 
increase security. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
GUTHRIE for cosponsoring and co-intro-
ducing this bill. This is a first step to-
ward a long-term goal of setting up a 
Blockchain Center of Excellence in the 
Department of Commerce. 
In addition, the Digital Taxonomy 
Act requires a similar report from the 
FCC to report recommendations on de-
ceptive practices, and the relationship 
between the FTC, FCC, and the CFTC.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2947 
June 22, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
DAVIDSON for his cosponsorship. 
When we look at market volatility, 
the 
use 
of 
cryptocurrency 
for 
ransomware in recent attacks like the 
Colonial Pipeline and tax evasion, it is 
critical that we get in on the front end 
of this. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to work 
with Representative MCNERNEY, and I 
urge support for H.R. 3723. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO), an important mem-
ber of the Energy and Commerce full 
committee and also the subcommittee. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS) for yielding to me. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3723, the Consumer Safety Technology 
Act. 
This is important legislation that 
helps the U.S. solidify its position as a 
world leader in technology and innova-
tion while protecting our constituents. 
This legislation builds on the Amer-
ican COMPETE Act, which sought to 
remove burdensome regulatory barriers 
to promote American innovation and 
consider how safely using artificial in-
telligence can transform the future. 
This is also a critical step in main-
taining our global competitive edge in 
emerging technologies over foreign ad-
versaries like China. It will make us 
less reliant on these bad actors for im-
portant technologies. 
The Consumer Safety and Tech-
nology Act establishes a pilot program 
to explore how to safely use artificial 
intelligence to protect consumers from 
unsafe products while advancing cut-
ting-edge American innovation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to gentlewoman from Illinois 
(Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), the chairwoman of 
the subcommittee. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the authors of this bipartisan 
legislation, 
Representatives 
MCNER-
NEY, BURGESS, SOTO, GUTHRIE, and DA-
VIDSON. 
Mr. Speaker, the Federal Govern-
ment should put the incredible techno-
logical innovation of the last few years 
to work for the American people, and 
that is exactly what this bill does. It 
promotes the use of artificial intel-
ligence in product safety and studies 
how blockchain can protect consumers. 
b 1500 
Regulators will be stronger and the 
American consumer safer when we con-
sider how these technologies can help 
them achieve this mission. 
Part of the mission of the Federal 
Trade Commission is to protect con-
sumers from unfair and deceptive busi-
ness practices. It is important to keep 
track of any such practices in the dig-
ital token ecosystem where unscrupu-
lous businesspeople may be seeking to 
take advantage of the vast wealth cre-
ated by digital tokens. This bill directs 
the Federal Trade Commission to re-
port on its work keeping users of the 
digital token system safe. 
Emerging technologies pose both per-
ils and promise. That is why we must 
direct Federal agencies to make sure 
that consumers are safe. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no other speakers. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a very important 
bill. We have to get it past the finish 
line this time. I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge support for this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3723. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

SAFE SLEEP FOR BABIES ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3182) to provide that inclined 
sleepers for infants and crib bumpers 
shall be considered banned hazardous 
products under section 8 of the Con-
sumer Product Safety Act, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3182 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safe Sleep 
for Babies Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. BANNING OF INCLINED SLEEPERS FOR 
INFANTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, in-
clined sleepers for infants, regardless of the

banned hazardous product under section 8 of 
the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 
2057). 
(b) INCLINED
SLEEPER
FOR
INFANTS
DE-
FINED.—In this section, the term ‘‘inclined 
sleeper for infants’’ means a product with an 
inclined sleep surface greater than ten de-
grees that is intended, marketed, or designed 
to provide sleeping accommodations for an 
infant up to 1 year old. 
SEC. 3. BANNING OF CRIB BUMPERS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, crib 
bumpers, regardless of the date of manufac-
ture, shall be considered a banned hazardous 
product under section 8 of the Consumer 
Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2057). 
(b) CRIB BUMPER DEFINED.—In this section, 
the term ‘‘crib bumper’’— 
(1) means any material that is intended to 
cover the sides of a crib to prevent injury to 
any crib occupant from impacts against the 
side of a crib or to prevent partial or com-
plete access to any openings in the sides of a 
crib to prevent a crib occupant from getting 
any part of the body entrapped in any open-
ing; 
(2) includes a padded crib bumper, a sup-
ported and unsupported vinyl bumper guard, 
and vertical crib slat covers; and 
(3) does not include a non-padded mesh crib 
liner. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3182. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 3182, the Safe Sleep for Ba-
bies Act. 
This important piece of legislation 
was reintroduced this Congress by Vice 
Chair CA´ RDENAS and Chair SCHAKOWSKY 
of our Consumer Protection and Com-
merce Subcommittee. 
Parents and caregivers deserve the 
peace of mind that any infant sleep 
product they buy is consistent with 
longstanding safe sleep recommenda-
tions that babies should only sleep on 
their backs on a firm, flat surface free 
of extra bedding. 
This legislation would ban two very 
dangerous products for babies that defy 
safe sleep best practices and have trag-
ically taken far too many infant lives: 
inclined sleepers and crib bumpers. To 
date, inclined sleepers have been linked 
to at least 94 infant fatalities, and crib 
bumpers have contributed to at least 
107 deaths. 
Inclined sleepers position babies on a 
dangerous incline that can lead to the 
baby’s airway becoming obstructed, 
among other hazard patterns. Crib 
bumpers 
create 
unnecessary 
suffo-
cation, entrapment, and strangulation 
risks for babies. 
There is simply no reason either of 
these products should still be on the 
market. Yet, incline sleepers and crib 
bumpers are heavily marketed and re-
main widely available online and on 
store shelves. Many parents, grand-
parents, and caregivers continue to 
purchase these products, wholly un-
aware of the grave risks they pose to 
babies. 
Since April 2019, when Consumer Re-
ports first reported on the deadly toll 
of infant inclined products, an inde-
pendent expert hired by the CPSC has 
confirmed that all sleep products with 
inclines greater than 10 degrees pose 
serious dangers to infants.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2948 
June 22, 2021 
Earlier this month, CPSC approved a 
strong, new Federal safety standard on 
infant sleep products that will effec-
tively prohibit infant inclined sleepers. 
However, the new safety standard will 
not take effect for some time, and 
there is still no Federal standard to 
eliminate the hazard posed by crib 
bumpers. 
That is why this bill is necessary. 
H.R. 3182 bans crib bumpers along with 
inclined sleepers, and it will take effect 
6 months after the date of enactment, 
making sure strong protections for ba-
bies are not needlessly delayed. 
We must take action on this bill 
today, Mr. Speaker, to protect babies 
across the Nation. I call on my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3182, the Safe Sleep for Babies Act. I 
thank Mr. CA´ RDENAS and, of course, 
Chair SCHAKOWSKY for their hard work 
on this bill. 
H.R. 3182 addresses the risk of dan-
gers that infants face from inclined 
sleepers and crib bumpers. This bill 
bans all products with an inclined sleep 
surface greater than 10 degrees to ad-
dress the tragic deaths related to in-
clined sleepers and any crib bumpers 
intended to cover the sides of a crib or 
that prevent access to openings on the 
sides of the crib. 
I am always ready to work with my 
colleagues on the Energy and Com-
merce 
Committee 
to 
help 
protect 
Americans from potentially harmful 
products. That is the reason I re-
quested this subcommittee. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this particular measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY), who is the chair of the sub-
committee and one of the major spon-
sors of the bill. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. PALLONE and my ranking 
member because this is such an impor-
tant bipartisan bill that is designed to 
save lives. 
My colleague, TONY CA´ RDENAS, and I 
introduced the Safe Sleep for Babies 
Act after the release of several dev-
astating reports linking inclined sleep 
products and crib bumpers to infant 
deaths. This urgently needed legisla-
tion will add these dangerous products 
to the list of banned hazardous prod-
ucts under the Consumer Product Safe-
ty Act. 
The science is clear: The safest sleep 
environment for babies is a flat, firm, 
bare surface with no restraints or soft 
bedding. Infant inclined sleep products 
and crib bumpers are dangerous and 
should not be on the market at all. 
If we do not pass this legislation, 
companies will continue to sell and 
market these products that can harm 
and even kill infants, and infants will 
continue to be harmed if we don’t act 
now. As a mother and grandmother, I 
know that we must act now to ensure 
that no more babies die from unsafe 
sleep products. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan bill. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me rise with a great deal of concern 
and, as well, righteousness and enthu-
siasm to support the Safe Sleep for Ba-
bies Act of 2021. 
Our children are our most precious 
resource, and no one knows how to ad-
dress parents who have had a child lose 
their life because of devices that were 
sold to them to comfort their babies. 
The Safe Sleep for Babies Act of 2021, 
in particular, is going to help to take 
those products off that heretofore have 
gone without discovery, without as-
sessment, and without penalty. They 
are devices that are in cribs and bassi-
nets that have not been assessed to 
cause death. 
Babies have been losing their lives to 
frightened parents, shocked parents, 
caretakers, and grandparents. What a 
tragedy to lose that infant in the early 
part of their life through no fault of 
the caretaker, the parent, and, cer-
tainly, that baby. 
This legislation, I hope, will find its 
way quickly through the United States 
Senate and as well find its way quickly 
to the President’s desk. 
As a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, we have, frighteningly, seen 
over the past weeks and months the 
loss of life of children through gun vio-
lence. We have a responsibility from 
the very birth of a child, from its time 
to come to be with its loving family, to 
find a way to protect and preserve its 
life. Babies, again, are enormously pre-
cious. 
I think this legislation is long over-
due. I ask my colleagues to support the 
Safe Sleep for Babies Act of 2021. I am 
glad to join the Energy and Commerce 
Committee and its original sponsor, 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS, to be able to, hopefully, 
move this bill as quickly as possible. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
very important bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
ask for support of the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3182. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

STOP TIP-OVERS OF UNSTABLE, 
RISKY DRESSERS ON YOUTH ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1314) to require the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission to promul-
gate a consumer product safety rule for 
free-standing clothing storage units to 
protect children from tip-over related 
death or injury, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1314 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop Tip- 
overs of Unstable, Risky Dressers on Youth 
Act’’ or the ‘‘STURDY Act’’. 
SEC. 2. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY STANDARD 
TO PROTECT AGAINST TIP-OVER OF 
CLOTHING STORAGE UNITS. 
(a) CLOTHING STORAGE UNIT DEFINED.—In 
this section, the term ‘‘clothing storage 
unit’’ means any free-standing furniture 
item manufactured in the United States or 
imported for use in the United States that is 
intended for the storage of clothing, typical 
of bedroom furniture. 
(b) CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY STANDARD 
REQUIRED.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in sub-
section (c)(1), not later than 1 year after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission shall— 
(A) in consultation with representatives of 
consumer groups, clothing storage unit man-
ufacturers, craft or handmade furniture 
manufacturers, and independent child prod-
uct engineers and experts, examine and as-
sess the effectiveness of any voluntary con-
sumer product safety standards for clothing 
storage units; and 
(B) in accordance with section 553 of title 
5, United States Code, promulgate a final 
consumer product safety standard for cloth-
ing storage units to protect children from 
tip-over-related death or injury that in-
cludes— 
(i) tests that simulate the weight of chil-
dren up to 60 pounds; 
(ii) objective, repeatable, and measurable 
tests that simulate real world use and ac-
count for any impact on clothing storage 
unit stability that may result from place-
ment on carpeted surfaces, drawers with 
items in them, multiple open drawers, or dy-
namic force; 
(iii) testing of all clothing storage units, 
including those under 30 inches in height; 
and 
(iv) warning requirements based on ASTM 
F2057–17, or its successor at the time of en-
actment, provided that the Consumer Prod-
uct Safety Commission shall strengthen the 
requirements of ASTM F2057–17, or its suc-
cessor, if reasonably necessary to protect 
children from tip-over-related death or in-
jury. 
(2) TREATMENT OF STANDARD.—A consumer 
product safety standard promulgated under 
paragraph (1) shall be treated as a consumer 
product safety rule promulgated under sec-
tion 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act 
(15 U.S.C. 2058).

(c) SUBSEQUENT RULEMAKING.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—At any time subsequent to 
the publication of a consumer product safety 
standard under subsection (b)(1), the Com-
mission may initiate a rulemaking, in ac-
cordance with section 553 of title 5, United 
States Code, to modify the requirements of 
the consumer product safety standard de-
scribed in subsection (b)(1) if reasonably nec-
essary to protect children from tip-over-re-
lated death or injury. 
(2) REVISION OF RULE.—If, after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention revises its 
Clinical Growth Charts, the consumer prod-
uct safety standard described in subsection 
(b)(1) shall, on the date that is 180 days after 
such revision, be revised to include tests 
that simulate the weight of children up to 
the 95th percentile weight of children 72 
months in age, as depicted in the revised 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
Clinical Growth Charts, unless the Commis-
sion determines the modification is not rea-
sonably necessary to protect children from 
tip-over-related death or injury. 
(3) TREATMENT
OF
RULES.—Any rule pro-
mulgated under paragraph (1) or revision 
made pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be 
treated as a consumer product safety rule 
promulgated under section 9 of the Consumer 
Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on H.R. 1314. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 1314, the STURDY Act. I 
want to begin by thanking Consumer 
Protection 
and 
Commerce 
Sub-
committee 
Chair 
SCHAKOWSKY
for 
championing and reintroducing this 
critical piece of legislation, which will 
help protect children from deadly fur-
niture tip-overs. 
Tip-overs remain one of the top five 
hidden hazards in the home. According 
to new data from the Consumer Prod-
uct Safety Commission, between 2000 
and 2019, tip-over incidents have been 
linked to more than 450 child fatalities 
and tens of thousands more injuries. 
Every 46 minutes a child is injured in 
a tip-over incident. The victims tend to 
be young children who are curious and 
creative, eager to climb and play 
make-believe with the world around 
them. But dressers pose a deadly dan-
ger, and their crushing weight can lead 
to tragedy in just minutes. 
These incidents often happen si-
lently, too. Parents who have lost chil-
dren from furniture tip-overs report 
never hearing the dresser falling be-
cause the child’s body had absorbed the 
brunt of the impact or a child was 
pinned in such a way that he or she 
couldn’t even scream or cry out. 
The current voluntary furniture sta-
bility standards are woefully inad-
equate and have not stopped children 
from dying from unstable dressers. In 
March, Consumer Reports reported on 
two tip-over incidents, including one 
death that happened within 1 week of 
each other, highlighting the ongoing 
and urgent need for this lifesaving leg-
islation. 
b 1515 
Our children deserve a strong, man-
datory standard that keeps them safe 
from such a common household danger. 
Right 
now, 
the 
current 
voluntary 
standard only applies to dressers 30 
inches or taller, despite multiple fa-
talities and injuries involving shorter 
dressers. 
Also, the voluntary testing doesn’t 
incorporate the upper weight range for 
children affected by tip-overs. It also 
ignores real-world dynamics, such as 
the movement of drawers and different 
flooring surfaces that a dresser might 
be resting on. 
The STURDY Act would finally es-
tablish a strong mandatory furniture 
stability safety standard and protect 
children from being crushed under the 
weight of their bedroom furniture. This 
legislation will save lives, and that is 
why I call on my colleagues to support 
this measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill directs the 
Consumer Products Safety Commission 
to issue a consumer product safety 
standard for clothing storage units to 
protect children from tip-over related 
injuries, as the chairman stated. 
The CPSC has recognized this as one 
of the top five potential hidden hazards 
in the home, with an average of one 
child fatality every 2 weeks from fall-
ing furniture and appliances. It is good 
to restate it because people need to 
know. 
We support this bill moving forward 
with House passage today. I thank the 
chairwoman of the subcommittee, my 
colleague, Ms. SCHAKOWSKY, for cham-
pioning 
this 
bill; 
along 
with 
Mr. 
CA´ RDENAS and all of the members of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
for their efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 1314, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY), the chairwoman of the sub-
committee and sponsor of this bill. I 
am sure many have noticed today that 
many of these bills that protect con-
sumers, particularly children, have 
been championed by Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. PALLONE for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, since 2000, more than 
460 children have died from furniture 
tip-overs, and the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission has reported that 
tip-overs cause an average of 25,500 
emergency room-treated injuries every 
year as children are crushed, trapped, 
or stuck by furniture. 
These deaths and injuries should 
never have happened in the first place, 
but they continue to happen because 
current furniture stability standards 
are both inadequate and only vol-
untary. We can’t continue to allow the 
furniture industry to regulate itself. It 
hasn’t worked and it has come at a 
cost of children’s lives. 
That is why I have reintroduced the 
legislation, the STURDY Act, H.R. 
1314, which would strengthen and make 
mandatory 
furniture 
stabilization 
standards for clothing storage units. 
No parent should have to worry 
about their children being injured, or 
worse, by a piece of furniture. 
I want to give a special shout-out to 
the organization Kids In Danger that 
has been advocating for this for a long 
time, and for the moms who came to 
this Congress and told the stories of 
their lost children because of these tip- 
overs. Their stories have moved every-
one who has heard them. 
It is time now that we act. We can do 
something to help prevent these fur-
niture tip-overs that put our Nation’s 
children in danger. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. 
BILIRAKIS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Chairwoman SCHAKOWSKY
for 
championing this very important bill. 
The best ideas come from the people, 
from our constituents. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
bill swiftly, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary Committee and 
the founder and Co-Chair of the Congres-
sional Children’s Caucus, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 1314, the ‘‘Stop Tip-Overs of Un-
stable, Risky Dressers on Children Act,’’ or 
‘‘STURDY Act,’’ which directs the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission to adopt a strong-
er, mandatory stability standard for clothing 
storage units within one year of enactment, 
following the streamlined rulemaking process 
that it has used for numerous children’s prod-
ucts. 
A tip-over can involve a piece of furniture, 
often a dresser or other type of clothing stor-
age unit, falling onto a small child. 
These dangerous episodes can lead to a 
trip to the emergency room, or even death. 
A child is sent to the emergency room be-
cause of a tip-over incident every 60 minutes, 
and on average, 1 to 2 children die every 
month. 
Children age 2 to 5 are at the highest risk— 
their motor abilities allow them to navigate the 
home by themselves and their intellectual de-
velopment makes them curious about objects 
that might be out of reach. 
In June 2016, IKEA recalled 29 million 
dressers and chests due to a tipover hazard;

June 22, 2021 
at least 8 children died in tragic tip-over acci-
dents and hundreds of children have been in-
jured by IKEA furniture. 
Mr. Speaker, relying upon a voluntary stand-
ard for dressers is not enough to protect our 
children from tip-overs. 
The voluntary standard only tests whether a 
dresser or drawer will tip with 50 lbs. hanging 
from an open drawer. 
This standard has not proven stringent 
enough to reduce tip-overs, and it also only 
applies to dressers over 27 inches. 
Even as weak as it is, dressers do not have 
to meet this voluntary standard. 
That is why the STURDY Act is needed; it 
will help prevent the deaths of children from 
tip-overs.

and 
5. Requires the CPSC to issue the manda-
tory standard within 1 year of the STURDY 
Act’s enactment. 
I strongly support H.R. 1314, the Stop Tip-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on 
H.R. 3841. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, American Indian and 
Alaska Native communities experience 
disproportionately worse health out-
comes than other groups in the United 
States. The root causes of these poor 
health outcomes are complex, but, un-
fortunately, not surprising. For cen-
turies, American Indian and Alaska 
Native communities have been dis-
placed and damaged by violence, pov-
erty, disease, and adverse social condi-
tions. As a result, Tribal members live 
shorter lives than any other demo-
graphic group. 
Unfortunately, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has also devastated Tribal com-
munities. According to data from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, American Indians and Alaska 
Natives are at greater risk of COVID–19 
infection and more than three times 
more likely to be hospitalized. 
Moreover, there are significant gaps 
in data collection and the full picture 
of the disease burden is really un-
known. So it is important for us to im-
prove Tribal health data collection ef-
forts so that we can improve health 
outcomes. Tribal Epidemiology Centers 
manage regional public health infor-
mation systems and disease prevention 
and control services. These centers also 
collaborate with other public health 
authorities to study, collect, and ana-
lyze epidemiological data. 
Clear communication and coordina-
tion by Federal, State, and local public 
health departments is necessary to the 
success and security of these efforts. 
So the bill before us, H.R. 3841, the 
Tribal Health Data Improvement Act, 
equips Tribal communities with en-
hanced resources to collect public 
health data and adapt public health 
programs to improve health outcomes. 
The bill clarifies the Federal Govern-
ment’s role in the collection and dis-
tribution of public health and disease 
surveillance data. It does this by cre-
ating a strategy to share information 
with the Indian Health Service, Indian 
Tribes and organizations, and Tribal 
Epidemiology Centers. 
The legislation requires the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to release all applicable public health 
data to Tribal entities within 180 days 
of enactment. 
It also requires the CDC to encourage 
and enhance collaborative efforts be-
tween States and Tribal organizations 
to synergize data collection. 
Finally, the bill reauthorizes the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics 
with an additional $185 million in fund-
ing to implement the programs estab-
lished by the legislation. 
I thank Representatives MULLIN and 
O’HALLERAN for their bipartisan efforts 
to bringing this bill forward. They are 
always champions for the Tribes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3841, the Tribal Health Data 
Improvement Act of 2021, introduced by 
my Energy and Commerce colleagues, 
Representatives 
MULLIN
and 
O’HALLERAN. 
This important public health bill ad-
dresses the chronic challenges faced by 
Tribal Nations and Tribal Epidemi-
ology Centers in gaining access to crit-
ical healthcare and public health sur-
veillance data. 
Obtaining this data is necessary for 
engaging in preventative public health 
work and combating the current health 
crises in American Indian and Alaska 
Native communities. 
Structural barriers to accessing data 
have been especially problematic dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic, which has 
disproportionately 
impacted 
these 
communities. In order to ensure that 
Tribal Nations and Tribal Epidemi-
ology Centers have access to the data 
necessary to accomplish public health 
priorities, the bill requires that the 
Secretary of HHS create a data-sharing 
strategy that takes into consideration 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Sec-
retary’s Tribal Advisory Committee. 
In addition, in reauthorizing the 
CDC’s National Center for Health Sta-
tistics, the bill requires the Secretary 
to make public health surveillance 
data available to the Indian Health 
Service, Indian Tribes, the Tribal orga-
nizations, and Tribal Epidemiology 
Centers so long as the data requested 
for use is consistent with Federal law 
and obligations. 
The Secretary must also consult with 
Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, 
urban Indian organizations, and the 
Tribal Technical Advisory Group of the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services to develop guidelines for State 
and local health agencies to improve 
the quality and accuracy of birth and 
death records of American Indians and 
Alaska Natives. 
It makes a lot of sense. By improving 
the sharing of data between the Fed-
eral Government and the Tribes, this

Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, on all of 
these good bills that are being debated 
with strong bipartisan support on the 
Democratic side and the Republican 
side when they go to a voice vote, Mr. 
Speaker, does there need to be even one 
‘‘no’’ vote, which there have not been 
for this whole series, for a Member to 
ask for a recorded vote? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has not stated a proper point of 
order, but the Chair would inform 
Members that the gentleman from 
Montana requested the yeas and nays, 
and pursuant to section 3(s) of House 
Resolution 8, the yeas and nays have

PREVENTING CRIMES AGAINST

(H.R. 983) to amend title 18, United 
States Code, to provide an additional 
tool to prevent certain frauds against

The text of the bill is as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

the 
Preventing 
Crimes 
Against Veterans Act of 2021, bipar-
tisan legislation that would make it a 
crime to knowingly engage in any 
scheme to defraud a veteran of his or 
her veteran’s benefits. 
Our Nation owes a great debt to vet-
erans. There are currently about 18 
million veterans of the United States 
military, men and women who self-
lessly served our Nation. 
Unfortunately, many of our veterans, 
as a result of their service, have phys-
ical and mental scars. There are well 
over 1 million American veterans with 
service-connected disabilities, and 43 
percent of post-9/11 veterans have a 
service-connected disability which may 
entitle them to certain benefits. 
Receipt of benefits requires the vet-
eran to file an application and undergo 
a thorough review by the Department 
of Veterans Affairs. Sometimes these 
benefits are granted outright. Other 
times, the veteran must appeal their 
initial denial to receive the benefits 
they deserve. 
Under current law, the VA allows 
agents or attorneys to assess a nominal 
fee to assist claimants who are appeal-
ing different aspects of their benefits. 
They are not permitted, however, to 
charge for services related to the ini-
tial preparation and filing of their 
claims. 
Accordingly, it is currently illegal 
for a nonattorney or a person not reg-
istered as an agent to assist such ini-
tial claims. The rationale for this pro-
hibition is that many veterans may fall 
victim to benefit fraud schemes, where 
individuals may divert benefits or 
apply for benefits that should not be 
awarded. 
To enforce this prohibition, Federal 
prosecutors currently rely on the wire 
and mail fraud statutes to ensure that 
nonattorneys or nonregistered agents 
do not assist in benefit applications or 
unlawfully divert benefits. 
However, if an unauthorized indi-
vidual offers a veteran assistance in 
person, they cannot be prosecuted 
under current fraud statutes. The wire 
and mail fraud statutes do not extend 
to in-person fraudulent schemes. 
The Preventing Crimes Against Vet-
erans Act would close this critical 
loophole and would ensure that in-per-
son benefit fraud schemes may also be 
prosecuted. 
For example, in one instance, a 
scammer held briefing seminars in a 
senior community. He asked the staff 
to round up the veterans, then used 
high-pressure sales tactics to coerce 
the veterans to apply for benefits. 
In-person solicitation like this re-
quires no electronic or mail trans-
mission and, thus, evades wire and 
mail fraud criminal prohibitions. Other 
reports indicate that scammers have 
also been known to hand out flyers 
outside of VA regional medical centers 
and VA regional offices to identify un-
witting veterans. 
These examples are precisely why 
closing this loophole is so critically 
important. Under H.R. 983, anyone con-
victed of such crimes could be fined, 
imprisoned, or be subject to both pen-
alties. 
By adopting this bill, Congress would 
affirm the integrity of the benefits pro-
gram and would protect veterans and 
their survivors who receive payments, 
such as those to veterans with service- 
connected disabilities, pensions for vet-
erans with limited incomes, and edu-
cation and training payments under 
the GI bill. 
In recognition of the extreme sac-
rifice by our veterans and the hard-
ships many of them continue to face 
after their military service, it is our 
duty to provide, to the best of our abil-
ity, an appropriate measure of com-
pensation for them, particularly for 
those who are in need. 
This legislation would ensure that 
attempts to defraud them of the bene-
fits they need and deserve may be fully 
prosecuted. 
I commend the bill’s sponsors, Mr. 
DEUTCH and Mr. FITZPATRICK, for their 
hard work and bipartisan efforts to ad-
dress this critical problem. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2953 
June 22, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today 
makes a small but significant change 
to the Federal fraud statutes to protect 
veterans from criminals who seek to 
steal their benefits. It does so by in-
serting a new provision into the crimi-
nal code to complement the mail and 
wire fraud statutes. 
Unfortunately, there have been re-
ports in recent years of criminals en-
tering nursing homes in search of el-
derly veterans with the intent to de-
fraud them of their Federal benefits. 
Like many crimes of fraud, these 
fraudsters present themselves to their 
victims as a helping hand in a time of 
need. This is a truly despicable crime 
worthy of this body’s attention. 
This 
legislation 
has 
passed 
this 
House three times by overwhelming 
margins, including a vote of 417–0 last 
Congress. 
Our men and women in uniform have 
sacrificed much for us. They have 
earned our gratitude, our respect, and 
our protection. 
Mr. Speaker, there is little, in my 
mind, more contemptuous than some-
one who tries to defraud a veteran of 
what they have earned in defense of 
our country. We must put an end to 
this fraud. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
this measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DEUTCH). 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 983, the Preventing 
Crimes Against Veterans Act. 
Financial fraud is an increasingly so-
phisticated enterprise. The unfortunate 
reality is that our Nation’s veterans 
have become one of its biggest new tar-
gets. 
Far 
too 
often, 
so-called 
pension 
poachers prey on elderly veterans. 
They use high-pressure sales pitches to 
con vulnerable veterans, survivors, and 
their families out of their hard-earned 
and well-deserved benefits. 
Scammers make big promises, know-
ing that they will never be able to de-
liver. In the end, they leave veterans 
with their personal information and fi-
nancial security compromised. 
These criminals not only prey on our 
veterans, they prey on every American 
taxpayer who wants to do right by 
those who have served our country. 
Sadly, the COVID–19 pandemic has 
only made the situation worse, as 
scams have been on the rise. 
The VA, community groups, and vet-
erans service organizations are work-
ing to alert and educate our commu-
nities about these scams. But Congress 
must ensure that we do not let pension 
poachers get away with taking advan-
tage of those who have served. 
Unfortunately, our current laws fail 
to keep up with the increasing com-
plexity of these fraudulent schemes. 
This bill will give Federal prosecu-
tors the tools they need to target 
criminals who actively work to avoid 
current mail and wire fraud statutes. It 
will specifically outlaw attempts to de-
fraud veterans of their benefits. 
It is past time that we take action to 
crack down on pension poachers and 
other fraudsters who prey on our vet-
erans. 
I want to thank the Palm Beach 
County Veterans Services office includ-
ing, Greg Dover, Jose Capellan, Rohn 
Hultgren, Andrew Reese, and Yolanda 
Asante. They are working hard to help 
veterans receive their benefits, and 
they first raised the troubling rise of 
pension poaching with me years ago. 
I thank Congressman FITZPATRICK for 
his leadership on this important bipar-
tisan effort. Again, I want to thank Mr. 
NADLER and the gentleman from North 
Carolina, and I am thankful to every 
Member of this body who voted to pass 
this legislation last Congress 417–0. 
I would, again, ask my colleagues to 
support and honor our veterans by 
passing the Preventing Crimes Against 
Veterans Act. Our veterans have done 
so much to protect this Nation. It is 
now our turn, and this bill is an oppor-
tunity for us to help protect them. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
am proud to lend my voice in support 
of H.R. 983, the Preventing Crimes 
Against Veterans Act, and I congratu-
late the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
DEUTCH) for his work, again, on an 
enormously commonsense bill. 
This is a commonsense and needed bi-
partisan fix to close a loophole in Fed-
eral law that allows con artists who 
make in-person pitches to defraud vet-
erans of their well-earned benefits. 
The State of Texas is home to 1.5 
million veterans, and the State of 
Texas operates a large network of nurs-
ing homes for veterans. 
All of us have heard stories in our of-
fices, 
through 
our 
veterans’ 
case-
worker, of the horrible, horrible at-
tacks on veterans because of the bene-
fits they receive. Yes, financial at-
tacks. And they are attacks. Unlike 
the battlefield, where they can defend 
themselves, these attacks, they can-
not. 
Veterans at these homes and vet-
erans seeking treatment at medical 
treatment facilities may be susceptible 
to the in-person grifters falsely claim-
ing that they can facilitate the provi-
sions of additional veterans’ benefits. 
This bill would help hold scammers 
accountable and allow the Department 
of Justice to protect the integrity of 
veterans’ 
benefits 
programs. 
Pro-
tecting veterans and their survivors 
from these types of in-person scams is 
particularly important, since so many 
depend on service-connected disability 
payments. 
As chair of the Crime, Terrorism, and 
Homeland Security Subcommittee, I 
am focused on addressing fraud and 
other veterans’ issues. 
To that end, I ask my colleagues 
today to join me as I also work on leg-
islation to buttress veterans’ courts 
and to make them a more equitable 
and successful rehabilitation model. 
I thank my colleague from the Judi-
ciary Committee, TED
DEUTCH, for 
championing this bill and persisting in 
his effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to lend my voice

able and allow the Department of Justice to

grams. Protecting veterans and their survivors 
from these types of in-person scams is par-
ticularly important since so many depend on 
service-connected disability payments. 
As Chair of the Crime, Terrorism, and 
Homeland Security Subcommittee, I am fo-
cused on addressing fraud and other veterans’ 
issues. 
To that end, I ask my colleagues here today 
to join me as I also work on legislation to but-
tress veterans’ courts and to make them more 
equitable and successful rehabilitation models. 
I thank my colleague on the Judiciary Com-
mittee, Representative TED DEUTCH, for cham-
pioning this bill and persisting in this effort. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for clos-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, Congress owes a con-
tinuing debt to veterans. This bill 
would help protect the more than 1 
million veterans diagnosed with serv-
ice-connected disabilities who receive 
related benefits, as well as the thou-
sands who are undiagnosed and may 
apply for such benefits in the future. 
Helping to ensure that their benefits 
are protected against fraud, as H.R. 983 
would do, is one way of expressing our 
appreciation for veterans’ service. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary Committee and 
the Chair of its Subcommittee on Crime, Ter-
rorism, and Homeland Security, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 983, the ‘‘Preventing Crimes 
Against Veterans Act,’’ commonsense and 
necessary bipartisan legislation that estab-
lishes a new criminal offense for knowingly en-
gaging in or attempting to engage in a scheme 
to defraud veterans of their hard-earned bene-
fits. 
My state of Texas is home to nearly 1.5 mil-
lion veterans, and the state operates a large 
network of nursing homes for veterans called 
Texas State Veterans Homes. 
Houston houses over 282,000 of these vet-
erans, many of whom live in these state- 
owned nursing homes. 
Veterans at these Texas nursing homes or 
those seeking treatment at medical facilities 
are susceptible to in-person scammers falsely 
claiming that they can facilitate the provision 
of additional veterans benefits when they are 
actually swindling veterans out of their bene-
fits. 
H.R. 983 will help hold these con artists ac-
countable and provide an additional tool to the 
Department of Justice to protect the integrity 
of veterans’ benefits programs and prevent 
fraud. 
Protecting veterans and their survivors from 
these types of in-person scams is imperative 
since so many depend on service-connected 
disability payments, including those in my dis-
trict in Houston. 
I ask my colleagues here today to join me 
as I also work on legislation to strengthen vet-
erans’ courts and to make them more equi-
table and successful rehabilitation models. 
I thank my colleague from the Judiciary 
Committee, Congressman DEUTCH of Florida, 
for championing this bill and persisting in his 
effort to protect our veterans with this legisla-
tion. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 983, the Preventing Crimes Against 
Veterans Act of 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 983, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

CRIMINAL JUDICIAL 
ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2694) to amend title 18, United 
States Code, to provide for transpor-
tation and subsistence for criminal jus-
tice defendants, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2694 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

ment motions in that case, including but not 
limited to petitions for writs of habeas cor-
pus, writs of coram nobis, motions to vacate 
a sentence under section 2255 of title 28, and 
motions related to mental competency under 
chapter 313 of this title.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2694. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2694, the Criminal 
Judicial Administration Act of 2021, is 
bipartisan legislation that makes two 
modest but important amendments to 
current law, promoting efficient, effec-
tive, and fair administration of justice. 
The first part of this bill concerns 
out-of-custody 
criminal 
defendants, 
particularly those who are released 
pending trial to live in communities 
that are located far from the court-
houses where their cases are being 
heard. 
Most Federal criminal defendants are 
detained pending trial. The U.S. Mar-
shals Service is responsible for housing 
and transporting them to court hear-
ings, including trial. Under current 
law, the court may order the marshals 
to provide funds for a criminal defend-
ant who is released pending trial but 
cannot afford the cost of travel to the 
location of the courthouse for required 
court proceedings. 
However, defendants must fund their 
own way back home, and defendants in 
this position are not able to receive fi-
nancial support from the marshals for 
subsistence, such as lodging and meals. 
For an indigent defendant, these costs 
are sometimes insurmountable. 
For years, Federal courts have strug-
gled with how to assist indigent de-
fendants when they find themselves in 
these 
difficult 
situations. 
Unfortu-
nately, the courts’ efforts have come 
up against the text of the statute. 
This bill would authorize courts, in 
the interest of justice, to order the 
U.S. marshals to cover roundtrip travel 
and subsistence for defendants who 
must attend court hearings but who 
cannot afford to pay this on their own. 
The Judicial Conference of the United 
States has urged us to correct this 
grave unfairness, and I am pleased to 
see that we are finally doing so with 
this bill. 
The second part of this bill, con-
cerning Federal magistrate judges, is

also supported by the Judicial Con-
ference. Magistrate judges have trial 
jurisdiction 
over 
certain 
mis-
demeanors, except for Class A mis-
demeanors, for which the maximum 
sentence is up to 1 year in custody. 
With a defendant’s consent, however, a 
magistrate judge may exercise trial ju-
risdiction over a case involving a Class 
A misdemeanor. Magistrate judges fre-
quently do so and often hear Class A 
misdemeanor cases all the way through 
judgment and sentencing. 
b 1545 
Under current law, a magistrate 
judge’s jurisdiction ends after judg-
ment is entered in a misdemeanor case, 
and post-judgment jurisdiction reverts 
to the district court. Indeed, mag-
istrate judges are not authorized to 
hear post-judgment motions, such as 
motions to vacate a sentence, even 
though they are the ones who handled 
the entire matter at the trial level and 
are best equipped to hear such post- 
judgment motions. 
Among other things, this bill would 
authorize a magistrate judge to hear 
post-judgment 
motions 
in 
mis-
demeanor cases in which he or she ex-
ercised trial jurisdiction. This amend-
ment clearly improves judicial econ-
omy and makes perfect sense. 
This is a straightforward and bipar-
tisan measure that will help our crimi-
nal justice system operate in a more 
effective and fair manner. I thank Mr. 
JEFFRIES and Mr. ROY for sponsoring 
this legislation, and I urge all Members 
to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2694, the Criminal Judicial Administra-
tion Act of 2021. 
This bill strengthens existing laws 
that provide for the transportation and 
subsistence for indigent criminal de-
fendants when they are brought to 
court proceedings. 
H.R. 2694 also allows a magistrate 
judge to finally decide post-judgment 
motions in a misdemeanor case where 
that magistrate judge was the judge 
who handled the underlying case. 
This provision will improve the effi-
ciency of our court system by allowing 
our courts to manage caseloads in a 
more economical manner. 
I thank the bipartisan sponsors of 
this legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 2694, the Crimi-
nal Judicial Administration Act of 
2021. 
This legislation reflects another step 
in our ongoing work commitment to 
ensure that justice is administered 
fairly and equally in this country. 
The first part of the bill relates to 
our Federal pretrial system. I thank 
Mr. NADLER, our chairman; and, of 
course, the author of this bill, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES). 
As we work on changes to our pre-
trial system, we must also make cer-
tain that indigent defendants who are 
released on bail pending trial, who live 
far away from the courthouse in which 
they must appear, can make it to the 
court for required appearances. 
As the chair of the Crime, Terrorism, 
and Homeland Security Subcommittee, 
it is our committee that deals with the 
criminal justice system and the system 
that should be fair to victim and al-
leged perpetrator. That means that in-
dividuals who are defendants and are 
indigent must be able to get to the 
courthouse in order to assure a fair jus-
tice system. 
For out-of-custody defendants, the fi-
nancial and emotional toll of making 
required court appearances is consider-
able. It can mean taking time off from 
sorely needed jobs, sometimes without 
compensation, or shifting scarce house-
hold resources to make it to court on 
time and to avoid rearrest for failure 
to appear. 
These challenges are heightened for 
defendants who have cases pending in 
districts that are far from where they 
live. This distance can also lead to un-
necessary pretrial detention, as courts 
wrestle with how to ensure that de-
fendants who live out of their districts 
can make required court appearances. 
This is a commonsense legislative ini-
tiative. 
H.R. 2694 gives courts the ability to 
direct the U.S. marshals to provide for 
roundtrip travel and subsistence for in-
digent defendants or those who cannot 
otherwise afford those costs to attend 
court during the pendency of their 
cases. 
This is an important step in our work 
on Federal pretrial reform, and, as I 
said, common sense in fairness of the 
system. 
The second part of the bill promotes 
judicial economy by allowing mag-
istrate judges to oversee the entirety 
of the cases in which they exercised 
trial jurisdiction. This administrative 
step is important for our overburdened 
Federal judiciary and our efforts to 
fairly administer justice to all individ-
uals. That is certainly the responsi-
bility of those of us on the House Judi-
ciary Committee. 
I thank Representative JEFFRIES for 
his work on this bill, which I encourage 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2694, 
the Criminal Judicial Administration Act of 
2021. This legislation reflects another step in 
our ongoing work and commitment to ensure 
that justice is administered fairly and equally in 
this country. 
The first part of the bill relates to our federal 
pretrial system. 
As we work on changes to our pretrial sys-
tem, we must also make certain that indigent 
defendants who are released on bail pending 
trial—but live far away from the courthouse in 
which they must appear—can make it to court 
for required appearances. 
For out-of-custody defendants, the financial 
and emotional toll of making required court ap-
pearances is considerable. It can mean miss-
ing time off from sorely needed jobs, some-
times without compensation, or shifting scarce 
household resources to make it to court on 
time and to avoid re-arrest for failure to ap-
pear. 
These challenges are heightened for de-
fendants who have cases pending in districts 
that are far from where they live. This distance 
can also lead to unnecessary pretrial deten-
tion, as courts wrestle with how to ensure that 
defendants who live out of their districts can 
make required court appearances. 
H.R. 2694 gives courts the ability to direct 
the U.S. Marshals to provide for roundtrip trav-
el and subsistence for indigent defendants—or 
those who cannot otherwise afford these 
costs—to attend court during the pendency of 
their cases. This is an important step in our 
work on federal pretrial reform. 
The second part of the bill promotes judicial 
economy by allowing magistrate judges to 
oversee the entirety of the cases in which they 
exercise trial jurisdiction. This administrative 
step is important for our overburdened federal 
judiciary, and our efforts to fairly administer 
justice to all individuals. 
I thank Representative JEFFRIES for his work 
on this bill, which I encourage my colleagues 
to join me in supporting today. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to im-
prove the administration of justice 
through our court system by sup-
porting this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
NADLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
Criminal Judicial Administration Act 
of 2021 would make several critical 
changes to improve the operation of 
our Federal criminal justice system. 
I commend Representatives HAKEEM 
JEFFRIES and CHIP ROY for introducing 
the legislation, as well as their bipar-
tisan cosponsors for their leadership in 
bringing these important issues to our 
attention. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this bipartisan bill 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 2694, the Criminal Judicial Ad-
ministration Act of 2021. This legislation re-
flects another step in our ongoing work and 
commitment to ensure that justice is adminis-
tered fairly and equally in this country. 
The first part of the bill relates to our federal 
pretrial system. 
As we work on changes to our pretrial sys-
tem, we must also make certain that indigent 
defendants who are released on bail pending 
trial—but live far away from the courthouse in 
which they must appear—can make it to court 
for required appearances. 
For out-of-custody defendants, the financial 
and emotional toll of making required court ap-
pearances is considerable. It can mean miss-
ing time off from sorely needed jobs, some-
times without compensation, or shifting scarce

household resources to make it to court on 
time and to avoid re-arrest for failure to ap-
pear. 
These challenges are heightened for de-
fendants who have cases pending in districts 
that are far from where they live. This distance 
can also lead to unnecessary pretrial deten-
tion, as courts wrestle with how to ensure that 
defendants who live out of their districts can 
make required court appearances. 
H.R. 2694 gives courts the ability to direct 
the U.S. Marshals to provide for roundtrip trav-
el and subsistence for indigent defendants—or 
those who cannot otherwise afford these 
costs—to attend court during the pendency of 
their cases. This is an important step in our 
work on federal pretrial reform. 
The second part of the bill promotes judicial 
economy by allowing magistrate judges to 
oversee the entirety of the cases in which they 
exercise trial jurisdiction. This administrative 
step is important for our overburdened federal 
judiciary, and our efforts to fairly administer 
justice to all individuals. 
I thank Representative JEFFRIES for his work 
on this bill, which I encourage my colleagues 
to join me in supporting today. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, everyone—re-
gardless of their financial situation—should be 
able to fully and fairly defend themselves in 
court. 
Unfortunately, however, many defendants 
who live very far away from the court trying 
their case cannot afford to get to and from 
their court appearances to defend themselves. 
The costs can be simply insurmountable. 
This situation often makes poverty the dif-
ference between winning and losing a case, 
regardless of the facts. 
That is not justice. 
This bill helps make courtroom justice avail-
able to everyone by ensuring that travel and 
lodging costs are covered for low-income de-
fendants. 
This will help ensure justice for all defend-
ants, not just those wealthy enough to afford 
it. 
This bill also makes courtrooms more effec-
tive. It allows magistrate judges to rule on cer-
tain post-judgment issues that they previously 
could not adjudicate on cases that they han-
dled at the trial level. 
This is common sense. If a case has been 
with a judge through the entirety of the trial, 
that judge knows the case best and should be 
able to handle post-conviction issues. 
As a former litigator, I believe this bill will 
help ensure that justice prevails and make our 
overburdened court system more efficient, and 
I thank Congressman JEFFRIES for introducing 
this important legislation.

ELDER ABUSE PROTECTION ACT 
OF 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2922) to amend the Elder Abuse 
Prevention and Prosecution Act to au-
thorize the Elder Justice Initiative, to 
require that online resources of such 
initiative are made available in Span-
ish, and for other purposes, as amend-
ed. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2922 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Elder Abuse 
Protection Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. ELDER JUSTICE INITIATIVE. 
Section 101(b) of the Elder Abuse Prevention 
and Prosecution Act (34 U.S.C. 21711(b)) is 
amended to read as follows: 
‘‘(b) ELDER JUSTICE INITIATIVE.— 
‘‘(1) PERMANENT

safety, medical personnel, mental health per-
sonnel, financial services personnel, and any 
other individuals whose work may bring them in 
contact with elder abuse regarding how to— 
‘‘(i) conduct investigations in elder abuse 
cases; 
‘‘(ii) address evidentiary issues and other 
legal issues; and 
‘‘(iii) appropriately assess, respond to, and 
interact with victims and witnesses in elder 
abuse cases, including in administrative, civil,

‘‘(A) Spanish-language resources and links 
that help report instances of elder fraud and 
abuse to State and local law enforcement; and 
‘‘(B) resources that help prevent financial ex-
ploitation of elders.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on H.R. 2922. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 2922, the bipartisan Elder Abuse 
Protection Act of 2021. 
This bill would make permanent the 
Department of Justice’s Elder Justice 
Initiative and would assign the initia-
tive a number of critical responsibil-
ities that would protect vulnerable sen-
iors from fraud and abuse. 
The bill includes critical elder abuse 
preventive measures, including an obli-
gation to post elder abuse prevention 
resources online, to coordinate with 
the Office of Tribal Justice to address 
elder fraud on reservations, and to pub-
lish Spanish-language elder fraud and 
abuse materials. Additionally, the bill 
would authorize the Department’s op-
eration of the National Elder Fraud 
Hotline. 
These changes are a testament to the 
importance this Congress places on 
elder justice and its continued commit-
ment to address emerging elder fraud 
issues. 
Sadly, tens of thousands of elderly 
Americans are abused and exploited 
every day. By one estimate, American 
seniors lose at least $2.9 billion each 
year due to financial abuse and exploi-
tation. The U.S. Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau similarly estimates 
that elder Americans suffer an average 
annual loss of $34,200 due to fraud. 
Tragically, instances of elder fraud 
and abuse have only gone up. From 2013 
to 2017, financial scams and other 
crimes 
targeting 
older 
Americans 
quadrupled. Elderly individuals are 
vulnerable to abuse on account of a 
myriad of factors, with social isolation 
and mental impairment, such as de-
mentia or Alzheimer’s disease, playing 
outsized roles.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2957 
June 22, 2021 
By making permanent and expanding 
the Elder Justice Initiative’s mandate, 
the Department of Justice can more ef-
fectively protect our Nation’s seniors 
and prosecute instances of elder abuse. 
At a time when seniors are perhaps at 
their most vulnerable, it only makes 
sense that the government redouble its 
efforts to protect America’s seniors. 
It is particularly important that 
marginalized elder communities get 
the educational and preventive re-
sources they need. The Elder Abuse 
Protection Act does exactly that by re-
quiring that the Elder Justice Initia-
tive coordinate with the Office of Trib-
al Justice on how to address elder 
abuse on reservations. This provision 
would mean fewer elder indigenous 
Americans will fall victim to exploi-
tation. 
The bill also makes permanent the 
elder abuse fraud hotline. With the hot-
line, concerned Americans can report 
instances of elder abuse directly to the 
Department of Justice, and victims can 
obtain support and resources that they 
need. 
The Elder Abuse Protection Act also 
requires that the Elder Justice Initia-
tive share their materials online and in 
Spanish. More Americans will have ac-
cess to the DOJ’s resources. Greater 
access to those materials is critical so 
that older Latinos, who comprise al-
most 4 million individuals, can also ac-
cess these crucial resources. 
In short, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2922 re-
doubles the government’s commitment 
to preventing elder fraud and abuse, 
and to ensuring that seniors have ac-
cess to the resources they need. 
I thank Representatives GARCIA and 
SPARTZ, the sponsors of this bipartisan 
legislation, for their vision and their 
leadership on this important issue. 
I strongly support this legislation, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it 
as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2922. 
The Elder Abuse Protection Act 
builds on President Trump’s strong 
record of protecting America’s seniors 
and responding to elder abuse in Amer-
ica. In 2017, President Trump signed 
into law the Elder Abuse Prevention 
and Prosecution Act to improve the 
justice system’s response to victims of 
elder abuse and exploitation cases. 
In 2018, President Trump signed an 
executive order that established a task 
force within the Justice Department 
that placed a new emphasis on the 
growing problems of cyber fraud and 
fraud targeting the elderly. Attorney 
General Barr appointed a National 
Elder Justice Coordinator to oversee 
the Department’s work to combat elder 
fraud. 
Because of the Trump administra-
tion’s work, all 94 U.S. Attorney’s of-
fices now have a prosecutor dedicated 
to focus on the most pressing elder jus-
tice issues in each jurisdiction. 
The Department also established an 
Elder Justice Initiative to support and 
coordinate the Department’s enforce-
ment and programmatic efforts to 
combat elder abuse, neglect, and finan-
cial fraud cases and scams that target 
our seniors. 
This bill codifies the Trump adminis-
tration’s Elder Justice Initiative as a 
program within the Department of Jus-
tice. President Trump and his adminis-
tration led on protecting American 
seniors. The bill before us today will 
make permanent the thoughtful and 
successful initiatives implemented by 
President Trump and Attorney General 
Barr. 
I am pleased that my colleagues 
across the aisle recognize the leader-
ship of President Trump and Attorney 
General Barr in these important areas. 
I thank the sponsor and cosponsor of 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the bipartisan 
Elder Abuse Protection Act. 
I proudly sponsored this legislation 
because, quite frankly, back in the day, 
when I was a geriatric social worker, I 
saw 
firsthand 
the 
abuse 
targeted 
against our seniors as consumers. 
This bill will help ensure that our 
seniors today, the group that most dis-
proportionately 
was 
impacted 
by 
COVID–19, are not continuing as tar-
gets of fraudulent crimes. I thank Rep-
resentative SPARTZ for joining me in 
this legislation. 
This March, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation’s Internet Crime Com-
plaint Center released its 2020 internet 
crime report, noting it received 105,301 
complaints—over 100,000 complaints— 
from victims over the age of 60. 
That was a whopping 54 percent in-
crease from the 2019 numbers of 68,000 
complaints. If you look at the cost and 
value of these complaints, it was $966 
million, an approximate 15 percent in-
crease from the 2019 number of $835 
million. 
What is worse, Mr. Speaker, is that 
these statistics reflect only those com-
plaints in which the victim voluntarily 
provided their age range as over 60. So 
there may be even more. 
Victims over the age of 60 are tar-
geted by perpetrators because they are 
believed to have significant reliable fi-
nancial resources. 
The evidence is clear, as the United 
States ages, diversifies, and modern-
izes, the number of older adults experi-
encing elder abuse is, unfortunately, 
also projected to increase. 
Elder abuse assessment measures and 
interventions are critical. This inter-
vention 
is 
even 
more 
urgent 
for 
Latinos in our country who lack access 
to resources and information in their 
preferred language. 
In 2017, the United States Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services es-
timated that the Latino population in 
the United States age 65 and over was 
over 4 million people. By 2060, the De-
partment projects the population of el-
derly Latinos in America to grow to 
19.9 million, or 21 percent of the overall 
American elderly population. That is a 
huge number and growing. 
Given these rapid growth rates and 
projected increases, public online re-
sources should be made available to 
Americans with limited English pro-
ficiency. Providing Spanish language 
resources to the public will therefore 
reach an underserved population and 
will provide an important resource to 
millions of residents in the United 
States of America, especially to my 
home State of Texas.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MCNERNEY). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Ms. 
GARCIA 
of 
Texas. 
Unfortu-
nately, due to the quarantine measures 
and limitations on visiting facilities 
and nursing homes, it has made it easi-
er for abuse, neglect, and fraud to go 
undetected. 
That is why this important legisla-
tion makes permanent a National 
Elder Fraud Hotline and requires the 
Elder Justice Coordinator to consult 
with the Office of Tribal Justice and 
designees on legal aid issues. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from In-
diana (Mrs. SPARTZ). 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2922, the Elder 
Abuse Protection Act. 
As we have seen through the recent 
pandemic, American seniors are among 
the most vulnerable population. As a 
former State senator, I dealt with 
many issues our elderly Hoosiers are 
facing in their lives. 
The 
Trump 
administration 
made 
great strides in achieving justice for el-
derly Americans victimized by fraud 
and abuse. By standing up the Elder 
Justice Initiative, the administration 
charged nearly 1,000 defendants with 
fraud totaling over $2.2 billion. 
The Elder Abuse Protection Act 
makes permanent this initiative, which 
will continue its important work under 
this bill to ensure criminals are held 
accountable. 
This legislation is a very important 
step in the right direction to protect 
and take care of the people who used to 
care for us. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
SYLVIA GARCIA, for leading this critical 
effort, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this good legislation. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2958 
June 22, 2021 
thank the ranking member for his pres-
entation and the gentlewoman for her 
presentation. 
I am proud to support H.R. 2922, the 
Elder Abuse Protection Act, which has 
been supported by my colleague from 
Texas, the Honorable SYLVIA GARCIA. 
As Chairman NADLER said and de-
tailed, the sheer number of elder abuse 
cases is astounding and shameful, and 
the pandemic has only worsened the 
economic and emotional circumstances 
that so many seniors face. 
This problem is particularly grave 
for linguistic minority groups. My 
hometown of Houston has a large His-
panic community, and I am particu-
larly concerned with efforts to exploit 
my elder Spanish-speaking constitu-
ents. 
In Texas, 20 percent of Hispanics are 
65 years or older. One study of this pop-
ulation found that limited English pro-
ficiency was a barrier to accessing 
medical and social services. 
That is why the thoughtful legisla-
tion offered by Congresswoman GARCIA 
is so very important, and its time is 
now. 
I am an enthusiastic supporter of 
this bill because it would make perma-
nent the Elder Justice Initiative in the 
Department of Justice and require it to 
translate into Spanish those resources 
the initiative makes available to the 
public. The cost of translating those 
educational materials is small com-
pared to the benefit they would bring. 
It would be a modest undertaking for 
the Department of Justice, given that 
DOJ already has litigation translation 
services in place. 
Lastly, this bill makes permanent 
the National Elder Fraud Hotline— 
very important. Since March 2020, the 
hotline has answered tens of thousands 
of calls from elder Americans who have 
called in need of support, offering a 
service to get information on how to 
prevent elder fraud for the many elder 
Americans who don’t have access to 
the internet. 
We all know the most vulnerable. 
These elders who have worked to build 
this country deserve to live their sen-
ior years in peace and tranquility and 
with respect and dignity. They do not 
deserve to be taken advantage of by 
fraudulent 
individuals, 
fraudulent 
schemes, and fraudulent practices. If 
we can do anything to help them, we 
should do it. 
This legislation strongly helps them, 
and I commend Ms. GARCIA for cham-
pioning this issue. I urge my colleagues 
to join me in voting in favor of this 
much-needed legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 
2922, the ‘‘Elder Abuse Protection Act.’’ 
As Chairman NADLER detailed, the sheer 
number of elder abuse cases is astounding 
and shameful, and the pandemic has only 
worsened the economic and emotional cir-
cumstances that so many seniors face. 
This problem is particularly grave for lin-
guistic-minority groups. 
My hometown of Houston has a large His-
panic community, and I am particularly con-
cerned with efforts to exploit my elder Span-
ish-speaking constituents. 
In Texas, 20 percent of Hispanics are 65 
years old or older. One study of this popu-
lation found that limited English proficiency 
was a barrier to accessing medical and social 
services. 
I am an enthusiastic supporter of this bill be-
cause it would make permanent the Elder Jus-
tice Initiative in the Department of Justice, and 
require it translate into Spanish those re-
sources the initiative makes available to the 
public. 
The cost of translating these educational 
materials is small compared to the benefit they 
would bring. It would be a modest undertaking 
for the Department of Justice, given that DOJ 
already has litigation translation services in 
place. 
Lastly, this bill makes permanent the Na-
tional Elder Fraud Hotline. 
Since March 2020, the hotline has an-
swered tens of thousands of calls from elder 
Americans who have called in need of sup-
port, offering a service to get information on 
how to prevent elder fraud for the many elder 
Americans don’t have access to the internet. 
I commend Ms. GARCIA for championing this 
issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting in favor of this much-needed legislation. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this very 
worthy bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to support H.R. 2922, the ‘‘Elder Abuse 
Protection Act.’’ 
As Chairman NADLER detailed, the sheer 
number of elder abuse cases is astounding 
and shameful, and the pandemic has only

net. 
I commend Ms. GARCIA for championing this 
issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting in favor of this much-needed legislation. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, reports esti-
mate that as many as 1 in 10 elders are 
abused every year, but less than half of these 
incidents are actually reported, and the COVID 
pandemic has left seniors isolated and more 
vulnerable to fraud and abuse. 
All over, we are seeing scammers deceive 
a grandparent that their grandchild is in trou-
ble and needs money. 
We see imposters pose as IRS agents to 
trick an elder into paying money they do not 
owe. 
We see fraudsters offer tech support assist-
ance and collect money for fraudulent serv-
ices. 
We must hold these criminals accountable 
for taking advantage of and abusing our sen-
iors. 
Protecting and caring for our loved ones— 
who once supported and cared for us—is one 
of our most honorable responsibilities. 
The Elder Abuse and Protection Act pro-
motes justice for vulnerable seniors by making 
the Elder Justice Initiative a permanent office 
within the Department of Justice, which works 
to combat elder abuse, neglect, and financial 
fraud and scams that target our nation’s sen-
iors. 
I thank Congresswoman GARCIA for intro-
ducing this important legislation to protect our 
seniors, and I am proud to be a cosponsor 
and support it today.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from

tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on H.R. 961. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 961, the Justice for Juveniles 
Act. 
This bipartisan bill would eliminate 
the administrative exhaustion require-
ment for incarcerated youth before 
they may file a lawsuit challenging the 
conditions of their incarceration. 
By passing this bill today, the House 
would correct the manifest wrong cur-
rently present in Federal law and 
would continue bipartisan efforts to 
support incarcerated youth. 
This bill recognizes the same conclu-
sion that has been embraced by the Su-
preme Court and experts for decades, 
that incarcerated young people have 
different 
cognitive 
abilities 
than 
adults, are less mature, and have a 
higher chance of being assaulted while 
incarcerated. 
In recent years, our Nation has fi-
nally come to the realization that 
youth and adults have fundamentally 
different decisionmaking abilities. The 
Supreme Court has repeatedly cited 
adolescents’ lack of maturity as a rea-
son why they are not as culpable as 
adults for their actions or able to rec-
ognize certain dangers. 
Yet, in current law, there are no al-
lowances for these differences in cog-
nitive abilities when it comes to ad-
dressing deficiencies in conditions of 
confinement. 
Complying with current law, which 
requires an understanding of detailed 
grievance procedures and timelines, is 
nearly impossible for most incarcer-
ated youth. Compliance with grievance 
procedures not only requires an under-
standing of the grievance process but, 
on a more basic level, it requires that 
an incarcerated person be able to read, 
which, sadly, many incarcerated people 
cannot do. 
According to one study, among incar-
cerated youth, 85 percent are function-
ally illiterate, and the baseline reading 
levels vary from grade one to grade six. 
In addition, approximately 70 percent 
of incarcerated juveniles have at least 
one learning disability. 
Youth are, furthermore, less likely 
than adults to recognize as risks the 
circumstances they face in a correc-
tional facility. Youth may not recog-
nize the impending or imminent danger 
of some of the risks they face. 
Compounding these challenges, in-
carcerated youth, as a group, experi-
ence extraordinarily high rates of men-
tal illness. Nearly 50 percent of incar-
cerated 16- to 18-year-olds suffer from a 
mental illness. Juveniles housed with 
adults are 10 times more likely to have 
psychotic episodes, and they have a 
suicide rate that is 7.7 times higher 
than those housed in juvenile facilities. 
In recent years, the public has be-
come more aware of the many dangers 
that lurk in correctional facilities. 
Hurricanes have flooded facilities; cold 
snaps have left prisoners freezing to 
death; and heat waves have killed pris-
oners when they lacked proper ventila-
tion or air conditions. These conditions 
pose a special danger to youth, who do 
not have the ability or experience to 
recognize that they are in immediate 
danger. 
While natural disasters can pose an 
extraordinary risk to youth, prison life 
itself may also pose life-threatening 
dangers. Adolescents incarcerated with 
adults are also more prone to both 
physical and mental abuse. Youth are 
50 percent more likely to be physically 
assaulted when they are housed in 
adult facilities than in juvenile facili-
ties. 
Taken together, most incarcerated 
youth are simply not able to recognize 
or to effectively communicate when 
their prison conditions become dan-
gerous or unconstitutionally deficient. 
There remains little doubt that the 
current process needs to be changed. 
This bill proposes a modest reform to 
the Prison Litigation Reform Act. It 
simply exempts youth in correctional 
facilities from having to comply with 
technical grievance procedures before 
they can go to court to challenge the 
unconstitutional conditions of their 
confinement. While I would like to see 
us do much more to protect incarcer-
ated youth, this bill is a necessary first 
step. 
I thank Ms. SCANLON and Mr. ARM-
STRONG for introducing this bipartisan 
legislation, and I urge all Members to 
support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
961, the Justice for Juveniles Act. This 
bill eliminates some of the administra-
tive hurdles for juvenile prisoners 
seeking relief in Federal court. 
Juvenile offenders often lack the 
knowledge to pursue and exhaust all 
the complex administrative rules and 
grievance procedures in correctional 
facilities. H.R. 961 will address that 
problem by providing juvenile offend-
ers with quicker access to courts when 
they feel they are being abused or mis-
treated. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON). 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to be here today to advance the 
Justice for Juveniles Act. I thank 
Chairman NADLER, Leader HOYER, and 
my 
colleague, 
Congressman 
ARM-
STRONG, for their support and partner-
ship on this effort. 
The Prison Litigation Reform Act, or 
PLRA, was passed in 1996 in an effort 
to decrease so-called frivolous lawsuits 
brought by prisoners. Chief among the 
PLRA’s mandates was a requirement 
that before seeking relief for civil 
rights violations in court, a detained 
person must exhaust administrative 
remedies. 
Whatever the merits of that under-
lying legislation, we now have broad 
bipartisan agreement that the lan-
guage is overbroad in its application to 
juveniles. 
Studies have consistently shown that 
juveniles are both more likely to be 
abused while in detention and less like-
ly to navigate the administrative rem-
edies that bar them from seeking re-
lief. 
For those of us who have kids or who 
have worked with children, it is easy to 
imagine the difficulty a young person 
in detention might have navigating 
complex legal systems necessary to 
raise a complaint. 
Young people in the criminal or juve-
nile justice system are more likely 
than not to be functionally illiterate, 
and science has shown that the brain is 
not fully developed until a person is in 
their mid-twenties. It is one of the 
many 
reasons 
our 
justice 
system 
makes a distinction between juvenile 
and adult offenses. 
That is what we hope to acknowledge 
with the Justice for Juveniles Act by 
exempting juveniles from the require-
ments of the PLRA. 
In addition, the PLRA also limits the 
kind of relief that juveniles might seek 
for civil rights violations while in de-
tention. They cannot seek relief now 
for emotional injuries without physical 
ones as well, but studies show that 
youth are especially prone to psycho-
logical injury and abuse, which they 
often face in detention. 
Finally, the PLRA limits the recov-
ery of attorney’s fees in such cases. 
Again, juveniles are less likely to have

independent resources to fund an attor-
ney, so that makes it harder for young 
people to find an attorney to vindicate 
their rights. 
To those who might question wheth-
er we need to correct the PLRA, I offer 
the story of the Glen Mills Schools, 
which inspired this bill. 
For almost 200 years, youth from 
across the United States were sent to 
Glen Mills when they ran afoul of the 
law. But the school’s bucolic campus 
and renowned athletic teams masked 
serious daily violence inflicted upon 
children placed there. 
An explosive 2019 report by The 
Philadelphia Inquirer revealed years of 
sexual, 
physical, 
and 
psychological 
abuse of the young residents, including 
broken bones, threats of retaliation, 
and sustained physical assaults at the 
hands of staff members. Although the 
stories from Glen Mills are heart-
breaking, they are not unique. 
b 1615 
Reports show that mistreatment of 
young people in juvenile facilities hap-
pens all the time across the country. 
Just this past March, despite the re-
cent example of Glen Mills, children 
were removed from yet another juve-
nile detention facility, just a few miles 
away, after horrifying new allegations 
of abuse. 
This commonsense, bipartisan legis-
lation 
passed 
unanimously on the 
House floor last Congress and has the 
support of over 60 organizations. 
I, again, thank Chairman NADLER 
and the committee members and staff 
who helped advance this bill, and I 
thank the dedicated leadership team 
who brought the bill to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support 
this 
important 
legislation 
again. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the manager and the chairman 
of the full committee, Committee on 
the Judiciary, and to the manager for 
our friends on the other side of the 
aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 961, the Justice for Juveniles 
Act. 
This is very close to my heart as the 
chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee 
on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland 
Security working on these juvenile jus-
tice issues. And this is a necessary and 
important bipartisan bill that will save 
incarcerated young persons’ lives. 
As 
indicated, 
chairing 
the 
sub-
committee, we recently held a hearing 
titled, ‘‘Juvenile Justice Pipeline and 
the Road Back to Integration.’’ I thank 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON) for this very effective 
and important initiative. 
During the hearing, we heard testi-
mony from witness after witness who 
acknowledged the body of scientific re-
search that has been embraced by ex-
perts and the Supreme Court—and that 
I have known and seen over the years 
as we have written legislation—dem-
onstrating that juveniles do not have 
the same cognitive and emotional ma-
turity as adults. 
In fact, there is data that says that 
the brain does not fully mature until 
age 25. This bill makes a good change 
to the Prison Litigation Reform Act to 
take into account that the over-
whelming majority of juveniles cannot 
comply with the law’s complex griev-
ance procedures by themselves. This 
bill is an important bipartisan step to 
ensuring incarcerated juveniles are re-
habilitated and given the best chance 
possible to reintegrate into society. 
Just some statistics that I saw re-
cently when I received a note about a 
graduation of foster children from high 
school, saying about 60 percent of those 
children not having a complete oppor-
tunity in life did not graduate from 
high school. And so these children wind 
up in these facilities. They should not; 
they should have a life. And therefore, 
we should be able—not associating fos-
ter care children with those incarcer-
ated—but we do know the suscepti-
bility to these children and others who 
don’t have a steady hand in their life. 
So this is an important step. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
on the Subcommittee on Crime, Ter-
rorism, and Homeland Security, Rep-
resentative MARY GAY SCANLON, for au-
thoring this bill. 
As I worked on this legislation, it is 
important to note that to deal with a 
grievance system, it requires an under-
standing of the grievance process. But 
on a more basic level, it requires that 
an incarcerated person be able to read. 
According to one study, we know 
that incarcerated youth are function-
ally illiterate in many instances, and 
the baseline reading levels vary from 
grade 1 to 6. That is a plague, if you 
will, on children in our society that 
can have a bright and wonderful life. 
In addition, approximately 70 percent 
of incarcerated juveniles have at least 
one learning disability. And we know 
that 
because 
of 
what 
happens 
in 
schools in the recently changed State 
laws where juveniles have been sent 
from the schoolhouse to juvenile deten-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this alone justifies the changes in the 
bill, which simply allow incarcerated 
juveniles to go directly to court to 
have serious deficiencies in their incar-
ceration, including allegations of as-
sault, corrected. 
As I said, I thank my colleague, Rep-
resentative MARY GAY SCANLON. As I 
work on legislation to achieve more ex-
tensive juvenile justice reform, I sup-
port the passage of this bill—common-
sense, overdue—and ask that my col-
leagues support this as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
961, the ‘‘Justice for Juveniles Act.’’ This is a 
necessary and important bipartisan bill that will 
save incarcerated young people’s lives. 
The Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Secu-
rity Subcommittee, which I chair, recently held 
a hearing titled the ‘‘Juvenile Justice Pipeline 
and the Road Back to Integration.’’ 
During the hearing, we heard testimony 
from witness after witness who acknowledged 
the body of scientific research, that has been 
embraced by experts and the Supreme Court, 
demonstrating that juveniles do not have the 
same cognitive and emotional maturity as 
adults. 
This bill makes a modest change to the 
Prison Litigation Reform Act to take into ac-
count that the overwhelming majority of juve-
niles cannot comply with the law’s complex 
grievance procedures. 
These requirements not only require an un-
derstanding of the grievance process, but on 
a more basic level, require that an incarcer-
ated person be able to read. According to one 
study, among incarcerated youth, 85 percent 
are functionally illiterate, and the ‘‘baseline 
reading levels var[y] from grade 1 to grade 6.’’ 
In addition, approximately 70 percent of in-
carcerated juveniles have at least one learning 
disability. 
This alone justifies the changes in the bill, 
which simply allow incarcerated juveniles to go 
directly to court to have serious deficiencies in 
their incarceration, including allegations of as-
sault, corrected. 
This bill is a small but important bipartisan 
step to ensuring incarcerated juveniles are re-
habilitated and given the best chance possible 
to reintegrate into society. 
I thank my colleague on the Crime Sub-
committee, Representative MARY GAY SCAN-
LON, for authoring this bill. 
As I work on legislation to achieve more ex-
tensive juvenile justice reform, I support pas-
sage of this bill today and ask that my col-
leagues do the same. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I take a moment to 
note my agreement with the gentle-
woman from Texas’ point, that the cog-
nition of juveniles is not fully devel-
oped and that they should not be called 
upon to make unalterable, lifelong de-
cisions under those circumstances. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, our prison systems are 
ideally meant to rehabilitate, but all 
too often, they do exactly the opposite. 
They are frequently home to wide-
spread, horrible abuse, including phys-
ical and sexual violence and unsanitary 
living conditions. 
It is unacceptable to subject any per-
son to such conditions—but, particu-
larly, our youth to this kind of mis-
treatment. Our system makes it in-
credibly difficult for young people to

file a legal complaint with huge bur-
dens imposed if they want to file a law-
suit, and major barriers to legal rep-
resentation. 
Mr. Speaker, I was a public defender 
here in Washington, D.C., at the start 
of my career, and I am certain that 
this is no way to treat children that we 
are trying to rehabilitate and prepare 
for society and prepare for success in 
their communities. 
These circumstances only make it 
more difficult for young people and 
children and, in fact, they keep them 
in abusive and delinquency cycles. 
This legislation, however, will re-
move some of those barriers for incar-
cerated juveniles to take their abusers 
to court and to seek remedies for mis-
treatment by their correctional insti-
tutions. This bill will take us one step 
closer to desperately needed reform in 
our criminal justice system and will 
help to protect our incarcerated youth. 
Mr. Speaker, I really thank and ap-
plaud Congresswoman SCANLON for this 
important and bipartisan legislation, 
and it is my honor to support it today. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my

persons with legal capacity to be sued to ap-
pear as a party or parties in any suit or pro-
ceeding of any nature whatsoever pending in 
said court to assert and defend their inter-
ests, if any, in such suits or proceedings, 
within such period of time prior to judgment 
as the United States Court of Federal Claims 
shall prescribe. If the name and address of 
any such person is known or can be 
ascertained by reasonable diligence, and if 
he resides within the jurisdiction of the 
United States, he shall be summoned to ap-
pear by personal service; but if any such per-
son resides outside of the jurisdiction of the 
United States, or is unknown, or if for any 
other good and sufficient reason appearing to 
the court personal service cannot be had, he 
may be summoned by publication, under 
such rules as the court may adopt, together 
with a copy of the summons mailed by reg-
istered mail to such person’s last known ad-
dress. The United States Court of Federal 
Claims may, upon motion of the Attorney 
General, in any suit or proceeding where 
there may be any number of persons having 
possible interests therein, notify such per-
sons to appear to assert and defend such in-
terests. Upon failure so to appear, any and 
all claims or interests in claims of any such 
person against the United States, in respect 
of the subject matter of such suit or pro-
ceeding, shall forever be barred and the court 
shall have jurisdiction to enter judgment pro 
confesso upon any claim or contingent claim 
asserted on behalf of the United States 
against any person who, having been duly 
served with summons, fails to respond there-
to, to the same extent and with like effect as 
if such person had appeared and had admit-
ted the truth of all allegations made on be-
half of the United States. Upon appearance 
by any person pursuant to any such sum-
mons or notice, the case as to such person 
shall, for all purposes, be treated as if an 
independent proceeding has been instituted 
by such person pursuant to sections 1491,

if such independent proceeding had then been 
consolidated, for purposes of trial and deter-
mination, with the case in respect of which 
the summons or notice was issued, except 
that the United States shall not be heard 
upon any counterclaims, claims for damages 
or other demands whatsoever against such 
person, other than claims and contingent 
claims for the recovery of money hereafter 
paid by the United States in respect of the 
transaction or matter which constitutes the 
subject matter of such case, unless and until 
such person shall assert therein a claim, or 
an interest in a claim, against the United 
States, and the United States Court of Fed-
eral Claims shall have jurisdiction to adju-
dicate, as between any and all adverse claim-
ants, their respective several interests in 
any matter in suit and to award several 
judgments in accordance therewith. 
‘‘(b) The jurisdiction of the United States 
Court of Federal Claims shall not be affected 
by this section except to the extent nec-
essary to give effect to this section, and no 
person shall recover judgment on any claim, 
or on any interest in any claim, in said court

right to assert in said court if this section

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, keeping track of the 
new laws Congress passes every session 
is a formidable challenge, but it is an 
essential part of maintaining the rule 
of law in our country and it is a duty 
we take seriously in the House. 
The body of Federal law is so large 
and complex at this point that it would 
be almost completely unmanageable 
without the United States Code. Cur-
rently consisting of 54 titles, the Code 
compiles the general and permanent 
laws of the United States into coherent 
subject areas. The Code makes our Fed-
eral laws accessible, both to the gov-
ernment officials who work to fairly 
administer them and to the private 
citizens who seek the benefits or relief 
the laws provide them. 
The Code did not appear magically 
out of thin air. Congress created it in 
1926. And since that time, it has been 
painstakingly constructed and updated 
by expert lawyers working under the 
supervision of the House. We all owe a 
great debt to the Office of the Law Re-
vision Counsel, whose attorneys ably 
carry out this statutory mandate ‘‘to 
develop and keep current an official 
and positive codification of the laws of 
the United States,’’ while maintaining 
strict impartiality as to legislative 
policy. 
Pursuant to the law governing their 
work, the Office of the Law Revision 
Counsel has submitted this legislation 
containing amendments related to title 
41, which Congress recently enacted 
into positive law. It contains purely 
technical changes that update the U.S. 
Code to reflect the new status of these 
titles. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to make it very 
clear that this bill does not change the 
meaning or effect of existing laws in 
any way. It is part of an ongoing effort 
to maintain the Code as an authori-
tative, accurate source of Federal law. 
I thank Mr. FITZGERALD for intro-
ducing this important legislation, and I 
urge all Members to support the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3239 introduced by my friend from Wis-
consin, Representative FITZGERALD. 
Public Law 111–350, which was signed 
into law on January 4, 2011, enacted 
title 41 of the United States Code by re-
stating existing laws relating to public 
contracts. H.R. 3239 makes clarifying 
and technical improvements by updat-
ing statutory references to title 41. Ar-
ticle I, Clause 18 of the Constitution 
tasks Congress with making all laws 
necessary and proper for carrying into 
execution its vested powers. 
The clarity of legislation is impera-
tive for the other branches to imple-
ment and the citizen to follow. The Of-
fice of the Law Revision Counsel pre-
pares the titles of the U.S. Code and 
other technical updates to the Code by 
combining enacted laws by the same 
subject matter. 
H.R. 3239 is a product of that effort. 
Providing clarity in the Federal Gov-
ernment public contracting process al-
lows for transparency and lowers po-
tential barriers to entry, which will 
give more businesses the opportunity 
to compete in the bidding process. 
I appreciate the work of OLRC and 
Representative FITZGERALD on this leg-
islation, and I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to pass the bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3239. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
MAKING IMPROVEMENTS IN EN-
ACTMENT OF TITLE 54, UNITED 
STATES CODE, INTO A POSITIVE 
LAW TITLE AND TO IMPROVE 
CODE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3241) to make improvements in 
the enactment of title 54, United 
States Code, into a positive law title 
and to improve the Code, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3241 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on H.R. 3241. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, just like H.R. 3239, this 
bill has been prepared by the Office of 
the Law Revision Counsel, and it 
makes a number of technical changes 
to update title 54 of the United States 
Code while making no substantive 
changes in law. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Ms. BUSH) for introducing this 
legislation, and I urge all Members to 
support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3241, 
introduced 
by 
Representative 
BUSH, which makes technical changes 
to title 54 of the United States Code re-
lating to National Park Service and re-
lated programs. 
Title 54 was enacted by Public Law 
113–287 on December 19, 2014. Laws to 
codify titles of the Code do not create 
new law. They simply restate the many 
laws that Congress has already created 
in a more organized and readable man-
ner. 
After codifying a new title in the 
Code, often other technical corrections 
through the rest of the Code are needed 
to update cross references to that new 
title. This bill does just that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 3241, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3241, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
ARTISTIC RECOGNITION FOR 
TALENTED STUDENTS ACT 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 704) to amend section 708 of title 
17, United States Code, to permit the 
Register of Copyrights to waive fees for 
filing an application for registration of 
a copyright claim in certain cir-
cumstances, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 704 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Artistic 
Recognition for Talented Students Act’’ or 
the ‘‘ARTS Act’’. 
SEC. 2. WAIVER OF FEES FOR WINNERS OF CER-
TAIN COMPETITIONS. 
Section 708 of title 17, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing new subsection: 
‘‘(e)(1) In this subsection, the term ‘cov-
ered competition’ means— 
‘‘(A) an art competition sponsored by the 
Congressional Institute that is open only to 
high school students; and 
‘‘(B) the competition described in section 3 
of H. Res. 77, as adopted by the 113th Con-
gress. 
‘‘(2) With respect to a work that wins a 
covered competition, the Register of Copy-
rights— 
‘‘(A) shall waive the requirement under 
subsection (a)(1) with respect to an applica-
tion for registration of a copyright claim for 
that work if that application is filed not 
later than the last day of the calendar year 
following the year in which the work 
claimed by the application wins the covered 
competition (referred to in this paragraph as 
the ‘covered year’); and 
‘‘(B) may waive the fee described in sub-
paragraph (A) for an application filed after 
the end of the covered year if the fee would

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
704, a bill that would help introduce 
promising young students who have 
won either the Congressional Art Com-
petition or the Congressional App Chal-
lenge to the intellectual property sys-
tem by waiving the fee for those stu-
dents to apply for a copyright registra-
tion for their winning work. 
I applaud Mr. JEFFRIES
for intro-
ducing this bipartisan, bicameral legis-
lation with Ms. MACE, along with their 
bipartisan cosponsors. 
Many of us in this Chamber know 
just how important intellectual prop-
erty rights are to our country and to 
our economy, yet studies show that 
awareness of intellectual property is 
lacking among the country’s students, 
even if they pursue fields that are IP- 
intensive. 
The ARTS Act helps close this 
awareness gap early on and allows 
these students to participate in the in-
tellectual property system without a 
financial burden. 
It builds on Congress’ work to en-
courage the creativity of our Nation’s 
youth with the establishment of the 
Congressional Art Competition nearly 
40 years ago and the Congressional App 
Challenge more recently in 2013. 
In the art competition, Members host 
a districtwide contest in which high 
school students compete to have their 
artwork hang in the Halls of Congress. 
In the app challenge, middle and high 
school students show off their com-
puter 
coding 
skills 
and 
compete 
against others in their district. 
Year after year, in both of these com-
petitions, the talent our students dis-
play is remarkable. Through both, we 
continue to see our youth encouraged 
to develop their artistic and tech-
nology talents, as Congress intended. 
The ARTS Act makes these competi-
tions even more impactful. Under the 
bill, students may apply to register a 
copyright for their winning artwork 
and winning app for free. This intro-
duces these students to the intellectual 
property system and the benefits of 
copyright protection. 
Under current law, the Register of 
Copyrights cannot waive these fees on 
her own. The ARTS Act amends the 
Copyright Act to allow such a fee waiv-
er for these specific circumstances. 
Mr. Speaker, I again applaud Mr. 
JEFFRIES and Ms. MACE for bringing 
forward this important bipartisan leg-
islation, which will aid the next gen-
eration of creators and innovators, and 
I urge my colleagues to support its pas-
sage. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
704, the Artistic Recognition for Tal-
ented Students Act, or ARTS Act. 
The Constitution authorizes Congress 
to promote the progress of science and 
the useful arts by securing, for limited 
times, to authors and inventors the ex-
clusive 
right 
to 
their 
respective 
writings and discoveries. 
Our copyright system is designed to 
help fulfill that mandate by promoting 
the work of authors, musicians, artists, 
and other creators. Creative industries 
contribute hundreds of billion of dol-
lars to the U.S. economy each year. 
This bill makes it easier for some of 
our brightest, young creators to obtain 
copyrights 
on 
their 
award-winning 
work. Promoting and encouraging the 
next generation of American creators 
ensures that our creative economy will 
remain strong for decades to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join in me supporting this bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JEFFRIES), the sponsor of 
this bill. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chairman of the com-
mittee from New York (Mr. NADLER) 
for yielding and his support, as well as 
the distinguished Member from the 
great State of North Carolina (Mr. 
BISHOP) for his support of this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
704, the ARTS Act, a bipartisan, bi-
cameral effort to support the student 
creators of America, help ignite their 
passions, and allow them to dream big. 
The Framers of our Constitution and 
the Founders of our great country un-
derstood that society would benefit if 
we incentivize creativity and innova-
tion. That is why Article I, Section 8, 
Clause 8 of the United States Constitu-
tion gives Congress the power to create 
a robust intellectual property system 
to promote the progress of science and 
useful arts. Many of our Founders, of 
course, were authors and inventors 
themselves. 
The ARTS Act seeks to build upon 
this principle and practice by helping 
to introduce the next generation of cre-
ators from around the country to copy-
right and intellectual property. 
Specifically, it would permit the 
Register of Copyrights to waive appli-
cation filing fees to register a copy-
right for those talented high school 
students who win the Congressional 
Art Competition or the Congressional 
App Competition each year. 
By doing so, student creators will be 
incentivized to register their works, al-
lowing them to gain experience with 
the copyright process and insight into 
its subsequent benefits and familiarize 
themselves with our intellectual prop-
erty system, which is in the fabric of 
the U.S. Constitution. 
We have often worked together in a 
bipartisan fashion to carry out our 
constitutional mandate in this space, 
as we are doing today. In the last Con-
gress, this bill unanimously passed the 
Senate, and it has bipartisan support 
in both Chambers. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to particu-
larly thank the original co-lead on this 
bill, Representative NANCY MACE, for 
her leadership and partnership on this 
legislation, as well as Senators TILLIS 
and LEAHY for leading this effort in the 
Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support our Nation’s next 
generation of creators and to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this straightforward bipar-
tisan, bicameral legislation. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary Committee, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 704, the ‘‘Artistic 
Recognition For Talented Students Act,’’ or 
Arts Act,’’ bicameral, bipartisan legislation that 
directs the Register of Copyrights to waive the 
filing fee for an application to register a copy-
right for a student’s work that has won the 
Congressional Art Competition or the Con-
gressional App Challenge. 
The Congressional Art Competition (‘‘Art 
Competition’’) and the Congressional App 
Challenge (‘‘App Challenge’’) are annual dis-
trict-by-district contests that recognize stu-
dents’ achievements in the visual arts and in 
the science, technology, engineering, and 
math (‘‘STEM’’) fields. 
The Art Competition began in 1982 to en-
courage students’ artistic creativity. 
High school students are eligible to partici-
pate by submitting two-dimensional artwork, 
which is typically judged by a panel of local 
artists. 
The App Challenge stems from H. Res. 77, 
adopted in the 113th Congress, which recog-
nized both the importance of STEM achieve-
ment to the country and the importance of en-
couraging students to appreciate and pursue 
career paths in STEM and established an aca-
demic STEM challenge to further those goals. 
Middle and high school students are eligible 
to participate in the App Challenge by creating 
a software app using any programming lan-
guage and any platform. 
Winners of the Art Competition have their 
work hung in the Cannon Tunnel for one year, 
and in the App Challenge, winning apps may 
be displayed in the Capitol or on the House’s 
website. 
H.R. 704 would add another element to the 
award winners’ prizes—winning students will 
be able to file an application to register a

copyright for their winning artwork or app with-
out paying a filing fee. 
H.R. 704’s filing fee waiver complements 
the related aims of both contests by intro-
ducing young artists and innovators to the in-
tellectual property system and the benefits of 
copyright protection. 
Intellectual property rights like copyright 
allow artists and innovators to protect and 
benefit 
economically 
from 
their 
work, 
incentivizing them to continue to pour time and 
resources into further creations and innova-
tions. 
Industries that rely on intellectual property 
have a significant economic impact and are in-
tegral to the U.S. economy. 
Despite intellectual property’s importance, 
studies show that students have low aware-
ness of intellectual property, even if they are 
likely to encounter intellectual property later in 
their careers. 
H.R. 704 helps close this awareness gap 
early on by introducing students who have 
shown interest in the arts and STEM to the 
possibilities of copyright registration and re-
moving the economic barrier for pursuing such 
registration. 
As part of the copyright application process, 
the winning works may also become a part of 
the Library of Congress’ collections and ar-
chives, 75 further spreading the reach of these 
students’ creations. 
Under current law, the Register of Copy-
rights does not have authority to waive filing 
fees for winning students on her own. 
Section 708(a)(1) of the Copyright Act pre-
scribes that fees be paid to the Copyright Of-
fice for filing an application for registration of 
a copyright, and the Register has only limited 
authority to waive fees involving the United 
States government. 
H.R. 704 amends this section to allow such 
waivers for the student winners of the Art 
Competition and App Challenge. 
I urge all members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 704, ‘‘Artistic Recognition For Tal-
ented Students Act,’’ or Arts Act.’’

ADVANCING MUTUAL INTERESTS 
AND GROWING OUR SUCCESS ACT 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2571) to include Portugal in the 
list of foreign states whose nationals 
are eligible for admission into the 
United States as E–1 and E–2 non-
immigrants if United States nationals 
are treated similarly by the Govern-
ment of Portugal and to otherwise 
modify the eligibility criteria for E 
visas, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2571 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLES. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Advancing 
Mutual Interests and Growing Our Success

SEC. 2. NONIMMIGRANT TRADERS AND INVES-
TORS. 
For purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of sec-
tion 101(a)(15)(E) of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(E)), Por-
tugal shall be considered to be a foreign 
state described in such section if the Govern-
ment of Portugal provides similar non-
immigrant status to nationals of the United 
States.

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on H.R. 2571. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2571, the Advanc-
ing Mutual Interests and Growing Our 
Success Act, or AMIGOS Act, would 
allow citizens of Portugal to partici-
pate in the E–1 and E–2 visa programs 
for traders and investors if Portugal 
provides reciprocal treatment to U.S. 
citizens. 
The E–1 Treaty Trader program pro-
vides temporary visas to individuals or 
employees of firms that engage in sub-
stantial trade with the United States. 
The E–2 Treaty Investor program 
provides visas to individuals so that 
they can develop and direct the oper-
ations of an enterprise in which they 
have invested a substantial amount of 
capital. 
The United States became Portugal’s 
largest trading partner outside the Eu-
ropean Union in 2015. Bilateral trade 
between our counties is growing at a 
rapid pace, from $4.2 billion in 2015 to 
$8.9 billion in 2019. 
Unlike most European Union coun-
tries, Portugal did not have a bilateral 
treaty with the United States before 
joining the European Union. Now, de-
spite being one of our closest allies and 
closest economic partners, they are one 
of only five European Union countries 
whose citizens are not eligible for E–1 
and E–2 visas. 
This is a bipartisan measure that we 
can all support. The bill simply would 
expand opportunities for Portuguese 
citizens to invest in the United States, 
facilitate trade, and create jobs for 
U.S. workers. 
The bill also strengthens the E visa 
programs by ensuring that individuals 
who obtain the nationality of a treaty 
country through an investment-based 
visa have sufficient ties to their new 
country of nationality before they can 
qualify for an E–1 or E–2 visa. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) for 
championing this issue and working 
across the aisle to build consensus on 
this legislation. H.R. 2571 will improve 
our economy and strengthen our ties 
with an important and longstanding 
ally. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2571, the Advancing Mutual Interests 
and Growing Our Success Act, or the 
AMIGOS Act. 
The bill makes nationals of Portugal 
eligible for E–1 and E–2 nonimmigrant 
visas, as long as Portugal allows recip-
rocal visas for U.S. nationals. E–1 visas 
are temporary visas available for trea-
ty traders, and E–2 visas are available 
for treaty investors. 
As stated in the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act, these visas are available 
to aliens who are ‘‘entitled to enter the 
United States under and in pursuance 
of the provisions of a treaty of com-
merce and navigation between the 
United States and the foreign state of 
which the alien is a national, and their 
spouse and children solely to either 
carry on substantial trade, including 
trade in services or trade in tech-
nology, principally between the United 
States and the foreign state of which 
the alien is a national, or to develop 
and direct the operations of an enter-
prise in which the alien has invested a 
substantial amount of capital.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2983 
June 22, 2021 
Alien employees of treaty traders 
and treaty investors may receive visas 
if they are coming to the United States 
‘‘to engage in duties of an executive or 
supervisory character; or, if employed 
in a lesser capacity, if they have spe-
cial qualifications that make the serv-
ices to be rendered essential to the effi-
cient operation of the enterprise.’’ 
E–1 and E–2 visa holders may be ad-
mitted initially for a period of 2 years, 
and can apply for extensions in 2-year 
increments. 
The U.S. has entered into treaties of 
commerce since at least 1815, when we 
entered into a Convention to Regulate 
Commerce with the United Kingdom. 
Currently, the nationals of 82 countries 
are eligible for E–1 and/or E–2 visa sta-
tus. 
b 1645 
During fiscal year 2020, almost 26,800 
E–1 and E–2 visas were issued, down be-
cause of the pandemic from roughly 
50,000 during fiscal year 2019. 
While the AMIGOS Act passed the 
House last Congress, the version we are 
considering today is somewhat dif-
ferent. The updated text includes lan-
guage, added at the request of Senator 
LEE from Utah, aimed at preventing 
abuse of the E visa program whereby 
an individual essentially purchases 
citizenship in a U.S. trade treaty coun-
try simply to be eligible to get a U.S. 
E visa. Specifically, the language re-
quires that an alien be domiciled in the 
U.S. trade treaty country for at least 3 
years before the individual can apply 
for an E visa. 
I thank Senator LEE for his commit-
ment to ensuring the integrity of our 
visa programs. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from New York, the 
chair of the Judiciary Committee, for 
bringing this bill to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2571, the Advancing Mutual Interests 
and Growing Our Success Act, or the 
AMIGOS Act. 
The AMIGOS Act is a bipartisan bill 
that I introduced along with my col-
leagues Mr. COSTA, Mr. KEATING, Mr. 
VALADAO, and Mr. KHANNA to encour-
age greater investment and trade be-
tween the United States and Portugal. 
H.R. 2571 makes Portuguese nation-
als eligible for E–1 and E–2 non-
immigrant investor visas. Extending 
visas to Portugal not only gives Por-
tuguese businesses an opportunity to 
invest in the United States, but it is a 
mutually beneficial relationship that 
promotes jobs in both countries and 
growth in United States businesses and 
our economy. 
The United States has no better 
friend than the country of Portugal. As 
one of the first countries to recognize 
the United States after the Revolu-
tionary War, Portugal is one of our 
closest economic partners and strong-
est allies. Today, the United States 
maintains that longstanding relation-
ship as the fifth-largest export market 
for Portugal and its largest trading 
partner outside of the European Union. 
I am proud to represent the First 
District of Rhode Island, home to one 
of the country’s largest and most vi-
brant Portuguese communities, a com-
munity that has made outstanding 
contributions in the arts, culture, busi-
ness, and public service in this country 
for many decades. 
The United States is Portugal’s larg-
est trading partner outside the Euro-
pean Union, with bilateral trade reach-
ing $6.6 billion in 2019. There are cur-
rently over 130 American companies 
operating in Portugal in a wide range 
of economic sectors, including pharma-
ceutical, chemical, technology, bank-
ing, and health sectors. 
In 2019, the United States’ direct in-
vestment position in Portugal was $2.3 
billion, an increase of 6 percent from 
2018. The direct investment position 
from Portugal in the United States, 
however, experienced a 1 percent de-
crease to $1.4 billion from 2018 to 2019. 
Portugal is one of only five EU coun-
tries whose citizens are not currently 
eligible for E–1 or E–2 visas. In the ab-
sence of a bilateral treaty, which Por-
tugal cannot enter due to the rules of 
the European Union, Congress has the 
power to authorize E–1 and E–2 visa 
benefits to other countries. We have 
exercised our authority to do so for 
both Israel in 2012 and New Zealand in 
2018. 
I am proud to lead this effort to sup-
port our ally and friend, Portugal. I en-
courage my colleagues to support H.R. 
2571, the AMIGOS Act, and I again 
thank Mr. NADLER for bringing the bill 
to the floor. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the AMI-
GOS Act is bipartisan legislation that 
would 
improve 
our 
economy 
and 
strengthen our ties with an important 
and longstanding ally. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2571, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
REDEFINING EASTERN AND MID-
DLE 
JUDICIAL 
DISTRICTS 
OF 
NORTH CAROLINA 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 1340) to amend title 28, United 
States Code, to redefine the eastern 
and middle judicial districts of North 
Carolina. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1340 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. JUDICIAL DISTRICTS OF NORTH 
CAROLINA. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 113 of title 28, 
United States Code, is amended— 
(1) in subsection (a), by striking ‘‘and Wil-
son and’’ and inserting ‘‘Wilson, those por-
tions of Hoke, Moore, Scotland, and Rich-
mond counties encompassing the Fort Bragg 
Military Reservation and Camp Mackall, 
and’’; and 
(2) by striking subsection (b) and inserting 
the following: 
‘‘(b) MIDDLE
DISTRICT.—The Middle Dis-
trict comprises the counties of Alamance, 
Cabarrus, 
Caswell, 
Chatham, 
Davidson, 
Davie, Durham (excluding that portion of 
Durham County encompassing the Federal 
Correctional 
Institution, 
Butner, 
North 
Carolina), Forsyth, Guilford, Hoke (exclud-
ing that portion of Hoke County encom-
passing the Fort Bragg Military Reservation 
and 
Camp 
Mackall), 
Lee, 
Montgomery, 
Moore (excluding that portion of Moore 
County encompassing the Fort Bragg Mili-
tary Reservation and Camp Mackall), Or-
ange, Person, Randolph, Richmond (exclud-
ing that portion of Richmond County encom-
passing the Fort Bragg Military Reservation 
and Camp Mackall), Rockingham, Rowan, 
Scotland (excluding that portion of Scotland 
County encompassing the Fort Bragg Mili-
tary 
Reservation 
and 
Camp 
Mackall), 
Stanly, Stokes, Surry, and Yadkin.’’. 
(b) APPLICATION.—The amendments made 
by subsection (a) shall not apply to any ac-
tion commenced or pending in any judicial 
district of North Carolina before the date of 
enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on S. 1340. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 1340 would redefine 
the boundaries of the middle and east-
ern districts of North Carolina to place 
Fort Bragg and Camp Mackall, a sub- 
installation of Fort Bragg located 
roughly 40 miles away, entirely within 
the eastern district, a very smart and 
instructive decision.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2984 
June 22, 2021 
After having been introduced by both 
Senators from North Carolina, S. 1340 
passed the Senate last week. H.R. 2746, 
the identical House companion to S. 
1340, which recently passed the Judici-
ary Committee, was introduced by a 
friend and colleague, Congresswoman 
ROSS, and Congressman HUDSON
and 
was cosponsored by every member of 
the North Carolina House delegation. 
This is bipartisan, bicameral legisla-
tion that will improve the administra-
tion of justice in North Carolina. 
Currently, even though Fort Bragg 
sits on the outskirts of Fayetteville, 
which is in the eastern district, the 
base straddles both judicial districts. 
The result of this split means that a 
Federal case arising on one part of 
Fort Bragg will be heard at the Fay-
etteville courthouse, which is roughly 
20 minutes away, while a case arising 
on another part of the base could be 
heard at courthouses more than 2 hours 
away. 
The logistical difficulties resulting 
from Fort Bragg’s split jurisdiction can 
extend beyond the inconvenience of un-
necessarily long travel times. In crimi-
nal cases, for example, courts have had 
difficulty 
ensuring 
that 
defendants 
have received notice of their rights. S. 
1340 will fix that and fix it now. 
I want to thank Ms. ROSS for her bi-
partisan work on this issue and for her 
enormous leadership in championing 
this legislation in the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this bill. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it as well, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 1340 will improve ju-
dicial economy by redefining the judi-
cial districts of my home State of 
North Carolina. 
Fort Bragg, which is located in North 
Carolina, is one of the U.S. Army’s 
largest military installations. It spans 
six counties and is approximately 250 
square miles large. Fort Bragg is lo-
cated in two judicial districts, the mid-
dle district and the eastern district of 
North Carolina. This has led to incon-
venience for both defendants and the 
courts system. 
S. 1340 redefines the judicial districts 
so that Fort Bragg and a sub-installa-
tion, Camp Mackall, are located in a 
single judicial district, the eastern dis-
trict. This change will streamline and 
improve judicial administration and ef-
ficiency. 
I want to thank Senator TILLIS and 
Senator BURR for their work on this 
bill. I also want to thank the former 
member from North Carolina, Mr. 
Holding. And I also want to thank my 
law school classmate, Representative 
ROSS, for sponsoring and the rest of the 
North Carolina delegation for joining 
me in cosponsoring the House com-
panion, H.R. 2746. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ROSS), who is 
the House sponsor of this very impor-
tant legislation. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
also to highlight this critical bill that 
will help North Carolinians. 
This commonsense legislation will 
revise North Carolina’s judicial district 
lines to place Fort Bragg, one of the 
largest military installations in the 
world, entirely within the eastern dis-
trict. Currently, the district lines bi-
sect the base, resulting in unnecessary 
administrative and logistical problems 
for the people of our State. 
This legislation will ease the burden 
of traveling miles to Durham, Greens-
boro, or Winston-Salem and, instead, 
let servicemembers resolve court mat-
ters in nearby Fayetteville or Raleigh. 
A similar redistricting occurred sev-
eral years ago when Congress moved 
Butner into the eastern district. 
This bipartisan piece of legislation 
will benefit our servicemembers and 
their families. 
I am honored to work with my North 
Carolina colleagues, Congressman HUD-
SON, Senator TILLIS, and Senator BURR, 
my colleague from law school class, 
and the entire delegation to get this 
bill across the finish line. I am pleased 
it passed out of the Senate, and I look 
forward to passing it in the House and 
having it signed into law by the Presi-
dent. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, this is sensible and prudent to 
the administration of justice in my 
home State. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this is a good day on the floor of the 
House. S. 1340 will improve the admin-
istration of justice in the Federal 
courts of North Carolina. 
This is not only a bipartisan, bi-
cameral effort, but it is also evidence 
of Republicans and Democrats working 
together for the uplifting of justice. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leader-
ship of Representative ROSS in bringing 
this bill forward, and I hope all of my 
colleagues will enthusiastically sup-
port this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 1340 would redefine the 
boundaries of the Middle and Eastern Districts 
of North Carolina to place Fort Bragg and 
Camp Mackall (a sub-installation of Fort Bragg 
located roughly 40 miles away) entirely within 
the Eastern District. 
After having been introduced by both Sen-
ators from North Carolina, S. 1340 passed the 
Senate last week. H.R. 2746, the identical 
House companion to S. 1340, which recently 
passed the Judiciary Committee, was intro-
duced by Congresswoman ROSS and Con-
gressman HUDSON and was cosponsored by 
every member of the North Carolina House 
Delegation. 
This is bipartisan, bicameral legislation that 
will improve the administration of justice in 
North Carolina. 
Currently, even though Fort Bragg sits on 
the outskirts of Fayetteville, which is in the 
Eastern District, the base straddles both judi-
cial districts. 
The result of this split means that a federal 
case arising on one part of Fort Bragg will be

logistical difficulties resulting from Fort Bragg’s 
split jurisdiction can extend beyond the incon-
venience of unnecessarily long travel times— 
in criminal cases, for example, courts have 
had difficulty ensuring that defendants have 
received notice of their rights. S. 1340 will fix 
that. 
I want to thank Ms. ROSS for her bipartisan 
work on this issue, and for championing this 
legislation in the House. I am pleased to sup-
port this bill, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it as well. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 1340 will improve the ad-
ministration of justice in the federal courts in 
North Carolina. 
I appreciate the leadership of Representa-
tive Ross in bringing this bill forward, and I 
hope all my colleagues will support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on H.R. 2679. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2679, the Founda-
tion of the Federal Bar Association 
Charter 
Amendments 
Act 
of 
2021, 
makes important changes to the Fed-
eral charter for the Foundation of the 
Federal Bar Association. 
This legislation is intended to give 
the Federal Bar Association the flexi-
bility it needs to operate well into the 
future without the need for further 
congressional amendment. 
Among other things, the legislation 
makes the following changes to the as-
sociation’s charter: 
It requires the board of directors to 
decide, and specify in the bylaws, the 
location of the principal office. 
It specifies that the bylaws, not the 
charter, must provide for the terms of 
membership, the responsibilities of the 
board of directors, and the election of 
officers. 
It prohibits a director or officer in 
his or her corporate capacity from con-
tributing to, supporting, or partici-
pating in political activities. 
It expands a prohibition on loans for 
directors and officers to include mem-
bers and employees. 
It specifies that on dissolution or 
final liquidation of the corporation, 
any remaining assets must be distrib-
uted as provided by the board of direc-
tors instead of deposited in the Treas-
ury. 
I thank Mr. CHABOT for introducing 
this important bipartisan legislation, 
along with Mr. RASKIN. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 2679 and, as well, support 
this insight and new look at justice, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2679, the Foundation of the Federal Bar 
Association Charter Amendments Act 
of 2021. 
The Federal Bar Association was 
founded in 1920 as a nonprofit organiza-
tion seeking to strengthen the Federal 
legal system and administration of jus-
tice. In 1954, Congress chartered the 
Federal Bar Association as a congres-
sionally chartered organization under 
title 36 of the United States Code. 
b 1700 
The FBA serves the Federal legal 
community and public by promoting 
standards of professional competence 
and ethical conduct, providing edu-
cational programs, and facilitating the 
administration of justice. 
The FBA is also committed to bring-
ing civics education programs to class-
rooms across the country. As a con-
gressionally chartered organization, it 
takes an act of Congress to make 
changes to the FBA’s charter. The FBA 
has not amended or updated its charter 
since 1954. 
H.R. 2679 amends the FBA’s current 
charter to allow the organization to 
choose the location of its principal of-
fice, restrict its officers from engaging 
in political activity, and change its 
charter language to conform with lan-
guage used in other congressional char-
ters. In addition, this legislation will 
allow the FBA to make simple changes 
to its bylaws without an act of Con-
gress. 
I want to thank my colleague, Mr. 
CHABOT
from Ohio, for his diligent 
work on this legislation. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
RASKIN), the distinguished gentleman 
who is the cosponsor of this legislation 
here in the House. We thank him so 
much for his leadership. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Texas for her 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to serve as 
the lead Democratic cosponsor of the 
bill introduced by my friend from Ohio 
(Mr. CHABOT), the Foundation of the 
Federal 
Bar 
Association 
Charter 
Amendments Act of 2021. 
The Federal Bar Association is the 
primary voluntary bar association for 
attorneys, both in the private and pub-
lic sectors, who practice in the Federal 
courts. The bill will permit the founda-
tion to better fulfill its role as the only 
institution chartered in America by 
Congress to promote the Federal ad-
ministration of justice, the advance-
ment of Federal jurisprudence, and the 
practice of law in the Federal courts by 
providing it with the organizational 
flexibility that it needs to grow and to 
adapt to its contemporary mission. 
The original charter created a frame-
work that has served FBA well for the 
last six decades. During these years, 
the foundation has, indeed, strength-
ened Federal jurisprudence and pro-
moted 
legal 
education 
and 
under-
standing at the Federal level, and it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

has improved the lives of a lot of peo-
ple. 
One community outreach program I 
know about through a number of my 
constituents is the Wills for Veterans 
initiative, which is a pro bono project 
where the FBA chapters provide the 
drafting of wills and signing services 
for veterans in our communities. 
Another initiative set up the Dr. J. 
Clay Smith Jr. Diversity in the Legal 
Profession Scholarship program, which 
aims to promote diversity in the pro-
fession and to promote the inclusion of 
racially and ethnically diverse stu-
dents in law schools and in the work of 
the Federal Bar Association. 
All of these programs and initiatives 
broaden and strengthen the legal com-
munity and need to be bolstered in the 
years ahead. To allow the FBA greater 
flexibility to operate and grow as the 
legal community changes, the current 
charter must be amended. 
In its current iteration, the existing 
charter codifies strict membership and 
governance 
requirements 
that 
con-
strain member development and nim-
ble governance of the organization. 
This rigidity presents serious chal-
lenges as the organization seeks to ex-
pand its critical educational and chari-
table work. 
H.R. 2679 makes technical fixes to the 
charter that will give the FBA the 
needed flexibility to advance its mis-
sion in the 21st century. In the place of 
legislatively fixed membership criteria, 
it permits FBA to establish and update 
membership criteria through the by-
laws process itself. Similar provisions 
authorize enhanced flexibility in the 
composition and duties of the members 
of its board. 
In general, the measure would enable 
the FBA to swiftly meet the needs and 
the priorities of the organization and 
improve the administration of Federal 
justice. I urge all colleagues to support 
the legislation. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Again, we have found ourselves strik-
ing a chord for justice and clarification 
to an important organization that 
stands for justice, the Federal Bar As-
sociation. I thank the sponsors of this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation makes a 
number 
of 
important 
changes 
to 
strengthen the charter of the Founda-
tion of the Federal Bar Association. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2679, the Foundation of

ments Act of 2021, makes important changes

This legislation is intended to give the Fed-
eral Bar Association the flexibility it needs to

It specifies that the bylaws—not the char-

ship, the responsibilities of the board of direc-

It prohibits a director or officer, in his or her 
corporate capacity, from contributing to, sup-
porting, or participating in political activities; 
It expands a prohibition on loans for direc-
tors and officers to include members and em-
ployees; and 
It specifies that on dissolution or final liq-
uidation of the corporation, any remaining as-
sets must be distributed as provided by the 
board of directors instead of deposited in the 
Treasury. 
I thank Mr. CHABOT for introducing this im-
portant bipartisan legislation, along with Mr. 
RASKIN. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation makes a num-
ber of important changes to strengthen the 
charter of the Foundation of the Federal Bar

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2987 
June 22, 2021 
S. 409 provides a bipartisan, short- 
term legislative solution to address a 
funding shortage in CFTC’s Customer 
Protection Fund. The Consumer Pro-
tection Fund is used to pay whistle-
blower awards that fund the salaries 
and expenses of the Whistleblower Of-
fice and the Office of Customer Edu-
cation and Outreach. 
Without this critical funding, CFTC 
would have to suspend some operations 
and furlough employees in the Whistle-
blower Office and the Office of Cus-
tomer Education and Outreach. 
This short-term solution is by no 
means a replacement for the much- 
needed comprehensive CFTC reauthor-
ization. It will still, though, be a posi-
tive step to ensure that the CFTC can 
accomplish the important mission to 
promote the integrity, resilience, and 
vibrancy of the U.S. derivatives mar-
kets. 
The 
Committee 
on 
Agriculture 
passed a committee print equivalent of 
this measure unanimously by voice 
vote last Wednesday. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 409. I want to second what my col-
league, the gentleman from California, 
has said about the importance of the 
CFTC Whistleblower Office and the Of-
fice of Customer Education and Out-
reach, and, of course, the employees 
who work in those offices. 
These offices help the Commission 
meet its mission to promote integrity, 
resilience, and vibrancy of the U.S. de-
rivatives markets. I am proud to sup-
port today’s legislation to avoid unnec-
essary disruptions to these activities 
and needless staff furloughs. 
The work in these offices, particu-
larly the Whistleblower Office, helps to 
root out violations of the law which 
harm individuals and undermine de-
rivatives markets. Fraud and market 
manipulation can steal customer funds, 
distort prices, disrupt orderly trading 
and settlement, and sap confidence in 
the fairness of our markets. Whistle-
blowers are a critical source of infor-
mation which helps the Commission 
protect the integrity of our commodity 
markets. 
I also want to emphasize that today’s 
legislation does not spend any new 
money or create any new programs. 
Rather, it sets aside existing funds to 
meet existing obligations. S. 409 en-
sures that funds to support the func-
tioning of the whistleblower and cus-
tomer education offices are tempo-
rarily prioritized over the funds to pay 
whistleblower awards in order to keep 
the offices fully functional. In the end, 
both obligations will be fully met as 
Congress intended. 
As the ranking member of the Com-
modity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit 
Subcommittee, I feel a particular re-
sponsibility to make sure that the 
CFTC has the best tools at its disposal 
to meet its mission. 
As we move forward in the coming 
months, I am looking forward to 
digging deeper into the work of the 
Commission and coming together to 
craft a responsible CFTC reauthoriza-
tion bill which makes permanent im-
provements to the Whistleblower Office 
funding mechanism and meets the 
needs of the 21st century financial reg-
ulator. 
I want to take a moment to thank 
Chairman SCOTT and Ranking Member 
THOMPSON for their willingness to in-
volve the whole committee in this leg-
islative effort. As a new member of the 
committee, I appreciated the oppor-
tunity to act as a body in support of 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to say simply that I am 
proud to support this legislation, and I 
urge my colleagues to support S. 409. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
KHANNA) that the House suspend the

THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE 
DONE 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of our newest Fed-
eral holiday. Juneteenth marks the 
critical point in our Nation’s history 
when the final enslaved Americans 
were freed from the evil bondage of 
slavery 156 years ago. 
Honestly, as a student growing up in 
Rhode Island, surrounded by mostly 
White classmates, I was never taught 
about Juneteenth. As much as I hate to 
admit it, Juneteenth was simply not a 
part of my education. 
Some of my colleagues have sug-
gested that we should ignore our his-
tory, as inconvenient or uncomfortable 
as it may be. Well, that is wrong. As a 
nation, we must own up to our mis-
takes and celebrate our ability to over-
come them, not attempt to sweep them 
under the rug. 
Juneteenth is every bit a part of 
American history. It is a time to honor 
those who fought so hard to end slav-
ery and to reflect on the work that re-
mains before true racial justice is 
achieved. 
As we celebrate last week’s vote, let 
us recommit ourselves to rooting out 
the systemic racism that still plagues 
our Nation. 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
the Declaration of Independence says 
that our God-given freedoms are life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
As Members of Congress, we made a 
commitment to uphold those freedoms 
equally for everyone, but Democrats 
and their radical allies are chipping 
them away. 
Let’s be clear. The Hyde amendment 
is not discriminatory. Instead, it is an 
essential safeguard that not only pro-
tects Americans’ right of conscience, 
but also has saved more than two mil-
lion lives from abortion since its first 
enactment in 1976. 
Until recently, it was also over-
whelmingly bipartisan. In fact, one of 
the most vocal supporters in Congress 
was then-Senator Joe Biden. He told 
one of his constituents in 1994, ‘‘The 
government should not tell those with 
strong convictions against abortion, 
such as you and I, that we must pay for 
them.’’ 
Well said, Mr. President. 
Since then, the purpose of Hyde 
hasn’t changed. The strong convictions 
of American people against abortion 
hasn’t changed. In poll after poll, they 
tell us they strongly support a wall of 
separation between abortions and tax-
payers. 
And the science hasn’t changed. If 
anything, it has proven beyond a shad-
ow of doubt that human life begins at 
conception. 
One thing, however, has changed: The 
Democrats. By putting Hyde on the 
chopping block, the message they are 
sending is clear and chilling; that the 
radical demands of the socialist left 
drown out common sense, science, and 
the views of most Americans; that the 
party of ‘‘safe, legal, and rare’’ is now 
the party of abortion on demand, until 
or even after the point of birth, and 
funded by taxpayers; and that the gov-
ernment will compel taxpayers to vio-
late their strongest convictions. 
Madam Speaker, the question before 
us today is a simple and straight-
forward moral issue. To represent the 
values of all Americans, Congress must 
respect their rights of conscience and 
not disregard them. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Committees on Energy and 
Commerce, Ways and Means, and the 
Judiciary be discharged from further 
consideration of H.R. 18, the No Tax-
payer Funding for Abortion, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
b 1930 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, on 
the Republican side, it is cleared, so 
there is only one party denying it.

CALLING 
ON 
NEED 
FOR 
COM-
PREHENSIVE 
MENTAL 
HEALTH 
LEGISLATION 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
this evening to call my colleagues’ at-
tention to the dire need for Congress to 
continue building upon recent progress 
to unlock the mysteries of the human 
brain and serious mental illness. Along 
with other legislation we are working 
on in the field of health, we have to 
create and pass robust mental health 
legislation. 
Alongside other members of our Con-
gressional Mental Health Caucus and 
the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental 
Health Task Force, we are pulling to-
gether legislation to establish a com-
prehensive Mental Health Crisis Re-
sponse Act. 
I invite all of our colleagues to please 
work with our bipartisan working 
group. America has waited too long. 
The fundamentals of our social econ-
omy depend on the good health of our 
citizenry, and their ability to access 
quality 
and 
affordable 
behavioral 
health services has for too long been 
ignored. 
Countless constituents face insur-
ance barriers when accessing mental 
health services, and we must address 
the negative social and physical deter-
minants of health that cause trauma 
and tragic illnesses. 
It is time for us to take meaningful 
action. Again, I invite my colleagues to 
join us in preparing this important leg-
islation.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Commit-
tees on Energy and Commerce, Ways 
and Means, and the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for 
Abortion Act to codify the Hyde 
amendment language, and I ask for its 
immediate consideration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2990 
June 22, 2021 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to share a letter to the edi-
tor from a constituent published this 
morning. Here is what he said: 
I worked the polls for 10 years, which 
included 20 elections and over 25 hours 
of training. As the years passed, tech-
nology improved, training got more ef-
ficient, and communications were state 
of the art. I am so proud to be an 
American and contributing to our sys-
tem of democracy. 
At my poll, five of us work together. There 
are also two watchers from each party. The 
results are posted on the door of the polling 
place immediately for residents to see. Votes 
are checked against duplications and death 
certificates. We have a paper ballot that can 
be matched to a voter machine. The ma-
chines are not hooked up to the internet, 
preventing interference and hacking. 
My heart breaks with every utterance of 
voter fraud. Please don’t let the GOP erode 
voting rights. 
Signed: Former Republican. 
I share this constituent’s frustration. 
We are both fed up with people repeat-
ing lies about the security of our elec-
tions in order to justify voter suppres-
sion. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, as 
a new mom expecting a child this fall, 
I will never forget my husband and I 
hearing our child’s heartbeat for the 
first time, truly the greatest miracle of 
life. But sadly, that culture and value 
of life are under attack. 
The Hyde amendment has histori-
cally been supported by both Repub-
licans and Democrats for more than 40 
years. 
American taxpayers should never be 
forced to pay for abortions, and since 
1976, this Chamber has agreed and 
passed the Hyde amendment with bi-
partisan support. But now, President 
Biden and House Democrats caving to 
the far left are trying to reverse course 
and strip the Hyde amendment from 
the budget. 
It is unacceptable that President 
Biden is destroying a policy that has 
saved over 2.4 million innocent Amer-
ican lives. 
Every President since Carter has 
signed the Hyde amendment into law. 
It is a critical lifesaving protection 
that goes beyond party-line politics. It 
is about human life and protecting the 
most innocent among us. 
The majority of Americans agree 
that taxpayer dollars should never be 
used to fund abortions. Democrats 
should listen. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, the No 
Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair has previously advised, the re-
quest cannot be entertained absent ap-
propriate clearance. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DANIEL 
DELGADO TORRES 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
CORREA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise to honor the life of one of 
my constituents, an Anaheim resident, 
Specialist Daniel Delgado Torres, who 
suddenly passed away on February 16 
in an automobile accident. 
The son of immigrants, I recently 
had the opportunity to meet with his 
mother and father, who told me a 
story. They said from the early days 
that they could remember, Daniel 
dreamed of being an American soldier. 
In 2016, he had the opportunity when he 
joined the United States Army, and he 
became the first of his family to join 
the military. 
He was deployed to Afghanistan and 
was awarded the Army Achievement 
Medal for helping save the lives of 
seven of his fellow soldiers. 
Daniel was just 22 when he passed 
away. He is survived by his parents, 
Teresa and Aurielo; his sister, Yasiry; 
his girlfriend, Noelia; and their young 
son, Joaquin. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Daniel for 
his service to our country.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. SMITH of New Jersey asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, 166 Members of Congress have 
cosponsored H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer 
Funding for Abortion Act, to make the 
Hyde amendment and other current 
abortion funding prohibitions perma-
nent and to ensure that the Affordable 
Care Act conforms with the Hyde 
amendment. 
According to public opinion polls, 
most Americans, almost 60 percent, ac-
cording to the Marist poll, agree that 
taxpayers should not be forced against 
their conscience to fund abortion. 
Years ago, then-Senator Biden wrote 
to constituents, explaining his support 
for the Hyde amendment, and said it 
would ‘‘protect both the woman and 
her unborn child. . . .’’ He said: ‘‘I have 
consistently—on no fewer than 50 occa-
sions—voted against Federal funding 
for abortions. . . . Those of us who are 
opposed to abortion should not be com-
pelled to pay for them.’’ So said Sen-
ator Biden. I totally agree. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18 and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House.

Chair previously advised, the request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance.

INFRASTRUCTURE IN AMERICA 
NEEDS OVERHAUL 
(Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to support acting, tak-
ing up and passing the American Jobs 
Plan and the American Families Plan. 
Our infrastructure is in dire need of 
an overhaul, and it can’t be put off any 
longer. 
We also need to invest in the human 
infrastructure in our country, and we 
don’t have to choose one over the 
other. 
Americans across the Nation rely on 
sustainable infrastructure to get their 
children to school, to get to work, to 
facilitate commerce. We need to build 
on the investments that this Congress 
has already made through the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, including dollars 
that are flowing to our communities. 
Madam Speaker, $2 million has re-
cently been sent to Milwaukee for the 
East-West Bus Rapid Transit project in 
my district, a green public transit op-
tion. 
I support the American Jobs Plan, 
bold investment to get every lead pipe 
in our country out from underneath 
our ground. 
I also support investments in paid 
leave, childcare, and expanded access 
to affordable and quality health insur-
ance. 
I urge my colleagues to support these 
measures.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. HARRIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, today, 
the House debated several bills to ad-
dress the health and safety of children 
and newborns, including those that 
would ban crib bumpers and mandate 
stability standards for furniture that 
could fall on children. 
Unfortunately, this body did not con-
sider any legislation that would con-
tinue to ensure that precious taxpayer 
dollars are not used to fund abortions 
that intentionally kill babies. At a 
time when this protection of the un-
born may be stripped from Federal 
funding bills for the first time in near-
ly 50 years, it should be pointed out 
that abortion ends exponentially more 
lives than crib bumpers or furniture. 
Madam Speaker, I, therefore, ask 
unanimous consent that the Commit-
tees on Energy and Commerce, Ways 
and Means, and the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for

CONGRESS MUST STOP VIOLENCE 
IN AMERICA 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise with a heavy heart with the ex-
tended amount of violence in this coun-
try that has taken hold of us through 
the pandemic, and now we seem to be 
under siege. 
No, it is not one isolated issue or 
community. It is not one isolated rea-
son. But it is a heavy burden on our 
children. Our children have experi-
enced an enormous amount of violence. 
I intend, in my subcommittee, to dis-
cuss and have a briefing on both gun 
violence and the impact on children, as 
well as violence, and to be able to work 
with the administration on collabo-
rative ways of dealing with the ending 
of gun trafficking that has been a 
source of the mass spreading of guns. 
Laws like permitless guns, though I 
know they are in 12 States, create a 
synergism of opportunity for guns to 
be spread everywhere, and then the 
lack of respect for the dignity of our 
children so that guns are not stored. I 
intend to introduce a gun storage bill. 
I ask that if you see something, say 
something. We must, as a Congress and 
America, stop the violence.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mrs. CAMMACK asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Hyde 
amendment, which is the longest pro- 
life precedent in American history. 
This amendment prevents our taxpayer 
dollars from ending the lives of soci-
ety’s most vulnerable, the unborn. 
Madam Speaker, for over 40 years, 
Congress, both Republican and Demo-
crat administrations, have supported 
the Hyde amendment to prohibit pub-
licly funded abortions. That tradition 
seems to have ended with this current 
administration. 
Protecting life is not and should not 
be a partisan issue. The President and 
congressional Democrats need to listen 
to the American people, who over-
whelmingly support life and continue 
to uphold this important protection. 
We as a country believe in life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness, 
which is why we must defend that vital 
first tenet of life and support the Hyde 
amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18 and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, the request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-

A TRIBUTE TO BRADLEY KARMEN 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute 
to a truly great public servant. Mr. 
Bradley Karmen served 41 years at the 
Department of Agriculture, most re-
cently as associate deputy adminis-
trator of Farm Programs at the Farm 
Service Agency. 
Put in perspective, President Lincoln 
established the Department of Agri-
culture in 1862, and Brad Karmen 
worked there for nearly one-third of 
the Department’s entire existence. 
Ironically, Brad is a city kid, having 
grown up on Long Island. He would be 
the first to tell you he knew nothing 
about agriculture or the Federal farm 
policy that he would help fashion over 
the course of nearly a half century. It 
is not an exaggeration to say that no 
regulation cleared the Farm Service 
Agency or farm law was enacted with-
out Brad’s careful eye and wise coun-
sel. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know how a 
Long Island kid with no knowledge of 
agriculture or farm policy came to 
dedicate his professional career to 
helping the American farmer, but I am 
sure grateful he did. 
Thank you, Brad, for your distin-
guished career of public service. God-
speed.

HONORING THE LIFE OF HUGH 
BROWN McNATT 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor the life of Hugh Brown McNatt, 
who passed away on June 1, 2021. 
Hugh was known throughout Georgia 
for his remarkable career as a trial 
lawyer for over 50 years. Born on June 
23, 1946, in Uvalda, Georgia, Hugh 
learned the importance of hard work, 
humility, and dedication to helping 
others. He flourished in law school and 
immediately began trying cases all 
over 
Georgia 
and 
throughout 
the 
southeast. 
After advocating for others his entire 
life, he won several awards, including 
the Tradition of Excellence Award and 
the 
Thomas 
O. 
Marshall 
Profes-
sionalism Award. 
Outside the courtroom, he was a 
member of many organizations, includ-
ing the American College of Trial Law-
yers, the American Board of Trial Ad-
vocates, and the International Society 
of Barristers. 
He left a lifelong impact on his com-
munity, Georgia politics, his countless 
friends, and his family. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all those who knew 
him during this most difficult time.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mrs. FISCHBACH asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
since 1976, the Hyde Amendment has 
protected American taxpayers from 
being complicit in the atrocity that is 
abortion on demand. And since 1976, 
the Hyde Amendment has been reau-
thorized on a bipartisan basis, signed 
into law by both Republican and Demo-
crat Presidents, and supported by most 
Americans, until now, as President 
Biden’s proposed budget eliminates it 
altogether. 
Madam Speaker, we are treading in 
dangerous territory. Democrats have 
completely abandoned millions of pro- 
life Americans just like me, who vehe-
mently oppose using taxpayer dollars 
to fund abortion. And even worse, they 
have done it for no other reason than 
to appease their own radical base. 
President Biden said it best in 1994: 
‘‘Those of us who are opposed to abor-
tion should not be compelled to pay for 
them.’’ And in 2006, he said: ‘‘Won’t 
support public funding of abortion.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18 and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House.

PRESIDENT BIDEN’S UNIFIED 
AGENDA 
(Mr. CRENSHAW asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to note an odd philosophy 
that I have seen amongst my Democrat 
colleagues, and it is this: The belief 
that if one regulation is good, then ten 
must be better. Of course, that is not 
true, but it is actually worse than that. 
The Biden administration is proposing 
2,500 new regulations; they call this 
‘‘the unified agenda.’’ I am not sure 
what is unifying about suffocating 
American 
businesses 
and 
workers 
under D.C. bureaucrats. 
We are killing our economy by the 
death of a thousand cuts. Our products 
will be more expensive, and that is if

their manufacturing isn’t just imme-
diately shipped off to China. 
Biden said he wouldn’t ban fracking 
outright, but will make it impossible 
to build new projects, build pipelines, 
or export our clean American natural 
gas that would decrease global carbon 
emissions. 
These new regulations will take away 
our choices on healthcare, encourage 
illegal immigration, discourage the en-
forcement of our immigration laws, 
and more than that, this philosophy of 
regulate at any cost will result in silly 
regulations like this: Reducing disturb-
ances to Hawaiian spinner dolphins 
from human interaction. 
This is not how we govern.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
WILLIAM JAMES LEAVY 
(Mr. FALLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of my god-
father 
and 
uncle, 
William 
James 
Leavy—a life very well-lived, he passed 
away February 16, 2021. 
Bill Leavy was married to his wife, 
my aunt, Gloria, for 67 years. They had 
three children: Cynthia, Cheryl, and 
Colleen, and one grandchild, Jonathan. 
Bill Leavy served in the United 
States Army in Korea in combat for 
two full years, and the horrors that he 
must have seen. 
In his later years, he worked as a let-
ter carrier for the post office and was 
awarded a 50-year gold membership in 
the National Association of Letter Car-
riers. 
His favorite pastime was poetry, and 
he was extremely proud of that; and his 
family knew him as an ‘‘Irish poet.’’ 
I look back on a life very well-lived. 
He was my godfather; he was my uncle; 
and he married the love of his life. 
He fought for this country because he 
loved this country. 
And if we could all honor all our vet-
erans, and, tonight, Bill Leavy. Thank 
you. 
f 
FUND THE POLICE FOR PEACEFUL 
STREETS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, in 
June of last year, the city of Portland, 
Oregon, cut $16 million from their po-
lice budget, and shut down a unit of 
the police which was designed to re-
duce violence in the city. 
As Republicans predicted—and a lot 
of others—this has not led to peaceful 
streets. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler 
has been forced to ask for more funding 
for police. 
This is not unique to Portland. Major 
cities across the U.S. have seen a spike 
in violent crime as they cut police 
budgets. Last year, New York City 
defunded their police department budg-
et by about $1 billion, or 9.2 percent. 
The result? Murder is up 17 percent; 
shooting incidents are up 77 percent. In 
Los Angeles, homicides are now up 23 
percent after a defunding. 
How much more evidence will the 
defund the police movement need be-
fore they admit they were wrong and 
innocent 
people 
are 
indeed 
being 
killed? On top of this, prosecutors in 
some areas are refusing to charge per-
petrators and putting criminals back 
on our streets to continue their crimes. 
We must push back against these 
radicals who want to defund the police 
and stop this crime wave. 
f 
WOKENESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about the state of affairs 
here in the people’s House and the ex-
tent to which the majority has been 
using the time on the floor of this valu-
able body, the people’s House, to pro-
mote wokeness first rather than Amer-
ica first. And this is what we see every 
single day. 
Madam Speaker, I have a few of my 
colleagues here tonight with me be-
cause this is such an important time in 
our country’s history. We have so 
many important issues we need to be 
addressing, ought to be addressing, and 
yet, the people’s House is not address-
ing them. And instead, the people’s 
House 
is 
focusing 
on 
advancing 
wokeness first instead of America first. 
I have got a number of things I am 
going to get into and talk about ad-
dressing these particular issues, but I 
would just note that my good friend’s— 
and someone I admire a great deal— 
birthday is tomorrow, and that is Jus-
tice Clarence Thomas. 
And for those who know his story and 
have read his biography, his autobiog-
raphy, written through the eyes of his 
relationship with his grandfather—‘‘My 
Grandfather’s Son’’—Justice Thomas, I 
think represents all that is great and 
good about this country. 
He represents all that is great and 
good about overcoming the devastating 
impact of Jim Crow laws in the South, 
the discrimination that we saw ramp-
ant in his native hometown of Savan-
nah, and watching his life story and 
walking through his life story, and the 
progression of what that meant and 
where he ended up and what he 
achieved. 
And then what we witnessed in that 
fall of 1991 with the obscene, absurd ac-
tions by the Senate Committee on the 
Judiciary—chaired, by the way, by 
then-Senator 
Joe 
Biden—attacking 
this good man, Clarence Thomas, at-
tacking his integrity, attacking his 
character. 
And yet, what do we see out of the 
life and service of Clarence Thomas but 
the embodiment of the fulfillment of 
the American Dream and a recognition 
of what you can achieve when you fight 
for it, when you work for it, and you 
overcome the odds against you. And 
what a beautiful story it is. 
And why do I raise that now? Because 
in a world of wokeness, in a sea of 
wokeness, all driving an agenda—pur-
poseful, by the way, by my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle—to divide 
this country by race, to divide this 
country, and to highlight issues of divi-
sion and separation, as Justice Roberts 
fairly eloquently stated, he said: ‘‘It’s a 
sordid business, this divvying us up by 
race.’’ And we see it every single day. 
And it is highlighted by this body. I am 
going to go through that in a minute. 
Madam Speaker, every single thing 
this administration, every single thing 
this Democrat-led House of Represent-
atives, everything that the Democrat- 
led United States Senate is doing, is 
designed very purposely to divide us by 
race, and we should be better than 
that. 
And I think there are things that we 
all know that are on the minds of the 
American people, whether it is increas-
ing prices, because we spent $6 trillion 
and lumber prices are going up, and 
housing prices are going up. We have a 
border that is under assault; cartels 
who run our border. And we are turning 
the keys of the kingdom over to Iran 
and China instead of siding with Israel. 
And we are flooding the economy with 
dollars and driving up inflation, but 
also racking up mountains of debt. All 
of these things are occurring. 
And the regulations that my friend 
from Texas, Mr. CRENSHAW, was just 
talking about, the regulation-stran-
gling business, we are paying people 
more not to work than to work. 
And all of our small businesses are at 
home going, ‘‘stop it. Please stop it.’’ I 
have introduced legislation set up to 
end those unemployment benefits. 
Will we debate those here in this 
Chamber? 
No. No, sir. 
Why? Because we are going to ad-
vance woke legislation. We are going 
to talk about woke bills. We are not 
going to talk about all the small busi-
nesses—by the way, often owned by mi-
norities, often owned by people who 
need to be able to hire people and they 
can’t because this institution spent $6 
trillion and doled it out to destroy the 
American Dream by paying people 
more to work than to not work. It is 
absolutely astounding. 
And that is what we have. This 
Chamber is empty. What have we done 
today? We have voted on a couple of 
random bills—I don’t know if they are 
suspension bills or what we did today. 
What are we even going to do this 
week? 
The 
American 
people 
don’t 
know, because we are not doing any-
thing. They’re looking at this Chamber 
and they are saying: What are you 
doing? 
We have an obligation to fight and 
defend the American people and to do

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2993 
June 22, 2021 
our job, and I am delighted to have my 
friends from Texas here. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for having this Special 
Order on such a crucial time in our his-
tory. 
You don’t have to look hard to see 
the devastation left behind from the 
wokeism movement currently plaguing 
our beloved country. Our schools and 
our universities, our esteemed and 
feared military, our government on 
every level, and our history itself are 
being contaminated by those pushing 
socialism and division under the guise 
of being morally woke. 
b 2000 
Webster’s dictionary defines the word 
‘‘woke’’ as being ‘‘aware of and ac-
tively attentive to imparted facts and 
issues, especially issues of racial and 
social justice.’’ 
Well, I can tell you with absolute cer-
tainty that I am woke to the following: 
First, I am woke to the fact that in-
nocent 
men, 
women, 
and 
children 
across the country are being hurt and 
killed because of the left’s call to 
defund the police around this Nation. 
I am woke to the fact that Demo-
crats are more than willing to spend 
your hard-earned tax dollars on hous-
ing and free handouts for illegal aliens, 
but cannot be bothered to care for our 
homeless and our veterans. 
I am woke to the fact that the Crit-
ical Race Theory is racist in itself. 
And, lastly, I am woke to the fact 
that painting America as a racist na-
tion is wrong on every level and a slap 
in the face to those of every color, 
every ethnicity, and creed who coura-
geously paid the ultimate sacrifice so 
Old Glory could wave boldly and freely 
for years to come. Now I am hearing 
calls from the far left and those who 
are woke to replace our beloved Old 
Glory. 
Where has common sense gone? 
If the left truly wants to discuss so-
cial justice, I encourage them to talk 
to the countless minority business 
owners who watch their life’s work be 
looted and burned in front of their very 
eyes 
last 
year 
because 
of 
woke 
ideologies. 
Go talk to the engineer who was fired 
and can’t pay his bills now because 
President Biden has foolishly blocked 
the Keystone pipeline. Go talk to the 
migrant woman who was assaulted and 
raped during her trek to the southern 
border of the United States because 
Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS told her 
to come here and invited her here. 
I could go on, but here is the bottom 
line: If we don’t stand firmly against 
this 
movement, 
America, 
whose 
mighty wings have fought to defeat 
evil tyrants, communism, and Nazism 
in order to lift freedom-loving people 
out of the hands of oppressors all over 
this world, could soon be a socialist 
dictatorship herself and completely un-
recognizable to all who love her and 
fought for her and died for her. And a 
world without a free America is a dark 
world indeed. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Texas, and I appreciate 
his remarks and his comments very 
much. 
Madam Speaker, in just a minute I 
am going to turn it over to the other 
gentleman 
from 
Texas—in 
just 
a 
minute—and I know he has got some 
issues he wants to talk about involving 
border security. 
Because, as three representatives 
from Texas here, I think I can speak on 
behalf of the entire delegation, at least 
the Republican side of the delegation, 
that our State is under siege. Our 
State is under siege in a way that it 
has not been for upwards of almost 180 
years. 
And you think about what is hap-
pening at the border and the extent to 
which cartels have operational control 
of our border, the extent to which we 
have attacks on American citizens, 
ranchers who are getting their fences 
torn down, ranches that are being ran-
sacked. 
We have people who are struggling. 
We have migrants who are dying in 
these ranches, migrants who are dying 
on the rivers. We have migrants who 
are being abused on the journey. We 
have little girls who are being abused. 
If you spend a minute, a minute on 
the Rio Grande, instead of pontifi-
cating in this godforsaken Chamber, 
and you go talk to these migrants who 
are coming across the Rio Grande, then 
you see what is actually happening to 
these human beings all in the false 
name of compassion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS), and 
I would ask what his views are about 
the current state of things with respect 
to the border. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman ROY for not only 
standing in tonight to speak forth-
rightly to the American people, but 
also including other Members of the 
Texas delegation to have conversations 
with the American people not just 
about the topic of being woke, but ac-
tually the things that are actually hap-
pening to the United States of Amer-
ica. 
The Congressman is exactly right, 
there is a crisis in America today. 
There is a crisis that takes place be-
cause of such a rapid and swift transi-
tion to the ultraleft. The transition 
that has taken place began imme-
diately upon President Biden accepting 
the oath of office and walking, driving, 
going back to the White House after he 
had taken an oath of office, where he 
raised his hand and he repeated, among 
the other words, to ‘‘well and faithfully 
execute the laws of the United States.’’ 
Well, there is a little bit more than 
just ‘‘well and faithfully execute the 
laws of the United States.’’ I believe 
the American people want and need a 
stable person who will recognize that 
they need someone to work in their 
best interest, in the best interest of 
their community, in the best interest 
of their job, in the best interest of safe-
ty, in the best interest of trying to give 
every single person in this country a 
better opportunity to have a better 
life. That is what I believe is behind 
the ‘‘well and faithfully execute the 
laws of the United States.’’ 
In fact, what has happened is there is 
a sweeping revolution that is going on 
in the United States of America by the 
elected officials. Elected officials who 
have turned a blind eye to the things in 
the past that were seen as stable, as 
reasonable, and something that was in 
the best interest to protect the people 
that they represent. 
Day after day we have watched what 
happened down at the southern border 
of this country. I, too, went down. I am 
no stranger to the border. I previously 
lived in El Paso, Texas, for a number of 
years. My father served as the chief 
judge of the Western District of Texas 
and had to deal with not just the 
crime, but some of the circumstances 
that happened along the border. They 
came home to roost, so to speak, with-
in the United States of America. 
And as a Federal district judge, he 
tried his best to deal favorably, fairly, 
with people who violated the law. But 
where there were people who were 
criminals, who were not here to serve 
in the best interest of the United 
States of America, those who would be-
come enemies of the State because 
what they did is they would import 
drugs, drugs which would kill Ameri-
cans. 
We have just been through a terrible 
epidemic in this country of opioid 
abuse. Opioid abuse that we all recog-
nize, much of it was inherently begun 
and started here in the United States, 
but that has taken hold with other 
drugs 
now, 
fentanyl, 
methamphetamines, heroin, cocaine. 
And in that process, we look to where 
this comes from. This comes from 
other countries, by and large, other 
countries who have people who want to 
kill and make money off the demise of 
the American people. 
Yet the President of the United 
States, at the time he served as Vice 
President—because I know because the 
Drug Enforcement Administration sen-
ior officials have repeatedly said that 
the intelligence that was given to the 
then-Vice President, now President of 
the United States, they understood 
firsthand the danger that came from an 
open border. 
The dangers that came when we did 
not have active law enforcement and 
intelligence would cause the deaths of 
thousands of Americans because of the 
illicit drugs. Illicit drugs that not only 
are addicting, but many times mixed in 
a way that a user never knew they 
were taking them. The availability of 
fentanyl, as an example. 
Yet the President of the United 
States, with this vast knowledge of un-
derstanding from his service to the

June 22, 2021 
country as chairman of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, as chairman of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, as Vice 
President of the United States, he al-
ready knew the story. 
The story that he wanted to project 
was that he is a kid from Pennsyl-
vania, who knew what real America is. 
But what has happened is that he per-
sonally, and the radical left, have cre-
ated a circumstance in this country 
that, we, as Republicans, are talking 
about tonight. That we are supposed to 
be woke to understanding the social 
implications. The enormous implica-
tions to people that we represent. 
Yet, seemingly, it is the police that 
are the problem. Seemingly, it is the 
border that is the problem by enforcing 
the law. Seemingly, it is the ability 
that they want for criminals to run 
rampant 
throughout 
not 
just 
our 
neighborhoods, but across this country. 
Madam Speaker, I would say to the 
young Congressman from Texas that 
we need his voice, his voice of compas-
sion, his voice of common sense that 
says we need to move this country 
back to where it was simply a few 
months ago. Where we respect mem-
bers of law enforcement, men and 
women of law enforcement who make 
house calls because they are asked to 
come and make dispute resolution 
many times, and then to take care of 
the law as it applies to a circumstance. 
We need to get back to where we un-
derstand that the men and women of 
not just the U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection and U.S. Border Patrol are 
back on their job instead of being 
moved over to take care of 1 million 
people who, in the first 6 months, have 
come through illegally. 
We need to go back to elected offi-
cials who actually understand that the 
people who elected them aren’t for 
woke. What they are for is this body to 
come together to where we understand 
that we have an obligation to protect 
the men and women and children and 
seniors and disabled people of this 
country. We have an obligation to 
stand behind our law enforcement and 
to provide them with better training 
and the things that they need, equip-
ment, to properly do their job. 
Instead, we are watching our coun-
try, whether it is Chicago or Los An-
gles or New York City where criminals 
run rampant because of woke, that 
says we are supposed to defund the po-
lice department. We are supposed to 
defund those activities that would offer 
safety and security and opportunity for 
the most vulnerable of our society, and 
then blame others when people of color 
or of different races are harmed by 
criminals and thugs. 
I watched this morning on TV of the 
murder that took place in Chicago of 
the young couple that came to a stop-
light and were accosted and killed by 
thugs, criminal thugs. 
I watched about a young man walk-
ing down the street in broad daylight 
in New York City and was stabbed re-
peatedly by a criminal this weekend. 
No wonder this happens. We have al-
ready run the police out of town. We 
have already run people out of town 
who legitimately can stand up and 
have that obligation. 
Madam Speaker, I come here tonight 
to join my two Texas colleagues to say, 
woke may be a term that we are sup-
posed to get about enlightenment that 
we need to be good and better to each 
other, that we need to understand that 
there are people who might not agree 
with me, and I might not agree with 
them. 
b 2015 
But ‘‘woke’’ has taken on a different 
theme. It has taken on a theme of tak-
ing on responsibility and respect. It 
has taken away the ability that we 
have in this body to effectively even be 
heard by each other. It has taken away 
the ability of millions of Americans to 
where they no longer feel the safety 
and security of their own home, of 
their own city street, or even their 
ability to stand up to those who have a 
different opinion. 
Madam Speaker, I think what Con-
gressman ROY is doing tonight is more 
than just standing up and expressing 
an opinion. It actually is an opinion 
that I believe millions of Americans 
support and respect by this gentleman 
doing this Special Order tonight. 
I would call on this House of Rep-
resentatives and all of its Members to 
understand that this phase we are 
going through will have a very dif-
ficult, difficult conclusion for many 
people 
who 
cannot 
effectively 
get 
through what is happening to them, to 
people who live in cities where police 
will no longer be, to small businesses 
that are burned to the ground, and to 
judges who are no longer judging based 
upon the rule of law but rather fear. 
Madam Speaker, we as the Repub-
lican Party are not standing up and 
yelling and screaming. We have much 
resolve to us. But we ask tonight that 
the American people hear us that we 
condemned what happened on January 
the 6th. We condemn what is happening 
when people take advantage of law en-
forcement, take advantage of people, 
and take advantage of this great coun-
try. 
Let us hope that tonight in our re-
solve of speaking forthrightly and hon-
estly that we want to be that great 
country with shining cities on the hill 
where people work together, where peo-
ple have a common interest and goals 
for their communities, and generations 
of people can work together whether 
you be a retired senior citizen, Madam 
Speaker, or whether you be a young 
child who knows not except that you 
live in a great country. 
We need to speak plainly, but we are 
not yelling and screaming. We are not 
blaming someone else for the problems. 
But we will say this: The Republican 
Party of this House of Representatives 
stands for people to be safe in their 
own homes, for women who are in their 
own homes with their own children 
who will not be taken advantage of be-
cause they do know they have a backup 
and that is the police departments, 
that they know that the rule of law 
will effectively provide them with the 
needs that they have to live in the 
greatest country in the world, that our 
law enforcement agencies will know 
that they can continue to evolve into 
professionalism, that they will be able 
to effectively heal themselves and 
make the changes. 
I call on law enforcement to continue 
to make these changes. My Republican 
Party has these conversations with law 
enforcement every day. But I call on 
the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, Christopher Wray, just 
as when my father, Judge William Ses-
sions, was Director of the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation, to stand up for 
law enforcement and expect them and 
want them to become professional. 
Madam Speaker, we must heal what 
has happened. 
Sunday, at church, I heard no less 
than 50 times the word redemption, the 
words that we are sinners, that we 
make mistakes, that we need to look 
at each other with the faithfulness of a 
great nation. I heard words of love and 
respect for those even that we disagree 
with. 
But, Madam Speaker, we are not 
down pounding on tables tonight. We 
are simply trying to say what we be-
lieve is true, and that is that I believe 
that there are tens of millions of Amer-
icans who want and need this country 
to be safe. They want and need our 
elected officials, whether they be Re-
publican or Democrat, that they need 
their elected officials to understand 
that their life and their family are im-
portant, and that until we get back to 
the standards of performance of expec-
tations where law enforcement is al-
lowed to effectively and professionally 
be there as the backup, where our mili-
tary knows that we are there to sup-
port them and that our elected officials 
will stand on the side of righteousness, 
we are going to continue to wander 
through this terrible time that I call 
chaos. 
It is my hope, as we drop to our 
knees this evening, that we do offer a 
prayer for our President, President 
Biden. I know him, and I know he has 
been through difficult times in his life. 
But, Madam Speaker, I would ask to-
night that we give respect and prayer 
and ask that the President please un-
derstand that the most vulnerable who 
are there still need others to be of as-
sistance, and we need to make sure 
that this country heals itself with love, 
respect, and admiration for each other. 
I want to thank the young Congress-
man for tonight, for his bringing forth 
this opportunity to speak about where 
our country is. I want him to know 
that I personally admire him, respect 
him, and appreciate his sound call for a 
voice of reason and opportunity for 
America’s future. 
May God bless our country. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for allowing me to speak.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2995 
June 22, 2021 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Texas. I particularly 
thank him for referring to me as 
young. I will take it. 
Interestingly, and I will probably 
have more to say about this, but it was 
10 years ago in July that I was diag-
nosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, with 
a 4-month-old daughter and a not quite 
2-year-old son, not 100 percent sure 
whether I was going to be able to do 
like I did last weekend and go see my 
son play Little League baseball and see 
my daughter go off to camp last week. 
Madam Speaker, that will shift your 
world view a little bit, as they say, 
about what is important and what is 
not important. I can tell you, Madam 
Speaker, that my dedication to public 
service was fully renewed after getting 
through that. 
I was very blessed that I got through 
cancer-free in a matter of months, and 
Lord willing, I am still cancer-free. 
There is plenty of wood around here, 
but I knocked on my head instead. 
I am honored the gentleman took the 
time to come down here and join me 
and say such nice things. I know the 
gentleman knows that part of the pur-
pose here is our collective desire in this 
body to do what is right for this coun-
try. 
What I cannot for the life of me un-
derstand is why my Democratic col-
leagues continue to insist on using this 
body to stoke division and to separate 
us by race, by sex, and by wherever we 
come from—all the different ways they 
could possibly come up with to divide 
us rather than finding ways for us to 
unite together to protect, defend, se-
cure, and advance this country going 
forward. 
My colleagues from Texas know—I 
know my friends from Texas know—it 
has been a full 90 days since the Vice 
President of the United States was 
tapped by the President of the United 
States to be in charge of the border, 
yet the Vice President has not taken a 
second to come to the Rio Grande, to 
come to the Rio Grande Valley, to 
come to the border. 
Now, it wouldn’t be enough just to 
come. By the way, if the Vice President 
is listening, it is not enough just to go. 
But it sure would be nice if she could 
find the southern border on a map, get 
in her taxpayer-funded airplane, take a 
direct flight down to the border, and go 
take the time to meet with Texans, to 
go take the time to meet with mi-
grants, to take the time to meet with 
local leaders, and to see what is actu-
ally happening in real time at the bor-
der. 
I know the gentleman knows full well 
that we just had 180,000 apprehensions 
in May. We have had over 700,000 appre-
hensions this year, and we have had 
over 200,000 got-aways. The Border Pa-
trol estimates 1,000 got-aways every 
single day coming through between the 
ports of entry because our Border Pa-
trol is now running processing centers 
in McAllen. 
We all know this. I believe the Vice 
President knows this. I sent the Vice 
President a memo outlining this just in 
case she doesn’t know. 
But it is happening to us in real 
time. It is happening to migrants in 
real time, and it is happening to ranch-
ers in real time. I know my friends 
from Texas know that we have had 
7,500 pounds of fentanyl that have been 
intercepted by Border Patrol. Fentanyl 
is killing our children. 
What are we going to vote on this 
week? What are we going to do this 
week? I don’t even know. 
I flew back here from Texas, and I 
have half my colleagues still voting by 
proxy even though we are not wearing 
masks. We are still voting by proxy by 
saying: I am voting proxy because of 
the pandemic. 
We are not even having half of our 
committee meetings because we are 
doing them virtually. We are doing 
them when we are home in our work 
periods. 
Why aren’t we here? Why aren’t we 
here when there are 7,500 pounds of 
fentanyl pouring into our border? That 
is just the stuff we are capturing, by 
the way. 
Do you know how many children are 
dying with marijuana that has been 
laced with fentanyl? It is happening 
right now, Madam Speaker. 
You hear about the 80,000, 90,000 
opioid deaths last year. Madam Speak-
er, do you know where this stuff is 
coming from? 
Why did Governor DeSantis send re-
sources to Texas to help secure our 
border? People said: Why would you do 
that? That is Texas. Because the map 
and the drugs that are coming into 
Florida are coming through the South-
west border, and anybody who follows 
it knows that to be true. 
Why is that? Because the cartels that 
are now running the border profit im-
mensely by moving human beings for 
profit and by moving fentanyl for prof-
it. 
The Cartel Jalisco New Generation 
just absorbed the Laredo faction and 
just absorbed the Cartel del Noreste of 
Los Zetas in Nuevo Laredo. They now 
have 
operational 
control 
of 
Tamaulipas. That is a dangerous car-
tel. 
They are moving fentanyl for profit 
and moving human beings for profit, 
millions of dollars a day. We know this 
to be true. We know this from law en-
forcement agents on the ground—Tex-
ans, Federal authorities, Border Pa-
trol, and ICE. 
But they are not able to do their job 
because they are running processing fa-
cilities, processing facilities for human 
beings who we say we are helping be-
cause we are saying that we are giving 
them asylum. By the way, they are not 
claiming asylum under the statute 
that the asylum laws were meant to 
provide. 
They come across the river, and 
there is a sign on trees at the Rio 
Grande. 
By the way, the Vice President and 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle would know this if they bothered 
to go to the Rio Grande. 
If you walk down to the river, 
Madam Speaker, there is a sign. It says 
‘‘asilo’’ with an arrow, and it points to 
a bunch of bright lights sitting under 
the bridge, saying go over there. 
When I was at the river, I met about 
50 migrants at about midnight. There 
was a group of them, and they were 
lost. They were going around in circles. 
So, I drove my truck down the path so 
they would have light in the dark, so 
they could get to the processing center. 
These are good people seeking a bet-
ter life. Ask every single one of them 
why they are coming here, and it is for 
a job and opportunity. It wasn’t for 
asylum under our laws. We are making 
a mockery of our laws by saying that 
anyone who wants to come to our coun-
try for opportunity—God bless them, I 
understand why; I probably would too. 
If you look at the opportunity you 
have here, Madam Speaker, as opposed 
to El Salvador, Guatemala, or Hon-
duras right now, I understand. But we 
are turning our laws upside down. That 
is not what asylum laws are for. 
Why don’t we just sit down and figure 
it out? Madam Speaker, you can’t just 
say wide-open borders. You can’t. It is 
irresponsible. 
Listen to the leaders of Honduras, 
Guatemala, and El Salvador. They say 
it is irresponsible because it is dev-
astating their own countries. 
People say: Why don’t they fix it? We 
should have policies to work with them 
to try to fix it. 
But do you know what would fix it 
the most, Madam Speaker? If we didn’t 
have a wide-open border. If we actually 
stood up and said: Sorry, you can’t just 
come in unless you actually qualify 
under our asylum laws, which is a frac-
tion, a tiny fraction, of the 700,000-plus 
apprehensions that we have appre-
hended since January 1. 
But why aren’t we here debating 
that? Why aren’t we coming up with a 
solution to this problem so that mi-
grants aren’t being abused as I speak 
by cartels so they can make money? 
b 2030 
This is the greatest country in the 
history of the world, but we allow that 
to occur. We allow that to occur, and 
we do so in the name of compassion. 
We do so when people stand up and say: 
Oh, well, we want to make sure these 
folks will get here. 
Meanwhile, we have people scream-
ing: Kids in cages. 
Anybody remember that? Anybody 
remember the kids in cages? How many 
of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle ran to the cameras, sat in 
hearings, and screamed: Kids in cages? 
The very structures put in place by 
the Obama-Biden administration. It is 
a fact. Everybody knows that that is 
who created the chain-link barriers in 
these facilities at the border. Nobody 
blamed Obama and Biden for doing 
that. 
Air flow, ability to see the migrants, 
protect them. Oh, no, everybody went 
out and said: Kids in cages.

Why? 
Because we had a massive influx. 
But they said: Oh, they are drinking 
out of toilets. 
It was a lie. They weren’t drinking 
out of toilets. They were drinking out 
of a device that had the water fountain 
on the top with the toilet down below. 
We have them in facilities all over, in 
prisons facilities, where we have people 
coming in. The water supply in the 
bathroom right off of this floor is con-
nected to the same water supply be-
tween the toilet and the sink. It is a 
pipe behind the drywall. 
Yet they went around saying: Kids 
drinking out of toilets. 
It is shameful. We can’t have a ra-
tional conversation about what is actu-
ally happening in Texas. It is bad. 
There are children in stash houses 
right now. 
Why are we sitting here doing noth-
ing? Why are we going to have a vote 
this week on two suspension bills in a 
quest to go after more wokeness for, I 
think it is, some LGBTQ small busi-
ness bill or something on a suspension 
that failed to get through on the two- 
thirds vote? 
Okay. Debate that. Have it out. They 
tried to get it through on suspension. 
It didn’t get through. So we are going 
to do a rule. We won’t have any real de-
bate on it, by the way. Everything that 
the American people see in here is all a 
sham. There is no actual debate on the 
floor of this body. And anybody who 
wants to come debate me on that, I am 
happy to debate it. There is no debate 
on the floor of the people’s House, ever. 
We haven’t had an amendment on the 
floor of the House of Representatives, 
the people’s House, since May of 2016, 
that was in order on open debate on the 
floor of the House so that any one of 
my colleagues could walk down here 
and say: Hey, I have got an idea. There 
is a bill. You know what I would like to 
do? I would like to change something 
in the bill. Here is an amendment. I 
would like to send it to the desk, offer 
my amendment. Hey, what do you 
think about my amendment? It might 
make the bill better. 
Do you know when I would have 
liked to have had a debate on that? 
Last Friday. 
I would have liked to have had a de-
bate on the Juneteenth bill. 
Why? 
Because the purpose of that bill was 
excellent. The fulfillment of the Dec-
laration of Independence with the end-
ing of slavery, which we recognize in 
Texas because of Juneteenth, I didn’t 
support the bill because I didn’t think 
the title was good. There were some 
other factors. But I didn’t support it, 
and I would have liked to have amend-
ed it. Never got a chance to do it, ever. 
I would have liked to have had the abil-
ity to amend it, but couldn’t do it. 
All right. So you are forced with an 
up or down vote. We have 2,000-page 
bills that are $2 trillion. They are 
dropped on the floor and they say take 
it or leave it. And I say, you know 
what? I would like to cut something or 
add something. Can’t do it. 
I can go up to the Rules Committee 
and say: Here is my thing. And it gets 
voted down in the Rules Committee. 
If you see amendments on the floor of 
the House, it is all a fraud. It is all a 
fraud. They are hand-picked amend-
ments designed to make it look like we 
are amending, but we are not. 
You know, 15 amendments from the 
majority, 5 amendments from the mi-
nority, bam. Hey, look at that. That is 
debate. We are killing our country by 
partisan dropping of bills, no matter 
who is in the majority, by the way. 
I said that we haven’t had an amend-
ment on the floor since 2016. Guess who 
was in control of the House for 2 years 
of that? 
Republicans. 
When are we actually going to sit 
down and debate this stuff and do the 
things that matter? 
Again, I go home to Texas and every-
body is saying: How can you possibly 
be allowing this to be occurring on our 
border? 
It is the fundamental duty of the 
Federal Government to secure the bor-
der of the United States, yet we have 
fentanyl pouring in. We have cartels 
who run the border. We have Mexico 
becoming a narco-terrorist state. We 
have danger to citizens in our country 
actually occurring. 
We have human trafficking and sex 
trafficking occurring in San Antonio, 
Austin, all the way up I–35, going over 
to Houston. We stopped cars in the San 
Antonio suburbs that have nine immi-
grants in them going to a stash house 
in Houston, driven by an American cit-
izen employee of a cartel. 
I offered an op-ed explaining that to 
the San Antonio Express-News, along 
with the district attorney of Kendall 
County, Texas, and the San Antonio 
Express-News wouldn’t print it, a fact- 
based op-ed. We ended up printing it in 
National Review or someplace online. 
Who wants to have a conversation 
about this stuff? 
The American people do. Everybody I 
talk to in Texas knows this is real. But 
here we are, and we have a House body 
and, frankly, an administration that is 
more interested in advancing wokeness 
every single day than addressing a wide 
open border that endangers us and the 
migrants who seek to come here. 
I can’t emphasize that enough: a wide 
open border that endangers American 
citizens, endangers our children, and 
endangers the migrants who seek to 
come here, which my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle pat themselves 
on the back in the false name of com-
passion that open borders is somehow 
good for migrants. And it is a lie. It is 
a blatant lie. 
Instead, what are we going to get? 
We are going to get a so-called infra-
structure bill next week, which will 
come through here on partisan lines. 
And what are we going to have in 
there? 
There are the provisions and pro-
grams that prioritize funding based on 
race, ethnicity, gender, and socially 
disadvantaged status. One provision, it 
finds that race and gender-neutral ef-
forts alone are insufficient. 
The bill includes a study on how Fed-
eral infrastructure planning exacer-
bated systemic racial, regional, social, 
environmental, and economic injus-
tices. 
We have a bill that establishes 41 new 
Federal programs, $20 million a year 
for implicit bias research and training 
grants related to racial profiling; $5 
million a year for a program to in-
crease transportation job awareness 
and diversity; a carbon pollution reduc-
tion program. 
On the international stage, what do 
we see? 
Our own diplomats are undermining 
the greatness of America. We have got 
Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the Ambas-
sador to the United Nations, who said 
that racial equity is her top focus, and 
that white supremacy is woven into 
our founding documents and principles. 
Our adversaries, like Russia and 
China, are weaponizing the leftist 
agenda. At the summit in Alaska, Sec-
retary Blinken brought up China’s im-
prisonment of millions of Uighur Mus-
lims, and China responded by arguing 
that the U.S. is not much different, 
mentioning Black lives matter. The 
Uighurs. 
Military and veterans: Instead of 
working to develop a lethal, battle- 
ready force that will kill people and de-
stroy things when called up to do so, 
which is the purpose of a military, 
under the guise of reviewing extremism 
within the ranks of the military in 
March, Special Operations Command 
hired its first chief diversity and inclu-
sion officer. 
We have seen examples of West Point 
cadets forced to attend critical race 
theory presentations. A Space Force 
officer was fired for saying, ‘‘The diver-
sity, inclusion and equity industry and 
the trainings we are receiving in the 
military . . . is rooted in critical race 
theory which is rooted in Marxism.’’ 
The Biden VA will now be using 
American taxpayer dollars to cover sex

I had multiple parents of the kids 
that I was able—or 18-year-olds I was 
able to nominate to go to academies, 
and we had a celebration in San Anto-
nio, and every single one of the parents 
were coming up to me and showing me 
these videos from the Air Force Acad-
emy, West Point Academy, talking 
about, you know, people having two 
moms and two dads and all of this 
woke training. For heaven’s sake, it is 
the military. 
I mean, China and Russia is just 
looking at us and saying: What in the 
world? Well, they are licking their 
chops. 
You have got critical race theory in 
education. We are seeing a large-scale 
effort to impose tyranny over the 
minds of our children through tax-
payer-funded indoctrination.

Whiteness,’’ which states that ‘‘white-
ness is a bad idea,’’ and ‘‘always was,’’ 
and that ‘‘you can be white without 
signing onto whiteness.’’ 
In Cupertino, California, third grad-
ers were required to deconstruct their 
racial identities and then rank them-
selves according to their ‘‘power and 
privilege.’’ 
In Oregon, ‘‘ethnic standards’’ will 
require kindergartners to ‘‘understand 
their own identity groups, including 
but not limited to race, gender, family, 
ethnicity, culture, religion, and abil-
ity.’’ 
An advisory board linked to Vir-
ginia’s Loudoun County Public School 
District demanded that teachers be dis-
missed if they criticize the district’s 
equity training, inspired by critical 
race theory. 
We saw the fellow who was removed 
or told that he had to be suspended in 
Loudoun County—I think he was fi-
nally restored—because he dared to 
speak up about this. 
Meanwhile, we have got woke cor-
porations all across America and their 
corporate boards moving the Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game from 
Atlanta, Georgia, which is 50 percent 
Black, to 10 percent Denver. I bet all of 
those White Coloradans driving around 
in their Subarus, patting themselves 
on the back when they go hiking with 
a rainbow flag on the back of their car 
or something, feel good about them-
selves, instead of celebrating Hank 
Aaron in Atlanta, Georgia. 
Why? 
Because Georgia was moving an elec-
tion reform bill with laws that were al-
most identical to Colorado. 
The Major League Baseball said: Oh, 
no, we are going to go join the woke 
brigade and we are going to go forward 
and we are going to move everything to 
Colorado. 
Nothing was proved by that other 
than 
Major 
League 
Baseball’s 
wokeness. 
I talked about border security be-
cause it is so critical to the people of 
Texas. We can talk about the other 
things that are critical, all of these 
programs I just talked about. 
People 
asked: 
Well, 
Congressman 
ROY, why do you come down here and 
often vote ‘‘no’’? 
Because every single bill dropped on 
the floor of this House spends money 
we don’t have, adds regulations that 
are going to kill small businesses, di-
vides us by race, or adds more laws to 
the books. 
Does anybody think we need more 
laws, more spending when we are $30 
trillion in debt? 
I just once would like to see an ac-
tual debate with the 435 Members rep-
resenting the American people in this 
Chamber about what in the world we 
are going to do about $30 trillion in 
debt. 
But we got nothing. We have got an 
empty Chamber. The American people 
can hear my voice echoing. We are not 
going to actually have a debate about 
it. We are just going to spend more 
money. It is just a race to see who can 
spend more money. 
Does anybody have any belief that we 
are not endangering our kids and 
grandkids? 
I mean, if somebody wants to come 
down here and expound on modern 
monetary theory about how spending 
all this money is absolutely fine, I am 
happy to listen. Most people in Amer-
ica don’t believe it. We will have $30 
trillion in debt soon; $6 trillion spent 
in the last year. 
Do you know how much it cost to win 
all of World War II? 
It was $4.1 trillion in current dollars. 
We just spent $6 trillion in a year— 
appropriated. We will spend it out in a 
little over a year; $6 trillion. 
We are shutting down small busi-
nesses, closing our schools. We have 
100,000 small businesses closed, 100,000. 
And now we are paying people more 
not to work than to work. 
Why do you suppose the Vice Presi-
dent of the United States refuses to 
come to the southern border? Why do 
you suppose the Vice President of the 
United States, or the President, refuses 
to go to the southern border and re-
fuses to take me up on my offer to de-
bate the Vice President anywhere, any 
time about the border? 
Because she knows and the President 
knows they have zero defense for our 
current border policies. There is lit-
erally no ability to defend the current 
border policies of the United States. It 
is laughable. A high school debate 
team would destroy the President or 
the Vice President in a debate about 
our current border because it is so un-
believably unforgivable to turn our 
borders over to cartels. 
But that is what this administration 
has done. And, again, look, it is all tied 
back together. This is all in the name 
of supposed compassion for people and 
a continued desire to try to drive a 
wedge and say: Oh, Republicans just 
don’t want those Brown people to come 
here across our river. That is what it is 
about. That is the purpose of the fight 
and the divide. 
Meanwhile, ask any Border Patrol 
agent, ask anybody along the Rio 
Grande, ask anybody who is being af-
fected by it, ask any of the migrants 
about what is happening, how it is hap-
pening, about the journey. I am not 
saying the migrants who come here 
don’t want to be here. They do. 
But look in the eyes of the little 7- 
year-old girl on the border that I 
looked into, who had no mom, no dad, 
no uncle, no aunt, no brother, no sister, 
nobody with her. But we don’t care. It 
is all fine. It is all fine for us to have 
a system in which a 7-year-old girl 
takes a journey by herself from Guate-
mala through Mexico in the hands of 
the cartels to get to our border. We say 
that is fine. 
b 2045 
I can’t state enough—and the reason 
I am using this time, and I went a lit-
tle longer than the time I thought I 
was going to use, is because my friend 
from Texas used a little more time, and 
I appreciated his being here. 
Every single person I talk to in Texas 
views this through the lens of an exis-
tential crisis, and yet it is absolute si-
lence from the administration and this 
body. 
People wonder why Governor Abbott 
is starting to say he is going to take it 
upon himself and the State to build a 
wall or to fund resources at the border. 
We have had to do it for years, by the 
way. Basically, a billion dollars a year, 
or at least per session, Texas has been 
funding technology. 
Do you know how often the Border 
Patrol is using technology funded by 
Texans? Cameras—because their Bor-
der Patrol cameras weren’t working— 
radios. Now the Governor is going 
down there saying he is going to do a 
lot of this, and Texas has got to figure 
out how to fund it. 
It is our border; they are our commu-
nities. Yet crickets, absolute crickets, 
devastating crickets, from the Demo-
crat-led House of Representatives and 
the Democrats in the White House, 
President Biden and Vice President 
Harris, who refuse to even come to the 
border. 
I don’t know, the longer this goes 
on—I get why the Vice President won’t 
go to the border. How can you look any 
American in the eye and say you are 
doing your constitutional duty to de-
fend the United States of America and 
secure our borders? 
Does anybody understand in this 
Chamber and comprehend how bad it is 
for our future and the future of our 
neighbors to the south to empower car-
tels the way we are empowering them? 
Instead of being able to compete with 
China, by having a robust free trade 
throughout the Western Hemisphere, 
to be able to have a strong Mexico that 
isn’t a narco-terror state, that we can 
partner with, that we can partner with 
countries 
throughout 
the 
Western 
Hemisphere and compete against China 
and not have this pressure valve com-
ing to our border; instead, we are dam-
aging these countries and empowering 
the narco-terror state in Mexico, em-
powering cartels, weakening our coun-
try, and endangering Americans. 
My friend from the House Judiciary 
Committee is here, and I am about to 
give my time up. I will give you a little 
warning here. In a couple of minutes, I 
am about to yield. 
I appreciate the work that he is 
doing, with my friend from Colorado, 
trying to navigate the complexity of 
antitrust laws with respect to the size 
of 
massive 
companies, 
particularly 
massive big tech companies. We are 
going to have a pretty robust day to-
morrow in the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. I do want to thank him, since 
we are here in the Chamber together, 
for the work that he is doing to try to 
address that. 
I don’t know if I will agree with 
every bill tomorrow. I know I am going

to support at least one or two. We will 
see what happens during the process of 
amending and debating. 
What I would say to my friend is that 
it would be great if we could address 
every issue with both sides of the aisle 
engaging and offering amendments and 
restore regular order so that we can try 
to get to the heart and the truth of 
these issues. 
We are never going to deal with our 
spending issues in this country if we 
don’t sit down and roll our sleeves up, 
like a family or small business has to 
do. We are never going to address 
something like the border if we don’t 
sit down and give and take and offer 
solutions that will work. We are never 
going to solve healthcare; we are never 
going to be able to have a strong na-
tional defense, without, by the way, 
being involved in endless conflicts. 
I joined with my Democrat friends 
last week on a measure involving our 
presence in Iraq. I think we can find 
agreement at times if we will sit down 
and do it. But we can’t bury our head 
in the sand and ignore existential cri-
ses and hope that they will just go 
away. 
I will just close by renewing my call 
to my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, the Vice President and the 
President. Let’s actually focus on these 
crises like the border, and let’s actu-
ally do our job and our constitutional 
duty to address them. Let’s actually do 
what we said we were going to do when 
we took our oaths to the Constitution 
of the United States, and we said we 
wanted to be a part of the people’s 
House to debate, to amend, to vote. 
I am not afraid of what we are going 
to do tomorrow. To my friend, we are 
going to offer bills, we are going to de-
bate, we are going to amend, and we 
are going to vote. We should do that on 
the floor of this House, Madam Speak-
er. We should do that on the floor of 
this House. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, to 
Mr. ROY, I look forward to our debate 
tomorrow and I think a good resolution 
on a number of important issues before 
the committee. 
Madam Speaker, I rise this evening 
to honor Pride Month. 
I want to begin by saying that we are 
grateful to the members of the Con-
gressional LGBTQ-plus Equality Cau-
cus, who continue to be champions for 
full equality for our community. 
Each year, we gather as a community 
in June to celebrate the progress that 
our community has made, that is the 
LGBTQ-plus community, and also to 
reflect on the work ahead and how 
much remains to be done. It is an op-
portunity each year to really celebrate 
the progress we have made and recom-
mit ourselves to the work that re-
mains. This year is no different. 
In 2021, we come together on the floor 
of this House to celebrate Pride Month 
with some very great highs and some 
very deep lows. Our community was 
deeply impacted by COVID, both be-
cause preexisting conditions added to 
people’s vulnerabilities, but also be-
cause segments of our population al-
ready face isolation, which was made 
even worse during the pandemic. 
Like all communities, we have been 
shocked at the efforts to undermine 
our democracy and restrict the right to 
vote, restrictions that we know will 
impact our community, particularly 
people of color, trans people, and those 
with disabilities. 
Of course, this year alone we wit-
nessed a historic number of anti- 
transgender 
laws 
being 
introduced 
around the country, many of them 
passing. Opponents of equality have de-
cided to zero in on the most vulnerable 
within our community, the community 
that is subject to the greatest amount 
of violence and the worst kind of dis-
crimination, and we must stand up in 
force against this. 
But it wouldn’t be Pride Month with-
out a celebration, and we have much to 
celebrate this year. 
In the last 6 months, Congress passed 
the NO HATE Act, which strengthens 
hate crimes reporting; we passed the 
Pulse Night Club Memorial bill. Now 
the Senate has passed it, and it goes to 
the President’s desk for his signature. 
In February, I proudly introduced 
H.R. 5, the Equality Act, with 224 origi-
nal cosponsors. It passed the House 
with 
bipartisan 
support. 
President 
Biden has challenged Congress to do 
everything in its power to get him the 
bill, get it to his desk for his signature. 
We are rolling up our sleeves to get 
the bill passed in the Senate. I am par-
ticularly proud that the House of Rep-
resentatives did its part in passing this 
critical piece of legislation. 
No American should be forced to live 
in fear of legal discrimination simply 
because of their sexual orientation or 
gender identity, and they certainly 
shouldn’t have to worry about whether 
or not the person in the White House or 
the State legislature will undermine 
what few protections they do have. 
The Equality Act is a commonsense 
piece of legislation that gets to the 
core issue of equality by expanding the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, and other ex-
isting laws, to ensure that LGBTQ 
Americans can live their lives free 
from discrimination. 
Equality is a founding principle of 
this great country, and I hope that by 
the time I stand before you for Pride 
Month next year, we will have turned 
this bill from a hope into a reality. 
I am very proud to have the support 
of so many Members of Congress and so 
many colleagues. In fact, every single 
Democrat is an original cosponsor of 
the Equality Act, including, of course, 
you, Madam Speaker. 
So I am proud to be a part of a cau-
cus that understands the fundamental 
importance of recognizing the dignity 
and value of every person, and Pride 
Month is about expressing that and af-
firming that to all LGBTQ-plus people 
all across this country and all across 
the world. 
Tonight, I am proud to have one of 
the co-chairs of the Equality Caucus, 
MARK TAKANO, Chairman of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, a member of 
the LGBTQ community, a very close 
friend, a deeply respected colleague, 
and a great champion for the equality 
of our community. 
I yield to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO) to share his views 
on the celebration of Pride. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my true friend from the State of 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE), who 
chairs the LGBTQ-plus Equality Cau-
cus, for his work. 
I want to say that Pride is always a 
very special time of year. It is a time 
of protest, a time of celebration, a time 
that we remember the struggles, honor 
the trailblazers, and appreciate the 
progress that we have made in the 
fight toward equality. 
Throughout our history, LGBTQ peo-
ple have been denied their basic rights. 
To this day, LGBTQ Americans across 
the country still face discrimination in 
key areas of life, from housing to 
healthcare. 
While the Supreme Court has ruled 
to expand nondiscrimination protec-
tions in employment and made mar-
riage equality the law of the land, in 29 
states LGBTQ people aren’t fully pro-
tected from discrimination. 
That is why we are working hard to 
get the Equality Act signed into law. 
Discrimination in this country has 
also been enshrined into policies at 
every level, including in the military. 
Despite this, thousands of brave 
LGBTQ Americans have still stepped 
up to serve our country in uniform. For 
decades, LGBTQ members of the U.S. 
military and veterans have faced dis-
crimination stemming from official 
military policies, including Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell and the Trans Military Ban. 
Before Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell became 
an official military policy, service-
members who were LGBTQ had to hide 
their identities, and those who were 
suspected of being LGBTQ were tar-
geted by horrendous and traumatizing 
so-called witch hunts, which stripped 
them of their dignity and mistreated 
them based on a suspicion that had 
nothing to do with their service. 
It is estimated that approximately 
114,000 servicemembers were discharged 
on the basis of their sexual orientation 
between World War II and 2011, while 
an estimated 870,000 LGBTQ veterans 
have been impacted by ‘‘hostility, har-
assment, assaultive behavior, and law 
enforcement targeting’’ by discrimina-
tory military policies. 
Many LGBTQ veterans who were dis-
charged on discriminatory grounds are

unable to access their VA benefits, and 
those still serving face inconsistent 
protections that make them vulnerable 
to harassment and put their careers at 
risk. 
But the true extent of the harm by 
discriminatory anti-LGBTQ policies in 
the military and at the VA is not 
known or well understood. To remedy 
the harm that has been done, we must 
reckon with the truth of what hap-
pened and understand the disparate ef-
fects of discriminatory military poli-
cies on LGBTQ people. 
That is why I have introduced the 
Commission to Study the Stigmatiza-
tion, Criminalization, and Ongoing Ex-
clusion and Inequity for LGBTQ Serv-
icemembers and Veterans Act, other-
wise known as the Commission on 
LGBTQ Servicemembers and Veterans 
Act. 
This legislation would launch a com-
prehensive study on the effects of dis-
criminatory military policies on af-
fected servicemembers, their families, 
and their units to help America learn 
the full extent of the harm caused by 
these policies and the status of protec-
tions 
for 
LGBTQ 
servicemembers 
today. 
There are currently 250,000 Active 
Duty LGBTQ servicemembers and more 
than 1.5 million LGBTQ veterans re-
ceiving healthcare from the VA. But 
there continues to be a pervasive lack 
of data collection on LGBTQ service-
members and veteran populations and 
an absence of education for both mem-
bers of the military and the general 
public about members of the LGBTQ 
community who serve in uniform. This 
legislation seeks to address that. 
It is essential for the American peo-
ple to hear stories of LGBTQ service-
members and veterans to understand 
the stigmatization they endured while 
serving our country and to know that, 
despite this, they are still immensely 
proud of their service. 
b 2100 
This month, I have been sharing pow-
erful stories of LGBTQ veterans on my 
social media. Every video testimonial 
reveals stories of bravery and profound 
love for country. It ends with veterans 
sharing the same message: LGBTQ peo-
ple want and deserve to serve, just like 
everyone else. 
We have, of course, made a lot of 
progress as a country, but there is still 
a lot of work that needs to be done to 
make the military and VA more inclu-
sive. It is my mission as co-chair of the 
Equality Caucus and chairman of the 
House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs 
to ensure that we honor the service of 
every American who has served, re-
gardless of their identity. 
This past weekend, we saw action 
that steers us toward that goal. The 
Biden administration announced that 
the VA will begin the first steps to ex-
pand care to include gender confirma-
tion surgery for transgender veterans. 
This is truly a first and incredibly sig-
nificant step that the VA is taking, 
and I applaud the VA’s decision. Vet-
erans in need of gender confirmation 
surgery 
should 
not 
have 
to 
seek 
healthcare 
outside 
of 
the 
VA 
healthcare system or navigate com-
plicated processes to get the care they 
need. 
This 
announcement 
will 
be 
life- 
changing for many, and it is the result 
of years of hard work and advocacy on 
behalf of trans veterans and allies. 
So in honor of Pride Month, we must 
keep up the momentum, honor all 
those who have served our country in 
uniform, and commit ourselves to cre-
ating a truly equal nation. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. TAKANO
for his powerful 
words. 
Now, Madam Speaker, I am honored 
to yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN), who has been a long-
standing member of the Equality Cau-
cus and who has always encouraged the 
celebration of Pride. For the last 8 
years, he has led the resolution in the 
House marking June as LGBTQ Pride 
Month. I want to thank him again and 
his office for his efforts, and I thank 
him for being with us this evening. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. And I rise tonight to 
continue to make my payments on a 
debt that I owe. 
I am the son of the segregated South. 
I know what invidious discrimination 
looks like. I know what it sounds like. 
I know what it tastes like. I know what 
it smells like. Because I have suffered 
invidious discrimination, I want no one 
else to suffer what I have suffered. 
I rise tonight to pay a debt because I 
didn’t get here by myself, and the peo-
ple who look like me, we didn’t get 
here by ourselves. Along the way there 
were people of different stripes who 
made a difference, such that we could 
have the opportunities that we have 
today. 
So I am proud to say that I am an 
ally of the LGBTQIA caucus. I am 
proud to say that I am a member of the 
congressional 
LGBTQ-plus 
Equality 
Caucus. And I am proud to say that Mr. 
CICILLINE is a person who I have great 
respect for, a person who is making a 
difference not only in the lives of peo-
ple who are a member of the commu-
nity, the LGBTQIA community, but 
also persons across the length and 
breadth of the globe, because when you 
help some directly, you help all indi-
rectly. 
I thank Mr. CICILLINE for this pre-
eminent privilege to stand tonight and 
to be a part of making the world a bet-
ter place for others. I desire, if I may, 
to continue. 
I want to make the world know that 
the caucus that I am a member of, the 
LGBTQ-plus Equality Caucus, has 170 
members. The caucus was formed in 
the 111th Congress. Today, we have in-
troduced the original LGBTQIA-plus 
Pride Month resolution. This resolu-
tion encourages the celebration of the 
month of June as LGBTQIA-plus Pride 
Month. It tracks the accomplishments 
and the milestones and the fight for 
LGBTQIA-plus equality. It has 187 co-
sponsors, minus the 100. It has 87 origi-
nal cosponsors. 
This resolution is endorsed by the 
National 
Center 
for 
Transgender 
Equality, PFLAG National, the Na-
tional LGBTQ Task Force, and the 
Transgender Foundation of America. 
We introduced the first LGBT Pride 
Month resolution in 2013. This resolu-
tion had 25 cosponsors. We have intro-
duced a Pride Month resolution in 
every Congress since 2013. 
In 2020, the LGBTQ Pride Month reso-
lution had 62 cosponsors. This year, the 
resolution has 87 original cosponsors. 
Now I would like to just discuss some 
seminal moments in Pride history. 
June marks 52 years of Pride celebra-
tions across the country. It was in 
June of 1970 that the first Pride march 
took place in New York City to com-
memorate Stonewall Inn, the site of an 
act of resistance in June of 1969. 
In 1977, Harvey Milk became the first 
openly gay elected public official in the 
U.S. 
In 1980, the Democratic Party became 
the first major American political 
party to endorse a gay rights platform. 
In 2000, Vermont became the first 
State to recognize civil unions between 
same-sex partners. 
In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 
sodomy laws unconstitutional. 
In November of 2003, the Massachu-
setts Supreme Justice Court ruled that 
preventing gays and lesbians from 
marrying violates the State constitu-
tion. 
In 2008, California voters passed prop-
osition 8, a public referendum ending 
same-sex marriage in the State. 
In 2009, Congress passed the Matthew 
Shepard Act, expanding hate crime 
laws to include acts motivated by a 
victim’s actual or perceived sexual ori-
entation or gender identity. 
Between 2009 and 2011, Vermont, 
Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire, the Dis-
trict of Columbia, and New York legiti-
mized same-sex marriage. 
In 2010, President Obama officially 
repealed Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, allow-
ing gays, bisexuals, and lesbians to 
serve openly in the military. 
In 2013, the Supreme Court struck 
down California’s proposition 8 and the 
Federal Defense of Marriage Act. 
On June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court 
ruled that the prohibition against sex 
discrimination laid out in title 7 of the 
1964 Civil Rights Act applied to LGBTQ 
Americans. 
Houston, Texas, has a history that 
we are proud of. We remember the up-
rising at Stonewall because it marked 
the beginning of a movement to outlaw 
discrimination and laws that prohib-
ited LGBTQIA persons from having the 
same rights as other persons in this 
country. Nearly a decade after the re-
sistance displayed in New York at 
Stonewall Inn, the gay rights move-
ment for equality made its way to 
Houston, Texas. 
Houston’s own Stonewall movement 
occurred in June of 1977, when thou-
sands gathered around city hall in

downtown Houston to protest an infa-
mous antigay activist who was per-
forming in Houston, Texas. According 
to OutSmart magazine, more than 4,000 
protesters marched around the Hyatt 
Regency Hotel, where the event was 
held. 
The first Houston Pride parade took 
place in June of 1978, along Westheimer 
Road; and more than four decades 
later, it has become the fourth largest 
Pride parade in the country.

This resolution that we have pre-
sented to the House today is one that 
we will continue to present. We will 
continue to present it because it is not 
only the right thing to do, but it is the 
righteous thing to do. 
No person in this country should be 
treated in such a way as to be defined 
as mistreated simply because of who 
they are. We have a right to be our-
selves, and we should never be put in a 
position such that it is perceived that 
being who you are is inappropriate in a 
country that extolls the virtues of lib-
erty and justice for all, that extolls the 
virtue of all persons being equal and 
endowed by their creator with certain 
inalienable rights, among them life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
In this country, every person ought 
to be proud to celebrate Pride Month. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his very elo-
quent words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ADAMS), a tireless advocate for women 
and historically Black colleges and 
universities, a member of the LGBTQ 
Equality Caucus, and an original co-
sponsor of the Equality Act. 
Ms. 
ADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his extraordinary work in this area. 
And I am a proud cosponsor of the 
Equality Act. 
Madam Speaker, I am ALMA ADAMS, 
and my pronouns are she, her, and hers. 
Tonight, I rise during Pride Month to 
honor some of the many LGBTQ elect-
ed officials who are working to make 
North Carolina a more equal and inclu-
sive State. 
Last week was Charlotte Black Pride 
Week, so I am happy to say that North 
Carolina’s 12th Congressional District, 
which I represent, is home to LaWana 
Mayfield, who made history in 2011 as 
Charlotte’s first openly gay elected of-
ficial. Since then, Al Austin and Billy 
Maddalon joined her as LGBT members 
of the Charlotte City Council. 
In Davidson, Jane Campbell, a retired 
captain in the United States Navy, 
serves on the Davidson Town Commis-
sion. And Charlotte’s John Arrowood 
made history as the first openly LGBT 
judge on North Carolina’s Court of Ap-
peals. 
All of these individuals put them-
selves forward for public service be-
cause they know that we can’t sleep on 
fairness and equal rights. And I am 
working hard as an ally in Congress, 
alongside members of my congressional 
office, supporting the LGBTQ commu-
nity, and I promise to continue to fight 
for their rights. 
I wish everyone across our country 
happy Pride. Now go forth and con-
tinue to fight because we can’t wait for 
equality; we have to win it. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend for her eloquent words 
and for being part of our Pride celebra-
tion here tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN), 
my new colleague who has been such 
an extraordinary, relentless advocate 
for our community. I know she does it 
on behalf of her child but also for chil-
dren all across America. 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative CICILLINE for or-
ganizing this Special Order tonight. It 
is so important. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise on be-
half of the millions of LGBTQ-plus 
Americans who, in 2021, are still fight-
ing for equality in our country. 
This year is already record-breaking 
for anti-trans legislation. Right now, a 
trans teenager in America is growing 
up in a country where there are 33 
States that have introduced more than 
100 bills that aim to curb their rights. 
The bills are not grounded in science. 
The bills are not grounded in fact. The 
lawmakers who have introduced them 
can’t even cite examples of any prob-
lem they are designed to solve. 
To put it simply, these bills are 
grounded in hate, and they are not only 
hateful but demoralizing and frus-
trating and agonizing, demoralizing to 
a population of our country that al-
ready suffers from high rates of depres-
sion, bullying, and suicide. 
In the United States, the lifetime de-
pression rate for the general popu-
lation is roughly 16.6 percent. For 
America’s transgender women, it is 62 
percent. Let that sink in. 
As a mother of a transgender daugh-
ter, I know firsthand how much this 
weighs on all of our brothers and sis-
ters. 
Young LGBTQ-plus Americans need 
somewhere to turn to for help because 
most of them don’t have someone to 
turn to. That is true. 
In Illinois, we have a 24/7 youth hot-
line that supports students in crisis 
and engages trusted adults in their 
community. Bullying and threats of 
suicide are the two most common re-
ports through the line. This resource 
has saved countless lives in Illinois. 
But not every State has one of these. 
That is why I will be introducing legis-
lation to support States’ youth mental 
health and safety helplines and to help 
States develop these resources if they 
don’t yet have one. 
These resources are particularly crit-
ical for young Americans who are at a 
higher risk for bullying and suicide, 
such as those who belong to the 
LGBTQ-plus community. 
While I continue to urge the Senate 
to pass the Equality Act, I also want to 
urge this entire body to work together 
so we can do more to support our 
LGBTQ-plus Americans. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for being part 
of this Pride Special Order and for her 
incredible advocacy on behalf of our 
community, particularly her heroic 
work on behalf of the transgender com-
munity. It is making a real difference. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS), a new colleague and 
someone who has been an extraor-
dinary advocate for the LGBT commu-
nity, a great ally for our caucus. He is 
a member of the LGBTQ-plus Equality 
Caucus, an original cosponsor of the 
Equality Act, and a really powerful 
voice in our fight for equality. 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
as we celebrate Pride Month, I rise to 
recognize my constituent, my friend, 
Newton City Councilor Holly Ryan. 
Councilor Ryan is a long-serving activ-
ist in my district and my hometown. 
She is the first openly transgender 
woman to serve on a city council in 
Massachusetts and the first openly 
LGBTQ-plus person to serve on the 
Newton City Council. 
Holly is a distinguished champion of 
equality, serving as the founding mem-
ber and former co-chair of the Massa-
chusetts Transgender Political Coali-
tion. Her advocacy led to the passage 
of both the 2011 trans rights law and 
the 2016 public accommodation law, en-
suring that no one in the Common-
wealth can face discrimination because 
of gender identity. 
I was fortunate to serve with Coun-
cilor Ryan on the city council before 
coming to Congress. Councilor Ryan is 
a trailblazer, paving the way for a 
more equal future. Massachusetts is 
better off thanks to her accomplish-
ments. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for participating 
in our Special Order and for being such 
a great ally to our community. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE), a distinguished senior member of 
the Judiciary Committee, someone who 
has long been a champion of justice 
and equality, a great ally to the 
LGBTQ community, an original co-
sponsor of the Equality Act, and a 
member of the LGBTQ Equality Cau-
cus. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my dear friend and courageous 
leader who brought us all together so 
many years ago and, I believe, built up 
the Equality Caucus into such an effec-
tive spokesperson for all of those who 
are voiceless in many instances. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
DAVID 
CICILLINE. I remember the journey he 
made on the Equality Act. It was a lot 
of meetings, a lot of engagement, but 
he brought us all together. I am very 
proud to be an original cosponsor and 
one that gave insight into the neces-
sity for that legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3001 
June 22, 2021 
Let me say the very obvious, and 
that is happy Pride Month. It is an im-
portant statement for America, and it 
is about Americans. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
these 
statistics 
from Texas would give you just a 
bird’s-eye view of what our State is 
like: percent of adults who are LGBTQ- 
plus, 4.1 percent; total LGBTQ-plus 
population, 1,053,000 and, of course, 
growing; the workforce, 5 percent. 
b 2120 
Those who are workers, 647,000; and 
the LGBTQ-plus, adults raising chil-
dren, 29 percent—just regular Texans, 
regular Americans. That is why we 
stand on the floor of the House today 
to be able to celebrate Pride Month. 
And though many of the occasions we 
have had in Houston and around the 
Nation are virtual, we are still making 
our voices heard. 
We look forward in Houston to our 
big Pride Parade, and, of course, we 
look forward to recommitting our-
selves to making equality in every as-
pect of American life real for members 
of the LGBTQ community. 
We have a shared struggle, a collec-
tive joy that is found in the history of 
that struggle and life experiences that 
are unique. Unique because individuals 
have that experience of the LGBTQ- 
plus. Experiences that many of us have 
not had, but experiences that some-
times ground themselves in unfair dis-
crimination. 
Mr. CICILLINE, I heard a Member on 
the floor just a few minutes ago indi-
cate how he wanted to amend the 
Juneteenth legislation. He was sorry 
he could not amend it. And I was 
thinking to myself, well, my friend, we 
have been trying to amend it, establish 
it, declare it, for 156 years, since the 
Emancipation Proclamation, the sec-
ond time around in 1865, in Galveston. 
And we waited too long. And I would 
say that we have been fighting for jus-
tice for this community, starting with 
Stonewall in Greenwich Village, and I 
would say that we could not wait any 
longer. That was an enormous moment 
of rising up for your own dignity and 
freedom and a watershed moment in 
the LGBTQ movement, reigniting the 
fight for justice and signaling a new 
chapter of progress in our country’s 
quest to ensure that fair treatment is 
the rule, never the exception. 
We appreciate the Supreme Court’s 
decision in the fight to respect same- 
sex couples’ right to marry—that took 
a long time—and to love. Our country’s 
commitment to justice has been main-
tained by the tireless work of advo-
cates. 
I had been here during the Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell, and just the enormous pride 
when that was removed from the 
United States military under President 
Obama’s administration. The audito-
rium was standing room only as that 
was signed to ensure that it never 
would happen again. 
This a social movement, enshrined 
with truth and belief, and the basis of 
creating all of us worthy of human dig-
nity. 
In keeping with this belief, we cannot 
forget the great champions of my great 
State, who have been proud Texans, 
who have not been afraid, even in the 
climate that we live: Sara Fernandez, 
Judy Reed, Tommie Ross, JD Doyle, 
Dalton 
DeHart, 
Judge 
Jerry 
Simoneaux, and Judge Fran Watson. 
But, also, our senior stateswoman, and 
that is our former mayor, Annise 
Parker, who led the cause for the sta-
tus of LGBTQ in our community. We 
thank you, former Mayor Parker. 
We thank you for the fight of equal-
ity, though we did not make it in this 
city when we tried to do an ordinance 
to indicate that bathrooms were not 
important and no one in this commu-
nity should be characterized as attack-
ing anyone but just wanting freedom 
and justice. 
I would like to recognize a few orga-
nizations that continue to do great 
work: The Houston GLBT Political 
Caucus, 
Save 
Our 
Sisters 
United, 
Montrose Grace Place in the Montrose 
Center—many of these were pioneers in 
doing the work that was so important. 
Madam Speaker, I am reminded of 
the Ryan White Treatment Act. As a 
member of the Houston City Council, I 
was honored to be the only Member of 
Congress that came from Houston, 
Texas, to stand by Ryan White and his 
family here in the United States Con-
gress with the late former Senator Ted 
Kennedy and Senator Orrin Hatch, the 
two cosponsors; stand right next to 
him in a sweaty, very small room. I am 
not sure why they selected that small 
room. They must have believed that we 
were not coming from everywhere to 
witness this historic moment of the 
Ryan White Treatment Act and to 
meet Ryan White at that time. It was 
an amazing recognition at that time of 
the need for AIDS treatment. 
But sadly to say, I sat by the bedside 
of many of my constituents whose fam-
ilies would not acknowledge that they 
had HIV/AIDS, and they died alone. 
What a moment that we lived through. 
So many died; so many alone, except 
for friends who would be willing to be 
by their bedside. We have come a 
mighty long way. 
Madam Speaker, very quickly, as I 
close, that honor continues to go to 
those who continue to fight. My meet-
ing with Matthew Shepard’s mother, of 
sitting with her in my office when we 
talked about the Matthew Shepard 
Act, and being so proud for her to in-
clude me in her book. How heinous to 
lose your son in that way. How many 
parents have had to face that? 
But again, I pay tribute to Monica 
Roberts in Houston, who leaves a gap-
ing hole in the hearts of the LGBTQ- 
plus community. Monica worked as a 
trailblazing journalist and advocate, 
never failing to censure the stories of 
Black trans people and shining the 
light on the issues of those often ig-
nored. 
We intend to introduce legislation 
dealing with the sizeable number of 
murders against Black trans persons— 
mostly women. Ray Hill co-organized 
the first gay rights organization in 
Houston in 1967, fiercely advocating for 
those living with HIV and AIDS. 
And so the more than 46,000 same-sex 
couples in Texas, a third of them 
LGBTQ Texans, who are raising chil-
dren. This is a new day, but our work 
for justice has not ended. 
We thank the Williams Institute of 
the UCLA School of Law. Approxi-
mately 900,000 Texans identify as les-
bian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. 
And maybe one day my State will rec-
ognize the fullness of the equality of 
all. Thank goodness for the H.R. 5, 
Equality Act, that covers Texas as 
well. 
Madam Speaker, in my third clos-
ing—with a little bit of humor—but 
with all seriousness, I wanted to make 
sure that I added to this RECORD the 
Texas Tribune article, ‘‘Texas law-
makers advance bills blocking access 
to gender-affirming healthcare despite 
opposition from LGBTQ Texans, med-
ical associations,’’ directly impacting 
17-year-old Indigo Giles, who was able 
to get surgery before this law, now 19. 
Madam Speaker, ending the depres-
sion that they faced, ending the at-
tacks that they felt, feeling more com-
fortable in their skin—that is what 
this month is all about, saying to 
them, saying to America: We are pride 
and we are proud. And we stand to-
gether 
as 
an 
extended 
family 
of 
LGBTQ-plus and all of those who, 
frankly, recognize that our freedom is 
intertwined with your freedom. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her really 
eloquent words and for being such a 
good ally for our community for so 
long. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
SCANLON), an education and voting 
rights advocate, an original cosponsor 
of the Equality Act, vice-chair of the 
Equality Caucus here in the House, and 
an extraordinary champion for our 
community. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague, Rep-
resentative CICILLINE, for organizing 
this Special Order hour and for his 
leadership in introducing and passing 
the Equality Act, and I look forward to 
it being signed into law. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in rec-
ognition of Pride Month and to cele-
brate the rich history of LGBTQ activ-
ism in the greater Philadelphia area. 
In 1965, years before the Stonewall 
uprising, protestors borrowed from the 
tactics of the civil rights movement 
and staged a sit-in at Dewey’s lunch 
counter in Philadelphia in opposition 
to its policy of refusing service to ‘‘ho-
mosexuals,’’ 
‘‘masculine 
women,’’ 
‘‘feminine men,’’ and ‘‘persons wearing 
non-conforming clothing.’’ Can you 
imagine what they would think today? 
Philadelphia is home to this—the 
first and oldest LGBTQ bookstore in 
the United States—Giovanni’s Room,

as well as Philadelphia Gay News, the 
oldest 
LGBTQ 
publication 
in 
the 
United States. As early as 1981, activ-
ists were meeting with the local De-
partment of Public Health to discuss 
the virus that would eventually be-
come known as AIDS and put pressure 
on them to address this growing crisis. 
In more recent history, Amber Hikes, 
in the City’s Office of LGBT Affairs in-
troduced a more inclusive Pride flag in 
2017, adding black and brown stripes to 
represent LGBTQ people of color. 
Today, 
activism 
within 
Philadel-
phia’s LGBTQ community continues 
through groups like the William Way 
Community Center, and people like my 
friend, Kendall Stephens, who is push-
ing for Pennsylvania to update its hate 
crime statute to finally include LGBTQ 
people as a protected class. 
From early protests to the continued 
advocacy of today, the Philadelphia re-
gion has plenty to be proud of during 
Pride Month. 
b 2130 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for being part 
of this Special Order hour tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. JA-
COBS), a colleague on the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee, someone who has 
dedicated her work, even before she got 
to Congress, to ending childhood pov-
erty to the promotion of human rights 
and equality. She is an original cospon-
sor of the Equality Act, a member of 
the LGBTQ Equality Caucus, and a 
great advocate for our community. We 
are delighted she is with us this 
evening. 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. CICILLINE
for 
yielding to me. 
I am honored to join my colleagues 
tonight to mark Pride Month. I should 
know note, San Diego actually offi-
cially celebrates Pride in July. So I am 
happy I get an extra month to cele-
brate with all of you. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today 
as the proud sister to a trans brother 
and a gender nonconforming sibling; a 
proud member of the LGBTQ Equality 
Caucus; and the proud representative 
of Hillcrest, the heart and soul of San 
Diego’s diverse and vibrant LGBTQ- 
plus community. 
This year has been difficult for so 
many of us, but especially for the 
LGBTQ-plus 
community. 
COVID–19 
took friends, family members, and be-
loved community leaders from us. It 
forced so many into isolation; closed 
our communal spaces; and added to the 
economic, 
mental 
health, 
physical 
health, and childcare burdens. 
And to all of the young people stuck 
at home, away from their friends, and 
may be with family who doesn’t accept 
you, know this: You are perfect just 
the way you are and we need you. 
But 
during 
this 
pandemic, 
San 
Diego’s LGBTQ-plus community also 
rallied together to support one another 
and to support our community at 
large. The San Diego LGBTQ Commu-
nity Center hosted food banks and 
made home deliveries for folks who 
were homebound. San Diego Pride 
hosted vaccine events for LGBTQ-plus 
people of color, trans, and non-binary 
people, and those living with HIV. 
And next month, at long last, we will 
finally be able to celebrate Pride to-
gether again in person. And as we cele-
brate, we are also focused on the fu-
ture. I am proud to work alongside all 
our LGBTQ-plus siblings to fight for an 
end to discrimination in all its forms 
based on sex, sexual orientation, and 
gender identity. 
Earlier this year, I was honored to 
join every one of my Democratic col-
leagues as an original cosponsor of the 
Equality Act, legislation that will be 
life-changing for so many of my con-
stituents. 
The first version of this bill was filed 
15 years before I was even born. It had 
one cosponsor and never got a vote. It 
is 
humbling 
to 
think 
about 
the 
progress that has happened in my life-
time, progress that was made possible 
by all those who marched and pro-
tested and raised their voices. I am 
proud to work alongside all of you to 
continue that work. We will keep up 
the fight until everyone has equal 
rights under the law. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for being part 
of this Special Order hour and for her 
great support of the LGBTQ-plus com-
munity. 
Madam Speaker, before I end, I just 
want to recognize Annise Parker. I also 
want recognize Barney Frank, Jared 
Polis, our former colleagues who have 
served in this House. And now Gov-
ernor Polis is the Governor of Colo-
rado. TAMMY
BALDWIN
and KYRSTEN 
SINEMA in the United States Senate. 
SEAN PATRICK MALONEY, MARK POCAN, 
ANGIE CRAIG, SHARICE DAVIDS, MARK 
TAKANO, 
CHRIS
PAPPAS, 
MONDAIRE 
JONES, and RITCHIE TORRES, who are 
current Members of Congress. There 
are nine LGBTQ Members in the House 
and two in the Senate. So 11 Members 
in total. 
And part of the reason we celebrate 
Pride is to send a message to the entire 
community, but especially to young 
people who may be struggling with 
their sexual orientation or their gender 
identity. Pride is a moment for us to 
say: You are valued. We celebrate you. 
We honor you. You have a right like 
every other American to be treated 
with dignity and respect. You are hear-
ing that from the floor of the United 
States House of Representatives, where 
nine Members of our community serve 
openly and honestly, and two Members 
in the Senate. 
Let that be a message to every young 
person, every family struggling with 
the issues of sexual orientation or gen-
der identity, that they are heard, they 
are valued, they are affirmed and re-
spected. 
Happy Pride Month.

ance of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, Act 77 
was passed in 2019 by the Pennsylvania 
State legislature when Republicans 
held the majority in both houses. 
Among other voting reforms, the bill 
provided for no-excuse absentee voting 
and extended registration deadlines. 
At the time, Republicans in the State 
legislature were operating under the 
assumption that mail-in voting would 
boost participation among seniors, who 
tend to lean Republican. Every single 
Republican State senator voted for the 
bill. In the State house, 105 Pennsyl-
vania Republicans voted for the bill 
and 2 voted no. That was 2019. 
Fast forward to 1 year later. Donald 
Trump, fresh off a resounding loss from 
the 2020 Presidential election, cried 
foul and lied—lied—that the election 
was stolen from him, like a petulant 
child. One of his favorite bugaboos, as 
we all know, was mail-in voting. 
So a little over a year after 132 Penn-
sylvania Republicans voted for Act 77 
with only two against, they introduced 
a bill to, you guessed it, repeal Act 77, 
a law that Republicans passed while 
they were in the majority just a year 
before. 
There is a rot—a rot—at the center of 
the modern Republican Party. Donald 
Trump’s Big Lie has spread like a can-
cer and threatens to envelope one of 
America’s major political parties. Even 
worse, it has poisoned our democracy 
and eroded faith in our elections, which 
is so detrimental to the future faith 
people need to have in this democracy. 
And, of course, it became the match 
that lit a wildfire of Republican voter 
suppression laws sweeping across the 
country. Because of one man’s lie, Re-
publicans are now doing the dastardly 
act of taking away voting from mil-
lions of Americans—millions of Ameri-
cans—and making it much harder for 
them to vote, and many, many, many 
will not. 
From Georgia to Montana, from 
Florida to Iowa, in 14 different States, 
through 22 different laws, Republican 
State legislatures are conducting the 
most coordinated voter suppression ef-
fort in 80 years. And as the example of 
Act 77 in Pennsylvania goes to show, 
there is no principle behind these laws: 
not fraud, not election integrity, not 
security, not better election adminis-
tration. The only principle is blatant 
partisan electoral advantage aimed at

June 22, 2021 
people of color, young people, urban 
people, and people who vote Demo-
cratic. It has nothing to do with fraud. 
They haven’t pointed out that there is 
more fraud in those areas than in other 
areas. It is just blatant, blatant par-
tisan advantage. 
Whatever 
voting 
changes 
Repub-
licans think are good for them, they 
will make them, even if it means re-
sorting to the awful and un-American 
act of voter suppression. So in State 
after State—State after State—Repub-
licans are reducing polling hours and 
locations and the number of drop boxes 
so that Americans of all parties, but 
particularly aimed at Democratic vot-
ers, people of color, young people, poor 
people, have a harder time finding the 
time, place, and manner to vote. 
They are limiting the kind of IDs you 
can use, like student IDs, while at the 
same time removing requirements of 
any form of licensing to own a firearm. 
Has any study shown that there is less 
fraud among firearm owners than stu-
dents? There is probably very little 
among either, but they pick one group 
and not the other, and we know why. 
Republican legislatures are making 
it easier to own a gun than to vote. Re-
publican legislatures are making it 
harder to vote early, harder to vote by 
mail, and harder to vote after work. 
They are making it a crime to give 
food or water to voters waiting in long 
lines. They are trying to make it hard-
er for Black churchgoers to vote on 
Sunday. And they are actually making 
it easier for unelected judges and par-
tisan election boards to overturn the 
results of an election, opening the door 
for some demagogue, a Trumpian-type 
demagogue—maybe he himself—to try 
and subvert our elections in the very 
same way that Trump tried to do it in 
2020. 
Republicans say these laws are about 
‘‘election integrity.’’ They claim they 
are only trying to ‘‘secure the vote.’’ 
Some of my friends here in Washington 
have resorted to the old refrain that 
election laws are best left to the 
States, ignoring the fact that for gen-
erations, we, in Congress, have passed 
Federal election laws and constitu-
tional amendments to prevent exactly 
this kind of discrimination and voter 
suppression. 
We all know what these laws are 
about. I daresay my Republican col-
leagues know. They are not stupid. 
When the State of Texas proposes to 
limit voting hours on Sunday to only a 
few hours in the evening, do they real-
ly believe that is about preventing 
fraud? Do my Senate friends want to 
back up that kind of thing, prevent it 
from even being talked about here on 
the floor of the Senate? When Georgia 
Republicans say it is a crime to give a 
voter some water or food as they wait 
in line on a hot day, do they really 
think they are preventing voter fraud 
by denying them a snack? Give me a 
break. Give me a break. 
Republicans across the country are 
deliberately targeting all the ways 
that younger, poorer, non-White, and 
typically Democratic voters access the 
ballot. Republicans claim they are 
making it easier to vote and harder to 
cheat in an election. In reality, they 
are making it harder to vote and easier 
to cheat in an election, and we all 
know it. 
And all we want to do here is debate 
it in regular order—regular order— 
which colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle have asked for. That is what we 
are asking for here, just to debate 
these things, and they won’t even do 
that because they are so afraid of what 
that debate will show: that this is not 
election integrity; that this is voter 
suppression and voter suppression di-
rected at only one group of voters. 
Well, we are going to see what hap-
pens today. Later today, the entire 
country will see whether our Repub-
lican friends are willing to even debate 
this issue in broad daylight. This after-
noon, the U.S. Senate will vote on a 
motion to proceed to voting rights leg-
islation. We all know what a motion to 
proceed is around here, but let me ex-
plain it. All it says is let’s go forward 
with debate. Let’s debate something, 
and this is among the most important 
things we could ever debate, the right 
to vote—what our soldiers have died 
for and what peaceful marchers have 
been bloodied for, the right to vote. 
It takes 60 votes to start that debate. 
Everyone knows you still need 60 votes 
to end the debate on a bill. So even if 
the Republicans don’t like the legisla-
tion at the end of the process, let them 
vote against it then. But, no, they 
don’t even want to debate it. They 
don’t even want to debate it because 
they are afraid. They want to deny the 
right to vote, make it harder to vote 
for so many Americans, and then they 
don’t want to talk about it, sweep it 
under the rug, and hope that Ameri-
cans don’t hear about it. 
But Americans will hear about it. We 
are going to make sure of that, and 
millions in the country who are rightly 
and correctly outraged by what is hap-
pening will let everyone know what has 
happened. 
Now, only by starting the process can 
Senators offer amendments, change the 
bill, forge compromise. Only then can 
Senators engage in a full-throated de-
bate about what this Chamber should 
do about the assault on voting rights in 
this country. Obviously, there are ar-
guments about what should be done to 
protect voting rights and safeguard our 
democracy. Obviously, there are argu-
ments about which policies are the 
most effective. But shouldn’t we at 
least agree to debate the issue? 
That is the only question for the U.S. 
Senate today. Do my Republican col-
leagues believe that voting rights, the 
most fundamental in a democracy, the 
right that generations of Americans 
have marched for and protested to 
achieve, that generations of American 
soldiers have fought and died to secure, 
is that worthy of debate? Of course it 
is. 
Should the U.S. Senate even debate 
how to protect the voting rights of our 
citizens? There is only one correct an-
swer. We will see if our Republican col-
leagues choose it this afternoon. 
This is not simply a partisan issue, 
as partisan as the Republican side and 
the State legislatures and now here in 
the Senate seem to make it. It is about 
the fundamental values in this coun-
try. It is about what we are all about. 
When the Constitution was started in 
most States, you had to be a White 
male Protestant property owner to 
vote. There has been an inexorable 
march to expand that right to vote and 
allow more and more Americans to 
have that right to vote. This is a giant 
step backward. Obviously, it is a par-
tisan issue to the Republicans, but it is 
a much deeper issue than that. 
Will our colleagues stand up for what 
generations of Americans have fought 
for, marched for, and died for or will 
they just slink away and say we are 
not even going to debate this? 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
IRAN 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
over the weekend, Iran held what its 
Supreme Leader might call a Presi-
dential election. To the rest the world, 
including millions of Iranians, what ac-
tually happened was quite clear. The 
regime’s favored choice was selected 
from a limited field of approved can-
didates in a carefully controlled bit of 
political theater. There is no doubt 
this charade works as intended. The 
Ayatollah got a President-elect with a 
record of strict adherence to his re-
gime’s revolutionary orthodoxy. Mean-
while, former Presidential candidates 
who emerged as leaders in the popular 
2009 Green Movement remain under 
house arrest. Like his predecessors, 
Ebrahim Raisi will serve as a figure-
head while the Supreme Leader and the 
Islamic Revolutionary Guard actually 
run the show. 
But even rigged elections have con-
sequences, and the new most visible 
figure in Tehran has a proven history 
as a hardline theocrat. For decades, 
from his time on a so-called death com-
mittee in the 1980s, the President-elect 
played an intimate role in the trial, 
conviction, and summary execution of 
political prisoners and peaceful pro-
testers. There is no question he is an 
extreme hardliner, even in the Iranian 
context, and now he is set to be the so- 
called counterpart to President Biden 
as this administration reengages ea-
gerly with the world’s most active 
state sponsor of terrorism. 
In some circles, a looming turnover 
in the top ranks of Iranian leadership 
is being spun as a reason for the White 
House to rush even faster than it al-
ready is toward restoring the Obama 
administration’s failed nuclear deal. 
One particularly eager assessment in 
the New York Times called the next 6

weeks ‘‘a unique window for clinching 
an agreement,’’ like some sort of liq-
uidation sale in which President Biden 
needs to take whatever he can. Mean-
while, rational observers know that the 
fundamental reality of the U.S.-Iranian 
relations certainly has not changed. 
If the selection of a new hardline fig-
urehead in Tehran sends any signal, it 
is a reminder that showering the re-
gime with sanctions relief and expect-
ing a change in behavior is a reckless 
and damaging approach. In fact, Presi-
dent-elect Raisi has already said as 
much himself. Iran’s ballistic missile 
program is ‘‘not negotiable,’’ and meet-
ing with President Biden is not on the 
table. 
Of course, Iranian politicians and 
diplomats are known to lie and to dis-
semble, so we should pay closest atten-
tion to this regime’s actions. What will 
it actually do? 
Here is the truth: Domestic political 
developments in Tehran don’t absolve 
the Biden administration of its respon-
sibility to confront Iran’s nuclear and 
missile proliferation, its support for 
terrorism, its abuses of human rights, 
and its relentless efforts to destabilize 
the entire region. 
If President Biden hopes to earn bi-
partisan support for an Iran policy that 
could outlast his time in office, he 
needs to start explaining how he in-
tends to respond as Iran ramps up 
threats against the United States and 
our closest partners in its backyard. 
Remember, the thousands of rockets 
Hamas fired at Israel last month were 
made possible by Iran. So were the pre-
cision-guided munitions in Hezbollah’s 
arsenal and the ballistic missiles and 
UAVs launched into Saudi Arabia by 
the Houthis in Yemen. And the dozens 
of militia attacks on U.S. interests in 
Iraq? Carried out by Tehran’s reliable 
accolades. 
The Biden administration has had 
months to develop a coherent rationale 
for its eager engagement with the Ira-
nian regime and months to hash out a 
better plan than rewarding terrorist 
sponsors with sanctions relief. An ex-
planation to Congress is long overdue. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. President, now on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, later today, the Senate 
will vote on whether to advance Demo-
crats’ transparently partisan plan to 
tilt every election in America perma-
nently in their favor. 
By now, the rotten inner workings of 
this power grab have been thoroughly 
exposed to the light. We know that it 
would shatter a decades-old under-
standing that campaign law should 
have a bipartisan referee and turn the 
Federal Election Commission into a 
partisan majority cudgel for Demo-
crats to wield against their political 
opponents. We know that it would let 
Washington bureaucrats direct Federal 
dollars into politicians’ campaign ac-
counts—government money for yard 
signs and attack ads. We know that it 
would let Democrats take a red pen to 
election laws in each of the 50 States, 
neutering 
popular 
precautions 
like 
voter ID while legalizing shady prac-
tices like ballot harvesting across the 
board. 
It is a recipe for undermining con-
fidence in our elections, for remaking 
our entire system of government to 
suit the preferences of one far end of 
the political spectrum. And if they 
could, many Democrats would pass it 
with the slimmest possible majority, 
even after its companion faced bipar-
tisan opposition over in the House. 
What a craven political calculation. 
What a way to show your disdain for 
the American people’s choices. 
Of course, it isn’t even limited to 
election law. Among the most dan-
gerous parts of S. 1 is the way it would 
equip partisan regulators to intimidate 
and to discourage private citizens from 
engaging in political speech. 
Unfortunately, this one is a familiar 
concept for too many Americans. It is 
not hard to imagine Federal bureau-
crats indulging ideological grudges and 
chilling free speech. It has actually 
happened before. The Nation was re-
minded just a few weeks ago how un-
able the Federal Government can be to 
protect private citizens’ personal infor-
mation—unable or just unwilling? 
But 
conservatives 
in 
particular 
didn’t need a reminder of what became 
institutionalized discrimination under 
the last Democratic administration. So 
when private contributors, nonprofit 
advocacy groups, and religious organi-
zations see that S. 1’s disclosure re-
quirements 
would 
intentionally 
unlearn the lessons of the IRS’s abuses 
under Lois Lerner, they have plenty of 
reasons—plenty—to fear. 
Naming and shaming is not a hypo-
thetical concept; it has been a concrete 
reality for thousands of private citi-
zens. Today, Democrats are asking for 
a green light to supercharge the in-
timidation machine that makes all 
that possible. 
We have heard this entire package 
described in many ways over the years. 
It has been around for a while. The 
same rotten proposals have sometimes 
been called a massive overhaul for a 
broken democracy, sometimes just a 
modest package of tweaks for a democ-
racy that is working perfectly, and 
sometimes a response to State actions, 
which this bill actually predates by 
many 
years. 
But 
whichever 
label 
Democrats slap on the bill, the sub-
stance remains the same. It has always 
been a plan to rewrite the ground rules 
of American politics. 
By the way, no matter what far-left 
activists are telling our colleagues, 
this most sensitive subject would not 
be the best place to trash the Senate’s 
rules to ram something through. In 
fact, these issues would be the worst 
possible place to push through a power 
grab at any cost. 
The Senate is no obstacle to voting 
laws done the right way. I have helped 
write legislation regarding our democ-
racy that has soared through this 
Chamber on huge bipartisan margins. 
The Senate is only an obstacle when 
the policy is flawed and the process is 
rotten, and that is exactly why this 
body exists. 
Today, the Senate is going to fulfill 
our founding purpose, stop the partisan 
power grab, and reject S. 1. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, what 
is the status of the floor? 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senate is considering the 
Fonzone nomination. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as if in 
morning business. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, let’s 
be clear. We are facing the most dan-
gerous and overt threat to our demo-
cratic system in generations. 
Supreme Court decisions like Citi-
zens United and McCutcheon wrongly 
equated money with speech, and in the 
decades 
since, 
unaccountable 
dark 
money has flooded into our political 
system. This broken campaign finance 
system allows billionaires to drown out 
the voices of ordinary Americans with 
no accountability. This lack of trans-
parency also opens the door for dan-
gerous disinformation campaigns. 
After the Supreme Court gutted arti-
cle V of the Voting Rights Act in an-
other terrible decision, we have also 
seen State legislatures across the coun-
try take up and pass voting laws de-
signed explicitly to prevent Black, 
Brown, and young voters from exer-
cising their right to vote. 
These new laws in States like Geor-
gia, Arizona, and Texas are right out of 
the pre-Voting Rights Act playbook of 
the Jim Crow South. Some have called 
them Jim Crow 2.0, and, frankly, it is 
hard to disagree. They make it harder 
to register to vote. They reduce early 
voting times in polling locations. They 
restrict access to vote by mail. In the 
Presiding Officer’s State in Georgia, it 
is now illegal to hand out water to 
someone who has been standing in line 
for hours to vote, waiting to vote. 
Could anything be more wrongheaded? 
My home State of New Mexico is a 
good example of what it looks like to 
enhance rather than attack participa-
tion in our democracy. I am proud of 
the ways that election officials in my 
State have stepped up in recent years 
to make voting safer, to make it more 
secure and at the same time more ac-
cessible for every New Mexican, and 
our State has seen greater participa-
tion in our elections as a result. Now, 
unfortunately, we are seeing the polar 
opposite of this approach in our neigh-
boring States. 
Just last week, Democratic law-
makers from Texas came to Wash-
ington, DC, to warn us just how dire 
the situation has become in their 
State. Texas’s Governor, Greg Abbott, 
and Republican lawmakers in Austin 
are hell-bent on passing sweeping vot-
ing restrictions as part of a nakedly

discriminatory power grab. These pro-
posed changes would reduce voting 
hours, push back the start of Sunday 
early voting when many Black voters 
cast their ballots, and eliminate poll-
ing locations in larger urban counties. 
The goal of this type of legislation is 
pretty plain to see. 
This shameful and transparent at-
tempt to take away Texans’ right to 
vote and similar attempts to disenfran-
chise voters in many other States 
should be a wake-up call to every sin-
gle American. We should all be able to 
see that these attacks on voting are 
taking advantage of and in many cases 
being driven by our former President’s 
lies and conspiracy theories about the 
last election. 
Make no mistake, former President 
Trump’s Big Lie about his loss in the 
2020 election has sown widespread and 
damaging distrust in our elections. We 
should never forget that this same dis-
trust and disinformation fomented a 
mob of violent insurrectionists who 
stormed into this very building, the 
very heart of our democracy, less than 
6 months ago. 
Now, unfortunately, that cat is out of 
the bag. I don’t see this widespread 
public distrust in our elections going 
away anytime soon as a result, espe-
cially as long as our former President 
continues to add more fuel to the fire 
and particularly when Republicans— 
even Republicans who know that he is 
lying—continue to follow him down 
that rabbit hole. 
In one of New Mexico’s other neigh-
boring States, in Arizona, there is a so- 
called audit of the votes cast in their 
largest county. This bogus audit is 
being conducted by a private company 
paid for by secret pro-Trump funders, 
with no effective oversight. 
When 
you 
outsource 
nonpartisan 
election work to a firm calling them-
selves the Cyber Ninjas, you know 
things are off the rails. All of the dis-
trust in our elections that has been 
ginned up by the former President is 
all the more reason for us to come to-
gether to pass commonsense reforms 
that would restore all Americans’ faith 
in our elections and in our democracy. 
The right of every lawful American 
to vote is just that; it is a right, and no 
one, no one, should be able to take that 
away. The public should have con-
fidence that our leaders are working on 
their behalf, not in fealty to a class of 
dark money billionaires. They deserve 
transparency so that they can see who 
is behind the political ads on their tele-
vision screens and their social media 
feeds. Most importantly, they deserve 
to know that our fundamentally Amer-
ican right to vote is secure, accessible, 
and easy to navigate for every single 
lawful American. 
That is why it is so important for the 
Senate to take up the For the People 
Act this week. This comprehensive leg-
islation addresses all of the critical 
challenges facing our political systems 
and our democratic institutions. The 
For the People Act would restore 
transparency, 
accountability, 
and 
strong ethics rules for our elections. 
It would stop billionaires from being 
able to anonymously pour buckets of 
cash into our elections in an effort to 
buy them. It would put an end to par-
tisan gerrymandering and broken elec-
tion rules that allow Republicans and 
Democrats alike to rig the system for 
themselves and for special interests. 
And it would modernize voting systems 
so that every American, no matter 
their race, their political party, or 
their ZIP Code, can have confidence in 
their ability to exercise their right to 
vote. 
Democrats and Republicans in the 
Senate should come together to pass 
commonsense election security, voter 
protections, and campaign finance re-
forms in the For the People Act. Each 
of these provisions, on their own, have 
won bipartisan support at the State 
and local level. In a previous, less par-
tisan time, these ideas would have 
earned broad bipartisan support here in 
Congress. These are not Democratic or 
Republican 
ideas; 
they 
are 
funda-
mental reforms that we need to pass in 
order to restore the essential American 
idea that each of us has a say in who 
we elect as our leaders. 
The House has already passed the For 
the People Act earlier this year. It is 
now the Senate’s turn to take up this 
critical legislation. Unless we can pass 
the reforms that are in the For the 
People Act, we will keep living under a 
broken status quo where the special in-
terests wield far too much control and 
State lawmakers can continue to un-
dermine 
and 
ignore 
constitutional 
rights. 
It is outrageous that Senate Repub-
licans, as we heard from the minority 
leader, are planning to block legisla-
tion to restore voting rights and bring 
much-needed transparency and ethics 
into our elections. Their refusal to 
even allow debate on the For the Peo-
ple Act should be seen for what it is. It 
is a ringing endorsement of former 
President Trump’s conspiracy theories 
and his attacks on our elections and on 
reality itself. 
Refusing to take up the For the Peo-
ple Act will prop up the campaigns 
that we are seeing in States across the 
country that strip Americans of our 
hard-won right to vote. 
Mr. President, I want to be clear. If 
Senate Republicans are successful later 
today in using the filibuster to block 
the Senate from even debating the For 
the People Act, this cannot be the end 
of the story. We simply cannot give up 
on passing voting rights legislation in 
this Congress, not when our democracy 
is what is on the line. 
We should all remember that the fili-
buster is a rule, a rule that cannot 
even be found in the Constitution, but 
voting, voting is an American right. 
When I think about this, I remember 
my former colleague across the hall 
from me, actually, when I served in the 
House, Representative John Lewis. It 
was one of the most humbling experi-
ences of my life to be able to serve in 
the same Chamber as Congressman 
Lewis. 
John Lewis dedicated his entire life 
to the fight for the right of all Ameri-
cans to cast their ballot safely and 
without fear of discrimination. More 
than 50 years ago, he and so many oth-
ers marched and put their lives on the 
line to call on President Lyndon John-
son and Members of Congress from 
both parties to pass the Voting Rights 
Act. Back then and every time the Vot-
ing Rights Act has been reauthorized 
since, Senators from both parties have 
found a way to protect our democracy 
and preserve the right to vote. 
Right now, America is facing down 
daunting threats to our democratic 
values here at home. For the first time 
since the Civil War, the greatest 
threats to the Republic are from with-
in. History will judge all of us based on 
what we do to defend that fundamental 
right for all—not some but all—of our 
fellow Americans. 
Mr. President, will we meet this mo-
ment? If we fail to rise to the discrimi-
nation baked into these State laws, our 
failure will cast a long shadow. I will 
be proud to cast my vote on the side of 
democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, later 
today, the Senate will vote on S. 2093. 
S. 2093 is the new S. 1. It is the latest 
version of the so-called For the People 
Act, which is a massive, massive Fed-
eral takeover of election law. 
So why are we taking up a massive 
Federal takeover of election law? Well, 
that is a good question. Two years ago, 
Democrats told us that we needed to 
pass this law because our electoral sys-
tem was broken. Well, then came 2020. 
We had a record voter turnout, the 
largest voter turnout since the election 
of 1900, the largest turnout in 120 years 
in American history. And Democrats 
won the White House. 
After that, it got a little awkward to 
complain that our electoral system was 
broken. So Democrats found a new ar-
gument. Now, we have to pass this leg-
islation to stop States from taking 
away 
voting 
rights. 
According 
to 
Democrats, States’ moves to update or 
clarify their election laws in the wake 
of pandemic challenges and vote-count-
ing confusion are really plots to re-
strict voter access. 
Of course, so far, most 2021 State 
election law updates have proved to be 
both standard and mainstream, but 
that hasn’t stopped Democrats who 
have, at times, resorted to outright lies 
in their efforts to persuade Americans

June 22, 2021 
that we are facing a voting rights cri-
sis. 
After all, Democrats need to give 
some reason for why we should allow 
the Federal Government to take over 
our entire electoral system. And Demo-
crats’ real reason—because they think 
S. 1 will give them an advantage in fu-
ture elections—is not really one that 
they can use to sell the bill, although 
Speaker PELOSI did admit on national 
television that she thought S. 1 would 
boost Democrats’ electoral chances. 
The question is where to start when 
it comes to the bill’s content. As I said, 
like the original S. 1, the new S. 1 is an 
unprecedented 
Federal 
takeover 
of 
elections. Historically, running elec-
tions has largely been a matter for 
States, which tailor election laws to 
the particular needs of their cities and 
communities. 
S. 1 would impose one-size-fits-all, 
Federal regulations on elections—in 
many cases, deeply problematic regula-
tions. S. 1 would require States to 
allow 
unlimited 
ballot 
harvesting, 
which is the controversial practice of 
allowing political operatives and oth-
ers to pick up and deliver ballots, with 
all of the possibilities for fraud that 
that creates. 
It would gut State voter ID laws— 
laws which, I would point out, are sup-
ported by a strong majority of the 
American people. A recent poll said 80 
percent of Americans support voter ID 
laws. It would remove legal penalties 
for registering individuals who are here 
illegally—and so much more. 
But the new S. 1, like the old S. 1, 
goes way beyond undermining the secu-
rity of our elections and increasing the 
likelihood of voter fraud. It would im-
plement public funding of political 
campaigns, which would mean that 
government dollars, money that be-
longs to the American taxpayer, would 
go to funding yard signs and attack 
ads. Sitting Senators alone could qual-
ify for more than $1.8 billion in public 
funding. And that doesn’t count their 
challengers. 
Yes, with a record high debt, Demo-
crats apparently think that dropping a 
couple billion dollars here and there on 
attack ads and partisan rallies is a 
good use of taxpayer dollars. 
And from there, believe it or not, the 
ideas only get worse. S. 1 would perma-
nently undermine confidence in our 
electoral system by turning the Fed-
eral Election Commission, the primary 
enforcer of election law in this coun-
try, into a partisan body. That is right. 
The Democrats’ bill would turn the pri-
mary enforcer of election law in this 
country into a partisan body. Now, I 
am interested to hear how this is sup-
posed to enhance voter confidence in 
our electoral system. Every single FEC 
ruling would be suspect. 
And on top of all this, S. 1 makes a 
concerted attack on freedom of speech. 
It would impose onerous requirements 
and restrictions on political speech. It 
would open up private Americans to re-
taliation and intimidation simply for 
making a donation to support a cause 
they believe in. And it would allow the 
IRS to consider organizations’ beliefs 
when deciding whether or not to grant 
them tax-exempt status. 
In fact, the ACLU—the American 
Civil 
Liberties 
Union—actually 
op-
posed the House’s version of S. 1 in the 
last Congress because the bill would 
‘‘unconstitutionally burden speech and 
associational rights.’’ That is right. 
The American Civil Liberties Union op-
posed the legislation because the bill 
would 
‘‘unconstitutionally 
burden 
speech and associational rights.’’ 
As hard as it is to believe when you 
look at the bill’s provisions, S. 1 was 
billed as an election integrity bill. In 
fact, this legislation would undermine 
election integrity, making our elec-
tions less secure and more susceptible 
to fraud. And it would undermine voter 
confidence in our elections. 
The partisan divide in this country 
has reached new heights, and voters on 
both sides have lost confidence in our 
electoral process. Any election legisla-
tion that we take up should be focused 
on building voter confidence in the 
fairness of our electoral system, not 
undermining it. 
Do my Democratic colleagues seri-
ously believe—seriously believe—that 
S. 1 would do anything to increase 
voter confidence in the unbiased char-
acter of our electoral system? Do they 
seriously believe that their bill looks 
like a nonpartisan attempt to protect 
American elections? They can’t pos-
sibly. 
From the newly partisan FEC to an 
IRS empowered to reject tax-exempt 
status for organizations whose beliefs 
it doesn’t like, S. 1 is very clearly a bill 
designed purely and simply to enhance 
political power—the political power, 
Democrats hope, of the Democratic 
Party. It is the very opposite of a non-
partisan reform bill. 
And I have to ask my Democratic 
colleagues, do you really want an elec-
toral system that is perceived as par-
tisan and which half the country 
doesn’t trust? Haven’t we seen the con-
sequences of that? Are you really pre-
pared to sacrifice voter confidence in 
our electoral system just so you can 
win elections? 
Later this afternoon, we will vote on 
S. 1. And I fully expect that this legis-
lation will be blocked, and it should be. 
The Senate’s rules, which require the 
agreement of 60 Senators to move for-
ward to consider legislation, were de-
signed—designed—for times just like 
these, times when a narrow partisan 
majority attempts to shove through 
partisan legislation, times when a par-
tisan majority attacks the freedoms 
that our government exists to protect. 
The Senate was established to act as 
a monitoring body and check attempts 
to ride roughshod over minority rights 
or to curtail our rights and our lib-
erties. And today the Senate will fulfill 
that role and prevent this dangerous, 
partisan takeover of our electoral sys-
tem from moving forward. 
To elaborate on that point for just a 
moment, when I asked the question 
earlier on about why would you bring 
this bill to the floor—it is a good ques-
tion, I think, knowing full well that it 
is going to fail, and should fail later 
today, but why would you bring it to 
the floor? Well, allegedly, the reason to 
bring it to the floor was to provide 
pressures on certain Democratic Mem-
bers that this is the reason that they 
need to vote to do away with the legis-
lative filibuster, which is something 
that has been part of the Senate going 
back to our Founding Fathers. In fact, 
the very reason the Founding Fathers 
created the U.S. Senate was a check 
and balance against majoritarian rule 
and running roughshod over the rights 
of the minority here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. And the legislative filibuster has 
ensured and provided that protection, 
so much so that it was used extensively 
in the last 6 years, when Republicans 
were in control of the Senate, by the 
Democrats to filibuster legislation. In 
fact, 
it 
was 
used 
to 
filibuster 
coronavirus relief bills. It was used to 
filibuster police reform bills. It was 
used over and over to block the former 
President’s nominees. And yet, now, we 
are being told that the Senate needs to 
get rid of the legislative filibuster and 
that all those Democrats, all those on 
the other side of the aisle who used it 
extensively to block Republican legis-
lation over the past 6 years, now be-
lieve that we need to get rid of this leg-
islative filibuster and that this bill is 
example No. 1 for why that is nec-
essary. 
Well, it is really ironic and inter-
esting to hear Members on the other 
side make that argument, given where 
they were a couple of years ago. It was 
just a couple of years ago—maybe 3 
years ago—that 33 Democratic Sen-
ators signed a letter—a letter—to the 
Republican leader at the time, Senator 
MCCONNELL, saying that we need to 
preserve the filibuster, the legislative 
filibuster, in the Senate because it is so 
crucial to the essence of the Senate 
and the protections that it provides for 
the rights of the minority here in the 
U.S. Senate. Thirty-three Democrats, 
many of whom are still serving in this 
body, adopted that position. 
And, in fact, the Democratic whip, 
my counterpart on the Democratic 
side, said, a couple of years ago on a 
morning show: 
I can tell you that would be the end of the 
Senate as it was originally devised and cre-
ated going back to our Founding Fathers. We 
have to acknowledge our respect for the mi-
nority, and that is what the Senate tries to 
do in its composition and in its procedure. 
‘‘I can tell you,’’ he said, the Demo-
cratic whip, the Senator from Illinois, 
‘‘that it would be the end of the Senate 
as it was originally devised and created 
going back to our Founding Fathers.’’ 
In other words, we need to preserve the 
filibuster to preserve our democracy. It 
is essential. That was the view as re-
cently as a couple of years ago. And 
now, now, we have to get rid of the fili-
buster to preserve our democracy 2

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4666 
June 22, 2021 
years later. The filibuster, the legisla-
tive filibuster, which in various forms 
has served our Republic now for over 
two centuries. It has been a part of the 
U.S. Senate checks and balances that 
the Founders envisioned for this coun-
try. 
And yet here we are bringing a bill to 
the floor for no other purpose than to 
have a show vote to try and pressure 
certain 
Democratic 
Senators 
who, 
rightfully, are defending the legislative 
filibuster as an essential element of 
protecting the rights of the minority in 
the Senate, of requiring cooperation 
and collaboration and bringing people 
together on legislation. Solutions in 
the Senate, historically—and I was a 
staffer here back in the 1980s. That is 
how long my tenure, at least as a staff-
er and now subsequently as a Member, 
goes back. But the Senate is a place 
where solutions tend to be found in the 
middle because that is required. It is 
required that there be 60 votes to move 
consequential legislation. And as a re-
sult of that, Members on both sides 
have to come together. If you want to 
pass big things in the Senate, you have 
to figure out a way to get 60 votes. And 
right now that would require—in the 
Senate, if you had every Democrat, 50 
Democrats, you would have to get 10 
Republicans. As was the case when we 
had the majority in the Senate, we had 
to get seven Democrats to do anything. 
And so, in order to even move essential 
legislation like the coronavirus bill, we 
had to reach out to the other side. And 
it forced that compromise, that col-
laboration, that willingness to come 
together and work in a bipartisan way 
on solutions that are durable, that are 
durable for this country. 
It is really interesting in this Wash-
ington Post op-ed by Senator SINEMA, 
where she points out—makes that very 
point that if you can do something at 
51 votes today, and one side blows up 
the rules in the Senate, that when the 
majority changes—and it always does 
in the Senate, and she points out that 
sometimes when you get in the major-
ity, you think you will be there for-
ever. Well, I have been here long 
enough to have been in the majority 
and the minority and in the majority 
and the minority again. It goes back 
and forth. 
So what are you going to do then the 
next time the Senate majority flips 
and all those things that the other side 
thinks are awful, awful ideas that the 
Republicans have, and they would love 
to be able to block them or at least 
force Republicans to come to the table 
and negotiate a solution that would re-
quire some bipartisan participation to 
get to 60 votes—what are you going to 
do then, where we have 51 votes when 
one side gets the majority and 50 votes 
and we go back and forth and we have 
this policy, this kind of policy roller 
coaster that provides no certainty, no 
predictability, and certainly gets away 
from the checks and balances that the 
Founders intended? 
The filibuster—the legislative fili-
buster, the rules of the Senate, the pro-
cedures of the Senate, are designed to 
protect and preserve democracy not to 
undermine it. What undermines it are 
cynical attempts to try and use a piece 
of legislation that the leadership on 
the other side knows is going nowhere 
and bring it to the floor for a show vote 
to put pressure—to put pressure—on 
Senate Democrats, who, as I said, 
rightfully, are defending that very pro-
cedure, which has worked so well to 
their advantage for the past 6 years. 
And now we are told the reason they 
have to change it is because Repub-
licans are being so—we are not cooper-
ating. We are not—you know, we are 
sticks in the mud. We are stopping and 
blocking things. 
We haven’t even been in the minority 
now for 6 months. We spent the last 6 
years in the majority, as the other side 
extensively—and I emphasize ‘‘exten-
sively’’ because any study of the data 
would suggest that—to block Repub-
lican initiatives, to force Republicans 
to come together to find 60 votes. That 
was their position and posture for the 
past 6 years, including 33 Democratic 
Senators who, as recently as 3 years 
ago, sent a letter to the Republican 
leader, saying that we have got to pro-
tect the legislative filibuster—state-
ments like the one made by the Sen-
ator from Illinois that doing away with 
the filibuster would end the Senate as 
it was originally devised and created, 
going back to our Founding Fathers. 
One of the essential elements of this 
Republic constitutionally was the need 
for checks and balances. And the bi-
cameral creation of the Founding Fa-
thers, the House, which is based upon 
the majority, 2-year terms, designed to 
reflect the will of the of people, the 
balance and check that was created 
against that was the U.S. Senate, with 
6-year terms, where you have proce-
dures and rules that make it more dif-
ficult and challenging, that force this 
place to be more deliberative, to be 
more compromising, to consult and 
work together. 
And so what we are doing today, you 
are going to get up, and my colleagues 
on the other side are going to talk 
about how critical it is that we do this 
because all these States are enacting 
these terrible, terrible election re-
forms. And as I said earlier, most of 
which, at least from what I have seen, 
are very mainstream and consistent 
with what the Founders designed in 
our Constitution, and that is for States 
to have principal primacy when it 
comes to controlling and regulating 
elections in this country. But as I said, 
it was argued 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 
in 2019, when this bill was introduced, 
that it needed to be introduced because 
we have got to do something to in-
crease participation in our elections; 
that we really need to encourage peo-
ple to be more active in our elections; 
that we have got to get people to vote, 
which they did, in record numbers—the 
biggest turnout since 1900, biggest 
voter participation in the 2020 election 
literally in 120 years in American his-
tory. 
So now they introduced a bill this 
year, and the stated reason is, we have 
to do this to stop all these States that 
are adopting these legislative solutions 
that are going to make it more dif-
ficult for people to vote. Well, all I can 
say is, the rationale for what we are 
doing today changes depending on the 
year, depending on the election, but 
the goal is the same, and that is to cre-
ate a permanent political advantage 
for one party—that is all this is 
about—and to persuade and pressure 
certain Democratic Senators to do 
away with one of the fundamental ele-
ments of the U.S. Senate in the form of 
a legislative filibuster. 
I hope this vote will make at least 
some Democrats think twice about the 
wisdom of permanently politicizing our 
electoral system and that it will en-
courage them to make sure that any 
future election reform proposals are 
genuinely bipartisan in nature. 
Unfortunately, I think it is more 
likely that Democrats are going to use 
this vote to argue for destroying the 
Senate’s longstanding protections for 
minority rights. But today—today, at 
least, the Senate will fulfill its con-
stitutional mandate and act as a check 
on this attempt to undermine our basic 
freedoms. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I rise 
today at a defining moment in Amer-
ican history and at a time when I sin-
cerely believe that what we do or fail 
to do will have long-lasting and far- 
reaching implications for the health, 
viability, and vitality of the world’s 
greatest democracy. 
We debate many important issues in 
this Chamber, but this issue, the issue 
of voting rights, I argue, is decidedly 
different. 
It 
is 
formative 
and 
foundational. It is the framework in 
which all of our other debates take 
place, for this issue is about the preser-
vation and the protection of the de-
mocracy itself. That is, after all, what 
we claim to be. That is who we are—a 
democracy built on that sacred idea of 
one person, one vote. 
With all the arguments taking place 
in the country right now, with all of 
the audits being ordered, and with all 
of the voting legislation being fever-
ishly passed in States all across our 
country, clearly, ironically, there is 
agreement—albeit for different reasons 
on the right and on the left—that de-
mocracy itself is in danger. Folks on 
the left and folks on the right believe 
that there is something broken and it 
needs to be fixed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4667 
June 22, 2021 
If that is, indeed, the case, what kind 
of Congress would we be in the whole 
history of Congresses if, seeing that 
discussion out there, we refuse to even 
debate the matter in here? Who are we 
and how are we to hide in a moment 
like this? 
So I rise with what I think is a sim-
ple request of my colleagues. Let’s do 
our job. Resist the easy route, the 
temptation to hide behind Senate pro-
cedure, and let’s have a principled con-
versation in front of the American peo-
ple about voting rights. Let’s have that 
conversation right here, right now. 
How could we do otherwise? 
It is said that we are the most impor-
tant deliberative body on the planet. 
Well, colleagues, how derelict in our 
duty would we be if, in this defining 
moment we refuse to even have a de-
bate—a debate—about how best to pre-
serve and protect that which is most 
precious: the democracy itself. 
In my maiden speech this past 
March, I made an urgent call upon this 
body to act to protect the right to 
vote, and I warned then that the cords 
of our democracy were dangerously 
frayed. That was not theoretical stuff 
from me. I hail from Georgia. I argued 
then that our democracy was being 
frayed by unfounded conspiracy theo-
ries that led to an attack on this very 
Chamber and undermined by an on-
slaught of State-level proposals aimed 
at suppressing the vote. 
Since I gave that maiden speech, 
things have only gotten worse. When I 
spoke here in March, 250 voter suppres-
sion proposals had been introduced in 
43 States—250 proposals. Now it is 389 
proposals in 48 States. A violent as-
sault on this Capitol is now metasta-
sizing to voter suppression proposals 
all across the United States of Amer-
ica. Since I spoke here in March, Geor-
gia and 13 other States have enacted 
these voter suppression bills into law— 
14 in total. That is 14 States, and 
counting, 
where 
partisan 
actors, 
power-hungry politicians have acted 
along partisan lines to make it harder, 
not easier, for eligible voters to cast a 
ballot and guarantee that ballot will 
actually count. 
In Georgia, after record voter turn-
out in a historic election, there is now 
a provision in S.B. 202 that allows par-
tisan actors at the State level to take 
over the board—to take it over—to 
take over the process at the local level 
as voters are casting their ballots. 
Imagine that. That same law also al-
lows any citizen to challenge the vot-
ing rights of an unlimited number of 
citizens, making it difficult to see how 
you can certify any election. 
Let’s not kid ourselves. In this 
Chamber, of all places, a few months 
after January 6, this is dangerous stuff. 
That is one reason we need to debate 
the legislation before us. 
I am hoping to include a provision I 
introduced yesterday with some of my 
colleagues that will prevent politicians 
from being able to overrule local elec-
tion officials and therefore subvert the 
voices of the people. This provision will 
also protect local election volunteers 
from harassment and intimidation. 
Right now across the Nation, con-
stitutional rights are being assaulted, 
and I fear that if we don’t act as a body 
in this moment, we will have crossed a 
dangerous Rubicon in our Nation that 
will make it extremely difficult for the 
next generation to secure voting rights 
for every eligible American. 
This is not just another moment in 
another Congress. We should not think 
of this as rote and routine. This is a de-
fining moment that calls upon us to 
speak, to debate, to act. After all, Con-
gress represents the people. It is the 
job of Congress, as prescribed in article 
I, section 4, to ensure that the people 
are not squeezed out and locked out of 
their own democracy. This is not our 
house; this is the house of the people. 
We are stewards of that trust. We have 
to ensure that the voices of the people 
can be heard in their own house, and 
that is why I am urging my colleagues 
to begin debating on the voting rights 
legislation before us. That debate is 
happening right now out there. How 
could it not happen in here? 
I know some of my Republican 
friends are vowing to prevent this de-
bate, to stop it before it begins. And we 
are not talking yet about passing the 
bill. Be very clear. We are just talking 
about talking about it, and they don’t 
even want to do that. Really? 
Surely 
some 
of 
my 
Republican 
friends believe at the very least that in 
this Chamber, we should be able to de-
bate about voting rights. After all, vot-
ing rights are preservative of all other 
rights. And what could be more hypo-
critical and cynical than invoking mi-
nority rights in the Senate as a pretext 
for preventing debate about how to pre-
serve minority rights in the society? 
I stand here as a proud American. I 
believe in democracy with all of my 
heart. I believe that democracy is the 
political enactment of a spiritual idea, 
that we are all children of God, and 
that we have within us a spark of the 
divine and therefore a right to help de-
termine our country’s direction and 
our destiny within it. 
I believe in democracy, government 
of the people, by the people, and for the 
people. I believe that the blind spots in 
our public policy and the wrongs in our 
history are made right through the 
power of democracy, people of diverse 
perspectives helping us to see more 
fully and embrace more completely 
what it means to be a government of 
the people, by the people, for the peo-
ple. It is how Black people finally 
gained their citizenship; women, the 
suffrage; members of the LGBTQ+ com-
munity, their dignity and equality 
under law. 
Diverse perspectives and voices help 
us to see what we would not otherwise 
see, and that is precisely what is being 
imperiled right now by all of these 
voter suppression bills and by some in 
this Chamber to forestall a necessary 
debate about voting rights at this de-
fining moment in our history. 
Mr. President, who are we and how 
are we to hide at a moment like this? 
Why are some people hiding? To what 
end? For what purpose? At whose be-
hest? From whom are they hiding—the 
American people who sent us here in 
the first place? 
I hope we can take a bipartisan vote 
to begin debate on this important piece 
of legislation because that is what de-
mocracy is all about. History is watch-
ing, and the future is waiting to see if 
we are who we say we are—the United 
States Senate, a serious-minded, delib-
erative body, the United States of 
America, a nation built on that simple 
but sublime principle: one person, one 
vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I had 
not planned to speak about the Demo-
cratic power grab known as S. 1 and 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act. I have 
said my piece on this bill before on the 
Senate floor and in many other forums. 
But I have listened to my Democratic 
friends all day long talk about this bill. 
We will later today vote on what is 
known as a motion to proceed to the 
debate on this bill. That motion will 
fail. It won’t come close to passing. 
And our Democratic friends are saying: 
They won’t even debate. They won’t 
even debate election reforms. 
Well, first off, let me say, if you ask 
me what the Republican plan to fed-
eralize our elections is, my answer is, 
we don’t have a plan to federalize our 
elections. We don’t think we should 
federalize our elections. We think the 
States and their counties have done a 
pretty good job, traditionally, of run-
ning our elections. 
I would also remind my Democratic 
friends that what they present as some 
kind of unprecedented affront to hav-
ing a democratic debate in the Senate 
happened 
repeatedly, 
hundreds 
of 
times, in the last administration. 
My Democratic friends simply voted 
not even to have a debate—not even to 
have a debate on, say, a coronavirus re-
lief package last summer, which could 
have gotten aid to families and busi-
nesses when they needed it. When the 
pandemic was still raging, when vac-
cines were still months away, they fili-
bustered even a debate until after the 
election, when we passed, in December, 
almost exactly the same bill that was 
under consideration. 
They blocked even a debate—even a 
debate—on policing reforms last sum-
mer that might have helped provide po-
lice departments across the country 
with additional financial support or 
training resources. 
I could go on and on about the bills 
on which they blocked even a debate, 
like protecting unborn children who 
can survive outside their mother’s 
womb. Yet, today, the Democrats act 
as if it is some terrible affront that we 
are not even going to have a debate on 
a bill that would be one of the biggest 
power grabs by Washington in the his-
tory of our democracy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4668 
June 22, 2021 
Then you have a lot of Democrats 
who are complaining that the civic 
rules and customs—the filibuster has 
to go. They say it is a racist relic of 
the Jim Crow era. 
I will acknowledge that some Demo-
crats over the years used the filibuster 
to block civil rights progress, but I will 
also remind my Democratic colleagues 
that, yes, they used the filibuster hun-
dreds of times in the last administra-
tion. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD this 
letter written on April 7, 2017, persua-
sively authored by SUSAN COLLINS and 
CHRIS COONS and signed by more than 
60 of our fellow Senators urging Sen-
ator MCCONNELL and Senator SCHUMER 
to ‘‘preserve the existing rules, prac-
tices and traditions as they pertain to 
the right of Members to engage in ex-
tended debate on legislation.’’ 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, April 7, 2017. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, 
Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL
AND 
DEMOCRATIC LEADER SCHUMER: We are writ-
ing to urge you to support our efforts to pre-
serve existing rules, practices, and traditions 
as they pertain to the right of Members to 
engage in extended debate on legislation be-
fore the United States Senate. Senators have 
expressed a variety of opinions about the ap-
propriateness of limiting debate when we are 
considering judicial and executive branch 
nominations. Regardless of our past dis-
agreements on that issue, we are united in 
our determination to preserve the ability of 
Members to engage in extended debate when 
bills are on the Senate floor. 
We are mindful of the unique role the Sen-
ate plays in the legislative process, and we 
are steadfastly committed to ensuring that 
this great American institution continues to 
serve as the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. Therefore, we are asking you to join us 
in opposing any effort to curtail the existing 
rights and prerogatives of Senators to en-
gage in full, robust, and extended debate as 
we consider legislation before this body in 
the future. 
Sincerely, 
Susan M. Collins, Orrin Hatch, Claire 
McCaskill, Lisa Murkowski, Christopher A. 
Coons, Joe Manchin, John McCaine, Patrick 
Leahy, Roger F. Wicker, Luther Strange.

Mr. COTTON. They note that these 
rules have changed on our Executive 
Calendar when we consider traditional 
nominees or executive branch nomi-
nees, but they say: 
We are mindful of the unique role the Sen-
ate plays in the legislative process, and we 
are steadfastly committed to ensuring that 
this great [American] institution continues 
to serve as the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. Therefore, we are asking you [Senator 
SCHUMER and Senator MCCONNELL] to join us 
in opposing any effort to curtail the existing 
rights and prerogatives of Senators to en-
gage in full, robust, and extended debate as 
we consider legislation before this body in 
the future. 
Let me remind you, more than 60 
Senators 
signed 
this. 
Twenty-six 
Democrats currently serving in the 
Senate signed it, 27 if you include the 
Vice President. 
Let me just give you a few notables. 
As I said, the Vice President signed it. 
The following chairs of Senate commit-
tees signed this letter 4 short years 
ago: Senators LEAHY, WARNER, CANT-
WELL, CARPER, REED, STABENOW, and 
MENENDEZ. Some other notable Sen-
ators—as I said, it was authored by 
Senator COONS, one of Joe Biden’s clos-
est friends in the U.S. Senate. Senator 
KING, who often finds himself in the 
middle of consequential debates; Sen-
ator HEINRICH, who apparently has 
changed his tune and today is advo-
cating aggressively to eliminate the 
filibuster, just like Senator SCHATZ; 
Senator BOOKER; Senator FEINSTEIN, 
one of the longest serving Democrats 
in the Senate; Senator KAINE, who was 
the Vice Presidential nominee for the 
Democratic Party in 2016; Senator 
TESTER, again, who often finds himself 
in the middle of consequential, bipar-
tisan negotiations. 
Yet, 
somehow, 
something 
has 
changed since 2017. Something has 
changed, and most of these Democratic 
Senators now think that the Senate 
rules must be destroyed so they can 
pass their massive power grab. What 
could it be that has changed? What 
could it be? I don’t know. Maybe— 
maybe it is that Democrats have the 
most slender reed of power with Joe 
Biden in the White House and a 50–50 
Senate and a four-seat majority in the 
House. 
I wish my Democratic colleagues un-
derstood that the shoe can pinch when 
it is on the other foot. 
NOMINATION OF CHRISTOPHER CHARLES 
FONZONE 
Mr. President, Huawei is no ordinary 
phone company; it is the eyes and ears 
of the Chinese Communist Party. Ac-
cording to our Department of Defense, 
Huawei is a ‘‘Communist Chinese mili-
tary company’’ that is controlled by 
the 
People’s 
Liberation 
Army. 
A 
former officer in the PLA founded 
Huawei. 
Huawei is built on stolen technology 
from American companies like Cisco, 
and it is engaged in espionage all 
around the world on behalf of its mas-
ters in Beijing, which raises some im-
portant questions. 
Should American citizens work on 
behalf of a Communist Chinese mili-
tary company? If they do, should they 
then go on to serve in senior positions 
in the U.S. Government, making poli-
cies that will directly affect our safety 
and security? These aren’t academic 
questions. The Senate is now consid-
ering whether to confirm one Chris-
topher Fonzone for a senior legal posi-
tion in the Office of the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence. 
By all accounts, Mr. Fonzone is a ca-
pable lawyer. I don’t question his 
qualifications or his character, but 
there is reason to question his judg-
ment. 
While working as a law partner at 
Sidley Austin, Mr. Fonzone performed 
legal work for Huawei, as well as Chi-
na’s Ministry of Commerce. He per-
formed this work during a critical pe-
riod when our government was actively 
exposing Huawei as a Chinese spy com-
pany and applying sanctions to it. 
He also wasn’t just a longtime lawyer 
in private practice with long-standing 
clients, to include foreign clients; he 
had spent most of his career in govern-
ment, primarily in national security 
roles. I cannot imagine that he was not 
aware of the China threat in general or 
the Huawei threat in particular. After 
all, the House Intelligence Committee 
had produced a landmark report expos-
ing Huawei in 2012, while he served in 
the Obama administration. 
Now, I recognize he didn’t do all that 
much work for Huawei—just a few 
billable hours here and there—but the 
fact remains that he first served 
Huawei, and now he wants to serve in 
the U.S. Government. Nor is he willing 
to foreclose the possibility of working 
for such companies in the future. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Fonzone is far 
from alone in his lapse of judgment. 
There is a rapidly revolving door in 
Washington, DC, that shuttles people 
in and out of government. Unfortu-
nately, some of those people go on to 
work for companies with ties to the 
Chinese Government and its armed 
wing, the People’s Liberation Army, 
after they cycle out of government. 
These individuals are part of what I 
call the new China lobby. They work at 
white-shoe law firms, sprawling multi-
national corporations, and big banks. 
Their pockets are lined with Chinese 
Communist cash, just like Hollywood 
executives and NBA stars and ivory 
tower academics. Some of them get 
very rich by doing Beijing’s bidding, 
and they don’t want the gravy train to 
stop. 
Consider a recent article in the Fi-
nancial Times, which reported that 
some of the richest banks and invest-
ment firms in America had been form-
ing partnerships with Chinese state- 
run banks. Similarly, some of Amer-
ica’s biggest companies, like Nike and 
Coca-Cola, are so addicted to access to 
the Chinese market that they lobbied 
last year against a bill to crack down 
on goods made by slave labor—all be-
cause that bill would make it more dif-
ficult for Coke and Nike to make their

products in China and to keep access to 
the Chinese market. 
At the same time as our country 
wages a cold war against the Chinese 
Communist Party, some of our best 
and brightest are taking their talents— 
King James, LeBron James, who is up 
to his ears in Chinese cash—to work for 
companies that are little more than 
puppets of the Chinese state. 
That is deeply troubling, and it is 
high time the U.S. Senate take a stand 
against the China lobby. That is why I 
will, regrettably, oppose Mr. Fonzone’s 
nomination. Although he is far from 
the worst offender, it is time we start 
drawing a line, and in the future, I will 
therefore carefully scrutinize nominees 
for ties to the regime in Beijing and 
military companies like Huawei. 
If you wish to serve in the U.S. Gov-
ernment in the future, let me be very 
clear: Do not do business with the Chi-
nese Communist Party or its military 
or the companies that support it. Stop 
it today. Don’t take the work. Don’t 
take the meeting. Don’t cash the 
check. 
A man cannot serve two masters. It 
is as true today as it was in the old 
days. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
Mr. 
President from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
Senators 
RUBIO, PETERS, and I be allowed to 
complete our remarks before the sched-
uled rollcall vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
any objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF KIRAN ARJANDAS AHUJA 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I am 
here today to talk about those things 
that unite us as Americans, and I am 
here to talk about those things that di-
vide us. 
For centuries, public service has been 
something 
that 
unites 
Americans, 
drawing us together. Citizens from all 
walks of life serve in our military. 
They serve in Federal and State and 
local governments. They serve in po-
lice units and in fire departments 
across our country. They serve as 
teachers and coaches. And we as a na-
tion are better off for their service and 
for their sacrifice. 
Those who serve our Nation do it not 
because they have to but because they 
want to. They do it because they be-
lieve this Nation is worth serving. 
They do it because they believe this 
Nation is worth defending. They be-
lieve it is worth celebrating. And they 
are right to think all of those things. 
Service to this country is an act of 
selflessness that affirms our Nation is 
a place worth believing in. 
But I am concerned that the present 
administration 
and 
this 
President, 
President Joe Biden, do not share this 
point of view. I am worried that Presi-
dent Biden is nominating for Federal 
office individuals who do not share a 
view of America as a good and decent 
place, who do not believe that the his-
tory of this Nation is worth cele-
brating; nominating, instead, people 
who believe that this is a country 
founded in racism and shot through 
with corruption. 
Many of these nominees are partisans 
of a viewpoint that goes by different 
names but shares several features in 
common—a view that America is a sys-
temically racist place and systemically 
unjust; a view of America as corrupt; a 
view of American society as one that 
needs to be deconstructed, that needs 
to be pulled apart, torn down, and then 
rebuilt in a fundamentally different 
way. 
Now, this broad ideology has become 
known in public as critical race theory 
or sometimes just critical theory. And 
let me tell you, as someone who has 
taught in our Nation’s universities, 
someone who has seen our institutions 
of higher learning up close, I would say 
to those in the media and elsewhere 
who now deny that there is any such 
thing as critical theory, that critical 
theory is, in fact, very real, it is very 
influential, and it appears to have be-
come the animating ideology of this 
administration. That is cause for great 
concern. 
Critical theory is an ideology that 
says the United States is rotten to its 
core. The leaders of this movement 
think our society is defined by White 
supremacy. They think our leaders are 
complicit, at best. 
They think that all Americans are ei-
ther oppressors or oppressed. In our 
world-class military, these critics see a 
vehicle 
for 
discrimination. 
In 
our 
American flag, they see propaganda. In 
our family businesses, they see White 
supremacy. In our police officers, they 
see agents of racial oppression. 
These critics allow no room for 
merit, for experience, or for grace in 
our life together. They pit Whiteness 
and Blackness against each other in a 
manner that reduces every American, 
no matter their character or their 
creed, to their racial identity alone. 
One of these critics, Dr. Ibram Kendi 
wrote this: 
The only remedy to past discrimination is 
present discrimination. The only remedy to 
present discrimination is future discrimina-
tion. 
That is right. That is what he said. 
Think about that for a moment. He is 
saying he is opposed to equality under 
the law. He is opposing our merit-based 
system for Federal employment. Dr. 
Kendi and his followers are in no un-
certain terms advocating for State- 
sanctioned racism in the United States 
of America. 
Now, it is a free country. Dr. Kendi 
and these other authors can write their 
books and debate their views and put 
them out in public. It is absolutely 
their right to do so. They are welcome 
to do so. But what we cannot allow— 
what we must not allow—is our Fed-
eral Government to affirm and sanc-
tion and advocate this critical race 
theory. We cannot allow the United 
States of America, the greatest Nation 
on Earth, to legitimize a new era of ra-
cial engineering. 
In the past few years, critical race 
theory has gained new prominence in 
the giant corporations, in the media, in 
the military, and even in our children’s 
schools. We are seeing this across the 
country. We have seen too many of our 
children exposed to a curriculum like 
the 1619 Project and its derivatives 
that encourage division rather than 
unity, that rewrites our history in the 
service of an ideological agenda rather 
than in the service of truth. 
Young children set off to school with 
eyes full of hope and hearts, full of 
pride in our country, only to be taught 
that White privilege defines the Na-
tion, that subjects like mathematics 
are inherently racist, that the Chris-
tian faith is oppressive. They are 
taught that the nuclear family perpet-
uates racism. 
Now, imagine for a moment if you 
were taught the same. Imagine if you 
were taught that your dreams were un-
just or unfair, that your family were 
oppressors, that you were at fault for 
the problems of our society today. 
These are just children. We should be 
nurturing their dreams. We should be 
nurturing their hopes. We should be 
giving them a great hope for the fu-
ture, for the future of this great Nation 
known as the United States of Amer-
ica, a hope for the future of the great-
est Nation in the history of the world, 
rather than teaching them to mistrust 
their classmates and to distrust their 
own history. 
It doesn’t end there. Last year, we 
discovered that Federal agencies and 
other organizations funded by tax-
payers were holding workplace training 
sessions where Federal employees were 
told that ‘‘virtually all White people 
contribute 
to 
racism’’—that 
is 
a 
quote—or where civil servants were re-
quired to say that they ‘‘benefit from 
racism.’’ 
Now, President Trump put an end to 
this divisive curriculum, and he was 
right to do so. Workplace diversity 
training should focus on bringing peo-
ple together, not on driving them 
apart. But under this new administra-
tion, I fear that critical theory is mak-
ing a comeback. 
In March, President Biden rescinded 
the former President’s ban on this divi-
sive curriculum, and now, he has nomi-
nated Kiran Ahuja to be Director of the 
Office of Personnel Management. That 
is a key position that runs human re-
sources for the entire Federal Govern-
ment and millions of its employees. 
Ms. Ahuja’s nomination is before the 
Senate today. I am concerned that Ms. 
Ahuja is a disciple of radical theorists. 
She 
has 
frequently 
promoted 
Dr. 
Kendi. She called him a ‘‘thought lead-
er’’ at her confirmation hearing back 
in April. Just last year, Ms. Ahuja 
wrote that we must free the Nation 
from the ‘‘daily trials of White suprem-
acy.’’ Those are her words. 
She appeared to endorse Dr. Kendi’s 
claim that the election of President

Trump in 2016 was an example of ‘‘rac-
ist progress’’ in this country, and she 
declared that we must do everything in 
our collective power to realize Dr. 
Kendi’s vision for America. 
I am concerned that, as the Federal 
Government’s HR director, Ms. Ahuja 
could use her platform to promote rad-
ical ideologies that seek to divide rath-
er than unite people. She could bring 
critical race theory back into Federal 
Government training and to every level 
of Federal personnel, stronger than 
ever. And I am not alone in this con-
cern. All of my Republican colleagues 
on the Homeland Security Committee 
opposed Ms. Ahuja in a vote back in 
April. 
Two weeks ago, the Federal Law En-
forcement Officers Association—they 
represent 100,000 Federal police officers 
that protect and defend our Nation 
every day—they announced that they 
were also concerned about Ms. Ahuja’s 
nomination because of her advocacy of 
critical theory. 
I have to say, I agree with Federal 
law enforcement. I agree with what 
they said in their letter. We should 
nominate candidates for public office 
that are committed to ideological neu-
trality, to fairness, and to impartiality 
under the law. I want to be clear, I do 
not for a moment question Ms. Ahuja’s 
sincerity or integrity. In fact, I thank 
her for her willingness to serve the Na-
tion; but I cannot agree with what ap-
pears to be her fundamental ideology. 
At the end of the day, this is not about 
politics or personalities; this is about 
ensuring that the Federal Government 
stands for unity, not division, har-
mony, not hate. 
As the Reverend Dr. King famously 
said, and he was right, we should judge 
our fellow citizens by the content of 
their character, not by the color of 
their skin. We need a strong nation 
with strong citizens who see each other 
as Americans, not as oppressors or op-
pressed. 
Now, I have heard a lot of criticism 
about my position here today. I have 
heard the corporate media and those on 
the left say that I misunderstand crit-
ical theory or that it is not real or that 
it is not a real problem. I have heard 
many say the United States is indeed 
built on oppression and remains a sys-
temically racist place. 
All I can say is that is not the Amer-
ica I see, that is not the America I 
know. The working people of this coun-
try who have rallied to this Nation’s 
flag in every hour of danger, who are 
the first to help a neighbor in need, 
who coach our Little Leagues and vol-
unteer at our churches, who go to work 
day in and day out to provide for their 
families and protect the place they call 
home, these are not oppressors; these 
are liberators. These are not oppres-
sors; these are great people. They live 
with a spirit of liberty that has made 
this country the greatest country in 
the history of the world, and they want 
to see that liberty extended to every 
member of the American family. That 
is who the American people are. That 
is what makes them great. That is 
what they believe—because they are a 
great people. Our future is a cause for 
hope and not despair. 
The advocates of critical theory tell 
us we have to dismantle our culture, 
our history, our families, our Jewish 
and Christian heritage and beliefs be-
cause they are all oppressive. They say 
the future of this Nation will be de-
fined by racial division and racial 
strife. I reject that prophecy of our fu-
ture, and I take my stand on the good-
ness of the American people and the 
God who guides us. I take my stand on 
hope. 
It is not oppression that defines the 
American story. It is hope. From the 
minutemen at Lexington and Concord, 
to the pioneers who found a new life in 
the West, to the heroes of the Under-
ground Railroad, to the Union soldiers 
at Little Round Top, to the workers 
who fought the old monopolies for fair 
pay, to the women who fought for suf-
frage, to the young men who twice lib-
erated Europe, to the civil rights dem-
onstrators likes of Bull Connor, to the 
firemen and police officers who rebuilt 
New York and gave this country con-
fidence again in the years after 9/11, it 
is love for one another and love for our 
country that we call home that has de-
fined our story and given us hope; and 
that love and that hope will define our 
future once again. I am confident of it. 
In this Nation, we are not united by 
ethnic creed or race or religion—and 
proudly so. We are united by our 
shared history. We are united by what 
we love together. We are united by the 
radical belief that those who liberate 
others, those who practice grace and 
mercy, those who call forth the best in 
those around them, they are the ones 
who changed the world; and that prin-
ciple, that truth, that hope, is what 
drives our history. And we are not done 
building that history yet. The greatest 
Nation in the history of the world is 
not done yet. 
Critical theory in all of its guises dis-
torts our history, it destroys our com-
mon love, and it would leave us hope-
lessly divided, at enmity with one an-
other and alone. To this dark vision, 
we must say no. To radical hope, we 
must say yes. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to vote no on Ms. Ahuja’s nom-
ination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise to 
support Kiran Ahuja’s nomination to 
be Director of the Office of Personnel 
Management, or OPM. Ms. Ahuja is a 
proven leader who has the experience 
and commitment needed to restore 
confidence in OPM and provide a vision 
for the future of the Federal workforce. 
OPM is an independent agency that 
supports more than 2 million Federal 
employees who serve all across the gov-
ernment. Both OPM and the Federal 
workforce have faced unprecedented 
challenges in recent years, from at-
tempts to dismantle the agency, to a 
record-setting government shutdown, 
to the coronavirus pandemic. And un-
fortunately, 
these 
challenges 
were 
made worse due to the lack of con-
sistent and committed leadership at 
OPM. Our dedicated public servants are 
on the frontline every day, responding 
to the ongoing pandemic, protecting 
our national security, and delivering 
vital services to the American people 
each and every day. The dedicated men 
and women who serve at OPM and 
throughout the civil service deserve a 
qualified, experienced leader who is 
committed to supporting the people 
who make government work. 
Ms. Ahuja’s career includes over two 
decades of management experience, in-
cluding running nonprofit organiza-
tions, leading the White House initia-
tive on Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers during the Obama administra-
tion, and serving as Chief of Staff at 
OPM. 
Throughout this confirmation proc-
ess, Ms. Ahuja has demonstrated that 
she understands the mission of OPM 
and the experience of safeguarding the 
nonpartisan civil service. She has com-
mitted to working closely and trans-
parently with Congress to strengthen 
and to modernize the Federal work-
force. 
I am confident that Ms. Ahuja is the 
right person to lead OPM at this piv-
otal time. She will provide the stra-
tegic vision and the management need-
ed to reinvigorate the Federal work-
force. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the confirmation of Kiran 
Ahuja for Director of OPM.

NOMINATION OF KIRAN ARJANDAS AHUJA 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise in support of Kiran Ahuja and her 
nomination to be the Director of the 
Office of Personnel Management, or 
the OPM. OPM needs an experienced, 
qualified leader who is committed to 
the Federal workforce and is invested 
in their future. 
Ms. Ahuja is that leader. She under-
stands the unique challenges facing 
OPM, and she has the management ex-
perience and vision needed to restore 
and strengthen the workforce. I am 
confident that Ms. Ahuja is the right 
person to lead OPM at this pivotal 
time. I urge my colleagues to join me

of 
Kiran Ahuja for Director of OPM.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4672 
June 22, 2021 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. I rise today to en-
courage all of my colleagues to support 
the motion to proceed that is in front 
of us. 
We might disagree about the under-
lying bill. In fact, we do disagree. Re-
publicans 
and 
Democrats 
disagree 
about the underlying bill, but that fact 
shouldn’t prevent us from even having 
a discussion about the bill and about 
the issue. It is what we were sent here 
to do, to talk about the important 
issues that face the American people. 
I can’t think of anything more im-
portant, anything more fundamental to 
our democracy than the freedom to 
vote. That is what we are talking 
about, the freedom to vote. We are sent 
here to make our best arguments, to 
try to persuade Members who don’t see 
the issue in the same way that we do, 
and in the end, to vote on important 
legislation like the bill that is in front 
of us to protect our freedom to vote as 
Americans. 
I want to thank Senator MANCHIN for 
being willing to engage in this process 
in good faith and for his hard work on 
the issue. I have to wonder why my Re-
publican colleagues won’t do the same. 
What are they so afraid of? It is hard to 
believe that they are afraid of even 
having the debate—even having the de-
bate. Are they afraid that if the Amer-
ican people hear both sides, the Amer-
ican people will figure out what they 
are trying to do? After all, the aim of 
the For the People Act is simply to 
protect Americans’ freedom to vote 
and ensure their voices are heard. 
Sadly, these rights are under attack 
all across the country, including Michi-
gan. State lawmakers have introduced 
at least 389 bills to make it harder to 
vote in 48 States. In 2021, at least 14 
States have enacted 22 new laws to 
take away people’s freedom to vote. It 
is clear this is part of a coordinated, 
nationwide assault on a fundamental 
right that my friend, the late Congress-
man John Lewis, called ‘‘precious, al-
most sacred.’’ 
Right now in Michigan, Republicans 
in the legislature are trying to push 
through a package of bills that will 
make it much harder for people to 
vote. 
Some analysts have even described 
the bills as being worse than the ones 
in Georgia, except we aren’t watching 
them try to criminalize water. 
Why are they doing this in Michigan? 
Well, let me go back again. Michigan is 
traditionally a tickets-winning State, 
what you would call a purple State. In 
2010, Michigan elected a Republican 
Governor. Two years later, Michigan 
helped give President Barack Obama a 
second term. Two years later, we re-
elected the Republican Governor, and 2 
years later, Michigan supported Donald 
Trump by the narrowest margin of any 
State, just over 10,000 votes. 
After that election, Democrats did 
not start a massive effort to take away 
people’s freedom to vote. We got to 
work. We organized. We listened to 
people about their concerns, and we 
worked hard to gain people’s support 
for the next election. That is what you 
usually do, rather than trying to stop 
people from voting. 
We did that hard work in Michigan, 
and you know what, we won the next 
election. In 2020, in the middle of a pan-
demic, more people in Michigan voted 
than ever before, 5.5 million of us. And 
Michigan voters clearly and resound-
ingly chose Joe Biden to be our next 
President and KAMALA HARRIS to be 
our next Vice President of the United 
States and the President of the Senate. 
They won by more than 150,000 votes. 
That is 14 times Donald Trump’s mar-
gin in 2016. 
But what did the Trump campaign 
do? Well, their campaign—his allies 
filed eight lawsuits in our State, lost 
every one. And in the only case that 
was appealed to the Michigan Supreme 
Court, the court declined to hear the 
case, despite having a majority of Re-
publican justices. Republicans know 
that Michigan’s election was fair, the 
results were accurate, and Joe Biden 
and KAMALA HARRIS won our State. 
The people of Michigan voted. Michi-
gan counties verified it. Our State cer-
tified it. There was no evidence of 
fraud that would begin to suggest that 
we need legislation like what Michigan 
Republicans are pushing. The Repub-
licans 
just 
didn’t 
like 
who 
Michiganders voted for. That is the 
same thing that is happening here. Re-
publican colleagues don’t like being in 
the minority. They don’t like who peo-
ple voted for. Well, you have a choice. 
You could work hard, try to gain peo-
ple’s trust, try to do things for people, 
win the next election, or you can try to 
take away their freedom to vote. 
I mean, think about it. Think about 
the fact, in Michigan, Republicans 
didn’t like who we voted for, so they 
are coming after the voters. They are 
coming after the voters. We know this 
is happening all across the country. It 
is wrong. It is un-American, frankly. 
And that is why we need this legisla-
tion, to protect our freedom to vote 
and to stop billionaires from buying 
elections. 
We are committed to making sure 
people have their freedoms protected, 
and we are committed to making sure 
that billionaires are not buying our 
elections as well. We want to end the 
partisan gerrymandering that makes 
people’s votes count—some count more 
than others—or rig the system. And we 
are committed to making sure that the 
wealthiest people in the country are 
not buying elections. 
Why is this important? We have seen 
how so-called dark money groups that 
don’t have to report anything, funded 
by a handful of billionaire donors, pour 
unlimited amounts of money into our 
elections in an attempt to influence 
the outcome. It is easy to understand 
why the average voter might feel their 
voice isn’t being heard. 
The For the People Act takes the 
crucial steps to give voters their voices 
back. It includes disclosure require-
ments so that citizens have a right to 
know who is giving them money, who 
is behind those dark money donations. 
It reforms the Federal Election Com-
mission so they can better enforce the 
election laws already on the books, and 
it takes steps to protect our elections 
from foreign influence. 
I, for one, think these are essential 
to our democracy. I know my Senate 
Democratic colleagues feel the same. 
However, Senate Republican colleagues 
disagree. 
So let’s pass this motion to proceed 
so we can talk about it, so we can have 
a debate about it. Michigan voters 
made their voices heard. The American 
people made their voices heard in the 
election. We need to be debating this 
issue and making sure that our voices 
are being heard across the country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk 
will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Without ob-
jection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
this afternoon, we will have before us, 
as Members of the Senate, legislation 
that is entitled the For the People Act. 
Before I speak to the For the People 
Act, S. 1, I want to make clear to col-
leagues that I have been keenly fo-
cused, interested in ensuring that when 
we have elections in this country, that 
they are free, they are fair and they 
are accessible to all, that barriers to 
voting should be placed on the side-
lines. 
For the past three sessions of Con-
gress now, I have been the only Repub-
lican cosponsor of the Voting Rights 
Advancement Act. This was a measure 
that in prior Congresses was led by 
Senator LEAHY, and I was pleased to be 
able to join him as a cosponsor. That 
measure has now been introduced on 
the House side as the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Act, a measure to basically 
reestablish the preclearance system, 
which was in place until 2013, and then 
it was pretty much upended with the 
Supreme Court ruling in Shelby. 
I certainly and absolutely intend to 
cosponsor that measure again under its 
new name, the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Act. I will work with Senator 
LEAHY, I will work with Senator 
MANCHIN—I will work with anybody on 
this initiative to help update this for-
mula to ensure that we do have just ex-
actly that, access to voting that is 
equal, that is fair, that is free from dis-
crimination. 
I note at the outset of my comments 
this morning the support for that legis-
lation so that, again, folks understand 
that I fully understand that access to 
the ballot in this country is not perfect 
and, again, that I have stood behind 
legislation to ensure that our elections

are fair. We have come a long way. We 
have come a long way, but I think we 
all recognize that there is a long path 
ahead of us. 
So let me turn to S. 1, the For the 
People Act. My fear is that this meas-
ure does not move us further down the 
path. If you look at the bill, it is whol-
ly partisan. Unlike the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Act, which is very nar-
rowly focused on voting rights, S. 1 has 
been described as sprawling. It has 
been described as ambitious, which is 
fair. Ambitious is not a bad thing, but 
it is clearly, clearly very broad, and it 
certainly contains some noteworthy 
goals, but I fear that there are provi-
sions contained within S. 1 that take it 
too far or that I think are bad policy or 
that I simply think are beyond the 
power of Congress to regulate. 
My concern, and I shared this with 
many, is that the bill that we have in 
front of us is not so much about voting 
rights as it is a Federal takeover of the 
election system—and a partisan Fed-
eral takeover of the election system. 
The way the bill is being advertised— 
that somehow or another, we can’t 
count on States to do elections right or 
fairly—is a premise that I have a prob-
lem with. I come from a State where 
we were under preclearance for a long 
period of time. We recognize that. We 
had a history that was not one that I 
think we were proud of in terms of en-
suring that there was fair and open, 
equal access to all. But what we have 
seen in the State and how we have 
worked through that process that was 
in place some years back is that we 
have come to this place where we can— 
we have demonstrated that we can run 
a proper and an honest election. We 
have proven this time and again. 
Much of my concern about what we 
have in front of us is that when you na-
tionalize something, when you have 
kind of a Federal overall oversight, it 
ends up being a one-size-fits-all man-
date coming out of Washington, DC, 
and in many cases doesn’t work in a 
place like Alaska. 
There are certain aspects of S. 1 that 
I absolutely do support. Early voting. 
We shouldn’t be limited to just the day 
of the election. I think we recognize 
that. What we can do to ensure that 
early voting is there I think is impor-
tant to us. 
I come from a State where, if you 
want to vote absentee, there is no ex-
cuse required. You can just vote absen-
tee because it is more convenient to 
you. I will tell you, I was really sur-
prised to find out how many States do 
not allow for that. I think that is 
something we need to address. I am in 
support of that. 
I think we need to be doing more 
when it comes to ease of voter registra-
tion. Again, in the State of Alaska, we 
have put in place ways to make it easi-
er for folks to register. But, again, I 
am looking at what we have done in 
Alaska, proud of some of the measures 
we have put in place, but I recognize 
that 
we 
did 
this 
without 
DC 
prescriptives 
or 
mandates 
of 
uni-
formity. 
So in walking through some of the 
concerns that I have—I mentioned 
making voter registration easier. Well, 
the For the People Act mandates auto-
matic voter registration. OK. Maybe a 
good idea. In Alaska, what we have put 
in place is that Alaskans are automati-
cally registered—unless they specifi-
cally opt out, they are automatically 
registered to vote when they sign up 
for their Permanent Fund dividend. 
This is obviously very exclusive and 
unique to one State and one State 
alone. But under this measure that we 
have in front of us, it would require 
State election officials to automati-
cally register any eligible unregistered 
citizens. 
So I am looking at that and I am say-
ing: All right, well, if we allow for 
automatic registration on the PFD— 
there are a lot of Alaskans, believe it 
or not, who do not sign up for the PFD 
or are not eligible for the PFD. So is 
the State going to have to have two 
different systems here in terms of how 
we meet this mandate? 
I am looking at it and saying: Well, 
that is a fair amount of Federal micro-
management here. If the State wants 
to implement an automatic system, it 
should do so, as Alaska did, but with-
out the threat of the Federal Govern-
ment looming behind them, making 
sure the i’s are dotted and the t’s are 
crossed in precisely the way the Elec-
tion Assistance Commission thinks 
they should be. I don’t think we want 
to make the administration of elec-
tions involve even more burdensome ef-
forts or more cost. It is something that 
you look at and say: Let’s make sure 
we can allow for easier registration, 
but let’s not impose burdensome man-
dates. 
Early voting requirements is another 
issue. The bill requires at least 15 days 
of early voting. This is something, 
again, in Alaska that we already do. It 
works great, but it also requires that 
each polling place must be open for at 
least 10 hours a day. So we are basi-
cally back here in Washington, DC, 
telling us in Alaska that you have to 
have your polling place open for 10 
hours a day. 
Think about this in the context of a 
small community. I will take a super 
small 
community, 
Arctic 
Village. 
About 150 people total live there in the 
village—not 150 voters but 150 people 
total. It wouldn’t make sense. It 
wouldn’t make sense for the State to 
maintain poll workers for at least 10 
hours per day, for at least 15 days, in a 
community like Arctic Village. The 
whole town can practically vote in an 
hour. But that is not the point here. 
The point is, you are imposing a Fed-
eral mandate in a one-size-fits-all ap-
proach that just might not fit well 
there. 
One provision in the bill that I have 
some significant concerns about is re-
quiring same-day voter registration 
across the country. Again, in Alaska, 
we think we have been doing a pretty 
fair job as to how we run our elections. 
I think it is reasonable that we be al-
lowed to establish voter registration 
deadlines that work for the administra-
tors in their respective States. 
I know some people are surprised, but 
the fact is, we don’t know everything 
best back here in terms of how to im-
plement or how States should be imple-
menting. States should have the lati-
tude to implement a registration sys-
tem that works with the State’s geog-
raphy, with their IT infrastructure, 
and with their election funding and 
other limitations they may have. 
Forcing States to allow ballot har-
vesting—this is another area I have a 
problem with. This practice involves 
paid campaign operatives going out, 
collecting ballots, and returning them 
to be counted. I don’t know. I look at 
this one and see so many ways in which 
this can be abused and exploited. 
If a State wants to permit this prac-
tice with certain parameters that the 
State thinks would prevent abuses, 
that is fine, but not all States should 
be forced to do so by the Federal Gov-
ernment and be made subject to DC’s 
idea of what actually works here. 
Maintaining voter rolls. I think we 
all want to make sure that voting rolls 
are current or accurate, but the provi-
sions in S. 1 really go very far. The bill 
would require States to secure ‘‘objec-
tive and reliable evidence.’’ This is a 
term that is not actually defined in the 
bill, and they have to be able to estab-
lish that before removing a voter. What 
is not considered objective and reliable 
is a failure to vote or the failure of a 
voter to respond to a notice sent by the 
State informing the voter that they 
have been removed. So you are going to 
have a situation here where this unde-
fined term will result in people who 
have long since left the jurisdiction ac-
tually remaining on the voter rolls. 
Then there is the issue of restruc-
turing the Federal Election Commis-
sion. From its very inception, this was 
designed to be—this was meant to be a 
body that was bipartisan to specifically 
ensure that no political party would 
grant its candidates an unfair advan-
tage in elections. So you have got a re-
structuring that is proposed here that I 
think presents a flaw. It would reduce 
the number of seats on the FEC from 
six to five, two members each from the 
two major political parties and one os-
tensibly Independent. So what this 
could mean is that a President could 
simply find someone who would vote in 
his or her favor each time but who 
never registered as a member of a par-
ticular political party. 
This newly partisan FEC would also 
be given the responsibility of handing 
out loads of cash from the public cof-
fers. I take issue with this, and I think 
that you have a fair amount of folks in 
my State and across the country who 
do take issue with that as well in 
terms of public funding. 
S. 1 creates a new structure of public 
financing of campaigns that matches

small dollar donations on a 6-to-1 basis. 
So I look at that, and, again, I have 
concerns about why anyone thinks it is 
a good idea to have even more money 
in politics. But it is easy to me to see 
how this could be exploited by a par-
tisan board holding the purse strings 
here. So, again, I look at that as a par-
ticular example of, what are we doing 
with this in this voting rights bill? 
I mentioned in my introduction here 
that I feel that you have many provi-
sions in this measure that are likely 
unconstitutional. To start, while Con-
gress has broad authority to regulate 
the times, places, and manner of con-
gressional elections, our powers are 
much more limited in how a State 
chooses to appoint electors to the elec-
toral college. There, we may only de-
termine the time of choosing electors 
and the day on which they should give 
their vote. So every provision that pur-
portedly changes State laws regarding 
how a State chooses its electors could 
face significant and I think justified 
challenges in court. 
There are numerous provisions that 
try to criminalize speech that is al-
most certainly protected. Even the 
ACLU opposed several parts of this bill 
on the grounds that it would unconsti-
tutionally limit the speech of citizens 
as well as compel speech, neither of 
which is acceptable. Just 2 years ago, 
the Fourth Circuit invalidated a law 
that was nearly identical to a provision 
that is contained in this bill. 
Another issue is the issue of tax re-
turns and whether or not Congress can 
mandate candidates for President to 
release their tax returns. I think it is 
only reasonable that they should do so, 
but the concern that I have is, the Con-
stitution is really pretty clear in out-
lining the requirements to be Presi-
dent, and releasing tax documents is 
not one of those. So it just kind of pre-
sents a challenge there. Can we direct 
that? There is an issue. 
Requiring States to create redis-
tricting commissions may also be un-
constitutional since Congress cannot 
coerce or commandeer the mechanisms 
of State government. Congress also 
likely doesn’t have the authority to re-
quire States to permit convicted felons 
to vote or the ability to impose an eth-
ics code on the Justices of the Supreme 
Court. 
So while these may be good ideas, is 
the constitutional authority there? I 
think there is a real question to that. 
So my concern—and I am coming to 
the end of my comments here—my con-
cern about this measure is that while 
the title is strong, ‘‘For the People,’’ I 
am not certain that this measure will 
do what those who have hoped that it 
would do will do—it will make admin-
istering elections more difficult, more 
expensive, 
and 
subject 
to 
Federal 
micromanagement. 
Again, I mentioned the issue of ques-
tions of constitutionality and whether 
aspects of it will be thrown out. Pass-
ing this into law could result in messy 
litigation that leaves the state of elec-
tion law uncertain for years to come. 
I mentioned my concern about one- 
size-fits-all. That is challenging. We 
are a pretty amazing 50 States, but we 
are all a little bit unique. But how 
States have leeway or latitude in de-
termining what works I think is impor-
tant. 
So I recognize that we are at a place 
and a time when credibility and faith 
in our institutions are at a really weak 
moment, a very weak moment, and so 
when we think about the things that 
are core to our institutions, one of 
those fundamentals is the fairness of 
our elections and also ensuring that we 
are taking an approach in this Nation 
where all people feel that the election 
process is for them as equal and fair as 
it is for their neighbor down the street 
or their fellow American all the way 
across the country. How we are able to 
deliver on this promise is something 
that we need to continue to strive to-
ward. 
So I am going to continue to work on 
voting rights reform. I am going to be 
doing that through the template of the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Ameri-
cans need to have faith in our institu-
tions. They need to know that our elec-
tions are fair; that they are easy and 
accessible for all; and we can’t instill 
that trust with a wholly partisan ef-
fort. We have got some work to do. We 
have got a lot of work to do, and it is 
important work. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Colorado. 
Mr. 
BENNET. 
Madam 
President, 
when I got up this morning, the fur-
thest thing from my mind was that I 
was going to have a chance to see you 
today. And since I am seeing you 
today, I want to say thank you. I want 
to say thank you for your role in this 
administration and in leading the 
Biden administration to make a pro-
posal that was passed in the American 
recovery plan that is going to cut 
childhood poverty in this country al-
most in half this year. 
And what people should know is not 
only that the President—the President 
sitting here—led that effort at the 
White House, but she led it from the 
very beginning. She was one of the 
original sponsors of that legislation. 
And even though the President’s budg-
et has said we ought to make it—ex-
tend it to 2025, I just want to let you 
know that we are still fighting here to 
make it permanent, and I think we 
should make it permanent. 
We have already had—this is why I 
am here today. But we have already 
had Columbia University tell us that 
there is going to be an eight times an-
nual return on the investment that we 
make as part of the recovery because 
instead of mitigating for the problem 
of kids in poverty, we will actually be 
eliminating poverty for almost half the 
kids in this country—for millions of 
American children. And not only that, 
over 90 percent of American kids are 
going to benefit from this Biden-Harris 
tax cut that is in this package. 
So I just want to say thank you for 
that. And we have got to keep working 
on it, and I agree that it ought to be 
extended for years and years and years. 
For me, that means permanent. We are 
going to keep trying to do that, so 
thank you. 
And thank you for leading on the 
issues that we are here to talk about 
today because this is the moment that 
we are challenged in ways that we have 
never been challenged before. 
Five months ago—a violent mob 
stormed this floor 5 months ago trying 
to stop the peaceful transfer of power 
from one administration to the next. 
And they took us out of this room, and 
they took us to one of the Senate office 
buildings. And I was watching the tele-
vision as I was there, and all I could 
think about was what is the rest of the 
world thinking about when our Capitol 
is being stormed by a violent mob of 
our own citizens—by a violent mob of 
our own citizens—and not just what 
our adversaries are thinking, not what 
is Russia thinking, what is China using 
with this footage, what are the Ira-
nians going to do with this footage, but 
what are people like my mom and her 
parents who were Polish Jews who sur-
vived the Holocaust and, after making 
it through one of the worst moments in 
human history, were able to rebuild 
their shattered lives in this country, in 
the United States of America? 
And to think about similarly situ-
ated people all over the planet for 
whom this is the greatest hope still for 
freedom and for liberty, for democracy 
itself—that is what is at stake, as least 
as far as I am concerned in this debate. 
And I know the President under-
stands this well, and I hope others un-
derstand this well; that even before 
January 6, our democracy was under 
attack. It was under attack as a result 
of gerrymandering. It was under attack 
because of the way special interests 
controlled the agenda on this floor and 
down the hall. It was under attack be-
cause of voter suppression that nobody 
in the 21st century imagined we would 
ever see in our country again, not to 
mention the fact of Citizens United, 
which 
unleashed 
the 
floodgate 
of 
money, of billionaires, to control our 
political system. 
This is an effort to separate the 
American people from their exercise in 
self-government. It is an effort to de-
stroy the American people’s confidence 
in their exercise in self-government. 
And making it harder for people to 
vote is a huge piece of this puzzle. 
Now, this isn’t the first time in our 
history that we have been confronted 
by this kind of stuff. I have said before, 
and it is absolutely true, that you go 
back to the founding of this country. It 
is a story of, on the one hand, the high-
est ideals that have ever been written 
down by human beings and the worst 
instincts that have ever been conjured 
by human beings. In our case, that was 
enslaving other human beings. 
And our history is a story of that 
battle between those highest ideals and

those worst instincts. And every single 
time Americans have stepped up and 
they found a way to make our country 
more democratic, more fair, and more 
free—small ‘‘d’’, democratic—and that 
is what we have to do again. That is 
our job now because, today, in ways 
that were unimaginable to me when I 
was in college, except when I read it in 
the 
history 
books, 
anti-democratic 
forces are stronger than anytime since 
Jim Crow. And it is true. That is a fact. 
What I was reading back in the 1980s 
about laws that had been fought 
against in the 1960s, they are back in 
2020. If you think I am exaggerating, 
here are some examples. In Georgia, 
there are bills to undermine non-
partisan election officials so that poli-
ticians can overturn outcomes they 
don’t like; in Arizona, the same kind of 
thing, a partisan election audit; in 
Florida, a bill to restrict vote by mail; 
State legislators attempting to give 
themselves the power to toss out an 
election, as I said, that they don’t like. 
These are laws all across the country. 
There are 250 or so of these laws that 
are being passed. 
And, by the way, not a single one of 
those is being passed with a Demo-
cratic vote—a vote from a Democrat— 
in 250 legislatures. And you know what 
else doesn’t exist in any one of those 
legislatures? The filibuster does not 
exist in any one of those legislatures. 
We need to stand up for our democracy, 
and that is why we need to pass the For 
the People Act. 
The bill includes commonsense re-
forms that are broadly supported by 
the American people. I know—we know 
these reforms work because they have 
worked in Colorado, where we banned 
gerrymandering. We have automatic 
voter registration. We have early vot-
ing. We have vote-by-mail. We have in-
creased election security. This is all 
nonpartisan. This is all common sense. 
This was done by—this wasn’t done 
by Democrats. It was done by Repub-
licans and Democrats working to-
gether. What is the result? We have the 
second highest voter turnout rate in 
the country—72 percent. I am so sick 
and tired of saying that. I want us to 
be No. 1 so that I don’t have to hear 
from Senator KLOBUCHAR
how Min-
nesota is No. 1. I come here, and I have 
to say we are No. 2. That is not good 
enough. We need to be No. 1. 
But if we had this across the country, 
the agenda in Washington would look 
more like what the American people 
actually sent us here to do. So this 
isn’t just about voting rights, although 
that is very, very important. It is not 
just about elections. That is very im-
portant. But we could finally, prob-
ably, create universal healthcare in 
this country, improve our schools, 
make sure that we had an economy 
that when it grew, it grew for every-
body, not just the top 10 percent. We 
would probably stop spending our time 
cutting taxes for the wealthiest Ameri-
cans when our income inequality has 
never been higher. Although, now that 
I mention that, I realize, because of the 
President’s leadership and President 
Biden’s leadership, we have actually al-
ready started to do that because we cut 
taxes now for the vast majority of 
Americans because of the work that 
they have led. 
We can change the destiny of Amer-
ica. That is what we can do. And that 
is what this exercise in self-govern-
ment is about. We can show that we 
can compete with the Communist Gov-
ernment in China and send a signal to 
people like my grandparents all across 
the world that American democracy is 
stronger than ever and that they 
should trust it; they can count on it 
and maybe get a piece of it for them-
selves; that we remain a beacon of free-
dom and self-government and that we 
remain committed not to our worst in-
stincts but to our highest ideals. 
I would encourage my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
legislation. And with that, I thank my 
colleague from North Carolina for his 
indulgence. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, wel-
come back, and thank you for giving 
me an opportunity to talk about the 
bill that we will have before us in 
about an hour and a half. 
I have to stand here and rise in oppo-
sition to the For the People Act. I 
think you could appropriately title it 
the ‘‘Fool the People Act.’’ We are 
going to be voting on it later today, 
but it would dramatically alter elec-
tion laws across our country. 
I have been in the Senate for 61⁄2 
years, and this ranks up there as one of 
the worst bills that I have seen come 
before this body. I know my friends on 
the other side of aisle like to talk 
about it as being essential for pro-
tecting democracy, but in the face of 
text that could be patently unconstitu-
tional and taking away the rights of 
States to administer their elections, I 
find it hard to believe that it is any-
thing but a motivated attempt to fed-
eralize the Nation’s election system. 
The 
For 
the 
People 
Act 
would 
achieve it through a number of, I 
think, overreaches. I am only going to 
talk about a few. 
For one, voter ID. The For the People 
Act would essentially render null voter 
ID laws across this country. Instead of 
an ID, which most of us have, and vir-
tually, I think, every citizen should 
have, you would simply just sign an af-
fidavit to say you are who you say you 
are. I heard the Georgia law, for exam-
ple, brought up as providing egregious 
limits or obstacles to proving who you 
say you are. 
In a hearing a month or so ago, we 
had an official from Georgia in a Judi-
ciary Committee, and I said: Could you 
explain to me what the challenge is? So 
if somebody gets an absentee ballot 
like you do in North Carolina—we have 
no-excuse absentee balloting. We have 
had it for years. I supported it. I voted 
that way several times. We had people 
say that it was just an egregious impo-
sition to note a 10 or 12 character driv-
er’s license or government ID number 
on the affidavit. That is all it is. You 
don’t have to send a copy of it. You 
just simply have to write a number 
down. 
So if you have an ink pen—I guess 
you could argue if you don’t have a 
writing instrument, then maybe that is 
an overreach or an imposition on a 
voter. I don’t think it is. And even in 
the Georgia law that has been casti-
gated by some of my friends on the 
other side of aisle, they even provide 
for people who want to vote, who may 
not have a government-issued ID, other 
documents that can be used in their 
place. 
We talked about hundreds of bills 
that have been filed by Republican leg-
islators without a single Democratic 
vote that are like the Georgia bill that 
I just described, which I think is argu-
ably a fair bill. But most of these bills 
are things that Democrats and Repub-
licans should be able to agree on. You 
should cleanse your voter rolls. You 
should make sure that people who have 
died and people who could be registered 
in one or more States are cleared from 
the voter rolls just to prevent fraud 
and abuse, not necessarily perpetrated 
by any one party but just because the 
data could be out of date. 
And, you know, back on voter ID, I 
find it remarkable that we have a 
measure before us that we are going to 
be voting on today, a simple ID re-
quirement that 80 percent of Ameri-
cans just this week in a poll said they 
think is reasonable. Now, you have to 
also understand that we make accom-
modations. If you don’t have an ID in 
North Carolina, we moved heaven and 
Earth to make sure—you need a gov-
ernment-issued ID, I believe, to be able 
to move through society, to get a hotel 
room, and to get on an airplane. I had 
to provide—I had surgery a couple of 
months ago. I had to present an ID to 
get admitted into the hospital. I think 
we are disenfranchising people from 
the rest of society by not at least mak-
ing sure that they can identify who 
they are. There is no argument. You 
can’t get on a plane without an ID. You 
can’t travel internationally without an 
ID. You can’t get healthcare without 
an ID. But for some reason, to do some-
thing, to exercise our right and our 
privilege to vote, we think that we 
don’t need an ID. 
I also worry about a provision in this 
bill that would allow nationwide ballot 
harvesting. There are only a couple of 
States that allow ballot harvesting. 
What does that mean? You have a 
worker coming up, going door to door, 
and encouraging somebody to vote. It 
may be somebody who doesn’t want to 
vote. But now, you are up there to cap-
ture their ballots and bring bunches of 
ballots to the polls. 
Ballot harvesting is legal in some 
States—I know California. It is not 
legal in our State. In fact, there was a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4676 
June 22, 2021 
Republican candidate who ultimately 
withdrew himself after winning a race 
after there were a couple hundreds bal-
lots that were supposedly harvested. I 
don’t think he knew about it, but there 
was a campaign operative that did it, 
and it cost him an election. 
I will tell you one thing that I really 
do believe, that if the Founding Fa-
thers were here in this Chamber today, 
they would really be scratching their 
heads, and it is the idea of taxpayer- 
funded elections. Make no mistake 
about it, Federal, State, and local dol-
lars are used to make sure that we 
have election machines, that we have 
poll workers, that we have access. We 
can always improve access to the polls, 
but in this bill, they are saying, and 
people in North Carolina—if you were 
paying attention last year, my race 
was, all in with me and my opponent, 
$296 million. There were a lot of ads on 
TV. 
I had my friends call me up, scream-
ing at the TV when they were mean to 
me. And I am sure I had my opponent, 
who is a friend of mine, say the same 
thing. But now, what we are going to 
do, if we were to pass this bill, is say: 
Tom Tillis supporters are going to have 
to have money spent and directed to 
his opponent to try and beat him, and 
vice versa—millions and millions of 
dollars. 
And in States like North Carolina— 
not only North Carolina taxpayers but 
taxpayers from across this country— 
will see their taxpayer dollars come to 
North Carolina to influence an out-
come in a campaign that could be a 
thousand miles away. That is, I think— 
taking 
taxpayer 
dollars 
and 
then 
spending them on something that they 
are personally opposed to or offended 
by is something that I don’t think the 
Founding Fathers would have ever en-
visioned as being appropriate for this 
great Nation. 
So, ladies and gentlemen, today at 
about 5:30—I think a little after—the 
For the People—or as I said, the ‘‘Fool 
the People’’—Act is going to be before 
us, and it is going to fail. We know it. 
Senator SCHUMER knows it. 
So why are we doing it? Are we doing 
it for messaging points? Or are there 
some far-left liberals that just want 
the vote on the floor, knowing full well 
it is not going to pass? Have we actu-
ally tried to do any work to figure out 
what role the Federal Government 
should play in actually improving elec-
tion outcomes that ultimately need to 
be administered by the State? No, that 
hasn’t happened. 
So today, we are going to come on 
the floor. This measure is not going to 
move forward. And somebody may be 
fooling—I don’t know—far-left groups 
just to say we tried. But they didn’t 
try because if they tried, they would 
have reached across the other aisle and 
tried to figure out something that 
made sense that could pass with 60 
votes. 
The For the People Act is far afield 
from what our Founding Fathers envi-
sioned. Can we improve our election 
processes across this country? Yes, but 
I would prefer to have the 50 labora-
tories of democracy figure out how to 
improve it and have other States im-
plement it, perhaps even other States 
in the northeast that have far fewer 
voting days than we do in North Caro-
lina. They could learn from that. 
Maybe we should create standards 
and incentives for that sort of stuff, 
but not a Federal takeover of the state 
of the elections in this country. And 
for that reason, I will be opposing the 
For the People Act. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from North Caro-
lina for his thoughts. 
We are on the cusp of a vote here on 
legislation that would dramatically 
change the way we conduct our elec-
tions in this country. As my colleague 
said, are all elections perfect? No. But 
I have to tell you, I am really proud of 
what we do in Ohio. We make it easy to 
vote; we also make it hard to cheat, 
and that is the right balance. 
This bill, S. 1, is called the For the 
People Act, but what it actually does is 
it strips away control from people in 
Ohio and elsewhere to build the right 
election laws in our own States and 
centralizes that control here in Wash-
ington, DC. That is not consistent with 
the Constitution or the Federalist Pa-
pers. In addition, some of those pro-
posed changes attempt to undermine 
the First Amendment rights that we 
hold so dear as Americans. 
I am proud of the way we conduct our 
elections in Ohio, in part because we 
have high turnout. In fact, we had 
record turnout last year, and that is 
great. And I don’t want to leave it up 
to Federal employees here in Wash-
ington, DC, to determine how our sys-
tem should work in Ohio, which is 
what this legislation would do. 
I mentioned the Constitution earlier. 
It gives the primary power over elec-
tion administration to the States. It is 
very clear about that. It also says in 
Federalist 59, which is Alexander Ham-
ilton, who was the guy most interested 
in these Federalist issues—he said it is 
clear that the Federal Government 
should only get involved in very ex-
traordinary situations. 
Last fall, 5.97 million Ohioans cast a 
vote—that is a record, as I said—and it 
represented 74 percent of eligible vot-
ers in Ohio. Despite that and despite 
the challenges of running the largest 
election in our State’s history during 
an unprecedented pandemic, we ran 
what was wildly reported on the right, 
on the left, by the media as a secure 
and successful election—in fact, I think 
the most successful election we have 
ever had. Our State-run, bipartisan 
county boards of election, with two 
Democrats and two Republicans in 
each county, were able to do that be-
cause they know what is best for Ohio 
and they are held accountable. 
But this partisan bill claims Wash-
ington, DC, somehow knows better. S. 1 
strips the power from accountable, 
democratically 
elected 
State 
rep-
resentatives in my State and around 
the country to determine congressional 
districts and hands that over to a Fed-
eral panel, again, staffed by unelected, 
unaccountable third parties and a com-
puter program. Again, I think it should 
be something that is part of what elec-
tion representatives are held to ac-
count for, is how we draw our congres-
sional districts. 
It mandates the controversial prac-
tice of ballot harvesting. I don’t like 
ballot harvesting. I think it makes it 
easier for partisan operatives on both 
the right and the left to conduct out-
right voter fraud. 
It would force taxpayers to fund the 
political campaigns of candidates they 
don’t support. It turns the Federal 
Election Commission into a tool of 
whichever party controls the White 
House. So instead of being even, it 
would actually be lopsided and be par-
tisan. 
It seemingly contradicts the 26th 
Amendment by forcing States to let in-
dividuals register to vote as early as 16 
years old, and then it could allow those 
16- or 17-year-olds to vote by banning 
State voter ID laws. The vast majority 
of Americans support voter ID laws. It 
is a fact. Republicans, Democrats, and 
Independents think you ought to have 
some sort of ID when you come vote, 
but this bill bans that safeguard. 
I could list other serious flaws with 
the proposal, but the bottom line is 
that this legislation has been presented 
as a safeguard for democracy when it 
actually contains some radically un-
democratic provisions. 
I am in favor of State-level, common-
sense efforts to increase voter con-
fidence in our elections. We absolutely 
should do that. We need to protect de-
mocracy by ensuring, again, that peo-
ple know it is easy to vote. It is acces-
sible. That is good. We should all want 
that. But we should also make it hard 
to cheat and be sure we have security 
in our elections so people know they 
have trust in the system, that their 
vote is going to count, as it should. 
Again, that is what we do in Ohio. 
I don’t think this legislation furthers 
those objectives. Instead, I think it 
would amount to a Federal takeover of 
our election system, which has always 
been in the domain of the States. 
Our government is built on a care-
fully constructed framework of checks 
and balances, including between the 
branches of government. I cannot sup-
port legislation that would run so 
counter to what the Framers of the 
Constitution intended and the election 
system that works well in my home 
State of Ohio. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I, too, 
rise in opposition to S. 1 and urge a no 
vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4677 
June 22, 2021 
The bill that the Senate will be asked 
to consider today is a truly radical 
piece of legislation. It turns out, be-
cause of that, it is an unpopular piece 
of legislation, the kind of bill the Sen-
ate was created to help stop from be-
coming law. S. 1 seeks to transform the 
way we do elections in this country 
and to do so on a narrow, partisan 
basis. 
Here is what Americans need to un-
derstand about this legislation. 
First, it would strip away the power 
of the States to run elections and hand 
it to the Federal Government, showing 
a complete lack of trust in local and 
State leadership. 
It would also spend millions of tax-
payer dollars to help politicians run 
ads for their campaigns. Taxpayers 
would suddenly have to finance par-
tisan messages they may strongly dis-
agree 
with, 
raising 
serious 
First 
Amendment questions. 
S. 1 would nullify sensible voter ID 
laws across the country, including 
voter identification laws in predomi-
nantly Democrat States, like Con-
necticut and Delaware. 
And the legislation would also give 
the Federal Government the right to 
draw congressional district lines, even 
though States have done this since the 
beginning of our republic. 
At its root, this bill is based on a 
myth. And I consider my words here. It 
is based on a lie, and that lie is that 
voting rights are somehow under at-
tack in States like Georgia and Texas. 
This is utterly absurd, and I think the 
voters in those States understand that. 
The election reforms recently passed in 
Georgia, for example, have actually ex-
panded access to the ballot box, mak-
ing it easier to vote, but also making it 
harder to cheat. 
The new Georgia law does this, 
among other things. It expands the 
window for early voting. The new Geor-
gia law allows no-excuse mail-in voting 
to continue. It adds 100 new ballot 
dropboxes. It allows voters to get a 
government-issued ID for free, and it 
increases transparency in elections, for 
example, making sure the ballot count-
ing does not stop in the middle of the 
night, as we have seen in past elec-
tions. 
These reforms are entirely reason-
able and widely popular across Ameri-
cans and were based on broad input 
from the local stakeholders. 
My colleagues who are pushing S. 1 
say they are trying to save democracy, 
but, in fact, the bill would actually 
harm democracy. S. 1 would undermine 
the security of the ballot box, causing 
more and more Americans to question 
the outcome of our elections. We 
should be working to strengthen trust 
in democracy, not weaken it. 
The only thing bipartisan about this 
bill is the opposition to it. In my home 
State of Mississippi, every Member of 
the House of Representatives—Demo-
crat and Republican—voted against 
this legislation, including Democrat 
Representative BENNIE
THOMPSON, a 
chairman of a committee in the House 
of Representatives, the chairman of the 
Democratic National Convention of 
2020, who said he voted against it be-
cause it was opposed by his constitu-
ents. 
The ACLU has come out against S. 1, 
saying that some provisions ‘‘unconsti-
tutionally impinge on the free speech 
rights of American citizens and public 
interest 
organizations’’—hardly 
a 
rightwing conspiracy group, the ACLU. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
along with 300 other organizations, 
have said this legislation is ‘‘fun-
damentally 
incompatible 
with 
the 
American tradition and the principles 
enshrined in our Constitution.’’ 
And when you ask the public about 
the specific proposals in this bill, many 
Americans—conservative and liberal, 
Democrat, 
Republican, 
and 
Inde-
pendent—are outright opposed. 
According to a recent poll, 81 percent 
of people say they are concerned with 
allowing voters to vote without any 
form of photo ID. Eighty-three percent 
say they are concerned with ballot har-
vesting practices, this practice of hav-
ing party operatives go door to door 
and pick up large numbers of ballots to 
turn them in. Sixty-eight percent of 
Democrats are opposed to so-called bal-
lot harvesting. And 50 percent of people 
say they oppose taxpayer dollars being 
used to pay for political campaigns. 
This, again, cuts across party lines. 
So it is clear that S. 1 is not popular. 
It is squarely at odds with the views of 
the majority of the American people. 
Every Senator who votes yes will 
need to prepare to explain to voters 
why they wanted to overturn State 
voter ID protections, allow ballot har-
vesting, force taxpayers to pay for po-
litical campaigns, and enact a partisan 
Federal Election Commission. That is 
why S. 1 should be rejected this after-
noon, and that is why it will be re-
jected. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this 
afternoon, I want to discuss my grave 
concerns with S. 1. 
Many have said that this political 
power grab is a solution in search of a 
problem. I agree with that. This bill 
contains, I believe, a number of alarm-
ing provisions that would have a dev-
astating impact on our Nation’s elec-
toral process. It would make our elec-
tions more chaotic and less secure. 
This legislation contains more than 
800 pages of bad policies that I believe 
America does not need and does not 
want. I believe that the strength of our 
election system is in its diversity, al-
lowing each State to determine what is 
best for them. S. 1 would force a single, 
partisan view of elections on more than 
10,000 jurisdictions across the country. 
For example, State and local election 
administrators would be forced to 
change, one, how they register voters 
and which voting systems they use; 
how they handle early voting and ab-
sentee ballots; and how they maintain 
voter lists. 
It makes election fraud easier to 
commit and harder to detect by allow-
ing unlimited ballot harvesting, under-
mining voter ID laws, and making it 
more difficult to maintain accurate 
voting lists. A recent university poll 
found that 80 percent of Americans 
support requiring a form of identifica-
tion before a person can vote. Think 
about it—80 percent. 
Remember, now, presently, Ameri-
cans are required to present a photo ID 
to do a number of things. We all do it 
every day: at the airport to board a 
commercial flight; in a hospital for any 
outpatient or inpatient procedure; at 
the pharmacy to purchase over-the- 
counter sinus medication and certain 
prescriptions; at the bank to open a 
bank account; to apply for a mortgage; 
to drive, buy, or rent a car; to get mar-
ried; to purchase a gun; to rent a hotel 
room; to donate blood; to obtain a 
passport; to pick up packages at the 
U.S. Post Office. We all do this every 
day. 
This legislation would permanently 
tip the scales in favor of the Democrats 
by politicizing the Federal Election 
Commission, pouring Federal tax dol-
lars into campaigns and chilling free 
speech. Do Americans really want their 
taxes going toward a Federal campaign 
fund that would finance the expenses of 
all candidates running for Congress? 
S. 1 would reverse years of improve-
ments that have been made in many 
States, improvements that protect the 
security, integrity, and the credibility 
of our elections. Each State, I believe, 
should be left with the freedom and 
flexibility to administer its own re-
spective 
elections, 
without 
inter-
ference from the Federal Government. 
S. 1 mandates ballot drop boxes, 
which increase the risk of fraud by al-
lowing people other than the voter to 
drop off marked ballots outside of the 
view of election officials. 
As I mentioned before, this bill pro-
vides government funding for cam-
paigns: $6 of Federal funding for every 
$1 from small donors. My gosh, it 
would be a windfall for a lot of incum-
bents. This essentially forces Ameri-
cans to fund candidates they don’t 
agree with and support attack ads 
against those they do agree with. 
It federalizes redistricting, putting in 
place one set of Federal rules for re-
drawing congressional districts—some-
thing that has traditionally been a role 
for each State. 
Lastly, Mr. President, S. 1 requires 
States to give felons the right to vote 
once they are out of prison. 
While this is a bad bill all around, I 
believe these are some of the top worst 
provisions and the provisions that 
American people oppose the most: One, 
gutting State voter ID laws, again; 
two, spending taxpayer dollars on po-
litical campaigns; three, allowing un-
limited ballot harvesting; and four, 
turning the Federal Election Commis-
sion into a partisan operation. So just

to name those, among others, are rea-
sons to vote against this bill. 
I think the American people do not 
want this, and they do not deserve to 
be the recipients of such harmful pol-
icy. I do not support this bill, and I 
trust that a majority of the Senate will 
not vote accordingly. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the 
right to vote is the hallmark of a de-
mocracy. It is what distinguishes us 
from authoritarian regimes where elec-
tions are tainted, if they are held at 
all, where the free and fair elections 
that define America do not exist. 
President Abraham Lincoln once said 
elections belong to the people. Voting 
is an action we choose to take to exer-
cise a fundamental freedom our Con-
stitution grants to the people. So when 
we hear of a bill entitled ‘‘For the Peo-
ple,’’ we naturally would assume at 
first that it must be enhancing our de-
mocracy, but a closer examination sug-
gests otherwise. In fact, S. 1 would 
take away the rights of people in each 
of the 50 States to determine which 
election rules work best for their citi-
zens. 
Let’s start with some indisputable 
facts. This legislation was first intro-
duced in 2019, prior to last year’s Presi-
dential election. It was not considered 
in the Senate. It did not become law. 
Nevertheless, according to the Census 
Bureau, the 2020 election saw the high-
est voter turnout in the 21st century. 
Equally significant, Asian Americans 
and 
Hispanic 
Americans 
voted 
in 
record-high percentages, and there was 
higher turnout across all racial groups, 
including Black Americans, than in 
2016. 
The Census Bureau also asked eligi-
ble, nonvoting Americans why they 
didn’t vote in 2020. The majority of re-
spondents said that they were not in-
terested, didn’t like any of the can-
didates, were too busy, or simply for-
got. 
The point is, with the record-high 
turnout in 2020, it is very difficult to 
make the case that this bill is nec-
essary, as some have said, to save our 
democracy. 
This is a bill that was introduced to 
enhance partisan messaging, not to en-
hance participation in our elections, as 
the over-the-top rhetoric about this 
bill highlights. Consider, for example, 
the debate over Georgia’s new election 
law. In many ways, Georgia’s election 
law actually makes it easier for citi-
zens to vote than in other States that 
have not been subject to the same 
backlash. 
Georgia allows no-excuse absentee 
ballots. Delaware, New York, Massa-
chusetts, 
and 
Connecticut do not. 
Georgia’s new law provides a minimum 
of 17 in-person early voting days. Dela-
ware, New Jersey, and Connecticut had 
no in-person early voting days at all in 
2020. Although New Jersey enacted a 
new law to allow early voting earlier 
this year, to great fanfare, it actually 
has 8 fewer early voting days than 
Georgia. Despite having these and 
many other different election rules, 
Delaware, Connecticut, and Georgia 
had very similar levels of Black voter 
turnout in the 2020 election. Massachu-
setts, by contrast, had just more than 
half the Black voter turnout of Geor-
gia. 
This information contradicts the un-
derlying premise in S. 1 that we must 
overturn the laws of every State in our 
Nation in order to preserve the right to 
vote. 
This legislation would force numer-
ous changes to laws in States that have 
been successfully conducting elections 
for a very long time. Let me use the 
State of Maine as an example—a State 
that consistently ranks at or near the 
top of the Nation in voter participa-
tion, I am pleased to report. Maine 
does not have early voting. Maine does 
not allow ballot harvesting. Maine does 
not count absentee ballots that arrive 
after the polls close on election night. 
Maine does not allow voters to receive 
absentee ballots automatically without 
requesting them. Yet, in 2020, 71 per-
cent of Mainers cast a ballot. That is 
41⁄2
percentage points above the na-
tional average. 
These results further demonstrate 
that, absent a compelling need, the 
Federal Government should not be pre-
empting the election laws of all 50 
States. 
Now, let’s examine the burdensome 
list of Federal mandates that advo-
cates of this bill would impose on each 
and every State. Allow me to highlight 
just a few of the significant flaws. 
The bill would require States to 
allow ballot harvesting, where third 
parties, usually political operatives, 
collect ballots from voters. This raises 
obvious and significant concerns about 
voter intimidation, coercion, and bal-
lot security. 
The bill would prohibit voter ID, 
overturning existing law in 35 States. 
It would require that absentee ballots 
be accepted up to 7 days after the elec-
tion, which could lead to chaos and dis-
trust, particularly in close races. 
The bill would transform the Federal 
Election Commission into a partisan 
entity, which would jettison the re-
quirement for bipartisan agreement on 
significant issues and lead to partisan 
enforcement. 
Another problem with this bill is 
that it would allocate billions of Fed-
eral dollars to congressional cam-
paigns, forcing Americans to subsidize 
the 
campaigns 
of 
politicians 
with 
whom they vigorously disagree or sim-
ply dislike. Even very wealthy office-
holders would be eligible for public fi-
nancing. Do we really need more 
money in political campaigns when 
Federal funds could be used to combat 
the opioid epidemic or to reduce hun-
ger among children or to spur eco-
nomic development and the creation of 
more jobs? 
Now, Mr. President, there are, of 
course, times when it is compelling and 
appropriate for Congress to intervene. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is an ex-
cellent example. 
It was passed at a time when many 
Americans, particularly Black Ameri-
cans, faced overwhelming barriers de-
signed to prevent them from voting. 
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is 
still in effect today. It prohibits voting 
practices and procedures that are dis-
criminatory. It also allows the Depart-
ment of Justice to sue any State or 
local government to enforce this provi-
sion. 
Certainly, there are improvements 
that can be made in our election laws. 
For example, I support efforts to dis-
close dark money in campaigns. I sup-
port mandatory reporting to the FBI if 
a foreign government contacts a polit-
ical campaign with an offer of assist-
ance. And I have worked with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
provide generous grants to States so 
that they could better secure their vot-
ing 
infrastructure 
against 
cyber 
threats and foreign intrusions. 
Unfortunately, S. 1 is not legislation 
that could ever form the basis of a rea-
sonable, bipartisan elections reform 
bill. And it is far more likely to sow 
more distrust in our elections than to 
ease the partisan divisions in our coun-
try. For the reasons that I have dis-
cussed, I shall cast my vote against 
this flawed bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor this afternoon to 
urge my colleagues to support this im-
portant legislation. And I listened to 
my colleague from Maine on her re-
marks and I take her at her word. If 
there would be any chance to work on 
these election issues in the future, I 
guarantee we are all ears. 
I say that because I come from the 
State of Washington, and we have a 
very high election turnout. We have a 
very high election turnout rate because 
we have a vote-by-mail system that 
has been developed over a long period 
of time. My colleague knew my prede-
cessor, Slade Gorton, who was a three- 
term Senator. In the 2000 election, I 
won by 2,229 votes, and I am forever 
grateful to Senator Gorton for having 
faith in that election. That election 
that included provisional ballots and 
signatures and all sorts of things that 
people really understood. I think that 
is the principle here. Our election in 
the State of Washington is based on 
your signature. 
That is the way it is now when you 
vote in person, and it is the way it is 
when you vote by mail. So our system 
has a lot of security in it, and this leg-
islation that is before us today is to 
make sure that these rights—these 
civil rights and constitutional rights of 
individuals—are upheld throughout the 
United States of America. 
Now, I understand some of my col-
leagues may not like the ethics reform 
or campaign finance reform in the un-
derlying bill. I support those provi-
sions. But at the heart of this debate is

whether we are going to fight to make 
sure that the Federal Government does 
its job on constitutional rights. I feel 
like there is a little bit of hiding going 
on in this discussion about whether we 
have a role, that this is somehow left 
up to the States. It reminds me of 
when Rosa Parks was sitting on a bus. 
We didn’t say it is just up to those in-
dividual States. Or when people were 
denied equal accommodations at ho-
tels, we didn’t say it was just up to 
those States. And we certainly didn’t 
say, when people used police dogs try-
ing to intimidate women to vote in the 
1960’s, that it was just up to those 
States. 
No, no, no. We did something about 
it. We passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act 
and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. We did 
that because intimidation was hap-
pening, and we needed to correct for it. 
So I hope that our colleagues will 
think about this issue because to me, it 
is the same debate we are having on 
criminal justice reform. So many peo-
ple on the other side of the aisle said: 
You know what, this is up to local po-
lice departments, and it is just up to 
the local governments, and that is all 
there is to it. 
No, that is not all there is to this. 
This is about whether we do our job in 
upholding these constitutional rights 
when certain States don’t do that. 
And so these American voting rights 
are guaranteed by our Constitution. 
The 15th Amendment provides that 
voting rights cannot be abridged on the 
account of race, color, or previous con-
dition of servitude. The 19th Amend-
ment, which turned a hundred years 
old last year, provides that voting 
rights cannot be denied on account of 
sex. The 26th Amendment provides that 
Americans 18 years of age or older can-
not be denied the right to vote on ac-
count of age. 
Generations of Americans fought for 
these rights over many decades, and 
they didn’t come easy to us as a Na-
tion. Nor should we overlook, now, 
these issues as we think that these 
rights, these constitutional obligations 
that we should be fighting for and 
should uphold, are facing challenges at 
the local level. 
I know that my colleagues say that 
these are State rights to hold these 
elections. Article I, section 4 of the 
Constitution empowers Congress to 
make or alter rules for Federal elec-
tions. The U.S. Supreme Court has re-
peatedly upheld this authority as broad 
and comprehensive. The U.S. Supreme 
Court has held that the election clause 
gives Congress the authority to ‘‘over-
ride state laws to regulate federal elec-
tions.’’ 
Now, this was in a pretty famous case 
in 2015. In the majority opinion in the 
Arizona State Legislature v. the Ari-
zona Independent Redistricting Com-
mission, Justice Ginsburg wrote, ‘‘The 
dominant purpose of the elections 
clause, the historical record bears out, 
was to empower Congress to override 
state election rules. The clause was 
also intended to act as a safeguard 
against manipulation of electoral rules 
by politicians and factions in the 
States to entrench themselves or place 
their interests over those of the elec-
torate.’’ 
So these issues are very clear. It is 
calling on us to make sure that we up-
hold those constitutional rights. But 
according to the Brennan Center for 
Justice at New York University School 
of Law, at least 14 States, from Geor-
gia, Florida, Oklahoma, and many oth-
ers, have enacted voting rights since 
the 2020 election to restrict individuals. 
My colleagues have been out here talk-
ing about some of those restrictions, 
and I think those that place undue bur-
dens on individuals are something that 
we should be addressing. Yes, States 
have been at a different pace in allow-
ing vote-by-mail, but we should be em-
powering people. We should say that we 
want to empower more people to vote 
under a system that is fair and gives 
them those opportunities to do so. 
So there are at least 64 bills restrict-
ing voting rights moving through 18 
State legislatures, and I think that we 
should be making sure here that we 
have clarity on what will help us con-
tinue to empower the public to cast 
their vote. 
The For the People Act, S. 2093, is a 
comprehensive bill that makes voting 
easier. It also authorizes $1.7 billion in 
new federal grants to help secure the 
security of our voting system. Again, I 
like our vote-by-mail system in Wash-
ington State. It is based on my signa-
ture to the ballot that is checked at 
the ballot. I can tell you in the last 
election because of the ruses and var-
ious things that went on, 13 different 
people said that they voted on my be-
half. But they didn’t. And our election 
system caught that. They knew that it 
wasn’t me, and they checked the signa-
ture on the ballot, and they knew that 
it was me. So even though the system 
has had people who are trying to cause 
distrust and discord about whether we 
have the right system, it is working. 
And the more we empower people, the 
better our democracy. 
This legislation requires the Director 
of National Intelligence to report on 
threats to election infrastructure, in-
cluding cyber threats, and requires the 
President to develop and implement a 
national strategy for protecting U.S. 
democratic institutions. I know that 
these are things that we should be up-
dating. Throughout our history, fol-
lowing the civil war and reconstruc-
tion, there were localities that used 
discriminatory tactics like poll taxes 
and literacy tests to keep African 
Americans from voting. The Black 
community endured both of this kind 
of intimidation. 
And in the years that followed, 
Americans have protested and marched 
for these voting rights. And out of this 
struggle, Congress passed, and Presi-
dent Johnson, signed the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act 
to make sure that we kept these prom-
ises of our constitution. So the Federal 
Government has had to intervene and 
we have done so I am glad that we did. 
So I hope that we will continue to 
say that these provisions that are so 
important to guaranteeing the right to 
franchise for Americans, are there, and 
that they are continuing to be modern-
ized. I hope that what we will do today 
is the start of an effort to focus on this. 
I take my colleague at her word. I am 
sure she is sincere about wanting to 
vote to help do something on election 
and our democracy. We need to start 
that process today. We need to move 
forward, we need to address these 
issues. We can’t live in a world where 
we are not allowed to move forward on 
a very close election in Washington 
State. That wasn’t the only one we 
had. We had another one, I think, was 
decided by probably, you know, a few 
hundred votes. And were there issues? 
Yes. And guess what. The system re-
solved it. The system found any mis-
takes. 
I keep mentioning, you know, a gen-
tleman who basically when it got down 
to that somebody thought this was a 
Governor’s race that was going to get 
down to 10 or 15 votes, basically de-
cided to say that he had voted for his 
wife who had passed away, and admit-
ted it because he knew in the end that 
they were going to find out. And he 
thought it was better to come forward 
and say I made a mistake. She had al-
ready passed. I sent in her ballot. It 
wasn’t something I should have done, 
and we have a system that can work 
based on our signatures. It can and 
does today. When you go in to vote in 
person, you sign your name, and that is 
the signature, and that is the security 
of the system. And it has allowed us to 
trace and find and now expand to vote- 
by-mail. And it is time for us to say: 
Let’s not make voting harder in the 
United States of America through a 
system that basically disenfranchises 
people, but make a system in the 
United States of America that is about 
giving people these opportunities so 
that people can feel this enthusiasm 
that we see when we successfully pull 
this off. 
And what we need to be doing here is 
to show States that an 83 percent voter 
turnout in the State of Washington is a 
great victory. A high turnout is a great 
participatory system, and that is what 
we should be striving for with these re-
forms that are about security and 
about our constitutional rights. I hope 
our colleagues will support them. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the following Senators be 
permitted to speak prior to the sched-
uled vote: BLUNT, for up to 15 minutes; 
MERKLEY, for up to 15 minutes; KLO-
BUCHAR, for 10 minutes; and Senator 
SCHUMER, for 5 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

as the old boss. In this case, the new 
bill is the same as the old bill. It has a 
different number, but it still maintains 
the same flawed policies that S. 1 
maintains. 
Obviously, the majority would like to 
pass this bill or they wouldn’t have la-
beled it their most important piece of 
legislation 
for 
this 
Congress. 
The 
House of Representatives labeled the 
same bill, ‘‘H.R. 1,’’ their most impor-
tant piece of legislation for this Con-
gress. 
The changes basically give election 
officials more time to implement poli-
cies that I don’t think we need, and I 
think the changes don’t make the bill 
less bad. In fact, what the bill does is it 
creates a new boss for elections, but 
the new boss is the Federal Govern-
ment. It is not about voting rights. It 
doesn’t add any group or any individ-
uals to the group of people who can 
vote, the kind of thing that Congress 
has done in the past, starting in the 
first century of the country and mov-
ing on until today. It is, frankly, a po-
litically motivated, Federal takeover 
of the election systems that would 
make, in my opinion, elections more 
chaotic, less secure, less nimble in 
their ability to deal with individual 
circumstances that occur on election 
day. 
(Mr. MARKEY assumed the Chair.) 
The strength of the election system 
is the diversity of the election system. 
This is what President Obama thought 
in 2016. He may not still believe that, 
but I still believe it. 
S. 1 would force a single partisan 
view of elections on more than 10,000 
voting jurisdictions across the country, 
taking control away from States, tak-
ing control away from local officials— 
frankly, they are the closest people to 
the voters—and instead giving it to 
people in a far-away national capital 
without the same sense of importance 
of the people believing that what hap-
pened on election day at your precinct 
is what the voters intended to have 
happen that day and that the people 
who were voting were the people who 
were legally able to vote, not people 
who may have voted somewhere else— 
not people who may no longer live in 
the jurisdiction they are voting in and 
no longer qualified to vote for that 
county official or that State represent-
ative or whoever, but people who are 
legally able to vote. 
I think this makes fraud easier to 
commit and, frankly, harder to detect. 
What we should be doing is making it 
easier to vote and harder to cheat. I 
think what we are doing here is mak-
ing it easier to cheat and harder to find 
it out. 
We allow, in this bill, if it was the 
law, unlimited ballot harvesting. This 
is where anybody can go around and 
collect ballots and, theoretically, be 
sure that they get to the election au-
thority, but who knows? Who knows 
what ballot got lost in the mail and 
what ballot never got in the mail? One 
of the things the ballot harvester 
would develop a pretty good sense of is 
how the person voted whose ballot they 
were harvesting. 
This bill undermines popular voter 
ID laws that more than half of the 
States have implemented. 
It makes it more difficult to main-
tain accurate voter lists. 
It permanently tips the scales in 
favor of our friends on the other side 
by politicizing the Federal Election 
Commission—a Commission that was 
established, just like our Ethics Com-
mission in the Senate, with an equal 
number of one party and no imbalance. 
This politicizes the Federal Election 
Commission. It makes it a partisan 
Agency, 
not 
a 
bipartisan 
policing 
Agency. 
It pours Federal funds into cam-
paigns, and it chills free speech—bad 
policy, I think, in search of a problem. 
Democrats have said this is nec-
essary to increase voting rights, par-
ticularly for minorities, but the overall 
turnout in the year 2020 was about two- 
thirds of all the voters—the highest 
percentage of voters who participated 
in over a century. What we have here is 
an election that had the highest level 
of participation in over a century. 
Most States had their highest voter 
turnout in 40 years, and we decide we 
need to change the system. 
S. 1 isn’t just about bad policy; it is 
about what Democrats have seen as a 
political imperative. 
Frankly, this has been the bill that 
Democrats have offered for about the 
last 20 years. It varies a little bit from 
time to time, but about 20 years ago 
and maybe before that. I was a chief 
election official in our State at that 
time. I don’t remember Democrats of-
fering this before 20 years ago. But 
starting about two decades ago, every 
couple of years and certainly every 
time Democrats get in the majority in 
the House, they pass this bill or one al-
most exactly like it. 
When asked about what it would take 
to maintain the current majority in 
the House, Speaker PELOSI said: Well, 
it would be better if we could pass H.R. 
1 and S. 1. Now, that sounds like she 
thinks there is a political advantage 
there. I respect the Speaker’s political 
judgment and always have respected 
Speaker PELOSI’s political judgment. 
Her judgment would be that this would 
be better for Democrats than not 
changing the current election law. 
S. 1 is really full of unnecessary and, 
as it turns out, unpopular provisions 
under the label ‘‘Would you like to 
vote for a bill that would secure de-
mocracy?’’ 
Well, 
of 
course. 
Who 
wouldn’t want to be for securing de-
mocracy? Fortunately, this bill has 
been around long enough that people 
have begun to understand what is in 
it—the same list that has been out 
there before. 
This bill would render State voter ID 
laws meaningless by requiring States 
to allow affidavits in lieu of identifica-
tion. In other words, you say who you 
are at the polling place. Well, anybody 
who is going to try to cast a ballot at 
the polling place they shouldn’t cast is 
probably also likely to be willing to 
say they are qualified to vote at that 
election. 
In a recent poll, a poll that came out 
this week, 80 percent of Americans sup-
ported voter ID laws. Another poll just 
a couple of weeks ago showed national 
support for voter photo ID was 75 per-
cent. That included 69 percent of Black 
voters and 60 percent of Democrats. 
So we have a principal position of 
this bill that 80 percent of all voters— 
at least 75 percent of all voters and 60 
percent of Democrats are for, but this 
bill changes that law that makes sense 
to almost everybody. 
This bill requires that unlimited bal-
lot harvesting that I talked about just 
a minute ago. The only time I recall a 
congressional 
discussion 
recently 
about ballot harvesting was last year 
when the House of Representatives re-
fused to seat a Republican-elected 
Member because that campaign had 
used ballot harvesting. Now we have a 
law that requires every State not to 
prohibit ballot harvesting. The risk of 
fraud, the risk of every ballot not get-
ting to the place ballots need to be cer-
tainly increases when you hand them 
to a ballot harvester—usually some-
body paid by a campaign or a party to 
go around and collect ballots and some-
one whose motivation to get those bal-
lots all turned in may not be every-
thing you want it to be. 
Sixty-two percent of respondents in 
one poll said ballot harvesting should 
be illegal. It is another provision in 
this bill that clearly is not a popular 
provision if people begin to look at it. 
Again, voting to protect democracy— 
sure, that is popular. But the way this 
bill does it, when people look at it, is 
not popular. 
The bill requires States to give felons 
the right to vote in Federal elections 
when they are out of prison. Some 
States do that; some States don’t. Of 
course, if this bill passed, every State 
would have the choice of going ahead 
and doing that or having two sets of 
voter rolls, one for Federal elections 
and another one for non-Federal elec-
tions. That, of course, makes no sense 
at all. What this bill anticipates is that 
no matter what States wanted to do, 
this is a provision they would have to 
adopt. 
There is another way to get that 
done: Go to State legislatures and ex-
plain the value of having that changed 
if that change needs to be made. 
This bill restricts the ability of 
States to maintain accurate voter 
rolls. Many States—States with Demo-
cratic Governors or Democratic secre-
taries of state, Democratic legisla-
tures—have worked hard to see that 
they had a system in place where you 
would periodically check and see if the 
people who are registered to vote are 
still where they registered to vote 
from. 
Our State—I think a lot of States—if 
you move to another county and reg-
ister to vote there, you are supposed to

June 22, 2021 
say as part of that process who you 
could notify to get you off the voter 
rolls, but there is no requirement that 
that has to happen. A periodic check of 
the voter rolls was seen not too long 
ago as a huge protection of democracy. 
This makes it much harder to do. But 
a 2018 poll found that 77 percent of 
Americans supported this kind of voter 
roll maintenance. 
Frankly, it would be pretty hard to 
come up with a bill that had so many 
major tenets that were so out of step 
with what people think the govern-
ment ought to do and what they want 
their State government to do and in 
most cases where State governments 
are doing this. 
This bill provides government fund-
ing for campaigns—$6 of Federal money 
for every dollar raised from small do-
nors. Small donors is under $200. 
Frankly, if you were doing this, there 
would be—the current Members of the 
Senate, under this bill, could receive 
up to, collectively, $1.8 billion from the 
Federal Government to run their cam-
paigns, to attack their challenger, or 
whatever they want to do with their 
campaign money—$1.8 billion to do 
that. It is pretty easy to qualify for 
this money. 
We saw people raise money in the 
first quarter of this year. That would 
have qualified—in the case of our 
friend the Senator from Texas, Senator 
CRUZ, somewhere between $25 and $30 
million would go to his campaign. We 
had a markup on this bill in the Rules 
Committee. Not a single member of the 
Rules Committee, Democrat or Repub-
lican, including Senator CRUZ, thought 
Senator CRUZ should get $24 or $25 mil-
lion from the Federal Government for 
his campaign. 
The bill creates a partisan Federal 
Elections Commission. It gets rid of 
that bipartisan makeup that has been 
there from the very start. 
This bill chills free speech in that it 
creates a disclosure document that 
makes people really reluctant to give 
money to other groups who aren’t can-
didates who like to talk about elec-
tions. 
It federalizes redistricting. S. 1 would 
put in place one set of Federal rules for 
redrawing congressional districts. That 
has always been the role of the States. 
If the State wants to give that to 
somebody besides the legislature, they 
can do that, and many States have 
done that. But States have been the 
constitutionally designated place to 
determine how they draw congressional 
maps in their own States. 
Even if a State manages to comply 
with all these requirements, under this 
bill, the Justice Department would 
have to be involved. Under this bill, the 
court of jurisdiction in all cases on re-
districting would be the Federal court 
in Washington, DC, not the Federal 
court in the circuit that Missouri is in. 
You wouldn’t even start at the district 
court in Kansas City or St. Louis. The 
Federal 
court 
in 
Washington, 
DC, 
would be the place you would go. 
Of course, the purpose of the bill is to 
bring all these election decisions to 
one place. The idea that the best deci-
sions are always made in Washington, 
DC, on all topics is an idea that most 
Americans don’t agree with. There are 
things they think we can do and should 
do and can only do because they can’t 
do them any other way, like defend the 
country and set big national priorities. 
But for well over 200 years now, local 
election officials responsible for the 
sense of credibility of what happens on 
election day have done this job. I think 
they have done it well. 
This bill would require States to take 
burdensome actions and make expen-
sive changes in their election systems. 
Even if the States have already adopt-
ed some of the so-called reforms, they 
in all likelihood would have to make 
changes in their system to comply. 
So the Federal takeover of elections 
shouldn’t happen. I urge my colleagues 
not to support it happening. The Amer-
ican people don’t want to see the 
things imposed on our election system 
that are in this bill. I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this harmful 
legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
every day that I have the honor of 
coming to work in the hallowed halls 
of this building—a symbol to the coun-
try and to the world of America’s com-
mitment to liberty and to justice, free-
dom, and democracy—I am humbled. I 
am humbled by the faith and responsi-
bility that the people of Oregon have 
placed in me to advocate on their be-
half. I am humbled by the responsi-
bility of exercising the power of this of-
fice to use the opportunity to lift up all 
Americans, to create a foundation for 
families to thrive, to tackle significant 
challenges like human rights and glob-
al warming. 
But among all these responsibilities 
one is the highest, which is to defend 
our constitutional Republic, and in 
that Constitution, the single most im-
portant power given to every American 
is the right to a voice and a vote, a 
voice and a vote in the decisions of this 
government and the direction of our 
Nation. 
As we saw all too clearly on January 
6, when this very building was attacked 
by a mob intent on burning the ballots 
of millions of Americans, democracy 
based on free and fair elections is far 
from 
guaranteed. 
Each 
generation, 
each new set of Senators and House 
Members has the responsibility to de-
fend it anew. 
The sad truth, however, is that a vio-
lent mob storming the Capitol isn’t the 
only way to attack our democracy. It 
can also be attacked by the quiet plot-
ting of powerful and privileged individ-
uals who hate the concept of govern-
ment of, by, and for the people, and 
they work to undermine and corrupt 
the 
workings 
of 
our 
Republic 
to 
produce, instead, government by and 
for the powerful. 
In his inaugural address, our second 
President, John Adams, remarked that, 
‘‘we should be unfaithful to ourselves if 
we should ever lose sight of the danger 
to our liberties if anything partial or 
extraneous should infect the purity of 
our free, fair, virtuous, and inde-
pendent elections.’’ 
Well, my friends, our democracy—our 
elections are being infected. Our elec-
tions are under siege from gerry-
mandering, which destroys the prin-
ciple of equal representation. Our sys-
tem is under siege from dark money, 
enabling billionaires and powerful cor-
porations to buy our elections. It is 
under siege by State laws being passed 
week to week right now that target 
specific communities to prevent them 
from voting, thereby manipulating the 
outcome of elections. 
Indeed, at least 22 laws have been en-
acted in 14 States since January to in-
fect our free and fair elections to delib-
erately erect barriers meant to make it 
harder for targeted groups of Ameri-
cans to vote, to silence the voices of 
students and low-income Americans, of 
Native Americans and seniors, of Black 
and Brown Americans who have fought 
too long and too hard to have their 
voice and their vote stolen from them, 
ripped from them now. 
We have a responsibility as United 
States Senators to ensure every Ameri-
can’s freedom to vote, just as this in-
stitution sought to do more than half a 
century ago, when in this Chamber we 
passed the 1965 Voting Rights Act. We 
have a responsibility to ensure that 
every American’s voice is heard and 
that our elections reflect the will of 
the people. 
We can fulfill that responsibility by 
enacting national standards for voting 
to ensure that every American can 
have a say in the key decisions impact-
ing their daily lives, a ‘‘say’’ expressed 
through the ballot box. 
That ballot box is the beating heart 
of our Republic, and those who seek to 
erect barriers to citizens having access 
to it are committing a crime against 
our democracy. We have to stop that 
criminal action against the rights of 
Americans. We must create those na-
tional standards by taking up this bill, 
the For the People bill, debating it, 
and ultimately passing it, to defend 
our Constitution. 
The For the People Act is com-
prehensive. It does popular, common-
sense things to put the American peo-
ple back in charge of their government 
and their country. It sets national 
standards so every American has equal 
freedom to vote, no matter where they 
live. In this country, if you are an 
American, you have the right to vote, 
plain and simple, full stop. It doesn’t 
matter what your ZIP code is or your 
income or the color of your skin or 
your religious beliefs. You have the 
right to vote. 
Many of the State laws restricting 
voting are designed to eliminate early 
voting—in person or by mail—and we 
know exactly why. It is because the

leaders in these States know how easy 
it is to manipulate the vote on election 
day. In these targeted communities, 
the States’ leaders wants to be able to 
decrease the number of polling places, 
reduce the hours, change the locations, 
put polling places in locations with 
limited parking, put out false informa-
tion about the date of the election, and 
purge targeted voters from the roll of 
registered voters, knowing that when 
they show up on election day, it is too 
late to correct the error and be able to 
exercise their right to vote. 
The antidote to these horrendous, 
racist attacks on the freedom and right 
of every American to vote is early vot-
ing in person and by mail, and this act 
guarantees 15 days of early voting. It 
sets forth the opportunity to acquire 
an absentee ballot, to return the ballot 
by 
mail 
or 
through 
dedicated 
dropboxes. 
The second big goal in national 
standards set forth in the For the Peo-
ple Act is to stop billionaires from buy-
ing elections. Elections in America are 
intended to reflect the will of the peo-
ple, not the will of the powerful and 
privileged. Thomas Jefferson once de-
scribed this as the ‘‘mother principle,’’ 
saying that ‘‘governments are repub-
lican only in proportion to how they 
embody the will of the people.’’ 
If the megawealthy can flood our 
campaigns with billions of dollars sent 
through shell companies, untraceable 
money, and manipulate the outcome of 
the elections, then Jefferson’s mother 
principle is murdered because the out-
come serves the powerful, not the peo-
ple. 
The For the People Act says the peo-
ple should have an equal chance of 
being heard and that the people listen-
ing ought to know who is actually be-
hind those voices and those messages. 
It does that by creating an ‘‘honest 
ads’’ policy so political ads people see 
online have to disclose who is paying 
for them, and it does that by requiring 
the disclosure of megadonors contrib-
uting to political campaigns. 
Now, if you or I give a modest dona-
tion to a campaign, that campaign has 
to disclose who we are. Shouldn’t the 
same thing that is true for an average 
American be true for the megadonors? 
This standard sets that equal standard. 
Third, the national standards set 
forth in this bill restore equal rep-
resentation by ending gerrymandering, 
the process by which we draw congres-
sional districts to favor one party over 
another and, by doing so, attack the 
sacred principle of equal representa-
tion. 
This creates a lot of bias in the 
House of Representatives down the 
hall. Take Michigan. In 2012, 2014, and 
2016, the majority of the Michiganders 
voted for one party at every level of 
government, but because of gerry-
mandering, the other party held a deci-
sive advantage in the statehouse, in 
the State senate, and in the congres-
sional House delegation. 
The For the People Act defends, re-
stores the principle of equal represen-
tation. It does it by creating inde-
pendent 
redistricting 
commissions, 
made up equally of Democrats, Repub-
licans, and Independents. That means 
candidates running for office actually 
have to use the power of their ideas, 
the persuasion of their personality, not 
a rigged system to hold power. 
Finally, the standards in this bill 
target corruption by addressing and 
eliminating conflicts of interest. Pub-
lic servants should serve the public, 
not themselves. That includes Members 
of Congress, the administration, and 
for the first time ever, the Supreme 
Court. This bill does that by striking 
down outrageous and corrupt conflicts 
of interest, strengthening divestment 
requirements, saying that the Presi-
dent and Vice President have to use a 
blind trust or limit their personal hold-
ings to assets that don’t pose a poten-
tial conflict of interest. 
It slows the revolving door between 
public service and K Street. It requires 
Cabinet Secretaries to recuse them-
selves from any issues in which a pre-
vious employer or client has a finan-
cial interest. 
The bill requires candidates for Vice 
President or President to disclose their 
tax returns to prevent hidden conflicts 
of interest. It creates a code of ethics 
for the Supreme Court, something all 
other Federal judges already have. 
None of these four principles is about 
helping one political party over the 
other. In fact, the provisions I have 
just laid out are wildly popular among 
the American people. An overwhelming 
supermajority of Democrats, Repub-
licans, and Independents support these 
four principles. It is as bipartisan as 
you can get. 
Even when it is broke into specific 
provisions, three out of four Ameri-
cans—Democrats, Republicans, Inde-
pendents—say they support these re-
forms because they believe in the vi-
sion of government of, by, and for the 
people. It is in our DNA. 
Americans believe that dark money 
should not be able to flood our elec-
tions. They believe billionaires and 
corporations should not be able to buy 
elections. They believe our Nation is 
ill-served by corrupt conflicts of inter-
est. They believe in the vision and 
ideals of our ‘‘we the people’’ Republic, 
and this bill is meant to do just one 
thing: make real the promise of democ-
racy for all Americans. 
But powerful special interests don’t 
want that. It threatens their hold on 
power by ending the ways they have 
rigged the system, and so they are all 
about striking down this bill. 
Why is that? We hear how Republican 
leaders say that they like this rigged 
system. Apparently, they like dark 
money in campaigns helping to buy 
elections. Apparently, they like tar-
geting groups of individuals to prevent 
them from voting, taking us back to 
the racist efforts that existed before 
the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Appar-
ently, 
they 
like 
gerrymandering, 
thinking it is a sort of the political 
power down the hall, which political 
scientists says it is. But should it be 
principle or power that we fight for 
here? 
It should be the principle and the 
oath of office we took to uphold the 
Constitution. 
Standing before a crowd on a Novem-
ber afternoon to dedicate the Soldiers’ 
National Cemetery at Gettysburg, 4 
months after that momentous battle, 
President Lincoln remarked that they 
were gathered together to not only 
dedicate it to the men who had fallen 
in battle, but to the ideal for which 
they gave their lives, ‘‘That govern-
ment of the people, by the people, for 
the people, shall not perish from the 
Earth.’’ 
Today, it is our responsibility to 
carry that ideal forward and to ensure 
that government of the people, by the 
people, and for the people shall not per-
ish from the United States of America. 
We in this Chamber must pass the For 
the People Act. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk 
will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Without ob-
jection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
today the Senate is voting on whether 
to consider the For the People Act, 
also known as S. 1. I encourage all my 
colleagues to support Senate consider-
ation of this crucial election reform 
bill. 
This legislation would put a stop to 
new State laws across the country that 
are making it harder for Americans to 
register to vote and to cast their bal-
lots. So far this year, at least 389 bills 
to suppress the ability to vote have 
been introduced in 48 States. At least 
22 of these new bills have become law 
in 14 States. 
These newly enacted laws undermine 
the right to vote from every direction: 
They create new and unnecessarily 
strict voter ID laws, which make it 
harder to vote for the 11 percent of U.S. 
citizens who do not have a government- 
issued photo ID, many of whom are el-
derly or low-income. They reduce the 
timeframes for early voting, a critical 
method of voting for many working 
Americans. And they impose severe 
limitations on voting by mail, a strat-
egy that many States have used to sig-
nificantly increase voter turnout over 
recent years. 
These attacks have shown no signs of 
letting up. In Texas, a restrictive vot-
ing bill is pending before the State leg-
islature that continues to get worse 
the longer it is considered. In its cur-
rent form, the Texas bill would cut 
early voting hours, ban drive-through 
voting, limit vote-by-mail, and add 
new voter ID requirements for mail-in 
ballots, along with a host of other re-
strictions on the right to vote.

S4683 
June 22, 2021 
These restrictions are harmful to our 
democracy. We should be working to 
make it easier for more people to vote, 
not making it harder. The right to vote 
is a bedrock principle of our democ-
racy. Unfortunately, many States are 
using unfounded conspiracy theories of 
voter fraud as an excuse to pass laws to 
weaken that fundamental right. 
That is why we must pass the For the 
People Act. This bill will help to en-
sure that all Americans are able to 
vote, free of unnecessary hurdles and 
burdens. It includes a number of com-
monsense reforms that anyone who be-
lieves in the health of our democracy 
cannot possibly oppose in good con-
science. 
For example, one provision of S. 1 re-
quires that States allow voters to reg-
ister to vote online. In an age when 
you can cash a check, buy a car, and 
conduct a doctor’s appointment en-
tirely online, there is no reason a voter 
should not be able to register to vote 
online. 
The bill also invests in the health of 
our election infrastructure by securing 
our voting systems against foreign at-
tacks. The security of our voting sys-
tems should not be a partisan issue. 
In addition, S. 1 would ban partisan 
gerrymandering and require States to 
draw 
their 
congressional 
districts 
using independent redistricting com-
missions, like we do in California. Vot-
ers should be able to choose their rep-
resentatives; 
representatives 
should 
not be able to choose their voters. 
We need to empower the voice of 
every American in our democracy. We 
need to make these commonsense re-
forms to our elections. 
I understand that some of my col-
leagues have disagreements with spe-
cific parts of the bill. I would urge 
them to let the legislation come before 
the Senate and seek to amend it. But 
to deny this body the ability to even 
debate and consider such an important 
bill as this is unacceptable. 
The time for these reforms is now. I 
hope that my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle will support this important 
legislation. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I come to the floor to speak in support 
of proceeding to debate legislation that 
is critical to our democracy, legisla-
tion that is based on two simple ideas: 
that Americans must be able to freely 
choose their elected officials and that 
government must be accountable to 
the people, not to those with the most 
money. These are not Democratic or 
Republican ideas; they are core Amer-
ican ideas. But for too long, these 
rights have been under attack, which is 
why we need the critical democracy re-
forms in the For the People Act. 
I am honored to be leading this legis-
lation with Senators MERKLEY
and 
SCHUMER and to have worked with my 
colleagues as chair of the Rules Com-
mittee, worked with my colleagues in 
the House and civil rights and democ-
racy reform groups and you, Madam 
President, to bring this bill forward 
today. 
The freedom to vote is fundamental 
to all of our freedoms. It is how Ameri-
cans control their government and hold 
elected officials accountable. It is the 
bedrock of our government. It is the 
founding principle of our country, and 
it has stood the test of wars, of eco-
nomic strife, and yes, a global pan-
demic. But protecting this right has 
not always been easy. 
Throughout our country’s 245-year 
history, we have had to course-correct 
and take action to ensure that democ-
racy is for the people and by the people 
and that it has lived up to our ideals. 
At the beginning of this year, we 
were reminded on January 6 that it is 
up to us to protect against threats to 
our democracy, to ensure that it suc-
ceeds. 
I still remember that moment at 3:30 
in the morning when Senator BLUNT 
and I and, yes, Vice President Pence 
walked from this Chamber with the 
two young women with the mahogany 
box full of those last ballots to get over 
to the House to finish our job so that 
you, Madam President, were declared 
the Vice President and President Biden 
was declared the President. That is up-
holding our democracy. That is doing 
it together, Democrats and Repub-
licans doing our job. And what this bill 
is about to me, this bill is about car-
rying on that torch to protect our de-
mocracy. 
Today, the vote to begin debate on 
this legislation will likely get the sup-
port of all 50 Democrats. Senator 
MANCHIN, along with the rest of our 
caucus, has made clear to the country 
that standing up for the right to vote is 
bigger than any one person or thing. It 
is about us. It is about us as Ameri-
cans. I deeply appreciate the work he 
has put into the proposal he is putting 
forward today, and I look forward to 
continuing our discussions with him. 
He is doing this in good faith. There 
are many good things in that proposal. 
And today we are here together to reaf-
firm we will not give up this fight. It is 
just beginning. 
The 2020 election showed that you 
can make it safer to vote while giving 
voters the options that work for them. 
If it is vote-by-mail—I see my col-
league Senator SMITH here. Minnesota 
is so proud of our same-day registra-
tion. That has worked for us. It has 
made us No. 1 in voter turnout in the 
country time and time and time again. 
Many States during the pandemic took 
steps exactly like that, extending op-
tions for voters, like safe vote-by mail, 
and now 34 States have no-excuse vote- 
by-mail—34 States. The result? More 
than nearly 160 million Americans 
voted—more than ever before and in 
the middle of a pandemic. 
I still remember those voters in the 
primary 
in 
Wisconsin 
standing 
in 
makeshift garbage bags with makeshift 
masks over their faces in the middle of 
a rainstorm, in the middle of a pan-
demic, standing in line to vote. And in 
an election that the Trump Depart-
ment of Homeland Security declared 
was the most secure in our history, the 
American people elected, yes, Presi-
dent Joe Biden and Vice President 
KAMALA HARRIS. 
But in the wake of that historic elec-
tion, there has been a pervasive, co-
ordinated, and overwhelming effort to 
undermine the freedoms of voting in 
future elections, with over 400 bills in-
troduced in legislatures across the 
country. Twenty-two laws to restrict 
voting have been enacted in 14 States, 
and 31 more bills to roll back the right 
to vote have passed at least 1 chamber 
of a State legislature. 
As Reverend WARNOCK put it in this 
Chamber in his maiden speech as Sen-
ator, ‘‘Some people don’t want some 
people to vote.’’ That is what is going 
on here. 
The new law in Georgia makes it 
harder to request mail-in ballots, dras-
tically limits ballot drop boxes, and 
makes it a crime to hand water and 
food to voters waiting in line to cast 
their ballots, when in previous elec-
tions, Georgians have stood in line for 
up to 10 hours to vote. 
One of the new Montana laws ended 
same-day registration on election day 
after it had been in practice in the 
State for 15 years, and Senator TESTER 
is joining me in trying to bring this 
practice across—when we introduced 
that bill—across the Nation. 
In the weeks ahead, similar bills are 
expected to pass in even more States, 
including Texas, where the Governor 
has promised to call the legislature 
into special session to pass a bill to re-
strict voting that was blocked at the 
end of regular session thanks to the he-
roic efforts of Democrats in the Texas 
State Legislature who blessed us with 
their presence just last week. 
These are not empty threats; they 
are real efforts to disenfranchise reg-
ular Americans from voting—senior 
citizens, people with disabilities, peo-
ple who can’t stand in line for 10 hours 
just to wait to vote. 
In the face of these efforts to roll 
back voting rights in so many States, 
the For the People Act is about setting 
basic national standards to make sure 
that all voters in this country can vote 
legally in the way that works for them, 
regardless of which ZIP Code they live 
in, regardless of whether they live in a 
big city or in a suburb or out in a small 
town in western Minnesota. It is about 
reducing the power of Big Money in our 
elections by ending secret spending by 
billionaires and special interests. It is 
about making anti-corruption reforms 
to ensure that politicians work for the 
people, not for themselves. 
Republicans have said that this bill 
is designed to provide a political ad-
vantage, but, as a former Republican 
Commissioner of the Federal Election 
Commission who chaired under George 
Bush, Trevor Potter, has said in ex-
plaining his support for this bill—and 
he appeared as a witness in my hearing 
for this bill—he said: 
This bill does not give power to any par-
ticular party over another; it gives power 
back to the voters.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4684 
June 22, 2021 
Giving power back to the voters is 
exactly what we need. 
There is an amplified attack on the 
right to vote this year, but we have 
seen serious efforts to restrict voting 
rights since the Supreme Court gutted 
the Voting Rights Act 8 years ago. The 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 marked the 
cornerstone achievement to the civil 
rights movement and became a law be-
cause of the tireless work of people 
like John Lewis who put their lives on 
the line to secure voting rights for all. 
Fifty-six years later, we are still fight-
ing that battle. At the same time, we 
haven’t had meaningful campaign fi-
nance or ethics reform. 
Our democracy desperately needs the 
proposals in this bill. And guess what. 
The American people agree. Yes, this 
bill is bipartisan, except right here in 
this place. It is bipartisan because one 
poll released recently found that 78 
percent of Americans, including 63 per-
cent of Republicans, support making 
early in-person voting available for at 
least 2 weeks before election day. That 
is a proposal in our original For the 
People, and it is in the managers’ 
amendment that we are voting for clo-
ture on, and it is in Senator MANCHIN’s 
proposal. 
Another poll found that 83 percent of 
likely voters support public disclosure 
of contributions to groups involved in 
elections—also the DISCLOSE Act in 
all three proposals. Yet some of my Re-
publican colleagues want to limit dis-
closures. By the way, disclosures were 
championed by Justice Scalia. Yet 
what happened in our committee hear-
ing on this, our markup? Republicans 
filed amendment after amendment to 
gut those provisions of the bill. 
So while they make claims—my 
friends on the other side of the aisle— 
that this isn’t popular, it is just not 
true. They claim it is not bipartisan. It 
is just not true. The bill contains nine 
bipartisan bills, including the Honest 
Ads Act, which I first introduced with 
Senator John McCain and Senator 
WARNER, and now Senator LINDSAY 
GRAHAM took up that cause. Our provi-
sion—that provision would finally hold 
the social media companies account-
able to make sure that there are dis-
claimers and disclosures on political 
ads. 
There is the work that I have done 
with Senator LANKFORD and with you, 
Madam President, when you were in 
the Senate to make sure we have 
backup paper ballots. We still have 
eight States that don’t have backup 
paper ballots. That provision is in this 
bill. 
Many of the bill’s provisions have al-
ready been adopted in red, blue, and 
purple States and have the support of 
Governors and election officials from 
both parties. 
Twenty-one States have same-day 
voter registration, including red States 
like Idaho, Wyoming, and Iowa. That is 
great, but our question should be, why 
don’t all 50 States have it, especially 
when the Constitution of the United 
States specifically says that Congress 
can make and alter rules for Federal 
elections? It is as clear as the words on 
the page. Twenty States have auto-
matic voter registration laws, includ-
ing Alaska, Georgia, and West Vir-
ginia. Forty-five States allowed all 
voters to vote by mail in the 2020 elec-
tion, and 44 States have early voting. 
What this bill does is takes the best 
of the best and puts in place minimum 
standards so that no matter what State 
you call home, you have access to the 
ballot 
box. 
That 
is 
why 
Senator 
MERKLEY has worked so hard on this 
legislation. That is why Senator SCHU-
MER made this bill Senate file No. 1. 
The bill that we are voting to ad-
vance includes changes that directly 
respond to concerns about implementa-
tion from both Democratic and Repub-
lican States and local officials. We 
heard those concerns, and the Demo-
crats on the Rules Committee, which 
included Senator WARNER and Senator 
KING—we worked on that managers’ 
amendment and made it easier for 
rural areas, extended the time system, 
and got at their concerns. And then 
Senator MANCHIN has come up with 
more ideas and more things we can do 
to make the bill strong. 
We heard from election officials that 
requiring States to accept mail-in bal-
lots for too long after election day 
would delay them from certifying the 
results, so we shortened the window. 
I could go on and on and on. In good 
faith, we have worked to make this bill 
work for America, and now it is time 
to allow for debate on this bill. 
Our Republican friends on the other 
side of the aisle say this bill—this is 
one thing Senator MCCONNELL would 
say in the hearing—that it would cause 
chaos. I say this: Chaos is a 5-hour wait 
to vote. Senior citizens standing in the 
hot Sun for 5 hours, for 10 hours—that 
is chaos. Chaos is purging eligible vot-
ers from voter rolls and modern-day 
poll taxes and one ballot box for a 
county of 5 million people, which is ex-
actly what they did in Harris County, 
TX. That is exactly what is happening 
in that State right now. Chaos is voters 
in Wisconsin waiting in line to vote for 
hours in the rain in their homemade 
masks and plastic garbage bags. The 
angry mob on January 6 that came into 
this very Chamber, that spray painted 
the columns, that attacked police offi-
cers, that injured people left and 
right—that is chaos. 
As I said from the stage on Inaugura-
tion Day under that bright blue sky 
where you could still see the spray 
paint at the bottom of those columns 
and the makeshift windows we had in 
place—I said this: This is the day our 
democracy picks itself up, brushes off 
the dust, and does what America al-
ways does: goes forward as a Nation 
under God, with liberty and justice for 
all. We cannot do that if Americans are 
disenfranchised, if they are not part of 
our democracy. 
Republicans have sadly made it clear 
that this is not legislation they are 
willing to negotiate or even debate. 
They won’t even give it a week. They 
won’t even give it a few days. Just last 
week, they held a press conference to 
tell the American people that they 
don’t believe Congress should act to 
protect the right to vote or get rid of 
secret money in our elections. So, hon-
estly, I would love to get support from 
the other side of the aisle, but we have 
to be honest—I don’t expect we are 
going to get it. 
So, my Republican colleagues, this is 
not the end of the line for this bill. 
This is not the end of the line. This is 
only the beginning because if you have 
your way, those voters won’t even be at 
the end of the line. They are not going 
to be able to vote. 
In the Rules Committee, we will be 
holding a series of hearings—not just 
one hearing, a series of hearings—and 
we are taking it on the road for the 
first time in a long time. We are going 
to Georgia and holding a field hearing 
there so we can hear firsthand from 
people in the State on what is hap-
pening and why we must carry out the 
constitutional duty in this Chamber to 
act. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
recognize the work being done in 
States to restrict the freedom of Amer-
icans to exercise their sacred right to 
vote. Our Nation was founded on the 
ideals of democracy, and we have seen 
for ourselves in this building how we 
can never take it for granted. 
We can’t let State legislatures get to 
pick and choose who votes and what 
votes get counted. That is not how de-
mocracy works. I urge all of my col-
leagues to do what the American peo-
ple are asking us to do and to do what 
is right. Vote today to bring us closer 
to passing legislation to strengthen our 
democracy. We can’t wait in line, and 
we can’t make the people of America 
wait in line. The time to do this is now. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, let me thank so many of my col-
leagues, including our chair of Rules, 
the Senator from Minnesota; our lead 
sponsor on this bill, Senator MERKLEY; 
and so many others who have done so 
much on this legislation. 
Now, what makes a democracy a de-
mocracy? It is the right of citizens to 
choose their own leader; to forge their 
own destiny, rather than have it de-
cided for them; the right to vote; the 
right that generations of Americans 
have marched and protested to achieve; 
women who reached for the ballot; and 
marchers who were bloodied on a 
bridge in Selma; the right that genera-
tions of American soldiers fought and 
died to defend, buried now in patriot 
graves from Normandy to Gettysburg. 
And, right now, it is a fact—a fact— 
that voting rights are under assault in 
America in a way that we have not 
seen in many, many decades. Repub-
lican State legislatures are limiting 
polling hours, locations, and ballot

drop boxes, raising new ID barriers for 
students, making it a crime to give 
food and water to voters in line, and in 
States like Texas, trying to move Sun-
day voting hours so it is harder for 
Black churchgoers to go to the polls 
after services. 
It is the most sweeping voter sup-
pression effort in at least 80 years, tar-
geting all the ways that historically 
disenfranchised 
voters—Black 
and 
Brown Americans, students, the work-
ing poor—access the ballot. 
We can disagree about solutions to 
this problem, about which policies 
might be more effective, but we should 
all agree this is a problem. We should 
all agree that protecting voting rights 
is worthy of debate, and that is what 
this next vote is about. Should the U.S. 
Senate even debate—even debate—how 
to protect the voting rights of our citi-
zens? 
The story of American democracy is 
full 
of 
contradictions 
and 
halting 
progress. At the time of our Constitu-
tion’s ratification, you had to be, in 
most States, a White, male, Protestant 
landowner to vote. How many in this 
Chamber—how many of us would have 
been able to participate in those first 
elections? 
The truth is, many of us, particularly 
on our side of the aisle, would not have 
been able to vote. But ever since the 
early days of the Republic, Americans 
launched mighty movements, fought a 
bloody civil war, and, yes, passed Fed-
eral election laws to expand the fran-
chise until there were no more bound-
aries. 
Are we in a backslide here in the 21st 
century? Are we going to let reac-
tionary State legislatures drag us back 
into the muck of voter suppression? 
Are we going to let the most dishonest 
President in history continue to poison 
our democracy from the inside or will 
we stand up to defend what generations 
of Americans have organized, marched 
for, and died for—the sacred, sacred 
right to vote, the thing that makes a 
democracy a democracy. 
I plead with my Republican col-
leagues. Stand up, my Republican col-
leagues. Stand up to a man who has 
lied. We all know he has lied. You 
know he has lied about our elections. 
Do not let this man lead you around by 
the nose and do permanent damage to 
our democracy. At least have the de-
cency and honor to let this Chamber 
debate. I urge my colleagues to vote 
yes. 
I yield the floor.

The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, 
the yeas are 50, the nays are 50. 
Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn not having voted in the 
affirmative, the motion is rejected. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Mr. Majority 
Leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
want to be clear about what just hap-
pened on the Senate floor. Every single 
Senate Republican just voted against 
starting debate—starting debate—on 
legislation to protect Americans’ vot-
ing rights. Once again, the Senate Re-
publican minority has launched a par-
tisan blockade of a pressing issue here 
in the U.S. Senate, an issue no less fun-
damental than the right to vote. 
I have laid out the facts for weeks. 
Republican State legislatures across 
the country are engaged in the most 
sweeping voter suppression in 80 years, 
capitalizing on and catalyzed by Don-
ald Trump’s Big Lie. These State gov-
ernments are making it harder for 
younger, poorer, urban, and non-White 
Americans to vote. 
Earlier today, the Republican leader 
told reporters that ‘‘regardless of what 
may be happening in some States, 
there’s no rationale for Federal inter-
vention.’’ The Republican leader flatly 
stated that no matter what the States 
do to undermine our democracy—voter 
suppression laws, phony audits, par-
tisan takeovers of the local election 
boards—the Senate should not act. 
My colleagues, if Senators 60 years 
ago held that the Federal Government 
should never intervene to protect vot-
ing rights, this body would have never 
passed the Voting Rights Act. The Re-
publican leader uses the language and 
the logic of the southern Senators in 
the 1960s who defended States’ rights, 
and it is an indefensible position for 
any Senator—any Senator—let alone 
the minority leader, to hold. Yet that 
was the reason given for why Repub-
licans voted in lockstep today: Regard-
less of what may be happening in some 
States, there is no rationale for Fed-
eral intervention. 
That is both ridiculous and awful. All 
we wanted to do here on the floor was 
to bring up the issue of voting rights 
and debate how to combat these vi-
cious, oftentimes discriminatory vot-
ing restrictions, and today, every sin-
gle Democratic Senator stood together 
in the fight to protect the right to vote 
in America. The Democratic Party in 
the Senate will always stand united to 
defend our democracy. 
I spoke with President Biden earlier 
this afternoon as well. He has been 
unshakeable in his support of S. 1, and 
I want to thank the President and the 
Vice President for their efforts. But re-
grettably—regrettably—our 
efforts 
were met by the unanimous opposition 
of the Senate minority. 
Once again, Senate Republicans have 
signed their names in the ledger of his-
tory alongside Donald Trump, the Big 
Lie, and voter suppression, to their en-
during 
disgrace. 
This 
vote, 
I 
am 
ashamed to say, is further evidence 
that voter suppression has become part 
of the official platform of the Repub-
lican Party. 
Now, Republican Senators may have 
prevented us from having a debate on 
voting rights today, but I want to be 
very clear about one thing: The fight 
to protect voting rights is not over, by 
no means. In the fight for voting 
rights, this vote was the starting gun, 
not the finish line. Let me say that 
again. In the fight for voting rights, 
this vote was the starting gun, not the 
finish line. 
As many have noted, including my 
friend Senator WARNOCK this morning,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4686 
June 22, 2021 
when John Lewis was about to cross 
that bridge in Selma, he didn’t know 
what waited for him on the other side. 
He didn’t know how long his march 
would be, and his ultimate success was 
never guaranteed, but he started down 
that bridge anyway. Today, Democrats 
started our march to defend the voting 
rights of all Americans. It could be a 
long march, but it is one we are going 
to make. 
Today, we made progress. For the 
first time in this Congress, we got all 
50 Democrats unified behind moving 
forward on a strong and comprehensive 
voting rights bill. And make no mis-
take about it, it will not be the last 
time that voting rights comes up for a 
debate in the Senate. 
Republicans may want to avoid the 
topic, hoping that their party’s efforts 
to suppress votes and defend the Big 
Lie will go unnoticed. Democrats will 
not allow that. Democrats will never 
let this voter suppression be swept 
under the rug. 
We have several serious options for 
how to reconsider this issue and ad-
vance legislation to combat voter sup-
pression. We are going to explore every 
last one of our options. We have to. 
Voting rights are too important, too 
fundamental. This concerns the very 
core of our democracy and what we are 
about as a nation, so we will not let it 
go. We will not let it die. This voter 
suppression cannot stand, and we are 
going to work tirelessly to see that it 
does not stand. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk 
will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am delighted to follow the majority 
leader and his strong remarks about 
the beginning of the process of passing 
S. 1, not only to deal with the question 
of voting rights but to deal with the 
question of the dark money plague that 
is infesting our democracy and taking 
the power over decision making in this 
body and in this building away from 
regular people and putting it into the 
hands of not only special interests but 
of special interests who are happy to 
operate in secret. 
One of the ways in which this power 
has been deployed has been with re-
spect to the judicial branch of govern-
ment. And I am here now for my third 
speech in ‘‘The Scheme’’ series to draw 
attention to this problem. 
In the first two ‘‘Scheme’’ speeches, I 
described the corporate power game 
plan offered by lawyer Lewis Powell to 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the 
subsequent effectuation of that game 
plan by Justice Lewis Powell, ap-
pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court 2 
months—2 months—after his secret 
corporate power game plan went to the 
chamber. The execution of the Powell 
plan was one of three converging 
threads that led to the scheme to cap-
ture the Court. 
The Powell plan, thread one, was a 
political response recommended for 
America’s traditional corporate elite, 
which had been traumatized by the so-
cial upheaval of the 1960s. The second 
thread, thread two, was a separate 
strain of American ire that had been 
simmering on our society’s fringe for 
many decades. The extremists on this 
simmering fringe were traumatized by 
things long accepted as mainstream by 
most Americans. 
The fringe resentments shifted with 
the varying tides of news and events 
but regularly boiled over against sev-
eral targets. One was the role of Jewish 
people in finance, the press, Hollywood, 
and—after FDR—in government. An-
other was the improving economic and 
social condition of minorities. Another 
was the arrival of immigrants, particu-
larly non-European immigrants; but 
backlash to immigration from Ireland 
and Italy had been profound, as my 
home State experienced back under the 
Know-Nothings. 
Other 
resentments 
sprang from imaginary events, con-
spiracy theory delusions, and crackpot 
ideas. 
This 
persistent 
strain 
along 
the 
American fringe was chronicled in Pul-
itzer 
Prize-winning 
Richard 
Hofstadter’s 1964 essay, ‘‘The Paranoid 
Style in American Politics,’’ later a 
popular book. This latent strain of 
paranoid extremism showed itself in 
groups like the John Birch Society, 
which never gained social or political 
acceptance. It was fed and nurtured by 
a handful of rightwing foundations set 
up by a few colossally rich and politi-
cally irate and frustrated families. It 
boiled up in the Presidential campaign 
of Senator Barry Goldwater, which 
ended in one of the worst landslide de-
feats in American history. It drove the 
occasional aspirations of the Liber-
tarian Party, whose extremist platform 
suffered predictable but humiliating 
crushings at the polls. All of this de-
feat, over all of these decades, con-
centrated the strain, isolated its most 
persistent and determined elements, 
and added to it an emotional payload 
of resentment. 
One target of this fringe was the ex-
istence of government regulation. The 
Libertarian Party, in 1980, ran on a 
platform of ending Social Security, 
ending Medicare, closing the post of-
fice, undoing the American highway 
program, stopping public education, 
and eliminating all our public regu-
latory 
agencies—even 
the 
Federal 
Aviation Administration that keeps 
planes from bumping into each other. 
This platform barely attracted 1 per-
cent of the vote, an unsurprising but 
humiliating 
crushing. 
That 
humiliating crushing was suffered by 
David Koch, Libertarian Party can-
didate for Vice President, and the par-
ty’s major funder. The Koch family is 
spectacularly, unimaginably rich. Pri-
vately held Koch Industries pours hun-
dreds of millions of dollars into their 
pockets every year. The family annual 
income exceeds most families’ dreams 
of lifetime wealth. The Kochs have so-
cial ambition, putting their names on 
educational TV programs, art centers, 
and university buildings. They are not 
the sort of people who take humilia-
tion well. They are also not stupid, and 
the family has long and sometimes 
dark international experience, includ-
ing odious efforts in previous decades 
to build factories for evil regimes. 
Made confident by the arrogance of 
wealth, driven by extremist ideology, 
spurred 
by 
the 
resentment 
of 
humiliating political rejection, experi-
enced in the devious ways of the inter-
national world, steeped in the cor-
porate skills of long-term planning and 
patient execution, and with unlimited 
resources to indulge themselves, the 
Koch brothers, Charles and David, were 
uniquely positioned to take this long-
standing, latent, extremist fringe and 
amplify it and direct it, by plan, in se-
cret, and over decades if need be. 
If front groups needed to be set up, so 
be it; subsidiaries were a familiar con-
cept. 
If 
identities 
needed 
to 
be 
laundered off money they gave, so be 
it; telling lawyers to find or design a 
way to do that was familiar. If fringe 
groups needed to be coordinated to 
work collectively with each other, so 
be it; organizing with others through 
trade associations and lobbying groups 
was familiar activity. And if money 
needed to be spent, well, so be it; 
money was no object, and getting peo-
ple to do things for you for money is a 
familiar practice of the very rich. 
The nurture and guidance of the 
Kochs breathed new strength and life— 
and deregulatory purpose—into the na-
tivist far-right fringe. Meanwhile, in 
the regulatory arena, waited the third 
of the three threads. Major corporate 
interests—from the railroads first to 
banks, chemical companies, and pol-
luting industries—had assembled, over 
time, a quietly powerful presence to 
help them in administrative Agencies; 
to make sure that regulation was 
friendly to business, and, even more 
than 
that, 
under 
the 
right 
cir-
cumstances, with the right people and 
pressures, could be turned to advantage 
of the regulated industry. 
In 
administrative 
hearings 
and 
rulemakings, regulated industries reg-
ularly 
outgunned 
public 
interest 
groups. Law firms dedicated to this lu-
crative corporate regulatory practice 
sprouted. Gleaming stables were kept 
of well-tended professional witnesses 
who could reliably spout the corporate 
line in Agency proceedings. 
Companies played the long game in 
these regulatory Agencies, of accreting 
minor victories, step-by-step, inch-by- 
inch, but that together summed up to 
major gains. Many of these gains were 
deeply buried in the weeds of arcane

policy and technical detail, inscrutable 
to the general media and so invisible to 
the general public. 
Revolving doors spun between regu-
latory Commissions and industry, so 
that Agency decision makers often re-
flected the values, priorities and inter-
ests of the regulated industry, not the 
general public. At the extreme, the reg-
ulatory Agency became servant to the 
industry master—a phenomenon well 
known and well documented as regu-
latory capture. I wrote a separate book 
on this, ‘‘Captured,’’ so I won’t dwell 
on it at great length here. It is enough 
to note that regulatory capture is so 
common that it has been a robust field 
of academic research and writing now 
for decades, both in economics and in 
administrative law. 
So these three socioeconomic strands 
converged. America’s regular corporate 
elite took up the Powell memo strat-
egy of emboldened political engage-
ment, seeking to reclaim their power 
and restrain the unwelcome changes 
roiling American society. The extrem-
ists of great wealth brought to the 
rightwing fringe and its motley array 
of extremist groups an unprecedented 
strategic 
discipline, 
unlimited 
re-
sources, and the tactics of hard-edged 
corporate organization. The regulatory 
capture apparatus was there for the 
hiring, eager to pursue the new pros-
pects offered by big industries and ec-
centric billionaires. Out of this slum-
gullion of immense wealth, extreme po-
litical ambition, and expertise at regu-
latory capture, how long would it take 
for people to start thinking about cap-
turing not just regulatory Agencies but 
courts—indeed 
the 
U.S. 
Supreme 
Court? 
As it turned out, not long. The Court 
had made itself a target of the right-
wing. Brown v. Board of Education pro-
voked massive resistance across the 
South out to defend segregated public 
schools. Roe v. Wade provoked, as it 
still provokes, the religious right. So 
did Engel v. Vitale, restricting prayer 
in schools. Griswold v. Connecticut of-
fended those upset by the sixties sexual 
revolution. Miranda v. Arizona, Mapp 
v. Ohio, and Gideon v. Wainwright of-
fended the tough-on-crime crowd. To 
the far right, the Supreme Court of-
fered a bounty of things to hate. Even 
without the Powell Memo’s corporate 
plan of ‘‘exploiting judicial action’’ 
‘‘with 
an 
activist-minded 
Supreme 
Court,’’ the Court would likely have 
been an irresistible target. 
But with that plan and that rec-
ommendation, it began to come to-
gether. 
And 
so 
the 
scheme 
was 
launched, fed by three political tribu-
taries: one, the corporate plan in Lewis 
Powell’s memo to the Chamber; two, 
the resurgent Koch-powered, far-right 
fringe; and three, the eager, available 
mercenaries of regulatory capture. 
The effort to capture the Court has 
likely been the most effectual deploy-
ment of rightwing and corporate re-
sources into our common American po-
litical life, and America is now a very 
different place as a result of it. Much of 
it, like the proverbial frog in the pro-
verbial pot, we have even gotten used 
to, and we accept it now as normal, 
when it isn’t. 
To be continued. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
to celebrate a win for the country. 
Today, the United States rightfully 
failed to advance the ‘‘Corrupt Politi-
cians Act,’’ meaning that this bill will 
not come to the Senate floor for a final 
vote. This is a huge win for the citizens 
of the United States. This is a huge win 
for democracy, and it is a huge win for 
the integrity of our elections. 
The ‘‘Corrupt Politicians Act’’ is the 
most dangerous legislation we consid-
ered in the Senate in the 9 years I 
served in this body. It is an attempt by 
Senate Democrats at a brazen power 
grab. It is an attempt by Democrats to 
federalize elections and to ensure that 
Democrats won’t lose control for the 
next 100 years. 
This bill isn’t about protecting the 
right to vote. It is precisely the oppo-
site. It is about taking away the right 
to vote from the citizens and giving it 
instead to the corrupt politicians in 
Washington who want to stay in power. 
The ‘‘Corrupt Politicians Act’’ would 
strike down virtually every common-
sense voter integrity law adopted by 
States across the country. Thirty-six 
States have adopted voter ID laws, a 
reasonable and commonsense step to 
protect the integrity of elections that 
over 70 percent of Americans support 
and over 60 percent of African Ameri-
cans support. In fact, recent polling 
now shows support for voter ID at over 
80 percent, thanks, no doubt, to the re-
lentless assault to voter ID mounted by 
Senate Democrats. The ‘‘Corrupt Poli-
ticians Act’’ would repeal the vast ma-
jority of these voter ID laws. 
Likewise, 31 States prohibit ballot 
harvesting, the corrupt practice of pay-
ing political operatives to collect other 
people’s ballots. What would the ‘‘Cor-
rupt Politicians Act’’ do? It would 
strike down all of those laws in 31 
States and would mandate ballot har-
vesting nationwide. It would mean that 
paid 
political 
operatives 
from 
the 
Democratic National Committee could 
go to nursing homes and collect votes— 
some of those votes, no doubt, from in-
dividuals who may be no longer com-
petent to make a decision. The reason 
31 States have acted to ban ballot har-
vesting is it invites voter fraud. An un-
scrupulous operative can fill out the 
ballot for a senior citizen who no 
longer has the capacity to make a deci-
sion, and if that senior citizen has the 
temerity to vote in a way the operative 
doesn’t like, there is nothing to pre-
vent the operative from throwing that 
ballot in the mail and simply not send-
ing it in, only sending in the ballots 
that happen to comply with their own 
political preference. If you care even 
one whit about election integrity, 
striking down every prohibition on bal-
lot harvesting is precisely the wrong 
step to take. 
The ‘‘Corrupt Politicians Act’’ would 
also automatically register to vote 
anyone who comes in contact with the 
government. So if you get a welfare 
check, 
you 
get 
an 
unemployment 
check, you get a driver’s license, you 
go to a State college or State univer-
sity, you are automatically registered 
to vote. What is the problem with that? 
The problem with that, as the authors 
of the bill know, is that would register 
millions of illegal aliens to vote. Mil-
lions of illegal aliens come into con-
tact with the government, and auto-
matic registration is designed to reg-
ister millions of illegal aliens. 
How do we know this? We know this, 
among other things, because the bill 
explicitly immunizes the State offi-
cials who would be registering illegal 
aliens to vote. It grants a safe harbor 
and says, when you illegally register il-
legal aliens, you will have no liability. 
If you care about the integrity of elec-
tions, registering millions of illegal 
aliens to dilute and steal the votes of 
legal American citizens is exactly the 
opposite way to go. 
Not only that, many States have rea-
sonable restrictions on felons and on 
criminals voting. What does the ‘‘Cor-
rupt Politicians Act’’ do? It strikes all 
of those down and instead mandates 
that all felons should be allowed to 
vote—murderers, rapists, child molest-
ers all allowed to vote because Demo-
crats have made the cynical calcula-
tion that if millions of illegal aliens 
are allowed to vote and millions of 
criminals and felons are allowed to 
vote, that those individuals are likely 
to vote Democrat and Democrats want 
to stay in power. 
The bill also prevents States from 
correcting voter rolls and from remov-
ing people who passed away. You can’t 
go in when someone’s dead and say, 
you know, dead people shouldn’t be 
voting. No, this bill mandates: Leave 
the dead people on the rolls—another 
step designed to invite fraud. 
Moreover, the ‘‘Corrupt Politicians 
Act’’ is welfare for politicians. This bill 
is designed to give hundreds of millions 
of dollars every year to corrupt incum-
bent politicians to keep them in power. 
It matches, for contributions under 
$200, 6 to 1 Federal funds so that the 
Members of this body would receive, 
collectively, over a billion dollars in 
Federal funds to stay in power. That is 
great if you are a corrupt politician 
who wants to prevent a challenger 
from ever defeating you. And if you 
want to prevent the voters from mak-
ing a different choice, then you flood

them with Federal funds to make it so 
you can’t beat corrupt incumbents, but 
that is not what you do if you want to 
protect the right to vote. 
This bill is brazen. It is so brazen 
that the joke really is admitted in one 
provision of the bill. The Federal Elec-
tion Commission was created in the 
wake of Watergate, designed to protect 
integrity in our elections. It was, from 
the beginning, designed to be bipar-
tisan—three Republicans, three Demo-
crats—because 
Congress 
recognized 
that a partisan Federal Election Com-
mission would be deeply injurious to 
our democracy, that to have a Federal 
Election Commission with any integ-
rity, it needed to be bipartisan, which 
means you needed a bipartisan major-
ity to act in order to ensure that nei-
ther party weaponizes the Federal elec-
tion laws. 
What does the ‘‘Corrupt Politicians 
Act’’ do? It turns the Federal Election 
Commission into a partisan body, 
shifts it from three Republicans and 
three Democrats to three Democrats 
and two Republicans. It turns it into 
an arm of the Democratic Senate Com-
mittee, in effect. Nothing in this bill is 
as cynical as that provision. We are in 
a 50–50 Senate. We have close elections 
in this race. 
The Presiding Officer is a sophisti-
cated political player. I want you to 
ask for a second, in a close election, in 
the weeks before the election, if the 
Senate majority leader had the ability 
to launch investigations from the Fed-
eral Election Commission, to bring 
prosecutions from the Federal Election 
Commission to sue the political oppo-
nents of the majority, how much would 
that invite abuse? 
I understand right now Democrats 
are in power of both Houses of Congress 
and the White House. Power can be in-
toxicating. But I do want to point out 
it wasn’t that long ago that the Pre-
siding Officer and I were both in this 
body—4 years ago—when there was a 
Republican President and a Republican 
House and a Republican Senate. You 
didn’t see the Republican majority try 
anything as brazen as the ‘‘Corrupt 
Politicians Act.’’ You didn’t see a Re-
publican majority trying to rig the 
game, trying to change the rules so 
that Republicans could never be de-
feated in the next election. You didn’t 
see the Republican majority trying to 
turn the Federal Election Commission 
into a partisan weapon. 
I ask you, what level of comfort 
would you have as an elected Democrat 
if MITCH MCCONNELL had control of the 
Federal Election Commission, if it 
were Republican partisan agents? I 
think you would be entirely justified in 
being concerned that it would be used 
as a political weapon to hurt you. Your 
last election was a relatively close 
election. Imagine 2 weeks before the 
election if a Republican Federal Elec-
tion Commission had mounted a sweep-
ing investigation in the massive cam-
paign finance violations by the incum-
bent Senator who happened to be of the 
party that was out of power. You would 
rightly feel that it was grotesquely un-
fair; yet that is what every Senate 
Democrat just voted to create. 
You know, the most pernicious as-
pect of this bill has been the racial 
demagoguery that it has invited. We 
have heard the Senate majority leader 
invoke, in booming terms, specters 
from our sorry history of racial dis-
crimination in the past. The Senate 
majority leader has used the phrase 
‘‘Jim Crow 2.0’’ repeatedly—as has the 
President of the United States, as has 
the Vice President of the United 
States—deliberately inflaming racial 
tensions, suggesting that laws, com-
monsense 
voter 
integrity 
laws 
in 
States like Georgia and Texas, things 
like requiring voter ID or requiring sig-
nature verification on absentee ballots, 
are somehow a modern manifestation 
of Jim Crow. That is a grotesque lie. 
The majority leader knows that. The 
President of the United States knows 
that. The Vice President of the United 
States knows—they know they are 
lying. But, ironically, they inadvert-
ently said something that is accurate 
about this piece of legislation. Jim 
Crow legislation was grotesque and 
ugly. It was legislation that was draft-
ed, without exception, by Democratic 
politicians. Jim Crow was written by 
Democratic politicians, and its pur-
pose, when the Jim Crow laws were 
written, were to prevent the voters 
from ever voting out of office Demo-
cratic politicians. It is one of the 
ugliest chapters of our Nation’s his-
tory. And thankfully, we repudiated 
Jim Crow. 
Well, the majority leader used the 
phrase ‘‘Jim Crow 2.0,’’ and inadvert-
ently, he is right, but not about what 
he is describing. He is right about the 
‘‘Corrupt Politicians Act.’’ The ‘‘Cor-
rupt Politicians Act’’ follows the exact 
same pattern that Jim Crow did. It is 
partisan legislation, written by elected 
Democrats, designed to keep elected 
Democrats in office and to steal the 
right to vote from the citizenry to de-
cide on somebody else. Democracy is 
too important for that. 
And the kind of cynical racial dema-
goguery that we have seen around this 
bill, while ignoring the substance of 
it—and I will point out the media has 
been eager to ignore the substance of 
it. The media says: Should we protect 
the right to vote? Yes, we should pro-
tect the right to vote. 
This bill takes away your right to 
vote. This bill is designed to prevent 
the voters from choosing to throw the 
bums out—the most fundamental right 
of any voter to throw the bums out, 
whether they are one side or the other 
side. We the people have sovereignty, 
and this bill, the ‘‘Corrupt Politicians 
Act’’ was designed to take that power 
from the people and give it to the poli-
ticians in Washington. 
So today was a victory. It was a vic-
tory for the American people. It was a 
victory for democracy. It was a victory 
for the Constitution. And it was a vic-
tory for the rule of law. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HAS-
SAN). The Senator from New York. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today for the 13th time to 
call for every Senator to have the op-
portunity to vote on a commonsense, 
bipartisan bill, the Military Justice 
Improvement and Increasing Preven-
tion Act. 
This bill would ensure that members 
of our military would get the justice 
and the justice system that their sac-
rifices deserve. We do not have time to 
delay. I began calling for a floor vote 
on this bill on May 24. That is 29 days 
ago. Since then, it is estimated that 
1,624 servicemembers will have been 
raped or sexually assaulted. More will 
have been victims of other serious 
crimes. 
Many of them will feel that there is 
no point in even reporting the crime 
because they have no faith in the cur-
rent military justice system. That is 
because right now, if a servicemember 
reports a crime, the case and their fate 
will be put into a commander’s hands. 
This bill argues, instead, that our 
servicemembers who are victims of se-
rious crimes or who are accused of seri-
ous crimes should have those cases re-
viewed by an impartial, trained, mili-
tary prosecutor. It does not say that 
commanders are removed from their 
responsibility with regard to the mili-
tary justice system. It doesn’t say that 
commanders are relieved of their re-
sponsibility of ensuring good order and 
discipline. Under this bill, commanders 
will still have the full array of tools to 
implement good order and discipline— 
counseling, restriction, confinement, 
protective orders, rank reduction, non-
judicial punishment, summary court- 
martial, and even special court-mar-
tial. None of these change under the 
law. 
In addition, under today’s system, 
only 3 percent of commanders have the 
right to do convening authority for 
general court-martial. So the truth is, 
it is a small number of commanders 
who will be even affected by this legis-
lation. But I can promise you, the view 
from the servicemembers will be sig-
nificant because they will now see that 
if they are someone who has been as-
saulted or harassed or had any justice 
need, that the person reviewing the 
case would be highly trained and unbi-
ased. And if you are a Black or Brown 
servicemember who is disproportion-
ately punished under the current sys-
tem, you would know that the decision 
maker was impartial, unbiased, and 
highly trained. This change is some-
thing that will help both victims of 
sexual assault and also defendants’ 
rights. 
For serious crimes, we need both 
pieces of this puzzle, and this bill pro-
vides both. It will still allow com-
manders to take the administrative 
steps to send a message to their troops 
about what is or is not tolerated, and 
97 percent of them have to do that

every day without having convening 
authority for general court-martial. It 
will allow for victims and their fami-
lies to get real justice. 
The Military Justice Improvement 
and Increasing Prevention Act will de-
liver the results that our servicemem-
bers and their families deserve without 
compromising 
command 
authority. 
That is what our allies have said. The 
UK, Germany, Israel, Australia, the 
Netherlands, and Canada have all testi-
fied to our body in various hearings 
and various committees that they saw 
no diminution in command control and 
no diminution in the ability to prepare 
and train troops. 
The truth is that this is a reform 
whose 
time 
has 
come, 
and 
every 
minute we delay, we are not standing 
by our servicemembers. It is a change 
that has been supported by veterans 
groups across the country. Whether it 
is the Iraq and Afghanistan association 
of veterans, whether it is the Vietnam 
veterans association, whether it is the 
Foreign Legion or the Veterans of For-
eign Wars, military veterans support 
this bill. 
This is a change whose time has 
come, and I request that we have a 
floor vote to decide this. 
Sixty-six Senators on a bipartisan 
basis support this. The committee has 
been addressing this issue for 8 years. 
We have already passed 250 smaller re-
forms, none of which has had a dent on 
the problem. It is time to do the reform 
that survivors have asked for and that 
veterans organizations support. 
I ask unanimous consent that at a 
time to be determined by the majority 
leader in consultation with the Repub-
lican leader, the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 1520 and the 
Senate proceed to its consideration; 
that there be 2 hours for debate equally 
divided in the usual form; and that 
upon the use or yielding back of that 
time, the Senate vote on the bill with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I would 
like to thank my colleague from New 
York for her work to move this issue 
forward. But once again, I would object 
to the request for the reasons I have 
previously stated. 
In addition, today the ranking mem-
ber of the committee, Senator INHOFE, 
released the written views of each 
member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
which he had requested on Senator 
GILLIBRAND’s proposed legislation. 
I understand that some in our body 
might discount these views of senior 
military leadership, and that is their 
prerogative. But I do believe it is im-
portant that their voices be part of the 
public discourse. They have dedicated 
their lives to the service of this Nation. 
They have led troops in combat. They 
have experienced all of the issues that 
face commanders and face subordi-
nates. They have a unique, I think, po-
sition within the system. In addition, 
the military will have to implement 
whatever system Congress devises, and 
it will require their expertise and skill. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
a letter from the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff to Senator INHOFE. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS 
OF STAFF, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. JAMES M. INHOFE, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR INHOFE: Thank you for your 
continued support and sincere interest in as-
sessing the impact of proposed legislation on 
the Armed Forces. As I understand the scope 
of the ‘‘Military Justice Improvement and 
Increasing Prevention Act of 2021,’’ the draft 
bill would remove the commander from deci-
sions for all non-military offenses and felony 
cases punishable by one year or more, in-
cluding the following: prohibited activities 
with military recruits or trainees by a per-
son in position of special trust: wrongful 
broadcast or distribution of intimate visual 
images: murder; manslaughter: death or in-
jury of an unborn child; child endangerment; 
rape and sexual assault; mails: deposit of ob-
scene matter; rape and sexual assault of a 
child; other sexual misconduct; larceny and 
wrongful appropriation; fraudulent use or 
credit cards, debit cards, and other access de-
vices; false pretenses to obtain services; rob-
bery; frauds against the United States; brib-
ery; graft; kidnapping; arson, burning prop-
erly with intent to defraud; extortion; aggra-
vated assault; assault with intent to commit 
murder, voluntary manslaughter, rape, sex-
ual assault, rape of a child, sexual assault of 
a child, robbery, arson, burglary, or kidnap-
ping; maiming; domestic violence; stalking; 
perjury; subordination of perjury; obstruct-
ing justice; misprision or serious offense; 
wrongful refusal to testify; prevention or au-
thorized seizure of property; noncompliance 
with procedural rules; wrongful interference 
with adverse administrative proceeding; and 
retaliation, 
The Uniform Code of Military Justice ex-
ists to provide justice and to maintain good 
order and discipline, both of which directly 
contribute to unit cohesion and U.S. mili-
tary effectiveness in combat. The military is 
unique in that commanders must maintain 
good order and discipline in order to success-
fully perform on the battlefield under the 
most intense of circumstances. Commanders’ 
orders must have the force or law, and all 
within his or her unit must acknowledge this 
authority. With this responsibility to en-
force the rule of law comes accountability. 
It is my professional opinion that remov-
ing commanders from prosecution decisions, 
process, and accountability may have an ad-
verse effect on readiness, mission accom-
plishment, good order and discipline, justice, 
unit cohesion, trust, and loyalty between 
commanders and those they lead. However, 
in the specific and limited circumstance of 
sexual assault, I remain open-minded to all 
solutions. This is a complex and difficult 
issue. I urge caution to ensure any changes 
to commander authority to enforce dis-
cipline be rigorously analyzed, evidence- 
based, and narrow in scope, limited only to 
sexual assault and related offenses. 
As I am sure you are aware, the Secretary 
of Defense established the Independent Re-
view Commission on Sexual Assault in the 
Military on February 26, 2021, chartered to 
address the multiple aspects and factors of 
this issue. It is my belief we have not made 
sufficient progress in recent years to elimi-
nate sexual assault, and we have con-
sequently lost the trust and confidence of 
many Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, 
and Guardians in the chain of command’s 
ability to adjudicate these serious crimes. I 
intend to reserve judgement until I have an 
opportunity to review the final recommenda-
tions of the Independent Review Commission 
to determine the merits of any such rec-
ommendations vis-a-vis proposed legislation 
currently in the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives. 
I remain committed to providing you my 
candid personal views and will do so after I 
have reviewed the recommendations of the 
Commission. I look forward to providing you 
my personal assessment on this matter in 
the near future. 
Sincerely, 
MARK A. MILLEY, 
General, U.S. Army. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I won’t 
quote from this letter at length now, 
but I would just point out that the 
Chiefs are open-minded about changing 
the way we prosecute sexual assault 
and harassment within the ranks. So 
am I. In fact, I think that is something 
that I hope becomes clear in our 
progress legislatively moving forward. 
But they nevertheless stress the impor-
tance of ensuring that any change Con-
gress enacts must be carefully tailored 
to address the problems we are trying 
to solve, and the critical problem we 
are trying to solve is sexual assault, 
sexual harassment, any kind of crime 
dealing with sexual misconduct. 
In addition, adequate time and re-
sources must be afforded for imple-
menting any of the changes that we 
propose. The nature and the magnitude 
of change we are contemplating here is 
complex; we have to make sure we do 
this right. 
Further, we have heard over the past 
few years from the leadership of the 
military service Judge Advocate Gen-
erals’ Corps, who have uniformly op-
posed these changes in nature and 
scope. These are the military lawyers, 
the very military justice experts to 
whom this bill would invest authority 
currently reserved to commanders. I 
believe we should listen to them as 
well and move prudently and delib-
erately to address the problem at hand. 
So, as I have said a number of times 
already, I intend to include the admin-
istration’s recommendations that de-
rive from the President’s Independent 
Review Commission in the markup of 
the Defense bill, subject to amend-
ment, not to move the bill on the floor 
without the chance for my colleagues 
in the committee to have their voices 
heard. These ladies and gentlemen have 
dedicated themselves to military pol-
icy for many years. They are experts in 
different dimensions of this issue, and 
they will add significantly to the de-
bate. 
To simply take a bill and send to it 
the floor without amendments I think 
is not the way to proceed. I anticipate 
a 
bill 
that 
will 
be 
strengthened 
through debate and discussion and de-
liberation by the committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4690 
June 22, 2021 
With that, I would reiterate my ob-
jection to Senator GILLIBRAND’s re-
quest. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I disagree with the chairman be-
cause the service chiefs and com-
manders for the last 8 years have ob-
jected to any serious reform. In fact, 
they have said time and again ‘‘Trust 
us. Trust us. We will get this right’’ 
and have objected to any major reform. 
In fact, that is what they did any-
time we tried to reform the military— 
they objected on the same basis, using 
the same words, when we tried to re-
peal don’t ask, don’t tell. They ob-
jected in the same way when we tried 
to allow women to get credit for being 
in combat. They objected in the same 
way when we integrated the military. 
So to hear these objections over and 
over again after the committee has 
studied this issue for 8 years and al-
lowed 250 reforms to be put into the 
NDAA—all of which were OK by the 
DOD—just flies in the face of reality. 
The military has demanded sole re-
sponsibility of these cases for the 8 
years that I have worked on this issue, 
and have they dented the problem? No. 
Sexual assaults were estimated at 
20,000 by the military last they count-
ed. Has the rate of cases going to trial 
increased? No. Has the rate of cases 
that have ended in conviction in-
creased? No. So under no measurable 
has the DOD got a handle on this. 
For the chairman to say it has to go 
through the committee, this issue has 
been going through the committee for 8 
years. In fact, when I passed bipartisan 
reform with people like Senator JONI 
ERNST on the safe to report language, 
it was taken out in conference by the 
same DOD staff who didn’t want it in 
there in the first place. 
So under the chairman’s view, this 
bill could certainly go through com-
mittee. We have more than half of the 
members. But I promise you, it will be 
watered down or taken out in con-
ference because the chairman and the 
ranking member are against it, and 
they have the authority to do so. So he 
is not offering a fair process. 
The fact that this bill has 66 cospon-
sors—how many bills in America, in 
this body, have the support of TED 
CRUZ
and 
LIZ
WARREN, 
of 
MITCH 
MCCONNELL
and 
Senator 
SCHUMER? 
None. This is the kind of bipartisan bill 
that this country is yearning for, the 
kind of commonsense reform that can 
protect servicemembers. 
While the chairman is so interested 
in supporting what the generals and 
the admirals and the top commanders 
want, why does he not listen to the 
servicemembers 
themselves, 
to 
the 
people who have suffered sexual as-
sault, to the people who have suffered 
racial bias in prosecution? Those are 
the people he should be listening to, 
not the top brass. 
We have deferred to them the entire 
10 years I have been on this committee, 
and in the entire 10 years, our com-
mittee has failed. It is time to bring 
this bill to the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, just a short time ago on this Sen-
ate floor, we witnessed a low point for 
this body. We witnessed every Repub-
lican Senator voting against moving 
forward 
to 
consider 
legislation 
to 
strengthen our democracy. We wit-
nessed all 50 Republican Senators vot-
ing to block consideration of the For 
the People Act. 
I don’t know why people are afraid of 
debating this issue, which is so funda-
mental to our country at this par-
ticular point in time. This bill, the For 
the People Act, has many important 
provisions. One of them, of course, is to 
establish minimum national standards, 
to make sure that every eligible Amer-
ican voter can access the ballot box. 
That should be something we all want. 
We should want every American eligi-
ble to vote to be out there exercising 
his or her right to vote, to participate 
in the decision making in our democ-
racy. And yet not a single Republican 
Senator voted to proceed with that de-
bate, even though this bill is more im-
portant now than ever before because 
we see, as we speak, Republican State 
legislatures, in so many places around 
our country, voting to erect barriers to 
the ballot box. 
We see this in State after State, a 
pure partisan power play to rig the 
rules, to win elections by subtraction— 
not to win elections through the hurly- 
burly debate over the issues of the day, 
not to win elections by talking about 
the agenda that somebody is advo-
cating and why someone should vote 
for a particular candidate. That is the 
way it is supposed to be. But these are 
legislatures that are putting up bar-
riers to make it harder for people to 
access the ballot and specifically de-
signing these barriers to try to limit 
participation by people of color and by 
younger voters. 
We saw that even before the after-
math of this election. We saw it in the 
aftermath of the Supreme Court deci-
sion in Shelby v. Holder. We saw Texas 
and North Carolina and other States 
adopting these kind of restrictive vot-
ing laws. You don’t have to take my 
word for it; the U.S. courts took a look 
at the North Carolina law that was 
passed a number of years ago and said 
that they targeted African-American 
voters with ‘‘surgical precision’’ to try 
to keep them from accessing the voting 
booth, and that is exactly the kind of 
thing that is going on now in State 
after State around the country: trying 
to win, not by the addition and mul-
tiplication of democracy, but by sub-
traction and by division. 
And so why are these States doing 
this at this moment? They are doing it 
because of the Big Lie that was per-
petrated in the aftermath of our Presi-
dential election, a lie that the former 
President persists in spewing and re-
peating to this very moment, the lie 
that he was somehow cheated or robbed 
out of an election that led to the at-
tack on this Capitol on January 6. 
It is that lie that is giving rise to 
these actions in State legislatures. It is 
that lie that sadly led this body just a 
short while ago to block consideration 
of a bill to establish a commission to 
look at what happened on January 6. 
That bill, too, was filibustered just like 
this one, in order to prevent the Amer-
ican people from getting to the bottom 
of the Big Lie. Republican Senators 
blocked that, too. They don’t want the 
country to know, and they are per-
fectly happy to allow all these State 
legislatures to put up barriers to vot-
ing as part of that Big Lie narrative. 
And we know it is a big lie for so 
many reasons. Of course, President 
Trump and his campaign took their 
claims to courts throughout the coun-
try. Over 60 courts said those were ri-
diculous claims. President Trump’s 
own Justice Department and his Attor-
ney General, former Attorney General 
Barr, before he stepped down, said 
there was no wrongdoing in this elec-
tion that would change any kind of 
outcome. 
The President’s point person at the 
Department of Homeland Security, re-
sponsible for monitoring the integrity 
of elections, has testified before Con-
gress and said very clearly that the 
2020 Presidential election was the most 
secure election in American history— 
most secure in American history. That 
is from the person in charge of election 
integrity in President Trump’s own ad-
ministration. 
So why are all these States enacting 
these barriers to voting after an elec-
tion that the Trump Homeland Secu-
rity Department said was the most se-
cure in history? It is because so many 
people turned out and voted in that se-
cure election and they didn’t like the 
outcome. 
So when you don’t like the outcome 
in elections, instead of taking your 
case to the American people and say-
ing, Vote for us next time because here 
is our agenda for the country, here is 
what we are going to do—instead, they 
decided they are going to try to win by 
putting up barriers to try to prevent 
those large turnouts, especially from 
people of color, and we saw younger 
voters come out in 2020. 
So the decision to block this bill 
from debate is just a continuation of 
protecting the Big Lie. It is a continu-
ation of protecting the Big Lie that is 
being fueled around the country by 
Donald Trump’s continuous fraudulent 
claims, 
which 
unfortunately 
have 
seized the Republican Party.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

June 22, 2021 
We saw what happened in the House 
of Representatives. LIZ CHENEY, a stal-
wart conservative, ousted from her 
leadership position because she didn’t 
pay homage to the former President. 
That is what is going on here. That is 
what is going on in the House, and that 
is what is reflected in this vote today, 
the refusal to even debate a bill to 
strengthen our democracy. Come to the 
floor, tell us what you don’t like, tell 
us what you want to do. Do you really 
believe that what these State legisla-
tures are doing is a good thing for our 
democracy? 
I know it is easier not to have to talk 
about that, easier to ignore that, but 
we are not going to let this issue go 
away. We are going to be here week 
after week to make sure that we con-
tinue to push this For the People Act. 
Now, in addition to the provisions to 
establish minimal protections so every 
eligible voter can access the voting 
booth, the For the People Act also has 
a number of very important provisions 
that are overwhelmingly popular with 
the American people. One of them is 
the incorporation of what is known as 
the DISCLOSE Act. 
The DISCLOSE Act does a very sim-
ple thing: It gets rid of secret corporate 
money being plowed into our elections 
through these secret super PACs. You 
know what happened after the decision 
in Citizens United were two things. 
One, corporate money could flow in un-
limited amounts into elections, but the 
Supreme Court at the time said: You 
can at least be aware of who is spend-
ing this money if you pass laws to 
make sure it is transparent. 
In fact, a lot of the Justices who 
voted to overturn the Citizens United— 
excuse me, voted to allow corporate 
money in politics, who were the major-
ity in Citizens United, have also said in 
that same opinion that they essen-
tially expected Congress to enact laws 
to ensure transparency. 
In fact, eight of the nine Supreme 
Court Justices in that case took that 
position. Yet the Republican leader, 
who in the early 2000s called for more 
transparency when it came to money 
being spent in elections, is taking the 
opposite idea: We don’t want the public 
to know who is spending all that 
money. We want it to be secret. 
I think most of us would agree and I 
know the American public agrees that 
they have a right to know who is 
spending millions and millions of dol-
lars to try to influence their votes. We 
know that because survey after survey 
shows that Republicans, Democrats, 
and Independents all agree that they 
should know who is spending all of this 
dark money. 
When you see a TV commercial that 
says, ‘‘Paid for by the Committee for 
America,’’ you should know who is fi-
nancing that ad to try to influence 
your vote. It is a very simple principle. 
Voters have a right to know. It was a 
principle agreed to by conservative ju-
rists like Justice Scalia. And yet the 
position of the Republican Senators 
today was: We don’t even want to talk 
about that. We don’t even want to de-
bate that provision. 
By the way, that provision, the DIS-
CLOSE Act, passed the House back in 
2010, and it came here to the U.S. Sen-
ate, and the Senate version of the DIS-
CLOSE Act was debated on this Senate 
floor, and 59 Senators at that time 
voted to proceed with the bill. 
You might say: 59 Senators, that is 
the majority; why didn’t it pass? Be-
cause of the filibuster rule. They need-
ed 60. And 59 Senators said: We want 
disclosure. And 59 Senators said: Get 
rid of secret money. But because of the 
filibuster 
rule, 
it 
didn’t 
pass. 
It 
couldn’t get to final passage on a sim-
ple majority. 
If that had passed back in 2010, we 
wouldn’t have our airwaves flooded 
with secret money today. We would 
have done what the American people 
wanted. The DISCLOSE Act is in this 
bill now, and once again, 11 years later, 
Republican Senators are filibustering 
the bill for the DISCLOSE Act. 
They don’t want the American people 
to know who is spending all of that 
money, mostly corporate money, flow-
ing underground under the radar screen 
through our political system to try to 
elect candidates of the choice of what-
ever special interests are spending that 
money. They don’t want you to know 
who they are, who is spending all that 
money to elect people. So why don’t we 
all agree we are going to get rid of se-
cret money? Apparently, we don’t even 
want to debate that. 
Another provision that is universally 
popular with the American people is 
the idea that we should have nation-
wide nonpartisan congressional dis-
tricting. Let’s draw congressional dis-
tricts not based on politics but based 
on some nonpartisan criteria. 
I think we all heard the line that it 
should not be the case that politicians 
are picking the voters. Voters should 
pick their elected officials. These days, 
people can draw congressional district 
maps with incredible precision with the 
use of computers. You can literally try 
and draw a congressional district de-
signed to get exactly the electorate 
they want. 
I don’t think that is the way the 
Founders expected it to end up work-
ing, to get a computer that could draw 
these districts with that kind of preci-
sion and accuracy. And so one of the 
other important provisions in the For 
the People Act is, Let’s draw congres-
sional districts so that, we, the people, 
can make these decisions without the 
lines having been drawn to predeter-
mine the outcome. That is also in this 
bill. 
It also has some other important pro-
visions that I support to try to reduce 
the impact and influence of big money 
contributors to allow people with less-
er means to be able to contribute to 
elections and have some element of 
public financing so that the system is 
more geared toward the public interest 
than relying exclusively on the private 
big contributions. That is another pro-
vision that is in the For the People 
Act. 
Some people may disagree with that. 
Come to the floor, debate it, offer an 
amendment to get rid of it, let’s vote. 
But what we saw today was a refusal to 
engage in the democratic process of de-
bate in consideration of a bill. They 
used this provision, the filibuster pro-
vision, to block a bill to help protect 
and strengthen our democracy, and 
that is a sad and shameful day in the 
U.S. Senate. 
But I am going to end with this. This 
issue is not going away. I was glad to 
see that even as every Republican Sen-
ator voted no, every Democratic Sen-
ator united together to say, We stand 
for the idea that we should have some 
minimal national standards for access 
to the ballot booth to protect our de-
mocracy and that we should get rid of 
secret money in politics. 
Every Democrat said, Let’s proceed 
to debate a bill that has those impor-
tant provisions in it. And so we are not 
going away. This is a vote that may be 
a temporary setback, but it is my 
strong view that, at the end of the day, 
democracy will prevail in the sense 
that it will be strengthened and that 
the American people are not going to 
stand for a process that reinforces the 
Big Lie that was perpetrated on this 
country. 
And so the good news—the good 
news, as I said, is every Democratic 
Senator said yes to moving forward, 
and we will find a way to get this done. 
We will find a way to protect our de-
mocracy. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF KENNETH ALLEN 
POLITE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
intend to object to any unanimous con-
sent request relating to the nomina-
tion of Kenneth Allen Polite to be an 
Assistant Attorney General at the De-
partment of Justice, PN423. 
Last week, at the Senate Judiciary 
Committee’s Executive Business Meet-
ing, I noted my intent to object to Mr. 
Polite’s confirmation not on the basis 
of his credentials—I happen to find him 
well qualified for the position—but on 
the basis of the Justice Department’s 
failure to respond to congressional 
oversight requests. 
To date, the Justice Department has 
failed to provide a full and complete re-
sponse to any of my oversight requests. 
As one of many examples, on Feb-
ruary 3, 2021, and March 9, 2021, Sen-
ator JOHNSON and I requested informa-
tion from the Justice Department re-
lating 
to 
Nicholas 
McQuaid. 
Mr. 
McQuaid is Acting Assistant Attorney 
General for the Criminal Division, the 
position Mr. Polite will hold upon con-
firmation. In those letters, we raised 
concerns about potential conflicts of 
interest in light of the fact that Mr. 
McQuaid was employed at Latham & 
Watkins until January 20, 2021, and 
worked with Christopher Clark, whom 
Hunter Biden reportedly hired to work 
on his Federal criminal case. 
This arrangement presents a poten-
tial conflict of interest. A core func-
tion of congressional oversight is to en-
sure that governmental Departments 
and Agencies are free of conflicts of in-
terest. That is especially so with the 
Justice Department and FBI. If con-
flicts infect them, those investigations 
and prosecutions—the very purpose of 
the Department’s existence—could be 
undermined. 
As a part of my oversight, I have re-
quested 
a 
recusal 
memo 
for 
Mr. 
McQuaid. I have also requested to 
know, as a threshold issue, whether 
one even exists. 
Attorney General Garland has failed 
to answer and provide the requested 
records. I have noted to the Depart-
ment that in 2016 I received from the 
Department Andrew McCabe’s recusal 
memo to illustrate precedent exists for 
such a production to Congress. Still, 
the Justice Department refuses to pro-
vide the same for Mr. McQuaid. 
There is nothing more eroding of 
public faith than an unresponsive exec-
utive branch that believes it only an-
swers to the President and not the U.S. 
Congress and, perhaps most impor-
tantly, ‘‘we the people.’’ 
This administration’s continued on-
going and blatant lack of cooperation 
has forced my hand. Thus, unfortu-
nately, I must object to any consider-
ation of this nomination. My objection 
is not intended to question the creden-
tials of Mr. Polite in any way. The ex-
ecutive branch must recognize that it 
has an ongoing obligation to respond to 
congressional inquiries in a timely and 
reasonable manner.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BAPTIST HEALTH 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize Baptist Health 
of Arkansas’s centennial—a significant 
and commendable milestone. 
Today, Arkansans are gathering to 
celebrate this institution and its staff 
that have been dedicated to providing 
exceptional faith-based healthcare to 
its patients, strengthening commu-
nities through compassionate service, 
and continuously responding to the 
ever-changing health needs of Arkan-
sans. 
On February 16, 1921, the Arkansas 
Baptist State Convention incorporated 
Baptist State Hospital to ensure Ar-
kansans had access to quality, faith-

based healthcare. Baptist Health start-
ed with a mere 70 beds and in just 1 
year more than tripled that number, 
administering care to more than 300 
patients. The hospital’s humble begin-
nings show the diligence of the men 
and women who, through intense devo-
tion, made this organization what it is 
today. 
The dedication of Baptist Health’s 
providers is a testament to this healing 
ministry’s service and commitment to 
its patients. For 100 years patients 
from across the State, Nation and 
world have relied on the hospital’s in-
credible doctors, nurses and staff to 
perform lifesaving treatments and sur-
geries. 
This institution has served the State 
of Arkansas in numerous ways, from 
creating thousands of jobs to sup-
porting the State economy and saving 
the lives of countless patients. Baptist 
Health has created reliable medical 
service across the State and helped 
many medical professionals in their 
educations and careers. 
Baptist Health has been a leader in 
medical advancement in Arkansas, and 
its community of medical professionals 
have made tremendous sacrifices to 
serve and care for patients. Their dedi-
cation has been apparent during the 
COVID–19 public health crisis. This de-
votion to its mission has made Baptist 
Health Arkansas’s largest and most 
comprehensive 
not-for 
profit 
healthcare organization. From the doc-
tors and nurses to the office workers 
and maintenance staff, each member of 
the team demonstrates a passion for 
helping and healing. 
Congratulations to Baptist Health on 
100 years of service and dedication to 
helping 
Arkansans 
live 
long 
and 
healthy lives. I look forward to its con-
tinued excellence in healthcare for our 
State for many more years.∑

REMEMBERING EMMANUEL 
LARRYN SLACK 
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, 
Emmanuel Larryn Slack, age 17, en-
tered into eternal rest on Friday, June 
4, 2021, at Oschner LSU Hospital in 
Shreveport, LA. Emmanuel was born 
on January 18, 2004, to Melvin G. Slack, 
Jr., and Bridgette L. Wililams in 
Shreveport, LA. While attending Union 
Spring Baptist Church under the lead-
ership of Pastor Roosevelt Seaberry, he 
was an active member of the youth 
choir and the drill team. Upon chang-
ing residences, he later accepted the 
Lord Jesus Christ as his Savior under 
the leadership of Pastor Joey Ketchum 
at the Western Hills Baptist Church. 
He was a faithful and active member in 
the ministry. Gifted with reaching 
young people, he became active with 
Bible studies, Vacation Bible School, 
and Youth Group activities under both 
leaders. 
Emmanuel 
attended 
Hun-
tington High School, where he was a 
member of the Yearbook club and par-
ticipated in JROTC. When thinking of 
career choices, he was originally cer-
tain he wanted to be a police officer or 
an FBI agent, but it was after he took 
an interest in politics and the Repub-
lican Party that he began to thrive. He 
became active with the Texas Young 
Republicans and Republican Women of 
Bossier, where he expressed his beliefs 
in American individualism, rule of law, 
the Constitution, and the Holy Bible, 
which guided him to greatness and con-
tinual 
self-improvement. 
Emmanuel 
expressed his views across Louisiana 
and Texas lines and considered himself 
to be bipartisan, a conservative Repub-
lican, a proud soon-to-be Texan, up-
holding traditional values like bravery, 
courage, leadership, and principle, and 
above all, a follower of Christ. Emman-
uel was actively working on an intern-
ship with Rhonda Anderson of Long-
view, TX. He was embraced by Gov-
ernor Greg Abbott’s office; Tarrant 
County Young Republicans of Fort 
Worth, TX; attorney general of Lou-
isiana Jeff Landry’s office; Caddo Par-
ish Commissioner Jim Taliaferro; Com-
missioner Mario Chavez of District 10; 
Congressman MIKE
JOHNSON
of the 
Fourth District of Louisiana; Lieuten-
ant 
Governor 
of 
Louisiana 
Billy 
Nungesser; Republican Women of Bos-
sier; and Ouachita Parish Republican 
Women. His hope was to become a Gov-
ernor, Senator, or President. 
Preceding Emmanuel in death were 
his maternal grandmother Marel D. 
Williams, grandfather Larry N. Wil-
liams, Sr., and paternal grandfather 
Melvin Slack, Sr., a veteran of the U.S. 
Marine Corps. He leaves to celebrate 
his life parents Bridgette L. Williams 
and Melvin G. Slack, Jr.; paternal 
grandmother 
Jackie 
Spivey 
Slack; 
brothers Triston M. Williams, Nehe-
miah C. Slack, and Melvin Slack III;

mine Slack; Godparents Tamra P. 
Thompson, Michael Pennywell; Pastor 
Handy Giles and First Lady Charlene 
Giles; 
aunt 
Yolanda 
Y. 
Williams- 
Brown; uncle Larry N. Williams, Jr.; 
special friends Mario Chavez, Jenna

Quinn, Parker Ward, and Whitney 
Scates; mentors, Christ Henry and

cles, aunts, and loving cousins.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE 
INTERNATIONAL FALLS JOURNAL 
∑ Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
today I rise to honor and pay tribute to 
the International Falls Journal, the 
local newspaper of the International 
Falls and Koochiching County commu-
nities that has provided timely, trust-
worthy, and thorough reporting to 
Minnesotans for the past 110 years. On 
June 24, 2021, the International Falls 
Journal will sadly publish its final edi-
tion. 
Founded in 1911 by Clarence Burton 
Montgomery as The Daily Journal, the 
then-daily paper has been a community 
staple since its start, informing locals 
of who was born and who died, local 
business news, and what happened at 
city council and school board meetings. 
Through different disasters and crises, 
The Journal made sure they delivered 
the news to their readers. In 1988, a fire 
ripped through its office on a Friday 
night, claiming most of the building 
and everything inside, including the 
paper’s equipment. Still, that Monday 
and for weeks following the fire while 
the outlet was without printers, the 
paper was published as planned. This 
was 38 years after the great flood of 
1950, when—you guessed it—the paper 
still ended up on their readers’ door-
steps despite the unprecedented cir-
cumstance. 
The paper went through several own-
ers before landing in the hands of Arlin 
Albrecht and Phil Duff, The Journal’s 
current publishers, who purchased the 
paper in 1974. 
Regardless of ownership, locals have 
always been able to count on The Jour-
nal. International Falls Area Chamber 
of Commerce President Tricia Heibel 
said it well: ‘‘From births, deaths, mar-
riages, school events and sporting high-
lights, from lost pets to everything 
else, it was just a really central com-
munication tool.’’ 
As the daughter of a newspaperman, I 
grew up knowing just how important 
local newspapers like the International 
Falls Journal are. In fact, it is thanks 
to the presence of a local newspaper— 
the Duluth Herald—in my dad’s child-
hood home that my grandmother spot-
ted his interest in storytelling when he 
was just 12. Local papers played an ir-
replaceable role in my father’s life, as 
they continue to today for countless 
readers. 
But today, newspapers of all sizes are 
struggling and closing. Ad revenue for 
U.S. newspapers plummeted from $49.4 
billion in 2005 to $14.3 billion in 2018. 
During that time, two other compa-
nies, Facebook and Google—worth over 
$2.4 trillion combined—became adver-
tising titans. These two companies 
don’t just control the majority of on-
line advertising; they have built power 
over the news and crushed local news 
outlets along the way. 
With the closure of The Journal, we 
are once again seeing the impacts of 
this firsthand. We can’t stand by and 
watch this happen to our independent 
press. That is why I have introduced bi-
partisan legislation to let news pub-
lishers join together to negotiate fair 
terms with these giant digital corpora-
tions. We must give independent papers 
the chance to compete. 
But even as we work to ensure other 
papers are able to keep their lights on, 
the International Falls Journal is a re-
minder of the value of local jour-
nalism. For more than a century, it 
has empowered its readers by providing 
them with accurate, relevant informa-
tion about their communities. It has 
captured moments big and small that 
together tell a beautiful story of the 
region that will live on. 
Even as it closes its doors, genera-
tions will benefit from the legacy it 
leaves behind.∑

RE-
SEARCH AND THE MISSION OF 
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF 
HEALTH, THE WORLD’S PREMIER 
BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AGENCY 
Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. 
BURR) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 281 
Whereas Congress chartered the Founda-
tion for the National Institutes of Health 
(referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘FNIH’’) 
to support the mission of the National Insti-
tutes of Health (referred to in this preamble 
as the ‘‘NIH’’), which is to advance research 
in pursuit of fundamental knowledge that 
will lead to better health outcomes for all; 
Whereas June 26, 2021, marks 25 years since 
FNIH commenced its work to improve health 
outcomes for the people of the United States 
by facilitating groundbreaking research and 
catalyzing innovation and discovery to an-
swer the toughest scientific questions; 
Whereas FNIH is recognized by Congress, 
NIH, and the biomedical community as a 
model for aligning public and private part-
ners around a common cause that advances 
breakthrough biomedical discoveries and im-
proves the quality of people’s lives; 
Whereas, among the hundreds of programs 
FNIH has facilitated, the Grand Challenges 
in Global Health partnership, founded in col-
laboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates 
Foundation, 
achieved 
scientific 
break-
throughs against deadly diseases in the 
world’s poorest countries and elevated the 
role of FNIH as a leader in building alliances 
for biomedical research; 
Whereas FNIH, NIH, and the Food and 
Drug Administration of the Department of 
Health and Human Services launched the Ac-
celerating Medicines Partnership as a public- 
private collaboration to pursue new methods 
to develop diagnostics and treatments for 
Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes, auto-
immune disorders, Parkinson’s disease, and 
schizophrenia; 
Whereas the FNIH created a new model for 
clinical trials through initiatives to fight 
breast cancer and lung cancer, continues to 
bring together partners to identify, develop, 
and qualify biomarkers to improve drug dis-
covery and regulatory decisionmaking, and 
recognizes and supports trailblazing re-
searchers, some of whom have won other 
prestigious scientific prizes, including the 
Nobel Prize; 
Whereas FNIH supports caregivers of NIH 
Clinical Center patients through the Edmond 
J. Safra Family Lodge, a temporary resi-
dence for caregivers whose close presence 
helps to sustain patients who volunteer for 
NIH research that was constructed and is 
maintained by the FNIH on the NIH campus; 
Whereas FNIH answered NIH’s call to ac-
tion to address the largest pandemic in a 
century by launching and coordinating the 
Accelerating COVID–19 Therapeutic Inter-
ventions and Vaccines (‘‘ACTIV’’) initiative 
in partnership with numerous government 
agencies, not-for-profit organizations, and 
biopharmaceutical companies to accelerate 
the most promising COVID–19 vaccines and 
treatments; and 
Whereas FNIH remains an indispensable 
institution to the biomedical research mis-
sion of the NIH and the people of the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) celebrates the 25th anniversary of the 
Foundation for the National Institutes of 
Health and its critical role in advancing bio-
medical research and the mission of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, the world’s pre-
mier biomedical research agency; 
(2) applauds the Foundation for the Na-
tional Institutes of Health for its leadership 
and ongoing efforts to advance human health 
outcomes through innovative public-private 
partnerships that achieve groundbreaking 
biomedical research results; 
(3) commends the Foundation for the Na-
tional Institutes of Health for its efforts to 
address the COVID–19 pandemic through the 
Accelerating COVID–19 Therapeutic Inter-
ventions and Vaccines initiative and accel-
erate the development of the most promising 
treatments and vaccines for COVID–19; and 
(4) reiterates that the Foundation for the 
National Institutes of Health, in partnership 
with the National Institutes of Health, is a 
vital and essential component of biomedical 
research strategy of the United States.

S4701 
June 22, 2021 
PADILLA, Mr. JOHNSON, Mr. PETERS, Mr. 
LANKFORD, Ms. SINEMA, Mr. BRAUN, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. PORTMAN, Mr. VAN HOL-
LEN, Mr. SCOTT of Florida, Mr. CARDIN, 
and Mr. ROMNEY) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 282 
Whereas the General Accounting Office, 
predecessor to the Government Account-
ability Office (referred to in this preamble as 
the ‘‘GAO’’), opened its doors on July 1, 1921, 
following the enactment of the Budget and 
Accounting Act, 1921 (Public Law 67–13; 42 
Stat. 20); 
Whereas the need, identified by Congress 
following World War I, for more information 
and better control of expenditures made by 
the Federal Government was filled by the 
creation of the independent GAO; 
Whereas Congress provided the GAO with a 
broad mandate— 
(1) to investigate how Federal dollars are 
spent; and 
(2) to review all Federal expenditures; 
Whereas, as the size and expenditures of 
the Federal Government grew during the 
Great Depression and World War II, the GAO 
became overwhelmed with fiscal audits, 
which pushed Congress to amend the author-
ity of the GAO to enable it to assist Federal 
agencies with improving their accounting 
and spending controls; 
Whereas Congress amended the authority 
of the GAO to expand its work beyond finan-
cial audits to performance audits to deter-
mine how Federal agencies and programs 
performed and met their objectives in the 
wake of the Great Society programs of the 
late 1960s; 
Whereas the GAO shifted its priorities in 
the late 1900s and early 2000s— 
(1) to highlight high risk areas for Federal 
Government waste and operation failures; 
and 
(2) to work to improve Federal financial 
management and budgeting; 
Whereas, as of the date of adoption of this 
resolution, the GAO is known around the 
world as a leader and source of objective, 
nonpartisan information on government op-
erations through its work examining cost, 
effectiveness, and other factors related to 
the success of Federal programs; 
Whereas, in addition to its field offices 
across the United States, the GAO operates 
field offices around the world to make it 
easier to access and monitor Federal Govern-
ment operations that extend across the 
globe; 
Whereas the GAO employs approximately 
3,200 people and has been recognized as being 
one of the top workplaces in the Federal 
Government for several years by its multi- 
disciplinary workforce, which includes ana-
lysts, auditors, lawyers, economists, sci-
entists, actuaries, law enforcement and secu-
rity personnel, healthcare experts, and edu-
cation, public policy, computer science, and 
cybersecurity personnel, among others; 
Whereas the GAO averaged a $165 return on 
every $1 invested in the GAO between fiscal 
years 2016 and 2020 as a result of Federal 
agencies 
and 
Congress 
acting 
on 
rec-
ommendations made by the GAO; 
Whereas the financial benefit to the Fed-
eral Government resulting from the work of 
the GAO totaled— 
(1) in fiscal year 2020, $77,600,000,000; and 
(2) in the past 20 years combined, over 
$1,200,000,000,000; and 
Whereas, in addition to serving as the pre-
eminent independent government watchdog 
agency in the world, the GAO provides addi-
tional services, which include— 
(1) writing legal opinions at the request of 
Congress or in response to a bid protest; 
(2) authoring resources and standards for 
auditors around the world; 
(3) operating a hotline for the public to re-
port waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement 
of government funds; and 
(4) providing testimony before Congress on 
a multitude of topics: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the 100th anniversary of the 
Government Accountability Office (referred 
to in this resolution as the ‘‘GAO’’) on July 
1, 2021; 
(2) commends the GAO for 100 years of 
service to Congress and the United States as 
the 
preeminent 
independent 
government 
watchdog agency in the world; 
(3) offers its continued support to allow the 
GAO— 
(A) to fulfill its mandates as required by 
law; 
(B) to respond to requests made by Mem-
bers of Congress; and 
(C) to aid the Federal Government in im-
proving its stewardship of taxpayer dollars; 
(4) recognizes Eugene Dodaro, the Comp-
troller General and head of the GAO as of the 
date of adoption of this resolution, and the 
dedicated and professional staff of the GAO 
who work diligently to produce fact-based 
reports, thoughtful recommendations, and 
sound legal decisions; and 
(5) will continue to partner with the GAO 
in the pursuit of its mission— 
(A) to support Congress in meeting its con-
stitutional responsibilities; and 
(B) to help improve the performance and 
accountability of the Federal Government 
for the benefit of the people of the United 
States. 
Ms. HASAN. Mr. President, it is my 
great honor. as Chair of the U.S. Sen-
ate Homeland Security and Govern-
mental 
Affairs 
Committees 
Sub-
committee on Emerging Threats and 
Spending Oversight to recognize July 1, 
2021, as the 100th anniversary of the es-
tablishment of the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO), and com-
mend it for its service to the people of 
the United States. I am grateful to 
Comptroller General Gene Dodaro and 
to GAO’s 3,200 employees who work 
hard to ensure that federal programs 
are well managed and fiscally respon-
sible. As we recognize the GAO, I also 
encourage my colleagues to continue 
to partner with the GAO as we work to-
gether to help improve the perform-
ance of the federal government for the 
benefit of the American people. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in adopting 
this resolution.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
GEORGE DALE BURT 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of George 
Dale Burt, a beloved husband, grandfather, 
and friend. He passed away peacefully at 
Baptist Memorial Hospital in Oxford on May 9, 
2021. I join his loved ones in mourning his 
loss. 
He was born on February 2, 1937 to Hattie 
Patterson Burt and George Lee Burt. He at-
tended Oakland High School and Delta State 
University. He later earned his master’s de-
gree from the University of Mississippi. Mr. 
Burt went on to become the principal of 
Senatobia High School. It was there he began 
his thirty year coaching career in football that 
allowed him to impact countless students. 
Dale was an outdoorsman and spent time 
on the family farm. For twenty-five summers, 
he served as a park ranger at Arkabutla Lake. 
Left to cherish his memory are his wife, Eliz-
abeth Hawkins Burt; children, Teri Lynn Burt 
Scoggins, David Allen Burt; Carol H. Darby, 
Patsy Williams; eight grandchildren and eight 
great-grandchildren. 
Mr. Burt was a dedicated mentor, loving 
husband, and diligent father. l thank him for 
his service to the state of Mississippi and offer 
my deepest condolences to his family and 
friends.

RECOGNIZING THE FOUNDING OF 
VFW POST 12205 IN BULVERDE, 
TEXAS 
HON. CHIP ROY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize the founding of VFW Post 12205 in 
Bulverde, Texas. I wanted to take a moment 
to congratulate Commander McKinnon and 
those who helped establish Texas’s 290th 
VFW Post. Over the past several years, the 
number of veterans in the Spring Branch and 
Bulverde area has grown tremendously and 
the need for a new VFW has become ever 
more apparent. As a member of the Veteran 
Affairs Committee, it is critically important to 
me that we have organizations like VFWs 
present locally to serve our veterans and com-
munities, but also to promote patriotism and 
the American ideals we desperately need 
more of today. I have no doubt that this VFW 
Post will be a source of camaraderie, service, 
and education. I hope my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives will join me in con-
gratulating these American patriots at VFW 
Post 12205 on their inaugural meeting and 
success in their future endeavors.

HONORING 
THE 
36 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE OF COUNCILMAN DAVID 
JORDAN 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the Hon-
orable City Councilman of Greenwood, Mis-
sissippi, Mr. David Jordan. 
Councilman Jordan served on the Green-
wood City Council for 36 years representing 
Ward 6. During his tenure, he helped uplift the 
community through his superb leadership. He 
will continue his endeavors by representing 
District 24 as a member of the Mississippi 
State Senate. Senator Jordan has served in 
the State Senate for the previous 28 years as-
suming office in 1993. 
Born on April 3, 1934, in Leflore County, 
Mississippi, David was the youngest of five 
children born to sharecropper parents. Grow-
ing up working in cotton fields, David always 
valued education. Through relentless effort, he 
received his high school diploma and went on 
to enroll in Mississippi Valley State University. 
Later, he attended the University of Wyoming. 
Due to his undying love for people, he 
began his career as a science teacher. With a 
yearning to serve his community, Mr. Jordan 
decided to run for City Councilman in 1985 
which he held until June 15, 2021. At the age 
of 88, he is married to the lovely Christine 
Bell-Jordan, and currently resides in Green-
wood, MS. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to acknowl-
edge Councilman Jordan for his honorable en-
deavors to Mississippi communities.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
CAPTAIN 
PAUL MCKEEVER’S DECADES OF 
SERVICE TO THE CITY OF DEAR-
BORN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Captain Paul McKeever on 
the occasion of his retirement from the Dear-
born Fire Department after over 25 years of 
service to the City of Dearborn, Michigan, His 
significant service to our community is worthy 
of commendation. 
Captain McKeever began his career in pub-
lic service as a United States Marine stationed 
at 29 Palms, California and later was stationed 
across the state of Michigan. After transferring 
to 
the 
Marine 
Corps 
Reserve, 
Captain 
McKeever became a member of the Dearborn 
Fire Department in August 1995. He continued 
to serve in both military and civilian firefighting 
capacities until 2017 when he retired from the 
Ohio Air National Guard with the rank of Mas-
ter Sergeant. 
Captain McKeever joined the Dearborn Fire 
Department in 1995 and was promoted to Fire 
Lieutenant in 2007. On June 5, 2012 he was 
promoted to the role of Captain. A committed 
leader always willing to go the extra mile for 
his team, he is a graduate of the Eastern 
Michigan University School of Fire Staff and 
Command. Over the course of his extensive 
career, Captain McKeever has been the recipi-
ent of countless awards for excellence in serv-
ice including the Fire Chief Life Saving Award, 
Fire Officer of the Year, multiple Meritorious 
Company Commendations, and a 2019 Certifi-
cate of Special Recognition, 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Captain Paul McKeever for his 
exemplary 25 years of service. He has effec-
tively and selflessly served the City of Dear-
born in his role as Chief of the Fire Depart-
ment and has been steadfastly dedicated to 
the safety of our community. I join with Cap-
tain McKeever’s family including his wife Meryl 
and children Paul, Ian, Liam, Grace, and 
Emma, friends, and colleagues in extending 
my best wishes to him in retirement.

MAXINE WHITFIELD PRYOR 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and accom-
plishments of Ms. Maxine Whitfield Pryor who 
will celebrate her 100th birthday on July 25, 
2021.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GENE 
HECKMAN 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mr. Gene Heckman of Colum-
bia City, Indiana. Gene was a beloved mem-
ber of his community whose work shaped the 
lives of generations who call northeast Indiana 
home. 
Gene entered the U.S. Air Force upon grad-
uating high school in 1957, marking the begin-
ning of a life of service. Upon being honorably 
discharged in 1963, Gene returned to civilian 
life. He married his sweetheart, Karen Rose, 
and together made the Tri-Lakes community 
their home. 
In 1971, Gene was elected a trustee of 
Thorncreek 
Township. 
Additionally, 
Gene 
oversaw the township’s public services; served 
on the Whitley County School Board; helped 
found the Tri-Lakes Baptist Church; was a 
member of Gideons International; served as 
president of the National Solid Waste Associa-
tion Council and was a member of the Colum-
bia City Rotary Club. 
Gene’s dedication to his community earned 
him the opportunity to meet several notable 
public figures, including President George W. 
Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Senator 
Richard Lugar, and Governor Otis Bowen. 
Separately, Gene operated his own sanitation 
business before selling it in 1991. 
This is a testament to Gene’s peerless de-
votion to service for which his community, and 
our country, is grateful. Though he is no 
longer with us, Gene’s spirit endures in the 
hearts and minds of all those he touched.

HONORING THE LIFE OF HAROLD 
KELLER 
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Harold Keller of 
Mount Joy, who recently passed away. 
Harold will be remembered for his life of 
service and building a stronger community in 
Mount Joy. He was a proud Rotarian, serving 
as President of the Mount Joy Rotary Club. 
He additionally served as a member of the 
Mount Joy Borough Council and Mount Joy 
Chamber of Commerce. Harold and his wife 
Helen were known as Mr. & Mrs. Santa in 
Mount Joy, bringing happiness to children and 
residents for over 35 years. Harold generously 
supported charitable organizations across the 
community and supported those in need, for 
instance, donating food to those impacted by 
Hurricane Agnes while his own home was 
flooded. 
Harold pursued his professional dream of 
becoming an auctioneer, opening Keller Auc-
tions in 1960, which is now in its third genera-
tion. Harold served during many benefit auc-
tions to support community organizations 
across the region and in 2012, was inducted 
into the Pennsylvania Auctioneers Hall of 
Fame. 
Harold enjoyed every moment with his fam-
ily, and we offer prayers of comfort for those 
who grieve his passing. Harold is survived by 
his loving family, including Helen, his wife of 
68 years, their eight children, nineteen grand-
children, and 28 great-grandchildren.

Family Health Centers, a federally qualified 
health center that has grown in size and 
scope to become one of the largest non-profits 
in our area, providing health care to more than 
45,000 individuals annually. Serving as Family 
Health Centers’ CEO since 1998 and as As-
sistant Director for 17 years prior to that, Bill 
oversaw the growth of their brick-and-mortar 
footprint in our area, expanding the number of 
health center locations in our region. He also 
helped oversee their tremendous growth in 
services provided, in patients served, and cer-
tainly in the rise of positive health outcomes 
for the countless Louisvillians that walked 
through their doors seeking care. 
During consideration and the subsequent 
implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Bill 
was at the forefront, advocating for increasing 
access to care while using his voice and pas-
sion for those often unheard. As we worked to 
expand services across our city, it was Bill’s 
guidance I sought out in order to be sure that 
we could do the most good possible for the 
most people. And so, it was no surprise when 
we saw our uninsured rate plummet as people 
began receiving the free preventive and other 
health services now available to them—just 
like Bill said they would if we’d just work to-
gether to make it happen. Along the way, he 
and his staff never hesitated to go above and 
beyond what was needed to make sure that 
our community was well-served, that people 
received the quality care they needed, and 
that everyone he crossed paths with knew that 
Family Health Centers was there and ready to 
help. 
Bill had previously announced his plan to re-
tire in early 2020, but as the COVID–19 pan-
demic reached our borders and began to 
spread, he put Louisville families first and 
stayed at the helm of this critical public health 
organization in order to help lead us through 
this public health crisis. Bill’s tremendous 
knowledge on public health matters, his early 
efforts to help ramp up testing in the commu-
nities he serves, and in his continued focus to 
this day on making sure that vaccines are 
available and accessible in every neighbor-
hood in our city—especially those that are so 
often overlooked or underserved—has been 
invaluable. 
Reflecting on his upcoming retirement, Bill 
said, ‘‘I’ve been guided by the belief that 
health care is a right not a privilege. We have 
a long way to go to achieve this goal in our 
community, but we have made significant 
strides over the decades.’’ 
I’m proud to share that belief, but I’m even 
more proud to say that those strides would not 
have been possible without Bill’s selfless dedi-
cation to his profession, his wealth of knowl-
edge in the public health field, and his 
unyielding commitment to improving the lives 
of our fellow Louisvillians. 
Bill has not only improved lives, but has 
saved them and left a lasting mark on our city, 
our commonwealth, and this great Nation. I 
wish him nothin but the very best in retirement 
and look forward to seeing him soon. Con-
gratulations and thanks for a job well done, 
my friend.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JOSH 
LUCAS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of high school 
senior Josh Lucas who passed away Sunday, 
May 16. He was an admirable young man with 
a bright future, and I join countless members 
of the Tuscaloosa community in mourning his 
loss. 
Josh was a senior at Northside High School 
meant to graduate on Friday, May 21. He was 
a football player and enlisted in the Alabama 
National Guard and intended to pursue a ca-
reer in the military following graduation. He 
was known as a hard worker, loyal friend, and 
a diligent athlete. 
I join Josh’s friends, family, fellow guards-
men, and teammates in mourning his loss. I 
can say with certainty Josh would have had 
an outstanding career in the military. I offer my 
most sincere condolences to those who had 
the opportunity to know and love Josh and 
continue to keep them in my prayers.

HONORING CHIEF SPECIAL WAR-

ZACKARY MILLER 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of U.S. Navy Chief Spe-
cial Warfare Operator Zackary Miller, a highly 
decorated Navy SEAL, who was taken far too 
early by cancer at the age of 39. He died on 
June 4, 2021 in Virginia Beach, Virginia with 
his family, closest loved ones, and teammates 
by his side. He was an American hero who 
dedicated his life in service of our country. 
Zack grew up in Columbus, Georgia and 
Mobile, Alabama. In 2000, he graduated from 
McGill-Toolen Catholic High School where he 
played baseball, basketball, and was captain 
of the football team. Zack received a scholar-
ship to play football at Millsaps College in 
Jackson, Mississippi before transferring to the 
University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. He grad-
uated in 2004 with a bachelor’s degree in po-
litical science.

Zack’s athletic prowess and leadership apti-
tude drove him to enlist in the U.S. Navy in 
2004. 
He 
first 
served 
as 
an 
Aviation 
Ordnanceman onboard the USS Nimitz before 
realizing his dream of becoming a Navy SEAL. 
During his 16 years in the Navy, he became 
a highly decorated combat veteran with seven 
deployments and numerous awards for valor 
including the Bronze Star Medal with Valor, 
Joint Service Commendation Medal with Valor, 
and three Navy and Marine Corps Com-
mendation Medals with Valor, each for distinct 
heroic actions during combat operations world-
wide. 
Zack was a devoted son, partner, friend, 
and teammate. He was known for his unparal-
leled work ethic that was only matched by his 
endlessly positive attitude, sense of humor, 
and charm. Madam Speaker, today I ask my 
colleagues to join Zack’s family, friends, and 
teammates in celebrating a life well lived, rec-
ognizing the sacrifices he made for all of us, 
and extending our deepest gratitude for his 
service to our country.

THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS 
ESSENTIAL ACT OF 2021 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, The 
Second Amendment Is Essential Act will clas-
sify, by law, the firearms industry as a ‘‘critical 
infrastructure sector’’ and those it employs as 
‘‘essential workers’’ by amending the Home-
land Security Act of 2002 and the USA Patriot 
Act of 2001. The changes define any business 
or employees who manufacture or deal fire-
arms and ammunition as critical infrastructure 
for the purposes of federal guidance to States 
during an emergency. 
The Homeland Security Act of 2002 directed 
the Administrator of the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS) to establish guidelines for 
States regarding who should constitute ‘‘crit-
ical infrastructure workers’’ in the event of a 
natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man- 
made disaster. Throughout the COVID–19 
pandemic, these individuals have often been 
referred to as ‘‘essential workers.’’ 
Similarly, the USA Patriot Act defined ‘‘crit-
ical infrastructure’’ as ‘‘systems and assets, 
whether physical or virtual, so vital to the 
United States that the incapacity or destruction 
of such systems and assets would have a de-
bilitating impact on security, national economic 
security, national public health or safety, or 
any combination of those matters.’’ 
Americans’ rights, including the right to keep 
and bear arms, are no less essential during a 
state of emergency. In fact, the right to defend 
one’s self and one’s home is most essential 
during a state of emergency. Furthermore, 
states of emergency merit heightened vigi-
lance to protect against unnecessary and un-
constitutional government outreach. 
In 2020, gun sales increased by 64 percent 
as Americans sought to exercise their Second 
Amendment rights so they could have peace 
of mind during a turbulent time. Firearms man-
ufacturers and dealers should not be forced by 
government to close in a time when demand 
for their products is through the roof. This leg-
islation will ensure that the Second Amend-
ment can be freely enjoyed by Americans 
when they need it most: in times of crisis.

THANKING CHARLENE BEST FOR 
HER SERVICE TO THE HOUSE 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to thank my constituent, Charlene Best, for 
nineteen years of outstanding service to the 
United States House of Representatives. She 
retired on June 3 from her role as Manager 
with the Asset Management Department of Lo-
gistics and Support. 
Charlene has had a very distinguished ca-
reer prior to her House employment. In high 
school and into college, she worked with the 
Department of the Navy. After her graduation 
in 1995, she went to work for the National 
Science Foundation as an Administrative As-
sistant, followed by a stint with the Census 
Bureau from 1999 to 2000. Later, she worked 
as an Executive Assistant for Booz, Allen, 
Hamilton. 
Charlene had long wished to be a House 
employee and began interviewing in 2002, 
earning a position as a Special Assistant for 
the Office of the CAO in the Office Systems 
Management. She quickly moved through the 
ranks and became a Supervisor and, eventu-
ally, Manager with First Call from 2007 
through 2015, before moving up to her current 
position. Charlene also served as a Move Co-
ordinator during the many Congressional Tran-
sitions and brought her special talents and ex-
pertise to Members of Congress and their 
staffs. 
When asked about the highlights of her ca-
reer, Charlene has said how much she appre-
ciated the mentorship of her boss, Tom 
Coyne, Chief Logistics Officer, and she credits 
him with helping her to grow professionally. 
She has also cited one of her first supervisors, 
Carol Nichols, as someone who saw potential 
in her and invested time and energy to help 
her advance in her career. 
One notable contribution that Charlene 
made to the House was her participation in 
the lying-in-state of Rosa Parks, for which she 
earned Congressional recognition. She re-
members this event with sober reflection. In 
addition, one of the most cherished memories 
from her House career was being present in 
the Capitol for the first inauguration of Presi-
dent Barack Obama. While relaying the story 
to my staff, she recalled being in the hallway 
of the Capitol on the path leading out to the 
inaugural stage, when President-Elect Obama 
walked within ten feet of where she was 
standing and gave her a friendly wink prior to 
stepping out onto the stage. She loves to tell 
this story to demonstrate the great honors she 
has felt working for the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Charlene, like so many House employees, 
had been teleworking during the COVID–19 
pandemic, and she said that she felt lucky to 
have spent some ‘home time’ with her daugh-
ter Jordyn, a graduating senior. It was a wel-
come opportunity to spend quality time with 
Jordyn before she heads off to college in the 
fall. In retirement, Charlene is looking forward 
to enjoying more time spent with her family 
and pursuing other opportunities. 
I hope all of my colleagues will join me in 
extending our congratulations to Charlene 
Best for her many years of dedication and out-
standing contributions to this House. I wish 
her many wonderful and fulfilling years in re-
tirement.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
HERSHEL DEAN HOOD 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Hershel 
Dean Hood who passed away at North Mis-
sissippi Medical Center on May 16 of this 
year. I join countless others in mourning his 
loss. 
For three decades, Hershel was a conductor 
for the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad. 
He served in the United States National Guard 
as a Master Sergeant and was the mainte-
nance contractor at Tschudi Courts in Amory 
for 15 years. He was also an auxiliary deputy 
with the Monroe County Sherriff’s Department 
for 17 years. Hershel was known and loved in 
his community. 
At Cason Baptist Church, Hershel wore 
many hats. He was the choir director, a musi-
cian, deacon, and children’s worker. He was 
passionate about music and a member of the 
Nite-Liters band and the Singing Prophets 
Quartet. His record ‘‘Little Band of Gold’’ 
topped charts in England and he was inducted 
into the Rock-A-Billy Hall of Fame. He fre-
quently drummed for Elvis Presley. 
Left to cherish his memory are wife of 56 
years, Ann Oliver Hood; sons, Gregory Dean 
Hood and Andy Hood; sister, Judy Holman; 
brothers, Billy Ray Hood and Lamar Hood and 
multiple nieces and nephews. 
I join countless Mississippians in mourning 
the loss of Mr. Hershel Dean Hood. He was a 
gifted musician, loving husband and father, 
and a leader in his community.

IN RECOGNITION OF DAVID JOHN 
SHAWVER 
HON. MICHELLE STEEL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize David John Shawver as he com-
pletes his tenure as Chairman of the Orange 
County Sanitation District Board of Directors. 
Chairman Shawver served in this capacity 
from December 2018 through June 2021. 
Throughout his tenure, Chairman Shawver has 
been committed to providing an affordable 
service to the community and understands the 
importance of keeping with OC San’s mission 
of protecting the public health and the environ-
ment. 
Under 
his 
leadership, 
Chairman 
Shawver and the Board of Directors under-
stood the financial hardship COVID–19 cre-
ated for many of our ratepayers, ensuring the 
service cost for consumers was less than $1 
per day. Chairman Shawver’s commitment to 
affordable water and water reuse has allowed 
OC San to move in the direction of recycling 
100 percent of its reclaimable flow through the 
Groundwater Replenishment System (GWRS), 
a joint project between OC San and the Or-
ange County Water District. Upon completion 
of this project in 2023, GWRS will produce 
130 million gallons of high-quality water every 
day, which will be enough water for 1 million 
residents in north and central Orange County. 
We thank Chairman Shawver for his years of 
service and dedication to OC San and the 
community he serves.

WILLIAM ‘‘BUD’’ MONAGHAN 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend Cherry Hill, New 
Jersey Police Chief William ‘‘Bud’’ Monaghan, 
Cherry Hill Police Department. 
After 26 years of service, Chief of Police 
William ‘‘Bud’’ Monaghan is set to retire in Oc-
tober 2021. Chief Monaghan joined the police 
department in 1995 as a patrolman. He has 
led the police force since January 2014. Dur-
ing his years as Chief of Police, he worked to 
strengthen the community by creating close 
ties with the public. Chief Monaghan built rela-
tionships with cultural, religious, youth and 
civic groups to connect the Police Department 
with its area. 
Chief Monaghan regularly attended commu-
nity meetings to participate in the discussions 
about Cherry Hill’s neighborhoods. He is de-
voted to keeping the area protected and safe. 
He also focuses on police transparency and 
up to date technology to continue to provide 
aid and comfort to the residents. 
The Cherry Hill Police Department is com-
mitted to protecting both life and property. 
Cherry Hill, New Jersey is home to over sev-
enty-thousand residents and the police depart-
ment averages one-hundred twenty thousand 
calls for service per year. Chief Monaghan 
and his police department provide the highest 
level of police service while also enhancing 
the quality of life in the area. 
Chief Monaghan’s dedication to the police 
department and its 136 full-time sworn officers 
has resulted in a safe and thankful community 
that fosters growth and acceptance. Chief 
Monaghan describes his time and service at 
the Cherry Hill police department as ‘‘the 
honor of a lifetime.’’ His successor will be cho-
sen in the coming months, but it is evident 
that Chief Monaghan’s impact on the Cherry 
Hill Police Department will be appreciated for 
years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Police Chief William Monaghan in his 
retirement and recognizing his more than two 
and a half decades of service to the Township 
of Cherry Hill and their Police Department.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
LIEUTENANT LANE FOWLER 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the retirement of Cor-
inth 
Police 
Department 
Lieutenant 
Lane 
Fowler, Sr. 
In 2004, Lt. Fowler joined the Corinth Police 
Department. His desire to help people was the 
reason he chose to launch a career in law en-
forcement. Over the course of his 17-year ca-
reer, Lt. Fowler fulfilled his duties with a sense 
of pride. 
One of his most rewarding achievements 
was serving as the leader of the Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) Program. 
During his eight years working with fifth grade 
students, Lt. Fowler taught them about the im-
portance of living a healthy lifestyle and mak-
ing good choices with their lives. Lt. Fowler 
said it was his goal to teach children that law 
enforcement officers are not to be feared. It 
was his goal to build good relationships with 
members of the community of all ages. 
On Friday, June 11, Lt. Fowler’s retirement 
was celebrated during a ceremony hosted by 
his fellow police officers with the Corinth Po-
lice Department. It was my honor to thank him 
for his dedication to the citizens of Corinth and 
for his pledge to protect their safety. Lt. Fowl-
er’s service will always be remembered. 
Lt. Fowler is married to Tonia Fowler. They 
have five children: Kacie Blakney; Johnson 
Fowler, Jr.; Sidney Robertson; Mikki Holmes, 
and Justin Holmes. The Fowlers have six 
grandchildren: 
Lainey 
Blakney; 
Corbin 
Blakney; Caben Robbins; Eli Robbins; Hadley 
Holmes, and Anna Grace Holmes. 
I am grateful for Lt. Fowler’s lifetime of serv-
ice to North Mississippi and thank him for his 
commitment to the Corinth community. 
COMMEMORATING LGBTQ PRIDE 
MONTH 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
this June, we celebrate Pride Month in soli-
darity with our fellow Americans, and world 
citizens, who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisex-
ual, Transgender, and Queer, also known as 
the LGBTQ community. We celebrate the 
courage it takes for LGBTQ people to openly 
and freely be their true selves, and we cele-
brate to show them compassion and under-
standing, even if they have not yet made the 
decision to affirm their identity publicly. 
The struggle to attain full equality for 
LGBTQ Americans is far from over, but we 
can take solace in recent triumphs: the repeal 
of ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’’ Obergefell v. 
Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage in 
the United States, Bostock v. Clayton County, 
GA, which prohibited employment discrimina-
tion based on sex or sexual orientation, and 
President Biden’s lifting of the ban on 
Transgender people from serving in the U.S. 
Armed Forces. 
But also, during this Pride Month, we must 
not forget the struggles that lie ahead for the 
LGBTQ community—most notably, attaining 
the right to live freely, with equal protection of 
the laws and without fear of violence or perse-
cution. For many LGBTQ people, especially 
those of color, this dream is not yet within 
reach. I implore those Americans that face ad-
versity for their sex or sexual orientation not to 
despair; as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. para-
phrased the words of the abolitionist Theodore 
Parker, ‘the arc of the moral universe is long, 
but it bends toward justice.’ 
It is incumbent upon each and every one of 
us living in this country to extend the kindness 
and respect to our neighbor that we, in turn, 
would wish to receive. LGBTQ Americans live 
and work in every city and county in our na-
tion. They live in communities that are rural, 
urban, suburban and everything in between. 
They are a diverse community that spans all 
races, ethnicities, nations, and creeds, but 
they all have one thing in common—they were 
created by God and in his image.

School in Monterey, California. 
While Okon’s previous commands include 
locations such as Osaka, Japan, and Mon-
terey, California, his tenure at CNMOC will be 
fondly remembered for successes such as 
procuring funding for a new oceanographic 
survey ship (T–AGS 67) built at VT Halter Ma-
rine Pascagoula, Mississippi, launching the 
Unmanned Systems Operations Center in the 
Naval Oceanographic Office, and endorsing a 
Memorandum of Understanding with NOAA to 
execute language in the Commercial Engage-
ment for Ocean Technology (CENOTE) Act. 
He was also instrumental in overseeing sev-
eral Naval Technology Exercises along the 
Mississippi Gulf Coast and Port of Gulfport 
Rear Adm. Okon has played an influential 
role in fostering community engagement by 
educating organizations on the critical con-
tributions the Navy makes to our National Se-
curity. His collection of personal awards in-
cludes the Legion of Merit, Defense Meri-
torious Service Medal, in addition to various 
campaign and service awards.

and privilege to recognize Rear Admiral John 
Okon today for his selfless duty and commit-
ment to the Navy and to the United States of 
America.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE DEDICA-
TION OF SPC HOLLY MCGEOGH 
MEMORIAL HIGHWAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the dedication of the 
SPC Holly McGeogh Memorial Highway in 
Taylor, Michigan. By dedicating this highway 
in the name of SPC McGeogh, an American 
hero who paid the ultimate sacrifice, we are 
ensuring that generations of Michiganders and 
Americans will remember her name and story 
of selfless courage. This ceremony held today 
is an important reminder to us all of her dedi-
cation and love of this country. It is important 
that we never forget the first female soldier 
from Michigan to lose her life in the war in 
Iraq. 
As a daughter of Dearborn and Taylor, SPC 
McGeogh wanted nothing more than to serve 
her country and fight for our freedom. A life-
long Michigander and a dedicated member of 
our military from the very beginning, she 
served for four years as a Cadet in the Junior 
ROTC program at Truman High School in 
Taylor, Michigan. 
From Truman High in 2002, McGeogh ful-
filled her dream of joining the U.S. Army and 
hoped to continue her education and begin a 
career in Army intelligence or psychology. 
Upon joining the Army, SPC McGeogh was 
assigned to Company A, 4th Forward Support 
Battalion, 4th Infantry Division, and stationed 
at Fort Hood in Texas. She was sent to Iraq 
at age 19 where she served as a light truck 
mechanic. On January 4, 2004, while de-
ployed in combat for Operation Iraqi Freedom, 
SPC Holly McGeogh and two of her fellow sol-
diers were killed by a roadside bomb outside 
of Kirkuk. 
During her time overseas, she was known 
to eagerly volunteer for every mission and pa-
trol and taught games like duck-duck-goose to 
Iraqi children. In one of her final phone calls 
to her parents, she reminded them that ‘‘if she 
should die, we should remember that she died 
for a reason.’’ Her family said it best, ‘‘Holly is 
another reminder that our freedom truly is not 
free.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the legacy of SPC Holly 
McGeogh and her unwavering bravery and de-
sire to serve our country. The dedication of 
the SPC Holly McGeogh Memorial Highway 
will ensure that all who pass through will rec-
ognize her service and honor the ultimate sac-
rifice that SPC McGeogh has made.

Dale Fortenberry as alderman and mayor of 
Farmington. 
Dale was elected Alderman on July 1, 2001 
and served until his Election as mayor on July 
1, 2005. Dale diligently served the city of 
Farmington for 16 years as mayor. During his 
time as mayor, he worked diligently to acquire 
$1.2 million in grants for the City of Farm-
ington to provide wastewater collection, city 
hall renovation, and to build a city park. His 
persistence for Heritage Community Park 
showed when the City of Farmington received 
a 1st Place award for Community Develop-
ment at the Mississippi Municipal League Con-
ference in June 2019. He also served 3 terms 
as Chairman of the North Mississippi Mayor’s 
Association and was a member of the Execu-
tive Board of Directors for the State of Mis-
sissippi Municipal League and Legislative 
Committee. 
Prior to his career as mayor, Dale supported 
local Corinth businesses by working at Tyrone 
Hydraulics for 35 years and Little Brothers 
Construction for 10 years. 
Dale Fortenberry is the youngest son of 
Buford and Clara Fortenberry. Dale is origi-
nally from Leake County. He has been mar-
ried to Shirley Fortenberry since 1972 and has 
two children, Sammy and Nancy. He is pas-
sionate about the history of the Confederacy, 
his family, and the citizens of Farmington. 
I join many Mississippians in commemo-
rating the life of Mr. Dale Fortenberry. He was 
a loyal businessman, alderman, and mayor. 
INTRODUCING 
BILL 
TO 
COMBAT 
TRANSNATIONAL 
WHITE 
SU-
PREMACIST 
EXTREMISTS 
AND 
STRENGTHEN INTELLIGENCE AS-
SESSMENTS ON TRANSNATIONAL 
WHITE SUPREMACIST THREATS 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce a bill that will address intelligence 
gaps and sharpen our focus on transnational 
white supremacist extremist threats. Specifi-
cally, this bill will improve our federal intel-
ligence agencies and prioritize the white su-
premacist extremist threat, including its ties to 
international groups. This bill builds on pre-
vious work done by a number of congressional 
committees, including the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence’s Intelligence 
Authorizations (IAA) over the past few years. 
As the Chairman of the Counterterrorism, 
Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation 
(C3) Subcommittee on the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence, I am proud 
to strengthen our earlier provisions in the IAA 
and introduce this new bill. I am also ex-
tremely grateful for the collaborative efforts 
and support of Chairman ADAM SCHIFF—who 
joins me as an original cosponsor of this bill, 
and whose work was invaluable in developing 
this legislation for introduction today. 
This 
bill 
mandates 
that 
the 
National 
Counterterrorism Center—alongside the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security—explore and ana-
lyze more completely the ideology and objec-
tives driving white supremacist groups with 
transnational connections, including their lead-
ership and operational structure. Currently, the 
United States government too often and too 
heavily relies on outside research organiza-
tions for detailed analysis of white supremacist 
extremists. It is imperative that United States 
government’s intelligence agencies and subor-
dinate organizations perform the high-level 
analysis needed to best utilize existing data, 
add additional data that may be missing, and 
ensure this is done on a national level. The 
new assessments required by this bill will 
allow lawmakers and the public to more com-
pletely understand the full scope of the 
transnational threat and will help foster a sus-
tained examination of its international impact 
well into the future. 
As a former law enforcement professional, I 
have warned my colleagues for a number of 
years that the threat of white supremacist ex-
tremist organizations has been growing worse. 
Today, this problem is the top terror threat to 
American lives, and the United States Govern-
ment needs to take actions that reflect this 
heightened priority, especially since the Janu-
ary 6th insurrection and home-grown attack on 
the U.S. Capitol. While there has been im-
provement under the Biden Administration, 
plus increased Congressional efforts, the Intel-
ligence Community continues to place a pri-
ority on the international terror groups and 
their offenses, while ignoring the domestic ter-
ror threats. While some were taken by sur-
prise by domestic terrorists that blew up the 
federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, we 
should never again be caught by surprise—es-
pecially when we have the ability and the duty

ligence assessments. 
I strongly believe this bill will complement 
and enhance the recently announced Depart-
ment of Justice strategy to combat the domes-
tic terror and domestic violent extremism 
threats, so I urge all my colleagues to join me 
in cosponsoring this bill.

RETIREMENT OF JORDAN BARAB 
FROM 
THE 
EDUCATION 
AND 
LABOR COMMITTEE 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the service of Jordan Barab 
who served as the senior health and safety 
advisor to the Education & Labor Committee 
after serving in senior positions in the Occupa-
tional 
Safety 
and 
Health 
Administration 
(OSHA) in two different Administrations. When 
Jordan announced his retirement from the 
Committee, Members of the Committee ex-
pressed deep appreciation for the expertise he 
imparted to the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, especially when we were confronted 
with the spread of COVID–19. 
Jordan’s experience working to enhance 
protections for healthcare workers during the 
H1N1 flu epidemic—when he led the Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Administration as the 
Acting Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occu-
pational Safety and Health during the Obama 
Administration—informed his counsel to the 
Committee and Congress to have OSHA de-
velop an Emergency Temporary Standard to 
protect workers during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. That expertise was also helpful to the 
Commonwealth of Virginia which became the 
first state to develop its own emergency tem-
porary standard to protect workers from 
COVID–19. As a result, other states had a 
model with which to follow suit. 
Jordan also worked with Representative JOE 
COURTNEY (CT) to advance legislation requir-
ing health care and social service employers 
to implement plans to prevent workplace vio-
lence in the House-passed bipartisan Work-
place Violence Prevention for Health Care and 
Social Service Workers Act (H.R. 1195). He 
made sure that public employees in states 
without OSHA protections received workplace 
violence protections through Medicare. He 
also worked with Representative JUDY CHU 
(CA) on legislation to provide OSHA protec-
tions for workers from heat stress. 
Over the decades, Jordan has been at the 
forefront of our nation’s efforts to make sure 
workers come home safely from their job 
every day. He was a key leader in efforts to 
seek stronger worker protections regarding 
bloodborne pathogens, tuberculosis, and ergo-
nomic hazards. Jordan also worked for five 
years to develop safety recommendations to 
prevent catastrophic chemical accidents at the 
Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigations 
Board (CSB), as well as nearly two decades 
as Assistant Director of Research for Health 
and Safety with the American Federation of 
State 
Municipal 
and 
County 
Employees 
(AFSCME). 
In his earlier work with the Committee, 
under the leadership of Chairman George Mil-
ler (CA), Jordan focused on legislation to pre-
vent combustible dust fires and explosions— 
an issue brought into sharp focus following the 
2008 dust explosion which killed 14 and left 
over 40 injured at a sugar refinery in Port 
Wentworth, Georgia. Jordan was the lead 
staffer into the investigations and legislation to 
prevent the obliteration of workers’ lungs from 
the inhalation of a flavoring chemical used in 
popcorn called diacetyl. Jordan also examined 
the underreporting of injuries and illnesses, a 
practice that undermines effective workplace 
safety. 
Jordan’s dedication to the safety of workers 
has spanned across the Committee, OSHA, 
CSB, AFSCME and the labor movement. 
There is no question that there are many 
workers who avoided injury or illness because 
of workplace safety improvements that came 
about because of Jordan’s work. He remains 
a trusted advisor—and may not easily escape 
our inquiries when we have questions. 
On behalf of workers, their families, and the 
people of the country, I thank Jordan Barab 
for his service to the public and lasting con-
tribution to workplace safety.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF HENRY 
RANDLE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Henry 
Randle who recently lost his battle with can-
cer. He was a brave and selfless community 
servant and I join countless Mississippians in 
mourning his loss. 
Henry Randle was a graduate of Aberdeen 
High School class of 1989. He attended Mary 
Holmes College, Mississippi State University, 
and the Mississippi Law Enforcement Training 
Academy. In 2001, he joined the Mississippi 
National Guard. 
Mr. Randle began his military career as an 
Army Motor Transport Operator. In 2009, he 
earned a second occupation as a Petroleum 
Supply Specialist and has served in a variety 
of leadership positions in Engineer and a Ma-
neuver Unit. Over the course of his career, he 
has served in the Mississippi National Guard’s 
223rd Engineering Battalion, served in the 
Middle East—most recently in 2018 as an E6 
staff sergeant. He aided in hurricane Katrina 
recovery. 
Among Mr. Randle’s awards include a 
Armed Forces Reserves Medal with M Device, 
Army Achievement Medal, Army Commenda-
tion Medal, Army Reserve Components Over-
seas TRG Ribbon, Army Reserve Compo-
nents Achievement Medal, Army Service Rib-
bon, Combat Action Badge, Global War on 
Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on 
Terrorism Service Medal, National Defense 
Service Medal. He joined the Aberdeen Police 
Department in 1997 and served as a school 
resource officer. In April of 2008, Mr. Randle 
was elected as Aberdeen Police Chief. 
It was an honor to work with Henry in the 
Mississippi Guard as well as in law enforce-
ment. Henry Randle was an outstanding com-
munity leader who served his state and coun-
try well. I am grateful for his life of service to 
the Aberdeen community and offer my deep-
est condolences and most sincere prayers for 
all who know and love him.

JUNETEENTH NATIONAL 
INDEPENDENCE DAY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN 
OF RHODE ISLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the importance of celebrating 
Juneteenth as a national holiday. 
For a century after the last slaves were 
freed, Black Americans were denied the rights 
considered ‘‘unalienable’’ by the Constitution. 
Even after July 4, 1776, millions of enslaved 
people and their descendants would not expe-
rience independence for decades. Over the 
last 50 years, systemic racism has continued 
to hinder many who strive to live out the 
American Dream. 
Despite the issuance of the Emancipation 
Proclamation in 1863, Black people would re-
main enslaved in parts of the Confederacy for 
nearly two and a half years. On June 19, 
1865, Major General Gordon Granger arrived 
in Galveston, Texas, delivering news of the 
end of the Civil War and of slavery. 
The message he conveyed that day was 
simple. General Order Number 3 declared that 
‘‘. . . all slaves are free. This involves an ab-
solute equality of personal rights and rights of 
property, between former masters and slaves 
. . .’’ 
The following year, the newly liberated peo-
ple of Texas began celebrating Juneteenth as 
a celebration of answered prayers and new 
opportunities. 
This tradition slowly spread throughout the 
country, eventually becoming a holiday or day 
of observance in 49 states and the District of 
Columbia. My home state of Rhode Island has 
observed Juneteenth since 2012. 
While Juneteenth has been widely cele-
brated among African American communities 
since the end of the Civil War, the prominence 
of the holiday has grown significantly in recent 
years. 
I 
am 
proud 
to 
have 
supported 
the 
Juneteenth National Independence Day Act 
when it passed in Congress and was signed 
into law last week. It is my hope that June 
19th will serve as a day of reflection and an 
annual call to recommit ourselves to the Amer-
ican ideals of freedom and equality. 
For far too long, our society has denied the 
promise of these ideals to many Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E679 
June 22, 2021 
From the Jim Crow era until today, Black 
Americans have been the target of racism and 
bigotry, treated as second class citizens, de-
nied opportunity, and subjected to countless 
violent attacks by racist mobs and individuals. 
Over the last year, the United States has 
experienced the most intensive reckoning with 
slavery and its legacy since the Civil Rights 
Movement of the 1960s. 
The Black Lives Matter movement and na-
tionwide protests following the death of 
George Floyd have cast a light on the dis-
parate outcomes that persist for Black people 
in education, employment, interactions with 
the police, and numerous other aspects of ev-
eryday life. 
These disparities contribute to—and are in-
fluenced 
by—the 
intergenerational 
racial 
wealth gap. Recent studies show that Black 
children face significantly higher rates of 
downward economic mobility and lower rates 
of upward mobility compared to white children. 
For instance, a Black child born into a high- 
income family is as likely to end up in the bot-
tom 20 percent of earners as an adult as they 
are to remain in top 20 percent. In contrast, a 
white child born to parents with the same in-
come is five times more likely to remain in the 
top income quintile as they are to fall to the 
bottom of the income distribution. 
The systemic racism ingrained in American 
society must come to an end. As Members of 
Congress, we need to face this challenge 
head on, with clear eyes, open minds, and full 
hearts. Making Juneteenth a national holiday 
is a start, but our constituents have shown us 
that sustained Congressional inaction is no 
longer an option. 
This is the moment to pass comprehensive 
policing reform, protect and expand voting 
rights, and remove the vestiges of slavery 
from our social fabric for good. 
In the last two years, the House has passed 
the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and 
the Voting Rights Advancement Act. The 
Commission on the Social Status of Black 
Men and Boys Act was signed into law in De-
cember after passing both chambers with 
overwhelming bipartisan support. 
This is the kind of legislation we need to 
begin unwinding the political, economic, and 
societal policies that have disadvantaged 
Black Americans since Reconstruction. 
This Juneteenth, I hope my colleagues join 
me in reflecting on the myriad barriers to op-
portunity that exist for far too many Black 
Americans and in promoting concrete actions 
Congress can take to remove them.

CONGRESSIONAL LGBTQ+ EQUAL-
ITY 
CAUCUS 
IN 
COMMEMORA-
TION OF PRIDE MONTH 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 22, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as 
our country celebrates Pride Month this June, 
I rise as a Senior Member of the House Judi-
ciary Committee to affirm a basic truth: that 
we are all equal. 
I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman 
from Rhode Island, Mr. CICILLINE, and the 
Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus for 
organizing this special order in commemora-
tion of Pride Month. 
This month serves as an opportunity to re-
commit ourselves to making equality in every 
aspect of American life real for members of 
the LGBTQ+ community. 
It also serves as a reminder of both the 
shared struggle and collective joy found in the 
history and life experiences of queer and gen-
der non-conforming members of our society. 
Our country has come a long way in the 
fight for justice for all the queer and gender 
non-conforming members of our society. 
The Stonewall Uprisings in Greenwich Vil-
lage marked a watershed moment in the 
LGBTQ+ movement, reigniting the fight for 
justice and signaling a new chapter of 
progress in our country’s quest to ensure that 
fair treatment is the rule, never the exception. 
The Supreme Court’s 2015 decision in 
Obergefell v. Hodges enshrined fair treatment 
as the rule when the court affirmed same-sex 
couple’s right to marry the person they love, 
regardless of where they lived. 
Our country’s commitment to justice has 
been maintained by the tireless work of advo-
cates and communities at the forefront of so-
cial change. 
We know, however, that this work is unfin-
ished. 
As with every social movement, progress is 
met by resistance, and that resistance can 
only be overcome with unmatched persistence 
and fidelity to a basic truth enshrined in our 
belief: that all are created equal and worthy of 
human dignity. 
In keeping with this belief, we cannot forget 
the great champions of this cause, many of 
which I am proud to claim as fellow Texans. 
Sarah Fernandez, Judy Reeves, Tommy 
Ross, JD Doyle, Dalton DeHeart, Judge Jerry 
Simoneux, Judge Fran Watson—I thank them 
for their unwavering advocacy. 
I also want to recognize a few organizations 
that continue to do the hard and necessary 
work of keeping our communities safe, making 
them feel seen, and pushing our country to-
wards equality. 
The Houston GLBT Political Caucus, Save 
Our Sisters United, Montrose Grace Place, 
and the Montrose Center—their work is impor-
tant and valued. 
Lastly, I wish to pay tribute to Monica Rob-
erts and Ray Hill. 
Monica Roberts, whose death leaves a gap-
ing hole in the hearts of the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity in Houston. 
Monica worked as a trailblazing journalist 
and advocate, never failing to center the sto-
ries of Black trans people and shining light on 
the issues often ignored by the media. 
Ray Hill co-organized the first gay rights or-
ganization in Houston in 1967, fiercely advo-
cated for those living with HIV and AIDS, and 
always sought to advance the cause of equal-
ity, despite the hardships. 
There are more than 46,000 same-sex cou-
ples in Texas, and about a third of LGBTQ+ 
Texans are raising children. 
According to an analysis by the Williams In-
stitute at the UCLA School of Law, approxi-
mately 930,000 Texans identify as lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender or queer. 
If LGBTQ+ Texans were a city unto them-
selves, they’d be the 5th most populous mu-
nicipality in the state, just behind Austin, and 
significantly larger than El Paso. 
These families and these individuals all ben-
efit from the incredible advocacy and sacrifice 
of the aforementioned organizations and indi-
viduals. 
From the Ryan White Care Act to the Mat-
thew Sheppard Act passed by Congress to the 
Lawrence v. Texas and Obergefell v. Hodges 
decisions announced by the Supreme Court, it 
is clear that social change cannot simply be 
hoped for—it must be codified, protected, and 
expanded to account for the real discrimina-
tion still shouldered by the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity. 
In particular, I want to underscore the impor-
tance of intersectionality, and recognize that 
queer people of color face disproportionate 
burdens 
ranging 
from 
violence 
against 
transgender people to higher rates of youth 
homelessness and HIV infection. 
On behalf of LGBTQ+ Texans and all Amer-
icans, I call upon the Senate to follow the 
House’s example and pass H.R. 5, the Equal-
ity Act now. 
I call on my colleagues in Congress to move 
forward with key legislative priorities ranging 
from ending HIV criminalization, passing the 
HIV epidemic plan, and enacting criminal jus-
tice reform that puts a stop to policies, which 
above all harm incarcerated transgender peo-
ple. 
For LGBTQ+ communities to be truly 
seen—to be valued—in our country, they must 
be accounted for in our policies and actions, 
not simply tokenized in political rhetoric and 
corporate merchandise. 
It is time to go beyond political rhetoric and 
make real the promise of equality, opportunity, 
and justice for every American—irrespective of 
who they are and who they love. 
Let us be unequivocal in our support and 
love for the LGBTQ+ community, not just in 
words, but in actions.

TEXAS LAWMAKERS ADVANCE BILLS BLOCKING 
ACCESS
TO
GENDER-AFFIRMING
HEALTH 
CARE
DESPITE
OPPOSITION
FROM
LGBTQ 
TEXANS, MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS 
(By Megan Munce) 
Equality Texas CEO Ricardo Martinez said 
Texas has filed more anti-LGBTQ bills this 
session than any other state legislature. 
Before undergoing gender confirmation 
surgery at age 17, Indigo Giles had to get ap-
proval from a doctor, a therapist and the 
hospital where the surgery would be per-
formed to ensure there were no options left 
besides surgery. To even get to that point, 
Indigo’s father Neil said it took time-con-
suming research and several reflections as a 
family before going forward with the process. 
The surgery’s impact was immediate, said 
Indigo, now 19, who identifies as nonbinary. 
They were able to wear the clothes they 
wanted to, and their confidence in school and 
with friends significantly increased. Most 
significantly, the surgery helped alleviate 
their severe depression caused in part by 
gender dysphoria—discomfort related to feel-
ing a disconnect between one’s personal gen-
der identity and the gender assigned to them 
at birth. 
But under a slate of legislation moving in 
the Texas Senate and House, Indigo wouldn’t 
have been able to make such a decision until 
their 18th birthday. In fact, no transgender 
child in Texas would be able to pursue pu-
berty blockers, hormone treatment or sur-
gery for the purpose of gender confirmation. 
Transgender Texas children, their parents, 
medical groups and businesses have vocally 
opposed many of the bills lawmakers are 
pursuing. Equality Texas CEO Ricardo Mar-
tinez said Texas has filed more anti-LGBTQ 
bills this session than any other state legis-
lature. 
‘‘It’s insulting,’’ Indigo said. ‘‘These law-
makers think that we don’t know what we

want with our own bodies and we’re not able 
to say what we want and mean it.’’ 
House Bill 1399 would prohibit health care 
providers and physicians from performing 
gender confirmation surgery or prescribing, 
administering or supplying puberty blockers 
or hormone treatment to anyone under the 
age of 18. The House Public Health Com-
mittee advanced the bill Friday. 
Senate Bill 1311 by Sen. Bob Hall, R-Edge-
wood, would revoke the medical license of 
health care providers and physicians who 
perform such procedures or prescribe such 
drugs or hormones to people younger than 18. 
The Senate State Affairs Committee ad-
vanced that bill Monday. 
The Senate last week passed Senate Bill 29, 
which would prevent public school students 
from participating in sports teams unless 
their sex assigned at birth aligns with the 
team’s designation. While that bill would 
only affect students in K–12 schools, two 
similar bills in the House would include col-
leges and universities in that mandate. 
SB 29 has been referred to the House Public 
Education Committee, which is slated to 
meet Tuesday and hear testimony on iden-
tical legislation that was introduced in the 
lower chamber. On Wednesday night, the 
chair of that committee told the Houston 
Chronicle that the companion legislation, 
House Bill 4042, is likely dead. 
‘‘That bill is probably not going to make it 
out 
of 
committee,’’ 
state 
Rep. 
Harold 
Dutton, D-Houston, told the Chronicle. ‘‘We 
just don’t have the votes for it . . . But I 
promised the author that I’d give him a 
hearing, and we did.’’ 
Last session, Dade Phelan, the Beaumont 
Republican who is now House Speaker, dem-
onstrated a lack of appetite for bills restrict-
ing rights for LGBTQ Texans. 
‘‘It’s completely unacceptable,’’ he said at 
the time. ‘‘This is 2019.’’ 
Last week, Rep. Bryan Slaton, R-Royse 
City, tried to amend a bill on the House floor 
that would fund prescription drugs for unin-
sured Texans so that it would exclude hor-
mone and puberty suppression treatments. 
That amendment failed after it was noted 
that existing bills were addressing such 
treatments. 
MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS UNITE IN OPPOSITION TO 
BILLS 
In public testimony this year, transgender 
Texans and their parents have testified in 
near unanimous opposition to the bills. Sev-
eral parents described their experience testi-
fying as ‘‘terrifying,’’ worrying their testi-
mony would be used against them should the 
bills’ penalties become law. Under Senate 
Bill 1646, which the Senate State Affairs 
Committee passed Tuesday night, they could 
be labeled child abusers for allowing their 
children to receive gender affirming treat-
ment. 
That bill comes after Jeff Younger at-
tracted the attention of Gov. Greg Abbott 
and other top Texas Republicans in 2019 after 
a dispute between him and his ex-wife turned 
into a court battle over whether he could op-
pose his child’s transition. Younger, among 
others testifying in support of these bills, 
emphasized young children’s lack of brain 
development and claimed parents and social 
media pressure children into identifying as 
transgender. 
But experts say social media and social 
pressure have nothing to do with it. 
‘‘There’s literally zero evidence or research 
to suggest that that’s true,’’ said Megan 
Mooney, past president of the Texas Psycho-
logical Association. 
According to Mooney, children as young as 
2 or 3 can develop ideas about gender iden-
tity. By 6 or 7, she said, their sense of gender 
identity is relatively stable. 
Lisa Stanton, a Houston mother, said her 
daughter Maya began expressing her gender 
identity as soon as she could talk. Lisa said 
Maya would speak about a fairy who would 
use magic to turn her into a girl. 
Maya had no access to social media, Lisa 
said, and neither of them even had the lan-
guage to discuss gender dysphoria or being 
transgender. What’s more, Maya has a twin 
brother who Lisa said has been raised ex-
actly the same way as his sister, but has 
never expressed gender dysphoria. 
At 10 years old, Maya hasn’t received any 
medical treatment yet. Lisa said in the fu-
ture, she may have to use puberty blockers— 
a medical treatment legislators want to ban, 
but experts say is completely safe. 
Marjan Linnell, a general pediatrician, tes-
tified on behalf of six different state and na-
tional medical associations and said in com-
mittee that ‘‘organized medicine stands 
united to strongly oppose both SB 1646 and 
SB 1311.’’ 
In an interview with The Texas Tribune, 
Linnell explained that puberty suppression 
treatment has been used for decades to pre-
vent children from going through puberty 
too soon. Once those children reach an ap-
propriate age, their treatment stops and nat-
ural puberty occurs. Linnell said the same is 
true for transgender children, for whom pu-
berty can often exacerbate poor mental 
health. 
‘‘The point is to have a reversible treat-
ment that can give them some time,’’ she 
said. ‘‘That not only helps to gain some time 
to make sure we’re making an appropriate 
and best practice medical decision for these 
kids and families, but we also know it can be 
incredibly important for preserving the men-
tal health of our kids that are going through 
gender affirming care.’’ 
THE MENTAL HEALTH TOLL OF GENDER 
DYSPHORIA AND SOCIAL MARGINALIZATION 
Hall, the Edgewood Republican, argued 
during a committee hearing that gender dys-
phoria would pass after puberty for many 
children. He claimed that children feeling 
like they’re in the wrong body is akin to 
them being ‘‘tomboys’’ and ‘‘sensitive kids’’ 
who could later turn into the ‘‘best looking 
cheerleaders’’ and ‘‘toughest football play-
ers’’ by high school. 
But both Mooney and Linnell said puberty 
can increase rates of anxiety, depression and 
suicidal ideation for transgender children, 
and delaying treatment until 18 could worsen 
the 
existing 
disproportionate 
rate 
of 
transgender children who consider suicide. 
Indigo described the process of testifying 
alone as ‘‘exhausting and upsetting’’ after 
they and other transgender children were 
faced with legislators and protesters who op-
posed giving them access to gender con-
firmation care. The week after Texas consid-
ered a bill restricting public bathroom ac-
cess for transgender Texans in 2017, the 
Trevor Project reported that the amount of 
transgender children calling or messaging 
their national suicide hotline dramatically 
increased. 
Legislators voiced particular concern over 
whether these treatments may cause irre-
versible infertility for young children. Ex-
perts that lawmakers specifically invited to 
testify cited disputed statistics and stirred 
fears that procedures such as mastectomies 
could be performed on prepubescent chil-
dren—a 
claim 
Linnell 
called 
‘‘disheart-
ening,’’ given that breast tissue does not de-
velop until after puberty. 
While hormone treatments may cause in-
fertility in some cases, Linnell said it varies 
and is always discussed with patients prior 
to undergoing treatment. Surgery, she said, 
would rarely or never be used until after pu-
berty, and requires several consultations 
with doctors and psychologists before being 
approved. According to Mooney, surgery is 
only recommended when a patient is experi-
encing so much psychological distress that 
the only way to resolve it is surgery. 
While each bill would only delay treatment 
until age 18, Mooney said medical treatment 
is often necessary for transgender children 
just to make it to their 18th birthday. 
In committee testimony, 17-year-old Char-
lie Apple said the combination of gender dys-
phoria and social marginalization made him 
feel uncomfortable with both his body and 
his own existence. Receiving gender con-
firmation surgery and hormone treatment, 
he said, has helped him start to change that. 
‘‘I’ve made friends, I’ve played in sports. 
I’ve had the kind of stupid fun you’re sup-
posed to have as a kid, but most impor-
tantly, I survived,’’ Apple said. ‘‘Without 
these treatments, I would have most likely 
been with the majority of trans children not 
standing here before you, but under a grave-
stone.’’
