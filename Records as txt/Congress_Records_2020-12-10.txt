Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 2020 
No. 209 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Gracious God, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
Throughout history, You have been 
ever-present to all believers. In times 
of darkness, we readily turn on lights. 
Millions of Americans in this season 
have variously turned to the celebra-
tion of Hanukkah, the Festival of 
Lights, and the Advent and Christmas 
season with its trees and lights. 
Even so, in our political world, there 
remains the reality of considerable dis-
agreement and contention. Where there 
is darkness here, send forth a spark of 
inspiration and grace to enlighten 
minds and warm hearts to respond to 
Your love for Your people. 
Eternal Father of us all, fill Your 
children with the delight that comes 
from light. May we walk no longer in 
the darkness of distrust but join to-
gether in mutual understanding and 
peace toward the common well-being of 
our Nation. 
May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
4(a) of House Resolution 967, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Ms. 
SHERRILL) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. SHERRILL led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
PASS ANOTHER ROUND OF HELP 
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, it 
has been more than 250 days since we 
passed the CARES Act, and it is past 
time that we pass a second round. 
When this pandemic hit, despite 
being in one of the most partisan times 
in our Nation’s history, we came to-
gether in Congress to pass badly needed 
help for the American people: PPP 
loans for small businesses; State and 
local funding to help with contact trac-
ing, testing, and grants to those in 
need. 
We passed an eviction moratorium so 
people could stay in their homes and 
nutrition aid for the millions of fami-
lies who suddenly are experiencing food 
insecurity. 
Now that we have good news about 
vaccines, now that we have hope for 
the future, we have to pass another 
round of help so businesses can make it 
through the winter, children can have 
access to food, families can stay in 
their homes, and kids can get back to 
school. 
There is a bipartisan deal that the 
Senate and House Members are on 
board with, a deal that would provide 
relief to millions. 
Let’s once again show the American 
people that we are there for them when 
it counts. 
f 
HONORING THE CAREER OF LISA 
PITTMAN 
(Mr. BISHOP of Utah asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, I called Lisa Pittman, who 
is the counsel for our committee, to 
make sure we had somebody covering 
us for floor time. 
She chastised me then, saying that 
under my condition, I need to ask 
about calling a doctor first, not calling 
a lawyer. 
No, Lisa, we call you not just for 
legal advice but for all sorts of things. 
For 38 years, she has been a true public 
servant, with 33 consecutive years here 
in the House where she has served with 
poise under pressure and always brings 
an air of stability. 
We ask opinions of a lot of people, 
but we always double-check by going 
to Lisa because she understands it all. 
She served under 17 Republican lead-
ers in Natural Resources. I still think I 
am her favorite one—trust me. But 
even yesterday, she still told my chief 
of staff that she gets choked up when 
she looks at the Capitol dome or hears 
the Pledge of Allegiance. It is still 
magical to her. 
As our committee mom, when she 
brings cupcakes to everyone on their 
birthdays and special occasions, her 
kindness is magic to the rest of us. 
So, when I leave at the end of the 
month, no one is really going to care. 
When Lisa leaves at the end of the 
month, it is going to take decades to 
replace the institutional knowledge 
that she brings to this place. 
Lisa, we thank you. And, Mr. Speak-
er, I appreciate your indulgence. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF SENATOR 
PAUL SARBANES 
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I join 
Members of the Maryland delegation in 
praising a great man, Paul Sarbanes. 
The people of Maryland and all 
Americans have lost a leader and a 
public servant of dignity and principle, 
Senator Paul Sarbanes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7114 
December 10, 2020 
His 40 years of tireless service as a 
member of the Maryland House of Del-
egates, the House of Representatives, 
and the U.S. Senate strengthened our 
Nation and made a difference in the 
lives of countless Americans. 
In Congress, Paul Sarbanes was re-
spected by his colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle for his humility, tenacity, 
and brilliant intellect. 
It was a source of great pride for me 
that his congressional career began in 
the same House seat which was held by 
my father years before. 
All Marylanders can take pride in 
Paul Sarbanes’ leadership as a defender 
of our American democracy on the Ju-
diciary Committee and his tireless 
work to bring integrity, transparency, 
and oversight to Washington as chair 
of the Banking Committee. 
May it be a comfort to Senator Sar-
banes’ children, Michael, Janet, and 
our colleague, Congressman JOHN SAR-
BANES, and the entire Sarbanes family 
that Senator Sarbanes, Paul, is with 
his beautiful wife, Christine. They are 
together in Heaven. 
May it be of comfort that so many 
mourn their loss and are praying for 
them at this sad time.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLES 
‘‘CHUCKIE’’ DABELLA, JR. 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life of Charles DaBella, Jr., known to 
his family and friends as Chuckie. 
Chuckie was a resident of Hastings, 
Cambria 
County, 
Pennsylvania. 
He 
passed away at the age of 52 this sum-
mer on June 29 after a devastating mo-
torcycle accident. 
Chuckie’s 
sister, 
Charlene, 
said: 
‘‘Chuck was an amazing soldier, broth-
er, father, and son.’’ 
His military legacy is one that he 
and his family can certainly and for-
ever be proud of. Chuckie was a retired 
Army infantryman with 13 years of 
service. He was with the 3rd Special 
Forces Group, a Green Beret, senior 
parachutist, and Army range qualified, 
earning the bronze German Armed 
Forces Badge of Marksmanship. 
Chuckie was also the recipient of 
four Purple Hearts and the Bronze 
Star. 
The pain that comes from the loss of 
a loved one never truly fades, but I 
want the DaBella family to know that 
they are in my thoughts, and my pray-
ers are with them during this incred-
ibly difficult time. We are proud of the 
service and legacy that Chuckie has 
left. 
May God watch over Chuck, who left 
us far too soon.

SOUTHERN 
CHRISTIAN 
LEADERSHIP 
CONFERENCE 
BUILDING A NATIONAL HISTORIC 
SITE 
(Mr. HALL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak a truth, and that truth is 
quite simple. I stand on the shoulders 
of giants. 
I hail from Atlanta, which is the 
home of the King Center, a place dedi-
cated to the memory of Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., one of America’s great-
est citizens. We honor him with a Fed-
eral holiday and memorial on our Na-
tional Mall, just outside of this Cham-
ber. 
I am also the heir to the seat held by 
the late, great John Lewis. Congress-
man Lewis was by Dr. King’s side, and 
Congressman Lewis dedicated his life 
to peaceful nonviolence. 
Congressman Lewis was a beacon in 
this Chamber for the dozens of years 
that he served. It is one of the greatest 
honors of my life to be able to com-
plete the term for which he was last 
elected and take the baton and bring 
his service across the finish line. 
But I would be remiss if I did not use 
this opportunity to make sure their 
lessons are known for generations to 
come. 
That is why it is critical that we 
make sure we preserve the buildings in 
metro Atlanta that give life to their 
work. We must establish the former 
headquarters of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, where Dr. King 
did his work alongside Congressman 
Lewis, as a National Historic Site. 
If we do this, we can do our small 
part to ensure that those who follow in 
our footsteps do so mindful of the ex-
ample of these giants of the civil rights 
movement. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JIMMY 
ORR 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
Mr. Jimmy Orr of Brunswick, Georgia, 
who recently passed away after a long 
and impactful life. 
Jimmy was a gifted athlete who ex-
celled in basketball, baseball, and foot-
ball in high school and went on to at-
tend Clemson University on a basket-
ball scholarship. 
He later transferred to the Univer-
sity of Georgia to become one of the 
Wally Boys, which was a term used for 
those who played under football Head 
Coach Wally Butts. 
During his junior year at the Univer-
sity of Georgia, Jimmy was initially 
drafted by the Los Angeles Rams and 
was later traded to the Pittsburgh 
Steelers after graduation. 
His exceptional performance made 
him an easy choice for United Press 
International 
and 
Associated 
Press 
Rookie of the Year in 1958. 
After Jimmy’s outstanding 13-year 
career with the NFL, he eventually led 
several successful business ventures be-
fore retiring to the Georgia coast, 
where he held a successful golfing 
record. 
He was not only an amazing athlete; 
he was a loving father and husband, a 
wonderful friend, and a generous phi-
lanthropist who impacted the lives of 
countless individuals. 
I am thankful for Jimmy’s many 
years of representing Brunswick well, 
and I know his legacy will continue for 
many years to come. 
f 
EDUCATE PEOPLE ON BENEFITS 
OF VITAMIN D 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
spoken on vitamin D a bit in the past, 
and I know we are on the verge of pass-
ing another coronavirus bill. 
I would ask people negotiating that 
bill to do something to make sure that 
the public is aware of the benefits of vi-
tamin D. 
Yesterday, I talked to a Dr. David 
Meltzer at the University of Chicago, a 
very brilliant man, and I hope some of 
the negotiators talk to him before a 
final deal is cut. 
While he cannot nail down a specific 
amount of people who will not have to 
suffer the severe consequences of vita-
min D deficiency, or even die at the 
hands of vitamin D, it is probably 
somewhere between 40 and 70 percent. 
Right now, about half of Americans 
have a vitamin D deficiency. That is 
going to get worse as we head into the 
winter months and people are not out-
side getting vitamin D. 
So, I strongly request the negotiators 
to do something to make sure that we 
stand up to the public health establish-
ment and educate people on the impor-
tance of vitamin D and see what we can 
do about getting products to the mar-
ket which accelerate getting vitamin D 
into your bloodstream, because even if 
you start taking vitamin D tomorrow, 
you don’t get the level that you should 
have for quite a while. 
I am encouraging the negotiators to 
talk to Dr. David Meltzer, who will 
also fill you in on studies from Ireland, 
Spain, 
MIT, 
Harvard, 
and 
North-
western.

warrior, a hard worker, an Air Force 
lieutenant colonel, and—perhaps her 
most important job—a mother of five. 
Her name is Amanda Naylor, and she 
has been part of my office for her year-
long Defense fellowship. 
Amanda took the hustle and bustle of 
Capitol Hill in stride. She made it look 
easy. She hit the ground running, and 
whether it was committee hearings, 
briefings with Defense Department of-
ficials, or working with other offices, 
Amanda was always there to provide 
our team expertise and drive issues for-
ward. 
She used her own experience in the 
military and the Air Force to craft leg-
islation like the Rent the Camo Act 
that provided affordable maternity uni-
forms for our servicewomen. It is truly 
a testament to her insight and her hard 
work that she got this bill into the 
NDAA, into the defense bill. She is a 
perfect example of why we need more 
veterans in Congress and more vet-
erans in government at every level. 
They bring that on-the-ground exper-
tise into our legislation. 
Amanda is talented, smart, and, 
above all, kind. Congress could cer-
tainly use more like her. I am sad she 
will be leaving us, but she has made 
our office and she will make the coun-
try a better and safer place.

DRIFTNET MODERNIZATION AND 
BYCATCH REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move

California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California (Mr. HUFFMAN). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN)? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to 
speak in favor of the Driftnet Mod-
ernization and Bycatch Reduction Act. 
This was sent to us by the Senate on 
voice vote and sponsored by California 
Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 
I applaud our colleagues in the Sen-
ate for sending us meaningful bipar-
tisan bills—for a change—that were 
overwhelmingly improved. I hope my 
colleagues in the House will join me in 
this bipartisan effort to conserve our 
oceans and wildlife. 
I would also like to applaud the rec-
reational 
fishing 
and 
conservation 
community for their leadership on this 
bill. 
Large-scale 
drift 
gillnets—or 
driftnets, 
as 
they 
are 
called—are 
wasteful, and they are an outdated 
type of fishing gear. At 2 kilometers 
long, their purpose is to simply drift 
along through ocean currents and 
catch whatever they may find in their 
long webbing. 
The only large-scale driftnet fishery 
in the country today is the West Coast 
swordfish fishery, where these driftnets 
are used to catch swordfish and other 
commercially valuable species such as 
thresher, mako shark, and opah. 
But a 2-kilometer-long net in the 
ocean catches far more than these tar-
get species. Driftnets are indiscrimi-
nate. 
They 
catch 
sea 
turtles, 
bottlenose dolphins, and short-finned 
pilot whales. 
During the committee hearing on 
this bill, my Republican colleague, 
GARRET GRAVES, joked that California 
is finally catching up with his State of 
Louisiana because they ended driftnet 
fishing in 1995, to which I say: Good for 
Louisiana. Elsewhere around the world,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7116 
December 10, 2020 
driftnets have been banned due to the 
high rate of bycatch. 
This 
important 
legislation 
would 
amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act to 
direct the Secretary of Commerce to 
conduct a transition program to phase 
out 
the 
use 
of 
these 
large-scale 
driftnets and to facilitate the adoption 
of alternative fishing gear. 
This transition program is supported 
by key stakeholders. A majority of ac-
tive permit holders submitted their in-
tent to participate in the program, and 
a nonprofit has invested $1 million to 
help these fishermen transition. 
It is important to note that there 
really are great alternatives to drift 
gillnets, like deep-set buoys, which 
have a lower bycatch rate and can ac-
tually fetch higher market rates for 
fishermen. 
This bill would also prohibit the use 
of large-scale driftnet fishing by all 
U.S. vessels within the U.S. exclusive 
economic zone within 5 years. 
Let’s join the rest of the world and 
end the use of drift gillnets. The Sen-
ate passed this bill in July, and I urge 
my colleagues in the House to do the 
same now. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, we have before us today 
a bill that will very effectively put 
most swordfish boats on the West 
Coast out of business. I believe it is yet 
another battle on a multifront war by 
the far-left Democrats against Amer-
ica’s working class. 
The swordfish boats on the West 
Coast harvest a Pacific fishery that the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration has classified as ‘‘under-
utilized.’’ There is no shortage of 
swordfish thanks to the responsible 
management of this fishery under the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conserva-
tion and Management Act. 
The principal means of harvesting 
swordfish is the drift gillnet, which has 
been a target of environmental extrem-
ists for years. Despite their lurid tales 
of indiscriminate catches of other spe-
cies, particularly endangered species, 
this is, in fact, a very rare occurrence. 
With respect to endangered species, 
the National Marine Fisheries Service 
reported: ‘‘It is NMFS’ biological opin-
ion that the proposed action of contin-
ued management of the drift gillnet 
fishery is not likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of these seven en-
dangered species and is not likely to 
destroy or adversely modify any ESA- 
listed designated critical habitat.’’ 
So here we have an industry that 
some of the hardest working men and 
women in America depend upon to feed 
their families—and, by the way, feed 
ours, as well—in an underutilized fish-
ery by means of drift gillnets that have 
an extremely low incidence of inad-
vertent bycatch. 
So what does Congress propose to do 
for these families? Commend them for 
their hard work? Thank them for the 
contribution they make to America’s 
food supply and to the American econ-
omy? Well, no, not exactly. Instead, 
Congress proposes to shut them down. 
Those aren’t my words. When Gary 
Burke, one of the swordfishermen 
threatened by this bill came before our 
subcommittee, he said: ‘‘I want to be 
very clear regarding the impacts of 
this legislation on the driftnet gill 
fleet. It will shut us down.’’ 
And for what possible reason? 
The fishery is sound; the industry is 
responsible; incidental takes are ex-
tremely rare. Why would anyone want 
to decimate these families and Amer-
ican consumers as well? Just for the 
hell of it seems to be the only logical 
explanation. 
The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Con-
servation and Management Act has 
been lauded by conservationists for 
many decades. It has stood the test of 
time and proven itself to be a program 
that works. 
The Regional Fishery Management 
Council process works because it is col-
laborative, and it involves the parties 
with a direct stake in keeping the fish-
ery healthy. 
This legislation is a ham-handed, 
iron-fisted, top-down diktat that goes 
against everything that Magnuson-Ste-
vens stands for. 
Now, we just heard: Don’t worry. 
There is an alternative that will work 
just fine. It is the deep-set buoy gear. 
And, yes, it is sometimes used to sup-
plement the drift gillnets, but it is not 
economically viable by itself. 
As the actual swordfishermen ex-
plained, the costs of running a fishing 
vessel—fuel, debt service, and labor— 
often means a very tight profit margin. 
To make a trip viable, the boat must 
achieve enough of a catch to at least 
offset its costs. 
The alternative this bill would force 
on them simply doesn’t catch nearly as 
many fish and certainly not enough to 
make the trip profitable. Reduce the 
catch below the break-even mark—as 
this bill surely does—and there is no 
catch because the boat can’t go out. 
How do we know that? Because the 
very fishermen who use the deep-set 
buoy gear have told us so. They state 
in a letter to the committee: ‘‘Our con-
cern is based on the fact that while 
there is potential for alternative gear 
to be used in this industry, currently 
there is no existing gear that can be 
substituted for the drift gillnet and 
still allow fishermen to earn a living.’’ 
Those are the people who use that 
equipment. 
So let me repeat that: Our fishermen 
will not be able to earn a living using 
this experimental gear. The majority 
knows this; it is just they don’t care. 
This legislation does nothing to im-
prove fisheries management but, in-
stead, does great harm in two respects: 
It takes away the earnings of American 
fishermen, and it raises the price of 
seafood for American families. 
Again, don’t take my word for it, or 
even the fishermen whose livelihoods 
are being cast aside. The Natural Re-
sources Committee received testimony 
from NOAA which stressed to our 
members that this bill ‘‘does not re-
flect the progress made to date in 
minimizing bycatch in the U.S. West 
Coast drift gillnet fishery. Based on the 
best available science and 26 years of 
observer data, bycatch of threatened or 
endangered protected species is a rare 
event.’’ 
Now let’s talk about the unintended 
consequences of putting the American 
West Coast swordfish industry out of 
business. 
It doesn’t protect the fishery because 
the fishery isn’t endangered. It doesn’t 
protect other species because inci-
dental taking of those species is rare. 
The ultimate irony is that this bill 
doesn’t even stop the use of drift 
gillnets except, of course, for Ameri-
cans. This bill will effectively remove 
West Coast swordfish from the market, 
but it doesn’t remove the market de-
mand. 
So what happens? Consumer prices 
will go up and the market will meet 
that demand by shifting to swordfish 
caught by foreign fleets where they are 
not strictly regulated and where they 
will enjoy an enormous competitive ad-
vantage by being unrestricted in their 
use of the very same drift gillnets that 
Americans—and only Americans—are 
forbidden from using. 
Again, that is not my conclusion. 
That is the conclusion of NOAA itself, 
which told our committee: ‘‘NOAA is 
concerned that shifting to alternative 
gears that are not economically viable 
could decrease U.S. swordfish harvest 
and reduce the U.S. West Coast large 
mesh drift gillnet fishery’s competi-
tiveness against foreign fisheries with 
less restrictive environmental regula-
tions during the phaseout.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this 
cruel and ill-conceived measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, for 
those folks who had the word ‘‘diktat’’ 
on their bingo card, you are a big win-
ner today. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
league for that, but when he describes 
this bill as extreme, overreaching, and 
draconian, he left out the fact that 28 
of the 31 fishermen in this particular 
fishery have already agreed to partici-
pate in the transition program that 
this bill provides. My hope is that the 
three holdouts will take advantage of 
the transition assistance being offered 
and join the rest of their peers. 
Also, when my colleague mentions 
far-left Democrats driving this bill, he 
forgets to mention the long list of Re-
publicans in both the House and Senate 
who are supporting this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE). 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, as the Rep-
resentative of the State with one of the 
largest exclusive economic zones in our 
country and as the Representative of

overfishing, including the use of these 
techniques throughout our Pacific, I 
rise in very strong support of the 
Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch 
Reduction Act. This bipartisan legisla-
tion is necessary to transition fairly an 
important West Coast fishery away 
from the use of large mesh driftnets. 
I want to commend, in addition to 
Senator FEINSTEIN and the Republican 
cosponsors, Congressman LIEU on our 
side for his work on the bill in the 
House. 
Yes, this fishery is small, with less 
than 20 participants, but it is one of 
the most destructive. The use of mile- 
long driftnets results in over 70 species 
caught in volume as bycatch. 
The problems with this practice are 
nothing new. Beginning in the 1980s, 
Congress and the Republican and first 
Bush administration recognized its de-
struction and worked together to re-
form the practice, culminating with 
the near complete global moratorium 
on the practice. 
Today, the large mesh driftnets that 
continue to be used in Federal waters 
along the West Coast are the last of 
their kind in the Nation. This bill 
closes that loophole and phases out the 
practice. 
b 0930 
Fortunately, new fishing technology 
has been developed that catches sword-
fish at a profitable level without the 
huge levels of bycatch associated with 
driftnets. That is good for fishermen, 
good for consumers, and good for the 
marine environment. 
All West Coast States have already 
acted to prohibit this type of fishing 
from their shores and their oceans. It 
is time we, at the Federal level, act to 
do the same to ensure the sustain-
ability of this fishery and the sustain-
ability 
of 
the 
bycatch 
fisheries. 
Transitioning away from large-mesh 
driftnets is supported by recreational 
fishermen, conservation groups, sea-
food purveyors, and consumers, and it 
just makes sense. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
bipartisan, bicameral bill. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no other speakers, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a letter from the 
California fishermen who participated 
in the experimental technology dem-
onstration 
project 
expressing 
their 
concerns with the bill. 
MAY 6, 2019. 
Re: H.R. 1979—Driftnet Modernization and 
Bycatch Reduction Act 
Hon. TED LIEU, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN LIEU: We are partici-
pants in the experimental Deep-Set Buoy 
Gear (‘‘DSBG’’) fishery off the California 
Coast. A majority of us participate in, or 
have participated in, the drift gillnet fish-
ery. We are writing to express our concerns 
regarding H.R. 1979, the Driftnet Moderniza-
tion and Bycatch Reduction Act. H.R. 1979 
includes language which will phase-out the 
use of drift gillnets (‘‘DGN’’) to harvest 
swordfish and require the ‘‘. . . adoption of 
alternative fishing practices that minimize 
the incidental catch of living marine re-
sources’’. Our concern is based on the fact 
that while there is potential for alternative 
gear to be used in this fishery, currently 
there is no existing gear that can be sub-
stituted for the DGN gear and still allow 
fishermen to earn a living. 
The Pacific Fishery Management Council 
(‘‘PFMC’’) is currently working towards au-
thorizing Deep-Set Buoy Gear (‘‘DSBG’’), a 
swordfish gear type that was developed to 
provide west coast fishers with an additional 
gear option for use during periods of reduced 
landings. DSBG has been allowed to operate 
under an Exempted Fishing Permit (‘‘EFP’’) 
since 2015. As noted in the initial EFP appli-
cation DSBG was designed to ‘‘. . . provide 
fishers with a complementary gear type that 
can be used in conjunction with harpooning 
. . . . and also compliment ongoing DGN ac-
tivities.’’ 
Participants in the initial EFP had exten-
sive experience targeting swordfish with 
DGN and harpoon gears and participated in 
the research trials so that they could expand 
domestic fishery options for the West Coast. 
This continues to be a priority for managers 
and the fishing community, as current re-
strictions limit summertime harvest off 
California waters, forcing markets to import 
swordfish even when the resource is avail-
able in local waters. The coupling of DSBG, 
harpoon and DGN techniques provides the 
tools needed to capitalize on this federal re-
source throughout the entire fishery season. 
This is critical given that different gear 
types have different seasons in which they 
work optimally. 
Because 
DSBG 
landings 
peak 
in 
the 
months prior to that of the DGN fishery, our 
community has largely supported the advent 
and trial of new techniques, as they have the 
potential to augment and revitalize our de-
clining fishery. Now that H.R. 1979 proposes 
to phase out DGN and replace it with DSBG, 
we are concerned that this will further im-
pact the viability of west coast swordfish op-
erations all together. We are certain that the 
DGN market share will be filled with addi-
tional unregulated foreign-caught swordfish. 
As shown in 2018, increases in unregulated 
imports drives market price down, reduces 
domestic profitability and deters participa-
tion our US fisheries. Collectively, we feel 
that H.R. 1979 will negatively impact local 
livelihoods, increase our reliance upon for-
eign fleets and decrease the productivity and 
of our west coast fishery. 
We are also concerned over the proposed 
transition of the traditional DGN fleet to a 
future DSBG fishery. Some of the DGN ves-
sels are larger than those currently used in 
the DSBG fishery and many of them only 
fish for swordfish during the fall window in 
which DGN works optimally. We are trou-
bled that the proposed transition will create 
an inequity among the fleet and negatively 
impact fishing operations and profitability. 
We feel that H.R. 1979 is premature and 
should be contemplated only after it is dem-
onstrated that DSBG can be profitable for 
the entire DGN community. Until then, we 
hope to continue to provide domestic west 
coast swordfish caught using highly regu-
lated techniques that continue to operate in 
full federal and state compliance.

Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I implore the majority 
to consider the damage that it will do 
with this bill. The West Coast sword-
fish fishery is healthy and, indeed, un-
derutilized. The drift gillnet results in 
very little incidental take of other spe-
cies. To put a number on it, in 17 years, 
only 10 whales interacted with these 
nets, and 4 of them were released alive. 
Six of them were killed. 
Now, to put that in perspective—6 in 
17 years—roughly 80 whales are killed 
by ships off the California coast every 
year. Six were killed by driftnets in 17 
years; 80 are killed by ship collisions 
every year. 
Does my friend see the difference? 
Banning the nets will reduce the 
catch below the level that is economi-
cally viable. It will shut down the in-
dustry. The result will be devastating 
to the families that run these busi-
nesses. It will be harmful to the con-
sumer who will pay higher prices for 
this product, and it will encourage in-
creased use of driftnets in foreign 
waters to fill the shortage caused by 
banning them in our own. 
Why in God’s name would anyone 
want to do that? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has 
raised the issue of foreign fleets using 
these drift gillnets a couple of times 
now. Let me briefly speak to that, and 
I will close. 
Of course, we need to do something 
about those bad practices by foreign 
fleets, but in order to do that, in order 
to restrict the importation of seafood 
that is caught through unsustainable 
practices by foreign fleets, we have to 
hold our own fleets to this higher 
standard of sustainability and bycatch 
reduction. That is what this bill and 
other efforts in this area are all about. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a solidly bipar-
tisan bill. I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Driftnet Moderniza-
tion and Bycatch Reduction Act, bipartisan, bi-
cameral legislation that would phase out the 
use of large mesh drift gillnets off the coast of 
California. 
Currently, the use of gillnets with a total 
length of two and one-half kilometers or more 
is prohibited in U.S. waters. However, off the 
coast of California, we have seen that drift 
gillnet fishing gear within the legal federal limit 
is still having an adverse impact on our Pacific 
wildlife. While these mile-long gillnets are de-
signed to catch swordfish and thresher sharks, 
the large mesh net frequently captures many 
other marine animals as bycatch, injuring or 
killing them in the process. 
The practice of drift gillnet fishing is an anti-
quated method for catching swordfish and

thresher sharks, and is already banned in 
many states, including Washington and Or-
egon. It is time to adopt new fishing tech-
nology in order to set a path toward more sus-
tainable fishing. This bill would direct the Sec-
retary of Commerce to conduct a transition 
program to phase-out large mesh drift gillnet 
and promote the adoption of alternative fishing 
practices to minimize the bycatch of marine 
species. 
Bycatch is a lingering problem in fisheries 
management, and such waste is especially 
pervasive in driftnet fisheries. We have the 
prime opportunity today to provide a solution 
that would improve fishery resource manage-
ment and provide the swordfish fishery partici-
pants the needed support to transition to more 
selective and sustainable fishing gear. It is a 
win-win situation. 
On July 22, 2020, the Senate passed S. 
906 by unanimous consent. There is broad 
support for this legislation, including endorse-
ments from the American Sportfishing Asso-
ciation, The Pew Charitable Trusts, Humane 
Society Legislative Fund, Oceana, Theodore 
Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, and the 
National Marine Manufacturers Association. In 
the spirit of bipartisanship, I urge my col-
leagues in the House to join us in passing this 
commonsense legislation today. I would like to 
thank 
Chairman 
GRIJALVA, 
Congressman 
HUFFMAN, and Senator FEINSTEIN
for their 
leadership on this issue as well as House and 
Senate committee staff for their hard work. I 
look forward to the enactment of this bill. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of S. 906, the Driftnet Modernization 
and Bycatch Reduction Act. I would like to 
start out by thanking Senators LISA MUR-
KOWSKI, DAN SULLIVAN, DIANNE FEINSTEIN, and 
SHELLEY CAPITO, along with Congressman TED 
LIEU, and everyone who was involved in this 
legislation. Their passion for our fisheries is 
truly admirable. 
This bill includes a Recreational Quota Enti-
ty (RQE) provision that is crucial to the charter 
fishing industry. Under the provision, an RQE 
would be allowed to purchase and hold a lim-
ited amount of halibut quota shares to aug-
ment the amount of halibut available to char-
ters. For years, charter anglers have faced 
stringent restrictions as catch limits have been 
reduced and this provision would allow fishing 
charters to compete on a larger scale. 
Charter fishing in Alaska is world renown 
and is a driving force for tourism in many 
towns. I was fortunate enough to have the op-
portunity to spend a day in Seward this past 
summer meeting with halibut charters and 
hearing directly from the people in the indus-
try. I’d also note we had a great time catching 
some Alaska fish. 
While this bill may not be perfect, I urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting this bipar-
tisan legislation because of the importance of 
the RQE provision to my home state of Alas-
ka. This is a self-funding solution that will have 
a positive impact for the charter fishing indus-
try. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 906. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

ant to section 3 of House Resolution

ROBERT E. LEE STATUE REMOVAL 
ACT 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 970) to direct the Secretary of the 
Interior to develop a plan for the re-
moval of the monument to Robert E. 
Lee at the Antietam National Battle-
field, and for other purposes, as amend-
ed. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 970 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Robert E. Lee 
Statue Removal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL OF MONUMENT. 
Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Inte-
rior, acting through the Director of the National 
Park Service, shall remove and appropriately 
dispose of the Monument to General Robert E. 
Lee at the Antietam National Battlefield. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material in the mat-
ter under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 970 introduced by my friend, 
Representative BROWN of Maryland, a 
member of the Committee on Natural 
Resources and vice chair of the House 
Committee on Armed Services. 
Mr. BROWN’s bill directs the National 
Park Service to remove a statue of 
Robert E. Lee from the Antietam Na-
tional Battlefield in Maryland. This 24- 
foot statue of General Lee was dedi-
cated in 2003, 138 years after the end of 
the Civil War. It was commissioned and 
placed by a private citizen on private 
land that the National Park Service 
later acquired in 2005. 
As our Nation continues to wrestle 
and reckon with racial inequality and 
injustice, it is past time that we take 
stock of these symbols that we display 
and the stories that we tell about our 
past, present, and future. 
For example, the statue at issue here 
is not historically accurate and it sim-
ply serves to glorify the ‘‘Lost Cause’’ 
narrative. It does not belong on a na-
tional battlefield. 
I thank Representative BROWN for his 
hard work in bringing attention to this 
issue, and I urge swift passage of this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to fill in for the ranking member 
of the full committee, Representative 
BISHOP. He was here briefly earlier, but 
he is definitely under the weather. 
Mr. Speaker, on this bill, I simply 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
as much time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
BROWN). 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman from Cali-
fornia, my good friend, Mr. HUFFMAN, 
for yielding time. I also thank Chair-
man GRIJALVA and the staff on the 
Committee on Natural Resources for 
their work and partnership on H.R. 970, 
the Robert E. Lee Statue Removal Act. 
Mr. Speaker, my bill, which I first in-
troduced last Congress, would remove 
the statue of Confederate General Rob-
ert E. Lee from Antietam National 
Battlefield in Sharpsburg, Maryland. 
Antietam was the site of immense 
bloodshed during the Civil War. 
After 12 hours of combat, 23,000 Union 
and Confederate soldiers were killed, 
wounded, or missing. It remains the 
bloodiest day in American history, and 
thousands come every year to learn 
about the war over slavery that almost 
divided our Union. 
On this Federal land stands a 24-foot 
statue of General Lee. It was commis-
sioned with the explicit intent of hon-
oring the Confederacy and glorifies the 
Confederacy, its leaders, the cause of 
slavery, and open rebellion against the 
United States of America. 
The Lee statue was built by a private 
citizen in 2003—as you heard, 138 years 
after the end of the Civil War—and 
later acquired by the National Park 
Service. It is also historically inac-
curate. 
The monument depicts General Lee 
riding to the battlefield on horseback, 
but the evidence shows the General ac-
tually traveled to a different part of a 
battlefield in an ambulance due to a 
broken wrist. 
The monument claims that Lee was 
‘‘personally against secession and slav-
ery.’’ Yet Lee was a brutal slave owner. 
He fought for the Confederacy and de-
fended the savage institution of slav-
ery, and he led an army that kidnapped 
free African Americans and massacred 
surrendering Black Union soldiers. 
Instead of teaching us the dark les-
sons of our history, this statue sani-
tizes the actions of men who fought a 
war 
to 
keep 
Black 
Americans 
in 
chains. This is just one monument, 
among many. 
Throughout our history, monuments 
to the Confederacy have been used to

rally white supremacists and intimi-
date Black Americans. The majority of 
these monuments were built post-Re-
construction by Confederate apolo-
gists, segregationists, and opponents of 
civil rights. 
We next saw a resurgence of statues 
honoring the Confederacy during the 
1960s and 1970s, when white suprema-
cists 
attempted 
to 
roll 
back 
the 
progress being made during the civil 
rights movement. As monuments went 
up, Black men, women, and children 
were being lynched. 
Confederate monuments served as a 
reminder of the power that white su-
premacists attempted to yield and as-
sert over Black Americans. Earlier this 
week, the House voted to remove the 
names from military bases and prop-
erty that honor the Confederacy. We 
should take the same steps for statues 
honoring the Confederacy in our na-
tional public spaces. 
Reckoning with our shared history 
and 
this 
country’s 
past 
injustices 
doesn’t dishonor the Nation; it makes 
it stronger. There are appropriate set-
tings—museums, libraries, and class-
rooms—to teach future generations of 
the insidious effort to defend the vio-
lent institution of slavery. But there is 
no reason why any of our Nation’s pub-
lic spaces should have monuments that 
celebrate those who betrayed their 
country. 
There is only one side in the Civil 
War we should be honoring, and that is 
of the United States. And we should 
celebrate figures who fought to pre-
serve our Union and those who helped 
rebuild our Nation after the Civil 
War—the men and women who marched 
and protested and died for this country 
to live up to our founding ideals. 
Removing the monument at Antie-
tam and those across our country is 
not an insult to any State or region. It 
would simply be acknowledgment that 
the cause the Confederacy fought for— 
the cause of slavery—was wrong, that 
Jim Crow and violent resistance of 
civil rights for all people is wrong. 
It is long past time for the Robert E. 
Lee statue on Antietam Battlefield to 
come down, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this bill. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, before I 
reserve after those beautiful remarks, I 
include in the RECORD an email from 
the CBO.

DAVID HUGHES, 
Analyst, Congressional Budget Office. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, we 
were unable to get an official score, but 
this email confirms on a preliminary 
basis that all of the remaining bills 
have no spending effect. They also have 
no revenue effect, with the exception of 
H.R. 7489, which has a net revenue de-
crease. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
RASKIN). 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of H.R. 
970, and I salute my colleague, Con-
gressman BROWN, for his exemplary 
leadership on this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I cannot find a single 
case of any other country on Earth 
where monuments and memorials are 
put up to honor the generals of enemy 
forces in a civil war or any other war. 
Maybe another such case exists, but I 
can’t find it. And there is no denying 
that there is something freakishly un-
usual about this practice, but you can-
not blame Americans from the 19th 
century. In this case, you can’t even 
blame Americans from the 20th cen-
tury. 
This statue of Robert E. Lee went up 
in 2003, not even 2 decades ago. The bi-
zarre and stubborn impulse to honor 
Confederate military traitors to the 
Union on the very battlefield where 
they fought to destroy our Union and 
to kill our soldiers waving the Union 
flag reflects the hold of the so-called 
‘‘Lost Cause’’ ideology, the myth which 
returns in times of resurgent racism, 
that the Confederate cause was heroic 
and noble, that slavery was a benevo-
lent institution, and that treason was 
somehow justified. 
This kind of derangement from re-
ality and from American constitu-
tionalism has set the pattern for a 
paranoid style in American politics, 
which continues to this very day. 
Mr. Speaker, in 2020, we have a Presi-
dent of the United States who refuses 
to accept his defeat in the election by 
more than 7 million votes and by a 
margin of 306–232 in the Electoral Col-
lege—a margin he declared ‘‘a land-
slide’’ when he won by that very same 
amount. 
A big defender of the Confederate 
statues, the President from New York 
is busily constructing a new romantic 
‘‘Lost Cause’’ mythology about his 
loss, despite the fact that more than 40 
courts have rejected all of his claims 
about the election. 
Mr. Speaker, let us put an end to this 
strange practice of honoring the mili-
tary enemies of the United States. Let 
us put an end to the ‘‘Lost Cause’’ my-
thology, which has been such an ab-
scess and such a danger to the Repub-
lic. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I sim-
ply thank my colleagues from Mary-
land for the eloquence and moral clar-
ity they have brought to this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this long overdue and 
much-needed legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 970, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill comes to us 
from Congressman DON YOUNG, but it is 
called the Young Fisherman Develop-
ment Act because it is all about fos-
tering the business skills and develop-
ment of young people in this industry. 
It is one of many reasons why I am 
proud to support this bill, which passed 
out of the Natural Resources Com-
mittee by unanimous consent. 
I am grateful to our colleague from 
Alaska for sponsoring it. This bipar-
tisan bill to assist fishing communities 
builds on the example of bipartisan 
ocean bills that we have passed in the 
House these past few weeks, including 
the Sea Grant reauthorization. I am 
proud to have led that effort and look 
forward to seeing it signed into law 
soon. 
It is difficult for many young men 
and women to get started in the com-
mercial fishing industry these days. 
That was the case even before the pan-
demic. Entry-level positions are chal-
lenging to find. For those who are at-
tempting to start up on their own, 
there are staggering obstacles to over-
come: boats, licenses, docking fees, and 
numerous other expenses that pose a 
high cost of entry and lots of financial 
risks. 
To compound all of these difficulties, 
we have the pandemic, which has 
forced so many restaurants to close, 
upending the entire distribution sys-
tem for seafood, severely impacting the 
industry and further straining young 
fishermen and -women. 
Like Congressman YOUNG, I represent 
many fishing communities. I have 
heard firsthand from those in my dis-
trict and across the country about the 
barriers the young entrants face when 
starting off in the commercial fishing 
industry. Supporting this new genera-
tion will help ensure that our country’s 
rich 
coastal 
heritage 
and 
seafood 
economies continue to thrive. 
This bill fosters a new generation in 
the American commercial fishing in-
dustry, doing several things by cre-
ating 
a 
national 
grant 
program 
through NOAA Sea Grant to support 
training, education, and workforce de-
velopment. Under this program, uni-
versities, fishing associations, Tribes, 
and others can compete for grant fund-
ing. They can use those funds to train 
young 
commercial 
fishermen 
and 
-women in business practices and sus-
tainable fishing. 
This program will help teach skills in 
navigation; electronics; vessel and en-
gine care; technology and engineering 
related to conservation fishing gear; di-
rect marketing, supply chain, and 
traceability; financial and risk man-
agement; and much more. 
It is a very important bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Representative HUFFMAN, for his sup-
port of this bill. He made some great 
points in favor of it, and I acknowledge 
and appreciate that. 
I commend Congressman DON YOUNG 
from Alaska for his tireless commit-
ment to our fishermen. DON YOUNG is 
the dean of the House, having served 
longer than any other of the 435 Mem-
bers of Congress. 
Research funded by Alaska Sea Grant 
found that the average age of Alaskan 
fishers was over 50 years old, an in-
crease of more than 10 years over the 
past generation. 
Young commercial fishermen are fac-
ing increasing challenges, such as bar-
riers to entry and limited training op-
portunities, not to mention that U.S. 
fisheries are among the most highly 
regulated, 
monitored, 
and 
enforced 
fisheries in the world. 
While NOAA has stated it has exist-
ing programs that address some of 
these concerns, no one program is dedi-
cated to training, educating, and as-
sisting the next generation of commer-
cial fishermen. This bill addresses that 
deficiency. 
Again, I thank Congressman YOUNG 
for his leadership on these issues. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
measure, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of H.R. 1240, the Young Fishermen’s 
Development Act. I would like to start off by 
thanking Senator LISA MURKOWSKI, and DAN 
SULLIVAN, 
along 
with 
Congresswoman 
RADEWAGEN, Congressman MOULTON, and ev-
eryone else who was involved in this legisla-
tion. Their hard work and dedication to the 
next generation of commercial fishermen is 
commendable. 
Currently, there is no single federal program 
dedicated to training, educating, and assisting

the next generation of commercial fishermen. 
However, the need for such a program is very 
real. Daunting challenges, including the high 
cost of entry, financial risks, and limited entry- 
level opportunities, have made it harder than 
ever for young men and women to start a ca-
reer in commercial fishing. 
That is why we have introduced H.R. 1240, 
the Young Fishermen’s Development Act, 
which is modeled after the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture’s Beginning Farmers and Ranchers 
Development Program. Our legislation seeks 
to support our nation’s aspiring commercial 
fishermen by creating a competitive grant pro-
gram at NOAA to support local training, edu-
cation, outreach, and technical assistance ini-
tiatives. 
The bill would provide funding to entities 
that offer instruction in seamanship, naviga-
tion, electronics, safety, vessel maintenance, 
entrepreneurship, 
sustainable 
fishing, 
and 
other efforts related to the commercial fishing 
business. The heritage and economies of 
America’s coastal communities are directly 
linked to our fisheries. 
Help us ensure that the next generation of 
commercial fishermen is well prepared to 
sustainably harvest America’s seafood by 
breaking down the many barriers facing young 
fishermen, I strongly support this bipartisan 
legislation and encourage all my colleagues to 
join me. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the

(B) the dissemination of education mate-
rials relating to the effects of drone incur-
sions on wildfire suppression. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 18 months 
after the date of the enactment of this Act,

ant to the rule, the gentleman from

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5040. This is a bipartisan bill intro-
duced by my fellow committee mem-
ber, Utah Congressman CURTIS, along 
with myself. 
The Aerial Incursion Repercussion 
Safety Act, or the AIR Safety Act, re-
quires the Director of BLM, in con-
sultation with the Chief of the Forest 
Service, the Federal Aviation Adminis-
tration, and the National Association 
of State Foresters, to conduct a study 
on the effects of drone incursion on 
wildfire suppression. 
It is already a Federal crime to inter-
fere with wildfire suppression efforts 
on public lands. In addition, the FAA 
often implements temporary flight re-
strictions, or TFRs, around wildfires to 
prevent aircraft from getting involved 
and interfering with suppression oper-
ations. 
Despite 
these 
deterrents, 
private 
drone incursions near wildfires con-
tinue to be documented as causes of 
delays in airborne firefighting response 
that can pose threats to firefighting on 
the ground, undermine ongoing sup-
pression efforts, and allow wildfires to 
encroach on nearby communities. 
There have been many examples of 
this, but I specifically remember, dur-
ing the October 2017 firestorms in 
Sonoma County, in my district, we re-
ceived multiple reports 
of 
private 
drones interfering with firefighting 
helicopters and air tankers, forcing 
them to stay grounded for the safety of 
the Cal Fire pilots during the critical 
days when we needed them in the air. 
This bill would raise awareness of the 
impacts 
of 
drone 
incursions 
on 
wildland fire suppression while exam-
ining ways to avoid future incursions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Sincerely, 
COLIN C. PETERSON, 
Chair. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5040, the AIR Safety Act, authored by 
Congressman JOHN CURTIS from Utah. 
This is a simple bill that will improve 
our ability to fight the wildfires that 
have continued to wreak havoc in our 
Western States. 
Although laws exist prohibiting in-
terference with wildfire fighting, many 
people still fly their private drones 
near fires to take pictures and videos. 
Unauthorized drones flying in these 
areas can cause all aerial firefighting 
tools, including helicopters dropping 
flame retardant, to be grounded, which 
wastes valuable time and money that 
could otherwise be used to suppress the 
fire and save lives and property. 
The AIR Safety Act directs our land 
management agencies to study drone 
incursions over the past 5 years and 
mandates that the agencies develop 
better strategies to prevent drones 
from interfering in firefighting activi-
ties in the first place. 
In the wake of yet another dev-
astating wildfire season, it is critical 
that we do everything we can to em-
power our brave wildland firefighters 
with the tools they need to safely and 
quickly respond to fires. This bipar-
tisan bill is a small but important step 
toward achieving that goal. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. CURTIS), who introduced the bill 
and has sponsored it, along with the bi-
partisan sponsorship of Mr. HUFFMAN. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman GRIJALVA and Ranking Mem-
ber BISHOP for helping us move this bill 
along. Special thanks to my cosponsor, 
who shares a not-so-unique problem in 
our districts of wildfires and fighting 
those. 
Mr. Speaker, I obviously rise in sup-
port of the AIR Safety Act, which will 
examine risks and effects of drone in-
cursions on wildland firefighting. 
In the last few years, Utah and the 
rest of the West have been battling ex-
treme wildfires. Our Federal land man-
agers and State and local partners need 
every tool available to them to put 
these fires out. 
When a wildfire breaks out, the FAA 
sets up a temporary flight restriction, 
or TFR, around the perimeter to allow 
aerial firefighters full access to the 
fire. 
Unfortunately, when people ignore 
these TFRs and fly their drones around 
the fire, fire management must ground 
their own drones and helicopters until 
the area is clear. This wastes valuable 
time and money, putting structures 
and, most importantly, lives at risk. 
The AIR Safety Act will direct the 
Forest Service, Bureau of Land Man-
agement, FAA, and State forestry part-
ners to examine these risks and come 
up with ways to stop future problems. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
quest an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5040, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed.

ROCKY 
MOUNTAIN 
NATIONAL 
PARK BOUNDARY MODIFICATION 
ACT 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5458) to modify the boundary of 
the Rocky Mountain National Park, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5458 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rocky 
Mountain National Park Boundary Modifica-
tion Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) MAP.—The term ‘‘map’’ means the map 
entitled ‘‘Rocky Mountain National Park 
Proposed Boundary Revision’’, numbered 121/ 
154,327, and dated June 2019. 
(2) NON-FEDERAL
LAND.—The term ‘‘non- 
Federal land’’ means the approximately 40 
acres of non-Federal land depicted as ‘‘TR 
05–133’’ on the map. 
(3) 
SECRETARY.—The 
term 
‘‘Secretary’’ 
means the Secretary of the Interior. 
SEC. 3. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK 
BOUNDARY MODIFICATION. 
(a) LAND ACQUISITION.—The Secretary may 
acquire, by donation, the non-Federal land 
for inclusion in the Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park. 
(b) BOUNDARY MODIFICATION.—On acquisi-
tion of the non-Federal land under sub-
section (a), the Secretary shall— 
(1) modify the boundary of the Rocky 
Mountain National Park to include the ac-
quisition; and 
(2) administer the acquired land as part of 
the Rocky Mountain National Park, in ac-
cordance with applicable laws. 
(c) AVAILABILITY OF MAP.—The map shall 
be on file and available for public inspection 
in appropriate offices of the National Park 
Service. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5458, the Rocky Mountain National 
Park Boundary Modification Act, the 
first of two bills introduced by my Col-
orado colleague, Representative JOE 
NEGUSE. 
This bill would modify the boundary 
of Colorado’s Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park to include approximately 
40 acres of non-Federal land that 
former U.S. astronaut Vance Brand 
hopes to donate to the park. 
This 40-acre tract will provide en-
hanced protections for the park’s high- 
elevation ecosystems and would in-
crease 
recreational 
access 
and 
connectivity by providing a natural 
buffer between private lands and three 
popular trails. 
Rocky Mountain National Park is 
home to many of our Nation’s most 
treasured landscapes, and I commend 
Representative NEGUSE for his efforts 
to expand and enhance protections for 
this park. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5458 authorizes the 
Secretary of the Interior to acquire, by 
donation only, approximately 40 acres 
of non-Federal land for inclusion in 
Rocky Mountain National Park in Col-
orado. 
As many of you may know, Rocky 
Mountain National Park is one of the 
crown jewels of our National Park Sys-
tem. 
The land to be donated is directly ad-
jacent to the current park boundary 
and was recently donated to the Rocky 
Mountain Conservancy. The land being 
donated is entirely undeveloped, so it 
won’t increase the deferred mainte-
nance of the National Park Service in 
any way. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7123 
December 10, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mr. 
NEGUSE). 
b 1000 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank Chairman HUFFMAN for his lead-
ership. 
I am proud to speak in support of two 
of my bills being considered today, 
H.R. 5458 and H.R. 5459. As you have 
heard, these bipartisan bills would ex-
tend Rocky Mountain National Park 
and ultimately create more opportuni-
ties for Coloradans and visitors to our 
State to enjoy outdoor activities. 
H.R. 5458, the bill before the House 
right now, the Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park Boundary Modification 
Act, as has been articulated previously, 
would formally codify a generous dona-
tion into the park boundary made by 
former astronaut and Longmont, Colo-
rado, native, Vance Brand. 
Mr. Brand bravely served our country 
in the Armed Forces and then served as 
an astronaut, and he has now so gener-
ously agreed to donate roughly 40 acres 
to Rocky Mountain National Park. 
This expansion would add additional 
protections for the park’s high ele-
vation ecosystem and provide rec-
reational access to literally hundreds 
of miles of trails. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have in-
troduced both of these legislative pro-
posals, which came at the request of 
local communities that I have the 
honor of representing back in Colorado 
and that ultimately seek to protect the 
public lands that they love. The bills 
enjoy the support from the town of 
Estes Park, Larimer County, and the 
Rocky Mountain Conservancy. 
As one of the Nation’s most historic 
parks, Rocky Mountain National Park 
remains one of the top-visited public 
lands in our country, attracting over 
4.6 million people, annually, in recent 
years. Given the park’s breathtaking 
scenery and iconic significance, these 
numbers are only anticipated to rise. 
I know my good friend from the Fifth 
Congressional District of Colorado, 
Representative LAMBORN, knows Rocky 
Mountain National Park well. I am 
sure, like me, he and his family have 
had countless opportunities to enjoy 
the park and its breathtaking scenery. 
It is an honor to be able to represent 
Rocky Mountain National Park here in 
the United States Congress. 
People from all over the world are 
drawn to the park, each for their own 
reasons, to experience nature, seek sol-
itude, watch wildlife, and partake in 
outstanding recreational activities. I, 
myself, hold a number of treasured 
memories growing up in Colorado and 
enjoying Rocky Mountain National 
Park: hikes with my father and now 
being able to take my daughter on 
those same trails. It is something that 
holds deep meaning for many Ameri-
cans, and especially for Coloradans. 
As we collectively seek healing dur-
ing and after the COVID–19 pandemic, 
our public lands offer both a mental 
and physical refuge as well as an eco-
nomic stimulus for the local commu-
nities that rely on them. 
Additionally—and this bears men-
tioning—this 
year, 
devastating 
wildfires have occurred across Colo-
rado, forcing evacuations, threatening 
air and water quality, and destroying 
homes and businesses. Three of the 
State’s five largest fires in the history 
of Colorado occurred in 2020. 
While the bulk of these fires were on 
lands surrounding Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park, nearly 30,000 acres burned 
within the park’s boundary. When the 
East Troublesome fire grew over 100,000 
acres in 1 day and swept through a por-
tion of the park, a number of park 
structures were lost. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to take this op-
portunity to thank the superintendent 
of the Rocky Mountain National Park 
and her wonderful rangers and all of 
the personnel at Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park who work tirelessly to pro-
tect the park and the communities 
that surround it. 
Given the devastating nature of these 
wildfires, in addition to the COVID–19 
pandemic, fulfilling the requests of 
local Colorado communities that have 
been impacted by, not one, but two, 
historic disasters is an even greater 
imperative. 
Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I re-
spectfully urge my colleagues to sup-
port both H.R. 5458 and H.R. 5459, bipar-
tisan bills that will protect our treas-
ured public lands. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
quest an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5458. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ROCKY 
MOUNTAIN 
NATIONAL 
PARK OWNERSHIP CORRECTION 
ACT 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5459) to authorize the Secretary 
of the Interior to correct a land owner-
ship error within the boundary of 
Rocky Mountain National Park, and 
for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5459 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rocky 
Mountain National Park Ownership Correc-
tion Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) FEDERAL
LAND.—The term ‘‘Federal 
land’’ means the approximately 0.18 acres of 
land depicted as ‘‘TR04–168–1’’ on the map. 
(2) MAP.—The term ‘‘map’’ means the map 
entitled ‘‘Rocky Mountain National Park 
Proposed Forsyth Family Land Exchange’’, 
numbered 121/154,326, and dated June 2019. 
(3) NON-FEDERAL
LAND.—The term ‘‘non- 
Federal land’’ means the approximately 0.18 
acres of land depicted as ‘‘TR04–169’’ on the 
map. 
(4) 
SECRETARY.—The 
term 
‘‘Secretary’’ 
means the Secretary of the Interior. 
SEC. 3. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK LAND 
EXCHANGE. 
(a) AUTHORIZATION OF EXCHANGE.—To cor-
rect a longstanding land ownership error, if 
the owner of the non-Federal land offers to 
convey to the Secretary all right, title, and 
interest of the owner in and to the non-Fed-
eral land, the Secretary shall convey to the 
owner of the non-Federal land, subject to 
valid existing rights, all right, title, and in-
terest of the United States in and to the Fed-
eral land. 
(b) VALUATION.—The value of the Federal 
land and the non-Federal land to be ex-
changed under this Act shall be considered 
to be of equal value. 
(c) ADMINISTRATION.—The non-Federal land 
acquired by the Secretary under this section 
shall be administered by the Secretary as 
part of Rocky Mountain National Park. 
(d) AVAILABILITY OF MAP.—The map shall 
be on file and available for inspection in the 
appropriate offices of the National Park 
Service. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on the 
measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5459, the Rocky Mountain National 
Park Ownership Correction Act, intro-
duced again by my colleague, JOE 
NEGUSE. 
In the 1970s, a tiny 0.18-acre plot of 
land containing the Forsyth family 
cabin was erroneously transferred to 
Rocky Mountain National Park when 
the Park Service purchased land sur-
rounding a private inholding. 
Since the error was discovered, the 
Park Service has been working with 
the Forsyth family to correct the legal 
ownership and exchange parcels, and 
the family is currently using its cabin 
through a special use permit. This bill 
would permanently resolve this owner-
ship issue and ensure the intent of the 
original purchase is met by authorizing 
an equal value land exchange between 
the Forsyth family and the Secretary 
of the Interior.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7124 
December 10, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rep-
resentative NEGUSE for his efforts to 
resolve this longstanding ownership 
issue, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5459 authorizes the 
Secretary of the Interior to exchange a 
0.18-acre parcel of park land for the 
same amount of private land to resolve 
a land ownership issue within the 
boundary of the Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park. 
In the 1970s, the National Park Serv-
ice purchased land surrounding a pri-
vate inholding. An error in the bank’s 
legal description incorrectly included a 
0.18-acre parcel in that purchase. As a 
result, the parcel the National Park 
Service acquired included a family 
cabin, and the private owner acquired a 
vacant lot, not the cabin site. 
This bill will permanently resolve 
this issue with an equal value land 
swap and ensure that the intent of the 
original purchase is met. This may be 
the tiniest amount of land that we 
have ever considered in a land use bill, 
but it is, nevertheless, an important 
piece of land and a good bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5459. 
The question was taken; and (two-

rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

SAGUARO 
NATIONAL 
PARK 
BOUNDARY 
EXPANSION 
AND 
STUDY ACT OF 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7098) to expand the boundary of 
Saguaro National Park, to study addi-
tional land for future adjustments to 
the boundary of the park, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7098 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Saguaro Na-
tional Park Boundary Expansion and Study 
Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. BOUNDARY OF SAGUARO NATIONAL 
PARK. 
Section 4 of the Saguaro National Park Es-
tablishment Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–364; 
108 Stat. 3467) is amended— 
(1) in subsection (a)— 
(A) by inserting ‘‘(1)’’ before ‘‘The bound-
aries of the park’’; and 
(B) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(2)(A) The boundaries of the park are fur-
ther modified to include approximately 1,232 
acres, as generally depicted on the map ti-
tled ‘Saguaro National Parkl Proposed 
Boundary Adjustment’, numbered 151/80,045G, 
and dated October 2020. 
‘‘(B) The map referred to in subparagraph 
(A) shall be on file and available for inspec-
tion in the appropriate offices of the Na-
tional Park Service.’’; 
(2) by striking subsection (b)(2) and insert-
ing the following new paragraphs: 
‘‘(2) The Secretary may, with the consent 
of the State of Arizona and in accordance 
with Federal and State law, acquire land or 
interests therein owned by the State of Ari-
zona within the boundary of the park. 
‘‘(3) If the Secretary is unable to acquire 
the State land under paragraph (2), the Sec-
retary may enter into an agreement with the 
State that would allow the National Park 
Service to manage State land within the 
boundary of the park.’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following new 
subsection: 
‘‘(d) BOUNDARY STUDY.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall con-
duct a study to identify any lands outside 
the boundaries of the park that may be ap-
propriate for inclusion in the park. 
‘‘(2) CRITERIA.—The study shall be con-
ducted in accordance with National Park 
Service criteria for boundary adjustment 
studies. 
‘‘(3) REPORT.—Not later than 3 years after 
the date funds are made available for the 
study under this subsection, the Secretary 
shall submit to the Committee on Natural 
Resources of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources of the Senate a report on the find-
ings, conclusions, and recommendations of 
the study.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on the 
measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 7098, a bill introduced by the 
chairman of the Natural Resources 
Committee, Raul Grijalva from Ari-
zona. 
This bill would modify the bound-
aries of Saguaro National Park and au-
thorize the Secretary of the Interior to 
acquire lands within these new bound-
aries from willing sellers. The bill 
would also require the Secretary to 
study future potential boundary expan-
sions and land acquisitions that would 
add to the park’s natural, cultural, and 
recreational resources. 
Saguaro National Park is a true 
urban oasis, located in the Tucson met-
ropolitan area in Chairman GRIJALVA’s 
hometown. This park provides habitat 
for iconic species, including its name-
sake—the 
saguaro 
cactus—and 
the 
desert tortoise, and it provides unpar-
alleled recreational resources, such as 
hiking and mountain biking trails. 
The expansion authorized in this bill 
would add to those abundant resources 
and provide an important linkage be-
tween the park and Pima County’s 
Sweetwater Preserve, expanding access 
to southern Arizona’s public lands. 
There is broad local support for this 
expansion, which includes the Pima 
County 
Administrator, 
the 
Tucson 
Mountain 
Homeowners 
Association, 
and each individual owner of the land 
identified for inclusion in the park. 
This bill is not just a win for the resi-
dents of southern Arizona; it is also a 
win for our national parks and public 
lands. 
Expanding the future of conservation 
and access to public lands is a hall-
mark of Chairman GRIJALVA’s leader-
ship, so I want to thank him for that 
and for his hard work on this bill, and 
I urge its swift adoption by the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7098 would expand 
the boundary of Saguaro National 
Park, Arizona, by a cumulative total of 
approximately 1,232 acres. 
For those who haven’t visited this 
park, it is another one of the jewels of 
our National Park System. I have been 
there, and I would urge everyone who 
has a chance to also visit this beautiful 
place. 
The bill also authorizes the Sec-
retary of the Interior to acquire land 
owned by the State of Arizona within 
the boundary of the park. 
In addition, the bill also authorizes 
agreements where the National Park 
Service would manage State-owned 
land within the boundary of the park 
where acquisition is not possible. 
Finally, the bill also authorizes a 
study to identify future potential park 
expansions to better protect desert 
habitats in the greater Tucson area. 
Now, while I don’t understand why 
the State of Arizona would want the 
National Park Service to manage any 
more land within its boundaries, this 
bill does go about expanding a park 
unit in the right way: through an open, 
deliberative process in Congress. This 
bill authorizes a rather large addition 
to the park, but we heard no local op-
position to the expansion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I yield the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time.

titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on the 
measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7489, the Long Bridge Act, introduced 
by our colleague, Representative WITT-
MAN, from Virginia. 
This bill is a simple piece of legisla-
tion, but it is important. It authorizes 
the National Park Service to convey 
select parcels of land to the Common-
wealth of Virginia or the District of 
Columbia in order to facilitate updates 
to the Long Bridge, a critical com-
muter and freight rail corridor in the 
Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. 
b 1015 
The existing bridge, which is used by 
Amtrak, the Virginia Railway Express, 
and CSX Transportation was built all 
the way back in 1904. It has not been 
substantially upgraded since 1942. 
The current project is a partnership 
between the U.S. Department of Trans-
portation, the Virginia Department of 
Rail and Transportation, and the Dis-
trict of Columbia, and it will double 
capacity of the bridge by constructing 
a second bridge alongside the existing 
structure. 
Allowing the National Park Service 
to convey small tracts of land will fa-
cilitate completion of this very impor-
tant upgrade. 
To be clear, we are not talking about 
land that includes historic resources, 
open space, or park-like qualities. 
The agency has final say in what can 
be transferred, and the bill includes 
important safeguards to ensure that 
the land identified for conveyance is 
used only for railroad purposes. 
This project is a priority for this re-
gion, and I am happy to lend my sup-
port to this commonsense, bipartisan 
solution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
H.R. 7489, offered by our Natural Re-
sources Committee colleague from Vir-
ginia, Mr. WITTMAN, authorizes the 
Secretary of the Interior to convey 
about 4.4 acres of Federal property for 
the construction of a new commuter 
rail and pedestrian bridge spanning the 
Potomac. 
Current law allows a right of way for 
railroads on most Federal lands, but 
not for railroads on National Park 
Service lands, therefore, legislation is 
needed to authorize a small amount of 
National Park System land to be con-
veyed or used by Virginia to construct 
a railroad. 
The Long Bridge Project will double 
the capacity of the Potomac River rail 
crossing by adding a second two-track 
bridge adjacent to the existing bridge, 
as well as a pedestrian crossing. 
I commend Representative WITTMAN 
for his hard work on the Long Bridge 
Project and for this bipartisan and tri- 
jurisdiction legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER). 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Today I rise in support of the Long 
Bridge Act of 2020, which I proudly 
colead with my colleague from Vir-
ginia, Congressman ROB WITTMAN. 
The existing Long Bridge is the only 
rail bridge connecting Virginia to 
Washington, D.C., and it is the main 
rail connection between the southeast 
and northeast for both passenger and 
freight rail. 
The Long Bridge is old and rusty and 
ugly and a treasured part of our land-
scape. It was authorized by Congress in 
1808 and signed into law by President 
Thomas Jefferson. It cost $200,000 to 
build initially. 
Now, during peak hours, the two- 
track bridge is at almost 98 percent ca-
pacity, which makes it a significant 
chokepoint along the East Coast from 
Washington, D.C., all the way to Flor-
ida. 
That is why the Long Bridge Project 
is so crucial. It would double the capac-
ity of the Potomac River rail crossing 
by adding a second two-track bridge 
adjacent to the existing bridge. 
Mr. Speaker, I cannot stress how 
impactful the new Long Bridge Project 
will be, projecting an annual $6 billion 
in benefits to the region by 2040. 
However, the land where construc-
tion will take place on both sides of the 
Potomac River is controlled by the Na-
tional Park Service, and it is currently

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7126 
December 10, 2020 
prohibited by law to transfer land to 
the Commonwealth of Virginia and the 
District of Columbia for the purposes 
of railroad construction. 
That is where our bill comes in. 
The Long Bridge Act of 2020 is a sim-
ple fix to allow the National Park 
Service to transfer control of this land 
for the purpose of the Long Bridge rail 
project. 
So I wholeheartedly support this bill. 
This will enable the Commonwealth of 
Virginia to move forward with this 
vital construction. 
I thank my colleagues from Virginia, 
D.C., and Maryland on both sides of the 
aisle for supporting this bill. And I 
thank, again, my colleague, ROB WITT-
MAN, for his efforts on behalf of the 
Long Bridge Act of 2020. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITT-
MAN). 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman HUFFMAN, Ranking Member 
LAMBORN, 
and 
my colleague, Rep-
resentative DON BEYER for the united 
effort to make sure that we get this 
Long Bridge bill passed, to make sure 
we get a new Long Bridge built, be-
cause we know that this is critically 
important, not just for Virginia, for 
the District, and for Maryland, but for 
the Nation because of the critical link 
point that it is for transportation. 
As we know, this is in some ways 
looked at as a regional project, but it 
is actually more than that. 
The First District of Virginia, the 
district that I represent, spans the I–95 
corridor in Northern Virginia, which 
includes one of the worst traffic hot 
spots in the Nation. That is undeni-
able. In fact, who knows it better than 
Members here in Congress what they 
have to deal with each day in their 
commute. 
As a daily commuter myself, I under-
stand the frustration that folks have. 
This is going to be a critical point for 
us to be able to use rail as a very effi-
cient means by which to move people 
and to move commerce throughout the 
region. Incredibly important. And with 
passage of this bill, Congress is pro-
viding the adequate resources to lever-
age the Commonwealth’s investment to 
address issues on I–95. 
It has been a great cooperative agree-
ment between the Commonwealth of 
Virginia and CSX, who owns the line, 
to make sure that this gets done. It is 
really unprecedented in what they have 
agreed to, and it is not just this line, 
but it is also all the connectors. So this 
is a great step to really enhance our 
rail system, which we know is incred-
ibly important to address transpor-
tation issues, not just across the east-
ern seaboard but really across the Na-
tion. 
An important component of this in 
reducing traffic congestion in this re-
gion, as I said, is commuter rail. And 
this bridge spans the Potomac, one of 
those 
chokepoints, 
the 
major 
chokepoint here on the eastern sea-
board. 
It is very heavily traveled. There has 
to be a balance between transit from a 
commuter standpoint, passenger rail, 
and freight rail. And many times there 
is a battle back and forth, and, unfor-
tunately, freight rail prevails in that 
since freight companies own the rail. 
We want to make sure that there is 
balance there, and this provides a bal-
ance. 
And I have to give CSX credit for 
coming to the table and saying, listen, 
we understand how incredibly impor-
tant passenger rail is. Even though 
that is not within their purview, they 
do see how important that is. So it is a 
real testament to a lot of different en-
tities coming together to make this 
work. 
And just as Representative BEYER 
said, the existing bridge is at 98 per-
cent capacity during peak hours, and is 
used by both VRE, the Virginia Rail-
way Express, Amtrak, and CSX. There 
is a lot of traffic coming across that 
bridge; we want to make sure that it 
can all be accommodated. 
We know the proposed design for a 
new track bridge upstream of the cur-
rent Long Bridge and five additional 
bridges in Virginia and D.C. provide 
those connectors and conduits that we 
need for the region. 
The bill authorizes the Secretary of 
the Interior, through the National 
Park Service director, to convey to and 
authorize the use by both Virginia and 
D.C. to be able to utilize a small sec-
tion of National Park Service land for 
the construction of the new Long 
Bridge structure for rail and for an ad-
ditional, as we have heard, walkable 
and bikeable pedestrian bridge span-
ning the Potomac River; incredibly im-
portant for the region. 
The bill will also convey title and in-
terest to Virginia of about 4.4 perma-
nent acres of National Park Service 
land for the express purpose of this 
project. 
The National Park Service will au-
thorize Virginia to temporarily use 8.4 
acres of land for the construction 
which reverts back to the National 
Park Service at the discretion of the 
NPS director when the project gets 
completed. So it is essentially con-
struction use while equipment is there, 
but then it reverts back to the Na-
tional Park Service. 
This project supports projected in-
creases in passenger and freight rail 
through this corridor, not only now but 
in the future, and it also enhances eco-
nomic growth and mobility for the re-
gion. 
It increases the capacity of the rail 
network for many areas, including the 
Port of Virginia, which handles 37 per-
cent of goods that move in and out of 
that port by rail; a great enhancer. 
The Port of Virginia will need to in-
crease that share to 45 percent by 2040 
to handle a threefold increase in ship-
ments. This will help them do that. 
Building a new Long Bridge doubles 
the rail capacity at this major bottle-
neck and is incredibly important for 
the eastern seaboard but also region-
ally, for not only Virginia and the Dis-
trict, but also, Maryland; so all incred-
ibly important. 
The legislation is a significant mile-
stone in transforming passenger and 
freight rail service along the East 
Coast and really making a significant 
step forward in increasing the capacity 
and opportunity for freight rail. 
The construction is a project of 
major 
national 
significance 
in 
unlocking the gridlock in this region 
and is incredibly important. 
Finally, I want to thank again the 
leadership on the Natural Resources 
Committee, Chairman HUFFMAN, Rank-
ing Member LAMBORN, and my col-
league DON BEYER for coleading this ef-
fort and also Representative HOLMES 
NORTON and the rest of the members of 
the regional delegations and staff for 
making this important element work. 
I also thank Senators MARK WARNER 
and TIM KAINE for introducing the Sen-
ate companion bill over on the Senate 
side. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further witnesses, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7489, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-
ished business is the vote on the mo-
tion to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 906) to improve the manage-
ment of driftnet fishing, on which the 
yeas and nays were ordered. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7138 
December 10, 2020 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend for yielding, the Republican 
whip from the grand State of Lou-
isiana. 
As the gentleman is aware as a result 
of his service in previous Congresses, 
when we get to the last days of the 
Congress, it is very difficult to predict 
the schedule because the reason we 
have not already passed something is 
because it is controversial, and we are 
trying to work out an agreement. 
In that context, Mr. Speaker, I am 
advising Members that they will not be 
expected to be back here to vote on any 
piece of legislation prior to Tuesday 
next at 6:30 p.m. 
The reason for that is because an 
agreement has not been reached on ei-
ther COVID–19 legislation or the omni-
bus for the funding of the government 
for the balance of the year between 
now and September 30. 
As a result, even if an agreement 
were reached tomorrow, the time for 
the staff to put it in bill language and 
to file it would take us at least until 
Tuesday. So, there is no point in hav-
ing Members here with nothing to do. 
However, as I know the minority 
whip agrees with me, we need to get 
those two bills done in one form or an-
other. I am hopeful that over the next 
72, 96 hours, that there will be a lot of 
work being done. 
I want to let the public know that in 
the Senate and in the House, both on 
the Democratic side and on the Repub-
lican side, Members are working hard 
to resolve the differences that still 
exist because I think both sides under-
stand the critical nature of passing 
COVID–19 legislation where we have 
millions of people, millions of small 
businesses, 
millions 
of 
healthcare 
workers waiting for us to resolve these 
issues so that they can confront the 
challenges that COVID–19 has created 
both on the health side and on the eco-
nomic side. 
I would say that if we can get that 
done, that we may vote, as I said, as 
early as Tuesday at 6:30. But I will say 
that we will not leave—when I say 
‘‘leave,’’ we will not adjourn the 116th 
Congress until we get those two bills 
done because they have to be done. 
I thank the gentleman for the ques-
tion, and that is the answer. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I agree 
that we need to continue these negotia-
tions and get a resolution, and, hope-
fully, we will in the coming week, both 
on COVID relief and on the funding of 
government. 
We have agreed on caps already. 
Hopefully, we will maintain that and 
get that done to give certainty to all of 
our agencies that we know how much 
money is involved. 
It costs the Defense Department, for 
example, every week that we are in a 
continuing resolution, potentially bil-
lions of dollars just in procurement and 
in the loss of those efficiencies. 
I share the gentleman’s optimism 
that we can get it done. Obviously, we 
need to continue working through 
these final issues. 
I do want to thank the gentleman, as 
we talked last week at the colloquy 
about the ALS Disability Insurance 
Access Act, and I thank the gentleman 
for scheduling it this week. It passed 
without opposition. This is one of those 
examples where we do work and come 
together and do something that actu-
ally helps people. 
This will help hundreds, possibly 
thousands, of people struggling with 
ALS to be able to get access to the 
tools that they need that they, under 
the current law, are being denied. To 
see the House come together so over-
whelmingly to do that shows that we 
can, when we put our minds to it, actu-
ally help people. 
This will help people in all of our dis-
tricts, and I thank the gentleman, 
again, for getting that done, getting 
that bill to the floor, and, ultimately, 
now all of us coming together to pass 
that bill on to the Senate and the 
President. 
I want to again bring up the Pay-
check Protection Program bill by Con-
gressman CHABOT. This is a bill that we 
have been talking about at this col-
loquy since September. Each week that 
goes by, we know that there is a list— 
unfortunately, it is a long list—of 
areas where we have disagreement. 
There is also a list of areas where we 
have full agreement if you look at the 
number of items where we have already 
decided 
we 
both, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, want to do this. Then, 
there are those items that we are 
strongly opposed to on our side or that 
they are strongly opposed to on their 
side. 
I would just continue to emphasize 
that these small businesses can’t wait 
for us to get agreement or never get an 
agreement, while there are things we 
can do to help them today, to save 
them today. 
And we continue to hear the heart-
breaking 
stories. 
Over 
100,000 
res-
taurants in America have closed for 
good. Gone. I know K-Paul’s restaurant 
in New Orleans, one of the world-fa-
mous restaurants. International Chef 
Paul Prudhomme invented blackened 
redfish at that restaurant. It is gone. 
There are too many other stories to 
mention. We see heartbreaking stories 
of a restaurant owner in Los Angeles 
who is being told she can’t operate, and 
literally, in the same parking lot next 
to her tents are tents of a film studio 
that is able to operate. 
It is not about science in those cases. 
It is about some government official 
picking winners and losers. Unfortu-
nately, the losers are America’s small 
businesses. 
This needs to stop. I would just en-
courage the gentleman to bring the 
Chabot bill, a bill that has wide bipar-
tisan support that would save small 
businesses. Today, we are going to lose, 
just today, about 150 restaurants, and 
that number is even higher for other 
small businesses. There are hundreds a 
day. 
Friday, we will lose 150 restaurants. 
Saturday, we will lose 150 restaurants. 
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, we will lose 
150. We will lose over 700 restaurants 
between now and when we come back 
Tuesday. 
We don’t have to do that. If that bill 
was put on the floor today, it would 
have passed overwhelmingly, maybe 
unanimously, because it is an area of 
agreement. 
This idea of holding hostage these 
small businesses that are dying on the 
vine while we try to get agreement 
that we haven’t been able to get since 
August, why can’t we just do the 
things that we agree on now while we 
negotiate the other things? 
Some of those things will never be-
come law, yet it is holding up the 
things that we agree on that would 
save small businesses today. 150 res-
taurants today will go under that 
shouldn’t have gone under. We could 
have saved them. 
There are thousands of jobs tied to 
this at Christmastime that don’t need 
to be gone if we just pass the things we 
agree on while we negotiate the things 
we don’t; because we may never get 
agreement on those things. But don’t 
let it hold these families hostage. 
Don’t let it hold these small businesses 
hostage. 
I would just urge, again, that the 
gentleman bring the Chabot bill to the 
floor as soon as possible. We know it 
would pass overwhelmingly. 
I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his observations. 
In fact, I am for an agreement that is 
being worked on right now that has 
$300 billion, a third of the $908 billion, 
that is set aside for small businesses 
for exactly the reasons that the whip 
points out, that we want to make sure 
that we can keep as many small busi-
nesses in business as possible, which is 
why we ought to pass legislation. 
But we are not holding small busi-
nesses hostage any more than we are 
holding those on unemployment hos-
tage, any more than we are holding 
States and localities hostage, any more 
than we are holding schools hostage, 
any more than we are holding childcare 
and CDBG hostage or emergency as-
sistance or farm aid or nutrition aid. 
None of those are being held hostage. 
What is happening is, they all need to 
get resources to meet the challenges 
they face. That is what we believe 
needs to happen. 
All of those need to be addressed. All 
of those need to be included in a bill 
that, hopefully, we will pass in the 
early part of next week. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, we will 
continue to push to get that relief, 
starting with the Chabot bill—hope-
fully, with other things. But at least 
let’s bring those items that we are in 
agreement on to the floor. Millions of 
jobs are at stake. 
Finally, I want to ask the majority 
leader about reports that have come up 
about a member of the Intelligence 
Committee, 
Mr. 
SWALWELL, 
having 
some kind of ties to a Chinese spy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7139 
December 10, 2020 
There are alarming issues that are 
being raised. We haven’t gotten a lot of 
answers. I know many are asking: Was 
it known prior to the time he was put 
on the Intelligence Committee that 
there was this relationship with a Chi-
nese spy? 
There are also reports that the Chi-
nese spy also was able to infiltrate his 
office and possibly put other spies in 
his office. 
Was the gentleman aware? Maybe it 
was just the Speaker that was aware, 
but were you all aware of this tie to a 
Chinese spy prior to him being put on 
the committee? And why is he still on 
the Intelligence Committee? 
I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. I don’t have the facts, 
but, obviously, our position is if there 
are facts being raised that ought to be 
looked at, they ought to be looked at. 
But I don’t have the facts, and I don’t 
want to comment on the issue itself be-
cause I don’t know enough about it to 
do so. But I think all due diligence will 
be pursued. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, and I hope we get those 
answers. These are serious questions 
that have been raised. And we are talk-
ing about a committee that deals with 
the most sensitive intelligence infor-
mation. 
In fact, most Members of Congress 
don’t have access to that level of intel-
ligence that members of the Intel-
ligence Committee get, and possibly 
their staffs have the ability to see 
some of that. 
If an office was infiltrated by spies 
from a foreign country, especially 
China, at a time when we are inves-
tigating China and raising serious 
questions about them, these are ques-
tions that need to be answered, and I 
hope we get answers soon. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. I didn’t mention one bill 
that is still percolating. We passed it 
335–78. The Senate passed it, I think, 
86–14, or something. The National De-
fense Authorization Act is going to be 
going to the President soon. I am hope-
ful the President will sign it. 
If he does not sign it, that will be an-
other issue that may be considered. 
On the other hand, I have indications 
that perhaps there will be a substantial 
number of Republicans who voted for 
the bill who may not vote to pass it 
over the President’s veto. So, we will 
have that to consider as well. 
I hadn’t mentioned that, and I want-
ed to mention that that is still on the 
docket. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. 
Clearly, President Trump has ex-
pressed his concerns about some items 
in and not in the National Defense Au-
thorization Act. Ultimately, we will 
see soon if he signs it or vetoes it. He 
has, obviously, got to weigh all of 
those decisions, as he is doing right 
now. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I hope he 
will sign it. I know he has concerns 
about a section that Senator INHOFE 
said ought not to be in the bill. But 
whether it should or should not, it is 
not in the bill, and the conferees deter-
mined that it should not be in the bill. 
As the gentleman knows, this has 
great consequences for our national se-
curity and for our troops. I would hope 
the gentleman would, and I would, urge 
the President to sign the bill. 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, and I will continue to 
work on these items that we need to 
get resolved—hopefully, will get re-
solved—in the coming days. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

HONORING JOSEPH H. RAINEY 
(Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my appreciation to 
this august body for unanimously pass-
ing H. Res. 1253. I also want to thank 
Speaker NANCY PELOSI and Minority 
Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY for their sup-
port of the passage of this resolution. 
This resolution honors the life and 
legacy of Joseph H. Rainey, a fellow 
South Carolinian, who, on December 
12, 1870, became the first African Amer-
ican to serve in the United States 
House of Representatives, blazing the 
trail that provided the path that I am 
honored to be on today. 
With the passage of this resolution, 
the House permanently recognizes Con-
gressman 
Rainey’s 
remarkable 
achievement 150 years ago from Satur-
day. They are honoring him by renam-
ing H–150 on the first floor of this 
building, which is the room in which he 
met at the time he was a member of 
the Committee on Indian Affairs, on 
which he served from 1873 to 1875. 
f 
NATIONAL IMPAIRED DRIVING 
PREVENTION MONTH 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, Decem-
ber is National Impaired Driving Pre-
vention Month. We know that during 
this time of the year, with so many 
holidays in a compact amount of time, 
that the risk is higher. Indeed, over 
one-third of traffic-related deaths in 
the United States involve a drunk driv-
er; and we know that, throughout the 
holiday season, drunk-driving crashes 
increase. 
For example, last December nearly 
1,000 people in the U.S. died in alcohol- 
related crashes, and 35 of those hap-
pened on Christmas Day. Every single 
one of those deaths is preventable. 
I sincerely thank our law enforce-
ment and our first responders for being 
there on the scene during these trage-
dies and working to prevent them from 
being worse and from having these im-
paired accidents happen. However, the 
decision to drive sober comes from tak-
ing personal responsibility for all of 
our actions and making travel plans 
before your holiday celebrations begin. 
Let’s keep every seat at our Christ-
mas tables and at our holiday tables 
during this time of year safely filled 
with family and friends instead of trag-
edy. Let’s make sure our loved ones are 
making smart choices and help them 
out to be smart and safe during this 
time of the year. 
f 
COVID RELIEF 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to demand that my Republican 
colleagues put aside partisan politics 
and provide relief to the millions of 
Americans whose lives have been up-
ended by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Our country is facing the worst eco-
nomic crisis since the Great Depres-
sion, yet the Federal Government has 
failed to aid the families struggling to 
keep food on the table, the small busi-
nesses shutting their doors and laying 
off employees during the holiday sea-
son, and State and local governments 
trying to keep communities afloat. 
It has been 9 long months since we 
passed meaningful legislation to sup-
port our fellow Americans. This is a 
dangerously long time, and the pan-
demic has only gotten worse. 
It is our responsibility to meet the 
scale and scope of this pandemic and 
get people the help they have been des-
perately waiting for. We must work to-
gether and finally pass a relief bill im-
mediately. Families cannot afford to 
wait another day.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARLEY ROUDA 
(Mr. PHILLIPS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor my dear 
friend and colleague, Representative 
HARLEY ROUDA, on the occasion of his 
59th birthday today. 
Congressman ROUDA is as passionate 
as he is principled, and a reliable voice 
of reason during very unreasonable 
times. In celebrating him today, I am 
reminded of the words of Teddy Roo-
sevelt, who wrote: 
It is not the critic who counts; not the man 
who points out how the strong man stum-
bles, or where the doer of deeds could have

done them better. The credit belongs to the 
man who was actually in the arena, who ac-
tually strives to do the deeds, and spends 
himself in a worthy cause. 
Mr. Speaker, just like the former 
President, I know that HARLEY’s place 
will always be in the arena and never 
on the sidelines. 
Annalise joins my family and yours— 
Kaira, Trace, Avery, Shea, and Dylan— 
in wishing HARLEY a happy and healthy 
birthday and a whole lot of love. 
f 
WORKING FOR THE INLAND 
EMPIRE 
(Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the Inland Empire of 
southern California, the region my 
family has called home for generations. 
As we stand here today, people in 
communities like mine and across the 
country are hurting. They are mourn-
ing loved ones, they are missing pay-
checks, and they are wondering what 
their government is doing to make the 
situation better. 
Right now, Democrats in Congress 
are laser focused on providing the re-
lief the American people need in this 
pandemic. We have been for months. 
We passed the CARES Act in March, 
but we didn’t stop there. We passed the 
Heroes Act in May, and then we passed 
the updated Heroes Act. 
We have continued to work on behalf 
of the American people, and our Repub-
lican counterparts have not met us 
halfway. Senate Republicans’ months 
of inaction have led to a dire situation 
across this country, and it is uncon-
scionable for them to continue to do 
nothing as we approach the holidays. 
We have lost valuable time, and it is 
my hope that, using the bipartisan 
framework, we can reach an agreement 
as soon as possible. To do nothing in 
the face of this much pain is unaccept-
able. The people we represent have en-
trusted us with an enormous responsi-
bility, and we cannot let them down. 
f 
COVID–19 RELIEF 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has devastated our 
country for 9 months now. More than 
15 million Americans have been in-
fected. Nearly 300,000 are dead. Our 
economy is on the ropes. Folks are 
struggling just to get by, and Demo-
crats have been trying to pass a relief 
package for months. 
Last week, Republicans finally met 
us at the table to negotiate a solution. 
We need to get this deal done. It must 
address the urgent needs of the Amer-
ican people by providing direct cash 
payments for working families; strong-
er unemployment payments; relief for 
cities and towns; new resources for the 
frontline workers who are keeping our 
communities safe; and funding for test-
ing, vaccines, hospitals, and commu-
nity health centers so we can end this 
pandemic and get back to our lives. 
The American people sent us here to 
work for them. They have waited for 
far too long for Congress to pass a new 
relief package. Let’s get this done on 
their behalf and let’s not leave Wash-
ington until we do. 
f 
GOVERNMENT OVERREACH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honor to agree with the comments that 
have just been made. We do need to 
come together and provide assistance 
to the American public, to those who 
have been so extremely adversely af-
fected, not merely by COVID, but by 
the, in some cases, very offensive uses 
of government power and actually un-
authorized power in numerous cir-
cumstances taking away people’s free-
dom for the first time in American his-
tory when they were not sick, quaran-
tining people who were not ill, shutting 
down businesses, picking and choosing 
winners and losers among businesses. 
Yet we, as Republicans, have been beg-
ging our friends across the aisle, come 
on, there are things ready to be used— 
readymade. 
The money that was appropriated 
several months ago—there is over $100 
billion, maybe a whole lot more than 
$100 billion—is waiting to be used, but 
the deadlines in that initial bill have 
been exceeded. So all we need to do is 
say that money is available again. It is 
still just sitting there. 
As businesses are going bankrupt, my 
friends across the aisle are allowing 
them to go bankrupt and basically 
holding them for hostage and saying: 
We are going to keep letting businesses 
go broke; we are not going to let you 
use the money that is sitting there 
waiting to be used to help these busi-
nesses to save them from bankruptcy 
and to keep them in business; and we 
are going to let them keep going out of 
business because we want a big com-
prehensive bill. 
As I have said previously here, com-
prehensive bills is a term that means 
we want to make it so big that we can 
stuff all kinds of pork in there that you 
won’t be able to find before we pass it. 
That is what is meant in Congress by 
comprehensive bill. 
We ought to avoid comprehensive 
bills and we ought to have rival shots 
addressing just what needs to be ad-
dressed and not putting everybody’s fa-
vorite gift in the legislation. 
So we could have agreed on that 
months ago. I understand the position 
of the majority Democrats is that 
there have just been so many other im-
portant things that we haven’t been 
able to get around to agreeing with our 
Republican friends on the need for just 
providing the billions and billions of 
dollars that have already been appro-
priated and is just sitting there. We 
don’t want to make that available be-
cause we have got all these important 
things. 
Like last week and this week, all 
these important things: 
Let’s see, we took care of saving the 
lives of ceiling fans this week. So that 
apparently was very critical. 
And, last week, we knew that people 
were 
suffering 
immeasurably 
from 
COVID, and rather than, again, helping 
with funding, we took up a marijuana 
bill that will provide tax incentives 
and actually some money and some as-
sistance in getting marijuana going 
stronger nationally. It wasn’t a bill 
that said that we are going to let the 
States decide for themselves. It was a 
Federal bill to really push not medical 
marijuana, but just marijuana. 
So the answer, according to the ma-
jority, to COVID and businesses going 
bankrupt is just smoke some dope and 
you won’t be nearly as anxious about 
the loss of your business, the suffering 
of your family, and the isolation of our 
senior citizens. 
I have had senior citizen places of 
residence directors just weep every day 
as they see the seniors not able to 
spend time with their families, in iso-
lation. 
b 1300 
We didn’t address any of that, but we 
did take care of making dope available 
through the bill—at least the House 
has so far. It is doubtful the Senate 
will take those things up. And we also 
voted to take care of—as I understand, 
it just pertains to one place—where ti-
gers are kept. 
But as my friend Dr. DESJARLAIS 
pointed out—he was looking at the 
numbers—and in the time that it took 
in this Chamber to vote on that bill, 
there were more people that died of 
COVID than have died from tigers in 
the last 25 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I know there are dis-
agreements on priorities. Apparently, 
there was a need felt to do this bill to 
address the need of tigers, but we still 
left the needs of those dying from 
COVID, and businesses that are dying 
because of the restrictions, we left all 
of that undone to take care of ceiling 
fans, tigers, marijuana. 
Mr. Speaker, we could get a bill done 
rather quickly. And I understand we 
should have had a bill done 2 years 
ago—it would have been easy to make 
it bipartisan—on funding infrastruc-
ture. We desperately need to upgrade 
our infrastructure. According to most 
engineers and studies, we have like a 
D-minus grade on American infrastruc-
ture. But my understanding for why we 
have not done a bill in the last 2 years 
that the Democrats have been in the 
majority here in the House, has been a 
fervent 
desire 
to 
avoid 
President 
Trump getting any credit for anything 
that really helps America. Despite that

desire of some, he has gotten an amaz-
ing amount accomplished. 
So I am hoping that we can come to-
gether rather quickly—hopefully, by 
Monday—and we can pass a bill that at 
least makes available the tens of bil-
lions of dollars that is just sitting 
there waiting for authorization to be 
provided to businesses that are in trou-
ble. And we could do that quite easily. 
In fact, we have got a bill that my 
friend, Mr. CHABOT from Ohio, had filed 
as the ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Small Business, and it would 
make the money available. 
We have had our colleague, JAIME 
BEUTLER—I 
am 
missing 
the 
last 
name—but it is a discharge petition. 
Everybody needs to come down and 
sign it—I think, nearly all the Repub-
licans have—saying, let’s bring this to 
the floor. Let’s make this money avail-
able. Hopefully, that will happen, but 
it hasn’t happened yet. 
Mr. Speaker, but all of that, as des-
perately serious, critically serious as it 
is, is still, when we look at the future 
of this country, the issue that stands 
behind the importance of having a free 
and fair election, because if you can’t 
have that, the Republic ceases. We be-
come a totalitarian government, so-
cialist government—of course, that is a 
bit redundant. You can’t have social-
ism without having a totalitarian gov-
ernment. And actually, what has often 
been referred to as a Communist Gov-
ernment, like in China, the Chinese 
Communist Party, the Soviet Union, 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Repub-
lics, they really weren’t communists. 
We always refer to them as the com-
munists, but communism doesn’t exist 
if there is a government. True com-
munism is where the government fades 
away, everybody shares and shares 
alike. 
But we have seen, historically, when 
a rather sad life of a person named 
Marx, following up on Engels, came up 
with this idea. He was completely 
wrong. He didn’t foresee the rising of a 
middle class such as we have had here 
in the United States. Anybody that 
didn’t foresee that and try to concoct a 
form of government without foreseeing 
that is not somebody that should be 
followed. 
And just as Dostoevsky said—and 
Solzhenitsyn 
quoted 
him 
in 
‘‘The 
Gulag Archipelago’’—in Dostoevsky’s 
case, he was speaking theoretically. In 
Solzhenitsyn’s case, having spent many 
years in a Gulag, in a Russian prison, 
he was speaking not theoretically or 
hypothetically, but pragmatically from 
having been the victim of the govern-
ment. But Dostoevsky said the problem 
with socialism is not economic. The 
problem is socialism is atheism. You 
cannot have a true socialist govern-
ment unless the government becomes 
God. 
And there is no place for the one liv-
ing God that our—nearly all of the 
Founders 
acknowledged. 
Even 
Ben 
Franklin—who is sometimes said to be 
a deist, which he clearly wasn’t—said 
in his autobiography that he was 
moved to the contrary over a discus-
sion about deism. But he made very 
clear he believed in God, he believed 
that divine providence, God’s provi-
dence controlled things. And that is 
not a deist, for those that haven’t stud-
ied deism. 
Mr. Speaker, nonetheless, we are in 
grave danger. And if the Supreme 
Court does not take up and resolve this 
dispute over whether or not we will 
continue to have a Democratic-Repub-
lican form of government, then it will 
cease, and there will not be another 
Republican elected because of the cir-
cumstances that have arisen. And I 
will address that further. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend 
from Texas (Mr. FLORES). 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF EDYTHE 
KENGLA SWANN 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the 100th birthday of Edythe Kengla 
Swann. 
Edythe was born on December 5, 1920, 
in Tucson, Arizona, to Herman Kengla 
and Joaquina Robles Kengla. She is a 
descendant 
of 
Arizona’s 
pioneering 
ranching and railroad families. 
Since childhood, Edythe was instilled 
with a pioneering spirit. Her grand-
father, Bernabe Robles, was an immi-
grant from Mexico who established a 
stagecoach shop in Arizona that ulti-
mately became the Robles Ranch in 
the mid-1880s. The ranching complex 
ultimately comprised over one million 
acres, making it one of the largest 
ranches in Arizona. 
Edythe graduated from the Univer-
sity of Arizona in 1941 with a degree in 
home economics. As the United States 
entered World War II, more women 
were being called upon to fill jobs that 
were previously held by men. Edythe 
was determined to take advantage of 
the new opportunities opening around 
her. Enamored by the possibility of 
travel, Edythe became a flight attend-
ant for American Airlines. 
Flight 
attendant 
school 
was 
an 
immersive environment of rigorous 
training in a multitude of subjects. 
Edythe became well-versed in the tech-
nical side of flying. She excelled in me-
teorology and was well-prepared for 
difficult 
emergencies 
during 
flight. 
Edythe also took great interest in the 
maintenance of the DC–3 aircraft and 
was very knowledgeable about the 
inner workings of many cockpit sys-
tems. 
Edythe diligently worked to meet in-
dustry expectations and create an at-
mosphere that eased the concerns of 
her passengers while promoting the 
airline industry. She loved being a pio-
neer in a profession that represented 
new opportunities to women and al-
lowed them to find freedom through 
adventure. 
While Edythe was stationed with 
American Airlines in El Paso, she met 
Richard Earnest Swann, a lieutenant 
in the Army stationed at Fort Bliss. 
Edythe and Richard quickly fell in love 
and were married in 1945. At the time, 
airlines required that flight attendants 
be unmarried, so Edythe made the dif-
ficult choice to leave behind her be-
loved career for her new future as a 
wife and a mother. 
Together, Edythe and Richard raised 
five children and started their own 
business, representing lamp and home 
furnishing manufacturers in Dallas, 
Texas. Edythe worked hard to assist 
her husband at the store while raising 
their children and becoming an active 
member 
of 
their 
community. 
She 
served as a precinct chairman and was 
an avid volunteer at her church for 
local events. 
In 2017, Edythe was widowed after 72 
years of marriage. Together, Richard 
and Edythe had 5 children, 12 grand-
children, and 15 great-grandchildren. 
Today, Edythe remains independent 
in mindset and in ability. Her pio-
neering spirit and moral resolve con-
tinue to serve as an inspiration to her 
family. 
Edythe Kengla Swann’s life story ex-
emplifies the opportunity afforded to 
descendants of immigrants who pursue 
challenging careers that help this 
country grow and whose self-deter-
mination and commitment to family 
help to maintain the strength of Amer-
ican culture. 
Mr. Speaker, Edythe Kengla Swann 
has lived a long life filled with joy, 
love, and above all, a pioneering spirit. 
I am proud to recognize her on this joy-
ous occasion and know that her family 
and friends love her and are proud of 
her. I wish Edythe many more years of 
health and happiness in the future. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for their country 
during these difficult times for our 
military men and women who protect 
us from external threats and for our 
first responders who protect us here at 
home. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope all Americans 
have a great holiday season and a very 
happy and joyous Christmas. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my Aggie friend and appreciate that 
shout-out to what sounds like an in-
credible lady. 
Mr. Speaker, my friend will be 
missed here in Congress. We have had 
some disagreements, but I know his 
heart and I know he has always wanted 
what is best for the country. And I 
greatly appreciate that heart. 
Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should have 
gotten more than two hours sleep last 
night. I was thinking ‘‘Jaime Beutler 
Herrera’’ but it didn’t sound right. It is 
JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER. 
Mr. Speaker, she has a discharge pe-
tition, and I hope that if there is any 
Republican that has not signed onto 
JAIME’s discharge petition that they 
will come do that as soon as possible. 
We need to get that money. It has al-
ready been appropriated. It is just sit-
ting there. Why could we not agree on 
that? 
I know that Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER, I 
know Mr. CHABOT, they would be fine if

the Democrats put somebody else’s 
name on what they have done. That is 
fine. Put Democrat names on it, but 
let’s get it done. We are more con-
cerned about helping people that need 
the money after having their busi-
nesses shut down, curtailed, cut back. 
Let’s get that money to them, and I 
hope that we will. 
With regard to this election, on the 
one hand, you have got COVID that is 
killing people. On the other hand, you 
have fraud that is killing a nation. And 
we know it is serious because YouTube 
did 
everything 
they 
could—as 
did 
Google and Twitter—to censor the pub-
lic dialogue about different types of 
fraud, investigations into the Biden 
family. They did everything they could 
to hurt President Trump and to help 
candidate Biden. 
Now we see today, YouTube is going 
to start preventing any discussion 
about fraud. So we know it is serious 
when YouTube has to take the position 
as the totalitarian censor—basically, 
fascist censor, that the high-tech in-
dustry has chosen to be—that they are 
going to eliminate anybody’s ability 
using their public forum to discuss the 
facts of fraud. 
And for those networks that say that 
they are unfounded, they need to pull 
their heads out of the orifice, hole in 
the ground, whatever, in which their 
heads are stuck because there have 
been hundreds and hundreds of affida-
vits. There are thousands of examples 
of fraud in the elections. 
And as John Fund said, the biggest 
fraud about elections is the statement 
‘‘there is no fraud in elections.’’ It is 
not new. It has just never, ever, any-
where in the history of the world, been 
utilized in so many ways and with so 
many ballots as it has been in this 
election. 
b 1315 
We have seen the gutless actions of 
some courts, some places that have re-
fused to take up critically important 
issues that will mean this country has 
a future as a republic or will end that 
future and move us into the socialism 
that brings totalitarianism. But they 
refuse to take it up. 
You can understand, if you have no 
courage, then you would rather not 
take up an issue that might make some 
people mad, even though, as I figured 
out early in my career as a judge, if I 
was going to run from the job I ran for, 
I shouldn’t even be there. 
Most judges haven’t figured that out. 
Some are appointed, but they were ap-
pointed after they sought those posi-
tions. Well, if you are going to run 
from the job you sought, you shouldn’t 
have that job. Just be honest and car-
ing enough for the country that if you 
don’t have the guts to do the job, re-
sign and go. You can mediate. You can 
arbitrate. 
There is great money in arbitration. 
I had gone through the 3 days of study 
and testing by the only institute at the 
time that prepared people for inter-
national arbitration. There was great 
money in it. But at the same time, I 
was told by a Member of Congress, now 
is the time you need to start raising 
money. 
Do I start raising money to run for 
Congress, or do I pursue the extremely 
lucrative 
and 
rewarding 
career 
in 
international arbitration? Well, I took 
the road less traveled by, and that has 
made all the difference. Not a fun dif-
ference, but this is an important job. 
The judiciary is an important job. 
So, after the court refused to take up 
MIKE KELLY’s suit—totally legitimate, 
should have been taken up—we have a 
lawsuit that was filed a couple of 
nights ago by the Texas attorney gen-
eral. It is styled State of Texas v. Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania, State of 
Georgia, State of Michigan, and State 
of Wisconsin, so four defendants. 
As Article III of our Constitution 
says: ‘‘In all cases affecting Ambas-
sadors, other public ministers and con-
suls, and those in which a State shall 
be party, the Supreme Court shall have 
original jurisdiction. In all the other 
cases before mentioned,’’ which is up in 
the first part of Section 2, ‘‘the Su-
preme Court shall have appellate juris-
diction, both as to law and fact, with 
such exceptions, and under such regu-
lations as the Congress shall make.’’ 
But this is a case, as the Constitution 
says, where the Constitution provides 
for original jurisdiction in the Su-
preme Court. That means you don’t go 
to a lower court—not a magistrate, not 
a district judge, not a court of ap-
peals—but you go straight to the Su-
preme Court. 
Now, I had filed things before in the 
Supreme Court, but I had never filed an 
original action. I didn’t realize until 
this week that on something the Su-
preme Court is said by the Constitu-
tion to have original jurisdiction, you 
can’t just file. You have to come in and 
beg: Oh, please, please, Mount Zion 
judges, please allow me leave so I can 
file this petition because you have 
original jurisdiction over this con-
troversy, according to Article III of our 
Constitution. 
Apparently, the Supreme Court has 
previously decreed that if you want to 
file an original action, according to the 
Constitution, in our Court, you have to 
come in and beg us for leave to file 
such an original action. We may or 
may not let you file that lawsuit, even 
though the Constitution makes clear it 
should be, it has to be, originally in 
our Court and no other. 
So, the State of Texas, by and 
through its attorney general, filed this 
action. But they start by filing a mo-
tion for leave to file bill of complaint. 
So, that is what they filed. They go 
through the motions of doing what is 
required. Then, we get to the page that 
says ‘‘Motion for Leave to File Bill of 
Complaint,’’ and it sets out—I am not 
going to read the whole thing, but I 
think it is important that people un-
derstand exactly what is involved here. 
‘‘As set forth in the accompanying 
brief and complaint, the 2020 election 
suffered from significant and unconsti-
tutional irregularities in the defendant 
States: 
‘‘Nonlegislative 
actors’ 
purported 
amendments to States’ duly enacted 
election laws, in violation of the Elec-
tors Clause’s vesting State legislatures 
with plenary authority regarding the 
appointment of Presidential electors.’’ 
In other words, the Constitution 
makes clear the State legislatures 
shall determine the appointment of the 
electors for that State as part of the 
electoral college and nobody else. Not 
a judge, not a State or Federal judge, 
not a commissioner, not a secretary of 
state, not a Governor, but the legisla-
ture has to make that call of the State. 
‘‘Intrastate differences in the treat-
ment of voters, with more favorable al-
lotted to voters—whether lawful or un-
lawful—in areas administered by local 
government under Democrat control 
and with populations with higher ra-
tios of Democrat voters than other 
areas of defendant States. 
‘‘The appearance of voting irregular-
ities in the defendant States that 
would be consistent with the unconsti-
tutional relaxation of ballot-integrity 
protections in those States’ election 
laws.’’ 
Those are three points made as to 
why this election suffered from uncon-
stitutional 
irregularities 
in 
those 
States that have been sued. 
All of these flaws, even the violations 
of State election law, violate one or 
more of the Federal requirements for 
elections. That includes equal protec-
tion, due process, the Electors Clause, 
and thus arise under Federal law. 
So, it is not just that the Supreme 
Court, under our Constitution, clearly 
has the original jurisdiction over this 
suit where a State sues another State 
or States, but this involves a Federal 
question. In case some on the Supreme 
Court are asleep or do not understand 
their obligation, it is a Federal ques-
tion as well as being a State versus 
State. 
In Bush v. Gore in 2000, the Court 
said: ‘‘Significant departure from the 
legislative scheme for appointing Pres-
idential electors presents a Federal 
constitutional question.’’ 
The plaintiff, the State of Texas, ‘‘re-
spectfully submits that the foregoing 
types of electoral irregularities exceed 
the hanging-chad saga of the 2000 elec-
tion in their degree of departure from 
both State and Federal law. Moreover, 
these 
flaws 
cumulatively 
preclude 
knowing who legitimately won the 2020 
election and threaten to cloud all fu-
ture elections.’’ 
I hope the Supreme Court—well, I 
know some of the Justices will take 
particular interest and give attention 
to that. This is for the future of the 
Republic. 
As Eric Metaxas points out in his 
book, quoting from Franklin, when he 
was asked, what have you given us? 
after the Constitutional Convention in 
1787 in Philadelphia. He replied: A re-
public, Madam, if you can keep it.

H7143 
December 10, 2020 
I think the title of Eric’s book is ‘‘If 
You Can Keep It.’’ 
Well, the answer will be determined 
in this case. If the Supreme Court re-
fuses to take it up and do their job, 
then the answer is, we kept it from 1789 
until 2020. Then, because we had people 
in States that didn’t do their job, or 
overzealously became partisan and al-
lowed 
circumstances, 
even 
partici-
pating in circumstances, to permit 
fraud and to destroy the election proc-
ess. 
Any Republican that thinks, ‘‘Oh, 
well, if I sound good, and I don’t stand 
up for the Constitution here, then I 
will be in good stead to be the Repub-
lican nominee. Then, I can win the 
Presidency in 2024,’’ the news for those 
people is, if this fraud in this election 
is not addressed and these unconstitu-
tional schemes are not struck down by 
the highest court in the country, there 
is not going to be a Republican elected 
again. It is not going to happen. 
So, it is rather important. History 
will judge us accordingly. From the 
looks of what the Supreme Court did to 
Congressman KELLY’s case, in refusing 
to take it up, there is grave concern, 
appropriately, that the Supreme Court 
is not going to do their jobs, that they 
will choose to go down in history as 
the Supreme Court that allowed this 
Nation to lapse as a republic. 
There were rumors that the Chief 
Justice 
flipped 
his 
vote 
in 
the 
ObamaCare case because he became 
very sensitive to the allegation that if 
ObamaCare was overturned, he would 
become the most political Chief Jus-
tice since Taney in the Dred Scott 
case. The rumor was that he flipped 
and chose to uphold that decision, 
making him the most political Chief 
Justice in American history, probably 
more so than Taney. 
In Taney’s case—regardless of how 
you pronounce it—in that case, that 
decision helped pave the way for the 
Civil War because the Supreme Court 
did not do their job in protecting the 
rights listed in the Constitution in the 
Bill of Rights. Likewise, this country 
is headed for some very dire times if 
the Supreme Court doesn’t resolve this 
controversy 
and 
the 
fraud 
that 
underlies it. 
Again, for those that say there was 
no fraud, wake up, look at the evi-
dence. There is sworn testimony. There 
is video footage. 
Another thing that people need to 
understand about the judicial system, 
it is not a new idea that one party to 
a suit would have possession of evi-
dence that would show that party 
should lose the lawsuit. That has hap-
pened throughout jurisprudence. 
Over the years, in the common law, a 
doctrine, a legal doctrine, developed 
called spoliation. The doctrine is basi-
cally this: If one party is in possession 
of evidence, or possesses the capacity 
to preserve evidence, and they mix that 
evidence in with other evidence that 
prevents a party from being able to 
show that it should win the day, then 
that doctrine of spoliation can be uti-
lized. 
If there is a jury which is the fact- 
finder, the judge can tell the jury that 
it may consider the fact that the de-
fendant in this case had possession of 
documents that would either prove or 
disprove the plaintiff’s case, and since 
the defendant refuses to produce them 
or put them in a manner that they 
could not be identified or destroyed 
them, then you may consider that that 
evidence supported the plaintiff’s case. 
b 1330 
And you can even take judicial no-
tice, a court can, of a situation like 
that. The Supreme Court could take ju-
dicial notice of that, that one party 
has the evidence that will prove the 
plaintiff’s case, and they refuse to 
allow it to be found; or, as we saw in 
Pennsylvania, we had a Supreme Court 
order to preserve evidence, and the 
eight actors in Pennsylvania basically 
ignored the order so they could con-
tinue to hide evidence. That should be 
evidence and should have judicial no-
tice taken that that evidence is the 
fact that they continue to hide what 
would have proved the plaintiff’s case. 
So, as the brief says, taken together, 
these flaws affect outcome determina-
tive numbers of popular votes in a 
group of States that cast outcome de-
terminative 
numbers 
of 
electoral 
votes. This Court—and I am talking 
about the Supreme Court since they 
have 
original 
jurisdiction—should 
grant leave to file the complaint and 
ultimately enjoin the use of unlawful 
election results without review and 
ratification by the defendant States’ 
legislatures and remand the defendant 
States’ respective legislatures to ap-
point Presidential electors in a manner 
consistent with Electors Clause, and 
pursuant to 3 U.S.C. section 2. 
So that is the motion for leave to 
file. 
And then we get to the bill of com-
plaint that Texas is seeking to have 
permission to file. 
Oh, please, oh, most holy Supreme 
Court, please, lower yourselves to 
allow us to be heard before your Court 
of original jurisdiction. Please, oh, 
please. 
How many times do we need to say it 
to affect the high and mighty Supreme 
Court? 
Well, the bill of complaint actually 
has an appropriate quote from John 
Adams: ‘‘That form of government, 
which is best contrived to secure an 
impartial and exact execution of the 
laws, is the best of republics.’’ And 
that is exactly what we will be losing if 
we do not preserve the integrity of this 
election. 
The bill of complaint goes on to say: 
‘‘Our country stands at an important 
crossroads. Either the Constitution 
matters and must be followed, even 
when some officials consider it incon-
venient or out of date, or it is simply a 
piece of parchment on display at the 
National Archives. We ask the Court to 
choose the former. 
‘‘Lawful elections are at the heart of 
our 
constitutional 
democracy. 
The 
public, 
and 
indeed 
the 
candidates 
themselves, have a compelling interest 
in ensuring that the selection of a 
President—any 
President—is 
legiti-
mate. If that trust is lost, the Amer-
ican Experiment will founder. A dark 
cloud hangs over the 2020 Presidential 
election. 
‘‘Here is what we know. Using the 
COVID–19 pandemic as a justification, 
government officials in the defendant 
States of Georgia, Michigan, and Wis-
consin, and the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania . . . usurped their legis-
latures’ authority and unconstitution-
ally revised their State’s election stat-
utes. They accomplished these statu-
tory revisions through executive fiat or 
friendly lawsuits, thereby weakening 
ballot integrity. Finally, these same 
government officials flooded the de-
fendant States with millions of ballots 
to be sent through the mails, or placed 
in drop boxes, with little or no chain of 
custody and, at the same time, weak-
ened the strongest security measures 
protecting the integrity of the vote— 
signature verification and witness re-
quirements.’’ 
And I might inject here, in the State 
of Georgia, on Saturday night, being 
there 
with 
the 
President, 
DAVID 
PERDUE, KELLY LOEFFLER, and so many 
other wonderful Georgia officials—and 
I do love the State of Georgia. It 
seemed like I spent 20 years there be-
cause I was in the Army, but my 4 
years at Fort Benning, I grew to love 
the people of Georgia. We still have 
many great friends in the State, so it is 
always a pleasure to have an excuse to 
go back to Georgia. 
That was a rough time in our history. 
People did not appreciate those of us 
that wore the uniform. We didn’t have 
it as bad as those who had recently 
come back from Vietnam, but it was a 
very unpleasant time to be in uniform. 
There were times when we were or-
dered not to wear it; yet, generally, the 
people of Georgia were just superb. 
I was there and Vernon Jones showed 
me an envelope he had gotten from 
America Votes, sometimes referred to 
as Stacey Abrams’ group, but it had a 
return address on the envelope here in 
Washington, D.C., and apparently they 
sent out millions of these requests for 
absentee ballots. 
It seemed like something like that 
ought to be reserved to a governmental 
entity so that those are not sent to 
people who shouldn’t be getting them, 
that government ought to update their 
records and make sure they are not 
sending them to dead people or to peo-
ple who have been moved to other 
States, other jurisdictions for 40 years, 
as we have already heard in some 
cases. 
There was all this information about 
absentee ballots and pushing the re-
cipient to fill it out, send it in, and 
even a postage-paid envelope was pro-
vided, which provides something of 
value to somebody for them to send in 
that absentee request.

December 10, 2020 
But I just thought: Wow. So Wash-
ington, D.C., has gotten involved in the 
State of Georgia’s election in trying to 
skew the vote there. It is really inter-
esting. 
But getting back to this complaint 
by the State of Texas, it says: ‘‘The 
only date that is mandated under the 
Constitution is . . . January 20, 2021, 
U.S. Constitution Amendment 20. 
‘‘Against that background, the State 
of Texas . . . brings this action against 
defendant States based on the fol-
lowing allegations: 
‘‘1. Plaintiff State challenges defend-
ant States’ administration of the 2020 
election under the Electors Clause of 
Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, and the 
14th Amendment of the Constitution. 
‘‘2. This case presents a question of 
law: Did defendant States violate the 
Electors Clause, or, in the alternative, 
the 14th Amendment, by taking—or al-
lowing—nonlegislative 
actions 
to 
change the election rules that would 
govern the appointment of Presidential 
electors? 
‘‘3. Those unconstitutional changes 
opened the door to election irregular-
ities in various forms. Plaintiff State 
alleges that each of the defendant 
States flagrantly violated constitu-
tional rules governing the appointment 
of Presidential electors. In doing so, 
seeds of deep distrust have been sown 
across the country. In the spirit of 
Marbury v. Madison, this Court’s at-
tention is profoundly needed to declare 
what the law is and to restore public 
trust in this election. 
‘‘4. As Justice Gorsuch observed re-
cently: ‘‘Government is not free to dis-
regard the Constitution in times of cri-
sis. . . . Yet, recently, during the 
COVID pandemic, certain States seem 
to have ignored these long-settled prin-
ciples.’’ 
That is in the case of Roman Catho-
lic Diocese of Brooklyn, New York v. 
Cuomo, a case from 2020. The petition 
or the complaint says that this case is 
no different now. 
‘‘5. Each of the defendant States 
acted in a common pattern. State offi-
cials, sometimes through pending liti-
gation, for example, settling ‘friendly’ 
suits, and sometimes unilaterally by 
executive fiat, announced new rules for 
the conduct of the 2020 election that 
were inconsistent with existing State 
statutes defining what constitutes a 
lawful vote. 
‘‘6. Defendant States also failed to 
segregate ballots in a manner that 
would permit accurate analysis to de-
termine which ballots were cast in con-
formity with the legislative set rules 
and which were not. This is especially 
true of the mail-in ballots in these 
States by waiving, lowering, and other-
wise failing to following the State stat-
utory requirements for signature vali-
dation and other processes for ballot 
security, the entire body of such bal-
lots is now constitutionally suspect 
and may not be legitimately used to 
determine allocation of the defendant 
States’ Presidential electors.’’ 
I interject here. A good example, and 
this also brings in the doctrine of spo-
liation, where, in Georgia, you had peo-
ple lie to get people out of the area in 
which ballots were being counted, and 
then once they were all out and there 
was no big water leak, there may have 
been a slight leak in a commode, but 
they were moved out. You can see the 
video. But then out from under tables 
comes suitcases full of ballots that 
these people who are unwatched to en-
sure that these were legitimate ballots, 
they started running them through and 
counting them. 
Well, my understanding is they have 
refused to make those ballots available 
for examination. And that is where 
spoliation comes in. They have got the 
evidence; they refuse to produce it; so 
the presumption should be made by the 
Supreme Court, if those ballots were 
produced by the people who have sole 
control over them, they would prove 
the plaintiff’s case; therefore, plain-
tiff’s case is proven and the results are 
no longer viable and valid. 
The complaint goes on: ‘‘Each of the 
defendant States acted in a common 
pattern.’’ 
I touched on that. 
‘‘7. The rampant lawlessness arising 
out of defendant States’ unconstitu-
tional acts is described in a number of 
currently pending lawsuits in defend-
ant States or in public view including: 
‘‘Dozens of witnesses testifying under 
oath about the physical blocking and 
kicking out of Republican poll chal-
lengers; thousands of the same ballots 
run multiple times through tabulators; 
mysterious late night dumps of thou-
sands of ballots at tabulation centers; 
illegally backdating thousands of bal-
lots; signature verification procedures 
ignored’’—and I would interject, and 
those put in batches where it could not 
be determined what signatures came 
with that ballot. That ought to lead to 
spoliation evidence—‘‘signature verifi-
cation procedures ignored; more than 
173,000 ballots in the Wayne County, 
Michigan, center that cannot be tied to 
a registered voter; 
‘‘Videos of: poll workers erupting in 
cheers as poll challengers are removed 
from vote-counting centers; poll watch-
ers being blocked from entering vote- 
counting centers—despite even having 
a court order to enter; suitcases full of 
ballots being pulled out from under-
neath tables after poll watchers were 
told to leave. 
b 1345 
‘‘Facts for which no independently 
verified reasonable explanation exists: 
On October 1, 2020, in Pennsylvania, a 
laptop and several USB drives used to 
program Pennsylvania’s Dominion vot-
ing machines were mysteriously stolen 
from a warehouse in Philadelphia. The 
laptop and the USB drives were the 
only items taken, and potentially 
could be taken to alter vote tallies; in 
Michigan, which also employed the 
same Dominion voting system, on No-
vember 4, 2020, Michigan election offi-
cials have admitted that a purported 
‘glitch’ caused 6,000 votes for President 
Trump to be wrongly switched to 
Democratic candidate Biden. A flash 
drive containing tens of thousands of 
votes was left unattended in the Mil-
waukee tabulations center in the early 
morning hours of November 4, 2020, 
without anyone aware it was not in a 
proper chain of custody. 
‘‘8. Nor was this court’’—talking 
about the Supreme Court—‘‘immune 
from the blatant disregard for the rule 
of law. Pennsylvania itself played fast 
and loose with its promise to this 
court. In a classic bait and switch, 
Pennsylvania used guidance from its 
Secretary of State to argue that this 
Court should not expedite review be-
cause the State would segregate poten-
tially unlawful ballots. A court of law 
would reasonably rely on such a rep-
resentation. Remarkably, before the 
ink was dry on the court’s 4–4 decision, 
Pennsylvania changed that guidance, 
breaking the State’s promise to the Su-
preme Court.’’ 
In the October 28, 2020, decision, it 
said: ‘‘We have been informed by the 
Pennsylvania Attorney General that 
the Secretary of the Commonwealth 
issued guidance today directing county 
boards of elections to segregate late- 
arriving ballots.’’ 
Well, it turns out they lied to the Su-
preme Court. And if the Supreme Court 
will not have at least enough self-re-
spect to call down a State that lies to 
the Court to get a ruling they want, 
then that is one worthless court. 
It is the same problem we have had 
with the FISA courts and why I want 
to eliminate them. They didn’t even 
have enough self-respect that when 
they found out they were lied to in a 
number of manners in order to get a 
warrant to spy on the Trump cam-
paign, they didn’t get upset. They 
didn’t put anybody in jail. They didn’t 
hold anybody in contempt. A court 
that worthless needs to be eliminated. 
As my law school professor, David 
Gwynne, used to say, you know, every 
Federal court in America, except for 
one, owes its existence and jurisdiction 
to the U.S. Congress. That, of course, 
the Supreme Court. We brought them 
into the world, we should be able to 
take them out. And that should happen 
when they don’t even have enough self- 
respect to enforce the truthfulness re-
quired to make that court operate. 
In 
Republican 
Party 
versus 
Boockvar, November 6, 2020, a quote 
from that decision: ‘‘This court was 
not informed that the guidance issued 
on October 28th, which had an impor-
tant bearing on the question whether 
to order special treatment of the bal-
lots in question, had been modified.’’ 
That was from Justice Alito. 
‘‘10. The probability of former Vice 
President Biden winning the popular 
vote in the four defendant states— 
Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and 
Wisconsin—independently given Presi-
dent Trump’s early lead in those States 
as of 3 a.m. on November 4, is less than

one in a quadrillion, or one in’’—well, I 
am not even sure what that number is. 
Maybe quadrillion. I guess that is 15 
zeros. ‘‘For former Vice President 
Biden to win these four states collec-
tively, the odds of that event hap-
pening decreased to less than one in a 
quadrillion to the fourth power. 
‘‘13. By purporting to waive or other-
wise modify the existing State law in a 
manner that was wholly ultra vires and 
not adopted by each State’s legisla-
ture, defendant States violated not 
only the electors clause, but also the 
elections clause, to the extent that the 
Article I elections clause textually ap-
plies to the Article II process of select-
ing Presidential electors. 
‘‘14. Plaintiff States and their voters 
are entitled to a Presidential election 
in which the votes from each of the 
States are counted only if the ballots 
are cast and counted in a manner that 
complies with the preexisting laws of 
each State. The President and vice 
president of the United States are the 
only elected officials who represent all 
the voters in the Nation. Voters who 
cast lawful ballots cannot have their 
votes diminished’’—or the term we 
have heard over the last 4 years, disen-
franchised—‘‘by States that adminis-
tered their 2020 Presidential elections 
in a manner where it is impossible to 
distinguish a lawful ballot from an un-
lawful ballot. 
‘‘15. The number of absentee and 
mail-in ballots that have been handled 
unconstitutionally in defendant States 
greatly exceeds the difference between 
the vote totals of the two candidates 
for President of the United States in 
each defendant State. 
‘‘16. In addition to injunctive relief 
for this election, plaintiff State seeks 
declaratory relief for all Presidential 
elections in the future. This problem is 
clearly capable of repetition, yet evad-
ing review. The integrity of our con-
stitutional democracy requires that 
States conduct Presidential elections 
in accordance with the rule of law and 
Federal constitutional guarantees. 
So that is critical. 
‘‘18. In a Presidential election, ‘the 
impact of the votes cast in each State 
is affected by the votes cast for the 
various candidates in other States.’’’ 
That is in the Anderson case, 460 U.S. 
at 795. 
‘‘The constitutional failures of de-
fendant States injure plaintiff States 
because ‘the right of suffrage can be de-
nied by a debasement or dilution of the 
weight of a citizen’s vote just as effec-
tively as by wholly prohibiting the free 
exercise of the franchise.’’’ 
And that is from Bush versus Gore. 
In any event, Mr. Speaker, it is crit-
ical that the Supreme Court step up 
and take the jurisdiction that the Con-
stitution requires it to take. It won’t 
be fun and it won’t be pleasurable, but 
it is absolutely essential that the U.S. 
Supreme Court do what the Constitu-
tion created them to do, take up this 
matter with which it has original juris-
diction and determine there were un-
constitutional actions taken that af-
fected the outcome of this election. It 
was not a free and fair election, and if 
the Supreme Court does not act accord-
ingly, then, really, the Supreme Court 
is irrelevant, Congress is irrelevant; 
and those who would seek to hide bal-
lots in the future, create improper bal-
lots, count ballots multiple times, they 
will control the future of this country, 
not the Supreme Court, not Congress, 
but a newfangled electronic—not just 
electronic. They used every method 
known to man. It will make Tammany 
Hall, and has made Tammany Hall, 
look like Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. 
It is time to act. It is time preserve the 
Republic. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Virginia 
(Mr. 
RIGGLEMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today, after 2 years of service, to ad-
dress this Congress for perhaps the last 
time. I rise today humbled by the op-
portunities granted to me by this great 
country and the citizens of the Fifth 
District. That I could go from living on 
food stamps decades ago to serving in 
this hallowed body is a testament to 
the American Dream and the oppor-
tunity provided by this land of liberty. 
I would be remiss if I did not begin 
this address by thanking my beautiful 
wife, Christine, and my three daugh-
ters, Abby, Lauren, and Lily, for their 
support throughout this journey. I 
married Christine fresh out of high 
school at the age of 19, and she has 
been my rock ever since. And to have 
my two new granddaughters in Wash-
ington, D.C., with me today is an over-
whelming blessing. 
I never intended to enter politics or 
subject my family to the challenges 
and strains that accompany public life, 
but they have taken on every challenge 
and continue to inspire me every day. 
I have spent most of my life in serv-
ice to this country as an enlisted and 
commissioned airman in the United 
States Air Force and working for and 
with intelligence community and De-
partment of Defense organizations. I 
served in the Balkans during Operation 
Allied Force, spent time in the Middle 
East, and deployed immediately after 9/ 
11 as part of a team that mission 
planned the first bombing runs into Af-
ghanistan. 
I was taken away from my family in 
service to the country I love. And while 
my family is with me now, I know that 
they made countless sacrifices to help 
me get to this point. 
Though my time in this Chamber will 
be shorter than I may have hoped, I am 
proud of what we have accomplished. 
Just 2 weeks ago, this House passed 
H.R. 2466, the State Opioid Grant Au-
thorization Act of 2020. A bill that 
might seem like a footnote in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD to some can save 
countless lives. One of my priorities 
during my time in Congress has been 
addressing the very real crisis of opioid 
addiction, which has devastating con-
sequences for families across this great 
Nation. 
I was sitting at my desk in Congress 
about 1 year ago when I got the call 
that my cousin, Trey, had overdosed 
not far from where I was sitting. 
I talked about this with my friend 
and 
colleague, 
Congressman 
DAVID 
TRONE, the Democratic party lead on 
the State Opioid Response Grant Au-
thorization bill and the leader of the 
Freshman Working Group on Addic-
tion. He had lost a nephew, Ian, to the 
scourge of addiction. We knew that 
something had to be done, and we came 
together in a bipartisan way to accom-
plish something great. 
A special thanks to Representatives 
SHERRILL and ARMSTRONG for their in-
credible support on this legislation. 
Trey and Ian, we worked to honor 
your memories and to help those who 
might not be able to help themselves. 
During my time in Congress, I have 
worked to expand access to broadband 
internet in rural areas, especially in 
those remote areas of the Fifth Dis-
trict. Our rural communities need 
broadband access to keep up with the 
demands of the modern economy. Clos-
ing the digital divide is critical in en-
hancing economic opportunity, job cre-
ation, access to healthcare, and edu-
cation in rural America. 
My district carries history matched 
by few in this Nation. The first rep-
resentative 
from 
my 
district 
was 
James Madison. I have used his legacy 
to guide me in my fight to protect con-
stitutional principles, and I believe 
that his example is one that can guide 
all representatives in this body. 
James Madison said this: ‘‘A well in-
structed people alone can be a perma-
nently free people.’’ 
I internalized that statement into a 
baseline for carrying out the duties as 
a representative of the people, duly 
elected by the citizens of Virginia’s 
Fifth District. My background as a vet-
eran and Air Force intelligence officer 
employed at times by the National Se-
curity Agency and working with other 
government agencies taught me the 
value of honor, service, and integrity 
in all I do. It also taught me the in-
valuable lesson of considering the 
source when evaluating information 
from my colleagues and constituents 
and when fighting radicalization and 
disinformation campaigns. 
James Madison also stated 
that 
‘‘knowledge will forever govern igno-
rance; and a people who mean to be 
their own governors must arm them-
selves 
with 
the 
power 
knowledge 
gives.’’ 
A well instructed people and a knowl-
edgeable people—pillars of a working 
republic. Those pillars are now being 
assaulted by disinformation and out-
landish theories surrounding this Pres-
idential election.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7146 
December 10, 2020 
As we transition to a new adminis-
tration, I implore all to consider the 
sources of information you receive, to 
fact-check diligently and to recognize 
that many bad actors who spread spu-
rious and fantastical conspiracy theo-
ries under banners like QAnon, Kraken, 
Stop the Steal, Scamdemic, and many 
other emotive terms and coded lan-
guage are not disseminating informa-
tion rooted in knowledge, but with 
questionable motives. They are rooted 
in misunderstanding or fraud or, in 
some cases, ignorance. 
b 1400 
To all those on the end of the 
disinformation firehose, please know 
that I am you and you are me. 
Unbiased, fact-based information sus-
tains our republic. My objective in 
serving my district was never to judge 
others, because all of us are only 
human. None of us has a special dis-
pensation to rule over another. 
We are common in our belief that the 
Constitution stops the tyrannical en-
croachment of a man, woman, or group 
claiming to have some extraordinary 
knowledge that allows them insights 
that we as individuals cannot attain. 
Disinformation hinders our free ex-
change of ideas and creates super- 
spreader digital viruses that create a 
fever of nonsense. 
Disinformation operations can at-
tack specific pillars of democracy at 
strategic 
moments: 
from 
belief 
in 
democratic elections, to trust in public 
health and public institutions. In tech-
nical terms, sophisticated influence op-
erations using combinations of bot- 
like-networks and synchronous mass 
posting behavior, termed ‘‘coordinated 
inauthentic behavior,’’ is a tactic, a 
tactic which disinformation peddlers 
such as QAnon community members 
use with great success to hijack the na-
tional conversation. 
My 
2 
decades 
of 
intelligence, 
warfighting, and counterintelligence 
experience coupled with serving in the 
116th Congress is why I will not allow 
conspiracy peddlers to hijack our abil-
ity to conduct reasonable policy dis-
cussions for the betterment of all 
Americans. 
Just like creating a vaccine to eradi-
cate COVID–19, we must work together 
to inoculate against the social con-
tagion of disinformation, conspiracies, 
anti-Semitism, dehumanization, rac-
ism, deep state cabal nonsense, cults, 
and those grifters posing as servants of 
the people. 
Big data, machine learning, and 
facts-based analysis are the ingredients 
for our digital vaccine. If we build that 
vaccine, we can encourage facts over 
fantasy, people over politics, love over 
hate, and unity over division. 
I am now serving on the board of a 
nonpartisan organization that will uti-
lize advanced analysis, data meth-
odologies, and network modeling to 
track 
disinformation 
over 
social 
media. 
If you are in the grifting and propa-
ganda business, know that I am not 
going anywhere. 
As I go back to my incredible life on 
50 acres in the Blue Ridge Mountains, I 
can reflect on how I conducted myself 
in Congress. 
My dear friend, Congressman KEVIN 
BRADY from Texas, told me he appre-
ciated that I ‘‘called balls and strikes’’ 
even when it was not advantageous to 
me. To be clear, KEVIN BRADY is an ex-
ample of that service and what calling 
balls and strikes looks like. So let me 
call three pitches right now. 
First, 
I 
will 
always 
fight 
disinformation wherever I see it, hear 
it, or watch it. For those who spread 
disinformation, know that I will not 
stop in tracking those who push false-
hoods 
onto 
decent 
Americans. 
Radicalization through disinformation 
has no place in the United States, and 
in this fight, I will not relent. 
Second, working together for the bet-
terment of the American people in a bi-
partisan way is not a bug, it is a fea-
ture. 
Third, people are more important 
than party. Pandering is a political 
sickness. 
As I reflect on the accomplishments 
we have made for the Fifth District, I 
am moved to recognize some of the 
many people who have made these ac-
complishments possible. 
Esther 
Page 
and 
Denise 
Van 
Valkenburg are dedicated public serv-
ants who served the Fifth District from 
before my time in office. Regardless of 
the party affiliation of the Representa-
tive, they served the people of the 
Fifth District of Virginia exception-
ally, and they should be lauded for 
their efforts. 
To Jim Pomeroy, Steve Harvey, and 
Josiah Leonard, your service has not 
gone unnoticed. 
It was never my plan to be a politi-
cian, so I should thank my staff for 
helping me to learn this process and do 
my best to serve the Fifth District. 
Dave Natonski, who served as my 
chief of staff through good times and 
bad, was an invaluable asset and friend. 
My current chief of staff, Haley 
Brady, is as competent as she is great. 
A big thank you to my legislative 
team, without whom the legislative ac-
complishments could not have hap-
pened: Borden Hoskins, a financial 
services savant with as devastating a 
wit as a pen; Eli Woerpel, my right 
hand on everything broadband and ag-
ricultural; 
Jason 
Eagleburger, 
my 
friend and confidante, who spearheaded 
the China Task Force and helped with 
complex 
policy 
issues; 
Nicole 
Nentwich, who was my go-to for 
healthcare policy; and Lexi Klein, who 
my Fifth District constituents love and 
appreciate. 
To my communications team, thank 
you for your sound advice and constant 
guidance. 
Joe Chelak has been with me since I 
started my run for Congress, and his 
strategic leadership has been invalu-
able to my success. 
Kate Currie has made the most of her 
time in my office and exhibited incred-
ible talent. 
And to Ben Mullany, without whom I 
would not have gotten this far, thank 
you. 
Jimmy Keady, thank you for talking 
me into this craziness, and your leader-
ship and guiding me through this beau-
tiful and treacherous passage. 
Chris Woodfin, thank you. Your 
counsel has been invaluable. 
To the Cloakroom, thank you for 
putting up with me these last 2 years. 
And to my congressional colleagues, 
where there are far too many to name 
and thank, know that I am not far 
away. I am always available for a snort 
of bourbon, a tipple of irreverence, and 
a nod to Bigfoot. 
In January of next year, the Fifth 
District of Virginia will be represented 
by a new Member, who I hope will heed 
these lessons: that service to your dis-
trict should be your priority; courage 
in the face of disagreement should be 
lauded, not ignored; and to always re-
member the strength of holding to 
your principles will last far longer than 
any allegiance to a position or a party. 
There is an incredible dart game 
scene in the show ‘‘Ted Lasso’’ where 
Ted is vastly underestimated in a darts 
competition and ends up besting an ar-
rogant opponent, a former owner of the 
soccer team that Ted coaches. Please 
watch that scene. In that scene, Ted 
quotes Walt Whitman: ‘‘Be curious, not 
judgmental.’’ 
Let’s not throw hyperbolic darts at 
each other. Let’s rely on facts and 
compassion. Let’s listen together and 
move this country forward together. 
May God bless the Commonwealth of 
Virginia, may God bless this Congress, 
and may God bless the United States of 
America. 
And for the last time, Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time.

PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE 116th CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION
∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.
.
S7379 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 2020 
No. 209 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Have compassion upon us, Mighty 
God, for we are weak. We strive to do 
good but too often miss the mark. 
Without Your strength, we would sure-
ly stumble and fall. 
Rescue our lawmakers from those 
things that aren’t contributing to Your 
glory. Give them the good sense to lis-
ten to Your guidance and obey Your 
precepts. 
Lord, use our Senators to plant and 
water seeds that will bring a harvest of 
healing, hope, and humility to our Na-
tion and world. 
Thank You for hearing and answer-
ing our prayers, for You are always our 
refuge and strength. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
BIDEN INVESTIGATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
want to remind people of how Senator 
JOHNSON and I have been attacked over 
the months of 2020 for some investiga-
tion we have been doing, and I want to 
speak to that now. 
For over a year, Senator JOHNSON 
and I investigated the Biden financial 
family dealings. We found that they en-
gaged in potential criminal financial 
deals across the globe, including China, 
which created counterintelligence con-
cerns. 
We showed our work, and we made 
our findings very public, but the liberal 
media and members of the other polit-
ical party chose to dismiss our work. 
They even falsely claimed that our 
work was Russian disinformation. I 
think they did this in order to protect 
leaders of the other party. Those same 
liberal outlets that disparaged our in-
vestigation now report that Hunter 
Biden’s financial deals in China raised 
counterintelligence concerns. 
Yesterday, the Biden transition team 
confirmed that Hunter Biden is under 
criminal investigation for his taxes and 
financial dealings. 
So you can understand why I think it 
is very outrageous that the Fourth Es-
tate would choose to ignore facts when 
they are uncovered by Republicans. 
Senator JOHNSON and I don’t do over-
sight work just for the fun of it. Over-
sight work is serious business. It 
shouldn’t take subpoenas and con-
firmation from Hunter Biden himself 
to get the rest of the press to pay at-
tention. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
we learned a few minutes ago that new 
unemployment claims just hit their 
highest weekly total since mid-Sep-
tember. It is the largest 1-week jump 
since back in March, and the number of 
continuing claims—people struggling 
with joblessness on an ongoing basis— 
which had plateaued for months but at 
least not increased, just ticked back up 
as well. 
Our economic recovery thus far has 
been faster than expected. Americans 
are tough and resilient, but our people 
need another dose of support as we 
hope to close out our battle with this 
virus. We should be doing everything 
we can to prevent layoffs, create jobs 
where possible, and race toward the 
vaccines that will end this nightmare. 
While Democrats hold the Paycheck 
Protection Program hostage over con-
troversial State government bailouts, 
family businesses are closing their 
doors. While Democrats resist the 
kinds of commonsense legal protec-
tions that we put in place during past 
emergencies, our reopening and recov-
ery is threatened by, according to one 
estimate—now, listen to this: So far, 
6,500 lawsuits have been filed and 
counting—6,500 
lawsuits 
filed 
and 
counting. 
Here is what one litigator told one 
reporter a couple of days ago. These 
lawsuits are ‘‘pretty common these 
days. I have seen 10 like this over the 
last 30 days.’’ 
The American Council on Education 
told Congress in May—in May—that 
colleges and universities need tem-
porary but strong legal protections. 
Now, our Democratic colleagues want 
to pretend they are bravely fighting 
big corporations, but they are really 
bullying small business owners and col-
lege presidents who have been pleading 
for these protections for months. 
Our Democratic colleagues have not 
even 
let 
us 
pass 
noncontroversial 
money to invest in vaccine distribu-
tion—not unless the two parties settle 
a whole list of issues that are con-
troversial the way that they want to 
settle. 
So I hope our colleagues let Congress 
deliver more help soon. A lot of Ameri-
cans simply cannot afford to wait.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7380 
December 10, 2020 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORITIZATION ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, in the meantime, yesterday, we 
began moving the conference report on 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act toward the floor. 
For the information of all Senators, 
we should expect the potential for a 
late night tonight and the possibility 
of votes tomorrow. 
Back in July, the Senate passed our 
version of this crucial annual bill. Now 
our colleagues on the conference com-
mittee have done their tough job and 
reconciled two different approaches so 
we do not leave our military in the 
lurch. 
On Tuesday, the House passed the 
conference report with overwhelming 
bipartisan support. Now it is the Sen-
ate’s turn to make it an unbroken 60- 
year streak of passing this legislation 
to keep our military strong and our 
homeland safe. 
This NDAA will unlock more than 
$740 billion for the training, tools, and 
cutting-edge equipment that our serv-
icemembers and civilian employees 
need to defend American lives and 
American interests. It will give our 
troops the 3 percent pay raise they 
richly deserve. It will keep our forces 
ready to deter China and stand strong 
in the Indo-Pacific, and it will secure 
President Trump’s major progress at 
modernizing our capabilities, our tech-
nologies, and our strategic nuclear de-
terrent. 
This legislation will secure wins on 
priorities that all of us share. It does 
not contain every policy that either 
side would like to pass, but a huge 
number of crucial policies are included, 
and a lot of bad ideas were kept out. So 
I would encourage all our colleagues to 
vote to advance this must-pass bill. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO CORY GARDNER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, on one final matter, it is my 
honor today to pay tribute to a truly 
exceptional U.S. Senator, someone who 
arrived in this body with a full head of 
steam and a determination to cram as 
much service as possible into every day 
he got to wake up and serve his neigh-
bors who sent him here. 
Our good friend, CORY GARDNER, the 
junior Senator from Colorado, has been 
a man on a mission from the day he ar-
rived. He already knew the institution. 
He was already one of the highest en-
ergy high-achievers that anybody who 
knew him had ever met. So he got to 
work, and he spent 6 years delivering a 
dizzying list of accomplishments. 
If you have heard about CORY GARD-
NER’s early days, you know that his 
high-speed, can-do attitude is nothing 
new. Case in point, one evening, when 
CORY was a boy, he and his friends got 
tired of their hoop sessions ending at 
sundown because the public basketball 
court lacked sufficient lighting. The 
group of friends considered how to rem-
edy this. CORY’s dad happened to be a 
town councilman. So a little govern-
ment relations took place right around 
the dinner table. 
Well, no Senator who CORY
ever 
pressed for a vote will be surprised to 
hear that the lighting infrastructure 
was soon adjusted, and the kids could 
take their pickup games into prime 
time. 
So young CORY was no stranger to 
persistence or public service, but it was 
in high school that he scored an oppor-
tunity to taste a level beyond Yuma’s 
local government. He won admission to 
the U.S. Senate Youth Program. It is a 
scholarship that brings promising stu-
dents from around the country to these 
halls for a quick immersion experience. 
Teenaged CORY GARDNER liked the 
looks of this place. He made a mental 
note. By the way, to this day, CORY, 
along with his fellow alumna, Senator 
COLLINS, continue to make sure that 
special experience is paid forward. 
It didn’t take CORY long to come 
back and begin strolling these hallways 
for real. After earning honors at Colo-
rado State and a law degree from CU 
Boulder, he wound up working for our 
former 
colleague 
Senator 
Wayne 
Allard—and rising quickly through the 
ranks. 
In short order, he developed a reputa-
tion as a highly effective advocate for 
Coloradans. In fact, he was so well 
liked, so effective, and so thoroughly 
the proud son of Yuma that folks start-
ed to wonder if it wasn’t time for CORY 
to put his own name on a door some-
where. So it wasn’t long before the men 
and women of Colorado’s State House 
District 63 found out firsthand what 
happens when you hire CORY GARDNER 
to fight on your behalf. You get results 
big time. 
Not much later, his neighbors then 
gave CORY a new assignment here in 
Congress. Again, Congressman GARD-
NER didn’t just meet the bar as one out 
of 435. He excelled as a powerful, ener-
getic voice on the most consequential 
issues. He brought home one win after 
another when it really mattered. 
It didn’t take long before another 
promotion came calling, and so, appro-
priately enough, the Senate’s freshman 
class of 2014 included a new member 
from the land of ‘‘14ers’’—what Colo-
radans call their peaks higher than 
14,000 feet. CORY was already accus-
tomed to altitude. 
So here in this upper Chamber, Sen-
ator GARDNER hit the ground sprinting. 
I believe he has authored 11 standalone 
bills that have been signed into law in 
just 6 years. Without CORY’s tireless 
work and his travels to the four cor-
ners of Colorado and beyond, the big-
gest conservation bill in a generation— 
the Great American Outdoors Act— 
would not have become law. 
There has been his key role in the 
Supreme Court confirmation of fellow 
Coloradan Neil Gorsuch, his mission to 
move the Bureau of Land Management 
to Grand Junction, and, of course, the 
nuts-and-bolts constituent work that 
CORY and his staff are famous for mas-
tering. 
This not-so-junior Senator has used 
Colorado values to improve Wash-
ington and Washington influence to ad-
vance his home State. 
He dived head first into his leader-
ship role on the East Asia Sub-
committee on Foreign Relations. His 
work with regional allies helped drive 
the Senate to approve meaningful sanc-
tions against North Korea, and the im-
pact of the Asia Reassurance Initiative 
should echo long after all of us here 
today have left this scene. 
The litany of CORY’s work just sim-
ply does not end. There is the new, na-
tionwide three-digit suicide prevention 
hotline. There is the fact that this 
freshman not only scrapped over a na-
tional defense issue with our late col-
league Chairman John McCain—talk 
about fearlessness—but that he some-
how emerged mostly unscathed and 
with a win on space launch vehicles to 
show for it. 
But, like I said, one of the best as-
pects of CORY’s operation is his almost 
obsessive focus on looking out for his 
people—one family and one story at a 
time. 
That is why it is impossible to give a 
speech on Senator GARDNER without 
working your way to another name, 
Don Stratton. 
When Don was first met with our col-
league, the 95-year-old Navy veteran 
was living with his wife in Colorado 
Springs. But the story began 76 years 
earlier, when he was among the fortu-
nate few sailors to survive the bombing 
of the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor. 
At 19, Don had survived severe burns 
but insisted on returning to combat 
with the fleet. After the war, he raised 
a family and wrote a book about his ex-
periences. But Don’s request to Sen-
ator GARDNER wasn’t anything for him-
self. It concerned a comrade who had 
saved his life that day 79 years ago this 
very week. 
At risk to himself, a sailor named 
Joe George had literally thrown the 
lifeline that brought Don and five ship-
mates to safety. But Joe’s lifesaving ef-
forts had gone unrecognized before his 
death. 
For years, Don didn’t even know who 
had saved him. So once he found out, 
Don Stratton made it his mission to 
ensure our Nation formalized our grati-
tude for his guardian angel. 
Let’s just say that the Strattons 
picked the right State to retire in. 
Colorado’s junior Senator was on the 
case. CORY and his staff waded through 
tangles of bureaucracy. They appealed 
decisions all the way to the Secretary 
of Defense. And you better believe they 
secured that Bronze Star for PO1 Joe 
George, with the ‘‘V’’ device for valor 
to boot. 
Don passed away earlier this year. By 
all accounts, he and his family had 
come to regard Senator GARDNER not 
just as an incredible advocate but as a 
true friend. 
Now, in fairness, this same eagerness 
and almost maniacal problem-solving

can also get CORY in the occasional 
pickle. I remember recently that just 
months after the Senator was sworn in, 
he and I were on a codel together in the 
Middle East. I think the itinerary was 
something like eight countries in 6 
days. 
At one point, we were waiting to 
meet with a foreign leader. As every-
one else was just waiting patiently in 
this grand palace, CORY
spots what 
looks like a stray piece of paper lying 
on the floor. Earnestly thinking he 
should leave the place better than he 
found it, CORY bends over and picks up 
the trash—except, it wasn’t trash. Just 
then, the Monarch rolls in with a color 
guard—a color guard that is looking 
anxiously for the floor marker that 
was supposed to indicate where to stop 
marching. Luckily, the only diplo-
matic fallout was a good laugh by all. 
Actually, good laughs tend to follow 
CORY in his wake. Our colleague finds 
humor in the ‘‘everyday’’ like few can 
and shares it freely. 
I understand one of his favorite sto-
ries concerns a chat in the well with 
yours truly and former Senator Orrin 
Hatch. CORY was filling me in on his ef-
forts to legalize marijuana in States 
like his. Orrin comes by, and sensing 
an ally, I pulled him in. I said: 
Orrin, is this true? What the heck is going 
on out West? 
Without missing a beat, our friend 
from Utah, a member of the LDS 
Church, shook his head sadly and said: 
‘‘First, it was tea. Then, coffee. And 
now this!’’ 
CORY’s version of this story comes 
complete with his finest Hatch and 
McConnell impersonations. Believe me, 
he has the voices down pat. 
For 6 years, Coloradans have been 
represented by this remarkable person 
who lives and works with relentless 
focus and infectious joy: globe-trotting 
diplomacy, a thick stack of signature 
bills signed into law, and generational 
accomplishments that were only pos-
sible because he was here. 
CORY likes to say himself: ‘‘Not bad 
for a boy from Yuma, CO!’’ We know 
what he means, but I have to observe 
that CORY’s roots and his accomplish-
ments are not in conflict—quite the 
contrary. It is only because CORY 
GARDNER is exactly who he is that he is 
able to do what he does. 
CORY, everyone knows darn well your 
transition is no ‘‘retirement.’’ This is a 
brief pause between great chapters. I 
bet Jaime will call it a victory if she, 
Alyson, Thatcher, and Caitlyn can just 
get you to sit still—just sit still—and 
stay home through the holidays. 
But we all know it will take about 5 
minutes before you have found a dozen 
new ways to keep doing big things, 
winning victories on behalf of others, 
and paying forward the ways in which 
you have been blessed. Colorado and 
your country aren’t finished with you 
yet, not by a long shot. So thank you 
for everything. We will miss you badly 
around here, but we can’t wait to see 
what course you chart next.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The

OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
with each passing day, we get another 
round of news underscoring how costly 
this pandemic has been. Yesterday, 
over 3,000 Americans—3,000—died from 
COVID–19, the highest single-day death 
toll to date. 
If you were making a list of some of 
the deadliest days in American history, 
your mind would jump to Gettysburg, 
Antietam, Pearl Harbor, or 9/11. You 
can now add to that somber list last 
Thursday, Wednesday, last Tuesday, 
last Friday, and yesterday. Each day, 
nearly 2,500 Americans or more lost 
their lives to COVID in the course of a 
single day. 
Now time is running out for Congress 
to finish our most pressing priority: 
passing an emergency COVID relief bill 
to help American families in need. 
Right now, there is one clear path to 
getting an outcome: a bipartisan group 
of Senators and House Members who 
have reached an initial agreement on 
another emergency relief bill. In the 
spirit of compromise and for the sake 
of getting something done for the 
American people, Speaker PELOSI and I 
have endorsed those efforts as a frame-
work for a final bill. 
Everyone knows that this bipartisan 
proposal is the only real game in town 
at the moment, the only proposal with 
enough bipartisan support to, hope-
fully, pass both Houses of Congress be-
fore the end of the year. Everyone 
knows that, it seems, except Leader 
MCCONNELL, who continues to stand in 
the way of bipartisan progress and who 
seems to wake up each morning with a 
new round of outlandish reasons why 
Democrats are somehow to blame for 
all the world’s ills. 
As the bipartisan group of Senators 
continue to work toward a final agree-
ment, I want to address an incredibly 
false equivalency that has been drawn 
between two provisions: providing aid 
to State and local services—essential 
State and local services—and granting 
sweeping immunity to corporations 
that put their workers in harm’s way 
during the pandemic. 
You will hear voices say: Democrats 
want to fund State and local services 
while 
Republicans—that 
is, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL—want a corporate liability 
shield. Each side wants something that 
the other side doesn’t want to accept. 
But as I said, this is a false equiva-
lency, incredibly false, for two reasons. 
First, State and local aid has broad 
bipartisan support, totally unlike the 
Republican leader’s liability provision, 
which is expressly partisan. Let me say 
that again because it is important. 
There is strong bipartisan support for 
State and local aid. There is not the 
same broad bipartisan support for 
sweeping corporate immunity. 
Second, the two policies are not re-
motely equivalent in terms of impor-
tance or relevance to what is going on 
in our country right now. When we talk 
about providing Federal aid so the 
States don’t have to cut essential serv-
ices, we are talking about saving lives, 
and we are talking about saving jobs. 
We are talking about boosting the 
economy. According to the Congres-
sional Budget Office, money for State 
and local government creates the best 
bang for the buck for the economy 
from any spending Congress is consid-
ering. 
State and local aid is a policy with a 
nationwide reach. It would solve a real, 
immediate problem. On the other hand, 
when Republicans talk about giving 
corporate indemnity, they are talking 
about a solution in search of a prob-
lem. To date, there have been 20—only 
20-some-odd personal injury lawsuits 
filed in the entire country. 
The bottom line is, one provision 
solves a real problem in our country; 
the other does not. The two sides are 
not remotely equivalent, and it is not a 
trade that makes any sense in terms of 
the well-being of the American people. 
Now, I know the Republican leader 
and Senate Republicans want to help 
small businesses and re-up the popular 
PPP to help prevent businesses from 
folding and American workers from 
being laid off. So do I. So do Demo-
crats. Well, guess what. State and local 
relief is also about American workers

getting laid off too. If you want PPP so 
small businesses don’t lay off people, 
why wouldn’t you want State and local 
aid so governments don’t lay off peo-
ple? They are the same people who 
need to feed their families, pay their 
rent, pay their mortgage, and get on 
with life. 
State and local relief is about Amer-
ican workers getting laid off. It is 
about firefighters getting laid off. It is 
about first responders getting laid off. 
It is about teachers getting laid off, 
busdrivers, sanitation workers, essen-
tial employees—men and women who 
have been working since the pandemic 
began and risking their lives to keep 
our country moving. It is impossible to 
imagine any community in this coun-
try functioning without them. 
And this morning we learned that an 
additional 1.4 million Americans filed 
new unemployment claims—a huge 
spike from the previous week. If you 
want to save jobs, if you want to make 
sure those numbers don’t go up, we 
need PPP for small businesses, and we 
need State and local aid for our govern-
ments because both aid those entities 
and prevent people from being laid off 
and unemployment from going up. 
The liability provisions of the leader 
have nothing to do with that and in 
fact only affect a very small number of 
lawsuits. 
So if we are going to be here on the 
floor and talking about saving jobs, we 
have to talk about saving the jobs of 
essential public employees. They de-
serve our help too. They are no dif-
ferent than anyone else, whether they 
are in a red State or a blue State. 
Make no mistake, right now there is 
one person—just one person—standing 
in the way, and that is Leader MCCON-
NELL. 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
Madam President, now on another 
matter, despite the fact that the Presi-
dential election ended well over a 
month ago and that, by now, every sin-
gle State in the country and the Dis-
trict of Columbia has certified results, 
there are still many on the political 
right who refuse to accept reality. 
Today, amazingly enough, 17 Repub-
lican attorneys general will meet with 
President Trump to discuss their des-
perate and wildly irresponsible lawsuit, 
which aims to literally overturn the 
will of the people on the grounds they 
didn’t like the results. 
This has gone beyond ridiculous. No 
court in this country has found any of 
President Trump’s claims of wide-
spread voter fraud credible. No serious 
State election official, Democrat or 
Republican, has found them credible. 
Even the Trump administration’s Jus-
tice Department, so browbeaten into 
political activities over the past 4 
years, has not found a scrap of evidence 
that would affect the final result. 
Yet, rather than accept the simple 
truth that Joe Biden will be the next 
President of the United States, there 
are actually sitting Senators and Con-
gress Members who prefer to under-
mine 
our 
democracy 
by 
indulging 
President 
Trump’s 
wild 
conspiracy 
theories about a stolen election. 
Here in the Senate, the chairman of 
the Homeland Security Committee an-
nounced yesterday that next week he 
will convene a hearing on ‘‘election 
irregularities.’’ When is this nonsense, 
detrimental to our democracy, going to 
end? When? 
It is already deeply irresponsible for 
my Republican colleagues, many of 
them, to stay silent about President 
Trump’s deliberate attempts to poison 
Americans’ faith in our elections. It is 
deeply irresponsible that there hasn’t 
been a full-throated defense of the va-
lidity of our elections by Republican 
Senators and the Republican leader, 
who still refuse to call Joe Biden 
‘‘President-Elect.’’ But to go one step 
further and use a Senate committee as 
a platform to spread misinformation 
about our own elections is beyond the 
pale. 
So, in conclusion, Chairman JOHNSON 
should call off this ridiculous charade 
of a Senate hearing immediately. If he 
won’t, Leader MCCONNELL should inter-
vene to ensure that the committee does 
not indulge such quackery and con-
spiracy theories, and he should ac-
knowledge the results of the election 
and make clear it is time to move on, 
just as he was happy to do so when the 
shoe was on the other foot. Doing oth-
erwise would add fuel to the fire that is 
undermining faith in our wonderful de-
mocracy. 
TRIBUTE TO PAT ROBERTS 
Madam President, finally, just a 
note: I, too, want to bid a fond, fond 
farewell to the Senator from Kansas, a 
wonderful guy and a great guy. 
I learned how good he was when we 
met on the basketball courts in the 
House. He set the best picks of any-
body. He would quietly sneak up on 
you, you would be dribbling or moving, 
and boom. He knows. 
But as good as he was at picks, he 
was very fine at legislating, and he is 
just a fine human being whom I think 
just about every Member on this side of 
the aisle will very much miss. 
So, PATTY, we wish you and your 
family the very, very best. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The dis-
tinguished Senator from Kansas. 
FAREWELL TO THE SENATE 
Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, my 
colleagues, first, I thank the leadership 
on both sides for this opportunity to 
give a PAT ROBERTS ‘‘adios, amigos’’ 
speech. 
The story of how I got into politics is 
a pretty straight family path. As a 
fourth-generation Kansan, my great- 
grandfathers on both sides of the Rob-
erts-Patrick family were pioneer news-
paper editors who came to Kansas as 
crusading abolitionists. To say I bleed 
fourth-generation printer’s ink would 
be very close to the truth. 
However, the main influence that 
drew me to public service was my dad, 
Wes Roberts, who was a newspaper 
man. And soon journalism led to poli-
tics. He served as chief of staff and ad-
viser for several Kansas Governors, be-
coming then the State Republican 
chairman. 
In 1952, my dad was asked to head up 
the Citizens for Ike campaign, which 
was a genuine army of volunteers made 
up of legions of veterans, women’s 
groups, and mostly Republicans who 
wanted a candidate who could win. 
Plus, they really liked Ike. 
At 16, in my dad’s tow, I was the ser-
geant at arms at the 1952 convention, 
back when conventions actually chose 
the nominee for President. I vividly re-
member two lasting experiences: The 
renowned Senator from Illinois, Ever-
ett Dirksen, was a key leader in the 
Bob Taft campaign. Senator Dirksen, 
known for his long, eloquent speeches, 
was in the midst of his convention re-
marks when the entire New York dele-
gation, led by former Governor and 
Presidential candidate Tom Dewey, 
marched in, and with considerable 
noise they took their seats. 
Dirksen paused and, pointing directly 
at Dewey and with his booming voice, 
said this: You, sir, have led this party— 
this Republican Party—down to defeat 
in 1944 and again in 1948. Don’t do it 
again. 
Whereupon, the entire New York del-
egation stood up and gave Dirksen the 
raspberry, and I thought: This is what 
adults do at a convention? 
(Laughter.) 
One morning I was in a meeting with 
my dad with the top Ike campaign 
brass—Dewey, Lodge, Brownell, and 
other GOP movers and shakers. He told 
me to sit and be quiet. He was in the 
midst of suggesting the ‘‘fair play’’ 
amendment, given that the new Ike 
delegates from the solid South had sur-
prised the old guard and won delegate 
seats at the State convention, only to 
be replaced by the old guard at later 
surprise 
conventions. 
Unlike 
Mac-
Arthur, old guards never die or fade 
away. 
My dad said there was no downside if 
they lost, and he believed they could 
win a majority of delegates. The ‘‘fair 
play’’ amendment passed, and Ike won 
on the first ballot. I thought to myself: 
Wow. My dad actually helped Ike win. 
I met the general. I shook his hand— 
and then again at the 1953 inaugural 
ceremonies when my dad became the 
Republican national chairman. 
It was these reflections, told to my 
great friend and Medal of Honor recipi-
ent 
Senator 
Danny 
Inouye, 
that 
prompted him to say: PAT, I fought for 
Ike. You met him. It is up to you to get 
this memorial done. 
And after a 21-year effort, we did just 
that, with help from Bob Dole, Jim 
Baker, Susan Eisenhower, the Eisen-
hower family, and Senator LISA MUR-
KOWSKI, who kept the Ike commission 
going through these tough years. Fi-
nally, we now have an appropriate, if 
not stunning, memorial to the Kansan 
who saved Western democracy and 
World War II and led America onto the 
world stage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7383 
December 10, 2020 
With the final dedication of the 
Dwight David Eisenhower Memorial at 
the end of my Senate career, it is a full 
family-circle accomplishment. If my 
dad helped elect Ike, then the least I 
could do was to lead the effort to make 
the memorial on the Mall to a great 
general and President a reality. 
In a homecoming address, Eisen-
hower famously said: ‘‘The proudest 
thing I can claim is that I am from Ab-
ilene.’’ He was a small-town Kansas 
boy who saved Western democracy and 
led the Nation for 8 years with peace 
and prosperity. 
Well, I too come from a small town in 
Kansas. So how did this boy from Hol-
ton, KS, become the longest serving 
Member of Congress in Kansas history? 
Like father, like son. I graduated from 
K-State with a degree in journalism. 
My father joined the Marines in World 
War II and saw action in both Okinawa 
and Iwo Jima. I joined in peacetime 
and served in Okinawa and was part of 
the first Marine contingent to return 
to Iwo Jima on the 15th anniversary of 
that battle. 
So from Marine captain to newspaper 
editor and news director of a radio sta-
tion in Arizona, I dropped everything 
and drove to Washington when Senator 
Frank Carlson asked me to come and 
work for him. Within weeks of leaving 
Phoenix, I was the chief of staff for 
Senator Frank Carlson, a venerable 
and highly respected Senator who 
made his mark on Kansas history as 
the only person to serve our State as 
Congressman, Governor, Senator, UN 
delegate, and the founder of the Na-
tional Prayer Breakfast. 
Life changed dramatically at that 
time. I always thought a bachelor was 
a man who did not make the same mis-
take once. 
(Laughter.) 
Then into my life came a tall, blonde, 
blue-eyed 
magnolia 
blossom 
from 
South Carolina. Franki and I have been 
married for 51 years and have been 
blessed with three children and eight 
grandchildren. I am who I am because 
Franki is my wife and we are parents 
to David, Ashleigh, Ann Wesley; Papa 
PAT to Lorena, Patrick, Sayaka, Lilly, 
Charlie—Charlie bear—Miles, Oliver, 
and Graham. 
My 
family 
is 
my 
crowning—my 
crowning—achievement. 
Senator Frank was a great mentor. 
He always said: There are no self-made 
men or women in public office; it is 
your friends and family who make you 
what you are. 
He taught me a great lesson: Your 
true friends stand behind you when you 
are taking the bows and beside you 
when there are any boos. 
Following the 2-year stint with the 
Senator, I was privileged to work 12 
years for the newly elected Congress-
man from the big First District of Kan-
sas as his chief of staff. 
Keith Sebelius was a wonderful man, 
a leader on the House Agriculture Com-
mittee and the Interior Committee, es-
pecially with regard to improvements 
and restoration of our national parks. 
Upon Keith’s retirement, a group of 
party stalwarts encouraged me to run. 
I thought about it, talked to Franki. 
Franki simply said: Well, this is what 
you always wanted to do. Let’s do it. 
So for 9 months, with no paycheck or 
health insurance and limited savings, 
with three young children, Dodge City 
became our home. Most sane can-
didates would not attempt to go door- 
to-door in a district larger than most 
States; however, with a lot of help, we 
won a tough primary and a not-so- 
tough general election—the first of 24 
straight victories. 
I was ranking to Chairman Kika de la 
Garza when the 1994 revolution put Re-
publicans in the majority after being in 
the wilderness for over 40 years. Sud-
denly I was chairman. 
In 1996, we achieved a major farm 
policy reform, changing 40 years of 
farm bill policy. To this day, farmers 
still have the freedom to farm what 
they want. 
I have had the honor and privilege of 
representing Kansas for 16 years in the 
House and now 24 in the Senate. The 
PAT ROBERTS of 1980 was fighting for 
Kansas values and for the issues that 
affected the daily lives and pocket-
books of all Kansans. 
As the PAT ROBERTS of 1996, I prom-
ised that if elected to the Senate, when 
Kansas spoke, Washington would lis-
ten. 
I have held six gavels in the House 
and Senate, and that in and of itself 
might be a record, but it is what hap-
pened during my tenures as chairman 
that I believe I have had the most last-
ing effects. It is not just having the 
gavel; it is what you do with it. 
Taking part and leading eight farm 
bills in the House and the Senate, I 
have touched and improved many lives, 
and I have always been mindful of what 
farm families do for our Nation and a 
troubled and hungry world as we craft-
ed each bill. 
I was fortunate that my first com-
mittee assignments were to serve on 
the Armed Services Committee as well 
as Agriculture. Strom Thurmond was 
the very senior chairman who, as the 
country song goes, never even called 
me by my name. I was recognized as 
‘‘the Senator who had the good sense to 
marry a fine, beautiful, South Carolina 
girl.’’ 
(Laughter.) 
My role on the Armed Services Com-
mittee was simple. It was to collect the 
small change left by the Air Force to 
enable the Marine Corps to continue to 
be our Nation’s force in readiness, not 
to mention the new Warfighting Lab. 
I also had the privilege of being the 
Senate Intelligence Committee chair-
man for 4 years during the Iraq war and 
led the committee’s investigation that 
exposed a worldwide intelligence fail-
ure—and it resulted in a blueprint of 
the 9/11 Commission and a better intel-
ligence community that did keep our 
country safe. 
As chairman of the brandnew Emerg-
ing Threat Subcommittee within the 
Armed Services Committee, I traveled 
to cities within what remained of the 
former Soviet Union. In one of the So-
viet Union secret cities, we discovered 
a lab that had developed strains of 
pathogens that could do irreparable 
harm to our Nation’s food supply. Talk 
about an evil empire. I caution my col-
leagues: That threat still exists, even 
as we endeavor to continue the world-
wide fight against COVID–19. 
It has taken over 20 years to respond 
to this threat with a biological con-
tainment and research lab, and we are 
still not done. I have put a lifetime of 
work into NBADF, the National Bio 
and 
Agriculture 
Defense 
Facility— 
Paws from Manhattan, KS—home of 
Kansas State University with the ever 
optimistic Wildcats, Manhattan, KS. It 
will soon serve as the first line of de-
fense to protect American agriculture 
and the world’s food supply. 
I have also been privileged to serve 
on the HELP Committee. Thank you to 
LAMAR ALEXANDER and to PATTY MUR-
RAY for supporting my amendments, 
especially 
with 
regard 
to 
rural 
healthcare. 
And, finally, I have chaired the Sen-
ate Ethics Committee for 24 years. I 
have tried to resign twice. I don’t know 
what I have done wrong, but I have 
been a member of that committee for 
what I am sure is a record 24 years. I 
think they just want somebody there 
to say: Wait a minute. Fifteen years 
ago, we tried that, and it didn’t work. 
Maybe we ought to start over. 
As I move out of my office—formerly 
a 
veritable 
museum 
of 
pictures, 
awards, and stuff that we all collect— 
all that remains are the barren beige 
walls, full of memories and stories—all 
of which, of course, are classified. How-
ever, I still have my Marine Corps 
bumper sticker: ‘‘To err is human, to 
forgive is divine.’’ Neither is Marine 
Corps policy. Marines never give up. 
We take the hill. The discipline and 
focus I learned in the Marine Corps 
never failed me in my toughest battles 
here in the Senate. Semper fi. Semper 
fi, Dan. And still in the office, of 
course, is a framed statement with the 
advice of LBJ, Lyndon Baines Johnson: 
‘‘Sometimes you just have to hunker 
down like a jackass in a hailstorm and 
just take it.’’ 
On that note, if you want to avoid a 
hailstorm, get a good staff. You are 
only as good as your staff—and I have 
the best staff in Washington. I know 
everybody thinks that, but I really do 
because they always—they always took 
the hill. 
My chiefs of staff, Leroy Towns, 
Jackie Cottrell, and Chad Tennpenny; 
my DC deputy chief of staff, Amber 
Kirchhoefer; and my Ag Committee 
staff directors, Mike Seyfert, Joel 
Leftwich, and James Glueck—they led 
the posse. And they always checked to 
make sure that the herd was still there 
and we didn’t ride into any boxed can-
yons.

ber with me, and those watching on C–

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7384 
December 10, 2020 
SPAN, thank you. It has been an abso-
lute privilege and an honor to have you 
call me boss. Always remember you are 
a family. I couldn’t have asked for a 
more loyal and dedicated or talented 
staff. 
To be a Member of this U.S. Senate is 
a true privilege—a working family. It 
is the greatest deliberative body in the 
world. But today as compared to when 
I first came to the Senate, it is the de-
liberative part that gives me great con-
cern. I regret the loss of comity—the 
ability to work together or just to get 
along. Sadly, gridlock appears to be 
the new normal. However, it doesn’t 
have to be this way. 
I am very proud, I have had the privi-
lege of being chairman of a committee 
that does get along, and we do get 
things done—the Senate Agriculture 
Committee. And it is really not that 
hard. First, we represent the best of 
our Nation—farmers, ranchers, grow-
ers, and the entire food value chain. We 
know that we have a collective job to 
do on their behalf—and we do just that. 
Second, we convene in a small hearing 
room—in 
pre-COVID 
times—right 
across the table from each other. 
Third, for the most part, we actually 
know one another. 
I used to be the ranking Republican 
when Senator STABENOW was the chair-
person. We worked together on the 2014 
farm bill. In 2018, this wasn’t our first 
rodeo. We knew, regardless of what 
each of us wanted, passing a farm bill 
was paramount. We had an agree-
ment—no surprises, no press the other 
one did not know about. And we held 
hearings together, all over the country. 
I went to the campus of Michigan State 
and wore green and white; DEBORAH 
came to Kansas State and wore purple. 
We not only agreed to work together, 
we gave staff marching orders to do the 
same. We also became friends. I pro-
tected her and she protected me in con-
ference. And we got 87 votes, setting a 
record for a farm bill—standing right 
there now where our leader is now sit-
ting. I was trying for 90. He said: What 
do you want? I said: I want justice. He 
said: No, you want blood. 
Now, ordinarily, we do not vote 
alike—Senator STABENOW and myself— 
but we remain friends. And that is the 
way it should be. Friendship and com-
ity is the norm for the Ag Committee. 
It could be for the whole Senate. 
Though, things in this great country 
are rocky, I have a news flash: These 
really are not the worst of times. 
When I first came to Washington in 
early 1967, our Nation experienced the 
tragedy of the assassination of Dr. 
Martin Luther King. Within hours, 
Washington was on fire, marines on the 
Capitol steps with sandbags, automatic 
weapons with live ammunition. Ad-
vised to leave the beltway, I mistak-
enly thought I could get to my parents’ 
apartment house. This was BF, before 
Franki. I wanted to take the Rock 
Creek Parkway. No traffic was moving, 
tear gas in the air, random gunshots. I 
decided to jump the curb and drive on 
the sidewalks and eventually on the 
Mall itself. I was in a little Volks-
wagen. The police told me the parkway 
was closed. When they focused on the 
next drivers, I jumped the curb, and I 
took off on the parkway. 
As bad as that period of time was, it 
was not as bad as the military march 
on thousands of World War I veterans 
demonstrating on the Mall and setting 
up camp in the mid-1930s and demand-
ing bonuses. President Hoover ordered 
them removed by the military—led by 
none other than Douglas MacArthur, 
complete with a tank, horse cavalry— 
with swords—and armed troops. The 
‘‘bonus’’ vets were quickly dispersed 
and rounded up. 
Fast forward, the 1968 Chicago riots, 
Kent State and the horrible shooting of 
students by untrained guardsmen. 
Senator Bobby Kennedy, running for 
President, only suffered the same fate 
as his brother. 
And then came Watergate. Those 
days were tough. It was almost impos-
sible not to face the bitter splits over 
our political parties and even families. 
Today, we are in the midst of a 
worldwide pandemic, and even that has 
fallen into politics. But it doesn’t have 
to be. At home, Kansas has been dealt 
its fair share of hardships, but in Kan-
sas—as JERRY MORAN knows—we don’t 
let disasters define us. We grab our 
bootstraps and get to work. That is our 
normal. JERRY will remember multiple 
prairie fires that have ravaged Kansas 
farms and ranches: the Anderson Creek 
fire in 2016, the Starbuck fire in 2017. 
Folks, these flames were 60 feet high 
and moving 60 miles an hour. Those 
folks have learned to adapt and build 
back with the help of USDA disaster 
programs. 
Then we had the tale of Treece, KS— 
once a boom town, turned toxic waste 
dump. It was an extremely unsafe and 
unhealthy place for folks to live. We 
worked with the Obama administration 
and its EPA. I mean, really. No less, we 
relocated them to safer places, lit-
erally, and greener pastures because 
working across party lines is what we 
do in Kansas. 
Let’s not forget about the EF tor-
nado in 2007 that completely destroyed, 
wiped out the community of Greens-
burg, KS. I immediately called Presi-
dent Bush. He was up at Camp David. I 
called from a McDonald’s in the next 
town and asked for help. When I hung 
up, there were 25 people gathered 
around me listening. 
One old-timer, in his bib overalls, 
said to me: PAT, was that the President 
of the United States? 
I said: You bet. 
He turned to his wife and said: Moth-
er, I told you. I told you PAT was a 
talking to the President, and we would 
get help. 
And FEMA was there the next day. 
In a FEMA-issued tent, I talked to 
the graduating senior class, whose 
school and homes were but a pile of de-
bris, and told them: You are the class 
of hope and destiny. The following 
year, President George W. Bush spoke 
at graduation in Greensburg. The size 
of that audience matched the size of 
hope that Kansans had for their future 
and the rebuilding of their lives. 
I am reminded of the optimism of 
those speeches and the optimism that I 
have for our country. We endured these 
hardships. We came out on the other 
side. We did it by changing the old nor-
mal and creating a new normal. 
Here in the Senate, only we can de-
cide what our new normal is, and we 
ought to get to know one another. We 
don’t know one another. We don’t have 
to let the apparent gravitational pull 
of more and more politics and pursuit 
of power to change what our Founders 
gave us—the creation of a nation, of 
liberty and freedom, the envy of the 
world, and to literally move the U.S. 
Senate from the moorings of its his-
toric and great past to simply be a 
rubberstamp for radical change. 
The beauty is that we can decide 
what our normal is. We don’t have to 
let circumstances dictate our future. 
Let us, once again, become a body of 
respect, 
humility, 
cooperation, 
achievement, and, yes, friendship. That 
can and should be our new normal. The 
entire country could use a little bit of 
what we say in Kansas: ad astra per 
aspera; to the stars through difficulty. 
So as my time in the Senate draws to 
a close, I have done my best to improve 
the lives of Kansans and all Americans, 
for decades, to accomplish big and 
small things so that this generation 
and future generations might live and 
achieve the American dream. 
To Kansas, I say a humble thank you. 
Thank you for the privilege of rep-
resenting you in this great body. 
To my colleagues, thank you for 
fighting on behalf of our great Nation 
and alongside me to preserve this 
Chamber. It has been such a privilege. 
As I ride off into the sunset to create a 
new normal for Franki and me, I will 
be cheering for the Senate to rebuild 
the bridges of comity that will create a 
new normal. 
My colleagues, my time is up. Thank 
you for yours. 
I yield the floor. 
(Applause.) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Kansas. 
TRIBUTE TO PAT ROBERTS 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, thank 
you. 
Senator ROBERTS, thank you for your 
comments. 
I am nervous today, and more nerv-
ous now that I have heard you speak, 
because I am concerned that this may 
be for the first time in our lives that I 
have ever spoken longer than you. 
That makes me nervous. 
‘‘I do solemnly swear that I will sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic; that I will bear true 
faith and allegiance to the same.’’ 
These are words spoken by PAT ROB-
ERTS

tember 15, 1958, age 22, PAT ROBERTS

December 10, 2020 
joined the Marine Corps, and he has 
lived by his oath, by his promise to do 
exactly that every day thereafter and 
in every job he pursued here in the 
Congress of the United States, in the 
House and the Senate. 
He indicated he served as the chief of 
staff for Senator Frank Carlson, one of 
those Kansans who served the U.S. Sen-
ate and is so highly regarded even 
today. He served as the chief of staff 
for Congressman Keith Sebelius. 
I met PAT ROBERTS 50 years ago, in 
1969. A few years later, in 1974, I be-
came an intern in the office of Con-
gressman Sebelius. PAT has been my 
boss for 45 years. 
When I describe PAT, I tell people our 
most common conversation is never 
spoken. It is symbols. PAT does this: 
Come here; sit down. Every time I tell 
PAT this, he, in his Jack Benny voice, 
will say: ‘‘Now cut that out.’’ But for 45 
years: Come here; sit down. 
And PAT, while you discount that and 
I highlight it, it has been some of the 
most enjoyable time in my life, where 
I have had the opportunity to be your 
friend and to listen to what you had to 
say. I suppose if I thought long and 
hard, I might find something that 
wasn’t good advice, but I can’t remem-
ber it. So everything in those cir-
cumstances was something that I con-
tinue to value today. I learned some-
thing in every conversation. 
Knowing PAT for 50 years, I told him 
that he just keeps me around and he 
puts up with me because I have at least 
heard of the people he knows. 
He does know people. PAT and I both 
grew up in times of politics in which 
your relationship with voters, your re-
lationship with constituents, your rela-
tionship with Kansans was paramount. 
PAT knew the school superintendent in 
every community. PAT knew the execu-
tive of the chamber of commerce and 
the newspaper editor. He knew the 
president of the county Farm Bureau. 
I don’t know how many times I heard 
PAT say: I am going home to talk to 
the coffee klatch in Dodge City or I am 
going to sit on the wagon tongue and I 
am going to hear from Kansans what 
they have to tell us. 
Politics, as you heard from Senator 
ROBERTS, is in his blood and in his fam-
ily—Wes Roberts, the chairman of the 
Republican 
National 
Committee; 
Frankie Roberts, the staff person for 
Strom Thurmond. It is in his blood and 
in his family. It is not just politics, but 
public service. 
In 1980, PAT ROBERTS decided to be an 
office holder, not an office staffer. The 
first letter I ever wrote to an editor of 
a Kansas paper was to my hometown, 
where his primary opponent lived. I 
supported PAT ROBERTS in a letter to 
the editor when his opponent was 
somebody who was highly regarded and 
a friend of mine. But PAT ROBERTS’ 
friendship and his commitment—who 
he is as a human being and his sworn 
oath—told me that PAT ROBERTS was 
the person I wanted to be my Congress-
man. The constituent in me said: This 
is the guy I want serving me and my 
fellow Kansans. 
He won that election in January of 
1981 and became a House Member rep-
resenting the First Congressional Dis-
trict of Kansas, known in our State as 
‘‘The Big First.’’ The geography of that 
district today—and almost true when 
PAT was the Congressman—is the size 
of the State of Illinois. The largest city 
is Salina, which then had a population 
of about 35,000. It is a rural place, and 
it fit the PAT ROBERTS’ mode of rep-
resentation, which was, I know them 
and they know me. 
He was elected with a significant ma-
jority of voters. He won seven times to 
be reelected to the House of Represent-
atives. He never received less than 60 
percent of the vote, and in his last elec-
tion to the House of Representatives, 
he received nearly 78 percent of Kan-
sans’ approval. Sitting on those wagon 
tongues and listening in on those coffee 
klatches had its consequence. 
It is the kind of politics that PAT de-
scribed that I hope we return to, in 
which it is all about taking care of 
Kansans, taking care of Americans, 
setting aside our differences and find-
ing common ground, just as Kansans— 
particularly, rural Kansans—have to do 
in their community. 
On January 3, 1997, PAT was sworn in 
as a Member of this body. I asked 
Robin, my wife, what it is I might say 
today. She said she remembers in 
about early 1996—maybe late 1995—she 
answered the phone, and it was PAT 
ROBERTS. What he said was, Tell JERRY 
to put his running shoes on. 
PAT ROBERTS gave me the advantage 
of knowing his plans well in advance of 
the public or potential opponents, and 
set the stage in my life as somebody 
whom you would look at and think 
there is no chance of ever being a U.S. 
Senator, but PAT ROBERTS found value 
in me and gave me the opportunity to 
serve where I serve today. I never 
thought I would catch up with Pat in 
the House of Representatives. I never 
thought I would catch up with PAT 
ROBERTS in the U.S. Senate, but be-
cause he and his friends took an inter-
est in me and because this is America, 
that became possible. 
PAT is only the 34th Kansan to serve 
a term in the U.S. Senate. I like that 
number. PAT will recognize that 34 is 
special to Kansans. We are the 34th 
State admitted to the Union, and he is 
the 34th Senator to serve a term from 
Kansas in this body. 
PAT ROBERTS told me to put my run-
ning shoes on, gave me a chance, and 
we have had those running shoes on for 
a long time thereafter. 
PAT is that fourth generation Kansan 
who knows us. I would say one of his 
greatest contributions to our State, to 
the Midwest, and to the country has 
been his distinguished career in leader-
ship in agriculture. The farm bills that 
he mentioned, the work with Demo-
crats 
and 
Republicans 
coming 
to-
gether, fighting for competitive and 
fair markets for our producers, the sup-
port for crop insurance—there is no 
question that Kansas and American 
farmers, ranchers, and producers had a 
strong voice in Congress as a result of 
PAT ROBERTS being here. 
He is distinguished by being the first 
Member of Congress to chair both the 
House and Senate Agriculture Commit-
tees. In the next Congress, we will 
begin the process of writing another 
farm bill, and it will be the first farm 
bill since the Agriculture and Food Act 
of 1981 that will be written without 
PAT ROBERTS’ direct influence. 
However, Senator ROBERTS’ legacy 
and impact on farm policy will be felt 
for generations to come as a result of 
his work in the 1996 Freedom to Farm 
Act, the 2000 Agriculture Risk Protec-
tion Act that modernized crop insur-
ance, and many, many other pieces of 
consequential legislation. 
In his early years in the Senate, as 
Senator ROBERTS indicated, he led the 
Intelligence Committee. This was dur-
ing the 9/11 attacks. Under his leader-
ship, 
the 
committee 
conducted 
a 
sweeping and exhausting review of U.S. 
intelligence, which led to critical re-
forms to put us in a better position to 
know more and protect Americans bet-
ter. That work in intelligence reform 
earned him a spot in a very distin-
guished guest speaker program, the 
prestigious Landon Lecture Series of 
Kansas State University. 
Combining his experience in agri-
culture, intelligence, and in defense, 
Senator ROBERTS has laid the ground-
work for the National Bio and Agro-de-
fense Facility at his alma mater in 
Manhattan, KS. It brings great oppor-
tunity to our State, and we are so 
pleased to have PAT’s accomplishments 
benefit the country and our State for 
generations to come. 
PAT ROBERTS deserves great credit 
for the Eisenhower Memorial. I have 
been around this issue for a long time. 
It has been challenging from the get- 
go. Nothing was easy, and controversy 
apparently follows every new memorial 
on the National Mall. I have no doubt 
that in the absence of PAT’s leadership, 
his bringing people together and per-
haps, yes, his sense of humor, Kansans’ 
President Eisenhower would never be 
seen honored and respected at the me-
morial we now have. 
He, Senator ROBERTS, advocates for 
policies he believes in. He compromises 
when necessary, and he always has a 
way of bringing everyone together, 
often with a joke ready to ease the ten-
sions when things get stressful. 
I always used to tell him: I saw that, 
once again, you became the funniest 
Member of Congress. You got an award. 
He always would correct me: No, I 
am not the funniest Member; I am the 
most humorous Member. 
Many times he has been designated 
the most humorous Member of Con-
gress. 
Some of the most important work he 
has done for Kansans won’t be memori-
alized in laws passed or signed into law 
here in Washington, DC, but in the

meaningful change he made back home 
among the people whom he and I care 
for and love. How about the rural hos-
pitals he fought for to keep their doors 
open or the family farms that are still 
operating because of decisions and ef-
forts he made? He has consistently, 
continuously fought to get farmers and 
ranchers, to get rural communities, to 
get the people of Kansas the right re-
sources at the right time. 
I have had the challenge of following 
in politics in my life, in both the House 
and the Senate, those humorous peo-
ple—PAT
ROBERTS
being 
one. 
The 
greatest challenge, probably for both of 
us, is Bob Dole. How can you ever fol-
low Bob Dole in any way and how can 
you compete with his sense of humor 
and, particularly, his wit? So I asked 
Senator Dole what it is I might say on 
this floor to honor PAT ROBERTS. As 
usual, he took my responsibilities 
away from me and said: Here, just read 
this. 
So these are the words of Bob Dole: 
One of my first memories of Pat was when 
he worked for the late great Sen. Pat Carl-
son. Of course that was well over 50 years 
ago, when Pat was just a young child and I 
was . . . well . . . maybe just a teenager. Pat 
has the best sense of humor of anyone in 
Congress—I’m not sure how he acquired it, 
but I know it serves him well today. Pat—I 
honestly don’t know what it is like to be re-
tired, but people tell me it’s great. Be fore-
warned, though, the rest of the world doesn’t 
operate exactly like the Senate . . . 
If anything goes wrong or breaks at home, 
your trusted Chief of Staff isn’t on speed dial 
to put out the fires. Plus, there’s nobody to 
dial your calls for you anyway. 
Put your alarm clock up for sale on eBay— 
(1) somebody out there might want to buy a 
beat-up clock once owned by a famous Sen-
ator and (2) you won’t need to wake up early 
ever again in your life . . . unless you just 
want to go sit in the D.C. traffic for old 
time’s sake. 
You’ll have to brew your own coffee . . . so 
buy one of those space-age looking contrap-
tions or make friends with your local 
barista. 
You’ll have to share elevators with the 
rest of the world now, so just stop looking 
for that ‘‘Senators Only’’ sign. 
Your grandkids are now your information 
technology department, so reward them ac-
cordingly if you want your computer to be 
up and running. Or just ask Alexa. 
But in all seriousness, Pat, you’ve earned 
some time off for a job well done in Congress 
over these past 40 years. Kansas has cer-
tainly benefited from your steadfast leader-
ship. You care about the Sunflower State, 
and you care about our nation—and that’s 
always been what matters most. Your 
strength of character, plain-spoken opti-
mism, and determination to make a positive 
difference in people’s lives—that’s what peo-
ple will remember about your legacy of pub-
lic service here. You’re a great American and 
a dear friend, and Elizabeth and I wish you 
nothing but the best for you and Franki from 
here on out. One important point of clari-
fication, 
though—the 
filibuster 
simply 
doesn’t work at home. 
God Bless America, 
BOB DOLE. 
I know that all of us and Kansans 
have great regard for Senator Dole. I 
also know that Kansans and all of us 
have great regard for PAT ROBERTS. My 
guess, in knowing PAT, is that his role 
model—the person he may admire the 
most—is that Kansan Dwight Eisen-
hower. In the book ‘‘How Ike Led,’’ 
which PAT gave us all a copy of, I read 
that Ike led with a sense of humor as 
part of the art of leadership of getting 
along with people and getting things 
done. He also said the supreme quality 
for leadership was, unquestionably, in-
tegrity. Without it, no real success was 
possible no matter whether it was on a 
section gang, a football field, in the 
Army, or in an office. 
PAT ROBERTS, I have no doubt that 
you have lived up to that role model— 
that Kansan who is esteemed around 
the world—and you have led like Ike 
led. I thank you and your staff for all 
that you have done for Kansas and for 
America. I thank you for what you 
have done for me and our team. Your 
mom and your dad—your dad, you say, 
got you started in this politics world. I 
knew your mom; I never met your dad. 
They would be so proud of you for the 
service that you are completing this 
term. 
To Franki, David, Ashleigh, and 
Anne-Wesley, thank you for your sup-
port and engagement. It is not PAT 
ROBERTS—it is the family—and you 
have all been engaged in his politics 
and his public service day in and day 
out. 
Robba and I wish you and Franki ab-
solutely the best. 
I told a Kansas farmer what I was 
doing but didn’t ask him for any advice 
as to what to say. His last comment— 
he is a rancher from Elkhart—was, ‘‘As 
a Kansan, I would want to know that 
my Senator fought for my values in DC 
and that the Senator did everything he 
could to ensure our part of the world 
was a priority to the Nation.’’ 
To the rancher in Elkhart, PAT ROB-
ERTS is exactly that—a Kansan who 
fought for our values at home while in 
Washington and did everything he 
could do to ensure that our part of the 
world was not forgotten in this part of 
the world. 
So, PAT, I guess you said thank you 
to Kansans, and you said thank you to 
this Senate. I think it is time for me to 
say in return, on behalf of all Kansans, 
thank you for your service to our Na-
tion and to our State. For a life being 
well lived, you are the example. Thank 
you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise to pay tribute to someone who has 
been more than a colleague, who has 
been more than just a friend. In fact, 
he has been a true partner in this Sen-
ate, and that has paid huge dividends 
for farmers and families and commu-
nities across our country. 
Senator PAT ROBERTS has been here 
in the Senate for a long time. Some 
might even call him an institution. In 
fact, at a recent Ag Committee event, 
I joked that, as a young man, he ad-
vised George Washington on farm pol-
icy. That might be a bit of an exag-
geration, but his legacy can hardly be 
overstated. He has left a lasting im-
print on farm and food policy in this 
country. As has been said, he is the 
only person to have written a farm bill 
as both the chairs of the House and 
Senate Agriculture Committees. 
Those of us who have had the honor 
of working alongside PAT on the Sen-
ate Agriculture Committee know there 
is no other place like it. It is a place 
where we leave politics at the door and 
focus on ways we can improve people’s 
lives and livelihoods in rural America. 
We do that because we know agri-
culture isn’t a red issue or a blue issue. 
Agriculture and food policy affect all 
of us—everyone—and nobody knows 
that better than Senator ROBERTS. 
Senator ROBERTS and I have never 
given up on farm bills, and we never 
gave up on passing the 2018 farm bill 
even when it got tough. At the begin-
ning of the negotiations, we made a 
commitment to work together. We vis-
ited each other’s home States. In fact, 
twice we visited. I arrived in the Little 
Apple of Manhattan, KS, wearing K- 
State purple, which, again on his be-
half, I am wearing today. Then, a few 
weeks 
later, 
PAT
came 
to 
Frankenmuth, MI, and wore an MSU 
green tie. 
Around this time, we also made a 
commitment to each other to write a 
bipartisan farm bill. Throughout the 
entire process, I never doubted that 
PAT had my back, even when negotia-
tions got tough, and he knew I had his 
back as well. Thanks to this partner-
ship, we achieved the most bipartisan 
bill in history. As he said, the first 
time around, it was 86 votes, and then 
the final bill was 87 votes. That was the 
most ‘‘yes’’ votes on a farm bill ever. 
We were able to do that because we had 
a unique partnership built on trust and 
mutual respect, and the outcome was a 
strong, bipartisan bill that provided 
certainty 
for 
farmers—from 
wheat 
farmers in Kansas to cherry growers in 
Michigan. Part of that certainty was 
with special crop insurance, and no-
body deserves more credit for the foun-
dation of that important safety net 
than Senator PAT ROBERTS. 
PAT is also a champion for food secu-
rity and agriculture exports and agri-
culture research, which is why he and I 
worked together to establish the Foun-
dation for Food and Agriculture Re-
search in the 2014 farm bill. He also un-
derstands the importance of protecting 
food assistance for children and for 
families. I was honored to share the 
Food Research and Action Center Dis-
tinguished Service Award with Senator 
ROBERTS last year for our teamwork. 
Above all, it has been an honor work-
ing with PAT because he is truly one of 
a kind. From the moment I met him, it 
became abundantly clear that he was 
not 
the 
run-of-the-mill 
politician. 
Some say it is his unflappable nature. 
Others say it is his unique sense of 
humor. Yet, to me, PAT ROBERTS is de-
fined by his loyalty, his integrity, and 
his dedication to the people of Kansas.

S7387 
December 10, 2020 
He started his career as a first lieu-
tenant in the Marine Corps. It is clear 
he has carried that courage and convic-
tion with him throughout his entire 
life. As he said, he was also a news-
paper reporter, which makes sense 
when you think about his dogged deter-
mination and, for better or worse, his 
ability to be exceptionally quotable. As 
a public servant, he is so beloved in his 
home State of Kansas that he has 
never lost an election—a record 24 and 
0. If only his K-State Wildcats could be 
so lucky. 
(Laughter.) 
Senator PAT ROBERTS, it has been an 
honor to be your partner and an even 
bigger honor to be your friend. So, 
while your retirement is well-deserved, 
you will be deeply missed on the Agri-
culture Committee and in the Senate. 
Thank you for all you have done for 
farmers and families and for the Amer-
ican people. I wish you only continued 
happiness and success as you and 
Franki and the family move to this 
next piece of your life. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, my 
seatmate here, PAT ROBERTS, is going 
to be missed not just by the whole Sen-
ate, not by the Nation, not by the peo-
ple of Kansas, but by a lot of us he 
keeps going day-to-day and has for a 
long time. 
I first met PAT ROBERTS in 1979. I had 
just been elected in 1978 to the U.S. 
House of Representatives. As has been 
said here today, he was the chief of 
staff 
of 
distinguished 
Congressman 
Keith Sebelius, who was well recog-
nized and well respected on both sides 
of the aisle. PAT was his chief of staff. 
Our paths crossed later when he was 
elected to the Senate. We served on the 
Intelligence Committee together and 
on other committees. 
He is unique. That wit of his, I 
think—the humor—is genetic. He has a 
daughter who is like that, which is 
wonderful, I think. I told PAT one time: 
That 
must 
be 
an 
inherited 
char-
acteristic. He smiled. He understood. 
Yet PAT ROBERTS is a lot more than 
just a little humor to me; he is a seri-
ous person. He has had, as you know, a 
distinguished career as a Kansas State 
graduate, a Marine officer, a staffer, a 
Congressman, and one who has chaired 
both Ag Committees in the House and 
Senate, which has never been done—40 
years of elected office between the 
House and the Senate. 
We are going to miss you, PAT. I am 
going to miss you. I have sat here with 
you, and I have sat all over the Senate 
with you. 
I will tell you, if you are feeling down 
about something or if you are feeling 
bleak 
that 
day, 
PAT
will 
either 
straighten you out or make you think 
that this is not all bad, that America is 
coming together, and that it is always 
coming together. 
So, PAT, you have your great family 
up here with you today. Franki has 
been unique for you. She has been a 
great influence on you. We are going to 
miss you. I am going to miss that 
humor every day. Godspeed. 
Mr. President, today, I would like to 
speak about my longtime colleague 
and friend, Senator PAT ROBERTS. 
PAT and I have served together in 
Congress for 40 years. It comes as no 
surprise that he is the longest-serving 
member of the Kansas delegation. 
Born in Topeka, PAT graduated from 
Kansas State University (K-State) and 
served as an officer in the U.S. Marine 
Corps, achieving the rank of First 
Lieutenant. 
He went on to work for Senator 
Frank Carlson and later Congressman 
Keith Sebelius, whom he succeeded in 
the House of Representatives in 1980. 
PAT
and I were colleagues in the 
House. It was there that we first be-
came friends. 
In 1996, PAT was elected to represent 
Kansas in the U.S. Senate and is cur-
rently finishing his fourth term. 
PAT ROBERTS has had quite the ca-
reer in public service. Over his four 
decades in Congress, he has served as 
chairman of the House Agriculture 
Committee, the Senate Ethics Com-
mittee, the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee, and the Senate Agriculture 
Committee. 
PAT ROBERTS is the first Member of 
Congress in history to have chaired 
both the House Agriculture Committee 
and the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
He has also served as the ranking 
member on each of those committees. 
In 2018, Senator ROBERTS became the 
first Member of Congress to write and 
pass farm bill in both Chambers. 
Over the years, his dedication to the 
people of Kansas has been extraor-
dinary and inspiring. 
He arrived on Capitol Hill as a staffer 
in 1967—and is leaving Washington as 
the longest serving Member of Con-
gress in his State’s history. 
It is also worth noting that he never 
lost a race. Not once. 
PAT
ROBERTS
will undoubtedly be 
missed in the Senate by his peers on 
both sides of the aisle. 
Senator ROBERTS
is currently my 
deskmate on the Senate floor. I know I 
will miss his congeniality and humor 
during our conversations. 
Annette and I have enjoyed spending 
time with PAT and Franki over the 
years. We wish them all the best. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I first 
met PAT ROBERTS when I was running 
for the U.S. House of Representatives 
for the very first time. I had a friend 
who worked for PAT, and he got me a 
meeting with him, which, at the time, 
was a pretty big deal because he was 
the chairman of the House Ag Com-
mittee, and I was in a Republican pri-
mary, where I was over 50 points be-
hind. So the prospects weren’t really 
bright that I was ever going to be 
somebody who would make it through 
and end up serving there, but nobody 
could have been more encouraging or 
kind. I had a great meeting with him. 
We talked about agriculture. I am 
grateful that I have had the oppor-
tunity to get to know him pretty well 
here during my time in the Senate. 
One of the reasons we have so much 
common ground is we both come from 
States where agriculture is incredibly 
important. It is the No. 1 industry in 
South Dakota. I have had the privilege 
of serving on the Ag Committee with 
PAT now for more than a decade. I call 
him ‘‘my chairman’’ since he has been 
my chairman on the Ag Committee for 
so long. He calls me ‘‘Coop’’—a mon-
iker he gave me very early in our ac-
quaintance because he says I look like 
Gary Cooper. Now, I have to admit that 
the first time he called me that I had 
to look up some pictures to see if that 
were a compliment or not, but I know 
that he meant it that way. Whenever 
he introduced me at the Ag Committee, 
it was always, ‘‘Coop, it’s high noon. 
You’re up.’’ ‘‘High Noon’’ was a famous 
movie in which Gary Cooper starred 
with Grace Kelly. 
Of course, PAT is, I would say, some-
body who is very accomplished in talk-
ing about movies from that era and 
stars from that era. He knows a little 
bit about everything and a lot about a 
few things. I call him ‘‘my chairman,’’ 
as I said, because he has been there for 
an awfully long time, and he never 
minds the stories and nicknames. They 
are quintessentially PAT. It is just the 
way that he conducts himself. 
Somebody talked about his sense of 
humor here this morning. I think Sen-
ator MORAN talked about PAT’s being a 
funny guy in the Senate and of PAT’s 
saying he was not a funny guy but a 
humorous guy. I would say he is a 
funny person. He is a comedian by na-
ture, and he keeps all of us entertained 
with his repertoire of country music 
lyrics, his old movie quotes, and just a 
storytelling flair. You can be sure that, 
if you are going to be around PAT for 
very long, you are going to have a few 
belly laughs. 
I always tell him—and I think it is 
true, and I think you have kind of 
heard it today—when he gets up on the 
floor and speaks or when he speaks at 
a committee hearing, that when you 
close your eyes, you kind of hear Paul 
Harvey. Senator MORAN said he sound-
ed like Jack Benny once in a while, and 
maybe that is true, too. What I always 
knew when I was growing up was that 
Paul Harvey was a voice that was on 
the radio pretty much every day in our 
house, and I hear that same sort of 
Midwestern, 
resonant, 
and 
commonsensical voice whenever I hear 
PAT get up and talk. 
But I will tell you that PAT may have 
a great sense of humor—he does keep 
us constantly smiling around here, 
which is something we don’t do near 
often enough, particularly these days— 
but he is also very, very serious when 
it comes to getting things done for the 
people of Kansas, and they couldn’t 
have a better advocate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7388 
December 10, 2020 
As I said, both PAT and I come from 
States whose lifeblood is agriculture, 
and PAT ROBERTS’ heart has always 
beat with the farmers of this country. 
His advocacy for American agriculture 
resulted in his serving as chairman of 
both the House and the Senate Agri-
culture Committees during his career, 
and, as already been noted, he is the 
first Member of Congress in history— 
first in history—to have served as the 
chairman of both the House Agri-
culture and the Senate Agriculture 
Committee. 
He is also the first Member of Con-
gress to have written and passed a farm 
bill in both Chambers. I think he has 
worked, as was said earlier, on eight 
farm bills in all, which is an incredible 
number. And I am proud to have 
worked with him on three farm bills in 
the Senate, including the 2018 farm 
bill, which passed the Senate with the 
greatest number of votes of any farm 
bill in Senate history—a tribute to the 
hard work that PAT and his staff put 
into building consensus and reaching 
out to Members from all across this 
country who represent different areas, 
different commodities, different crops, 
and bringing them together to write a 
farm bill. 
I have been around here long enough 
and been associated with enough farm 
bills to know that they tend to be kind 
of controversial because some people 
represent cities and maybe don’t have 
agricultural constituencies. So the fact 
that PAT was successful in getting a 
farm bill across the finish line here in 
the Senate with a record 87 votes is a 
remarkable accomplishment in and of 
itself. 
Of course, PAT’s leadership, as has al-
ready been pointed out, hasn’t been 
limited to agriculture. Among other 
things, he has served as chairman of 
the Senate Intelligence Committee, 
where he led a sweeping review of the 
U.S. intelligence apparatus and ad-
vanced a number of reforms to shore up 
our intelligence and our national secu-
rity. Then there is his work on bio-
sciences, military issues, education, 
healthcare, and the list goes on and on 
and on. 
PAT has proudly represented the peo-
ple of Kansas in Congress for 40 years— 
16 in the House of Representatives and 
now 24 in the U.S. Senate—but, as has 
already been mentioned as well, his 
public service began long before that 
with his time as an officer in the U.S. 
Marine Corps. Once a marine, always a 
marine. PAT has proudly represented 
the marines here in Congress. He is 
currently the most senior marine serv-
ing here on Capitol Hill. 
The motto of the Marine Corps is 
‘‘Semper 
Fidelis’’—always 
faithful. 
PAT has lived out that motto over his 
long career of service to our country, 
and I hate to think of a Senate without 
PAT ROBERTS. He will be sorely missed, 
but he has more than earned his retire-
ment and a chance to spend more time 
with his wife Franki and his children 
and grandchildren. I know how much 
they have contributed to his success 
here. There aren’t any of us who are 
here who don’t have a supportive fam-
ily, supportive spouse. We are truly 
grateful for the many contributions 
that Franki and the family have made 
to PAT’s accomplishments here, his 
success in the Senate, and I know he is 
looking forward to spending more time 
with them in the future. 
PAT, thank you for your leadership, 
for your friendship. May God bless you 
in your retirement. I will miss you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise 
also to say farewell to a truly great 
Senator, Senator PAT ROBERTS. 
He has been a friend and a mentor of 
mine in the U.S. Senate. He has been a 
leader, and there is no doubt—we are 
hearing it all—about all his accom-
plishments. He is certainly one of the 
great State of Kansas’s most accom-
plished Senators ever. 
But I would be remiss if I didn’t men-
tion that he is also a great Senator for 
another group of proud Americans, and 
that would be the U.S. Marine Corps. 
Senator ROBERTS has taken care of the 
U.S. Marines during his entire tenure 
here. If the marines needed something, 
they knew where to go—the great Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
As you know, most Senators wear 
their Senate pin here, indicating that 
they are a Senator. We are proud to 
wear that. For the years I have known 
Senator ROBERTS—he is probably doing 
it again today—he wears his pin, but 
sometimes and usually he actually 
wears the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor, 
showing—and I think he has one on 
right now—where so much of his loy-
alty lies—with the U.S. Marine Corps. 
So I know that the marines are cer-
tainly going to miss Senator ROBERTS. 
I am certainly going to miss Senator 
ROBERTS. 
You know, just like in his remarks 
today, he is a man of great wit, great 
stories, and I have had the honor to 
hear so many of these stories, and a lot 
of these stories, of course, for me, in-
volve Alaska and the late great Sen-
ator Ted Stevens, who was also a very 
close friend of PAT’s, in the seat which 
I am honored to hold here in the U.S. 
Senate. I have learned so much from 
these stories that I heard from Senator 
ROBERTS. 
Most importantly, he has been a 
great example for me and so many 
other Senators. He is a statesman, a 
marine, an optimist. You heard it in 
his remarks today. We need more of 
that. He is a family man, a dedicated 
husband for over 50 years to a beau-
tiful, wonderful wife; a leader in the 
Senate—six chairmanships—who gets 
things done for his State and for his 
country; and finally, a man of integ-
rity—of integrity. 
You know, it is tough duty to be the 
chairman of the Senate Ethics Com-
mittee, but the Senate Ethics Com-
mittee is much needed here, and to 
chair that committee for 24 years is a 
testament of every single Senator here 
saying how much they believe in this 
man’s integrity. 
I was honored a couple of years ago 
when PAT asked me to serve on the Ei-
senhower Memorial Commission. It was 
a true honor for me, and I will say I 
saw again one of the great qualities of 
Senator ROBERTS’ tenacity. On a rainy 
night a few months ago, I attended the 
dedication ceremony of President Ei-
senhower and watched as America cele-
brated a great American, a great Kan-
san, and there is one person who really 
made that a reality—Senator PAT ROB-
ERTS. 
So today we say farewell to another 
great Kansan and a great American, 
my good friend Senator PAT ROBERTS. 
Thank you, sir, for the example, for 
the mentorship, for the friendship, and 
your great service to the Senate, to 
Kansas, to America, and to the U.S. 
Marine Corps. Semper Fi. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 6395 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I sound a 
little redundant here because we have 
been talking about this bill for a long 
time now, for several months. People 
don’t realize how long it takes to get a 
defense authorization bill all the way 
through the system. There is no doubt 
in my mind that this is the most im-
portant bill of the year, every year, 
and the importance, I think, is pretty 
well demonstrated by the fact that we 
have successfully passed a defense au-
thorization bill every year for 60 years. 
And I feel we will do the same thing. It 
could be today, it could be tomorrow, 
but nonetheless, it is a bill that has to 
pass. 
Now, when President Trump came 
into office 4 years ago, we had a prob-
lem. He inherited a military that had 
serious problems. In fact, during the 
last 4 years of the previous administra-
tion—that would have been 2010 to 
2015—the President depleted the budget 
or reduced the budget for military by 
25 percent. 
I don’t say that really critically of 
President Obama because he had dif-
ferent priorities. He was up-front about 
it and didn’t consider this to be high 
enough of a priority. Now, the sad 
thing about this is that at the same 
time that he was reducing our military 
spending by 25 percent, Russia was in-
creasing theirs threefold and China’s 
was increased by 83 percent. So we 
dropped ours by 25 percent, and at the 
same time, China increased theirs 83 
percent. That is really serious.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7389 
December 10, 2020 
People have this assumption that 
America has the best of everything and 
that we don’t have any problem out 
there, but we do, and we found several 
systems where they were actually get-
ting ahead of us. So, working with Con-
gress, we passed the NDAA appropria-
tions bill. We secured nearly $3 trillion 
in funding for our Nation’s defense. 
This year alone, the administration 
will provide more than $740 billion for 
resources our military needs to keep 
our country and our troops safe. 
The fiscal year 2021 National Defense 
Authorization Act cements President 
Trump’s hard work to restore our mili-
tary to be the best fighting force. That 
is what we are supposed to be doing in 
America. The NDAA authorizes critical 
investments to protect our military ad-
vantage across all domains, from the 
skies to the seas and even now through 
space, a whole new program. 
With the President’s leadership last 
year, the NDAA created the Space 
Force. It is the first time there has 
been a new branch since 1947, and that 
happened this year. This year’s NDAA 
makes sure that it is set up success-
fully. 
One of the things about the Space 
Force that I think people who are 
somewhat critical of—we were doing a 
good job in space before without the 
Space Force, but the fact that we can 
concentrate all those efforts in one 
force and be on equal footing—because 
that is exactly what our primary prob-
lem is out there with China and Russia. 
They both have what would be in their 
interpretation a space force, so it was 
important that we did, too, and that 
was the right thing to do. 
This also authorizes the procurement 
of 93 F–35s, the Joint Strike Fighters, 
to continue the rebuilding of our over-
worked combat aircraft. It also in-
cludes authorizations for C–130J air-
craft, which will modernize our fleet, 
used for transportation of personnel 
and also for refuelers and things that 
we have to do in the military. That is 
an upgrade of the old version. The J 
model of the C–130 is a great vehicle. 
We have to have it authorized and all 
of the priorities set. That is what this 
bill does. 
We also have authorized the procure-
ment of nine new battle force ships, in-
cluding the Virginia-class submarines. 
We talked about that for a long time, 
and now we are finally doing that. 
Another area that we have been 
doing is our nuclear forces. Our Presi-
dent has been a champion for our nu-
clear modernization efforts—and for 
good reason. Our nuclear deterrent is 
the cornerstone of our national secu-
rity. The NDAA ensures that our Na-
tion wields a safe and reliable nuclear 
deterrent by authorizing the resources 
needed to modernize. 
Now, we didn’t do this for a long pe-
riod of time. We fell behind. This bill is 
reversing that, and we are getting back 
into the competition—the nuclear com-
petition. That is where the real threat 
is. Everybody knows that. 
I think having the best weapons and 
equipment is critical, to be sure, but 
we also need the infrastructure and 
manpower to support it. Over the past 
several years, Congress has provided 
the military with significant funding 
increases and authorizations to begin 
and continue critical military con-
struction projects overseas, as well as 
in our country. 
These military construction projects 
can be found everywhere—from Arkan-
sas to South Carolina, Oklahoma to 
California, and Missouri to Massachu-
setts, and all across the country. These 
investments will also build on our im-
provements to family housing. 
I have heard people complain about 
what we do for the military in this 
country, and they try to say that we 
are spending more on our military than 
both China and Russia put together. 
Yeah, that is true, but there is a reason 
for that, and the reason for that is that 
the most expensive thing in building a 
military is individuals—what we are 
spending on individuals, on housing, 
and on all these things. 
Now, when you are dealing with it, 
and looking at Communist countries, 
and you look at Russia and you look at 
China, they don’t take care of their 
people. They don’t have that expense, 
and that is why we spend more than 
they do. You know, just in the last 2 
years, what we have done to improve 
housing for our troops—troops and 
their families—other people don’t do 
that, but we do it. So that is why it is 
so significant that we do this. 
I have a concern that I would like to 
share, and I hesitate to do this because 
it will take a little bit of time. People 
out there don’t realize, in a bill like 
this, what all goes into it. I looked at 
the people who are heading this thing 
up, 
and, 
yesterday, 
Senator 
REED 
talked about the Democrats and the 
Republicans and their staff people, who 
worked so hard. Let me say this: We 
could not have done this without the 
cooperation and the love that we have 
for each other, with Senator REED. I 
mean, he heads up the minority, and I 
head up the majority, and we want, to-
gether, to make sure we have the best 
product in the world and that we get 
the best of everything for our troops in 
the field. 
So I want to really single out Sen-
ator REED for all the work that he has 
done. He has been a great partner and 
friend throughout this process. And we 
want to thank our colleagues in the 
House also—Congressman SMITH
and 
Congressman 
THORNBERRY. 
We 
all 
worked together. 
You know, I have been involved in a 
lot of these things, and they always 
end up in the Big 4. That is where you 
have the leading Democrat and Repub-
lican in the House and Democrat and 
Republican in the Senate, insofar as 
defense is concerned, and we iron these 
things out. But in the meantime, this 
long bill is one that has taken just a 
lot of work. And I know that, yester-
day, Senator REED got a chance to 
mention the names of and show his ap-
preciation for the Democrats that 
worked in the minority, and I want us 
to do the same thing for the Repub-
licans in the majority. 
John Bonsell—I don’t think there is a 
person in Washington, DC, who knows 
more about the military than John 
Bonsell does. And he put together a 
group of people. These are all experts. 
They all work—you know, people don’t 
understand this, but I am talking 
about weekends, Sundays, times that 
they have to work to get these things 
done and to get that bill into position, 
because you have to pass it through 
the Senate, and you have to go onto 
the Senate floor. Then you have to go 
to the House and the House committee 
and the House floor, and then you have 
to have a conference. 
There are some things in this bill 
that we avoided having—and I am 
thankful that we did, quite frankly— 
that the House wanted and the Senate 
didn’t want. We were able to iron out 
these differences and get them done. 
But to do that, we had to work long 
hours. I can assure you that the staff 
worked a lot longer hours than I did. 
So I single these people out as really 
experts, and I want to show them ap-
preciation, and I am just going to read 
them off to you here: John Bonsell. We 
know about John Bonsell. We know 
what he has done. He has been with me 
since he was, years ago, stationed at 
Fort Sill in my State of Oklahoma. He 
has been with me, and he has been 
heading up this group and putting the 
group together. 
This group consists of: John Wason, 
Tom Goffus, Stephanie Barna, Greg 
Lilly, Marta Hernandez, Rick Berger, 
Jennie Wright, Adam Barker, Adam 
Trull, Al Edwards, Sean O’Keefe, Brad 
Patout, Jason Potter, Katie Sutton, 
Eric 
Trager, 
TC 
Williams, 
Otis 
Winkler, Gwyneth Woolwine, Katie 
Magnus, 
Leah 
Brewer, 
Debbie 
Chiarello, 
Gary 
Howard, 
Tyler 
Wilkinson, John Bryant, Griffin Can-
non, Keri-Lyn Michalke, Soleil Sykes, 
Brittany 
Amador, 
and 
Jillian 
Schofield. 
Now, these people, they are just 
names to a lot of other people, but each 
one has just really performed long and 
hard hours. There has been more staff 
work go into this bill than any other 
bill that is before us, than anytime 
year round. 
So I just appreciate so much the hard 
work that has gone there, and we will 
pass this bill. It is one that if we don’t 
pass it, we are not going to give the re-
sources necessary for our kids in the 
field to have the safety that we can 
provide them and to have the equip-
ment. 
We want to get to the point where we 
have the very best of everything out 
there, and right now, we don’t. China 
and Russia are knocking at our door. 
We have to do a better job than we 
have done in the past, and I am going 
to be working with the administration 
to do everything we can for the coming

year. But right now, we need to get 
caught up and go ahead and pass this. 
This bill is the roadmap for the next 
year, and that is why this is important. 
So I encourage all of us to do what we 
have to do to get this bill done—hope-
fully, today, but definitely by tomor-
row. I believe that will happen because 
people do care about our troops. There 
is no one more deserving in America 
than our troops who are out there in 
harm’s way, and we are going to make 
sure that we do the right thing for 
them. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to floor today in complete sup-
port of Senator INHOFE, the chairman 
of the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee, and I come in support of the 
National Defense Authorization Act. I 
come to speak to that, and I am so 
grateful for the Senator from Okla-
homa and for his ongoing, determined 
leadership in making sure that our Na-
tion remains safe and secure and free. 
And it is because of the work done by 
Senator INHOFE and his committee and 
this body and this legislation that we 
will be voting on. I am so grateful for 
the leadership of the chairman, and I 
want to talk, specifically, about the 
reason I think it is important that we 
do pass the legislation that the com-
mittee has worked so hard on. 
So the Presiding Officer knows, as a 
member of that committee, that this 
critical national security legislation 
lays out America’s defense and na-
tional security priorities, as the Sen-
ator from Oklahoma just made up, for 
the years to come. It sets the policies 
to defend our Nation, and it supports 
America’s service men and women here 
at home, as well as those abroad. 
I was honored to spend Thanksgiving, 
again this year, with Wyoming Na-
tional Guard troops, members of our 
Air National Guard, and they are serv-
ing at this time in Qatar, in the Al 
Udeid Air Force Base in the Persian 
Gulf. And when I think of the National 
Defense Authorization Act, this legis-
lation before us today, I think of them. 
I think about the members there— 
Charlie Med, doing medical evacu-
ations and medical transport. 
First, I will tell you that, in terms of 
these Wyoming soldiers who are there, 
if you are in need of medical care or 
medical transport, you would be in 
very capable hands. You also know 
they have what they need to be able to 
do the job. I think of them, and I think 
of their families—the sacrifices that 
are being made by the families at 
home, because the families play a sig-
nificant and important role in this as 
well. 
You know, it is interesting, with so 
many deployed overseas right now, 
some of them have found that their de-
ployments have been extended. Be-
cause of coronavirus, they are unable 
to do the transports of moving people 
back to the United States for the holi-
days and then back into the fields, so 
that they have many who felt that 
they would be home for the holidays 
who are going to find that they are not 
able to be home for the holidays. So I 
think it is very important that the 
Senate send a strong message that we 
have their backs, just as they have 
ours. 
This is an incredibly bipartisan piece 
of legislation—one of the most bipar-
tisan pieces of legislation every year 
when it comes to the floor of the Sen-
ate. It reflects equal input from Repub-
licans and from Democrats. The Senate 
Armed Services Committee adopted 229 
bipartisan amendments before it ap-
proved the NDAA this summer by a 
vote in the committee, on which the 
Presiding Officer also sits, of 25 to 2. 
It is also in line with the Bipartisan 
Budget Act of 2019. It supports $741 bil-
lion in defense funding for the 2021 fis-
cal year. 
The NDAA is really a proud tradition 
of this institution and of our Nation. 
This is the 60th year in a row that the 
Senate has taken up the NDAA, and it 
has passed this body every year. We 
need to make sure this year is no ex-
ception. The world may be distracted 
by other things that are going on—cer-
tainly, the issue of a coronavirus pan-
demic—but, make no mistake, China 
and Russia still have global ambitions, 
and they pose grave threats to our Na-
tion’s security. 
The Chinese military has actually 
stepped up its aggression against its 
neighbors, and we see it in the South 
China Sea. Russia is using energy as a 
weapon against its neighbors, and it 
continues cyber attacks against gov-
ernments and institutions around the 
globe. This legislation will help keep 
China and Russia in check. 
It maintains our high-tech edge, as 
the chairman of the Armed Services 
Committee has just said. It modernizes 
our nuclear weapons system with fund-
ing for the Ground Based Strategic De-
terrent. 
It 
invests 
in 
new 
tech-
nologies—hypersonic weapons, biotech-
nologies, artificial intelligence, cyber 
security—all of which are designed to 
help keep us safe and free. 
It implements the National Defense 
Strategy to promote a strong military 
deterrent and to strive for lasting 
peace, and it delivers a well-deserved 
pay raise for our troops, along with 
high-quality housing, healthcare, and 
childcare 
for 
military 
families 
at 
home, as well as abroad. 
So I do want to thank Senator 
INHOFE and Ranking Member Senator 
REED of Rhode Island for their work in 
bringing this bill to the floor. Demo-
crats have a history of opposing some-
times stronger defense funding, espe-
cially during the Obama-Biden years, 
but this makes longer term funding un-
certain, and it becomes even more im-
portant to do what we need to do now 
to stand up against our adversaries. 
No, we can’t afford to slow our Na-
tion’s 
critical 
defense 
investments 
now. This NDAA will protect American 
leadership and values all around the 
world, and it will give our Nation what 
we need to confront the aggressors that 
I mentioned, like China and Russia. 
This legislation is strategic, and this 
legislation is strong. It is smart, and it 
supports our troops, and it stands up to 
our enemies. The Senate needs to pass 
this, the 60th National Defense Author-
ization Act. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, I would now like 
to take a moment to discuss another 
topic, and that is coronavirus relief for 
American families. 
Increasingly, we are seeing commu-
nities across the country asking for a 
clear path forward—a path forward to 
put the virus behind us and to help us 
grow our economy. The takeaway from 
last Friday’s job report is we really 
have no time to waste. For the first 
time since we passed the CARES Act, 
the jobs report showed signs of a slow-
ing recovery—recovery, yes, but not as 
rapid as planned. 
The sectors hardest hit at the begin-
ning of the pandemic are now hard hit 
again—retail and food services. The Re-
publican-led CARES Act secured the 
swiftest, strongest economic recovery 
in our Nation’s history. It added more 
than 12.3 million jobs in the last 7 
months. It has been a great American 
comeback. 
At the end of this month, provisions 
of the CARES Act are expiring—things 
like sick leave, unemployment bene-
fits, and tax provisions. We need to ex-
tend those. For small businesses, I be-
lieve we need to reestablish and refur-
bish the popular Paycheck Protection 
Program. The money has gone. I talked 
to small businesses in Wyoming, talked 
to county commissioners last night, 
and talked to our Wyoming stock 
growers yesterday. We need to replen-
ish the Paycheck Protection Program. 
We need to reallocate unused funds 
for immediate needs now. Republican 
priorities are American priorities in 
terms of relief from coronavirus. 
We want to make sure, certainly, to 
fund the distribution of the vaccine, 
which is ready to go. We need to pro-
vide relief for individuals and small 
businesses, and we need to get kids 
back into the classroom safely so they 
don’t fall further behind. 
The job we need to do is significant, 
it is serious, and relief is necessary. We 
need to get a bridge to the point where 
people have either received the vaccine 
or there is immunity in communities. 
Republicans are offering a path for-
ward. We are doing it legislatively. 
What we have heard from the Demo-
crats are hard lines, all-or-nothing de-
mands. We have heard them for the 
last 7 months. Democrats have offered 
no new proposals for COVID relief. 
They passed their $3 trillion Fantasy 
Island bill in May and never lifted a 
pen after that. 
In the last 6 months, Democrats have 
blocked relief that we have offered on 
the Senate floor four different times. 
Last week, Speaker PELOSI said—ad-
mitted—that she had held up all those

6 months of coronavirus relief for the 
American public for political gain, for 
politics. And we heard it from the mi-
nority assistant leader just yesterday, 
admitting the same, punishing the 
American people for politics. It is a sad 
commentary on where that party has 
been as the American people are asking 
for relief. Democrats don’t have a plan. 
They played politics with the pan-
demic. 
Again, our path forward is to do the 
things that we know need to be done: 
distribute the vaccine, provide Ameri-
cans with relief, and get Americans’ 
lives back on track. What we hear from 
Democrats are more lockdowns, more 
taxes during a pandemic, and more spe-
cial projects for the far left. It is sad. 
The Democrats’ policies don’t meet the 
moment. We need to get relief to the 
public now. Democrats are ignoring 
where we really are in terms of the 
cost the Americans have borne and the 
progress that we have made in the re-
covery, and they have done it for polit-
ical purposes. 
Scientists and researchers are within 
several days of approval of the vaccine 
and a distribution nationwide. The 
country is soon going to have several 
highly effective vaccines distributed to 
every State. 
In Wyoming, we are looking forward 
to 5,000 vaccines as early as Monday 
and 15,000 by the end of the month. I 
talked to the head of the intensive care 
unit at the Wyoming Medical Center 
just the other day—the hospital where 
I had been chief of staff, where there 
are increasing numbers of patients in 
the intensive care unit on respirators, 
where the staff is exhausted. They say: 
We need the vaccine for the staff, for 
the 
frontline 
workers, 
for 
the 
healthcare workers, for the elderly, 
and for the nursing home patients so 
they don’t end up in the hospital and 
on ventilators. 
These are the healthcare heroes of 
the day, the doctors and nurses taking 
care of these sick patients. We are 
going to administer vaccines to them, 
to the nursing home patients, and to 
those at high risk. Over the next 3 
months, over 1 million people will be 
vaccinated. 
Relief is necessary. In our State, we 
have lost 299 citizens to coronavirus—a 
number that I would have thought 
would not have occurred. This is with 
people trying to social distance, people 
trying to do the kinds of things in 
terms of wearing masks—a behavior 
that we know, with hygiene, would 
minimize the spread—but still the dis-
ease continues to spread. 
The vaccine is the solution, but be-
tween now and the time the people can 
get vaccinated, help is needed, and it is 
up to this body to act. We still have 
work to do on behalf of the American 
people. I hope that the Democrats will 
join us in this effort this holiday sea-
son to get that relief to folks who need 
it. In the meantime, I say let’s con-
tinue to do the things that we know 
work so we can stay safe and our busi-
nesses and our country can stay open. 
With that, I thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
this country faces an unprecedented 
crisis in terms of the pandemic and the 
economic meltdown. I understand that 
negotiations are currently going on in 
terms of coming up with an economic 
package dealing with COVID–19 relief, 
and I applaud the very hard work that 
each of the negotiators are doing, 
Democrats and Republicans. But the 
truth is that the results up to this 
point for those negotiations are totally 
unsatisfactory given the economic des-
peration facing tens of millions of 
working families all across this coun-
try. 
As I think everyone will remember, 
back in March of this year, at the be-
ginning of the pandemic, the U.S. Con-
gress 
acted 
unanimously—unani-
mously, Democrats and Republicans— 
and worked with President Trump to 
come up with an economic package 
that went a long way toward pre-
venting absolute misery and destitu-
tion for many of our people. 
Through no fault of their own, 
COVID–19 resulted in millions of our 
people losing their jobs and their in-
come. That is what the pandemic did. 
Nobody is to blame. That is what hap-
pened. And in response, in March, 
Democrats and Republicans in this 
Congress came together, worked with 
the President of the United States, and 
in a very significant way responded to 
that crisis. That is what we did in 
March. 
What I don’t understand is that at a 
time when, in many ways, the eco-
nomic and public health crisis is worse 
today than it was in March, why we are 
not responding accordingly? 
In March, as you know, we passed the 
$2.2 trillion CARES Act, which in-
cluded a $600 supplement to unem-
ployed workers, and, my God, what re-
lief that was to millions of workers 
who had lost their jobs. In addition, we 
provided a $1,200 direct payment to 
every working-class adult in this coun-
try, plus $500 for their kids. 
Once again—and let me repeat this— 
we did this unanimously, and we did it 
working with President Trump despite 
many of the enormous disagreements 
that a lot of us have with President 
Trump on so many issues. 
Now, what I don’t understand is, if 
we could work together in March, if we 
could have succeeded 9 months ago, 
why can we not do exactly the same 
thing right now? That is why I will in-
sist that any agreement in terms of a 
COVID–19 relief package must include 
not only strong unemployment benefits 
but a $1,200 direct payment for the 
working families of this country, simi-
larly structured to what was included 
in the CARES package of March. 
I will be introducing an amendment 
to the 1-week continuing resolution to 
make sure that occurs, that every 
working-class adult in this country re-
ceives another $1,200 direct payment, 
plus $500 for their kids. If we could do 
it in March and it was the right thing 
then, now, at a time when the situation 
in many ways is even worse, we can 
and must do it today. 
Every Member of this body, I know, 
wants to get out of Washington to get 
home to their families for the holiday 
season, and put me at the very top of 
that list. But at a time when so many 
American families are suffering, when 
so many people don’t know how they 
are going to feed their kids or prevent 
being evicted from their homes or how 
they are going to pay for a doctor’s 
visit, we cannot leave Washington and 
return to our families unless we ad-
dress the economic suffering that so 
many other families are facing. 
When a national emergency occurs, 
the U.S. Government must respond. 
And we are in a national emergency 
today. To get out of Washington, to 
turn our backs on the suffering of so 
many men, women, and children in 
Vermont and in every other State in 
this country, would be immoral, it 
would be unconscionable, and we can-
not allow that to happen. 
Again, we must make certain that 
every working family in this country 
receives a $1,200 direct payment, plus 
$500 for their kids. That is the least we 
can do. 
Let me be as clear as I can be. Today, 
as a result of the horrific pandemic and 
economic 
meltdown, 
the 
American 
working class is hurting in a way that 
has not been experienced since the 
Great Depression of the 1930s. 
In terms of public health, yesterday 
alone, over 220,000 Americans were di-
agnosed with COVID–19—yesterday— 
and tragically, over 3,000 died from this 
horrific virus. We are experiencing now 
some of the worst days in terms of 
cases being diagnosed, in terms of hos-
pitalization, in terms of death. That is 
where we are today. In other words, 
more Americans were killed by the 
coronavirus yesterday than were killed 
on 9/11. 
Tens of millions of our fellow citizens 
have lost their jobs as a result of the 
pandemic. They have lost their in-
comes. They have lost their health in-
surance. They have depleted their life 
savings. 
Let me tell you this: We deferred 
evictions. We prevented people from 
being evicted from their homes. But 
when at some point that deferment 
ends, all across the country, people are 
going to owe thousands and thousands 
of dollars to their landlords. They 
don’t have the money to pay them. 
Tens of millions of people are in danger 
of being evicted. 
You may have noticed that there 
were reports out there that hunger—

December 10, 2020 
this is the United States of America, 
the wealthiest country in the history 
of the world. We are looking at num-
bers that suggest that hunger is at the 
highest level we have seen in decades. 
Children in America are going hungry, 
and all across this country, tenants are 
worried that they are going to get a 
knock on the door from the sheriff 
evicting them from their homes or 
their apartments and throwing their 
belongings out on the street to join the 
other 500,000 Americans who are now 
homeless. 
In America today, over half of our 
workers are living paycheck-to-pay-
check, while one out of every four 
workers in this country is either unem-
ployed or earning an annual income of 
less than $20,000 a year. I don’t know 
how anybody makes it on less than 
$20,000 a year. 
During the holiday season to come, 
over one-third of Americans expect to 
lose income and are already having a 
difficult time paying for their basic 
household expenses. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention 
that, at a time when so many people in 
our economy are suffering, it has been 
far worse for the African-American and 
Latino communities. During this pan-
demic, nearly 60 percent of Latino fam-
ilies and 55 percent of African-Amer-
ican families have either experienced a 
job loss or a pay cut. That is just an 
unimaginable number. So the general 
population is suffering—even worse for 
the African-American and Latino com-
munities. 
I should also add that, in the midst of 
this pandemic, not everybody is suf-
fering. The people on top, some of the 
billionaires on top, are doing phenome-
nally well. Over the past 9 months of 
this pandemic, 650 billionaires—650, not 
a whole lot of people—have seen their 
wealth go up by over $1 trillion, during 
this pandemic, and now own over twice 
as much wealth as the bottom 50 per-
cent of American people. 
This is the United States of America, 
the richest country in the history of 
the world. No person in this great 
country should be going hungry. No 
person should live in fear of going 
homeless. No person in America should 
lack the healthcare they need when 
they or their kids get sick, especially 
in the midst of the worst public health 
crisis in 100 years. 
Can you imagine? I mean, it really is 
unimaginable that we are looking at 
220,000 people yesterday having been di-
agnosed with COVID–19, with the virus, 
and there are 90 million people in 
America who are either uninsured or 
underinsured, and they can’t even af-
ford to go to a doctor. But that is ex-
actly what is going on in America 
today. 
This is an unprecedented moment in 
American history, and the Senate 
needs to take unprecedented action to 
protect the working families of this 
country who are facing extreme eco-
nomic desperation. If we could act ef-
fectively in March through the CARES 
Act, we can act effectively today as we 
enter this holiday season. 
Once again, I very much appreciate 
the hard work that has gone into the 
current $908 billion proposal being 
worked on by a number of Democratic 
and Republican Senators, but, simply 
stated, given the horrific extent of the 
current crisis and the desperation of so 
many of our people, this proposal does 
not 
go 
anywhere—anywhere—far 
enough. 
In truth, rather than the $3.4 trillion 
which we on the Democratic side called 
for in the Heroes Act and passed in the 
House—the U.S. House of Representa-
tives a number of months ago passed a 
$3.4 trillion bill, but what is being dis-
cussed and negotiated right now with 
Democratic and Republican Senators 
only allocates $348 billion in new 
money. The remaining $560 billion are 
funds transferred from the CARES Act 
that have not yet been obligated. 
So what we are talking about now, as 
opposed to $3.4 trillion passed in the 
Heroes Act, is, roughly speaking, $348 
billion in new money right now. We are 
talking about, roughly speaking, 10 
percent of new money compared to 
what was passed in the House. That is 
absurd. That is unacceptable. I am pre-
pared to negotiate, but I cannot nego-
tiate in good faith when we are receiv-
ing 10 percent of new money compared 
to what was passed in the House in the 
Heroes bill. 
Unlike the CARES Act, which we 
passed unanimously in March, the pro-
posal now being negotiated only pro-
vides a $300 supplement for unemployed 
workers rather than $600 a week. Fur-
ther, unlike the $1,200 direct payment 
for every working-class individual and 
$500 for each child, this agreement 
being negotiated provides absolutely 
nothing—zero. Moreover, this proposal 
does nothing to address the healthcare 
crisis impacting tens of millions of 
Americans who cannot afford medical 
care and has totally inadequate finan-
cial assistance for the most vulnerable. 
The American people need help, and 
they need help now. In fact, there has 
never been a time in the modern his-
tory of this country when the Amer-
ican people were in more economic des-
peration and a time when people need-
ed help. If a government means any-
thing, it means that we cannot turn 
our backs on tens of millions of fami-
lies who today are suffering. So we 
have to make sure that every working 
individual in America receives at least 
$1,200 in direct payment. That is what 
we have to do. We cannot continue the 
status quo of simply coming in here to 
work and then going home and going 
back for our holiday. 
So I am going to do everything I can 
to insist that we make sure that every 
working person in this country gets a 
$1,200 direct payment, and we are not 
going to go home until that happens. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
H.R. 6395 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, the 
best part of any debate is when you see 
people twisting themselves in knots, 
going against their own alleged prin-
ciples to get their desired result. 
Today, the subject is war powers. The 
hawks and the neocons somehow want 
you to believe, in contrast to all logic, 
that the President of the United States 
has the unitary power to go to war 
anytime he wants, anywhere, free from 
interference from Congress. That is 
their stated position anytime war 
comes up. Yet, today, in the NDAA, 
they say they now want a President 
that cannot leave a war without their 
permission. 
How absurd is that? They believe 
that a President has the power go to 
war anywhere, anytime, but when a 
President tries to remove troops they 
say: Oh, no, no. What we really want 
are 535 generals in Congress to tell him 
he can’t leave a war. How absurd is 
that? 
It is exactly the opposite of what 
both the Constitution and logic would 
dictate. When Congress tried to impose 
time limits on troop engagements dur-
ing the Iraq war, the neocons squawked 
that it would be a mistake to have 535 
generals. They said the execution of 
the war was a prerogative of the Presi-
dent—until a President decided he 
wanted to leave a war. 
During 
the 
Bush 
administration, 
Dick Cheney and a team of legal apolo-
gists argued for something they call 
the unitary executive theory. Professor 
Edelson at American University de-
scribes this theory of an all-powerful 
Commander-in-Chief concept: This uni-
tary executive theory claimed to jus-
tify, 
effectively, 
unchecked 
Presi-
dential power over the use of military 
force, the detention and interrogation 
of prisoners, extraordinary rendition, 
and intelligence gathering. 
According to the unitary executive 
theory, since the Constitution assigns 
the President all of the executive 
power, he can set aside laws that at-
tempt to limit this power over national 
security. This is an enormous power. 
Critics say that it effectively puts the 
President above the law. But this is the 
belief of the neocons. They say: ‘‘The 
President is all-powerful,’’ until they 
say, ‘‘Well, unless the President is try-
ing to stop a war, then we must shack-
le the President with rules and regula-
tions and make sure that he cannot 
leave a war unless Congress says so.’’ 
That is what the NDAA will do this 
year. 
These same people who advocated for 
virtually 
unlimited 
Commander-in- 
Chief powers have put forth limits in 
this bill to restrain a President from 
removing troops from a country. Effec-
tively, these neocons put forth a belief 
that the Commander in Chief has vir-
tually unlimited power to initiate war, 
but 
they 
are 
just 
fine 
with 
hamstringing and preventing the Com-
mander in Chief from ending a war. 
Hypocrisy, anyone? Without a shred 
of embarrassment, these neocons hap-
pily constrain a President from leaving 
a war theater while they also simulta-
neously argue for a President who can

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7393 
December 10, 2020 
start war anytime, anywhere across 
the globe without congressional au-
thorization. 
Our 
Founding 
Fathers 
would be appalled. 
Primary among our Founders’ con-
cerns was that the power to initiate 
war not be in the hands of one person. 
As Madison wrote in the Federalist Pa-
pers, the executive is the branch of 
government most prone to war. There-
fore, the Constitution, with studied 
care, vested the war-making powers in 
the legislature. 
To our Founders, initiation of war 
was the sole prerogative of Congress. 
But a great deal of discretion was given 
to the President in article II to execute 
the war. The neocons forever believed 
in this discretion. They said the war 
shouldn’t be fought by 535 generals in 
Congress; we should give the President 
the freedom and power to execute the 
war. And, largely, they are correct— 
until they pop their heads up today and 
say, unless the President wants to stop 
a war, then we take it all back. What 
we really want is a President who can’t 
execute a war or execute the end of a 
war without the permission of Con-
gress. 
Likely, our Founders would have 
agreed with the common complaint 
that we don’t need 535 generals in Con-
gress. In other words, success in war re-
quires most decisions on executing the 
war to be in the hands of one person— 
the President. Even I, who have been 
opposed to most of the recent overseas 
activities and wars—even I believe that 
once Congress initiates it, most of the 
decisions should be made by the Presi-
dent. 
The decision to go to war requires 
the consensus, the initiation—the be-
ginning of war requires the consensus 
of 535 Members of Congress under the 
Constitution. It is very clear. They de-
bated it over and over, and they said: 
Initiation, declaration of war, should 
be done by Congress. But the execution 
of the war would largely be left up to 
the President. Many, many current and 
former Members of Congress have 
agreed. 
Representative LIZ CHENEY has ar-
gued that the nature of military and 
foreign policy demands the unity of the 
singular executive and that the Found-
ers certainly did not intend, nor does 
history substantiate, the idea that 
Congress should legislate specific lim-
its on the President’s powers in war-
time. 
LIZ CHENEY, who is also, ironically, 
the author of this amendment to the 
NDAA, said we shouldn’t limit the 
President’s powers in times of war and 
then she authors a limitation on the 
President removing troops from war. 
So which is it? I guess she is only for 
this unitary power—she is only for this 
all-powerful Commander in Chief when 
they fight war. But if a President 
wants to end a war, oh, no, Congress 
has to stop them at all costs from end-
ing a war. 
I think what comes out of this is that 
the neoconservative philosophy isn’t so 
much about a unitary executive, isn’t 
so much about an all-powerful Com-
mander in Chief, the philosophy of 
these people is about war and substan-
tiating war and making sure that it be-
comes and is perpetual war. 
Senator GRAHAM said the one thing 
he has been consistent on is that 
‘‘there is 1 Commander in Chief, not 
535’’ these are his words ‘‘and I believe 
this Commander in Chief and all future 
Commanders in Chief are unique in our 
Constitution and have an indispensable 
role to play when it comes to pro-
tecting the homeland. If we have 535 
commanders in chief, then we are going 
to be less safe.’’ 
I guess, except for this bill, which ac-
tually creates 535 generals in Congress 
to tell the President, not just this 
President—and some of it is anger. It is 
partisan anger. People don’t like Presi-
dent Trump—but this will bind all fu-
ture Presidents. This isn’t just about 
this President. 
When LINDSEY GRAHAM says we don’t 
want 535 Commanders in Chief, if this 
is his belief, he should vote against this 
bill because this bill creates 535 Com-
manders in Chief. 
The late Senator McCain said: ‘‘It 
would be a very serious situation where 
we now have 535 commanders in chief 
. . . the President of the United States 
is the only commander.’’ 
Senator INHOFE, the chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee, has said: 
‘‘We don’t need the 535 generals in Con-
gress telling our troops how to win this 
fight,’’ except for we are going to pass 
a bill that I assume all of these folks 
will vote for that actually creates 535 
generals in Congress to say to the 
President—to this one or any Presi-
dent—that he can’t leave the theater in 
Afghanistan without their permission. 
It is a tragedy; it is hypocrisy; and it is 
a terrible bill. 
Of course, there is also former Vice 
President Dick Cheney, who was ada-
mant that the War Powers Resolution, 
which requires the President to simply 
report to Congress on matters of war, 
was unconstitutional as ‘‘an infringe-
ment of the president’s authority as 
the commander in chief.’’ 
Senator ALEXANDER also said ‘‘there 
is a reason why we don’t have 535 com-
manders in chief or 100 commanding 
generals each saying charge down this 
street or over that hill.’’ 
I tend to agree, except for it seems to 
be one-sided. These people seem to be-
lieve that we shouldn’t have 535 gen-
erals in Congress when it is about initi-
ating war. But when it comes to re-
moving troops from the battle, when it 
comes to finally coming home after 
America’s longest war in Afghanistan, 
they all say: Oh, no, no, no. You are 
wrong. We are not going to let you 
come home. We are going to restrict 
and restrain the powers of the Com-
mander in Chief because we don’t want 
to end the Afghan war. 
It seems as if the only thing you can 
conclude is they really don’t care 
about their theory of an all-powerful 
Commander in Chief; they care more 
about perpetuating the Afghan war. 
Until recently, this chorus of voices 
sang of nothing but the almighty, end-
less powers that Presidents have as 
Commander in Chief. That is, until a 
President arrived on the scene who 
wanted to reduce overseas troop levels 
and end America’s longest war in Af-
ghanistan. Then the promoters of a 
strong Commander in Chief suddenly 
jumped ship and began advocating the 
opposite. They began advocating that 
535 Members of Congress should, in-
deed, become generals and should limit 
the 
President’s 
ability 
to 
remove 
troops from Afghanistan. 
Which is it? Are you for this unlim-
ited power of the President to com-
mence and execute war or are you only 
for it when they are initiating war, 
when they are continuing war, and 
against Presidential prerogative if the 
President chooses to end a war? 
Shouldn’t we call out this hypocrisy? 
Shouldn’t someone stand up and ex-
press and expose this rank dema-
goguery? Shouldn’t someone cry foul 
that the advocates of unlimited Presi-
dential power want it only to apply 
when that President advocates for war? 
But the moment a President advocates 
to end a war or lessen overseas troops 
and these deployments, he or she must 
be shackled by 535 generals. 
This Defense authorization bill could 
more aptly be called ‘‘A Bill to Prevent 
the President from Ending the Afghan 
War.’’ We never actually give the real 
titles to the bill, but that would be an 
accurate title: ‘‘A Bill to Prevent the 
President from Ending the Afghan 
War.’’ 
As such, any serious advocate for 
ending the Afghan war should vote 
against this monstrosity. The neocon 
advocates for Presidential war powers 
should own up to their hypocrisy and 
admit that their love of perpetual war 
trumps their oft-stated unitary execu-
tive theory. 
In reality, the neocons are enamored 
of their theory of unbounded Presi-
dential power only when that power is 
used to foment war. The minute a 
President decides to end war, the 
neocons’ true stripes are exposed as 
they beat their chest and proclaim—as 
535 generals might—that the President 
will not be allowed to remove troops 
without congressional permission. 
This bill sets a very dangerous prece-
dent for limiting a President’s power to 
end war and should be vigorously op-
posed.

DUCK BOAT SAFETY 
ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2019 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, July 19, 
2018, is a date that we in Missouri 
won’t ever forget. There were 17 people 
who lost their lives and 11 who were in-
jured in a boating accident on Table 
Rock Lake. During a severe thunder-
storm, a duck boat called Stretch Duck

7 sank with 31 people aboard, including 
children. Today marks 875 days since 
that tragedy. 
To the families and friends who lost 
loved ones that day, I am sure that 
every one of those 875 days since has 
come with a new and painful reminder 
of your loss. 
I am here today to honor those who 
lost their lives, the 17 victims of that 
tragedy—a tragedy that should never 
have happened—and also to honor the 
survivors who live with the memory of 
that tragedy every day. They deserve 
to be remembered. They deserve to be 
respected by this body, and I am here 
to do something about it. The time has 
come to act. 
I am here to ask this body to do its 
job and finally pass my bill that will 
impose tough, new security restric-
tions and measures on every duck boat 
operation in America. This is a bill I 
introduced almost 2 years ago that 
passed the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation unani-
mously. 
Now, truth be told, it has taken this 
body far too long to act. The tragedy in 
Missouri may have been one of the 
more recent duck boat tragedies, but it 
is far from the first. In 1999, 13 people 
were killed when a duck boat sank dur-
ing a tour of Lake Hamilton in Arkan-
sas. In the years since, the death toll 
has climbed to over 40. In 2001, there 
was a duck boat accident in Seattle, 
WA. In 2010, a tugboat on the Delaware 
River in Philadelphia collided with a 
duck boat. In 2013, a duck boat caught 
fire in the San Francisco Bay. I could 
go on. 
Now, the National Transportation 
Safety Board has issued numerous rec-
ommendations to improve duck boat 
safety, and it has issued many of these 
recommendations multiple times. The 
U.S. Coast Guard, which regulates 
these crafts, has recently concurred 
with quite a number of these rec-
ommendations. Yet, to be frank, we 
need more than recommendations. We 
need more than studies and surveys. 
We need laws. It has been 875 days, and 
we have seen investigation after inves-
tigation conclude the same thing: that 
lives could have been saved if action 
had been taken—if this body had acted, 
if the security measures had been put 
in place. 
The time for delay has passed, and 
the time to act is now in order to save 
future lives and to make sure that the 
tragedy that happened in Branson is 
not repeated again in Missouri or in 
any other State. 
My legislation would take those rec-
ommendations and put them into law. 
It includes provisions to ensure that 
duck boats remain buoyant during 
flooding. It requires dangerous can-
opies to be removed. It requires life 
jackets for passengers. My legislation 
would also ensure that duck boats 
would not go out during severe weather 
and also require the operators of duck 
boats to know what the weather is—a 
commonsense provision but one not 
currently required under the law. 
I thank Senator BLUNT, Senator COT-
TON, and Senator DUCKWORTH for sup-
porting this legislation and for their 
strong support for lifesaving provi-
sions. I thank Chairman WICKER for 
moving this bill through the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation, where, once again, it 
received unanimous support. Now it is 
time to make it the law of the land. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 1031 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1031) to implement recommenda-
tions related to the safety of amphibious 
passenger vessels, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I ask unanimous con-
sent 
that 
the 
Hawley 
substitute 
amendment be agreed to; that the bill, 
as amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 2698) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to, as 
follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Duck Boat 
Safety Enhancement Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR AMPHIB-
IOUS PASSENGER VESSELS. 
(a) SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS.— 
(1) BUOYANCY
REQUIREMENTS.—Not later 
than 1 year after the date of completion of a 
Coast Guard contracted assessment by the 
National Academies of Sciences, Engineer-
ing, and Medicine of the technical feasi-
bility, practicality, and safety benefits of 
providing reserve buoyancy through passive 
means on amphibious passenger vessels, the 
Secretary of the department in which the 
Coast Guard is operating may initiate a rule-
making to prescribe in regulations that oper-
ators of amphibious passenger vessels pro-
vide reserve buoyancy for such vessels 
through passive means, including watertight 
compartmentalization, built-in flotation, or 
such other means as the Secretary may 
specify in the regulations, in order to ensure 
that such vessels remain afloat and upright 
in the event of flooding, including when car-
rying a full complement of passengers and 
crew. 
(2) INTERIM REQUIREMENTS.—Not later than 
90 days after the date of enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of the department in 
which the Coast Guard is operating shall ini-
tiate a rulemaking to implement interim

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION 
ACT 
FOR 
FISCAL 
YEAR 
2021—Conference Report—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we 
all know, the clock is ticking down on 
coronavirus relief. Both the Senate and 
the House are set to wrap up the work 
of the 116th Congress in just a few days, 
but we don’t appear to be much closer 
to a deal now than we were this sum-
mer. 
Over the last few months, my col-
leagues and I on this side of the aisle 
have attempted to reach an agreement 
that could gain bipartisan support. We 
have proposed a number of targeted 
packages which have included funding 
for the most urgent bipartisan prior-
ities, things like vaccine development, 
schools, and the Paycheck Protection 
Program. We have tried to pass indi-
vidual proposals that have had near 
unanimous support, like a 1-week ex-
tension of unemployment insurance 
benefits. 
At every turn in the runup to the 
election, our Democratic colleagues 
have simply stood in the way. It is not 
just Republicans’ ideas they have re-
jected. The administration has repeat-
edly tried to negotiate with the Speak-
er, with the latest attempt being ear-
lier this week. Oddly enough, our 
Democratic colleagues have blasted the 
offer as being an attempt to obstruct 
negotiations. This is a parallel uni-
verse, where up is down and down is up, 
apparently, for our Democratic col-
leagues. 
Only in the Democrats’ alternate re-
alty is more compromise an example of 
obstruction. Based on everything we 
have seen so far, it appears they have 
no real interest in reaching a deal. And 
I conclude that only because they have 
stood in the way of every attempt so 
far to come to an agreement and seem 
perfectly content to maintain the sta-
tus quo, which nobody claims to like, 
even as the American people continue 
to call for additional support. 
Almost every Member of Congress 
has said they want to pass another re-
lief bill before the end of the year, but 
as we stand here today, we are empty-
handed despite the fact that we agree 
on a majority of what should be in that 
package. Republicans and Democrats 
agree that funding for schools, vac-
cines, the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, and assistance for the hardest 
hit Americans is desperately needed. 
But there appear to be two hangups in 
the negotiations: liability protections 
and State and local aid. 
I think it is safe to say, in all fair-
ness to our Democratic friends, they 
just don’t support liability protections, 
whether it is for healthcare workers, 
hospitals, schools, churches, or non-
profits that can be hit with a wave of 
litigation unless we act. And we know 
on this side of the aisle Republicans 
don’t support hundreds of billions of 
dollars of new money to bail out cities 
and States that have been mismanaged 
for decades. 
With neither side willing to budge, 
Leader MCCONNELL made the only rea-
sonable suggestion I have heard in 
light of the stalemate. He said that set-
ting these two issues aside seems to 
make sense so we can do what we can 
do and include all the things we agree 
on in the coming days while we hold off 
those more controversial pieces until 
the start of the next year. 
Our friends across the aisle appar-
ently have never heard of the 80–20 
rule, and that makes sense, I guess, in 
this alternate reality where NANCY 
PELOSI
said that ‘‘nothing is better 
than something.’’ I have never heard 
anyone say that before. It is rather 
shocking to me. 
Based on their reception of the long 
list of proposals so far this year, I am 
sure it will come as no surprise that 
they have basically rejected any en-
treaties that we have made. It is clear 
to me that they aren’t approaching 
these negotiations by asking what is 
best for the 330 million people in this 
country; their concern appears to be 
what is best for them politically—cer-
tainly in the runup to the election, 
where they denied the American people 
the benefits of another COVID–19 relief 
bill—or when it comes to liability pro-
tection, the trial lawyers. 
Now, I am a recovering lawyer my-
self. I don’t hold a grudge against law-
yers earning a living. But the fact is, 
we ought to be concerned about the 
American people and not lawyers, who, 
I dare say, are probably doing pretty 
well relative to those who aren’t get-
ting a paycheck or are in lockdowns at 
home. 
So our Democratic colleagues have 
employed the same all-or-nothing ap-
proach that has been their hallmark, 
and, as the American people have 
learned over and over again, it almost 
always leads to nothing. I mean, so 
much of this is so obvious, it seems to 
me, you almost are embarrassed to say 
it, but when your attitude is ‘‘all or 
nothing,’’ you usually end up with 
nothing. And that is where we are 
today—no unemployment benefit ex-
tension, no funding for schools, no 
money for vaccine distribution, no sec-
ond draw on the Paycheck Protection 
Program. Nothing. Zip. Nada. 
Our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
have 
proven over and over again that either 
they don’t want to negotiate or they 
have forgotten how. They aren’t inter-
ested in compromise, which is the only 
way you get things done here. It sounds 
like they are more interested in mes-
saging than they are in actually 
achieving a result—making a law, 
something the President will sign after 
it passes both Houses. 
So our colleagues need to make a de-
cision, and they need to make it quick-
ly. Are they willing to work with us 
and send a bill to the President that in-
cludes most of what they would like to 
see in a relief bill, if not all, or are 
they willing to tank everything—fund-
ing for State and local government, 
vaccines, schools, small businesses, 
families who are hurting and anxious 
and in financial distress? Are they will-
ing to throw them under the bus if they 
can’t get everything they want? Again, 
the choice seems so obvious to me. I 
am sorry I have to say it, but it has be-
come obvious that, so far, Democratic 
leadership has no interest in resolving 
these negotiations in a way that gets 
them most of what they want without 
taking the risk that we end up empty-
handed. 
TRIBUTE TO PAT ROBERTS 
Mr President, this morning, during 
the remarks by the senior Senator 
from Kansas, I was stuck in the Judici-
ary Committee, and so I wasn’t able to 
be here, although I have read and heard 
reported back to me some of the best 
moments of his remarks, and I just 
wanted to come here to the floor and 
say a few words about our friend PAT 
ROBERTS as we prepare to bid him fare-
well. 
PAT has represented the people of 
Kansas for four decades—16 years in 
the House and 24 years here in the Sen-
ate—and I bet it seems like a blink of 
an eye. During that time, he has estab-
lished himself as a national leader—in 
agriculture in particular—a dependable

voice for rural Americans, and an un-
wavering advocate for our Nation’s 
servicemembers, as you would expect a 
former marine to be. But he has also 
been a source of great comedic relief in 
a place where people often take them-
selves too seriously. 
A few years ago, during a Senate Fi-
nance Committee hearing, we heard 
PAT’s cell phone ringing. Much to ev-
eryone’s enjoyment, it wasn’t a fac-
tory-set ring tone; it was the song ‘‘Let 
It Go’’ from the Disney movie ‘‘Fro-
zen.’’ When he was asked if he had seen 
the stage adaptation, he equipped: ‘‘I 
might even be in it.’’ 
Well, his acting chops are clearly not 
adequate for Broadway, but there is 
certainly enough to impress those of us 
here in this Chamber. He has a great 
Marlon Brando impression and a knack 
for injecting quotes from the movie 
‘‘On the Waterfront’’ at the perfect mo-
ment. And we all know that he is a 
great country music fan, particularly 
of Ray Price. 
PAT is happy to entertain just about 
anyone who will listen to his talent for 
storytelling, and I know members of 
my staff have enjoyed learning about 
his time in the Marine Corps—at least 
those PG-rated moments. 
It is fitting that Washington Maga-
zine has given him the title of ‘‘Fun-
niest Senator,’’ a number of times even 
referring to him as the ‘‘Senate’s Jay 
Leno.’’ You never know what PAT is 
going to say, but it is invariably enter-
taining and always amusing. 
As much as we are going to miss his 
frequent jokes and clever one-liners, 
we are going to miss his steadfast lead-
ership and friendship even more—as I 
said earlier, especially when it comes 
to his advocacy on behalf of farmers 
and ranchers and folks who put the 
food on our tables and the clothes on 
our backs. 
PAT has had his hand and his finger-
prints on every Agriculture bill for the 
last four decades. Those farm bills are 
tough—trying to marry up the inter-
ests of urban folks and food stamps and 
things like that along with the needs of 
our production agriculture, our farm-
ers and ranchers. He was the first per-
son to chair the Agriculture Com-
mittee in both the House and the Sen-
ate, as well as the first to write and 
pass a farm bill in both Chambers. He 
has been an unrelenting champion for 
our Nation’s farmers and ranchers and 
producers, and Texas agriculture has 
benefited, too, from his work to remove 
trade barriers and burdensome regula-
tions that have threatened their com-
petitiveness or, in some cases, their 
survival. 
While 
PAT’s 
accomplishments 
as 
chairman of the Agriculture Com-
mittee are among his most celebrated, 
his remarkable career in public service 
has led to a long list of wins for the 
American people. He has led efforts to 
help 
improve 
access 
to 
quality 
healthcare for all Americans. He has 
helped keep taxes low and improve eco-
nomic opportunities for families all 
across the country. And, of course, he 
has advocated for our servicemembers 
and our veterans. PAT even chaired the 
Senate Intelligence Committee for a 
time, and he helped to identify sys-
temic problems in the intelligence 
community and enact critical reforms. 
Finally, in a great labor of love, 
which seems like, I am sure, it has 
taken decades to accomplish, a few 
months ago, PAT was able to see his 
decades-long fight come to a satisfying 
conclusion when the Dwight David Ei-
senhower Memorial was completed. 
This incredible monument to our 34th 
President would not have been possible 
without PAT ROBERTS. He has worked 
on it for the last 20 years, most of it 
behind the scenes, and it seems like the 
perfect culmination of his service in 
Congress. 
While PAT’s sense of humor and devo-
tion to public service are often on pub-
lic display, members of our Senate 
community have also come to know of 
the size of his heart. He has got a big 
one. When a former member of PAT’s 
staff unexpectedly passed away this 
last year, he was there to comfort the 
family and friends and share wonderful 
stories about Chris in a speech at his 
memorial service, because when you 
work for PAT ROBERTS—or I should say 
with PAT ROBERTS—you are not just a 
cog in a policymaking or legislative 
machine; you are family. 
You would be hard-pressed to find a 
better friend to Kansans, a more de-
voted ally for our farmers and ranch-
ers, a bigger K-State fan, or a more 
loved Member of the Senate than our 
friend PAT ROBERTS. There is no ques-
tion we will miss him and the countless 
laughs he has provided over the years, 
but I know he is eager to spend more 
time in greener pastures with his won-
derful wife Franki. PAT has earned a 
well-deserved retirement, and I know 
he is looking forward to spending more 
time with his and Franki’s children 
and growing number of grandchildren. 
PAT, we wish you well.

for the rule of law and of the constitutional 
regimes of the member states of the Organi-
zation of American States’’. 
(3) Article 26 of the Inter-American Demo-
cratic Charter states that ‘‘the OAS will con-
tinue to carry out programs and activities 
designed to promote democratic principles 
and practices and strengthen a democratic 
culture in the Hemisphere’’. 
(4) In accordance with the OAS Charter 
and the Inter-American Democratic Charter, 
the OAS General Assembly, OAS Permanent 
Council, and OAS Secretariat have estab-
lished a wide range of cooperative agree-
ments with domestic and international orga-
nizations, including national legislative in-
stitutions. 
(5) In 2004, OAS General Assembly Resolu-
tion 2044 (XXXIV–O/04) appealed for the 
‘‘strengthening of legislatures, as well as 
inter-parliamentary 
cooperation 
on 
key 
items of the inter-American agenda, with a 
view, in particular, to generating initiatives 
to fight corruption, poverty, inequality, and 
social exclusion’’. 
(6) In 2005, OAS General Assembly Resolu-
tion 2095 (XXXV–O/05) called on the OAS Sec-
retariat to ‘‘invite [. . .] the presidents or 
speakers of the national legislative institu-
tions of the Americas, i.e., congresses, par-
liaments, or national assemblies, [. . .] to at-
tend a special meeting of the Permanent 
Council [. . .] for the initiation of a dialogue 
on topics on the hemispheric agenda’’. 
(7) In 2014 and 2015, the OAS Secretariat ex-
panded its engagement with elected national 
legislators from OAS member states by con-
vening two meetings of presidents of na-
tional legislatures, first in Lima, Peru and 
subsequently in Santiago, Chile. 
(8) However, no permanent procedures 
exist to facilitate the participation of elect-
ed national legislators from OAS member 
states in OAS activities. 
(9) The Organization for Security and Co- 
operation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary 
Assembly has proven successful at strength-
ening 
inter-parliamentary 
cooperation 
among its member states. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is that sense of Congress that— 
(1) elected national legislators play an es-
sential role in the exercise of representative 
democracy in the Americas, including by— 
(A) promoting economic freedom and re-
spect for property rights; 
(B) promoting the rule of law and com-
bating corruption; 
(C) defending human rights and funda-
mental freedoms; and 
(D) advancing the principles and practices 
expressed in the Charter of the Organization 
of American States, the American Declara-
tion on the Rights and Duties of Man, and 
the Inter-American Democratic Charter; 
(2) establishing procedures and mecha-
nisms to facilitate the participation of elect-
ed national legislators from OAS member 
states in OAS activities could contribute to 
the promotion of democratic principles and 
practices and strengthen a democratic cul-
ture in the Western Hemisphere; 
(3) increasing and strengthening the par-
ticipation of elected national legislators 
from OAS member states in OAS activities 
could advance the principles and proposals 
expressed in section 4 of the Organization of 
American States Revitalization and Reform 
Act of 2013 (Public Law 113–41; 127 Stat. 549); 
(4) the OAS General Assembly, OAS Per-
manent Council, and OAS Secretariat should 
take steps to facilitate greater participation 
of elected national legislators from OAS 
member states in OAS activities; 
(5) the OAS Permanent Council resolutions 
titled ‘‘Guidelines for the Participation of 
Civil Society in OAS Activities’’ and ‘‘Strat-
egies for Increasing and Strengthening Par-
ticipation by Civil Society Organizations in 
OAS Activities’’ should serve as important 
references for efforts to bolster the partici-
pation of elected national legislators from 
OAS member states in OAS activities; and 
(6) the successful experience of the Organi-
zation for Security and Co-operation in Eu-
rope Parliamentary Assembly should serve 
as a model to the OAS in creating a similar 
mechanism. 
SEC. 4. STRENGTHENING PARTICIPATION OF 
ELECTED NATIONAL LEGISLATORS 
AT THE OAS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of State, 
acting through the United States Mission to 
the Organization of American States, should 
use the voice and vote of the United States 
to support the creation of procedures for the 
Organization of American States that— 
(1) enhance the participation of democrat-
ically elected national legislators from OAS 
member state countries in OAS activities 
that advance the principles of the Inter- 
American Democratic Charter and the core 
values of the OAS consistent with the prin-
ciples and proposals expressed in section 4 of 
the Organization of American States Revi-
talization and Reform Act of 2013 (Public 
Law 113–41; 127 Stat. 549); 
(2) create an annual forum for democrat-
ically elected national legislatures from OAS 
member states to discuss issues of hemi-
spheric importance, including regional ef-
forts to defend human rights and combat 
transnational criminal activities, corrup-
tion, and impunity; 
(3) permit elected national legislators from 
OAS member states to make presentations, 
contribute information, and provide expert 
advice, as appropriate, to the OAS Secre-
tariat, OAS Permanent Council, and OAS 
General Assembly about OAS activities on 
issues of hemispheric importance; 
(4) lead to the creation of a mechanism to 
regularly facilitate the participation of 
elected national legislators in OAS activi-
ties; and 
(5) reinforce OAS Secretariat programs 
that provide technical assistance for the 
modernization and institutional strength-
ening of national legislatures from OAS 
member states.

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know 
of no further debate on the bill, as 
amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the bill having 
been read the third time, the question 
is, Shall the bill pass?

tinued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I see that 
my colleague and classmate is here on 
the floor. I got to hear his speech ear-
lier today, and it was one of the best 
speeches that he has given and the best 
instruction that all of us should listen 
to. 
He has far more experience than just 
the time that he was a classmate with 
me, because he served in the House as 
well. He is Mr. Agriculture and has 
solved a lot of problems in those areas, 
and it has been a pleasure to be here 
with him. And I leave with him. He has 
done an outstanding job. 
We also like some of the same lit-
erature. 
THE BUDGET 
Mr. President, it has been an honor 
to serve as the chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee for the past 6 years. 
There is no question that these have 
been challenging times. They have cul-
minated in the current pandemic that 
we continue to confront. Throughout 
all of these challenges, I am proud to 
say that the committee has played a 
key role in working to address the fis-
cal challenges facing our Nation. We 
put in place policies that helped grow 
our economy and improve the congres-
sional budget process. 
Now I need to make a clarification 
for anybody who might be listening. 
The Budget Committee is not the 
spending committee. That is the Ap-
propriations Committee. The Budget 
Committee does a roadmap that is sup-
posed to provide some discipline for the 
people doing the spending. That is 
where we need to do a lot more work. 
I want to start off by telling you a 
little 
budget 
story. 
My 
youngest 
daughter and her family are strict 
budgeters. They follow Dave Ramsey’s 
principles, and the whole family par-
ticipates in monthly allocation of their 
resources. It has made a huge dif-
ference in their ability to pay off 
things and to enjoy life. 
A year ago, my older daughter picked 
up my granddaughters from their after- 
school activities and said: How would 
you like to go to McDonald’s for din-
ner? Of course, they were thrilled. 
My daughter said: Well, maybe we 
ought to call your parents and see if 
they would like it too. 
At this point the older daughter, who 
I think was 11 at the time, said: Who is 
paying? 
And she said: I am. 
She said: Oh, OK, because we have al-
ready used our eating-out budget. 
That is family participation in budg-
eting. 
As a result, I also have the youngest 
granddaughter, who saved up for an 
Apple watch. Do you know how much 
restraint of spending that is so you can 
reach the goal that you want and buy 
what you really need? That is good 
budgeting. 
We can do good budgeting, but we 
have to have good appropriations to 
follow it up too. 
The committee has had some real 
successes over the past 6 years. 
We passed four budgets, including the 
first balanced 10-year blueprint ap-
proved by Congress since 2001. 
We also played a key role in helping 
pass the most sweeping update of our 
Nation’s tax system in more than 30 
years. The passage of the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act started with the approval of 
the FY 2018 Senate Budget Resolution. 
That resolution started the process to 
construct legislation that reduced tax 
rates for millions of Americans and 
modernized our antiquated Tax Code. 
It also supported responsible energy de-
velopment that will keep energy af-
fordable and provide a long-term sup-
ply for American energy. 
Oversight was also a critical part of 
the committee’s work. During my time 
as chairman, we worked to ensure the 
Federal Government was accountable 
to the public by boosting transparency, 
by improving Federal financial man-
agement, by identifying duplication of 
Federal programs, and by approving 
Federal information technology. 
Increasing the transparency of our 
congressional budget process has also 
been a major priority. After becoming 
chairman, I restarted the practice of 
publicly releasing regular scorekeeping 
reports—which we publish on our com-
mittee website—that show how we 
spent the money. More recently, we de-
veloped information on the budgetary 
effects of the various COVID–19 bills. 
We can get those online.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7399 
December 10, 2020 
Providing information like this on an 
ongoing basis is one more tool for com-
mittees and taxpayers alike to see how 
the current law stacks up against the 
budget we are required to adhere to. 
Scorekeeping reports operate just like 
regular checkups with the dentist or 
doctor to help identify risks and find 
solutions before more serious problems 
emerge. 
In 2015, we also began regular public 
oversight hearings with the Congres-
sional Budget Office. This was the first 
CBO oversight hearing in more than 30 
years. Because of our efforts, CBO now 
regularly publicly releases informa-
tion, tracking its forecasting records, 
the accuracy of estimates and projec-
tions, and the data it uses in its work. 
While we have had some successes, 
there are still many serious challenges 
facing 
our 
Nation. 
Even 
before 
coronavirus came to our shores, our 
country 
was 
moving 
down 
an 
unsustainable fiscal path. The pan-
demic has only accelerated this, with 
Congress approving COVID relief legis-
lation that would add more than $2.6 
trillion to our debt so far. In the near- 
term this spending, necessary as it 
may have been, translated into an 
overall deficit of $3.1 trillion in fiscal 
year 2020, more than triple the amount 
recorded 
the 
previous 
fiscal 
year. 
CBO’s most recent ‘‘Long-Term Budget 
Outlook’’ paints an even more dire pic-
ture of deficits and debt rising to un-
precedented levels if current laws re-
main unchanged—and this represents 
the best-case scenario. 
For decades, CBO, the Government 
Accountability Office, economists, and 
Members of Congress have been raising 
the alarm that if we continued on this 
course, our debt would explode with po-
tentially devastating economic con-
sequences, leaving us unable to fulfill 
the promises of the past. That day al-
ways seemed a long time away. But 
time waits for no one, and tomorrow is 
fast arriving. 
By 2023, barely 2 years away, CBO 
projects that debt as a percentage of 
GDP will reach an all-time high of 107 
percent. By 2050, debt could reach 195 
percent of gross domestic product— 
which is the amount of actual produc-
tion we do in the United States—and 
the annual deficit would reach 12.6 per-
cent of GDP. That is where the tax 
money comes from. 
Spending as a percent of GDP will 
rise 31.2 percent by 2050, primarily due 
to—this is very important—due to ris-
ing Social Security, healthcare costs, 
and net interest spending. 
CBO projects that net interest spend-
ing will exceed all discretionary spend-
ing in 2043 and will exceed Social Secu-
rity by 2046. By 2050, spending on inter-
est will be larger than any single pro-
gram. That is the interest on the debt. 
That doesn’t pay down any debt. That 
is just the interest on the debt. By 2050, 
it will be the single largest program. 
Now, that is assuming we continue 
with the extremely low interest rates 
that we get now. We are not even close 
to the national average. We are way 
below the national average. The na-
tional average would be 5 percent. If 
that were to happen, the only thing we 
would be able to fund would be interest 
on the national debt. You didn’t hear 
me mention Social Security or Medi-
care or education or military or any of 
those things. That is why I have been 
mentioning this so often. Interest will 
eat us alive. 
The amazing part of everything I just 
said is that this is the rosy scenario. 
Increases in spending or interest rates 
that are higher than the low rates as-
sumed by CBO means that the out-
comes are more severe than currently 
recorded. CBO expects rising deficits 
will have major negative economic 
consequences, including lower invest-
ment and output and a greater chance 
of a fiscal crisis. CBO notes that high 
and rising debt would also constrain 
policymakers’ ability to borrow in re-
sponse to future unforeseen emer-
gencies, leaving the United States vul-
nerable in the face of potential disas-
ters while also risking our national se-
curity. 
CBO is the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, and it is a nonpartisan office that 
helps to make these evaluations. As I 
mentioned earlier, we are actually 
holding them accountable by having 
them come in and explain what they 
projected and how it matches up with 
what actually happens. So we should 
pay attention to them. I actually think 
that they come up with fairly low num-
bers. 
I don’t want to leave this body with 
nothing but doom and gloom. It is not 
too late to turn things around. We can 
be successful if we work together. 
Contrary to what most people believe 
about Congress and what is reported in 
the media, I know both parties can 
work together. I have seen it firsthand 
as a member of the Senate Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee and my work with Senator Ted 
Kennedy and, again, here on the Senate 
Budget Committee and my work with 
Senators WHITEHOUSE, KAINE, WARNER, 
KING, VAN HOLLEN, and others. 
Bipartisanship will be key as Con-
gress works to tackle our fiscal chal-
lenges. Instilling the Federal budget 
process with regular action and pre-
dictability, active legislative oversight 
and spending transparency—that is all 
critical to strengthening our democ-
racy 
and 
reducing 
our 
Nation’s 
unsustainable spending and debt. 
Since taking the helm of the Com-
mittee, we have held more than a dozen 
hearings on the topic of budget process 
reform, soliciting expert testimony 
from a variety of sources, including 
economists, academics, State and local 
leaders, former chairs of the Budget 
Committee, and even people from other 
countries. This has been one of my top 
priorities as chairman, and we have 
had some early successes in this effort. 
This includes the committee’s unani-
mous bipartisan approval of new budg-
et rules that included budget process 
reforms, which have led to more or-
derly, 
meaningful, 
and 
transparent 
consideration of the budget resolutions 
in the committee. We followed those 
hearings by introducing and passing 
legislation, the Bipartisan Congres-
sional Budget Reform Act, which rep-
resented the first bipartisan budget re-
form approved by the Senate Budget 
Committee since 1990. 
I want to repeat that. In a bipartisan 
way, we passed a Congressional Budget 
Reform Act, and it represented the 
first bipartisan reforms approved by 
the Senate Budget Committee since 
1990. A key focus of budget process re-
form is to make congressional budgets 
easier to pass and harder to ignore, 
while encouraging regular order in the 
normal funding process. If budgets are 
going to be a useful governing tool, 
they must matter. Budgets are the 
foundation by which we govern, the 
way we establish what matters most to 
our Nation, and where we agree limited 
resources should be focused. 
We have seen time and again that 
when budgets are treated as an after-
thought or as a wish list, our ability to 
legislate effectively and fulfill our 
most basic constitutional duties is 
made more difficult, if not impossible. 
To restore budgets to their proper 
role, they must be enforceable, and 
they should increase fiscal account-
ability in Congress. If lawmakers ap-
prove a budget, they should stick to it. 
To that end, my bipartisan budget 
process reform legislation would make 
a number of important reforms, includ-
ing creating a new enforcement tool 
that could be used only for reducing 
the deficit. I realize that we may not 
get this bill across the finish line be-
fore I complete my service, but I hope 
others will take up the effort and en-
sure the key parts, including fiscal ac-
countability, are included in future re-
forms. I have had the assurance from 
both Members on this side of the aisle 
and the other side of the aisle that that 
is a possibility and a priority. 
Next year, lawmakers will be con-
fronted with the construction of a new 
budget and spending bills, and for the 
first time in almost a decade, it will be 
without spending caps. We have had 
some self-imposed limits on our spend-
ing before called spending caps, and it 
has been very irritating to people who 
want to spend money. But now they 
can do that because this will be the 
first time in almost a decade without 
the spending caps contained in the 
Budget Control Act. 
Of course, even under the Budget 
Control Act, Congress regularly ig-
nored the fiscal limits it contained, but 
starting next year, there will be no 
budget caps to guide overall funding 
levels or to curb Federal discretionary 
spending—no limits. This could be and 
should be a cause for great concern, 
but it is also a chance for us to work 
together to find a way to begin the 
process to address our fiscal chal-
lenges. 
Of course, I mentioned that that is 
just curbing the Federal discretionary

spending. That is the little dab of 
money that the appropriators actually 
get to make a decision on, and 70 per-
cent of what we do is already passed 
without a single vote from this body. 
And that number—we keep trying to 
shift discretionary things over to man-
datory so people can be assured that 
the money will be spent, but seldom do 
we ever put any money with the new 
mandatory item. 
But beyond the annual funding fight, 
our 
country 
faces 
an 
even 
more 
daunting fiscal crisis: the rapidly ap-
proaching depletion of several Federal 
trust funds. That includes the Highway 
Trust Fund next year. It also includes 
Medicare’s Hospital Insurance Trust 
Fund. We have 4 years on that, 2024. 
There is the Disability Insurance Trust 
Fund, 2026, and the Old-Age and Sur-
vivors Insurance Trust Fund, 2031. 
Those are trust funds that are ap-
proaching depletion, running out of 
money. 
OK. In the CBO’s latest baseline, 
total scheduled spending for all pend-
ing trust fund programs will exceed 
their dedicated revenues by $12.3 tril-
lion over the next 10 years. This ac-
counts for the majority of the $13 tril-
lion 
in 
cumulative 
deficits 
CBO 
projects the Nation will run over this 
period—depletion of the trust funds. 
What happens when these trust funds 
run dry? Current law requires their 
spending to automatically be reduced 
to match their income. This means real 
cuts to crucial programs. I mentioned 
Social Security. It would have to go 
down to the amount of money that we 
actually receive going out to recipients 
of Social Security. That could be a big 
and immediate hurt. 
So, again, a real challenge awaits 
next Congress as my tenure comes to a 
close. I am proud of what the Senate 
Budget Committee accomplished. We 
helped to improve the fiscal health of 
millions of Americans by passing the 
most comprehensive tax reform in a 
generation. We have also committed 
ourselves to working to improve the 
congressional budget process so Wash-
ington and Congress can get a better 
handle on what we are spending and 
where it is going, including a new tool 
that could be used only for reducing 
the deficit. We have worked to boost 
fiscal transparency, improve Federal 
financial management, identify dupli-
cation of Federal programs, and im-
prove Federal information technology. 
But there is much more that needs to 
be done, and now those challenges will 
be passed to the next chairman. 
While I have highlighted the prob-
lems, I am also leaving a roadmap with 
possible paths forward. I would ask all 
of my colleagues to work closely to-
gether to address these issues, as we 
can no longer push them off for some-
one else to fix later. We need to find 
the common ground. Tomorrow is here, 
and we have to start making those 
choices not only for ourselves but for 
our kids and our grandkids and our 
country.

need help, and they need it right now. 
I am glad that bipartisan discussions 
are continuing. I think it is very posi-
tive, and I know that many of us are 
involved in those negotiations. I com-
mend all of my colleagues who are 
working very hard to get this done. 
It is critical that we come to an 
agreement that will help families and 
that will help businesses and commu-
nities get through this rough time, but 
time is running out, as we know. Our 
Nation is facing a crisis. Our States 
and local governments are facing a cri-
sis as they are trying to gear up for an 
effective and rapid distribution of vac-
cines. Our local police officers, fire-
fighters, public health workers, and 
other essential workers face layoffs. 
The only real possibility that I see of 
defunding the police is the unwilling-
ness, so far, by the majority leader to 
support funding local law enforcement 
in the COVID–19 emergency package 
that we are trying to get done. We all 
know that businesses and workers and 
families are facing a crisis. 
We simply can’t wrap up this session, 
we can’t end this session and go home 
without responding to the urgent needs 
of the American people. 
It has now been 1 week since the last 
time I was on the floor speaking about 
the need for more help. In the past 
week, more than 1 million additional 
people in the United States have be-
come infected, and an additional 13,000 
people in the United States have died 
because of COVID–19—13,000 moms and 
dads, 
grandpas 
and 
grandmas 
and 
friends and neighbors. We have now 
seen nearly 290,000 of our family mem-
bers and friends and neighbors die of 
this horrible disease. That is like if the 
entire population of Grand Rapids and 
Flint, MI, simply disappeared. 
Meanwhile, millions of families at 
risk of eviction are 1 week closer to 
finding themselves without a home in 
the winter in the middle of a health 
pandemic. Millions of small business 
owners have spent 1 more week scram-
bling to keep their workers on the pay-
roll. Families don’t have enough to eat, 
and they have spent 1 more week won-
dering where their next meal is going 
to come from for themselves and for 
their children. 
A week is a long time to wait when 
you are in danger of being homeless or 
losing your job or being hungry or 
watching your child who is hungry. We 
are running out of time. We are run-
ning out of time, and so many Amer-
ican businesses, workers, and families 
are running out of time. 
On December 26, only 16 days from 
now—16 days from now, the day after 
Christmas—vital unemployment pro-
grams will end, cutting off benefits 
that millions of workers need to pro-
vide for their families. Somebody who 
is self-employed, a contract worker, a 
gig worker, they will receive zero help 
after that to feed their families and put 
a roof over their head and pay the bills 
through this pandemic. 
Five days after that, on December 31, 
the Federal Reserves’ emergency lend-
ing program ends. That will cut off cru-
cial credit that is keeping businesses 
open and helping State and local gov-
ernments provide necessary services. 
Also on December 31, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention’s evic-
tion moratorium ends, putting more 
people on the street. The Federal fore-
closure moratorium and some opportu-
nities for forbearance expire. 
It is cold in Michigan right now, and 
it is going to get colder. Imagine how 
frightening it would be to know that 
your family is losing their home in the 
middle of a pandemic in the middle of 
the winter. 
The truth is, our Nation is not facing 
just a health crisis; we are facing an 
economic crisis; we are facing a hous-
ing crisis; we are facing a hunger crisis 
all at the same time. 
These expiring programs have been a 
lifeline for families, for communities, 
and for businesses during the pan-
demic. That lifeline is now fraying, and 
a lack of action here in Washington 
could cause it to completely snap. 
There is a lot of talk about numbers 
right now, and numbers are important, 
but much more important are the peo-
ple who need help. They are not num-
bers. I am thinking of a Michigan mom 
of two growing boys who has been wait-
ing hours in a line of cars, week after 
week, to bring home a box of food. I am 
thinking of a Michigan dad who has 
been looking so hard for a new job, but 
nobody wants to be hiring right now, 
and his unemployment help is almost 
out. I am thinking of the owner of a 
Michigan business who had no choice 
but to lay off half of their workers 
right before the holidays. I am think-
ing of a Michigan retiree who is behind 
on her rent. She could move in with 
her daughter’s family, but their home 
is already crowded, and she doesn’t 
want to be a burden, and we are in the 
middle of a pandemic where we are 
telling people to socially distance to be 
safe. 
While we are debating, people are 
suffering and panicking because they 
are not sure what they are going to do. 
People can’t wait another week, and we 
cannot either. 
This is the United States of America. 
It is not like we don’t have the capac-
ity to fix this right now. It is all about 
political will. It is about, do we get it? 
Do we care about people? Do we under-
stand what is happening to people? And

are we willing to support the bipar-
tisan effort going on right now that 
can do something—at least provide a 
bridge for a few months, through the 
winter months, into the new year? 
There is an opportunity going on. 
There is a lot of hard work going on. 
There is no excuse not to take this mo-
ment and to come together and provide 
help in what is a COVID survival pack-
age for people in Michigan and across 
the country. That is what this is. 
We are at a moment where it is up to 
us to make sure that we get this done, 
and if not, we should not end this ses-
sion until we do. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING JOE MORGAN 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, Arkan-
sas is known as the Natural State, and 
few have been more dedicated to pre-
serving Arkansas in all of its natural 
beauty than was Joe Morgan. 
Joe passed away last month at the 
age of 76. Joe was a lifelong Arkansan. 
He studied at Little Rock University— 
now the University of Arkansas-Little 
Rock—and he worked for many years 
as a car dealer for great American com-
panies like General Motors and Chev-
rolet. He also served on the Arkansas 
Motor Vehicle Commission. 
But Joe will probably be remembered 
most for his tireless advocacy on behalf 
of Arkansas’ natural heritage and envi-
ronment. 
Governor 
Hutchinson 
ap-
pointed Joe to the Arkansas Game and 
Fish Commission, where he quickly es-
tablished himself as a champion for Ar-
kansas duck hunters and the wilder-
ness upon which they rely. 
Joe hunted and fished in Stuttgart, 
the duck capital of the world. As a 
member of the commission, he made it 
his mission to ensure duck hunting re-
mained a gentleman’s sport and to pre-
serve the hunting grounds he knew and 
loved so they would be available to fu-
ture generations of Arkansans. 
He was especially passionate about 
preserving Bayou Meto Waterfowl Man-
agement Area, one of the crown jewels 
of duck hunting in Arkansas. 
He 
was 
instrumental 
in 
imple-
menting safe boating regulations to 
protect hunters and waterfowl popu-
lations alike. He imposed time limits 
on when boats could be out on the 
water to preserve the health and sus-
tainability of the duck population. 
Joe’s first priority was always to his 
fellow Arkansans. He pressed for limits 
on when nonresidents could hunt to en-
sure that locals were never pushed out 
of the hunting spots they grew up with. 
Joe’s fellow commissioners will re-
member him as a dogged defender of 
hunting and fishing in Arkansas. His 
wife of 56 years, Judy, and his son, 
Brett, will remember him as a loving 
husband and father who was always 
ready with a joke—and always ready 
for a good shoot, a round of golf, or 
even a jaunt in his trusty Cessna 182. 
As for me, I will remember Joe as a 
friend. I met Joe in my early cam-
paigns, and we became fast friends. We 
talked and texted often. He even hosted 
me, with friends, in North Carolina to 
speak about Republican politics. 
Joe Morgan may have left us, but he 
left his heart in Arkansas—in the well- 
stocked, flooded timber of Bayou Meto, 
which he helped to preserve. 
In a fitting tribute to his legacy, Joe 
passed away on the opening day for 
duck hunting in Arkansas. Every hun-
ter who enjoys Arkansas’ natural beau-
ty this season and every season in the 
future can thank Joe for the experi-
ence. 
May he rest in peace. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1877 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today, 71 days in the fiscal 
year, 71 days into a continuing resolu-
tion. It is unfortunate. I am placing no 
blame. 
It is unfortunate we have not consid-
ered on the floor of the U.S. Senate— 
not 1 of the 12 regular order appropria-
tions bills. The appropriations process 
is completely broken. Quite honestly, 
it has been broken since I arrived here 
in the Senate in 2011. 
I ran for the U.S. Senate primarily 
because I was concerned about the fact 
that we were mortgaging our children’s 
future. Back then, we were $14 trillion 
in debt, and that was extremely con-
cerning to me. Now, 10 years later, 71 
days into the 2021 fiscal year, we are 
$27.4 trillion into debt. That is an in-
crease of $13.4 trillion. It is almost dou-
ble since I have been here in just 10 
years. 
Again, the appropriations process is 
so broken. During that timeframe, we 
had to pass 36 continuing resolutions. 
The debt limit has no power in terms of 
controlling our out-of-control spend-
ing. We either raised or suspended the 
debt limit nine times. 
Unfortunately, 
during 
that 
time, 
that 10 years, we have also—because of 
the broken process here—we have shut 
down the government three times, 
costing our economy, costing our gov-
ernment billions of dollars, and hurting 
real people. 
I come from the State of Wisconsin, 
where, if the legislature can’t get its 
act together and we don’t pass appro-
priations bills and we are at an im-
passe, we don’t shut down the govern-
ment. We don’t even shut down a par-
ticular agency. What we do is we do 
something that is pretty practical, the 
type of commonsense legislation that 
Wisconsinites would embrace. We just 
appropriate. We just fund the agencies 
or the entire State government at the 
previous year’s level. 
Doesn’t that make sense? I think it 
makes all the sense in the world. 
Again, here we are, 71 days into the 
fiscal year, and we haven’t passed an 
appropriations bill. We have to pass, 
within the next 24 hours or so, our 37th 
continuing resolution to kick the can 
another week so we can get our act to-
gether and pass some kind of massive 
omnibus that nobody is going to be 
able to read before they actually vote 
for it. It is a completely broken proc-
ess. 
I recognize that as chairman of 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs, a certain part of this govern-
ment shutdown—this broken process— 
some of these elements weren’t in my 
committee’s jurisdiction. We had a 
number of pieces of legislation; one by 
Senator PORTMAN; one by Senator 
PAUL; one by Senator LANKFORD, who 
had been working on a similar piece of 
legislation from being in the House, to 
end government shutdowns forever. 
As chairman of the committee, I had 
to take a look at these pieces of legis-
lation and decide which one did I want 
to bring up to my committee, pass out 
of my committee, and bring to the 
floor of the Senate. 
I chose Senator LANKFORD’s because 
he had done a lot of hard work with 
Senator MAGGIE HASSAN on a bipar-
tisan bill. Again, it is very simple. It 
didn’t automatically increase spend-
ing, 
didn’t 
automatically 
decrease 
spending. It did exactly what we do in 
Wisconsin. 
If we don’t get our act together, and 
we don’t pass any appropriations bills 
or a single or two appropriations bills, 
we don’t shut down the government. 
We don’t shut down that agency. We 
just appropriate enough funds at last 
year’s level, and we continue until we 
actually do pass an appropriations bill. 
I know the members of the Appro-
priations Committee and have all the 
respect in the world for the chairman 
and the ranking member. I know they 
don’t like CRs, but, again, this will be 
our 37th CR since I have been here for 
10 years. It is broken. 
But just in case they are concerned 
about these CRs, what I can give you is 
Wisconsin’s history in this. Since we 
passed this commonsense reform, real-
ly, the longest CR we ever had in Wis-
consin since we had this anti-govern-
ment shutdown process was just 4 
months in 1971. That is a long time 
ago, and it was only 4 months. We are 
approaching 4 months now. 
Again, this is the 37th CR since I 
took office. We passed out of my com-
mittee—there were only two dissenting 
votes, two ‘‘no’’ votes. Those came

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7402 
December 10, 2020 
from two Senators who just had an al-
ternate version of the End Government 
Shutdowns Act. We passed this out of 
my committee 12 to 2. 
We have been working now for the 
last year trying to find some vehicle to 
add it on as an amendment to end this 
insanity. 
We thought that with the group of us 
here, this would be a good time. It is a 
very simple bill. Again, if you don’t 
pass an appropriations bill or all the 
appropriation bills, you just fund, you 
appropriate at last year’s level. But we 
have a few little disciplines to force 
the Senators in Congress to do their 
job. 
The first discipline is, we don’t allow 
any Federal or campaign moneys to be 
spent on travel, which, basically, forces 
Members of Congress to stay here until 
we do get our act together, until we do 
pass appropriations bills and fund gov-
ernment that is necessary. 
The other thing we do is we only 
allow Congress, each Chamber, to only 
bring up appropriations bills in their 
Chamber. There is an exception, of 
course, for any bill that would have to 
do with an immediate national secu-
rity emergency. That is pretty much 
it. 
In committee, Senator SCOTT had an 
amendment, which I will turn to him 
to have him describe the final dis-
cipline to force Members of Congress to 
do their jobs: pass appropriations bills 
and fund government without shutting 
the government down. 
Senator SCOTT. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
JOHNSON). The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. First, I want 
to thank the chairman for his effort to 
try to figure out how we can stop shut-
ting down the government. 
When I came up here with Senator 
BRAUN 2 years ago, we were in a gov-
ernment shutdown, and nobody wins. It 
doesn’t work for any part of govern-
ment 
when 
government 
gets 
shut 
down. I know, talking to the appropria-
tions chair and ranking member, that 
they are also focused on making sure of 
what we can do to make sure we pass 
budgets, pass our spending bills, and 
not shut down the government. 
I want to fight the way Washington 
has been working. I want to make sure 
it works for all Florida families, not 
just career politicians. 
I have a background in business like 
Chairman JOHNSON does. In the real 
world, if you don’t do your job, you 
don’t get paid. It is really simple. If 
Congress can’t accomplish its most 
basic task—which I believe is passing a 
budget, appropriations bills, in an or-
derly fashion—then why should we get 
paychecks? I think it is pretty simple. 
When you listen to what Chairman 
JOHNSON
just said; that the current 
system in Washington is clearly bro-
ken, there is no—a lot of people care 
about this, but there is no one, ulti-
mately, who has responsibility and 
there are no consequences and it costs 
our system a lot of money. Congress 
doesn’t pass a budget. Instead, they 
just pass temporary measures, and it 
kicks the can down the road. 
The thing that has been surprising to 
me since I got up here is how little of 
the budget we actually review every 
year. It is surprising to me that about 
70 percent of the budget we don’t even 
look at every year. I think all these 
things are unacceptable. Congress can’t 
continue to just get away with not 
doing its basic job and creating a bur-
den. 
We have to do something different. 
That is why I am proud to join my col-
leagues today to pass the Prevent Gov-
ernment Shutdowns Act, which in-
cludes my no budget, no pay proposal. 
Withholding paychecks from Mem-
bers of Congress who fail to pass a 
budget will help prevent government 
shutdowns, which hurt the economy, 
hurt millions of people. 
It is also an important step to pro-
mote fiscal responsibility in the face of 
what Senator JOHNSON said: $27.4 tril-
lion worth of debt. I believe we need to 
pass the No Budget, No Pay Act now to 
show we are serious about getting this 
spending under control and we are seri-
ous about the future of this Nation. 
Members of Congress make signifi-
cantly more than the average Amer-
ican makes. We make $174,000 a year, 
and we are asking them to do the most 
basic function: pass a budget. It is not 
complicated. I think every Member of 
Congress—rich or poor—can agree Con-
gress should pass a budget every year. 
There is absolutely no reason we can’t. 
Anyone who disagrees should not have 
this job. 
Let’s go back. When the American 
people don’t do their job, there are con-
sequences. It is time we make Wash-
ington work a little bit like what the 
real world looks like. Let’s pass the 
Prevent Government Shutdowns Act 
and get the No Budget, No Pay Act 
done. 
I refer to my colleague from Indiana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, Rick 
mentioned that back in 2018, we ran on 
what we are talking about today. We 
wouldn’t be honest to the people who 
elected us to come here. 
I had eight pages of prepared re-
marks. This is something I have talked 
about so often. I am going to cover 
some new terrain to make it relatable 
to the citizens across this country 
about how this place works and how it 
is so different from how anything else 
works. 
A few of us come from the world of 
accountability—the business world— 
where you don’t have the luxury of 
doing what we do here in the Federal 
Government. Listen to this closely be-
cause this is what most citizens don’t 
understand. We are given the revenues 
here in this place, and our only job, No. 
1, should be not to spend more than 
what we are given. We don’t do that. 
We borrow 23 percent, roughly, of 
what we spend. Try taking that to your 
banker, running a business, see if you 
can get a loan doing that. That is just 
a real simple way to look at how we do 
this year after year. 
On Main Street, whether you are run-
ning a business, whether it is your 
household—I served in State govern-
ment for 3 years. We were smart 
enough to have a balanced budget 
amendment. We believed in things like 
a rainy day fund. It was in our DNA. 
We didn’t have to think about it; that 
in the long run, you are not going to 
succeed if you spend more than what 
you take in. 
Coming out of World War II was the 
highest level of national debt we ever 
had—roughly, where we are now. That 
generation, we know what they went 
through. They were savers. They were 
investors and not only in government. 
We are now spenders and consumers. 
You would think that in the biggest 
business in the world—we spend about 
$4.5 trillion a year. We take in maybe 
about $3.5. Of course, in a year like 
this, where you had a pandemic, add 
another $3 trillion or so to the national 
debt. And structurally, we will be 
marching, over the next 5 to 7 years, to 
where that goes to $1.5 trillion a year. 
Start adding all that up. 
Here is what is going to happen. 
When we are in a position like we are 
now, where you can borrow money for 
nearly nothing—we are the only re-
serve currency in the world that allows 
us to do it—that doesn’t mean you 
should do it because we are piling up 
obligations 
on 
our 
kids 
and 
our 
grandkids, and we might as well admit 
it. How have we evolved to get to 
where we are now? I don’t think that is 
as much an issue as we know where we 
are now. It is not sustainable. 
Here is what is going to happen to 
the most important programs we have 
and that everybody likes: Social Secu-
rity, Medicare. Medicare has been 
around since the mid-1960s. All of us 
have been paying into it, employers 
and employees. Every penny will be ex-
hausted out of the trust fund, and that 
was about 5 to 51⁄2 years. Now it has ad-
vanced, due to our current financial 
situation, to maybe 4 or 5. What hap-
pens? This will be the first reality, the 
shock that comes to the American pub-
lic—especially elderly who depend on 
Medicare for their healthcare—18 per-
cent across-the-board cuts. Think of 
the static and the uproar we will hear 
then. 
We can stop it if we just have a little 
discipline. That is mostly about em-
bracing something like I put forward, 
the Fair Care Act, which is the most 
comprehensive, 
aggressive 
with 
healthcare costs in this country. 
As a CEO from Main Street, and 
CEOs across the country, small busi-
ness owners, the biggest problem we 
deal 
with 
is 
the 
high 
cost 
of 
healthcare. Of course, we here protect 
a healthcare industry that is broken. 
And you have another side that wants 
to get more government involved. And, 
really, all it takes there is to have

transparency and competition—have a 
consumer who is engaged in his or her 
own well-being, and you would have 
prices cascade down. 
Those are tough decisions. You take 
on three of the four biggest lobbies in 
the country—pharma, hospitals, and 
insurance. That is another thing that 
doesn’t make this place work. With So-
cial Security, we have some time 
there, but that was crafted back when 
life spans were a lot shorter than what 
they are now. We knew that actuari-
ally, and it has been coming at us for 
years. We have until, maybe, 2032 or 
2033. We have been paying into that 
since the Great Depression, but every 
penny out of the trust fund will be 
gone. I think you get the picture. 
When I came here—as did Senator 
JOHNSON
from 
Wisconsin, 
Senator 
SCOTT from Florida, and a few fiscal 
conservatives, like Senator LEE and a 
few others who will weigh in on this— 
I talked about what was uncomfort-
able. Well, to me, we have had all of 
this time, and we have not done any-
thing about it. We have the perfect op-
portunity. We know we are in this cur-
rent dynamic, and we know we will 
have to get through it, but what we are 
here to do today is to get a vote on a 
simple bill that says, do not shut the 
government down when we are trying 
to get through these issues. 
Put a little bit of rigor and discipline 
into the process with the No Budget, 
No Pay Act, and then, maybe, we can 
get to the point at which we give the 
American public a better product. 
Imagine if everything were given to 
you in terms of your revenues. First of 
all, don’t spend more than what you 
take in. When you have a year to do 
something, start on day one. That is 
the way it works in the real world, and 
that is the way it works in a house-
hold. That is the way it worked on a 
school board on which I served for 10 
years, and that is the way it works in 
a place like Indiana, which balances its 
budget every year, has a rainy day 
fund, and lives responsibly. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, article I, 
section 9, clause 7 of the Constitution 
makes clear that no money will be 
drawn from the Treasury except by an 
appropriation passed by Congress. Arti-
cle I, section 7 of the Constitution like-
wise makes clear that you can’t pass 
an appropriation or any other form of 
legislation without the same docu-
ment, the same bill, the same proposal 
passing the House of Representatives 
and passing the Senate and then being 
submitted to the President for signa-
ture, veto, or acquiescence. 
Over time, particularly in the last 
decade, it has become increasingly 
common for Congress to recognize the 
cumbersome nature of that process, 
which is cumbersome by design. It is 
sometimes easier to just circumvent 
the 
process, 
technically 
complying 
with its commands but doing so in a 
way that doesn’t really invite or even 
allow for individual Members or their 
constituents to know what they are 
voting for when they vote on a spend-
ing bill. This is what we have come to 
refer to as governing by cliff in the 
spending context, and it has, sadly, be-
come the status quo in Washington. It 
often provides Members with a simple 
binary choice when they are facing a 
spending bill. 
When you come up against a spend-
ing cliff, it means a deadline, almost 
always one arbitrarily imposed by the 
previous spending bill. It is when you 
come up close to that and there is no 
spending bill on the floor until, maybe, 
a day or two or sometimes an hour or 
two or sometimes more like a minute 
or two. It is something that has been 
negotiated behind closed doors by only 
a small handful of Members of Con-
gress, excluding everyone else in the 
House, everyone else in the Senate, and 
the hundreds of millions of people they 
collectively represent. 
Sometimes that kind of legislation is 
brought forward—not just sometimes. 
Basically, it is every time. As my 
friend and colleague the Senator from 
Wisconsin noted a minute ago, I think 
this will mark the 37th consecutive 
time that Congress has passed some-
thing like this or it is, at least, the 
37th time that Congress has passed 
something like this since Senator 
JOHNSON and I came to the Senate and 
were sworn into office in 2011. 
The problem with this is that Mem-
bers can’t reasonably know what they 
are voting on in advance, and then 
they are given the simple binary choice 
to take it or leave it. You won’t have 
any opportunity to amend it. You real-
ly won’t even have the opportunity to 
read it or understand it, much less 
communicate its contents to your con-
stituents, who will have to pay for it. 
You can vote for that in its entirety or 
you can vote against it, but if you vote 
against it and it doesn’t pass, you will 
be blamed singlehandedly for shutting 
down the government regardless of 
whether you would have preferred to 
have brought up and, in fact, had tried 
for a long period of time to bring up 
spending bills prior to that last pos-
sible moment. This puts the American 
people and their elected lawmakers in 
the House and the Senate in an unten-
able position, one that I would analo-
gize to a circumstance of an individual 
who lives in an outlying area. 
Let’s suppose that you move to an 
outlying area, one that is distant from 
any other town. Let’s suppose that, on 
your first day of work after moving to 
that town, you are about to leave 
home, and you speak to your signifi-
cant other on the phone, who informs 
you: Bring home bread, milk, and eggs 
when you stop by the store. Make sure 
you get those on your way home. Don’t 
come home without them. 
So you go to this grocery store in 
this outlying area that is distant from 
any other town. It is the only store in 
town. It is the only store, in fact, for 
hours in any direction. You go to the 
store, and you get your cart. You put 
in your bread. You get the milk, and 
you put in the eggs. Then you get to 
the checkout counter. 
The checkout person says: OK. This 
is how much the eggs cost, the bread, 
and the milk, but there is a problem. 
What is the problem? 
Well, you can’t buy just these items. 
Why can’t I buy just these items? 
I am not going to let you buy the 
bread or the milk or the eggs unless 
you also buy a half a ton of iron ore 
and a bucket of nails and a book about 
cowboy poetry. In fact, now that I 
think about it, you are going to have 
to buy one of every item in the store. 
Nobody would want to live that way, 
and nobody would want to shop that 
way. Of course, that is never the way 
we would want to do business in our 
government; yet, in some ways, it kind 
of is because a small handful of people 
put together that shopping list, so to 
speak, and put it together in one bill. 
Those bills are often hundreds and, in 
some cases, thousands of pages long, 
and we usually have no more than a 
few hours to read them before they are 
passed into law. 
That is where this legislation comes 
about. The End Government Shut-
downs Act would force Congress to 
abandon this barbaric, binary form of 
appropriations. Perhaps more impor-
tantly, it would end the threat of the 
shutdown, which is very often the pro-
pellant, the fuel, for perpetuating this 
barbaric form of alienation—this bar-
baric form of the disenfranchisement of 
most of the people represented by most 
Democrats and most Republicans in 
the Senate and in the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Look, I understand that none of this 
is easy, and I have nothing but pro-
found respect and affection for my col-
leagues who are involved in writing 
these bills. That respect and affection 
should cut both ways, and it should 
mean that we have the opportunity to 
vote on spending bills before they hit 
us so that we are not left with this 
awful, untenable, binary choice be-
tween funding everything that a small 
handful of Members has foreordained or 
voting for nothing and being blamed 
for a shutdown. 
We have to end the process of spend-
ing by cliff. This and only this, I be-
lieve, is something that could bring 
certainty to Americans and will allow 
for more time to bring these bills to 
the floor and will allow for the kind of 
transparency that the American people 
need, expect, and deserve but, for the 
last decade or two, have not received. 
Mr. President, I yield my time back 
to my friend and colleague, Senator 
JOHNSON from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. I yield time to Sen-
ator LEAHY. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have 
found so much of what I have heard 
that I can agree with. I certainly agree 
that we ought to be able to pass our an-
nual appropriations bills. I certainly

December 10, 2020 
agree that we should prevent Federal 
Government shutdowns, which waste 
billions upon billions upon billions of 
dollars’ worth of taxpayers’ money, 
plus all of the burdens they put on 
American families, Federal employees, 
and so forth. But I am afraid that my 
good friends on the other side of the 
aisle are letting rhetoric get ahead of 
reality. 
The reality is that the majority in 
the Senate controls the calendar in the 
Senate. All of these appropriations 
bills could have been brought up in 
June or July or September. We could 
have voted on them, piece by piece, up 
and down, and had amendments. Every-
body would have had plenty of time to 
have read every line of them, to have 
amendments to strike things or add 
things they wanted. I mention this be-
cause it can be done. The House of Rep-
resentatives, under Democratic con-
trol—I don’t mean that to be partisan 
but to show the difference—they actu-
ally passed all of their appropriations 
bills and its COVID bill, the so-called 
Heroes Act, in May. 
In the Appropriations Committee, we 
have been working very hard. Senator 
SHELBY’s staff has, and mine has too. 
We have given up a lot of time with my 
colleagues—and for all good reasons. 
Many of us stayed here working on 
those 
appropriations 
bills, 
but 
we 
couldn’t bring the bills up. 
Now, the Republican leader, the ma-
jority leader, could have brought up 
any one of these bills at any time he 
had wanted. We could have done it, al-
lowing a 1-hour time agreement for 
amendments. After all, the Repub-
licans in the majority have nothing to 
fear about that. If they don’t like an 
amendment, they can vote it down. 
This would give the Senator from Utah 
and everybody else a chance to read 
each one of these bills. If they don’t 
like it, bring up an amendment to 
strike it. That could have been done; it 
was not. 
One of the reasons it was not done 
was because we had to take up Senate 
time, day after day after day, to put 
through nominees—mostly backed by 
special interest groups—on the Federal 
bench and elsewhere. We had to vote on 
those. Why? We can vote on those, but 
also take the time to vote on these 
things. Bring up the appropriations 
bills, and vote on them one by one. 
Amend them if you want; vote them 
down if you want. 
I say to my friends on the other side 
of the aisle, You have the majority. 
You can vote them all down or vote 
them all up. But what happens when 
you enact an automatic CR, which I 
would oppose, it means you don’t work 
out the parts of full-year appropria-
tions bills. There would be no incentive 
for Members to negotiate full-year ap-
propriations bills. We were not elected 
to put the government on autopilot. 
We were elected to make careful 
choices. 
I would argue the reason we are here 
is that people were afraid to actually 
stand up and vote up or down on appro-
priations bills earlier this year when 
they had the chance. It is easy to say: 
Golly gee, let’s have an automatic con-
tinuing resolution. Sounds good. What 
it says is that we can take all of our 
weekends off. We can have the govern-
ment fly us home. We can pay for all of 
these things, but we don’t do our work. 
What I am saying is we should have 
stayed here over a few weekends. I 
would say to my friends on the other 
side of the aisle, the Republican side, 
allow the bills to come up one by one 
and vote them up or down. If you don’t 
like parts of it, vote to take it out. 
Vote it up or down. Again, you have 
the majority, if you don’t like what is 
in there. Full-year appropriations bills 
give Congress the opportunity to ad-
dress the needs of today rather than 
continue the priorities of the past. 
I have been here long enough to know 
that things that looked great 2 or 3 
years ago are not the priorities today 
because 
things 
change. 
Certainly, 
under COVID, we have seen, in many 
ways, a 15-year change in society, edu-
cation, business, industries, and more 
in 15 weeks. 
So each year in the annual appropria-
tions bills, Congress adjusts spending 
levels to deal with emerging issues fac-
ing the American people. We can elimi-
nate funding for projects that have 
been completed or no longer needed. 
We can direct funding to higher pri-
ority programs. It is detailed, exacting 
work. It is nice to talk in slogans and 
generalities, but I invite those Sen-
ators to sit down and go through, day 
by day, the kind of work the Senators 
and the superb staff, both Republican 
and Democratic, do in putting together 
this legislation. It is detailed, exacting 
work, but it is what the American peo-
ple expect. That is what we all thought 
was a smart decision about how to in-
vest their hard-earned tax dollars. 
If you operate under an automatic 
CR, none of these adjustments can be 
made. Automatic CRs lock in the sta-
tus quo, and we can say: Bye-bye. We 
are heading home for the holidays. Oh, 
an emergency in COVID came up? Well, 
it is not in the automatic CR, so tough. 
We didn’t have time to do anything 
about it. Oh, there is flooding in Flor-
ida or Nebraska or fires in the West or 
anything else. Well, the automatic CR 
didn’t cover it because we didn’t have 
money for it a year before. 
No, that is not the way to do it. The 
Congress and the White House have a 
responsibility to work together to 
enact funding bills to keep the govern-
ment open. Automatic CRs might save 
face and time and allow us to do other 
things that we might like to do back 
home, but in doing so, they relieve us 
of our obligations to the Constitution 
and to the American taxpayer. We 
shouldn’t be relieved of these obliga-
tions. 
I know the last time we had a gov-
ernment shutdown, it was over a bill 
where the President felt that it didn’t 
give him enough for a wall along the 
border between the United States and 
Mexico, a wall that is being built at 
great expense and accomplishing very 
little. That is why it was stopped. 
So for a month and a half, we sat 
there, parts of the government closed 
down, our States, our people, our Fed-
eral Government losing billions upon 
billions upon billions of dollars. You 
know how that finally got reopened? 
We started off a series of meetings on a 
Monday. The House was in session; the 
Senate was in session. It was a good 
time to begin. We began in Senator 
SHELBY’s office, and we continued it in 
my office here in the Capitol. 
We had two the chair and ranking 
member of the House Appropriations 
Committee. We had two Senators: my 
good friend—and he is a good and close 
friend—DICK SHELBY, the chairman of 
the Appropriations Committee, and 
myself as the vice chairman. And the 
four of us sat there for 3 or 4 hours. We 
talked about everything from photog-
raphy to travel and then went in line 
by line of the bills, and we came to an 
agreement. And we were able to ex-
plain our agreement to the House and 
the Senate, and it was voted through, 
and the government reopened. 
Incidentally, the President praised it. 
He said that he had gone through it, 
and it was so good. And I thank him for 
doing that because it gave him a lot 
less money for the wall than the bill 
that he vetoed had given him. 
But the government reopened. 
I mention this because it seems that 
those billions of dollars were spent 
more as a political stunt than some-
thing that benefits hard-earned tax-
payer dollars. 
So instead of rhetoric that ignores 
reality, let’s get to the reality. Let’s 
pledge—whoever is in the majority in 
the end—we will bring up each of the 
appropriations bills, vote them up or 
down or amend them. We could have 
done this in June or July. If we had 
done that, we wouldn’t be where we are 
now. It was a missed opportunity. 
If we say let’s have an automatic CR 
no matter what happens, whether we 
have earthquakes, floods, fires, COVID, 
attacks on the United States, anything 
else, we can just sit back and relax, not 
have to do all of the weekends and holi-
days and late-night work that many of 
us in both parties do on appropriations 
because we have got an automatic CR. 
When I came to the Senate, both the 
Republican and Democratic leaders 
told me—and I was the most junior 
Member of the Senate at the time— 
that we should be the conscience of the 
Nation. It meant doing your work. 
I never expected to be the dean of the 
Senate, but I have seen both Repub-
licans and Democrats do that work. At 
times, it has been into late Friday 
night or early Saturday morning, but 
we have done it and passed it. 
Where did those days go? Where did 
those days go? 
So when Senator SHELBY
became 
chair and I became vice chair, we 
passed a series of appropriations bills.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7405 
December 10, 2020 
And I think we got 80, 90, 95, and some-
times 100 Senators to vote for those 
bills. We usually can’t get a vote with 
that many to say the Sun rises in the 
East. The majority gave us time to 
bring those votes up, debate them, and 
vote them up or down. 
I will have more comments to make. 
I don’t question the good intentions of 
any Senator here, but what I am saying 
is, we could have done this in June; we 
could have done it in July; we could 
have done it in August; we could have 
done it in September; we could have 
done it in November. And to now com-
plain—well, up to the last few days, we 
have got to change everything. Instead, 
let’s pledge that we will follow regular 
order in the coming days. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate the comments of the Senator 
from Vermont. 
I think what Senator LEE and I were 
talking about is, you know, as opposed 
to the way it used to be, when we got 
here in 2011, the appropriations process 
was completely broken, and it is still 
broken. And it has been a bipartisan 
failure. 
I arrived in 2011 under Democratic 
leadership. Now we are in a Republican 
leadership. It is broken. 
The good news is the Preventing Gov-
ernment Shutdown Act is a bipartisan 
solution. It passed 12-to-2 out of my 
committee. It is cosponsored, largely, 
by Senator LANKFORD
and Senator 
HASSAN. 
The concerns that the Senator from 
Vermont expressed about an automatic 
CR and passage of this bill is addressed 
in the bill. The bill has the disciplines 
to force us to only work on appropria-
tions bills. We can leave town but not 
on the Federal dime, not on campaign 
money. We will have to pay for that 
ourselves. 
And I don’t know what we are going 
to pay for it with because we are not 
going to get paid until we actually pass 
the appropriations bill. So the dis-
cipline is already set in here. That is 
what is so beautiful about this bill, 
what is so elegant about it. 
As I said, in Wisconsin, once they en-
forced this discipline, the most we have 
ever had is a 4-month CR. We are 71 
days into this CR, and we are going to 
pass it for another week. 
This process is broken. The Pre-
venting Government Shutdown Act is a 
solution that will force us back to the 
good old days, where we bring up the 
appropriations bills, because my guess 
is that not many Members of Congress 
aren’t going to want to not get paid 
and not be able to go back to their dis-
trict. 
So it will focus our minds. We will 
only be able to work on appropriations 
bills, other than in a national emer-
gency. We will get the job done. That is 
what happened in Wisconsin. This is a 
solution. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of Calendar No. 
304, S. 1877. I ask that the committee- 
reported 
substitute 
amendment 
be 
withdrawn, 
the 
Braun 
substitute 
amendment at the desk be considered 
agreed to, and the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Reserving the right to 
object. 
My colleagues, I believe here today, 
are promoting legislation that they 
claim will spur Congress to pass appro-
priations bills in the event of a govern-
ment shutdown—in other words, to 
avoid it. 
I think they have a good idea, but 
would that do the job? I doubt it, but 
this debate will go on, and it should be-
cause I agree with the frustration that 
so many of you have, including the 
Presiding Officer here. We are having 
to part with it. 
My colleague from Vermont, Senator 
LEAHY, and I, for 2 straight years, with 
cooperation—bipartisanship—were able 
basically to pass these appropriations 
bills, most of them, for the first time 
in years. This has slowed down this 
year, absolutely. I know it is a big 
Presidential race and everybody run-
ning this year and that throws it into 
it. 
But we would like to pass these bills 
before October 1, just as you would. 
But I don’t believe this legislation 
would do what you think it would do, 
and I think it deserves further inquiry 
and scrutiny. 
I believe it would exacerbate, in some 
ways, the problem that we are trying 
to resolve here. We are right now close 
to closing out, hopefully, all of our ap-
propriations bills. We call it an omni-
bus. I agree with their frustration. We 
should, as a body, both parties, every 
Member of the Senate, should have had 
the priority, No. 1, to do this before Oc-
tober 1 each year, as we used to do it. 
So unless this legislation somehow 
prohibits political partisanship, I don’t 
believe it will increase the probability 
that we get our work done, shutdown 
or not. 
I think the key is to work together. 
Senator 
LEAHY
and 
I 
have 
dem-
onstrated that in a few years, but we 
need all of us to come together on this 
and place the rules first, place the gov-
ernment—don’t shut down. 
I stand before you every day. The 
worst thing we can do is shut down the 
government. The specter of a shutdown 
is bad in itself, which we face right 
today. 
So I believe the most important in-
centive right now for us to do is try to 
work together. If we can’t, we are 
going to have to do something. It 
might be something like what you are 
talking about, but I think it deserves 
further debate, further inquiry. 
And there is a political downside to 
all this, I know. But if we work to-
gether, we will get these bills passed. 
Nobody is more acutely aware of that 
than my colleague from Vermont, who 
has been on the Appropriations Com-
mittee for many years, before I was 
even there. But the American people, 
as someone said here today, elected us 
to do our job. They are absolutely 
right—we should do our job and do it 
promptly, and we can if we work to-
gether. 
Having said that, I know this issue is 
not going away unless we do our job 
like we should, but I object to the 
unanimous consent request at this 
point. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. 
JOHNSON. 
I 
appreciate 
the 
words from the Senators from Vermont 
and Alabama. I would like to work 
with you, and I think all of us would 
like to work with you on a solution to 
this problem. So I appreciate those 
words, and I look forward to working 
with you in the future on this. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have pro-
found respect and admiration for both 
the Senator from Alabama and the 
Senator from Vermont. As you can tell 
from their remarks, they are conge-
nial, collegial, and delightful people. 
They also have many decades of legis-
lative experience between the two of 
them, and the country has been blessed 
by their gifts, their talents, and their 
willingness to work hard. 
I want to respond to a couple of 
points made a moment ago, one sug-
gesting, perhaps, that the answer to all 
of this is simply a desire to work to-
gether, as if that were somehow not 
what we have in mind. 
We were also told a moment ago that 
they are almost finished with the ap-
propriations process, that it is almost 
complete. Now, if that is the case, then 
I would ask the question, why haven’t 
we been permitted to see it? Why 
haven’t the other Members of the U.S. 
Senate been able to see that? It is a lit-
tle bit hard for some of us to hear that 
if we all work together, we can get this 
done, when that is literally all we are 
asking. 
I don’t think any one of us sup-
porting Senator JOHNSON’s legislation 
is here saying that it is perfect or here 
saying that it would magically solve 
every problem in the world or even 
every problem in the U.S. Senate hav-
ing to do with the spending process. We 
are not saying that. But what we are 
saying is that without it, we will stay 
stuck in the same closed-loop system. 
So to suggest that there is somehow 
a lack of desire on our part or on the 
part of anyone who is not an appropri-
ator or anyone who is not the chairman 
and ranking member of the Appropria-
tions Committee, that this is somehow 
a product of a lack of desire and will-
ingness to work together, that is not 
fair. That is not accurate. That is quite

S7406 
December 10, 2020 
the opposite of the truth. What we are 
asking for is a seat at the table. 
Article V of the Constitution out-
lines the procedure for amending the 
Constitution, for making changes to 
the structure of government that we 
have, what it may and may not do. Ar-
ticle VI of the Constitution preemp-
tively disposes of any proposed con-
stitutional 
amendment 
that 
would 
alter the principle of equal representa-
tion in the Senate. It is the one rule 
that cannot be changed. It is so funda-
mental to our system of government, 
to this system of government that has 
helped foster the development of the 
greatest civilization the world has ever 
known, that in this Chamber, every 
State has to be represented equally. 
That doesn’t happen and, indeed, it 
can’t happen when you have some of 
the most significant measures that will 
ever come before this body com-
mandeered by one committee, the 
Committee on Appropriations. 
Now, granted, as has been suggested 
in the last couple of speeches we have 
heard, we have some great talent 
among our members on the Appropria-
tions Committee. We have great talent 
among the staffers on the Appropria-
tions Committee. They work really 
hard. They are really smart. They are 
really determined, and they are highly 
specialized. That isn’t the problem. 
The problem is that in most cir-
cumstances, because of the way we 
bring things up, most of us are com-
pletely disenfranchised from the proc-
ess. 
This doesn’t mean that it is the fault 
of the Appropriations Committee. I 
don’t believe that it is. It is, instead, a 
fault of the way in which we schedule 
votes and the fact that these things 
aren’t brought up until the last pos-
sible minute, and then we are given 
this awful choice of, vote for a whole 
bunch of things that you don’t nec-
essarily support and can’t even com-
pletely know about or vote against it 
and be blamed for a government shut-
down. 
That is all this bill is trying to do, is 
to get us out of that toxic loop—a loop 
that is the opposite of collegial, the op-
posite of respectful, and that is utterly 
incompatible with the principle of 
equal representation in the Senate—a 
principle that cannot be undone even 
by a constitutional amendment. 
Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 
Mr. LEE. Yes, I will. 
Mr. LEAHY. Should we be able to 
represent our constituents? Of course. 
He and I agree, and he and I have 
agreed on a lot of different things, es-
pecially constitutional issues, in this 
body. And I share his concern of sud-
denly being handed a piece of legisla-
tion like this, and we are going to vote 
on it in 10 minutes or an hour or so. 
Would he agree with me that if the 
leader said that Tuesday of next 
week—say this was done earlier in the 
year—Tuesday of next week, we will 
bring up this part of the appropriations 
bill from the committee, the com-
mittee having voted on it, Republicans 
and Democrats—I think it is close to a 
third of the U.S. Senate that is on that 
committee—having voted on it, and it 
will be open to amendments. Then 
after we finish that one, we will bring 
up the next one. 
Would that cover many of the prob-
lems that the Senator from Utah has? 
Mr. LEE. In response to the question, 
the answer is yes. Absolutely yes. That 
is exactly what we want. That is ex-
actly what we deserve. And this is one 
of many manifestations of the fact that 
my friend, my distinguished colleague, 
the senior Senator from Vermont, has 
the benefit of many decades of experi-
ence in this body. He has been here at 
times when the Senate has functioned 
precisely like that, as it should. That 
is exactly what we want. That is how 
the Senate is supposed to function, and 
that is how it has functioned for most 
of the existence of our great Republic. 
So that in and of itself would not 
only help address the problem, it would 
be the solution to the problem. That is 
why I insist this is not a problem that 
can be fairly laid at the feet of the in-
dividual members of the Appropria-
tions Committee or even necessarily 
the chairman and ranking member of 
the Appropriations Committee. It is a 
problem with the way we schedule 
votes, and it is also a problem related 
to the first, with a lack of willingness 
to allow amendments to be brought. 
The filibuster is itself maligned and 
often misunderstood, but the purpose 
of a filibuster from the very origins of 
this institution was to allow for theo-
retically unlimited debate, discussion, 
and opportunities for amendments to 
legislation. Nowhere would that be 
more important than in the case of 
where we are spending the public’s 
money. That is what we are supposed 
to be doing. That is how it always did 
work in the past. The very reason why 
we have the filibuster rule to begin 
with is to allow for, to facilitate, to en-
courage unlimited debate, discussion, 
and amendments. 
So, 
yes, 
I 
wish 
this 
legislation 
weren’t necessary, but it is with pre-
cisely that objective in mind that we 
push this legislation. Why? Well, some 
of us have been here for many years, 
and in the case of Senator JOHNSON and 
myself, we have been here now for a 
decade. We have hoped for that exact 
type of scenario that Senator LEAHY 
just described to come about, and I 
don’t doubt Senator LEAHY’s sincerity 
one bit in raising that point. That is 
exactly what we need. 
The incentives aren’t there. The in-
centives on the part of those making 
these decisions to bring these things up 
with too little time for debate, amend-
ment, or even reading the bill and dis-
cussing it with our constituents—those 
making that decision have forestalled 
the kind of debate and discussion that 
needs to occur. The incentive structure 
is such that those making that very de-
cision are not going to want to relin-
quish that immense power, particu-
larly if they can be a part of and even 
control what goes into that bill, who 
knows about it when, and then vir-
tually guarantee passage on the Senate 
floor. 
Something has to change in order to 
alter that incentive structure to bring 
about exactly the kind of dynamic Sen-
ator LEAHY has described. Look, we can 
do this. It is not that hard. But we are 
going to have to adopt some changes to 
our procedures, and ultimately we owe 
it to our constituents not to bend un-
flinchingly and reflexively every single 
time somebody brings forward a spend-
ing bill at the very last minute. 
I remember one of many moments in 
which this has occurred arose in March 
of 2018. We had been anticipating for 
many months a spending bill. We had a 
lot of conversations among and be-
tween Members about the need to de-
bate, discuss, and amend spending leg-
islation before it was brought to the 
floor. We had been assured that we 
would have more of an opportunity 
than we had in previous Congresses. 
Then one Wednesday evening in 
March of 2018, we received an email. 
The email arrived at I believe about 
8:30 or 8:45 in the evening. It told us 
that attached is a copy of a spending 
bill. We will be voting on this some-
time in the Senate. We weren’t told 
when. I opened the attachment. The at-
tachment contained a 2,232-page spend-
ing bill spending well over $1 trillion. 
We immediately started reviewing 
that. I divided up that legislation by 
section among my staff and then spent 
the entire night and the entire fol-
lowing day reviewing that legislation. 
We got a basic understanding of what 
it did but only rudimentary. A 2,232- 
page omnibus spending bill does not ex-
actly read like a fast-paced novel. 
To my great astonishment, before we 
were even finished reading that bill, 
much less before we had the oppor-
tunity to even conceive of or draft 
amendments, much less propose them, 
the House of Representatives passed 
that bill without amendment before 
lunch the next day. The Senate passed 
the same legislation about 12 or 13 
hours later. 
This process has repeated itself over 
and over again. We can’t fool ourselves 
into believing that it is going to 
change without some alteration to pro-
cedure and to the set of incentives that 
perpetuate that vicious cycle—one that 
is no respecter of persons, no respecter 
of Republicans versus Democrats, lib-
erals versus conservatives, or even Sen-
ators versus Representatives. It is just 
a fundamentally anti-American and 
undemocratic way of doing things. We 
can do better, and we must.

FOREIGN POLICY 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to 
talk today for a few minutes about 
something that I don’t think has got-
ten the attention it deserves, and that 
is the many successes in foreign policy 
over the last 4 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7407 
December 10, 2020 
I think at the top of my list of for-
eign policy successes in terms of unan-
ticipated accomplishments that we 
would not have thought would happen 
would be the Abraham accords that 
were signed at the White House in Sep-
tember. This agreement paves the way 
for normalized relations between Israel 
and the United Arab Emirates and 
Israel and Bahrain and I believe really 
establishes a way where the rest of the 
Middle East could hopefully follow this 
step in the right direction. I think not 
only is this one of the most significant 
moves in decades to promote peace and 
understanding in the Middle East, but, 
frankly, it probably wouldn’t have hap-
pened if we hadn’t had a President who 
hadn’t spent years hearing how some-
thing like this was impossible. The 
President believed it was possible, and 
it was because of his strong leadership 
that the countries involved made it a 
priority to bridge the gap that every-
one thought was unbridgeable, that 
really had separated these neighbors 
for generations. 
What we see when we look at this 
and other events in recent times is 
that when our friends become friends 
with each other, we win. The United 
States wins when our friends also be-
come friends with each other. 
This agreement can be a model for 
future progress in the region. It is the 
first time in four decades that any 
Arab country has recognized Israel, 
and you can see it is already making a 
difference. We had debate on the floor 
yesterday about our continued partner-
ship—our 
defense 
partnership—with 
the United Arab Emirates, and this 
was, obviously, an element in that de-
bate. That partnership, over three dif-
ferent administrations, produced some-
thing that nobody would have antici-
pated in any of the earlier decades. 
The President started his Middle 
East efforts by acknowledging Jeru-
salem as the capital of Israel in his 
first year in office. A few months later, 
he moved the U.S. Embassy there. 
Now, was this a new idea? Absolutely 
not a new idea. American Presidents 
have been saying for years that this 
was a good idea. Party platforms have 
said for years that Israel should be able 
to have their capital in Jerusalem ac-
knowledged, but nobody had done it be-
fore. Congress had said repeatedly this 
should happen, but it hadn’t happened 
and didn’t happen until the Trump ad-
ministration decided to make it hap-
pen. 
Critics actually said that moving our 
embassy would hurt our credibility in 
the region, and, 3 years later, the Abra-
ham accords proved that that was 100 
percent wrong. 
Another reason American credibility 
has soared in the Middle East is that 
President Trump took a strong stance 
against Iran. He did that by dealing 
with the nuclear agreement that Presi-
dent Obama and the Obama adminis-
tration had struck with Iran as a bad 
idea. It was an idea that actually al-
lowed Iran to eventually get a nuclear 
weapon and reduced sanctions on the 
country’s leaders as they continued to 
sponsor terrorism around the world. In 
fact, he even returned substantial 
amounts of money that we now know 
went, in large part, into terror-building 
network efforts. 
The agreement was badly handled 
from the start. It didn’t work after we 
entered into it. We didn’t enter into it 
in any kind of binding way because it 
was clear, at the time, that if this 
agreement would have been presented 
as a treaty, it had no chance of being 
approved by the Senate. 
So it was entered into, thinking: This 
is such a great idea that the next 
President will just have to do it, 
whether the country is bound to it or 
not. 
The hard work of doing our work the 
right way makes a difference, and, in 
fact, that agreement would have been 
changed before a Senate would have 
considered ever approving it. But it 
would have been either approved or not 
approved rather than the process we 
went through, which was a lot of Sen-
ate opposition but no response to that 
opposition. 
President Trump put a spotlight on 
the deal’s failure to protect our na-
tional security. He took a strong new 
approach to applying maximum pres-
sure on the Iranian regime, and it has 
had impact. Eventually, that new view 
led to eliminating Qasem Soleimani, 
who was clearly the architect of Iran’s 
terrorist activities and the attacks on 
Americans. There has been no doubt 
about that for a long time. Iran was 
the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism. 
General Soleimani was the No. 1 archi-
tect of that state sponsorship of ter-
rorism, and the President was willing 
to do what needed to be done there. 
The world is a safer place with him 
gone. Iran knows that we will not turn 
a blind eye on aggression or on false 
promises or, often, even on things 
being said that, on the face of them, 
are clearly not true and the world com-
munity is expected to agree with them, 
and, frankly, in the case of Iran, often 
decides that the best course is to agree 
to the things that you know are not 
true which are presented as if they are 
true and accepted as if they are true. 
This doesn’t get you where you want. 
Accommodating or rewarding our en-
emies doesn’t advance peace in the 
Middle East or anywhere else. Sup-
porting our allies and building stronger 
alliances and holding terrorists ac-
countable does. 
Stronger alliances are also a goal of 
the Trump administration’s new focus 
on the Indo-Pacific region. The Presi-
dent recognized that China is the 
greatest threat to democracy and free-
dom in the world. He understands that 
America cannot counter that threat 
alone, and because of that, has reached 
out in meaningful ways. While other 
administrations have said they would 
pivot to the Pacific, the Trump admin-
istration actually oversaw a period of 
renewed engagement in the area and 
renewed branding of the area that indi-
cated that the Indo-Pacific is now that 
command and the Indo-Pacific is now 
that focus. We have strengthened our 
alliances with India and with Australia 
and other countries in the region. We 
began working to foster a multilateral 
community—one that will protect the 
free and open nature of the region from 
the threat of China. 
I was just reading in the news today 
that China clearly is sending a message 
in Hong Kong: If you don’t want to be 
in jail and you are for Hong Kong free-
dom, you just need to leave right now. 
And, apparently, they are willing to 
help you get to where your thoughts 
don’t impact others who are willing to 
live under—and, maybe, have no choice 
but to live under—the repression of 
China. 
The President also took action to 
strengthen global security and sta-
bility by asking our allies to pull their 
weight. For too many years, other 
countries seemed content to let Amer-
ican taxpayers bear the cost of defend-
ing freedom everywhere in the world. 
President Trump challenged the other 
members of NATO to meet the organi-
zation’s guideline of spending 2 percent 
of their gross domestic product on de-
fense. Our allies stepped up in many 
cases and did better than they had been 
doing. 
In 2016, just 4 of the 28 countries in 
NATO met the 2 percent guideline—4 
out of 28. Today, that number is still 
not at 28, but it is at 10 countries that 
now exceed the guideline. Remember, 
four countries met the guideline 3 
years and 10 months ago. Ten countries 
have now exceeded the guideline, and 
every country in the alliance with a 
military has increased its defense 
spending. 
That is important progress, and it 
wouldn’t have happened if the Presi-
dent of the United States had not been 
willing to say the obvious, and, frank-
ly, be very direct about it and make 
himself an uncomfortable partner at 
the negotiating table. But if what you 
are uncomfortable about is that you 
are willing to say, ‘‘Do what you have 
agreed to do,’’ it is about time some-
body not only said, ‘‘Do what you have 
agreed to do,’’ but said it in a way that 
other countries took it seriously. 
The President sought to address im-
balances and protect U.S. interests in 
the area of global trade. The Trump ad-
ministration 
replaced 
the 
NAFTA 
agreement with a new trade deal with 
Mexico and Canada. NAFTA was great 
for all three countries, but it needed to 
be improved. It needed to be updated, 
and now it has been. 
In my State, Missouri, those two 
countries are our two biggest trading 
partners, and that is the case for the 
United States. Mexico and then Canada 
dwarf trade with almost every other 
country in the world as they trade with 
the United States, and the new agree-
ment will lead to more jobs and bigger 
paychecks in all three countries. Our 
goal in our neighborhood should be not

just to make ourselves stronger but to 
make our neighbors stronger, because 
we are stronger when our neighbors are 
stronger. 
Nationwide, exports are expected to 
grow by $2.2 billion under the USMCA. 
And our trade relationship with Japan, 
the world’s third largest economy, is 
even stronger, thanks to a new agree-
ment that went into effect at the start 
of the year. 
So it is clear that there has been lots 
of activity in America’s foreign policy 
over the past 4 years. There has been a 
lot of important progress and a lot of 
success stories, and an awful lot of it 
was done in a very unconventional 
way. So, frankly, it just doesn’t get 
covered by the traditional trade press 
or the traditional foreign policy press 
or the traditional defense press in ways 
that really the results should produce. 
These are not areas that get the at-
tention that they deserve. I think, 
when people look back at the 4 years 
that we have just completed in foreign 
policy, they are going to look at what 
has happened, understand it in the con-
text of what was happening, and I am 
sure they will believe that these items 
I talked about today led to a stronger 
and safer country as we approach the 
years ahead of us. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BLUNT). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that after the re-
marks of the next speaker, I may be 
recognized for such time as I may con-
sume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Utah. 
TRIBUTE TO ROB BISHOP 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to celebrate the career of a re-
markable public servant whose accom-
plishments have left an indelible mark 
upon our State and upon our country. 
Congressman ROB BISHOP has earned 
his place among the greats in Utah’s 
political history, and we thank him for 
his service. 
ROB has dedicated his political career 
to fighting the tough battles over 
issues that matter to the people of my 
State, from the virtue of federalism, 
States’ rights, and protecting indi-
vidual liberty, to promoting a strong 
national defense and sound public lands 
policy. And fight he did. 
Four years ago, Puerto Rico was fast 
approaching a fiscal cliff when ROB, as 
chairman of the House Natural Re-
sources Committee, led a successful, 
bipartisan effort to pass a complicated 
rescue package to restructure Puerto 
Rico’s debt before it was too late. 
While ROB will never rush to take 
credit or seek the spotlight, his legisla-
tive achievements are enduring and de-
serve our full praise and recognition. 
His accomplishments manifest closer 
to home as well. The brave men and 
women of our military and civilian 
workforce at Hill Air Force Base know 
ROB as a tremendous advocate and a 
devoted friend. Through the War on 
Terror, improvements and changes in 
aircraft, and updates to our nuclear ar-
senal, ROB has defended our Hill Air 
Force Base valiantly. At Dugway Prov-
ing Ground in Tooele, his commitment 
delivered the completion of an emer-
gency aircraft runway. 
ROB’s impressive efforts and steady 
leadership have raised Utah’s profile 
for our national defense. So, too, has 
his advocacy for the Utah Test and 
Training Range, so it makes sense that 
this key to our Nation’s military readi-
ness should bear his name. Next Con-
gress, I intend to introduce a bill to re-
name it the ‘‘Bishop Utah Test and 
Training Range.’’ 
Rare is a man with such professional 
distinction, intellect, and personal con-
viction for the well-being of family, 
neighbors, and strangers alike, who 
carries himself with such humility as 
ROB. If you have had the pleasure of 
being with ROB at a gathering, you 
know where to find him at the end of 
the night—staying behind to help gath-
er the chairs. 
Most of all, ROB is a teacher. From 
his time as a public school teacher to 
his career in public service, one of his 
highest priorities has been ensuring 
that the next generation of young lead-
ers has access to educational opportu-
nities, not only by securing revenue for 
public school as an elected official but 
also by devoting his time to host stu-
dents in the Capitol to teach them 
about politics, policy, and our govern-
ment. 
It is an honor to recognize my friend 
ROB BISHOP as he begins his next chap-
ter with his wife Jeralynn and their 
five children and nine grandchildren. 
For anyone who has not had the great 
pleasure of meeting ROB, you will like-
ly easily recognize him on the street as 
maybe the last man in Washington who 
wears an impeccable three-piece suit. 
Thank you, ROB, and good luck. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
WESTERN SAHARA 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have 
already asked unanimous consent that 
I be recognized for such time as I may 
consume. 
This is what I want to do. Something 
happened today that is deeply trou-
bling to me, and I have a written re-
sponse to what happened today. I am 
going to go ahead and read that writ-
ten response. Then, I want to talk 
about it. 
My written response is—and I will 
take it so everybody will have the ben-
efit of this. I am talking about people 
here in this country, people in Africa, 
people all around the world who are in-
terested in this issue. 
OK, this is the written response: 
I think that all countries should recognize 
Israel, and applaud the president’s unprece-
dented efforts to foster recognition between 
Israel and Arab nations through the Abra-
ham Accords. 
Today’s White House announcement alleg-
ing Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sa-
hara is shocking and deeply disappointing. I 
am saddened that the rights of the Western 
Saharan people have been traded away. 
In 
1966, 
as 
West 
Africa 
was 
being 
decolonized, 
the 
UN 
General 
Assembly 
agreed— 
This is 1966—agreed the Sahara de-
serves a referendum of self-determina-
tion for its own future. 
The United States has supported this policy 
for decades and has worked to accomplish a 
referendum 
of 
self-determination. 
Until 
today, this Administration had continued 
our long history, one that has remained con-
sistent across administrations— 
Democrat and Republican— 
We’re not alone in this position: the African 
Union, the United Nations, the International 
Court of Justice and the European Union 
have all agreed—the Sahrawi people have the 
right to decide [what] their own future [is 
going to be]. 
The president has been poorly advised by 
his team; he could have made this deal with-
out trading [away] the rights of a voiceless 
people. 
During my most recent visit to the 
Sahrawi refugee camps, I visited with the 
children that live there. They were joyous, 
happy, ordinary children who didn’t know 
yet that they were part of a frozen, forgotten 
conflict where their hopes and freedoms were 
dying a cruel death. 
I’m thinking about them and all the 
Sahrawians today. I won’t stop fighting for 
them. I won’t let the world forget them. 
Today’s announcement does not change 
the United Nations or the EU positions, nor 
the charter of the African Union nor the 
opinion of the [International Court of Jus-
tice]—a referendum must still happen. 
I urge these organizations to stand strong 
to support Western Sahara’s right to self-de-
termination and am confident the [United 
States] will be able to return to the policy 
we’ve held since 1966. 
Let me tell you what this is all 
about. During the colonization period 
in Africa, when different countries had 
colonies there, Spain had the colony of 
the land that is in question today. It 
was called the Spanish Sahara area at 
that time. 
Now, if you remember your history, 
Franco was President at that time, and 
this was back when things were falling 
apart for Spain. Franco was losing a 
lot of the control, and they were not in 
a position to hold onto their colonies— 
not just in Africa but anyplace else in 
the world. 
So at that time, the U.N. came in, in 
1966. This goes all the way back to 1966. 
The U.N. asked for a referendum for 
self-determination for those people. So 
they recognized all the way back—that 
is, the United Nations recognized—the 
sovereignty of the Western Saharan 
people. That has been consistent since 
then. 
That was 1966. Now, in 1975, when 
there were a lot of people kind of lining 
up to see who could get control, Mo-
rocco jumped in with all of their re-
sources and did all they could at that

December 10, 2020 
time to capture that area and to absorb 
that within Morocco—in other words, 
to take away from the free people of 
Western Sahara their land. And they 
did that. 
So the International Court of Justice 
went on to say: Well, if the United Na-
tions couldn’t do it, let’s at least give 
them the right for a referendum for 
self-determination. That was 1975. Im-
mediately after that, Morocco invaded 
Western Sahara. 
Now, you have to keep in mind that 
this is Morocco, with all of the re-
sources and all the wealth that they 
had, taking on a country that was 
armed with crude instruments. These 
are the people who rightfully owned 
and have lived in Western Sahara. 
Western Sahara, if you look—if I had 
time, if I had known about this, I 
would have brought the charts down to 
show where this land was and where it 
is today. 
But, in 1975, the International Court 
of Justice made it very clear that they 
had the right to the territory—that 
Morocco had no right to the territory 
of Western Sahara. Now, they invaded 
Western Sahara. Spain and France 
were complicit at that time. Spain had 
already 
colonized 
that 
area, 
and 
France had desires to do that. 
But 
today—today, 
as 
we 
speak 
today—there is not a country out there 
that recognizes the right of Morocco 
over 
Western 
Sahara—until 
today, 
when this statement came out that we 
are trying to recognize those rights. 
Nobody—now, I am talking about 
what I have already listed, all of the 
people: the African Union, the United 
Nations, the International Court of 
Justice, the European Union—all of 
them—they recognize Sahrawi as the 
people who have the right to decide 
their own future. Everyone is in agree-
ment. 
I can remember talking, at one time, 
to Netanyahu over in Israel and ex-
plaining to them why Morocco should 
not be able to trade and somehow get 
control of land that they are not enti-
tled to in order just to say: We recog-
nize Israel. 
Yes, we want all Arab nations to rec-
ognize Israel, and this is something 
this President has done. But this is the 
area that involves not just two coun-
tries, Morocco and Israel. It is all of 
the countries in Africa, virtually ev-
erybody in East and West Africa and 
all the surrounding area. They all 
agree that that is the territory of 
Western Sahara and that they should 
have a referendum of self-determina-
tion. 
We all have agreed with that for 
years. We are talking about back to 
1966. Everyone is in agreement that 
they are the ones who are entitled to 
that. 
So in 1991 they had a ceasefire, and a 
mission began to provide a referendum 
for self-determination. That was the 
United Nations and virtually every-
body else. Everyone was in agreement 
on that. Certainly, it was initiated 
from the United Nations, and that was 
to have a ceasefire in 1991, by the U.N., 
and work toward a self-determination. 
Then, in 2004, the United States and 
Morocco signed a free-trade agreement. 
Now, this is kind of interesting, be-
cause this is a joint effort between our 
country, the United States, and Mo-
rocco for a free-trade agreement. In 
that free-trade agreement, they agreed 
to explicitly exclude Western Sahara 
because Morocco does not have sov-
ereignty over it. Now, that was in the 
agreement in 2004 that was signed by 
both the United States and Morocco. 
So they agreed at that time, as every-
one else did, that that should be an 
independent country with the right of 
self-determination. 
Then the African Union came along. 
So far, you have the United Nations. 
You have the United States and Mo-
rocco in a signed free-trade agreement. 
But then you also had Morocco, when 
it joined the AU, signing a document. 
This is when it came from the African 
Union. They recognized Western Sa-
hara as its own country. This is the Af-
rican Union. 
Now, we are talking about 52 nations 
in the African Union that all agree on 
this. No one is in disagreement on this. 
And then Morocco, when it joined the 
AU, signed a document. When they 
joined the African Union—we are talk-
ing about Morocco now, up on the 
northeast edge of that territory. When 
they joined the AU, or the African 
Union, they signed a document ac-
knowledging all member states and 
their borders; that is, acknowledging 
the Western Sahara area as not a part 
of Morocco. Now, this is Morocco 
agreeing to this. 
So you have the United Nations in 
1991. You have the United States and 
Morocco in the free-trade agreement in 
2004. You have an agreement explicitly 
stating where the lines should be. Then 
you have the African Union coming 
along and recognizing. This is all of the 
countries, 52 nations in the African 
Union. So we have all of them in agree-
ment with this. 
South Africa is the present chair of 
the AU, and one of their priorities is to 
resolve the Western Sahara issue. 
Now, all of that happened prior to 
today. And, as I say in my written 
statement, I really believe—I know our 
President has a big heart. I have ar-
gued for him and to benefit him. The 
various times that we have had con-
flicts out there—and one of them was 
when they came out with a statement 
that they were going to immediately— 
this was a couple of years ago—move 
the people out of Germany and move 
them back to the United States; that 
that was going to be done before the 
end of the year. And I made the public 
statement. That was not the President 
talking. That was a policy that came 
out of the White House, and I seriously 
doubted that he even knew about it 
and certainly would not agree with it. 
If there is one thing the President is 
compassionate about, it is the families. 
You can’t just uproot the families who 
were stationed in Germany and move 
them back to the United States—kids 
in school and all these things. He is a 
compassionate person. He is the first 
one in line to take care of our troops 
every time there is a problem. 
This is the same situation. In this 
case, he is not the type of person that 
would bag the freedom-loving people of 
Western Sahara to Morocco. 
So that is what happened. This is an 
old issue. It dates back to 1966. I can 
remember—and 
this 
is 
highly 
un-
usual—as a Member of the U.S. Senate, 
there was a hearing in the House—this 
is about maybe 5 or 6 years ago—and I 
served. I asked to be a witness in that 
hearing. 
The hearing was about Western Sa-
hara and Morocco. Now, keep in mind 
that Morocco is a very wealthy coun-
try. Virtually every lobbyist in Wash-
ington is paid by them. At that time, I 
could remember standing there in that 
hearing, in the House of Representa-
tives, and listening to all the lobbyists 
that they had hired against a country 
that didn’t have any money. 
They don’t have, really, any formal 
armaments. They are heroic people. 
They are fighters. They want to con-
tinue to fight for their freedom, but 
they don’t have the resources. 
So this is way back then, and I point-
ed out that Morocco has used all of 
their wealth to try to get the land that 
justly belongs to Western Saharan peo-
ple. So that is not anything new. That 
has been happening for a long time. 
At that time, I remember I took the 
transcript at that time—I think it was 
6 or 7 years ago—in that hearing. I said 
that Morocco owns every lobbyist in 
Washington, DC, and it is kind of the 
giant out there against this small 
group of people who are being thrown 
out of their land that they justly own. 
It is self-determination. Who can 
fight and argue against self-determina-
tion? Certainly, our President is not 
the type of person who would fight 
against self-determination. He would 
be for self-determination. That is the 
kind of person he is. That is why this 
thing—I just think it is some poor ad-
vice from some advisers that threw in 
that thing. 
As I said in my formal statement, he 
could have done that with them with-
out giving away the rights and the land 
of the Western Saharan people. 
So I just want to make sure that ev-
eryone knows that this is—I strongly 
support everything that this President 
has successfully been doing in bringing 
the Arab world into the Israeli world 
and doing something for peace in the 
Middle East. 
Everybody else has tried. Every Dem-
ocrat and Republican President I can 
think of, in memory, has tried to do 
this and has not been successful, until 
this President did it. 
It is just, in this case, I don’t think 
it was necessary to give away—to 
stand up the people, the just people in 
an area where they don’t have any re-
sources. They have been living in the

desert. Three generations now have 
come and gone, and all of them know 
that at one time there was peace and 
they owned their land and that day 
would come that they would get their 
land back. That hasn’t happened yet. 
I think with this mistake that was 
made, it is certainly not in the interest 
of all of our friends. I say that without 
any exceptions. They are all on our 
side on this thing. Our policy has been 
clear since 1966, and we have been com-
mitted. 
Some time ago, 1994, I came from the 
House to the Senate, and I had a long 
visit at that time with Jim Baker, who 
had been the Secretary of State in the 
previous administrations. I called him 
up, and I said: You know, this is such 
a huge injustice, what has happened, 
what Morocco has done to these people 
of Western Sahara. 
He said: You are right, and we have 
done everything. 
I said: We have got to change that, 
and I am going to make that commit-
ment. 
This was back in 1994. 
He said: Well, I admire you for doing 
it. I will do all I can to cooperate with 
you. 
This is Jim Baker talking. 
He said: I don’t think you will be able 
to do it because they have too many re-
sources, too much money, and the 
Western Saharan people don’t have any 
money. They don’t have any resources. 
And they are the ones who have been 
abused in this. 
He said: Good luck. I will do every-
thing I can to help you. 
That was back when Jim Baker was 
Secretary of State. That was a long 
time ago. Since that time, every ad-
ministration—and not just Republican 
administrations but Democratic ad-
ministrations—have all been lined up 
saying: This is a sense of fairness. It is 
something that has to be corrected. We 
can’t allow that giant to take over the 
righteous people. 
And that is what has happened. So it 
is not over yet. I can assure you that I 
will make every effort I can to make 
sure that we go back to the policy that 
we had and that ultimately we will 
achieve. Maybe this will be just the 
thing. This shock treatment for the 
American people and for people around 
the world might be just the thing that 
is going to offer them an opportunity 
for a referendum for self-determina-
tion. Who can be against a referendum 
for self-determination? Certainly no 
Americans whom I know of. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
TRIBUTE TO SHARON PIERCE 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise 
today to commend an outstanding Hoo-
sier whose work in Indiana’s child and 
family welfare system has touched 
countless lives, including my own. 
Sharon Pierce, president and CEO of 
The Villages—a nonprofit child and 
family services agency—will soon be 
retiring after a distinguished 47-year 
career of serving our children and our 
families. 
Sharon also happens to be my aunt, 
and I have seen firsthand her love and 
dedication to Indiana’s children. Her 
call to service started early in life. 
When she was young, Sharon’s mother 
volunteered at a youth home in Fort 
Wayne. She and her siblings would help 
her mother with holiday parties. It was 
there that she first learned how impor-
tant the family is to a child. 
A graduate of Ball State University, 
Sharon’s entire career since then has 
been dedicated to public service. Prior 
to her work at The Villages, she 
worked for several youth advocacy pro-
grams in Illinois. She also served as a 
deputy director at the Indiana Division 
of Family and Children—the forerunner 
of today’s Indiana Department of Child 
Services. While at the Division of Fam-
ily and Children, she helped create a 1– 
800 number to report suspected child 
abuse. She also established the Healthy 
Families Initiative, which still today 
provides resources to at-risk, first-time 
parents to help prevent abuse and ne-
glect. 
In 1992, she became the president and 
CEO of The Villages, where she has cre-
ated a culture of compassion and a 
deep commitment to supporting fami-
lies in need. At The Villages, children 
are enrolled in family and child sup-
port services, with the goal of helping 
to keep family members together. The 
Villages also provides foster care and 
offers support for relatives and family 
friends who are helping to raise a child, 
including education and child abuse 
prevention services. 
Sharon has said: ‘‘Even though The 
Villages is probably best known for 
high-quality foster care, the reality is 
we want to do anything we can to keep 
families together.’’ 
‘‘Anything we can to keep families 
together’’—it is hard to imagine a mis-
sion more critical than this. 
I am not the only one to offer my 
praise for Sharon Pierce. Indiana’s 
Governor, Eric Holcomb, said the fol-
lowing: 
Sharon’s saintly efforts over the decades 
touched the lives of countless Hoosier chil-
dren. She taught, inspired, led so many oth-
ers over the years to invest in those who 
need it the most. 
Indiana Department of Child Services 
Director Terry Stigdon said: 
She exudes compassion and caring. . . . It’s 
just innate to her being. 
Sharon has dedicated her profes-
sional life to ensuring children have a 
bright future, regardless of their cir-
cumstances. Her work has inspired 
countless others, including me, and the 
policies I choose to focus on here in the 
Senate. 
I know my Aunt Sharon is looking 
forward to spending more time with 
her husband—my Uncle Steve—their 
four children, and now their seven 
grandchildren. She has more than 
earned this next chapter in her life. 
But as a point of personal privilege and 
on behalf of the people of Indiana, I 
offer my heartfelt thanks for her dec-
ades of service, and I wish her very well 
in this next chapter. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
have to tell you, every day, I am hear-
ing from Tennesseans who are asking 
what we are going to do about COVID 
relief. It is coming up in nearly every 
conversation that I have—with our 
county mayors, with citizens, with em-
ployers and employees; conversations 
with those who have lost their jobs 
through no fault of their own. Why 
can’t we get something done? 
The phones really started ringing 
last week when Speaker PELOSI, the 
Speaker of the House, accidentally re-
vealed that it was politics and not 
principle that convinced her to spend 
months—months—standing 
between 
the American people and targeted re-
lief that they are asking for and that 
they desperately need. It was politics— 
all politics to her. People were pawns 
that she was moving around, trying to 
get her way. 
It is disgusting. It is a tragedy. But I 
will tell you this: It is nothing new. In 
fact, since July, Democrats have con-
tinuously blocked efforts to provide 
targeted relief. The minority leader ob-
structed these efforts in the hopes of 
passing a $3 trillion bill. That is right, 
trillion—$3 trillion bill. It was filled to 
the brim with partisan proposals that 
had nothing do with the pandemic and 
a bailout for fiscally irresponsible 
States and cities. 
Tennesseans are very much opposed 
to having their hard-earned dollars 
that are tax dollars that come to the 
Federal Government used to bail out 
States that have chosen not to be fis-
cally responsible. They say: Above all 
else, do not bail out these States, these 
cities, these pension funds. 
Let’s be clear to the American peo-
ple. It is the Speaker of the House and 
the minority leader who are holding 
noncontroversial relief—they are hold-
ing it hostage. There should be another 
round of PPP. There should be another 
increase, a plus-up, of unemployment. 
There should be more money for vac-
cines, testing, and getting children 
back to school. But, oh, no. For 
months, what did they want to do? 
Play politics. Play politics with peo-
ple’s lives. If that isn’t the most tone- 
deaf thing that I have ever heard, I 
don’t know what is. Perhaps some of 
my friends across the aisle should 
check their mail and make certain that 
their office phones are being answered. 
People are quite upset with them. 
It doesn’t stop there. I wish it did. It 
only gets worse. In the fall, the Demo-
crats filibustered targeted relief pro-
posals not once but twice and rejected

December 10, 2020 
a much needed extension of the Pay-
check Protection Program almost as 
soon as it was proposed. This month, 
more of the same. Their refusal to ne-
gotiate in good faith has made it abun-
dantly clear to the business owners, 
the healthcare providers, and millions 
of other struggling Americans that 
partisan grandstanding is more of a 
priority for Democrats than doing 
their jobs. 
The American people are not pawns, 
and it is time my colleagues in the mi-
nority stopped treating them as such. 
The House Speaker and Senate Demo-
crats might have all the time in the 
world to stall. Maybe they are pretty 
comfortable with where they are. But 
outside of this Chamber, for a lot of 
our families and small businesses that 
are struggling, it is the eleventh hour. 
Now is not the moment to strong-arm 
the U.S. Senate into rubberstamping a 
radical liberal wish list. It is time to 
step up and deliver relief—targeted re-
lief, relief we all agree will mean the 
difference between survival for many of 
these small businesses and economic 
collapse; money and support for vac-
cines; another full round of PPP fund-
ing for the businesses that need it 
most; and support for our frontline he-
roes and essential workers. 
This bullet list of absolute essentials 
must also include reasonable, respon-
sible liability protections for small 
businesses 
and 
healthcare 
workers. 
These protections are the flip side of 
relief funding. Without them, we take 
these business owners and workers out 
of one bad situation and put them right 
into another one. Without them, we ef-
fectively force entire industries to 
choose between economic survival or, 
in the case of healthcare workers, lit-
eral survival and death by opportun-
istic lawsuits. We can’t allow this to 
happen. 
One of the things that I have noticed 
this past year is how critical it is for 
us to be able to articulate problems 
and lay the foundation to address them 
before an emergency strikes. 
In Tennessee, as in many other 
States, the number of people who live 
in rural and remote areas poses chal-
lenges when it comes to providing a va-
riety of services that we all consider 
essential, 
chiefly 
among 
them, 
healthcare delivery and access to high- 
speed internet. I have worked with 
healthcare practitioners and advocates 
to cut a path forward for the wide-
spread use of telemedicine. 
Last year, I introduced the Rural 
Health Agenda to increase access to 
healthcare for the 60 million Ameri-
cans who leave in rural areas. A crucial 
component of that legislative package 
was a set of provisions that lifted un-
necessary regulatory barriers standing 
in the way of access to telemedicine. 
As always, it is the redtape that slows 
up progress. The pandemic only high-
lighted the importance of opening up 
contact-free access to healthcare. 
Fortunately, in March, after a lot of 
meetings with the White House and 
Medicare and Medicaid Services Ad-
ministrator Seema Verma, we were 
able to roll back a particularly frus-
trating regulation preventing the use 
of telemedicine by Medicare enrollees. 
Provisions I supported as part of the 
CARES Act further expanded access to 
telemedicine by removing even more of 
that redtape and providing funding for 
reimbursement to frontline healthcare 
providers. 
Of course, access to telehealth and 
access to high-speed internet go hand 
in hand. You can’t really have one 
without the other. 
This week, I learned that the FCC, as 
a result of the recent Rural Digital Op-
portunity Fund auction, has now made 
some great steps, and Tennessee is 
going to receive about $150 million to 
help close the digital divide over the 
next decade. These new connections 
will be a game changer for rural and 
underserved communities. Not only 
will they open up access to telehealth, 
distance learning, and remote work op-
portunities, they will open up the local 
economy and encourage growth and 
outside investment because these dol-
lars are targeted to unserved areas. 
This award, coupled with CARES Act 
funding put to work earlier this year, 
will help us build on our prepandemic 
work on behalf of rural and unserved 
Americans. 
The Internet Exchange Act, a bipar-
tisan bill I sponsored to provide grant 
funding for broadband infrastructure, 
recently reported out of our Commerce 
Committee. 
The pieces are, indeed, falling into 
place, and, hopefully, we can keep the 
momentum going and finally get this 
job done: closing the digital divide, 
providing everyone with access to high- 
speed internet and allowing commu-
nities that have been cut off from eco-
nomic development, from telehealth, 
from remote learning to enhanced law 
enforcement—allowing them to ben-
efit. 
It 
is 
not 
just 
a 
matter 
of 
connectivity or convenience. It is an 
investment in a better quality of life 
for all Americans who call the rural 
parts of this country home. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask

TRIBUTE TO KEVIN RYAN 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, for those 
of us who have the privilege of working 
in the U.S. Senate, it allows us the op-
portunity to meet wonderful people 
who care about their country, who go 
to work every day and make sure that 
the country is safe and secure. 
One of those individuals, whom I met 
over the last year—met a year ago and 
now has worked in my office—is Army 
LTC Kevin Ryan. He is a member of my 
staff as an Army fellow participating 
in the U.S. Army Congressional Fel-
lowship Program. 
I want to take a moment to recognize 
LTC Kevin Ryan’s contribution, cer-
tainly, to my office, to my capabilities 
of representing Kansas in the U.S. Sen-
ate, but his commitment to the coun-
try as well. 
Before he departs my office to return 
to the big Army at the start of the new 
year, I want to express my apprecia-
tion to Colonel Ryan for all of his hard 
work and his dedication and his service 
to our country. 
Kevin’s 14 years of service in the U.S. 
Army have developed his leadership 
abilities and shaped his perspective on 
major defense issues of national sig-
nificance. These assets and attributes 
have made him an invaluable asset for 
our team as we work to serve Kansans, 
members of the military, and our vet-
erans. 
Before joining our office, Kevin’s as-
signments have taken him around the 
world in service to our country. 
Kevin earned his commission from 
Norwich University, the Military Col-
lege of Vermont. He has served four 
combat tours, two in Afghanistan and 
two in Iraq, and he has also been de-
ployed to Korea, Germany, and Italy. 
His most recent deployment took him 
to Iraq in 2017, where he served as a 
senior intelligence officer for the bri-
gade that assisted Iraqi security forces 
in the liberation of Mosul from the Is-
lamic State. 
Kevin is lucky to have his wife 
Lindsey, his daughter Colleen, and son 
John by his side. He is blessed to have 
their unwavering support. 
Kevin joined our team in January of 
2019. From day one, he embraced Kan-
sas, its people, and the challenges they 
face day in and day out. He is well 
known for displaying his love of Kansas 
outwardly, often wearing a Kansas 
necktie in meetings and on Zoom calls. 
He has made it a priority to spend 
time in our State and learn from Kan-
sans so he can bring their thoughts and 
ideas back to the Nation’s Capital. 
These 
personal 
conversations 
with 
Kansans and Kevin’s experience in the 
Army helped drive meaningful policy. 
He has led the efforts to recognize 
the important work of the 6888th Cen-
tral Postal Directory Battalion, the 
only all-African-American, all-female 
battalion to be deployed overseas dur-
ing World War II. The Six Triple Eight, 
as this battalion has come to be 
known, sorted millions of pieces of 
backlogged mail so the troops serving 
on the frontlines could hear from fami-
lies and loved ones. Their efforts boost-
ed morale and directly contributed to 
our servicemembers’ fighting spirit to-
ward the end of the war. Kevin has 
been a tireless advocate for these 
women, and I commend his dedication 
to this cause. 
Though I am sad he will be leaving 
our office at the end of the month, I 
know he will serve the Army well next

year in the Army’s programs office, 
where he will be a highly effective am-
bassador to Congress for the Army. 
Kevin is one of the most impressive 
military officers I have had the honor 
of knowing. I hold him in the highest 
regard, personally and professionally. 
He is a significant asset to our country 
and to the U.S. Army. Kevin represents 
the best the Army has to offer, and I 
know he will continue to benefit the 
future of our Nation. 
There is no group of people I hold in 
higher regard than those who serve our 
Nation, and I want to reiterate my 
gratitude to Kevin and to his family 
for their dedication and service to our 
Nation. 
Once again, Kevin, thank you for all 
you have done for Kansans, all you 
have done for our team as we serve 
those Kansans. You have been a model 
of selfless service and leadership. I 
know you will continue to do great 
things throughout your Army career 
and your life of service, wherever that 
path may lead. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we are 
currently in the midst of the worst mo-
ment of the pandemic up until now. 
We have recordbreaking numbers of 
deaths, of diagnoses of people with 
COVID–19, of hospitals unable to ac-
commodate even more people. 
And in the midst of this pandemic, 
obviously, we are also in a severe eco-
nomic meltdown, and there are econo-
mists who are telling us that the des-
peration of working families in this 
country today, right now, is worse than 
at any time since the Great Depres-
sion. 
In Vermont and all over this country, 
we have workers who have lost their 
jobs and their income; people who are, 
by the millions, behind in their rent 
and are afraid of being evicted, afraid 
of losing their homes; people who have 
lost their health insurance, unable to 
go to a doctor. In the midst of a ter-
rible pandemic, they don’t have health 
insurance, can’t go to a doctor when 
they get sick. 
And what we are seeing today is a 
record number of Americans who are 
struggling, literally, with hunger, un-
able to feed their kids. I know in 
Vermont and all over this country 
there are lines of automobiles, cars of 
people—people who had never received 
governmental help—in line for emer-
gency bags of groceries. 
That is what is going on in this coun-
try today. 
Now, back in March, in the beginning 
of the pandemic, this Congress came 
together—Democrats and Republicans 
and President Trump came together— 
and virtually unanimously passed the 
CARES Act, $2.2 trillion, which, among 
many other features, provided a $600 
supplement to unemployment benefits 
for 4 months and $1,200 direct payments 
for every working-class adult in this 
country, plus $500 for their children. 
And here is the truth: That program, 
that CARES Program, saved lives, gave 
dignity to people who were at their 
wit’s end, and saved this economy from 
further downfall. 
Well, today, we are where we are, 
which is at another terrible moment in 
this pandemic, and this Congress must 
act. We cannot leave here to go home 
to our families for the Christmas holi-
days while other families throughout 
this country, by the millions, are won-
dering how they are going to pay the 
rent or feed their kids. We cannot do 
that. 
And I am proud to say that Senator 
HAWLEY
from Missouri and I have 
worked together on a pretty simple 
amendment that he will be talking 
about in a second, which says that we 
must include in any legislation that is 
passed a direct payment of $1,200 for 
adults and $500 for kids. 
We cannot, we must not leave Wash-
ington unless we do that. And next 
week I am going to do everything that 
I can to make sure that that happens. 
We cannot, we will not leave Wash-
ington unless we make certain that 
millions of families have the economic 
assistance that they need. 
So we are working on bipartisan leg-
islation, and Senator HAWLEY has done 
a very, very good job on this, and I am 
proud to yield the floor to him. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I am 
delighted to join with Senator SANDERS 
in this important legislation. 
It is very simple legislation, and this 
is, to my mind, a very simple propo-
sition. Here is the proposition: that 
when it comes to COVID relief in the 
midst of this crisis, working families 
and working people should be first to 
get relief, not last. Their interests, 
their needs should be first on our to-do 
list, not last. 
Now, I have heard some of my col-
leagues say that there just isn’t enough 
left for working families; that once we 
take care of our other priorities in 
COVID relief, there just isn’t enough 
left to give direct assistance to individ-
uals. 
I want to respectfully suggest that 
those priorities are exactly reversed. 
We should begin with the working peo-
ple of this country, and that is why the 
legislation that Senator SANDERS and I 
are introducing, which I believe every 
Senator voted for in March—it is sim-
ple legislation—$1,200 for each indi-
vidual, $2,400 for a couple, and $500 for 
every dependent in the family. It is ex-
actly what this Congress approved 
overwhelmingly back in March, and it 
was, indeed, a lifeline. I know it was 
for Missourians in my State, for work-
ing families in my State. 
I remember, in the hours and days 
after Congress passed this in March, 
fielding call after call after call from 
friends, from people I didn’t know in 
my State but whom I represent, who 
called me to say: First of all, is it real-
ly true? Are we actually going to be 
getting this support? And then just to 
say thank you. 
And I said: Don’t thank me. Thank 
you for being the ones who have built 
this country, the ones who sustain this 
country, the ones on whom this coun-
try depends. 
And I will just say also, as a matter 
of fairness—if the U.S. Government is 
going to shut down your business, if it 
is going to tell you to go home for 
health reasons, if it is going to give 
you no choice in the matter, I think 
that there is an obligation to support 
and help the people who are affected, 
through no fault of their own. Let’s be 
clear. The millions of Americans who 
are out of work because of this pan-
demic, they haven’t done anything 
wrong. The 853,000 Americans who 
today, the new numbers tell us, filed 
for unemployment benefits, they are 
not at fault in this pandemic. 
We want to support and stand with 
working individuals and working fami-
lies. I want the working people of Mis-
souri to know that they are first on the 
priority list, and when it comes to 
COVID relief, we will not leave this 
town until we have voted—up or 
down—until we have voted on direct re-
lief for working people in my State, in 
Senator SANDERS’s State, and in every 
State in this Union. 
With that, I thank Senator SANDERS, 
and I yield back. 
Mr. SANDERS. Well, thank you very 
much, Senator. 
And let me just say this: In March, as 
Senator HAWLEY indicated, we came to-
gether, and I had the same experience 
in Vermont. People in desperation 
called the office: When can we get the 
check? We desperately need it. And I 
suspect it was the same thing in Texas 
and the same thing in every other 
State in this country. People are hurt-
ing. 
We cannot go home unless we address 
the needs of those people. And the 
amendment that Senator HAWLEY and I 
are introducing could not be simpler. It 
is $1,200 in direct payment for adults up 
to a certain limit—the same limit as 
was in the CARES Act—and $500 for 
their children. We have already voted 
and passed that exact same provision 
in March, and the situation today is 
not better. In some respects, it is 
worse. 
So I would hope that we would have 
bipartisan support for this legislation. 
Look, it is no great secret, whether 
you are a Republican, Democrat, or 
whatever, that people are losing faith 
in their government. They are hurting; 
their kids are hurting; their parents 
are hurting. They look to Washington 
and they say: Do you know that we 
exist or are you just worried about 
your rich friends and your campaign 
contributors?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7413 
December 10, 2020 
In this moment of economic crisis, 
we have got to do everything that we 
can to restore faith that this govern-
ment works for ordinary people. So let 
us do the right thing. Let us pass this 
amendment in a bipartisan way. Let us 
show the working families of America 
that we understand what they are 
going through, and we are going to 
stand with them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 2420 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am 
glad to be here on the floor of the Sen-
ate 
with 
my 
friend 
Senator 
BOB 
MENENDEZ asking that the U.S. Senate 
advance legislation to establish a Na-
tional 
Museum 
of 
the 
American 
Latino. 
As a proud Texan, I am fortunate to 
have grown up in a State steeped in the 
contributions of Hispanics and Latinos. 
Approximately 40 percent of our popu-
lation is composed of Latinos in Texas, 
but they are not monolithic by any 
stretch of the imagination, which is 
why we need a museum to tell their 
stories. 
There are the Tejanos, whose roots in 
the Lone Star State predate our state-
hood or even Texas independence, as 
well as those who have emigrated from 
other States or countries and have cho-
sen to call Texas home more recently. 
From the brave soldiers who fought 
in the Texas Revolution to the civil 
rights activists like Cesar Chavez, cul-
tural icons like Selena, and leaders of 
all types in our communities, genera-
tions of Latino Americans have shaped 
our country as it is today. But, as I 
suggested a moment ago, many Ameri-
cans simply aren’t aware of the vast 
contributions made by these men and 
women who have come before us, and 
one critical way we can right this 
wrong is by providing a home for their 
stories in the Nation’s Capital. 
I have heard somebody suggest that 
we don’t need a separate museum for 
different 
racial 
groups 
and 
ethnic 
groups or the like, but this is far more 
important than that because the story 
of American Latinos is the story of 
America itself. Many people simply 
aren’t familiar with the vast contribu-
tions they have made. 
This particular effort has been under-
way for more than 25 years. Nothing 
happens 
very 
quickly, 
particularly 
when it comes to establishing a new 
museum like this, but we are just two 
steps away, and I hope the Senate can 
take one big step this afternoon by 
passing this bipartisan legislation and 
sending it to the President’s desk for 
his signature. 
I know there are some of our col-
leagues who have concerns about the 
museum’s location, and I can assure 
them that Congress will have a voice in 
the site of this museum. But before 
construction can begin, congressional 
committees will be consulted on site 
selection as laid out in the bill and I 
believe the colloquy that will be made 
a part of this record. 
The Smithsonian Board of Regents, 
which will select the site, is chaired by 
the Supreme Court Chief Justice and 
comprises multiple Members of Con-
gress, including three sitting Senators 
and the Vice President. The Congress 
will also need to appropriate funds to 
supplement the private fundraising 
that will help finance this museum. 
The appropriation requirement will be 
a de facto ratification or rejection of 
the site selected by the Smithsonian 
Board of Regents. So there is going to 
be a lot of input in that decision. We 
are not making that decision here 
today. And I believe there need to be 
open lines of communication between 
Members of Congress and the Smithso-
nian Board of Regents as they under-
take this significant project. 
It has been estimated that if we pass 
this bill today, the doors to a new mu-
seum will not open for at least a dec-
ade, so I am eager to get the process 
moving. 
The National Museum of the Amer-
ican Latino will honor and preserve the 
stories of Latinos throughout Amer-
ican history so generations can view a 
more accurate and more complete his-
tory of the contributions made by 
these great Americans, and I hope the 
Senate will advance this critical legis-
lation today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
have come to the floor today and will 
shortly ask for unanimous consent on 
H.R. 2420, the National Museum for the 
American Latino Act. 
Let me just thank my colleague, the 
senior Senator from Texas, Mr. COR-
NYN, who has been a great partner 
throughout 
this 
entire 
process, 
a 
strong advocate who helped us navi-
gate some of the challenges we have 
had along the way. I am also thrilled to 
be on the floor with Senator COLLINS, 
who will shortly make a motion on the 
Women’s History Museum, which I 
strongly support, and I appreciate her 
support for the American Latino Mu-
seum. 
Today the Senate stands at the preci-
pice of history. We have before us an 
opportunity to set in motion a process 
that will eventually culminate in the 
establishment of a national museum 
devoted to the history, struggles, and 
achievements of Latinos and Latinas in 
the United States. This is long over-
due. 
Some colleagues say: Well, why do we 
need another museum? Well, it was in 
1994 when the Smithsonian Task Force 
on Latino Issues published its report 
entitled ‘‘Willful Neglect’’—a report 
acknowledging the Institution’s own 
glaring omission of Hispanic history 
and culture. 
This is what the report found: 
The Smithsonian Institution, the largest 
museum complex in the world, displays a 
pattern of willful neglect towards . . . 
Latinos in the United States. Because of 
both indigenous roots and Spanish heritage, 
Latinos predate the British in the [United 
States]. They have contributed significantly 
to every phase and aspect of American his-
tory and culture. Yet the institution almost 
entirely excludes and ignores Latinos in 
nearly every aspect of its operations. 
Latinos are absent from positions of power 
and authority within the institution, which 
helps to perpetuate the exclusion of Latino 
history and culture from the museum’s col-
lections, exhibitions, and programs. 
The report also acknowledges how 
the Smithsonian’s exclusion of Latinos 
and Latinas has not only harmed His-
panic Americans but all Americans. 
The report says: 
The failure of the Smithsonian to reflect 
and represent Hispanic contributions is 
twice damaging. It denies Latinos their right 
to feel recognized and valued as part of the 
country’s heritage. At the same time, it per-
petuates among the general population the 
inaccurate belief that Latinos have contrib-
uted little to our country’s development or 
culture, rather than reflecting the multicul-
tural history . . . of the United States. 
Without treading into politics, I 
think it is important we acknowledge 
that this misconception is alive and 
well today. In recent years, we have 
heard 
Hispanic 
Americans, 
immi-
grants, and their families used as 
scapegoats for every economic ill fac-
ing our Nation. We have witnessed the 
rise of nativism and xenophobia. We 
have seen these hateful statements 
propel acts of horrific violence like the 
tragic El Paso shooting. 
But we Latinos and Latinas are not 
invaders. We have been here from the 
beginning. The oldest city in America, 
well before Pilgrims and Jamestown, is 
St. Augustine, FL, over 500 years ago 
founded by a gentleman named Pedro 
Aviles de Menendez. And our stories 
must be told. 
Who here does not emerge from the 
Smithsonian Museum of American His-
tory more informed about the many 
movements that have shaped our coun-
try? Who does not emerge from the Mu-
seum of the American Indian more 
aware of Native American history and 
more appreciative of their cultures? 
Who does not emerge from the Museum 
of African American History inspired 
by the perseverance and the power of 
our Black community? We all do. The 
Smithsonian Institution is truly a na-
tional treasure. 
But I am not White or Black or Na-
tive American. I am Latino. I am one 
in five Americans today. My grand-
children are one in four schoolchildren 
today. But when we walk through the 
National Mall—or should I say when 
anyone walks through the National 
Mall, no one is inspired by the story of 
Latinos and Latinas in this country be-
cause that story is not being told. 
Walk outside these halls and ask 
someone who Bernardo de Galvez was, 
the former Governor of Louisiana be-
fore Louisiana was a State, who led an 
all-Spanish division against the British 
as they were approaching Washington 
and helped in the Revolutionary War? 
The Congress gave him U.S. citizen-
ship. His portrait was supposed to be 
hung in the Congress of the United 
States, so much was the battle that he

led. His portrait finally hangs in the 
Senate Foreign Relations room. 
Go to Farragut metro station and 
ask a rider who it was named for. 
David Farragut, the Spanish captain 
who led during the Civil War on behalf 
of the Union. 
Visit a school and ask a child where 
the first settlers to this country hailed 
from. They won’t say St. Augustine, 
FL. 
I guarantee these questions will go 
unanswered because the history of the 
American Latino remains unknown. 
It has been nearly 30 years since the 
Smithsonian Task Force on Latino 
Issues recommended that the Institu-
tion immediately begin laying ‘‘the 
groundwork needed to assure the estab-
lishment of one or more museums por-
traying the historical, cultural, and ar-
tistic achievements of U.S. Hispanics.’’ 
Thirty years. For nearly 30 years, those 
words have echoed on empty ears. My 
friends, that silence and inaction must 
end today. 
We Hispanics are not a monolithic 
community. Our families are as diverse 
as they come. We are Puerto Rican, 
Mexican, Cuban, Colombian, Spanish, 
Salvadoran, and more. We are Brown, 
Black, and White, left and right, and 
everywhere in between. Some of our 
ancestors settled here long before the 
dawn of our Republic; others arrived 
alongside generations of immigrants 
around the world searching for freedom 
and opportunity. Some of us grew up 
along our southern border in cities and 
communities born out of blended cul-
tures. 
Some of us, myself included, are 
first-generation Americans. Our par-
ents courageously uprooted their lives 
and came to this country with no con-
nection at all in order to give their 
children a brighter future. 
Indeed, that story of hard work and 
boundless optimism is the common 
thread 
that 
runs 
throughout 
our 
Latino community—all 60 million of us 
living in the United States. And I 
would argue that story is as American 
as they come. 
So let us ensure that the story is told 
right here in the Nation’s Capital, 
where it belongs. Let us pass H.R. 2420. 
Let us ensure that someday in the near 
future, Latino and Latina children and 
other children who walk through our 
National Mall will no longer wonder 
why the story of their families are 
missing. I know I cannot wait for the 
day that I can take my granddaughters 
to the National Museum of the Amer-
ican Latino. 
So it has been a long and winding 
road for this bill, one which I hope will 
complete its path today in Congress. 
This has already been passed by the 
House of Representatives by voice 
vote—no opposition. This passed the 
Rules Committee in a unanimous voice 
vote. 
Now, we have been asked to make 
some changes to accommodate my col-
league, the chair of the Energy and 
Natural 
Resources 
Committee, 
and 
while I personally do not believe that 
these changes are fair to the Latino 
community or required or necessary 
for the bill, I am committed to making 
them to pass this bill and finally mov-
ing one step closer to the construction 
of the museum. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of Calendar No. 
600, H.R. 2420. I ask unanimous consent 
that the Murkowski amendment at the 
desk be agreed to; that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I want to thank my 
friend and colleague, the Senator from 
New Jersey, for bringing this issue to 
the floor today. 
Cultural programs may represent and 
do, in fact, represent a tiny fraction of 
all Federal spending, but they are mag-
nified many times over by virtue of 
their symbolic and their substantive 
impact. Culture is, of course, upstream 
from politics. It is more important, and 
it is more deserving of more of our at-
tention. 
For that reason, the Smithsonian In-
stitution is more than just another line 
item in our Federal budget. It is one of 
the great cultural triumphs of our Re-
public. From the moment of our found-
ing, the United States has faced an al-
most unique problem in history. How 
do we turn our huge Nation’s cultural, 
religious, ethnic, and regional dif-
ferences from a potential weakness 
into a real strength? The way our Na-
tion has always achieved this is by cre-
ating institutions that unite Ameri-
cans around shared interests and the 
mystic chords of collective memory. 
The Constitution, the Senate itself, 
our 
free 
enterprise 
economy, 
our 
Armed Forces and public schools, Fed-
eralism, localism, the First Amend-
ment, and even March Madness all fit 
this bill. They have the power to har-
ness our individual and community dif-
ferences to the common good of the 
whole Nation. 
Now, the Smithsonian Institution 
does the exact same thing. It winds all 
the myriad strands of America’s trium-
phant history into one imperfect but 
heroic story. Americans of every age, 
race, creed, and background come to 
Washington from all over the country 
to visit the Smithsonian museums— 
Natural History, American History, 
Air and Space, American Art, the Na-
tional Zoo. Within the walls of the 
Smithsonian museum, just like at the 
National Gallery of Art or the great 
memorials that dot this city, there is 
no us and them. There is only us. 
So my objection to the creation of a 
new Smithsonian museum or series of 
museums based on group identity— 
what Theodore Roosevelt called ‘‘hy-
phenated Americanism’’—is not a mat-
ter of budgetary or legislative tech-
nicalities. It is a matter of national 
unity and cultural inclusion. 
Now, we have seen in recent years 
what happens when we indulge the cul-
tural and identity balkanization of our 
national 
community. 
The 
so-called 
critical theory undergirding this move-
ment does not celebrate diversity. It 
weaponizes diversity. It sharpens all 
those hyphens into so many knives and 
daggers. It has turned our college cam-
puses into grievance pageants and 
loosed Orwellian mobs to cancel any-
one daring to express an original 
thought. Especially at the end of such 
a fraying, fracturing year, Congress 
should not splinter one of the national 
institutional cornerstones of our dis-
tinct national identity. 
The Smithsonian Institution should 
not have an exclusive Museum of 
American Latino History or a Museum 
of Women’s History or a Museum of 
Americans Men’s History or Mormon 
History or Asian American History or 
Catholic History. American history is 
an inclusive story that should unite 
us—us. 
The Senator from New Jersey is ab-
solutely right that the history of 
American Latinos is a vital part of 
America’s history. So, of course, is the 
history of American women, who have 
written more than half of the Amer-
ican story, going all the way back to 
Plymouth Rock. Their stories are our 
stories, and they are stories that em-
phatically should be told by the Smith-
sonian Institution at the Museum of 
American History, period. No hyphen. 
Now, the Senator from New Jersey is 
well aware of my stingy views on Fed-
eral spending, but if American Latino 
or American women’s history are being 
underrepresented at the Museum of 
American History, that is a problem, 
and that is the problem that we should 
address here. I will happily work with 
him or anyone else to correct those 
problems, 
even 
if 
it 
means 
more 
money, more exhibits, new floors or 
wings. 
I understand what my colleagues are 
trying to do and why, and I respect 
what they are trying to do, and I even 
share their interest in ensuring that 
these stories are told. But the last 
thing we need is to further divide an al-
ready divided Nation with an array of 
segregated, separate-but-equal muse-
ums for hyphenated identity groups. 
At this moment in the history of our 
diverse Nation, we need our Federal 
Government and the Smithsonian In-
stitution itself to pull us closer to-
gether and not further apart. On that 
basis, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
60 million Latinos in this country are 
watching tonight because this is a 
much 
expected 
moment—Univision, 
Telemundo, affiliates across the coun-
try, national organizations, and others. 
They have been waiting for this mo-
ment, a moment that everybody in the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7415 
December 10, 2020 
Congress of the United States agrees to 
except for one colleague. The House of 
Representatives passed this on voice. 
The Rules Committee passed it on 
voice in a bipartisan manner. And to-
night, one colleague stands in the 
way—one Republican colleague from 
Utah stands in the way of the hopes 
and dreams and aspirations of seeing 
Americans of Latino descent having 
their dreams fulfilled in being recog-
nized—just being recognized. 
Now, the Smithsonian is a collection 
of museums. Let’s be honest with that. 
Did we need an Air and Space Museum? 
Do we need a museum of the Native 
Americans? Did we need an African- 
American Museum? I would say yes to 
all of them because they are part of the 
mosaic. They are brought together 
under the rubric of the single most sig-
nificant cultural institution in the Na-
tion, which is the Smithsonian. 
I don’t know if these arguments were 
made against the Native Americans. I 
don’t know if these arguments were 
made against African Americans, but I 
don’t see them as being separate and 
apart. I see them as part of the collec-
tive history mosaic that is coming to-
gether under the Smithsonian. More 
than half of the Nation’s population 
are women. Are we to deny them that 
their history in our country is not 
being told? It is not. It is beyond Betsy 
Ross, who I appreciate very much. 
And, talk about funding, this bill re-
quires that 50 percent of all the funding 
be coming from private sources. So we 
will fuel the development of program-
ming, as well as the physical structure, 
as well as the other elements by the 
community and communities who want 
to see this become a reality. 
It is 30 years of willful neglect. No-
body cared, nobody made any effort, 
and nobody did anything about it. And 
in the one chance we have, since this 
has been a 20-plus year journey to try 
to make this museum possible, one Re-
publican colleague stands in the way. 
One Republican colleague stands in the 
way. It is pretty outrageous. It is pret-
ty outrageous. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI). The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I want to 
be clear about something. All racial, 
ethnic, religious groups in America are 
worthy of celebration, even to the ex-
tent of having their own museums. In-
deed, many of them already do—in 
many instances, institutions and muse-
ums that are not part of or funded by 
the Federal Government in whole or in 
part. If we had more museums and 
fewer tweets, America would certainly 
be better off. 
This isn’t about whether such muse-
ums should exist or not. This is about 
the Smithsonian Institution, which is 
itself federally funded. I understand 
that they also raise a significant por-
tion of their money, but there is a 
brand that comes along with the 
Smithsonian Institution and a lot of 
money that is taken from the Amer-
ican people in the form of tax revenue. 
So, as a result of that, the Smithsonian 
Institution has a unique role and re-
sponsibility in our culture and as a re-
pository and teller of America’s na-
tional story. 
Now, it is absolutely true that Afri-
can Americans and American Indians 
have a unique place in that story in 
that they were rather uniquely, delib-
erately, 
and 
systemically 
excluded 
from it. Unlike many other groups, 
they were persecuted and they were es-
sentially written out of our national 
story and even had their own stories 
virtually erased—not simply by our 
culture or evolving values, but by that 
very same government, this same Fed-
eral Government. 
It is, therefore, uniquely appropriate 
that the Federal Government provide 
the funding to recover and tell those 
communities’ specific stories today at 
dedicated museums in the specific con-
text of having been so long excluded 
from our national community and our 
national story. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
just have to say: We have been system-
ically excluded. We, who founded the 
oldest city in America before there was 
a United States of America; we, who 
ultimately were used as farm workers 
and discriminated against in the Bra-
cero program; we, who were discrimi-
nated against when we voluntarily 
joined the Armed Forces of the United 
States to defend the Nation—we have 
been systematically excluded, not be-
cause this Senator said so but because 
the Smithsonian itself said so. 
And yet we are supposed to entrust 
the willful neglect that has taken place 
for more than three decades—taken 
place longer but acknowledged for 
three decades. Oh, no, we are somehow 
not systemically excluded. Believe me, 
we have been, and the only righteous 
way to end that exclusion is to pass 
this bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, if the 
Smithsonian Institution in its report 
in 1994 in fact acknowledged that it 
systematically excluded the stories of 
any one segment in American society, 
I struggle to understand why the only 
response to that has to be a separate, 
siloed museum. Why not direct them, 
when telling our national story at the 
National Museum of American History, 
to tell that story there. If we have to 
expand it, we will do that. If we have to 
add more floor space and more staff 
and more research, let’s do that. But 
the fact that they have identified their 
own failure over time doesn’t mean 
that they themselves should then get 
to decide that we have a separate, 
siloed museum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, be-
fore I give my remarks, I want to 
strongly associate myself with the 
comments that have been made this 
evening by my colleagues from Texas 
and New Jersey—Senator CORNYN and 
Senator MENENDEZ—in support of a 
museum to celebrate and commemo-
rate the achievements of Latinos in 
our country. 
I could not help but wonder, as I 
heard the comments of my colleague 
from Utah, whether he also tried to 
block the museum celebrating and tell-
ing the history of African Americans, 
that museum which is so popular on 
the Mall. I wondered whether he tried 
to block also the creation of the mu-
seum that tells the story of Native 
Americans. 
I am convinced that if this bill, 
which has just been described by my 
two colleagues, were brought to a vote 
on the Senate floor, it would pass, not 
unanimously, that is clear, but with a 
very strong vote. And it seems wrong 
that one Senator can block consider-
ation of a bill that would have over-
whelming support by a majority of this 
body. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 959 
So, Madam President, I rise today on 
behalf of myself and the Senator from 
California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, to urge the 
Senate to take the important step of 
passing our legislation to establish a 
long overdue women’s history museum 
in our Nation’s Capital. 
This is an issue that I have been 
working on since 2003, when I intro-
duced the first bill to tell the story of 
more than half of our population, of 
the contributions of American women 
to our country in every field: govern-
ment, business, medicine, law, lit-
erature, 
sports, 
entertainment, 
the 
arts, the military, the family. 
Telling the history of American 
women matters, and a museum recog-
nizing our achievements and experi-
ences has long been a goal of many of 
the women and men who serve in this 
Chamber. 
Following 18 months of study by an 
independent, bipartisan commission es-
tablished by Congress, the Commission 
unanimously 
concluded: 
‘‘America 
needs and deserves a physical national 
museum dedicated to showcasing the 
historical experiences and impact of 
women in the country.’’ I agree whole-
heartedly with the Commission’s unan-
imous conclusion. 
This year, we commemorate the 
100th 
anniversary 
of 
suffrage 
for 
women in this country and the dec-
ades-long fight for women’s equality at 
the ballot box. It is extraordinary to 
me that just 100 years ago, not every 
woman in this country was allowed to 
vote in every State. That is not that 
long ago. That story is one of the sto-
ries that needs to be told. 
Amid the celebrations of this historic 
year, I can think of no better way to 
tell the story of American women to 
inspire those young girls and young 
boys who come to Washington to tour 
all the wonderful museums that are 
part of the Smithsonian than to create

December 10, 2020 
a museum of American women’s his-
tory so that they can better under-
stand the contributions of American 
women to the development of our Na-
tion and its proud history. 
As with the legislation that would es-
tablish a museum celebrating and com-
memorating the history of Latino and 
Latina Americans, this legislation has 
passed the House by an overwhelming 
margin. Surely, we ought to be able to 
take it up and pass it here too. 
So, Madam President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of Cal-
endar No. 599, S. 959. I ask unanimous 
consent that the committee-reported 
amendment be withdrawn, the Mur-
kowski amendment at the desk be 
agreed to, and the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. LEE. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
think this is a sad moment. I had 
hoped that we could proceed with both 
of these bills and pass them before the 
end of this year. 
Surely, in a year where we are cele-
brating the 100th anniversary of wom-
en’s suffrage, this is the time, this is 
the moment to finally pass the legisla-
tion unanimously recommended by an 
independent commission to establish 
an American women’s history museum 
in our Nation’s Capital. I regret that 
that will not occur this evening, but we 
will not give up the fight. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COL-
LINS). The Senator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I would like to follow up on the com-
ments you have just shared with your 
support for a women’s history museum 
and also to the comments made by the 
Senator from New Jersey and also the 
Senator from Texas regarding the 
American-Latino museum. 
I am privileged to serve as the chair-
man of the Interior Appropriations 
Subcommittee. As part of that sub-
committee, we have oversight of the 
Smithsonian, and it is an incredibly re-
warding part of the job that I have to 
do with oversight. So I am very well 
aware of these national treasures, what 
they contribute to the education, to 
the dialogue, and to just the motiva-
tion that comes when we know and un-
derstand more about our own country 
and about the people who make up this 
extraordinary mosaic called America 
and how we recognize and how we cele-
brate those contributions, how we ac-
knowledge the challenges that women 
have faced along the way, African 
Americans or Latinos, as they have 
truly been extraordinary participants 
in this American society. 
I 
also 
recognize 
that 
our 
Smithsonians don’t come free. They 
don’t come cheap, as the Senator from 
Utah noted. The Smithsonians are 
funded with significant Federal tax-
payer dollars, so we are required to 
show a level of—exercise with how we 
move forward. And we have been ex-
traordinarily judicious. 
I think, as the Presiding Officer 
noted in her comments, when the dis-
cussion of a women’s history museum 
first came about, it was not just a 
flash-in-the-pan idea. It was something 
that had germinated a long period of 
time. It goes to a commission. There 
are a series of steps and approvals that 
they must go through along the way. 
So the path that we have taken has led 
us to the point today where there has 
been a request made to be able to ad-
vance both of these significant recogni-
tions to American Latina and Amer-
ican women by way of additional 
Smithsonian facilities. 
I support both of those, just as I have 
supported our Smithsonians as new 
ones have come online—the African- 
American museum most recently—or 
the renovations that have been under-
way for a period. 
I also recognize that the effort to-
night made by both the Presiding Offi-
cer, as prime sponsor of the American 
women’s history museum, and incor-
porating an amendment that I had re-
quested that ensures that as we are 
looking to sites for these significant 
facilities, that we are doing so with a 
level of a cooperation. I don’t think 
anybody wants to be in a situation 
where the Smithsonian would effec-
tively be able to tell, whether it is the 
Department of Agriculture or the U.S. 
Forest Service, we want your building. 
That is not how the process works. 
So the amendments that were incor-
porated in both of these measures that 
were before us today, I think, was an 
important one, I think was a signifi-
cant one. 
Some may have heard that LISA 
MURKOWSKI was not supporting these 
museums—far from it. What I wanted 
to ensure is that we have a good, sound 
process for where we site these extraor-
dinarily—extraordinarily important fa-
cilities. 
My hope is that we will resolve this 
impasse 
because 
the 
contributions, 
whether they be from women over the 
decades, the Latina community, Latino 
community, over the decades and the 
centuries, that there be facilities that 
appropriately recognize and celebrate 
them. 
With that, I yield the floor.

MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when 
LAMAR ALEXANDER came to the Senate 
in 2002, he brought with him a wealth 
of experience and years of service to 
the State of Tennessee. As a Senator, 
he has remained a strong advocate for 
his State and its citizens, and as a col-
league, he has shown a willingness to 
work across the aisle for the good of 
his constituents, of the Senate, and of 
the Nation. Our partnership is one that 
I will miss when he leaves the Senate. 
Throughout his career—as Governor 
of Tennessee, as president of the Uni-
versity of Tennessee, and as the Sec-
retary 
of 
Education 
for 
President 
George H.W. Bush, and as a U.S. Sen-
ator—LAMAR has dedicated himself to 
improving education quality and access 
for Tennesseans and all Americans 
alike. He has continued and advanced 
that work as the chairman of the Sen-
ate Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee. Senator ALEXANDER 
has a proven record of working across 
the aisle to develop solutions to our 
country’s most pressing healthcare and 
education challenge, and we know 
there are many. 
I have had the privilege of working 
with Senator ALEXANDER
for many 
years on the Appropriations Com-
mittee. Senator ALEXANDER has been a 
trusted partner on the committee, 
striving 
to 
reach 
bipartisan 
com-
promise, which I believe has long been 
the hallmark of the Appropriations 
Committee. His work as the current 
chairman of the Energy and Water 
Subcommittee has helped make invest-
ments in clean and renewable energy 
initiatives, which in turn have brought 
about economic development and in-
vestment. I have long appreciated the 
work he has done to support agencies, 
programs, and initiatives that improve 
the lives of all Americans. 
In a body as divisive as the Senate 
has come to be in recent times, LAMAR 
has become more than a fellow Sen-
ator; he has become a friend. LAMAR, 
Honey, and their children and grand-
children deserve all the best that the 
coming years have in store for them. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE ENZI 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one fac-
tor that helps make someone a strong 
representative of their constituents is 
the body of experience they bring to 
their job. MIKE ENZI has spent his life 
representing his constituents, first as a 
mayor, then in the Wyoming Senate, 
and ultimately in the U.S. Senate, a 
post to which the people of Wyoming 
have elected and reelected him four 
times. 
While our States are quite different 
geographically, 
Wyoming, 
like 
Vermont, is State of close-knit com-
munities, and it is easy to see how 
deeply Senator ENZI cares for his fellow 
Wyomingites 
and 
how 
firmly 
he 
prioritizes his constituents. As a Sen-
ator, he has worked to expand re-
sources for vocational and technical 
education programs nationwide, and he 
has worked to protect and create jobs 
in Wyoming and across the United 
States as a strong advocate for domes-
tic energy production from a diverse 
array of sources. 
MIKE has been a longtime member 
and top Republican of the Senate Budg-
et Committee and, before that, of the

Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee. Although we cer-
tainly have not agreed on many policy 
issues and priorities over the years, I 
have 
greatly 
appreciated 
working 
alongside Senator ENZI to fund and de-
fine many other legislative priorities 
to meet the needs of the American peo-
ple. 
I will miss my fellow Italian-Irish 
friend. We were a proud caucus of the 
only two Irish-Italian American Sen-
ators. Upon his retirement from the 
Senate, I would like to thank Senator 
ENZI for his service, and Marcelle and I 
wish MIKE and his wife Diana all the 
best. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TOM UDALL 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Pesident, there are 
some for whom public service simply 
isn’t a choice; it runs through their 
veins as a calling and a force that 
draws them to answer an undeniable 
call. TOM UDALL is one of those people, 
and when the curtain closes on this 
116th Congress and on TOM’s service in 
the Senate, it will bookend a career in 
Congress in which the Udalls, a family 
steeped in public service, can take 
great pride. The UDALL legacy will live 
on in its benefits for generations of 
Americans to come. 
First as a Representative to the U.S. 
House and later as a U.S. Senator, TOM 
has consistently fought for the inter-
ests of New Mexico and his State’s peo-
ple. He has been instrumental in the 
passage of legislation that has not only 
brought important resources to the 
people of New Mexico, but has pro-
tected and preserved our environment. 
For his constituents at home, this has 
meant more conservation of public 
lands and significant expansions of ac-
cess to education, healthcare, and land 
tenure rights for Native Americans in 
New Mexico and across the United 
States. 
TOM fought hard to protect the envi-
ronment and invest in a more sustain-
able future. As a member of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee and as the 
ranking member of the Interior and 
Environment Subcommittee, he advo-
cated strongly for continued financial 
assistance for Federal, State, and local 
programs that focus on environmental 
conservation and work to address cli-
mate change and its effects. Critically, 
he fought against draconian budget 
cuts to such entities as the Environ-
mental Protection Agency and fought 
to protect our clean air and clean 
drinking water laws. Working with 
TOM on the Appropriations Committee, 
it has been easy to see his clear dedica-
tion to his constituents, and his de-
voted service to country. 
I was saddened when TOM announced 
his retirement, but I believe TOM will 
never close the door on his public serv-
ice. Marcelle and I wish TOM and his 
wife Jill, and the rest of their family, 
all the best in the coming years. It was 
a privilege to be on the floor of the 
Senate when TOM gave his farewell ad-
dress. Such honesty, patriotism, wis-
dom of how we can and must restore 
the workings of the Senate—all current 
Senators and future Senators should 
listen. 
f 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE 
AMERICAN LATINO ACT 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise 
to engage in a colloquy with the distin-
guished chairman of the Senate Rules 
Committee and the senior Senator 
from Texas with regard to a commit-
ment made between all of us here. 
This commitment is related to the 
[consideration] of H.R. 2420, National 
Museum of the American Latino Act, 
previously reported out of the Rules 
Committee on December 3, and cham-
pioned by Senator CORNYN. 
As chairman of the Senate Com-
mittee on Agriculture, Nutrition. and 
Forestry and having spearheaded the 
effort to design and build the Dwight 
D. Eisenhower Memorial, I appreciate 
the goal of this legislation, but also the 
challenges getting the effort across the 
goal line. 
H.R. 2420 has an honorable cause: to 
build a museum that focuses on the 
legacy of the Latino people, one that is 
embedded in the history of the United 
States. The purpose of the National 
Museum of the American Latino is to 
serve as the premier location for people 
to learn about Latino contributions to 
life, art, history, and culture in the 
United States. 
I support such an effort. However, I 
raise one issue with the legislation, 
that the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture’s historic main headquarters 
building is specified in the bill as a po-
tential location for the museum. 
USDA has been headquartered at the 
location on the National Mall since 
1868. The main building was renamed in 
1995 in honor of one of the longest serv-
ing members of Congress, Jaime L. 
Whitten of Mississippi. I had the pleas-
ure to serve with Chairman Whitten in 
the House. 
USDA provides leadership on issues 
related to food, agriculture, rural de-
velopment, and nutrition. The work of 
the Department benefits residents in 
our rural communities and supports 
agriculture production that feeds hun-
dreds of millions of Americans and oth-
ers throughout theworld. 
The legacy of the Latino people is 
intertwined with the communities that 
USDA serves in rural and urban Amer-
ica. 
I appreciate the efforts of the Com-
mission to Study the Potential Cre-
ation of a National Museum of the 
American 
Latino. 
Having 
recently 
completed the decades-long endeavor 
to establish Ike’s memorial, I am sym-
pathetic to the desire to establish a 
tribute in our Nation’s Capitol. It is 
not an easy process, and there will un-
doubtedly be challenges along the way. 
Attempting to relocate the historic 
headquarters of one of the largest Fed-
eral agencies which serves all Ameri-
cans is a hurdle that can be avoided. 
So I encourage the board of trustees 
of the National Museum of the Amer-
ican Latino and the board of regents of 
the Smithsonian Institution, who are 
responsible for choosing the site loca-
tion of the museum, to work through 
their processes as they finalize a loca-
tion. And as they do so, I encourage 
them to appreciate USDA’s mission 
and constituency when they make hard 
decisions and consider the expense of 
relocating USDA. 
I am pleased that we have come to a 
compact with regard to the location for 
this museum, that we agree here to en-
courage the board of trustees and the 
board regents to break ground on a 
fresh location, rather than a historic 
site of a Department that has served 
and will continue to serve our Nation’s 
farmers, ranchers, growers, and other 
rural stakeholders. 
I now yield to my friend, Mr. BLUNT, 
the senior Senator from Missouri and 
chairman of the Senate Rules Com-
mittee, to offer his perspective. 
Mr. BLUNT. Thank you, Chairman 
ROBERTS. I was pleased the Rules Com-
mittee favorably approved H.R. 2420, 
the National Museum of the American 
Latino Act, earlier this month. 
There is no doubt the stories of the 
American Latino are important and 
must be told more fully than they have 
been in the past. I want to commend 
Senators CORNYN
and MENENDEZ
on 
their diligent efforts to get here. I 
know it has been a long road. 
In order to keep this legislation mov-
ing forward, I agree with Chairman 
ROBERTS on the need to state for the 
record the importance of the U.S. De-
partment 
of 
Agriculture’s 
historic 
main headquarters. 
While that building is listed in the 
bill as a potential location for the mu-
seum, the Senate recognizes the ex-
treme imposition this would place on 
the Department and the people it 
serves. 
As a member of the Appropriations 
Subcommittee 
for 
Agriculture—and 
that subcommittee’s former ranking 
member—I couldn’t agree more with 
Chairman ROBERTS that the work of 
the USDA is crucially important to 
Missouri, to Kansas, to the Nation, and 
the international community as well. 
Clearly, that work would be disrupted 
if the USDA and its staff were forced to 
relocate. 
I join Chairman ROBERTS in encour-
aging the Smithsonian’s board of re-
gents to recognize the role and expanse 
of the USDA when selecting a location 
for the museum and to look for a more 
appropriate site for the museum. 
I now yield to the Senior Senator 
from Texas, an early champion of this 
legislation, for his remarks. 
Mr. CORNYN. Thank you to the sen-
ior Senator from Kansas for his leader-
ship over the years and his attention to 
this bill. I also thank the chairman for 
holding a hearing and passing this im-
portant bill out of his committee. 
I know some of our colleagues have 
concerns about the museum location,

and I can assure them, Congress will 
have a voice in the site of the museum. 
Before construction can begin, congres-
sional committees will be consulted on 
site selection, as detailed in the bill. 
The Smithsonian board of regents, 
which will select the site, is chaired by 
Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts 
and comprises multiple members of 
Congress, including three sitting Sen-
ators, as well as the Vice President. 
Congress will also need to appro-
priate funds, a de facto ratification or 
rejection of the site selected by the 
Smithsonian board of regents. 
I intend there will be open lines of 
communication between members of 
Congress and the Smithsonian board of 
regents as they undertake this signifi-
cant project. 
It has been estimated if we pass this 
bill today, the doors to a new museum 
would not open for at least a decade 
and more likely not until 2034—so I am 
eager to get the process moving. 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate the work of my colleagues for 
raising the issue of the site of National 
Museum of the American Latino and 
for helping to find agreement. 
I thank Chairman BLUNT and Senator 
CORNYN for their commitment. I also 
thank many of our colleagues who 
helped us reach this solution today. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate will soon vote on the conference re-
port for the annual defense policy bill, 
known as the National Defense Author-
ization Act or NDAA. Like all con-
ference reports, this is a product of ne-
gotiations between the Senate and the 
House of Representatives. 
Producing a conference report takes 
dedicated negotiators who are willing 
to make tough compromises. I com-
mend them for their work, and I par-
ticularly want to thank my friend, 
Senator JACK REED, who has shown 
strong leadership as the ranking Demo-
crat on the Senate Armed Services 
Committee. 
I hope these negotiations will be a 
good omen for how Congress will work 
under the incoming Biden administra-
tion. 
But supporting the process that pro-
duced this conference report is very 
different from supporting the report on 
its merits. 
I have voted against the Senate 
version of this defense bill twice now, 
once during the rollcall vote in July 
and then during a voice vote last 
month. House negotiators have man-
aged to improve the bill since then, but 
not so significantly that I am able to 
support it now. 
I want to be clear that I support 
plenty of provisions in this NDAA. I 
even wrote or negotiated some of the 
language to improve the bill. 
The bill includes anti-money laun-
dering provisions, which I strongly sup-
port. I have twice introduced bipar-
tisan legislation to end the abuse of 
anonymous shell companies, and I am 
happy to see the NDAA expand upon 
my efforts. 
The conference report will also set in 
motion a 3-year process to remove Con-
federate names from military assets. I 
would 
have 
preferred 
a 
shorter 
timeline, but I am glad that Congress 
will be taking this overdue step to en-
sure that military bases do not honor 
traitors who fought to defend the hor-
rific institution of slavery. 
And the conference report also in-
cludes my amendments to push the 
Pentagon toward encrypting its com-
puters and to require the Army to pro-
vide a plan to finish cleaning up the 
former Umatilla Army Depot within 3 
years. 
But I cannot in good conscience au-
thorize $740 billion in military spend-
ing—including roughly $70 billion to 
continue the forever wars—while Sen-
ate Republicans are offering mere 
crumbs to help folks stay safe from a 
raging pandemic and help small busi-
nesses stay afloat during this unprece-
dented time. 
I said previously that I could not 
vote for a defense bill with Federal 
agents actively occupying Portland 
and treating peaceful protestors like 
foreign enemies. Donald Trump may 
have removed much of his occupying 
force but this bill does nothing to pre-
vent him or any future president from 
ordering similar abuses. 
And I have serious concerns about a 
provision that will permit the Sec-
retary of the Treasury or the Attorney 
General to issue subpoenas, with in-
definite gag orders, to foreign banks 
that maintain a correspondent account 
in the United States. 
There may be some limited instances 
where it may be appropriate to restrict 
bank employees from notifying ac-
count holders about a Federal sub-
poena to obtain their records, but as a 
general rule, I oppose indefinite gag or-
ders. I worry this section grants dan-
gerous powers to the executive branch 
to regulate speech, raising very serious 
First Amendment and due process con-
cerns. That is why gag orders should

every subpoena and should have an ex-

I regret that these and other flaws 
mean that I must continue to oppose 
this NDAA at this time. I yield the 
floor with the hope that Republicans 
will be as willing to provide real help 
for everyday Americans suffering—par-
ticularly during this tough holiday sea-
son—as they are to greenlight ever- 
higher levels of military spending.

RECOGNIZING THE WORLD FOOD 
PROGRAMME 
FOR 
RECEIVING 
THE 2020 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
to honor the United Nations World 
Food Programme, which is receiving 
the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize today. 
The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to 
those ‘‘who shall have done the most, 
or the best work, for fraternity be-
tween nations, for the abolition or re-
duction of standing armies and for the 
holding and promotion of peace con-
gresses.’’ 
The World Food Programme, WFP, 
the largest humanitarian organization 
focused on eliminating global hunger 
and increasing food security, truly em-
bodies those ideals. 
The organization was awarded the 
honor for ‘‘its efforts to combat hun-
ger, for its contribution to bettering 
conditions for peace in conflict-af-
fected areas, and for acting as a driving 
force in efforts to prevent the use of 
hunger as a weapon of war and con-
flict.’’ 
Those efforts, when put into num-
bers, show just what an enormous im-
pact WFP has as a last line of defense 
between hungry people and starvation. 
Each year, the organization provides 
more than 15 billion meals to 100 mil-
lion people in more than 80 countries. 
It was the world’s largest nongovern-
mental provider of school meals, reach-
ing 18 million children in 59 countries 
in last year. 
The logistical challenges of accom-
plishing this goal may seem over-
whelming to most but not to the WFP. 
The organization has it down to a 
science. WFP’s 18,000 staff has over 
5,000 trucks, 120 aircraft, and 20 ships 
on the move daily, bringing food to 
those who need it most. 
The WFP’s executive director, David 
Beasley, is a good friend of mine. His 
commitment to serving a higher call-
ing is inspirational. I couldn’t be more 
pleased that the spotlight is pointed on 
the work of the WFP under David’s 
dedicated leadership. 
David will be the first to tell you 
that despite this honor, the WFP’s 
work is far from complete. After the 
announcement, he said, ‘‘The good 
news is we’re feeding 80 million people 
on any given day in 80 countries. The 
bad news is it’s getting worse out 
there—the famine, the droughts, the 
conflicts.’’ 
While that assessment is spot-on, I 
would add one more factor to the list, 
the coronavirus pandemic. According 
to the WFP, the COVID–19 pandemic 
has the potential to double the number 
of people facing acute hunger to 270 
million people. It may also lead to 
emergence of famine in multiple coun-
tries. 
The pandemic makes the lifesaving 
work of the WFP all that much more 
vital. In a world where 60 percent of 
people suffering from chronic hunger 
live in countries affected by violence, 
additional 
nutritional 
access 
con-
straints only serve to make food a 
more powerful weapon of war. The 
WFP’s efforts to overcome that chal-
lenge and bring food to the hungry in 
conflict zones makes the organization 
well-deserved of the honor of a Nobel 
Peace Prize.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7419 
December 10, 2020 
Eliminating hunger at home and 
abroad takes an all-hands-on-deck ap-
proach. It requires leaders with vision-
ary solutions and supporting team 
members who are willing to put in the 
hard work to bring about meaningful 
change. David Beasley and his team at 
the WFP embody these principles. I 
congratulate them and offer my con-
tinued support as we work together to-
ward a world where hunger is no longer 
an issue.

TRIBUTE TO PAT ROBERTS 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, when 
his official portrait that will hang in 
the 
Senate 
Agriculture 
Committee 
hearing room was unveiled last month, 
Senator PAT ROBERTS said the panel he 
led so well ‘‘has a long history of car-
ing more about the issues than the ide-
ology, more about the people than the 
party.’’ 
Those words perfectly describe PAT’s 
philosophy of public service. Through-
out his four decades in Congress, this 
remarkable Kansan has always stood 
for government that is responsible to 
the taxpayers and responsive to the 
needs of the American people. He be-
lieves in a legislative process that is 
open, transparent, and bipartisan. 
PAT
retires with an extraordinary 
record of accomplishment. He is the 
first person in history to have served 
as chairman of the Agriculture Com-
mittees in both the House and the Sen-
ate. He is Kansas’ longest serving 
Member of Congress. As the ultimate 
evidence of the trust the people of his 
beloved State have in him, PAT has 
been on the ballot in 24 elections since 
1980 and has won every time. 
PAT and I were sworn in to the Sen-
ate on the same day in January of 1997. 
It has been an honor to serve alongside 
this national leader in agriculture, 
health care, and defense. He is an advo-
cate of a strong education system, free 
and fair trade policies, increased in-
vestment in science and technology, a 
focused foreign policy, and a strong 
military. 
This effective advocate for our Na-
tion’s family farms is a champion for 
rural America. A recent example is the 
State Offices of Rural Health Reau-
thorization Act he introduced and that 
I cosponsored. This law helps equip 
rural communities with the resources 
they need to strengthen their health 
care delivery systems and improve ac-
cess to high-quality services for indi-
viduals living in rural and underserved 
areas. 
From the U.S. Marine Corps to the 
U.S. Congress, PAT has served our Na-
tion with uncommon dedication. His 
wide-ranging 
accomplishments 
are 
united by a commitment to move 
America forward and empower the 
American people. I thank him for his 
service and his friendship and wish 
him, Frankie, and their family well in 
the years to come. 
TRIBUTE TO MARTHA McSALLY 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in her 
memoir titled ‘‘Dare to Fly’’, Senator 
Martha McSally tells an especially in-
spiring story from her Air Force days 
as the first American woman to fly in 
combat. This one anecdote reveals the 
totality of her character. 
In September 2005, a routine mission 
in the skies over Afghanistan suddenly 
turned into an emergency when a team 
of U.S. Special Forces were trapped in 
a canyon and under hostile fire. She 
raced to the scene only to discover that 
virtually all of the high-tech elec-
tronics for her A–10 Thunderbolt’s 
navigation and weapons systems had 
failed. 
She had a choice to make: Withdraw, 
wait for backup, and leave the troops 
in jeopardy, or continue the attack 
with her skill, determination, and 
courage replacing the malfunctioning 
technology. She made the choice that 
those of us who have had the honor of 
working with this great leader from 
Arizona have come to expect. 
The full title of Senator McSally’s 
memoir is ‘‘Dare to Fly: Simple Les-
sons in Never Giving Up.’’ From 26 
years in the U.S. Air Force, achieving 
the rank of full colonel and becoming 
not only the first woman to fly in com-
bat but also the first to command a 
fighter squadron, to two terms in the 
House of Representatives, to her serv-
ice in the Senate, she has done a lot in 
her remarkable life. Giving up is one 
thing she has never done. 
It has been a pleasure to work with 
Senator McSally on many issues, from 
increasing preventive care and treat-
ment for breast cancer to promoting 
animal welfare. As a champion for the 
men and women who serve our country 
in uniform, she led the way in creating 
a 
nationwide 
Veterans 
Treatment 
Court Program to provide our heroes 
with treatment they need to recover 
from the invisible wounds of war. 
Senator McSally has been a strong 
advocate for Arizona seniors and a 
dedicated and involved member of the 
Aging Committee, of which I serve as 
chairman. Together, we worked to pro-
tect older adults from criminals who 
sought to rob them of their hard- 
earned savings and introduced two sen-
ior fraud bills: the Anti-Spoofing Pen-
alties Modernization Act to combat un-
wanted robocalls and the Stamp Out 
Elder Abuse Act to support community 
efforts to prevent abuse, exploitation, 
and neglect. 
Senator McSally’s memoir contains 
another powerful story. When she was 
just 12 years old, her father was strick-
en by illness and had not long to live. 
He called his young daughter to his 
bedside and said this to her: ‘‘Make me 
proud.’’ 
That is another mission this Amer-
ican hero has carried out fully on be-
half of the people of Arizona and of our 
Nation. It makes me proud to have 
served with Senator Martha McSally, 
and I wish her all the best in the years 
to come. 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO SUSANA CORDOVA 
∑ Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to 
commend a great educator, Susana 
Cordova, for her service to Denver, our 
schools, and our children. As Susana 
steps down as superintendent of Denver 
Public Schools, it is the right time to 
say thank you and, more, to say how 
much we love and respect her for her 
dedication. She has done so much more 
than give 30 years to the Denver Public 
Schools. 
At every moment of her DPS career, 
Susana has been an educator’s educa-
tor—committed to each student, able 
to see their unique gifts and envision 
their individual success, and willing to 
meet them where they are so she could 
walk alongside them as they learned. 
She began as a teacher, first at Den-
ver’s Horace Mann Middle School and 
West High School. There, she taught 
language arts to students who mostly 
spoke Spanish at home. She became an 
assistant principal at Bryant-Webster 
Elementary School and then a prin-
cipal 
at 
Remington 
Elementary 
School, two more schools that served 
Spanish-speaking families. In her 4 
years at Remington, the school saw 
gains of 33 percent in reading. 
In 2002, she joined district leadership 
and again worked tirelessly to improve 
outcomes for students. Susana knew 
that the way to do this was to chal-
lenge students academically—to read 
the poem and write a clear argument 
about it, to think like a mathemati-
cian and show your work, to take 
courses that earned college credit or 
offered real workplace experience. Her 
approach placed high expectations on 
teachers and principals, not just stu-
dents. But because she had done the 
work herself, she was compassionate 
and always joined with her colleagues 
learning how to meet those expecta-
tions. 
In nearly all of these years, DPS im-
proved graduation, literacy, and math 
rates faster than the State of Colorado. 
Just as important, achievement gaps 
narrowed. Throughout Susana’s tenure 
as an instructional leader, DPS focused 
on improving the academic outcomes 
of students of color and students from 
families who qualify for free lunch. She 
would be the first to say that Denver, 
like other big-city school systems, has 
plenty of work left to do. There are 
still Denver children who might have 
even greater opportunity when they 
graduated if they were challenged to 
read ‘‘Bless Me, Ultima,’’ if they had a 
few more chances to learn how to bal-
ance a chemical equation, or if they 
graduated with a little college credit 
to help them along the way to earning 
a college degree. 
Susana’s commitment to DPS is 
more than professional. As a student, 
she attended kindergarten at Denver’s 
Barnum Elementary School. She went 
on to Kepner Middle School and grad-
uated from Abraham Lincoln High

School. She became the first in her 
family to go to college. Her roots in 
DPS span three generations. Her moth-
er, Rita Cordova, attended Denver’s 
Franklin 
and 
Greenlee 
elementary 
schools, Baker Junior High School, and 
West High School, before beginning a 
career as an office professional at Den-
ver’s Lake Junior High and then her 
alma mater, West. Both of Susana and 
Eric’s children, Alex and Carmen, are 
DPS graduates. 
Public education is one generation’s 
commitment of equity, freedom, and 
prosperity to the generation that fol-
lows. Susana’s story teaches us what 
happens 
when 
we 
follow 
through. 
Mothers and fathers pass the benefits 
forward to their daughters and sons. At 
a community meeting held before she 
was selected by the Denver Board of 
Education to become superintendent, 
she described the promise of public 
education like this: 
It gave me access and opportunity to a 
world that didn’t exist in my neighborhood. 
My mother grew up in Denver and went to 
the Denver public schools, as well. She didn’t 
have access to the kinds of classes I had ac-
cess to. It leveled the playing field for mi-
nority kids like me. 
Public education is not a promise 
that keeps itself. Susana’s career in 
DPS teaches us how much work is 
needed to make sure we don’t drop the 
ball. We keep the promise one student 
and one classroom at a time. It takes 
teachers, principals and district lead-
ers, families, and community members, 
each willing, like Susana, to do their 
part with the patience and diligence 
they would wish for their own child.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BILL RANEY 
∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise to 
recognize Bill Raney, a dedicated West 
Virginian, who is retiring after serving 
28 years as president and chief execu-
tive officer of the West Virginia Coal 
Association. 
Bill knows the value of coal—to our 
Appalachian communities, where it 
puts food on the table; to our State, 
where it provides tax revenues to pave 
our roads and fund our schools; and to 
our Nation, where it has helped power 
the greatest economic engine the world 
has ever known for more than a cen-
tury. He also appreciates the chal-
lenges and dangers inherent in pro-
ducing the black gold that creates all 
that well-being, starting his career 
working in public service to protect 
our miners. 
Starting in 1970, Bill—a graduate of 
his beloved West Virginia University— 
became familiarized with the coal in-
dustry working as a surface mine in-
spector for the West Virginia Depart-
ment of Natural Resources Division of 
Reclamation. In recognition of his 
service, he was later promoted to as-
sistant chief of that division. Moving 
to the private sector, Bill then served 
as vice president of the West Virginia 
Mining 
& 
Reclamation 
Association 
from 1977, until being named president 
of the West Virginia Coal Association 
in 1992. When the two organizations 
merged in 2000, he remained president 
of the newly formed organization, rep-
resenting the whole of West Virginia’s 
coal industry. 
Bill held these leadership positions 
serving the hard-working coal miners 
of West Virginia, while also serving his 
country in the West Virginia Army Na-
tional Guard. During his time with the 
Guard, he served in various leadership 
roles, including commander of the 
1092nd 
Combat 
Engineer 
Battalion, 
commander 
of 
the 
111th 
Engineer 
Group, and special assistant to the Ad-
jutant General at the rank of colonel. 
Following his personal service, Bill has 
continued advocating on behalf of our 
guardsmen as president of the West 
Virginia National Guard Association 
and chairman of the West Virginia Na-
tional Guard Foundation. 
Bill’s participation in civic organiza-
tions extends far beyond the military 
and the coal industry, as he has served 
as both chairman and as a current 
board member of the West Virginia 
Business & Industry Council; current 
board member of the West Virginia 
Youth Leadership Association’s Youth 
in Government Program, former chair-
man and current board member of the 
West Virginia Kids Count Fund; advi-
sory member of the West Virginia De-
partment of Environmental Protection 
Advisory Committee; member of the 
West Virginia University School of En-
gineering Mining Program Visiting 
Committee; as an elder at the First 
Presbyterian Church in Charleston; 
and volunteering his time with several 
other organizations. Bill has left an in-
delible legacy through his commitment 
to our State and our Nation’s military, 
impacts that will be felt throughout 
and beyond the coalfields. 
Bill Raney’s passion for the coal in-
dustry and the improvement of the 
State has earned him numerous honors 
and awards over the course of his dis-
tinguished career. This includes but is 
not limited to the Distinguished West 
Virginian Award, the WVU Alumni As-
sociation’s Most Loyal Alumni Award, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Asso-
ciation’s Hope Award, and the Lewis 
McManus Service Award given by the 
West Virginia Youth in Government 
Program. Mr. Raney has also been in-
ducted into the West Virginia Coal Hall 
of Fame and the First Tee Hall of 
Fame. 
It has been an honor to know and 
work with Bill during his distinguished 
tenure representing the coal industry 
and several esteemed civic organiza-
tions in West Virginia. He has been a 
great ally, resource, and friend to me 
over the years, and I will be forever 
grateful for his service. I wish him and 
his wife Pam many years of joy in this 
new phase of life. It is truly an honor 
to recognize and congratulate my 
friend Bill Raney on his well-deserved 
retirement.∑ 
TRIBUTE TO PETE SFERRAZZA 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
today I am honored to recognize former 
Reno mayor and justice of the peace 
for the Reno Justice Court, Pete 
Sferrazza, who retired in October of 
this year. 
Mr. Sferrazza has a long history of 
public service to the great State of Ne-
vada. He served as Reno’s mayor from 
1981 until 1995, an unprecedented length 
of service, and served as a judge on the 
Reno Justice Court from 2008 until his 
retirement earlier this year. In the in-
tervening years, Mr. Sferrazza served 
as county commissioner for Washoe 
County, from 1998 to 2007. 
During 
his 
time 
as 
mayor 
and 
throughout his life of public service, 
Mr. Sferrazza focused on advancing 
labor rights and economic prosperity, 
while promoting the beauty of the 
Reno community. As mayor, he led the 
establishment of the City of Reno Arts 
Commission, as well as the creation of 
Reno’s 
Victim 
Advocate 
Program, 
which has served as a model for the 
rest of the State. Mr. Sferrazza was 
also responsible for helping to preserve 
the Mt. Rose Wilderness and sup-
porting the iconic Truckee River Walk. 
In a time of seemingly stark political 
divide, Mr. Sferrazza is a shining exam-
ple of what an elected official can and 
should be. As county commissioner, he 
approved a number of expansions of 
Reno’s downtown and helped to con-
solidate various local emergency serv-
ices, increasing efficiency and reducing 
costs. Finally, during his time on the 
Reno Justice Court, Mr. Sferrazza was 
elected by his colleagues as president 
of the American Judges Association, 
the largest judges’ association in the 
United States. His willingness and de-
sire to help everyone in his community 
have been crucial to the city’s develop-
ment, especially as the city continues 
to grow into the 21st century. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing Mr. Pete Sferrazza as he re-
tires after decades of serving the city 
of Reno, Washoe County, and the State 
of Nevada in so many ways. His time in 
public office has made the Reno-Sparks 
community stronger and more inclu-
sive for everyone, and I want to thank 
him for his service and lifelong com-
mitment to leaving the Truckee Mead-
ows a better place than he found it. ∑

RECOGNIZING LA CABANITA MEX 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize 
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today I am pleased to 
honor La Cabanita Mex in Ketchum as 
the Idaho Small Business of the Month 
for December 2020. 
Growing up, Rodolfo Armenta was 
captivated by his father’s cooking and 
passion for traditional Mexican cui-
sine. Rodolfo knew he wanted serve his 
father’s food as a career and dreamed 
of one day opening up his own Mexican 
restaurant. 
During a visit to Idaho’s Wood River 
Valley, Rodolfo fell in love with the 
area’s natural beauty and tight-knit 
community and soon relocated his fam-
ily to the area. After years of hard 
work 
and 
determination, 
Rodolfo 
opened La Cabanita in Ketchum where 
it continues to thrive today. 
Since its 2009 opening, La Cabanita 
has become a beloved institution, gar-
nering accolades for its exceptional 
food, family atmosphere, and dedicated 
service to the community. It has re-
ceived multiple awards, including the 
gold medal for ‘‘Best Mexican Res-
taurant’’ 
in 
the 
Idaho 
Mountain 
Express’s Best of Valley Survey for 5 
years in a row, and continues to draw 
in locals and tourists alike. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
Ketchum location, Rodolfo opened a 
second La Cabanita in Bellevue and a 
bakery in the Wood River Valley, pro-
viding dozens of jobs to the local com-
munity and giving Idahoans a true 
sense of the cultural vibrance that sur-
rounds Mexican cuisine. 
Congratulations to Rodolfo, his fam-
ily, and all of the employees of La 
Cabanita Mex on being selected as the 
Idaho Small Business of the Month for 
December 2020. You make our great 
State proud, and I look forward to your 
continued growth and success.∑

aged 16 and older in the United States drove 
under the influence of cocaine (including 
crack), 
heroin, 
hallucinogens, 
inhalants, 
methamphetamine, or marijuana, which is 
an 8 percent increase compared to 2018; 
Whereas the Insurance Institute for High-
way Safety found that new technologies that 
prevent alcohol-impaired drivers from oper-
ating vehicles can save 9,000 lives per year 
and that driver assistance systems, which 
help prevent human errors on the road, can 
potentially reduce the number of crashes and 
their severity; 
Whereas, according to Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving, the use of ignition interlock 
devices prevented more than 3,000,000 at-
tempts of alcohol-impaired driving between 
2006 and 2018; and 
Whereas the National Transportation Safe-
ty Board included ending alcohol and other 
drug-impaired driving on its Most Wanted 
List of Transportation Safety Improvements 
for 2019–2020: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commends the efforts of law enforce-
ment agencies and officers to enforce im-
paired driving laws; 
(2) supports national and State high visi-
bility enforcement campaigns, such as Drive 
Sober or Get Pulled Over; 
(3) recognizes the need for greater research 
on how drugs affect and, in some cases, im-
pair an individual’s ability to operate a 
motor vehicle; 
(4) recognizes that technological solutions 
have the potential to save thousands of lives 
each year; 
(5) supports programs to better collect 
data on impaired driving, including data on 
illicit drug use by drivers; 
(6) supports programs to train law enforce-
ment officials on detecting and stopping im-
paired driving; and 
(7) designates December 2020 as ‘‘National 
Impaired Driving Prevention Month’’.

SA 
2700. 
Mr. CORNYN (for Mr. 
WICKER (for himself and Mr. CARDIN)) 
proposed an amendment to the bill S. 
1310, to strengthen participation of 
elected national legislators in the ac-
tivities of the Organization of Amer-
ican States and reaffirm United States 
support for Organization of American 
States human rights and anti-corrup-
tion initiatives, and for other purposes; 
as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Organiza-
tion of American States Legislative Engage-
ment Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The Charter of the Organization of 
American States establishes that ‘‘represent-
ative democracy is an indispensable condi-
tion for the stability, peace and development 
of the region’’. 
(2) Article 2 of the Inter-American Demo-
cratic Charter of the Organization of Amer-
ican States affirms that ‘‘the effective exer-
cise of representative democracy is the basis 
for the rule of law and of the constitutional 
regimes of the member states of the Organi-
zation of American States’’. 
(3) Article 26 of the Inter-American Demo-
cratic Charter states that ‘‘the OAS will con-
tinue to carry out programs and activities 
designed to promote democratic principles 
and practices and strengthen a democratic 
culture in the Hemisphere’’. 
(4) In accordance with the OAS Charter 
and the Inter-American Democratic Charter, 
the OAS General Assembly, OAS Permanent 
Council, and OAS Secretariat have estab-
lished a wide range of cooperative agree-
ments with domestic and international orga-
nizations, including national legislative in-
stitutions. 
(5) In 2004, OAS General Assembly Resolu-
tion 2044 (XXXIV–O/04) appealed for the 
‘‘strengthening of legislatures, as well as 
inter-parliamentary 
cooperation 
on 
key 
items of the inter-American agenda, with a 
view, in particular, to generating initiatives 
to fight corruption, poverty, inequality, and 
social exclusion’’. 
(6) In 2005, OAS General Assembly Resolu-
tion 2095 (XXXV–O/05) called on the OAS Sec-
retariat to ‘‘invite [. . .] the presidents or 
speakers of the national legislative institu-
tions of the Americas, i.e., congresses, par-
liaments, or national assemblies, [. . .] to at-
tend a special meeting of the Permanent 
Council [. . .] for the initiation of a dialogue 
on topics on the hemispheric agenda’’.

legislators from OAS member states by con-
vening two meetings of presidents of na-
tional legislatures, first in Lima, Peru and 
subsequently in Santiago, Chile. 
(8) However, no permanent procedures 
exist to facilitate the participation of elect-
ed national legislators from OAS member 
states in OAS activities. 
(9) The Organization for Security and Co- 
operation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary 
Assembly has proven successful at strength-
ening 
inter-parliamentary 
cooperation 
among its member states. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is that sense of Congress that— 
(1) elected national legislators play an es-
sential role in the exercise of representative 
democracy in the Americas, including by— 
(A) promoting economic freedom and re-
spect for property rights; 
(B) promoting the rule of law and com-
bating corruption; 
(C) defending human rights and funda-
mental freedoms; and 
(D) advancing the principles and practices 
expressed in the Charter of the Organization 
of American States, the American Declara-
tion on the Rights and Duties of Man, and 
the Inter-American Democratic Charter; 
(2) establishing procedures and mecha-
nisms to facilitate the participation of elect-
ed national legislators from OAS member 
states in OAS activities could contribute to 
the promotion of democratic principles and 
practices and strengthen a democratic cul-
ture in the Western Hemisphere; 
(3) increasing and strengthening the par-
ticipation of elected national legislators 
from OAS member states in OAS activities 
could advance the principles and proposals 
expressed in section 4 of the Organization of 
American States Revitalization and Reform 
Act of 2013 (Public Law 113–41; 127 Stat. 549); 
(4) the OAS General Assembly, OAS Per-
manent Council, and OAS Secretariat should 
take steps to facilitate greater participation 
of elected national legislators from OAS 
member states in OAS activities; 
(5) the OAS Permanent Council resolutions 
titled ‘‘Guidelines for the Participation of 
Civil Society in OAS Activities’’ and ‘‘Strat-
egies for Increasing and Strengthening Par-
ticipation by Civil Society Organizations in 
OAS Activities’’ should serve as important 
references for efforts to bolster the partici-
pation of elected national legislators from 
OAS member states in OAS activities; and 
(6) the successful experience of the Organi-
zation for Security and Co-operation in Eu-
rope Parliamentary Assembly should serve 
as a model to the OAS in creating a similar 
mechanism. 
SEC. 4. STRENGTHENING PARTICIPATION OF 
ELECTED NATIONAL LEGISLATORS 
AT THE OAS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of State, 
acting through the United States Mission to 
the Organization of American States, should 
use the voice and vote of the United States 
to support the creation of procedures for the 
Organization of American States that— 
(1) enhance the participation of democrat-
ically elected national legislators from OAS 
member state countries in OAS activities 
that advance the principles of the Inter- 
American Democratic Charter and the core 
values of the OAS consistent with the prin-
ciples and proposals expressed in section 4 of 
the Organization of American States Revi-
talization and Reform Act of 2013 (Public 
Law 113–41; 127 Stat. 549); 
(2) create an annual forum for democrat-
ically elected national legislatures from OAS 
member states to discuss issues of hemi-
spheric importance, including regional ef-
forts to defend human rights and combat 
transnational criminal activities, corrup-
tion, and impunity; 
(3) permit elected national legislators from 
OAS member states to make presentations, 
contribute information, and provide expert 
advice, as appropriate, to the OAS Secre-
tariat, OAS Permanent Council, and OAS 
General Assembly about OAS activities on 
issues of hemispheric importance; 
(4) lead to the creation of a mechanism to 
regularly facilitate the participation of 
elected national legislators in OAS activi-
ties; and 
(5) reinforce OAS Secretariat programs 
that provide technical assistance for the 
modernization and institutional strength-
ening of national legislatures from OAS 
member states. 
(b) EXPENSES.—The Secretary of State, 
acting through the United States Mission to 
the Organization of American States, as ap-
propriate, shall seek to ensure that expenses 
related to the procedures set forth in this 
Act do not increase member quotas, assessed 
fees, or voluntary contributions and that the 
Secretariat of the OAS shall seek to ensure 
shared financial responsibilities among the 
member states in facilitating the financial 
support necessary to carry out this initia-
tive. 
SEC. 5. SUPPORT FOR OAS HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
ANTI-CORRUPTION INITIATIVES. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the efforts of the OAS Secretary Gen-
eral and Secretariat to combat corruption 
and impunity in the Americas represent im-
portant contributions to strengthening the 
rule of law and democratic governance in the 
Americas; and 
(2) the United States should support efforts 
to ensure the effectiveness and independence 
of OAS initiatives to combat corruption and 
impunity in the Americas.

AND
HUMAN
RIGHTS 
PROMOTION STRATEGY.—Not later than 180 
days after the date of the enactment of the 
Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the 
Senate and the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs of the House of Representatives a strat-
egy for supporting OAS anti-corruption and 
human rights promotion efforts. The strat-
egy should include— 
(1) an assessment of United States pro-
grams, activities, and initiatives with the 
OAS to support anti-corruption and human 
rights promotion in the Americas; 
(2) a summary of the steps taken by the 
United States Mission to the OAS to 
strengthen anti-corruption and anti-impu-
nity efforts in the Americas; 
(3) an assessment of necessary reforms and 
initiatives to prioritize and reinforce the 
OAS Secretary General and Secretariat’s ef-
forts to advance human rights and combat 
corruption and impunity in the Americas; 
(4) a detailed plan to facilitate increased 
OAS collaboration, as appropriate, with rel-
evant stakeholders, including elected na-
tional legislators and civil society, in sup-
port of an approach to promote human rights 
and combat transnational criminal activi-
ties, corruption, and impunity in the Amer-
icas; and 
(5) a detailed plan for implementing the 
strategy set forth in this section of the Act. 
SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of State shall submit to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations of the Sen-
ate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of 
the House of Representatives a report on 
OAS processes, initiatives, and reforms un-
dertaken to implement section 4, actions 
taken to implement the strategy required 
under section 5(b), and steps taken to imple-
ment the Organization of American States 
Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 (Pub-
lic Law 113–41). The report should include— 
(1) an analysis of the progress made by the 
OAS to adopt and effectively implement re-
forms and initiatives to advance human 
rights and combat corruption and impunity 
in the Americas; and 
(2) a detailed assessment of OAS efforts to 
increase stakeholder engagement to advance 
human rights and combat corruption and im-
punity in the Americas.

port required under subsection (a), and annu-
ally thereafter for two additional years, the 
Secretary shall provide to the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate and the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House 
of Representatives a briefing on the informa-
tion required to be included in such report. 
SEC. 7. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ELECTED NA-
TIONAL LEGISLATOR. 
It is the sense of Congress that an elected 
national legislator participating in the ac-
tivities outlined in this Act should be an in-
dividual that— 
(1) was elected as a result of periodic, free 
and fair elections; and 
(2) is not known to be under investigation 
or convicted for corruption or transnational 
criminal activities, including trafficking of 
people, goods, or illicit narcotics, money-

‘‘(A) apply such paragraph by substituting 
‘2018’ for ‘2019’, and

turn for such individual’s first taxable year 
beginning in 2018, use information with re-

SA 2702. Ms. MURKOWSKI (for Mr. 
MORAN) proposed an amendment to the 
bill S. 633, to award a Congressional 
Gold Medal to the members of the 
Women’s Army Corps who were as-
signed to the 6888th Central Postal Di-
rectory Battalion, known as the ‘‘Six 
Triple Eight’’; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘ ‘Six Triple 
Eight’ Congressional Gold Medal Act of 
2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On July 1, 1943, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt signed into law legislation that es-
tablished the Women’s Army Corps (referred 
to in this section as the ‘‘WAC’’) as a compo-
nent in the Army. The WAC was converted 
from the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘WAAC’’), 
which had been created in 1942 without offi-
cial military status. First Lady Eleanor Roo-
sevelt and Mary McLeod Bethune, the found-
er of the National Council of Negro Women, 
advocated for the admittance of African- 
American women into the newly formed 
WAC to serve as officers and enlisted per-
sonnel. 
(2) Dubbed ‘‘10 percenters’’, the recruit-
ment of African-American women to the 
WAAC was limited to 10 percent of the popu-
lation of the WAAC to match the proportion 
of African-Americans in the national popu-
lation. Despite an executive order issued by 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 ban-
ning racial discrimination in civilian defense 
industries, the Armed Forces remained seg-
regated. Enlisted women served in seg-
regated units, participated in segregated 
training, lived in separate quarters, ate at 
separate tables in mess halls, and used seg-
regated recreational facilities. Officers re-
ceived their officer candidate training in in-
tegrated units but lived under segregated 
conditions. Specialist and technical training 
schools were integrated in 1943. During 
World War II, a total of 6,520 African-Amer-
ican women served in the WAAC and the 
WAC. 
(3) After several units of White women 
were sent to serve in the European Theater 
of Operations (referred to in this section as 
the ‘‘ETO’’) during World War II, African- 
American organizations advocated for the 
War Department to extend the opportunity 
to serve overseas to African-American WAC 
units. 
(4) In November 1944, the War Department 
approved sending African-American women 
to serve in Europe. A battalion of all Afri-
can-American women drawn from the WAC, 
the Army Service Forces, and the Army Air 
Forces was created and designated as the 
6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion 
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘6888th’’), 
which 
was 
nicknamed 
the 
‘‘Six 
Triple 
Eight’’. 
(5) Army officials reported a shortage of 
qualified postal officers within the ETO, 
which resulted in a backlog of undelivered 
mail. As Allied forces drove across Europe,

the 
ever-changing 
locations 
of 
servicemembers hampered the delivery of 
mail 
to 
those 
servicemembers. 
Because 
7,000,000 individuals from the United States 
were serving in the ETO, many of those indi-
viduals had identical names. As an example, 
7,500 such individuals were named Robert 
Smith. One general predicted that the back-
log in Birmingham, England would take 6 
months to process and the lack of reliable 
mail service was hurting morale. 
(6) In March 1945, the 6888th arrived in Bir-
mingham. Upon their arrival, the 6888th 
found warehouses filled with millions of 
pieces of mail intended for members of the 
Armed Forces, United States Government 
personnel, and Red Cross workers serving in 
the ETO. 
(7) The 6888th created effective processes 
and filing systems to track individual 
servicemembers, organize ‘‘undeliverable’’ 
mail, determine the intended recipient for 
insufficiently addressed mail, and handle 
mail addressed to servicemembers who had 
died. Adhering to their motto of ‘‘No mail, 
low morale’’, the women processed an aver-
age of 65,000 pieces of mail per shift and 
cleared the 6-month backlog of mail within 3 
months. 
(8) The 6888th traveled to Rouen, France in 
May 1945 and worked through a separate 
backlog of undelivered mail dating back as 
far as 3 years. 
(9) At the completion of their mission, the 
entire unit returned to the United States. 
The 6888th was discontinued on March 9, 1946, 
at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. 
(10) The accomplishments of the 6888th in 
Europe 
encouraged 
the 
General 
Board, 
United States Forces, European Theater of 
Operations to adopt the following premise in 
their study of the WAC issued in December 
1945: ‘‘[T]he national security program is the 
joint responsibility of all Americans irre-
spective of color or sex’’ and ‘‘the continued 
use of colored, along with white, female mili-
tary personnel is required in such strength 
as is proportionately appropriate to the rel-
ative population distribution between col-
ored and white races’’. 
(11) With the exception of smaller units of 
African-American nurses who served in Afri-
ca, Australia, and England, the 6888th was 
the only African-American women’s unit to 
serve overseas during World War II. 
(12) The members of the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ 
received the European African Middle East-
ern Campaign Medal, the Women’s Army 
Corps Service Medal, and the World War II

SA 2703. Ms. MURKOWSKI (for Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND) proposed an amendment 
to the bill H.R. 1925, to designate the 
Manhattan Campus of the New York 
Harbor Health Care System of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs as the 
‘‘Margaret Cochran Corbin Campus of 
the New York Harbor Health Care Sys-
tem’’; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF MANHATTAN CAM-
PUS OF THE NEW YORK HARBOR 
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OF THE DE-
PARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS, 
NEW YORK. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Margaret Cochran was born in Franklin 
County, Pennsylvania, on November 12, 1751, 
and married John Corbin in 1772. 
(2) Three years after the marriage, when 
John Corbin left to fight in the Revolu-
tionary War as an artilleryman, Margaret 
Corbin accompanied him to war to support 
the Revolutionary Army. 
(3) Margaret Corbin supported the Revolu-
tionary Army by caring for injured and sick 
soldiers as well as by cooking and cleaning. 
During battle, she also helped her husband 
load the cannon he was responsible for man-
ning. 
(4) On November 16, 1776, John Corbin was 
manning a cannon during the Battle of Fort 
Washington on Manhattan Island, New York, 
when he was killed. Margaret Corbin hero-
ically took her husband’s place, firing the 
cannon until she, too, was hit by enemy fire 
and seriously wounded. 
(5) Having lost the use of her left arm, 
Margaret Corbin was assigned to the ‘‘In-
valid Regiment’’ at West Point, New York. 
(6) The Continental Congress awarded Mar-
garet Corbin a lifelong pension for her inju-
ries, making her the first woman to receive 
a pension from the United States by virtue 
of military service for the United States. 
(7) Margaret Corbin died in 1789 in High-
land Falls, New York. She is honored nearby 
at West Point as a hero of the Revolutionary 
War. 
(b) DESIGNATION.—The Manhattan Campus 
of the New York Harbor Health Care System 
of the Department of Veterans Affairs in 
New York, New York, shall after the date of 
the enactment of this Act be known and des-
ignated as the ‘‘Margaret Cochran Corbin 
Campus of the New York Harbor Health Care 
System’’ or the ‘‘Margaret Cochran Corbin 
VA Campus’’. 
(c) REFERENCE.—Any reference in any law, 
regulation, map, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the Campus 
referred to in subsection (b) shall be deemed 
to be a reference to the Margaret Cochran

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

The amendment (No. 2702) was agreed 
to, as follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘ ‘Six Triple 
Eight’ Congressional Gold Medal Act of 
2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On July 1, 1943, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt signed into law legislation that es-
tablished the Women’s Army Corps (referred 
to in this section as the ‘‘WAC’’) as a compo-
nent in the Army. The WAC was converted 
from the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘WAAC’’), 
which had been created in 1942 without offi-
cial military status. First Lady Eleanor Roo-
sevelt and Mary McLeod Bethune, the found-
er of the National Council of Negro Women, 
advocated for the admittance of African- 
American women into the newly formed 
WAC to serve as officers and enlisted per-
sonnel. 
(2) Dubbed ‘‘10 percenters’’, the recruit-
ment of African-American women to the 
WAAC was limited to 10 percent of the popu-
lation of the WAAC to match the proportion 
of African-Americans in the national popu-
lation. Despite an executive order issued by 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 ban-
ning racial discrimination in civilian defense 
industries, the Armed Forces remained seg-
regated. Enlisted women served in seg-
regated units, participated in segregated 
training, lived in separate quarters, ate at 
separate tables in mess halls, and used seg-
regated recreational facilities. Officers re-
ceived their officer candidate training in in-
tegrated units but lived under segregated 
conditions. Specialist and technical training 
schools were integrated in 1943. During 
World War II, a total of 6,520 African-Amer-
ican women served in the WAAC and the 
WAC. 
(3) After several units of White women 
were sent to serve in the European Theater 
of Operations (referred to in this section as 
the ‘‘ETO’’) during World War II, African- 
American organizations advocated for the 
War Department to extend the opportunity 
to serve overseas to African-American WAC 
units. 
(4) In November 1944, the War Department 
approved sending African-American women 
to serve in Europe. A battalion of all Afri-
can-American women drawn from the WAC, 
the Army Service Forces, and the Army Air 
Forces was created and designated as the 
6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion 
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘6888th’’), 
which 
was 
nicknamed 
the 
‘‘Six 
Triple 
Eight’’. 
(5) Army officials reported a shortage of 
qualified postal officers within the ETO, 
which resulted in a backlog of undelivered 
mail. As Allied forces drove across Europe, 
the 
ever-changing 
locations 
of 
servicemembers hampered the delivery of 
mail 
to 
those 
servicemembers. 
Because 
7,000,000 individuals from the United States 
were serving in the ETO, many of those indi-
viduals had identical names. As an example, 
7,500 such individuals were named Robert 
Smith. One general predicted that the back-
log in Birmingham, England would take 6 
months to process and the lack of reliable 
mail service was hurting morale. 
(6) In March 1945, the 6888th arrived in Bir-
mingham. Upon their arrival, the 6888th 
found warehouses filled with millions of 
pieces of mail intended for members of the 
Armed Forces, United States Government 
personnel, and Red Cross workers serving in 
the ETO. 
(7) The 6888th created effective processes 
and filing systems to track individual 
servicemembers, organize ‘‘undeliverable’’ 
mail, determine the intended recipient for 
insufficiently addressed mail, and handle 
mail addressed to servicemembers who had 
died. Adhering to their motto of ‘‘No mail, 
low morale’’, the women processed an aver-
age of 65,000 pieces of mail per shift and 
cleared the 6-month backlog of mail within 3 
months. 
(8) The 6888th traveled to Rouen, France in 
May 1945 and worked through a separate 
backlog of undelivered mail dating back as 
far as 3 years. 
(9) At the completion of their mission, the 
entire unit returned to the United States. 
The 6888th was discontinued on March 9, 1946, 
at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. 
(10) The accomplishments of the 6888th in 
Europe 
encouraged 
the 
General 
Board, 
United States Forces, European Theater of 
Operations to adopt the following premise in 
their study of the WAC issued in December 
1945: ‘‘[T]he national security program is the 
joint responsibility of all Americans irre-
spective of color or sex’’ and ‘‘the continued 
use of colored, along with white, female mili-
tary personnel is required in such strength 
as is proportionately appropriate to the rel-
ative population distribution between col-
ored and white races’’. 
(11) With the exception of smaller units of 
African-American nurses who served in Afri-
ca, Australia, and England, the 6888th was 
the only African-American women’s unit to 
serve overseas during World War II. 
(12) The members of the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ 
received the European African Middle East-
ern Campaign Medal, the Women’s Army 
Corps Service Medal, and the World War II 
Victory Medal for their service. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make

(1) IN
GENERAL.—After the award of the 
gold medal under subsection (a), the medal 
shall be given to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, where the medal shall be available for 
display, as appropriate, and made available

(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Smithsonian Institution 
should make the gold medal received under 
paragraph (1) available elsewhere, particu-
larly at— 
(A) appropriate locations associated with 
the 6888th Central Postal Directory Bat-
talion; 
(B) the Women in Military Service for 
America Memorial; 
(C) the United States Army Women’s Mu-
seum; 
(D) the National World War II Museum and

(E) any other location determined appro-
priate by the Smithsonian Institution. 
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
Under such regulations as the Secretary 
may prescribe, the Secretary may strike and 
sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal 
struck under section 3 at a price sufficient to 
cover the costs of the medals, including 
labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and 
overhead expenses.

HONORING SUPERVISOR ROB 
BROWN 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Supervisor Rob 
Brown for more than 20 years of dedicated 
public service in Lake County on the occasion 
of his retirement. In his five terms as County 
Supervisor, he has displayed a practical, sen-
sible approach to leadership that has en-
deared him to his colleagues and constituents. 
A Lake County native, Supervisor Brown 
has made it his mission to address the most 
important issues facing his life-long home. In 
response to the devastating 2015 Valley Fire, 
he stepped up to lead the county’s response 
and recovery efforts and personally oversaw 
the evacuation of Clearlake Riviera when law 
enforcement was overstrained. Never a man 
to leave things unfinished, he spearheaded 
extended land management assistance under 
the Benefit Zone initiative and brought volun-
teers together under the ‘‘1,000 Hands 
Project’’ to mitigate future wildfire risks. When 
the Coronavirus pandemic threatened lives 
and livelihoods, he once again rose to the 
challenge, developing plans to distribute more 
than $1 million in CARES Act funding to busi-
nesses in need. 
Even in more certain times, Supervisor 
Brown never became complacent, tirelessly 
pursuing projects to benefit his constituents. 
He was instrumental in securing private fund-
ing for the construction of the Children’s Multi- 
Disciplinary Interview Center for the District At-
torney’s Office, which has gained recognition 
as a powerful tool to improve child welfare. Al-
ways attuned to the need to preserve our nat-
ural and historic heritage, he led the acquisi-
tion of Mt. Konocti as a County Park and the 
establishment of the Ely Stage Stop Agricul-
tural Museum. Even while working diligently to 
accomplish these goals, Supervisor Brown 
made a name for himself as a uniquely hu-
morous, compassionate community member, 
partner, father, and grandfather. 
Madam Speaker, Supervisor Rob Brown 
has distinguished himself as a civic leader 
with integrity, intellect, and savvy. It is there-
fore fitting and proper that we honor him here 
today.

RECOGNIZING LESLIE LOVE 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the lasting impact of the work of 
Michigan State Representative Leslie Love as 
she enters into retirement. 
Over the years, I have witnessed Rep-
resentative Love’s hard work and commitment 
to the people she serves in Michigan’s Tenth 
House District. Rep. Love was born, raised, 
and educated in the City of Detroit and her 
community roots run deep. She is passionate 
in her approach to securing resources for the 
residents of Redford Township and the City of 
Detroit. As a legislator, she counts among her 
successes, securing financial resources that 
provide much-needed technology to public 
schools, public parks, and after school pro-
gramming for young people. Rep. Love has 
also championed auto insurance reform, a pol-
icy that would have a profound impact on resi-
dents. Further cementing her commitment to 
public service, Rep. Love has connected with 
residents throughout the Tenth House District 
on countless occasions, whether it’s attending 
community events or hosting town halls or cof-
fee hours. 
In short, Representative Leslie Love has 
served the public admirably. Please join me in 
tribute to her service.

HONORING THE VOLUNTEERS OF 
THE IOWA MASK BRIGADE 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, as millions of 
individuals, families, and essential workers 
struggle to obtain the proper personal protec-
tive equipment (PPE) required to keep them 
safe during these difficult times, volunteer or-
ganizations like the Iowa Mask Brigade have 
stepped up to provide these critical items to 
keep our citizens and communities safe. That 
is why today, I rise to ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing the Iowa 
Mask Brigade as this week’s Iowan of the 
Week. 
The Iowa Mask Brigade was founded earlier 
this year by Connie Klug after she received a 
distressed call from her niece, an emergency 
room doctor in desperate need of PPE. 
Connie immediately got to work researching 
protective masks and found that filters were 
the most important feature that made them ef-
fective. Although commercial face mask filters 
were not available, Connie used her problem- 
solving skills to create her own. She began 
cutting furnace filters from the company 3M, 
the same company that produces the coveted 
N95 masks. Sandwiching this filter in between 
two layers of high-quality cotton fabric, Connie 
produced her first mask in a process the New 
York Times would later consider the best 
method of making homemade masks. Connie, 
a quilter, enlisted the help of two of her seam-
stress friends, who enlisted the help of their 
friends, and an organization instantly formed 
as volunteers coalesced around one simple 
idea: to provide masks to those who need 
them. 
In their first month of operation, the Iowa 
Mask Brigade used over 75 furnace filters. 
Today, the Iowa Mask Brigade consists of 35 
volunteers who have collectively produced al-
most 8,000 masks since its inception in 
March. 
One of those volunteers is Ray Getting, who 
handles much of the logistics within the Bri-
gade. In a recent conversation, he mentioned 
everyone who has received a mask is so in-
credibly appreciative. The group maintains ex-
tremely high standards for quality, and if a 
mask wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t sent out. He’s 
been able to send high quality masks to peo-
ple he cares about in places he knows it’s 
going to make a difference. 
As the organization has grown, their mask- 
making has become more innovative. When 
the Brigade ran out of elastic bands for ear 
loops, they turned to hairbands. Today, they 
have purchased over 25,000 hairbands for 
their masks, and they have shared this tech-
nique, as well as many others they have de-
veloped, with other mask-making organiza-
tions. 
The Iowa Mask Brigade has sent masks to 
people in need all over the United States. 
From the Iowa’s Dallas County Hospital to 
San Antonio to the Navajo Nation in Arizona, 
for whom they have created a custom design 
to fit their preferences. Now, the Brigade 
mostly serves low income housing, hospitals, 
and nursing homes, such as the APEHA sen-
ior living apartments in Johnston, Iowa. 
In honoring the Iowa Mask Brigade today, I 
want to underscore the values of hard work, 
dedication, persistence, and problem-solving 
that Iowans demonstrate in spades during this 
difficult time. As Connie Klug said, ‘‘A unique 
characteristic of Iowans is that we don’t get 
defeated easily. We just went to work and 
overcame it. That to me is Iowans: we don’t 
get discouraged; we just get to work. We’re 
not helpless. We rolled up our sleeves and 
said, there are not problems that we can’t fig-
ure out.’’ 
I am so proud to recognize the Iowa Mask 
Brigade for their outstanding work and their 
unwavering willingness to help all those in 
need. It is my hope that other individuals and 
organizations are inspired to take action of 
their own. The volunteers powering the Iowa 
Mask Brigade have not only given protective 
gear to people in need, but also instilled hope 
when we need it most. It is my honor to share 
the Iowa Mask Brigade’s story and recognize 
the group as our Iowan of the Week.

Ramı´rez de Ceballos. She attended Colegio 
Ame´rica Elementary School in Nuevo Laredo 
before attending St. Augustine High School in 
Laredo, TX, where she was class valedic-
torian. She would soon earn an Associate of 
Arts Degree from Laredo Junior College and 
then a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Spanish 
and History from Texas A&I University- 
Kingsville. Years later, she would continue her 
studies at Laredo State University where she 
earned a Master of Science in Secondary 
Education and Spanish. 
In 1969, Rosa joined the Laredo Inde-
pendent School District, where she taught for 
39 years. Over the course of her time at La-
redo ISD, she was known as an outstanding 
teacher and an inspiring person. She was an 
individual who dedicated her time to ensuring 
that her students gained an enriching edu-
cation while always pushing them to challenge 
themselves with new experiences. For exam-
ple, she sponsored study abroad trips to 
Spain, hosted oral Spanish poetry and prose 
contests, and created a Mother’s Day program 
of original poetry and prose compositions. She 
would also have her students present their po-
etry to dignitaries honored at the annual 
LULAC Senor Internacional. In addition to her 
work at Laredo ISD, she also served as an 
Adjunct Spanish Professor at Texas A&M 
International University for several years. She 
was also a Hispanic Studies PhD Candidate at 
Texas A&M University-College Station, where 
she passed all oral and written exams. 
Rosa is also a renowned artist, Her poetry 
has given a strong and distinct voice to those 
in the border community. She understands the 
unique experience of Laredoans and brings 
that familiarity to a larger audience. I appre-
ciate her work and the guidance she has 
given to countless students. Her work in the 
field of education is both moving and a re-
minder of how many lives can be touched by 
just one individual. 
For her work, she has received numerous 
awards, including: Laredo Morning Times 
Woman of the Month, Cigarroa High School 
Teacher of the Year and the Raı´ces Award, 
Webb County Heritage Foundation Traditions

Madam Speaker, I congratulate Rosa Maria 
Ceballos de Llano on this prestigious recogni-
tion and I wish her the best moving forward.

HONORING KARRIE PARDIECK 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
give thanks to a dedicated public servant who 
has for two decades served the people of 
eastern Indiana with great care and devotion. 
As she now retires with twenty years of 
service, I want to offer my wholehearted 
thanks to Karrie Pardieck for all that she has 
done for me, my predecessors and for Hoo-
siers across eastern Indiana. 
Karrie Pardieck was first hired by my broth-
er, Vice President MIKE PENCE, when he was 
elected to what was then the Second Con-
gressional District of Indiana. As the Second 
became the Sixth, Karrie earned a reputation 
of putting Hoosier constituents first. 
My staff knows that we have no higher pri-
ority than constituent services, and Karrie has 
been on the front lines of ensuring that Hoo-
siers were taken care of and their voices were 
being heard. 
Undoubtedly Karrie has handled many thou-
sands of cases in her area of expertise. In just 
the last two years alone, Karrie opened fed-
eral inquiries on behalf of more than 225 Sixth 
District Hoosiers. Time and again, I have 
heard from constituents who needed help with 
Social Security Retirement, Disability and 
Medicare. Many have reached out or sent let-
ters saying that Karrie would always lead with 
a servant’s heart, an eye for detail and a can- 
do attitude. 
My immediate predecessor, Congressman 
Luke Messer, said upon the occasion of his 
retirement from this body stated that Karrie 
‘‘made our office a better place to work, and 
she is a valuable member of our team.’’ 
For twenty years Karrie Pardieck has made 
this office better. For twenty years, she has 
been a valuable member of the Sixth District 
team. 
As she now closes this chapter and departs 
from public service, I join my predecessors 
and the many lives she has touched as a 
Constituent Services Representative for Indi-
ana’s Sixth Congressional District in wishing 
Karrie Pardieck a joyous retirement. 
Well done, good and faithful servant.

REAFFIRMING COMMITMENT TO 
MEDIA DIVERSITY 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto Rico. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to express my sup-
port of House Resolution 549, which I intro-
duced along with my colleague, Congress-
woman VAL DEMINGS, and is led in the Senate 
also in a bipartisan way by Senators JACKY 
ROSEN and MARCO RUBIO. 
As the first woman to represent Puerto Rico 
in Congress, I take great pride in being a part 
of this initiative that seeks to eliminate barriers 
that prevent media diversity. I strongly believe 
that it is our responsibility to pay it forward, 
and work to ensure that minorities are rep-
resented in every sector of society whether it 
is in elected office, in businesses, in the mili-
tary or in the media. 
This resolution is simple, Mr. Speaker. It 
sends a strong message that we in Congress 
are united in this effort to encourage media di-
versity that will benefit Americans from all 
backgrounds and walks of life stay informed 
and civically engaged. 
Whether through traditional outlets such as 
television, radio or newspaper, or through new 
technologies and digital platforms, media plays 
a critical role in our daily lives, influencing our 
perspective on almost every issue. By having 
access to independent, diverse, and local 
media contributors, our communities can be 
exposed to different viewpoints providing them 
opportunities to contribute to the crucial de-
bates facing our country. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our 
nation is diversifying at a faster ratio than it 
was ever projected. Over the last decade, 
nearly 4 of 10 Americans identified with a race 
or ethnic group other than white. Yet, this is 
not proportionally reflected in media and com-
munication occupations. 
Fifty years ago, the Kerner Commission Re-
port called for increased media diversity, citing 
that limited participation of diverse populations 
in media decision-making had negative eco-
nomic and social cost for our society. And al-
though some progress has been made, we 
can and we must do better. 
Our nation is strengthened by diverse points 
of view, diverse talents, and a workforce that 
truly reflects our country’s identity. We cannot 
wait fifty more years, we need to start now 
and promote an inclusive workforce, wel-
coming those who aspire to become journal-
ists, correspondents, creators, directors, pro-
ducers, programmers, distributors, behind the 
camera and on-air personalities. 
This resolution empowers us with the ability 
to create a strategy, build coalitions, and work 
to remove the barriers to increase participation 
in this growing industry. We must also pro-
mote diversity so that more members of our 
communities can relate. 
We have an opportunity here in Congress to 
lead the way, demonstrate our commitment to 
the American people that diverse representa-
tion in all aspects of American life are critical 
to a healthy, prosperous democracy. 
Diversity is what makes this country rich. 
Our nation is comprised of people who rep-
resent a plethora of thoughts, heritage and up-
bringing that is not always represented in the 
media, making some of these groups invisible 
to others. 
Media should be a reflection of the society 
they serve. Learning about other experiences, 
listening to different opinions, and getting to 
know other’s backgrounds strengthens our na-
tion and leads to inclusion.

REMEMBERING JEREMY DODD 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. 
LARSON 
of 
Connecticut. 
Madam 
Speaker, on Monday, December 7th, I at-
tended the funeral service of a dear friend and 
mentor. A complex, sensitive, intuitive ob-
server of this human comedy we call life. Jer-
emy Dodd was a remarkable man. I include in 
the RECORD this brief introduction is his obit-
uary written by his son, Owen, and a poem 
entitled, ‘‘The Dash.’’ 
In 1978, Jeremy and I worked down the hall 
from one another. I knew of him because his 
father was a United States Senator from Con-
necticut, who the Irish and Americans across 
the country had always taken great pride in 
his role in the Nuremberg Trials, and also his 
brother Chris, who at the time was the sitting 
member of Congress from the 2nd District and 
would go on to follow his father and become 
a United States Senator. Jeremy historically 
and culturally knew politics, he gained that 
knowledge from growing up in a family im-
mersed in it. Beyond politics, he could conduct

conversations on any subject, from sports, to 
theater, literature, art, and photography—he 
had a feel for life and a keen way of listening 
to others. Moreover, a very likable man able to 
focus in on the simple aspect of human inter-
action—the handshake, the greeting, and a 
smile. Most of all, he was great fun, always 
able to use self-deprecating humor and weave 
stories of life, history and literature from his 
unique perspective. That perspective was usu-
ally made clearer or more fuzzy depending on 
what we ordered from the top shelf. He was 
above all genuine, not without his faults, but 
his virtue far surpassed what he would call his 
inconsistencies. He was great company: en-
gaging, quick-witted, and loved a good laugh. 
The funeral was in the ancestral neighbor-
hood of his grandparents and where his fa-
ther, Tom, and his mother, Grace, are buried 
in an old Irish cemetery. The center of which 
was the Church of St. Michael the Archangel 
built by the Irish who lived in the area. The 
wooden beams, the stained-glass window, the 
tiled floor, wooden confessional, all works of 
art in their own right. 
Before the funeral began, I had the oppor-
tunity to talk with Owen, Jeremy’s son who 
was my press secretary, and present him with 
a flag flown over the United States Capitol in 
his father’s honor. I also spoke with his uncle, 
United States Senator Chris Dodd, whom I 
had been a district coordinator for in his 1980 
run for the Senate and when I came to the 
Congress in 1998 he took me under his wing 
and always gave wise counsel and stellar ad-
vice. He told me he was going through 
Jeremy’s belongings and came across this 
poem that Jeremy was very fond of. He then 
thanked me for being there and gave me this 
poem called ‘‘The Dash.’’ 
It is my honor to introduce it and include it 
in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. This poem, 
written by Linda Ellis, aptly describes Jeremy, 
his family, his father, his brother U.S. Senator 
Dodd, his son Owen, and the entire Dodd 
family: a family that was an exemplary exam-
ple of public service, love of country, ever 
committed to making a more perfect union and 
being defined by their accomplishments be-
tween ‘‘The Dash.’’ 
In Loving Memory of a Man Who Took the 
Road Less Traveled: 
Old Saybrook—Jeremy (Jerry) Murphy 
Dodd, 82, died peacefully on November 27, 
2020, due to complications from Alzheimer’s 
disease. Jerry leaves his loving and only son, 
Owen M. Dodd, his former spouse Barbara M. 
Dodd and his four siblings Thomas J. Dodd 
his spouse Mary O’Neil Dodd, Mary Carolyn 
Dodd, Senator Christopher J. Dodd and his 
spouse Jackie Clegg-Dodd, Nicholas Owen 
Dodd, and his loving friend, Joanne Hoye. He 
also leaves behind eleven nieces and nephews 
and an extensive loving family. In addition, 
Jerry joins his late sister, Martha Dodd- 
Buonanno. Jerry is the third child of the six 
children born of Mary Grace and Senator 
Thomas J. Dodd. He was born in New Haven, 
CT, on September 23, 1938, amid the New 
England Hurricane—one of the most destruc-
tive and deadliest hurricanes to make land-
fall in Connecticut. Raised in the Nutmeg 
State, he called home in North Stonington, 
Old Lyme, Old Saybrook and West Hartford. 
He graduated from the Cheshire Academy 
and then served in both the U.S. Army and 
the U.S. Coastguard where he was honorably 
discharged from both services. He then went 
on to study at Mexico City College, Mexico 
City, Mexico earning his bachelor’s in his-
tory. After graduating in 1962, as a fluent 
Spanish speaker, he hitchhiked through Cen-
tral and South America during a time of po-
litical upheaval and great transition in the 
region. This momentous time was influential 
in shaping Jerry’s worldview especially as it 
pertained to helping those who need it the 
most. Upon returning to the United States, 
he found his passion in life, photography. 
Jerry would study photography under the fa-
mous photographer John W. Doscher at the 
Doscher Country School of Photography in 
Vermont and would go on to take the por-
traits of Depression Era photographer Walk-
er Evans and the renowned ornithologist and 
painter, Roger Tory Peterson. Jerry’s innate 
photographic talent focused on families, por-
traiture, and legal photography, where he ex-
celled and was in high demand across the 
state. Later in his life, he devoted his time 
to social work. He worked with community 
service programs that were committed to the 
rehabilitation of formerly incarcerated per-
sons as he believed firmly in providing a sec-
ond chance for people. He believed deeply in 
his work and it came from a belief of a high-
er-good where one should work towards 
something larger than oneself. Jerry was a 
lover of life who cherished animals, hiking in 
the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and 
sailing on the Connecticut River in his wood-
en boat, Mrs. Jones. He was a voracious read-
er and lover of history who understood that 
we all have a story to tell, and he was eager 
to hear the histories of those he met 
throughout his life. His indelible humor was 
contagious to others, and his magnetic per-
sonality was a complete joy to be around. He 
has truly left the world and its inhabitants 
better than where he found them. There will 
be a private ceremony at St. Michael the 
Archangel Church in Pawcatuck, Rhode Is-
land on December 7, 2020, where he will be 
laid to rest next to his mother and father in 
the Dodd Family plot. 
THE DASH 
(By Linda Ellis) 
I read of a man who stood to speak at the fu-
neral of a friend. He referred to the 
dates on the tombstone from the begin-
ning . . . to the end. 
He noted that first came the date of birth 
and spoke of the following date with 
tears, but he said what mattered most 
of all was the dash between those 
years. 
For that dash represents all the time they 
spent alive on earth and now only 
those who loved them know what that 
little line is worth. 
For it matters not, how much we own, the 
cars . . . the house . . . the cash. What 
matters is how we live and love and 
how we spend our dash. 
So think about this long and hard; are there 
things you’d like to change? For you 
never know how much time is left that 
still can be rearranged. 
To be less quick to anger and show apprecia-
tion more and love the people in our 
lives like we’ve never loved before. 
If we treat each other with respect and more 
often wear a smile . . . remembering 
that this special dash might only last a 
little while. 
So when your eulogy is being read, with your 
life’s actions to rehash, would you be 
proud of the things they say about how 
you lived your dash?

Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask my colleagues in the House of Represent-
atives to join me in recognizing each and 
every one of the volunteer poll workers who 
helped with this general election as our 
Iowans of the Week. 
Iowans have long prided ourselves on how 
we engage the democratic process. For us, 
that means a lot more than simply casting a 
ballot every so often: it means really getting to 
know candidates and elected officials, attend-
ing town halls to ask questions and voice 
opinions, keeping up with the news, encour-
aging our friends and neighbors to get in-
volved, and consistently turning out to vote. To 
boil it down, Iowans believe participation is 
key when it comes to government and politics. 
As positive cases of COVID–19 continue to 
rise in Iowa, state and county election officials 
had to find a way for Americans to cast their 
ballots safely, reliably, and on time. I’m proud 
to say they did so successfully, and that feat 
required more than 10,000 everyday citizens 
to step up and participate as volunteer poll 
workers throughout early voting and on Elec-
tion Day. 
These volunteers took time away from work, 
school, and home during the week and on 
weekends to give back to their communities. 
While they came to the table with their own 
political beliefs and values, they all worked to-
gether in a nonpartisan way to make the day 
run smoothly. As the risks of COVID–19 kept 
many older volunteers at home this year, Iowa 
saw more high school students and young 
adults sign up to fill the gaps. For weeks prior 
to November 3rd, individual county election of-
fices planned and held dozens of trainings for 
volunteers to learn the ropes of being a pre-
cinct election official. On Election Day these 
volunteers staffed more than 1,600 precinct 
voting locations across the state, many work-
ing fifteen-hour shifts from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. to 
make sure every Iowan who wanted to could 
cast a ballot. 
While working early voting sites and election 
day locations, they wore personal protective 
equipment like masks, face shields, and 
gloves and continually wiped down voting ma-
chines and frequently touched surfaces to en-
sure their neighbors could participate with 
minimal risk. They made sure Iowans visiting 
the polls had masks and hand sanitizer, knew 
where to go and what to do once they got 
there, and made sure the environment was 
safe and welcoming for all. 
Elections that are free, fair, safe, and secure 
are the foundation of our nation’s democracy. 
Maintaining that standard requires consist-
ency, careful planning, and ongoing collabora-
tion each cycle. I would be remiss if I did not 
thank election officials at the state and county 
levels for their tireless work to make the 2020 
general election run smoothly across our 
state. The amount of work that goes on be-
hind the scenes by these individuals is stag-
gering. I also want to commend everyone who 
made their voices heard by casting a ballot 
this fall; their participation is how we move so-
ciety forward.

December 10, 2020 
Finally, I’d like to again extend my gratitude 
to the thousands of volunteer poll workers in 
central and southwest Iowa who stepped up to 
serve their communities and our democracy. 
They have performed an essential civic duty to 
ensure their neighbors could safely participate 
in record numbers, and they did so while deal-
ing with a global pandemic. Their efforts and 
dedication are a true reflection of Iowa values, 
and I’m proud to name them Iowans of the 
Week.

2020 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE RECIPI-
ENT 
THE 
WORLD 
FOOD 
PRO-
GRAM 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, today, 
December 10th, International Human Rights 
Day, at 7:00 AM Eastern Time, the 2020 
Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in Oslo, Nor-
way to the World Food Program (WFP) for its 
outstanding humanitarian work to feed the 
world’s hungriest and most vulnerable people. 
The World Food Program is the largest hu-
manitarian organization addressing hunger 
and promoting food security internationally, 
providing aid to nearly 100 million people in 88 
countries last year alone. 
Since the COVID–19 pandemic began 
wreaking havoc on people’s lives, livelihoods 
and economic security, WFP has redoubled its 
efforts to address global hunger and failing 
food systems. Last month, WFP executive di-
rector David Beasley warned of the potential 
for famine of Biblical proportions if the world 
failed to provide support now to the those cur-
rently made most vulnerable by the pandemic 
and its associated economic shocks, climate 
change, natural disaster, war and conflict. 
I have had the privilege of seeing WFP op-
erations up close and personal in various re-
gions of the world. I was in eastern Chad on 
the border of Sudan visiting Sudanese refugee 
camps in 2007 when Janjaweed militias 
crossed the border and attacked two villages. 
WFP and many humanitarian aid groups 
swung into immediate action, providing safety, 
food, water and emergency medical care to 
hundreds of villagers made homeless in hours. 
In Colombia, I’ve seen WFP provide nour-
ishing meals in schools for the children of fam-
ilies internally displaced by violence. And in 
Ethiopia I visited health centers serving indi-
viduals and families ravaged by HIV/AIDS that 
could provide food for their patients thanks to 
WFP and its local partners. 
In the wars in Syria, Yemen, Sudan and 
South Sudan, the deliveries of food and re-
lated services provided by WFP are often the 
only source of nourishment for civilian popu-
lations trapped in conflict zones, forcibly dis-
placed inside their countries, or forced to flee 
to neighboring nations for safety. 
I am very proud that the United States is the 
largest donor to WFP operations world-wide, 
and that USDA, USAID and our own Food for 
Peace Program are among WFP’s most reli-
able and effective partners. The U.S. provides 
food grown by America’s own farmers, ready- 
to-eat meals, cash assistance, support for 
school feeding programs, and nutritious food 
products tailored for the very young and espe-
cially for infants and young children suffering 
from malnutrition and undernutrition. 
Many of us cannot imagine the range and 
scale of WFP’s global mission. It includes 
17,000 staff worldwide, works in some 80 
countries, and has more than 20 ships, 90 
planes, and 5,600 trucks on the move on any 
given day. It certainly has some of the most 
generous and dedicated local staff that I have 
ever met and works with a broad range of 
local, national and international NGOs and 
partners to combat global hunger and food in-
security. 
I will never forget those days when I have 
been with WFP in the field. I give my warmest 
congratulations to David Beasley, and the ex-
traordinary local and international WFP staff, 
for being awarded the 2020 Nobel Peace 
Prize. May they carry on their noble mission 
until the day comes when no child, no man or 
woman goes to bed hungry and every house-
hold in the world is secure in the knowledge 
that there will always be food on the table.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
JOINT 
CENTER 
FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
STUDIES 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to acknowledge the Joint Center 
for Political and Economic Studies on the oc-
casion of its 50th anniversary. 
Founded and chartered in 1970 as the first 
of its kind, the Joint Center for Political and 
Economic Studies has since served as Amer-
ica’s chief Black think tank inside the beltway. 
Though diverse in their research and advo-
cacy, the Joint Center has remained a con-
sistent presence in the application and ad-
vancement of empirical-based policies sup-
porting strategies to advance Black America. 
Madam Speaker, it is common that any res-
olution addressing the disproportionate impact 
of a policy on the Black community introduced 
in this chamber cites a study conducted by the 
Joint Center for Political and Economic Stud-
ies. Even I, along with countless Congres-
sional Black Caucus (CBC) colleagues have 
referenced their reports when legislating and 
communicating with my constituents. The Joint 
Center plays a critical role in keeping our lead-
ers properly informed and educated on the 
issues that Black Americans face daily. 
Just last year, the Joint Center for Political 
and Economic Studies was credited for sev-
eral efforts to achieve diversity in the work-
force. Among them include bringing increased 
awareness to congressional staff diversity, cul-
minating with the establishment of the Office 
of Diversity and Inclusion in the U.S. House of 
Representatives; encouraging companies to 
consider the future of their work through a ra-
cial equity lens, resulting in companies like 
McKinsey & Company. Another example of 
the fruition of their work would be The Atlantic 
and the National Skills Coalition releasing, 
‘The Future of Work’ reports and hosting lis-
tening sessions. Over the last five decades, 
they have successfully convened leaders of 
major cities to discuss workforce moderniza-
tion in Black communities. 
The Joint Center for Political and Economic 
Studies’ work is more relevant and necessary 
now than ever before. In the face of a crisis 
disproportionately affecting Black Americans’ 
health outcomes and economic security en-
compassed by a global pandemic, we must 
push for a national agenda with viable solu-
tions that address the systemic racism that 
prompted these inequities. 
Madam Speaker, as we celebrate the Joint 
Center for Political and Economic Studies for 
their successes over the years, let us also re-
affirm our commitment as a body to working 
alongside them and others to advance noble 
ideas and policies that promote the Black 
community.

INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION 
DECLARING THAT PUBLIC TRAN-
SIT IS A NATIONAL PRIORITY 
WHICH 
REQUIRES 
FUNDING 
EQUAL TO THE LEVEL OF HIGH-
WAY FUNDING 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce a resolution declaring 
that public transit is a national priority which 
requires funding equal to the level of highway 
funding along with my colleagues HAKEEM 
JEFFRIES
from 
New 
York 
and 
AYANNA 
PRESSLEY from Massachusetts. 
Joining us in this introduction are 30 other 
members from across the country and dozens 
of organizations invested in ensuring we build 
a more just, equitable, and sustainable trans-
portation system in America. 
The near 40-year precedent of an ‘‘80–20’’ 
split between highway and transit funding 
does not reflect our citizens, businesses, and 
communities’ needs for safe, reliable, and con-
venient 
public 
transportation. 
The 
split 
underfunds transit needs leaving too many re-
liant on deteriorating transit systems with infre-
quent, inconvenient, and unreliable service. 
The 80–20 split was agreed to in 1982, 
when 1 cent of a 5 cent gas tax increase was 
dedicated to transit. But since 2008, over $144 
billion in taxpayer dollars have supplemented 
gas tax revenues for highway and transit 
spending. The user fee is not working as in-
tended, yet the 80–20 funding split persists. 
Transit is an essential lifeline for the over 
one million rural households without a car and 
millions of Americans of color disproportion-
ately reliant on public transit. 2.8 million es-
sential workers and millions more rely on tran-
sit to access their jobs, food, and health care. 
In Chicago, CTA trains and Pace Buses are 
the arteries of our city and they’ve kept our

people moving—especially frontline workers 
who keep our country moving despite the rag-
ing pandemic. 
Rebuilding a stronger, sustainable economy 
will require robust, reliable, and frequent tran-
sit and we must fund transit equitably like the 
vital public good and toll for economic em-
powerment that it is.

HONORING PENNY BISIGNANO AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, October was 
National Bullying Prevention Month. As such, 
I rise today to ask my colleagues in the House 
of Representatives to join me in recognizing 
Penny Bisignano for her efforts in bullying pre-
vention in our schools. She has played a key 
role in supporting anti-bullying training and 
programming for teachers, parents, and stu-
dents in Iowa. In fact, our Senate colleagues 
may remember Penny’s 2012 testimony on the 
issue of bullying. 
In 2018 alone, there were more than 
835,000 reported incidents of bullying among 
students ages 12 through 18. As a parent, 
these numbers are deeply concerning. While 
the act of bullying is nothing new, the rise of 
on line communication, social media, and 
smart phones has provided new and highly 
accessible environments for aggressions to 
occur. As a result, bullying has become more 
subversive and difficult to recognize. Thank-
fully, we have people like Penny who have 
coached teachers, students, and parents on 
what to look for and how these incidents can 
be prevented. 
While working with school counselors, 
Penny began to see concerning trends in the 
way children were treating each other. She re-
alized she wanted to help people better under-
stand the seriousness of bullying and how dif-
ficult it can be for children to talk about. In 
2004, she decided it was time to act and set 
her sights on championing bullying prevention 
statewide. 
For years, Penny ran the Olweus Bullying 
Prevention Program in Iowa. The Olweus Pro-
gram has a comprehensive approach to cre-
ating a positive and safe environment in 
schools. The program’s goal is to not only re-
duce the number of bullying incidents in 
schools, but also improve relations between 
students. By addressing antisocial behaviors, 
this programming has been found to reduce 
bullying among students as well as truancy 
and vandalism. Iowa is fortunate to have not 
only quality programming available, but also 
so many dedicated organizations working to 
keep all children safe. 
A longtime education consultant, Penny has 
participated in the Iowa Safe and Supportive 
Schools Grants Team, focusing on prevention 
and intervention. She’s provided training and 
networking statewide and facilitated various 
projects for the improvement of schools and 
teachers’ roles in bullying prevention. Penny 
also expanded her expertise beyond Iowa by 
dedicating five years to the Board of Directors 
for the International Bullying Prevention Asso-
ciation. She eventually founded her own small 
business, Bisignano Consulting and Coaching, 
to work on several projects including a study 
observing possible links between bullying and 
chronic health conditions. 
Penny remains passionate about bullying 
prevention. In fact, she’s come out of retire-
ment three times to continue her work. That 
speaks volumes about Penny’s character and 
rings true for so many Iowans: if there’s a job 
to do, they won’t rest until it’s done well. She’s 
now enjoying her fourth (and hopefully final) 
retirement while still offering expertise when-
ever asked. Penny hopes her fellow Iowans 
continue having conversations about bullying 
so children and adults alike can learn how to 
better care for one another, and I couldn’t 
agree more. It is my honor to recognize Penny 
Bisignano as our Iowan of the Week.

CELEBRATING A.G. HEINS 
COMPANY 100 YEARS OF SUCCESS 
HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, Amer-
ican entrepreneurial spirit is the bedrock of our 
nation’s economy, creating good-paying jobs, 
solving everyday problems and providing the 
goods and services we rely on. I rise today to 
celebrate one of East Tennessee’s own, the 
A.G. Heins Company, which rode that entre-
preneurial spirit from humble beginnings to 
100 years of success. 
Currently in its fourth generation of family 
ownership, the A.G. Heins Company has long 
provided building materials to the East Ten-
nessee region. The company provides nec-
essary resources to complete projects of all 
sizes, from individual household repairs to 
construction at the University of Tennessee. 
Staying in business for 100 years is no easy 
accomplishment, and the A.G. Heins Com-
pany persevered through many challenging 
economic times, such as the Great Depres-
sion and the Second World War. The com-
pany’s history is a reminder that small busi-
nesses can grow and innovate even in the 
face of adversity. 
I would like to extend my congratulations to 
the Heins family as they celebrate their 100th 
year in business this month, and I wish them 
many more years of success.

REMEMBERING ANNABELLE 
BEAUCHAMP 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I 
arise today to honor the short life of Annabelle 
Kristine Beauchamp of Bellevue, Kentucky. 
Annabelle was only three years of age when 
she left us on December 2, 2020. But in that 
short time on earth, she inspired a multitude of 
people with her great inner strength, deter-
mination, and fearless zest for life. She bedaz-
zled the world as to how anyone so frail could 
be so powerful. 
Born with Downs Syndrome and a badly 
damaged heart she endured against all odds. 
Annabelle fought her way through numerous 
surgeries, and frequent and prolonged stays in 
the hospital. In the end, it still took a mon-
strous and murderous worldwide pandemic to 
vanquish her. With her death-grappling strug-
gle she easily won all of us to her side. As Vir-
gil wrote, ‘‘those things doomed to die, touch 
the heart.’’ 
Against the torrent of hardships which beset 
her from the very beginning, sweet Annabelle 
gallantly soldiered on through it all. With her 
captivating smile and determination, she 
breathed life into the state’s ethos of unbridled 
spirit. 
Though faced with many obstacles at birth, 
Annabelle was richly blessed with two incred-
ibly brave and loving parents—Will and Jessi 
Beauchamp. They proved to be a match in 
love and devotion with little Annabelle’s un-
daunted courage. 
Anyone blessed to have known Annabelle 
during her short life knows that she did not in-
tend to leave us so soon. She intended to live, 
to grow, to thrive and to bless us all for a long 
time to come. She intended to stay and bless 
us, no matter what it took. But, tragically, 
death conquers the earthly vessel in which we 
live, even if possessed of the vigor and zest 
as our little heroine. Annabelle left behind a lit-
tle bit of herself wherever she went. No 
amount of physical impediments nor human 
restraints can be retentive to the strength of 
spirit. She left us with the eternal gift of that 
spirit. Even now, though freshly gone, she 
whispers to us in her own unique and endear-
ing voice. 
Do not stand at my grave and cry, 
I am not dead, I did not die. 
I am the stars that shine at night, 
I am the sun in morning’s light. 
Do not stand at my grave and cry, 
I do not sleep, I did not die.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DAN F. 
MOHON 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life 
and legacy of Dan Mohon who passed away 
on December 6, 2020, just four days shy of 
his 81st birthday. Dan filled his days with hard 
work and loyal service to his faith, family, 
friends, and community. 
Dan F. Mohon was born in Vernon, Texas, 
on December 10, 1939, to his parents Walter 
and Flora Pauline Beach Mohon. Just before 
his 13th birthday, Dan, as the eldest child, 
took on the responsibility of caring for his 
mother and younger siblings, Nanene and 
Gary, following his father’s death. In order to 
care for his family, Dan worked 32 hours a 
week while continuing his education. 
After Dan graduated from Quanah High 
School in 1958, he attended Texas Tech Uni-
versity where he graduated with a degree in

real estate and insurance. While at Texas 
Tech, he met the love of his life, Shirley 
Manon Hacker of Oklahoma, whom he mar-
ried on December 22, 1962. 
The Mohons moved to Orange, Texas in 
1974 along with their two young sons, Monty 
and Marcus. They didn’t have many material 
possessions upon arriving in Orange, but what 
they lacked in worldly goods they made up for 
in determination, loyalty, and love for one an-
other. 
Dan was a man who loved deeply and ex-
travagantly, and that devotion sprang from his 
faith. His love of God was showered on his 
wife, sons, grandchildren, family, church, and 
community. He adored people and spent his 
life showing others what it meant to live joy-
fully. 
As a leader of his community, Dan had the 
distinction of serving as mayor of two Texas 
cities—Orange and Pinehurst. In addition to 
his civic involvement, Dan also served as 
treasurer of First Baptist Church and as a 
board member of the Lutcher Stark Theater 
for 25 years. He also served in various com-
munity organizations such as the Greater Or-
ange Area Chamber of Commerce, Lamar 
State College Foundation, American Red 
Cross, City of Orange Planning and Zoning 
Commission, Southeast Texas Regional Plan-
ning Commission, Orange Rotary Club, and 
his favorite, the Orange Lions Club, where he 
served as president and carnival chairman. 
Dan was also the proud recipient of the Melvin 
Jones award, the highest form of recognition 
for a Lions Club member. A devoted advocate, 
Dan had perfect attendance at club meetings 
for more than 47 years. 
Along with God, his family, community serv-
ice, and his many friendships, two other real 
passions Dan enjoyed were golf and ice 
cream, both of which he often shared with oth-
ers. 
Dan is survived by his wife of 58 years, 
Manon; two sons, Monty and Marcus; and ten 
grandchildren: Joshua, Annabeth, Katharine, 
Joseph, Isabelle, Jack, Mason, Gray, Reed, 
and Bliss. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Dan 
Mohon for his unwavering dedication and 
service to his community. I offer my deepest 
condolences to his family and friends.

HONORING BARBARA KAIMAN 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Mrs. Barbara Kaiman for her 
outstanding leadership and positivity as she 
serves those in need in her local community 
and fights food insecurity in Mills County. Bar-
bara has acted as the food bank director, as 
well as serving many other roles, for the Mills 
County Storehouse in Glenwood for more than 
20 years—all on an entirely volunteer basis. 
I’m pleased to name Barbara our Iowan of the 
Week. 
Over her years of service, Barbara has wit-
nessed firsthand the need for assistance—but 
the past two have been especially hard on 
families in Mills County. Between the historic 
flooding across Southwest Iowa in the Spring 
of 2019 and the current COVID–19 pandemic, 
she has seen the need for support and assist-
ance increase. In February, the Mills County 
Storehouse served 185 families. In March, that 
number jumped up to 240. Barbara has said 
she is willing to scour the entire area for dona-
tions wherever she can get them, including 
driving for an hour to personally pick up hun-
dreds of baked goods for distribution. 
It is Barbara’s belief, as she told my team, 
that the goodness of people always seems to 
come home. To anyone who has met Barbara, 
it is immediately apparent that she loves her 
community and strives to do what she can for 
those most in need. 
Every week, she calls each of her families 
and reads them a list of what’s available in the 
pantry. And with COVID–19, Barbara has en-
sured a safe working environment for all of her 
volunteers and patrons by adapting to the new 
standards they must meet. Her volunteers 
have diligently followed safety protocols with 
masks and gloves. Mills County Storehouse 
has begun home deliveries for the first time in 
Barbara’s time with them. And they have con-
tinued to meet the needs of their community 
despite increased demand. 
It is my distinct honor to name Barbara 
Kaiman as our Iowan of the Week, and thank 
her for her commitment to volunteering and 
ensuring food security for those families most 
in need. Although we do not know what the 
next months will bring, we know we can de-
pend on those dedicated Iowans like Barbara 
to step up to the plate no matter what comes 
our way.

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER AND 
SERVICE 
OF 
WILSON 
COUNTY 
COMMISSIONER ALBERT GAMEZ 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Wilson County Commissioner (Pct. 1) 
Albert Gamez and his 19 years of service to 
his community. 
Commissioner Gamez was known as a 
hands-on public servant that took an active in-
terest in all the issues that he faced. He was 
an individual that was committed to getting the 
job done and in an efficient manner. There are 
numerous stories about him that attest to his 
work. For example, if a storm had passed 
through the community and caused any dam-
age, he would be there immediately. If there 
was a fire in the area, he would be sure to 
show up and make sure that the local fire-
fighters had everything that they needed. In 
addition to his active approach, he was known 
for fiscal responsibility and making sure that 
his county had the funds they needed to make 
infrastructure improvements. 
For his efforts, Commissioner Gomez was 
honored with several awards and recognitions. 
He was awarded the Watershed Wise Award 
by the San Antonio River Authority (SARA), 
recognized by the Floresville Volunteer Fire 
Department for 30 years of service, and noted 
by the Floresville City Council for voicing his 
concerns regarding the building of a prison in 
the city. In addition, he was recognized for his 
work during the floods of 1998 and 2002. 
As we move forward, let us take the time to 
appreciate the work of public servants like 
Commissioner Gamez and all the individuals 
who commit themselves to the public good. It 
is critical that we recognize those who took it 
upon themselves to improve their community. 
However, in the words of President John F. 
Kennedy, ‘‘As we express our gratitude, we 
must never forget that the highest appreciation 
is not to utter words, but to live by them.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I take this opportunity to 
recognize the career and service of Wilson 
County Commissioner Albert Gamez.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF 
TRAVIS 
COUNTY 
COMMIS-
SIONER GERALD DAUGHERTY 
HON. LLOYD DOGGETT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, today I 
express appreciation not only for myself but 
on behalf of so many of our neighbors for the 
valued service of Travis County Commissioner 
Gerald Daugherty, who is retiring after serving 
Precinct 3 honorably for 14 years. 
Long before Commissioner Daugherty be-
came an elected official, from the Pleasant 
Valley Sportsplex to Jack Allen’s Kitchen, he 
made significant contributions to our entertain-
ment and our waistlines as a business leader. 
We don’t always agree. After all, Commis-
sioner Daugherty is a Republican, but I salute 
him for his integrity and true commitment to 
public service. And he did get off to a good 
start long ago giving up the Boston Red Sox 
to become a fellow Longhorn. Especially dur-
ing these divisive political times, when we 
need more bridges, not walls, public servants 
such as Commissioner Daugherty deserve our 
gratitude for attempting to bridge the political 
divide by seeking bipartisan solutions. 
Commissioner Daugherty’s thoughtful and 
respectful demeanor, with an eye to detail, 
benefitted the Travis County Commissioner’s 
Court and Travis County taxpayers. He is re-
spected as an advocate for our veterans and 
an active supporter of the Travis County Vet-
erans Service office in its commitment to mili-
tary veterans. service-members, and their fam-
ilies. Importantly, this year he early recognized 
the threat of this COVID–19 pandemic and of-
fered strong leadership in protecting lives and 
livelihoods. 
Many of us remember his last campaign in 
2016 or at least we remember his wife, 
Charlyn. His ad, which went viral internation-
ally, employed a humorous touch featuring 
Charlyn and friends listening to him endlessly 
talking about the obscure details of county 
policies, with Charlyn wondering what she 
would do with him were he not reelected and 
devoting himself to the County. At a time 
when negativity filled the airwaves. his mes-
sage was a breath of much needed levity as 
well as depth. I trust that in addition to time 
with his great family, Commissioner Daugherty 
will find a hobby in his retirement, but I also 
know that he will remain engaged in the affairs 
of our community. 
Commissioner Daugherty leaves office with 
the esteem of colleagues and departments 
with whom he worked. I thank him for his 
service to our community and I wish him well 
in all his future endeavors.

HONORING ELLEN DUNLAP 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, it is a 
great honor to rise today in recognition of 
Ellen Dunlap of West Boylston, Massachu-
setts, who is stepping down as President of 
the American Antiquarian Society after 28 ex-
traordinary years in that position. 
America’s history, Madam Speaker, is our 
greatest natural resource. It speaks to us 
across the years and serves as a source of 
great inspiration and hope for people across 
this country. It is an acknowledgement of 
America’s triumphs and our imperfections; a 
reminder of who we are and who we’re called 
to be. 
Ellen is the President of the American Anti-
quarian Society—a remarkable institution in 
Worcester, Massachusetts founded by Revolu-
tionary War patriot and printer Isaiah Thomas 
in 1812 and dedicated to preserving our treas-
ured history. The Society serves as an incom-
parable resource for scholars and historians 
and a preeminent and comprehensive deposi-
tory of American history and culture that is un-
paralleled in size and scope. 
As President—the first woman to hold that 
post, by the way—Ellen has spent her career 
not only preserving our past, but bringing it to 
life in a way that truly excites others. Ellen’s 
work and leadership are extraordinary, she 
has the incredible talent and vision to clarify 
and animate history so that all of us can better 
understand and learn from our collective past. 
She has worked tirelessly to open up the Soci-
ety’s extraordinary archives to a wider audi-
ence, including teachers, scholars, artists, and 
writers. Under her leadership, the Society un-
dertook a massive effort to digitizing their col-
lections. Ellen also spearheaded the construc-
tion of a major expansion and renovation of 
the Society’s home at Antiquarian Hall, and 
has sought to engage the Worcester commu-
nity in new and exciting ways like free public 
programs 
and 
partnerships 
with 
cultural 
groups. 
Ellen has chaired the board of the Worces-
ter Cultural Coalition and the Massachusetts 
Foundation for the Humanities, and she has 
advised many prestigious institutions such as 
the Library of Congress and George Washing-
ton’s Mount Vernon. Ellen’s vision and leader-
ship earned the American Antiquarian Society 
a National Humanities Medal from President 
Barack Obama in 2013. 
Madam Speaker, there is so much more I 
could say about how grateful I am that Ellen 
has devoted her life to preserving our Amer-
ican story and how lucky we are that the 
American Antiquarian Society calls Worcester 
home. But let me end on a personal note to 
say that Ellen is a treasured friend and a won-
derful person, I’m grateful that I’ve had the 
privilege of getting to know and work with her, 
and I know she will continue to give back to 
our community in the years ahead. 
On behalf of the United States Congress, 
the people of Massachusetts’ Second Con-
gressional District, and all the people who will 
benefit from her incredible work for genera-
tions to come, it is my great honor and privi-
lege to recognize Ellen Dunlap and to thank 
her for her remarkable service to our commu-
nity, our commonwealth, and our country.

HONORING NILS BACKSTROM AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I ask the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing an Iowan who embodies the value of a 
strong work ethic and the dedication it takes to 
learn a trade. Earlier this month we celebrated 
National Apprenticeship Week to highlight the 
impact and value of apprenticeship programs 
across the United States. To continue that 
celebration, 
I 
am 
proud 
to 
name 
Nils 
Backstrom, a union carpenter in Iowa with the 
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners 
of America, as our Iowan of the Week for the 
week of November 20th. 
Leaders in the Carpenters Training Program 
have described Nils as a pillar of what it 
means to be an active apprentice in their pro-
gram. He’s always the first to volunteer for 
projects and has been a member of the Ap-
prenticeship Committee since its inception. 
From the day Nils arrived at training, he has 
pushed both himself and the instructional team 
to be the very best at what they do. 
The benefits of apprenticeship programs 
cannot be overstated. They supply Iowa busi-
nesses with well-trained employees to get 
tough jobs done well and on time, and folks 
like Nils are the backbone of these programs. 
These professionals are instilled with both the 
technical skills required of the job and leader-
ship capacity that is so highly sought after. 
Apprentices complete 7,000 hours of on-the- 
job training and more than 640 hours of class-
room learning. 
Supplying a pipeline of highly skilled em-
ployees for the future is a critical role appren-
ticeship programs play in not just Iowa but na-
tionally as well. Ensuring vital industries like 
information technology, healthcare, building 
trades, and advanced manufacturing are filled 
with the right people is crucial for building our 
future. What’s more, the work is rewarding 
and Iowans in these positions make a good 
living for their families. The Department of 
Labor has shown that Registered Apprentice-
ships have a 94 percent job placement rate at 
the conclusion of the program—with a highly 
competitive salary. 
The importance of protecting and enhancing 
our workforce by supporting these apprentice-
ship programs should be an issue we can all 
get behind. Nils Backstrom is one of many 
hundreds of thousands of skilled apprentices 
across the nation. His spirit and drive, and that 
of his colleagues, are needed to build towards 
a better future for all individuals. 
I’m grateful to Nils and his fellow appren-
tices for their dedication to their trade and 
their contributions to growing our state. We 
need more individuals like him to join the trade 
and fill highly in-demand, skilled positions 
available right here in Iowa. I ask the House 
to join me in honoring Nils Backstrom as 
Iowan of the Week.

SUPPORTING 
H. 
RES. 
823—CON-
DEMNING 
OF 
IRAN’S 
STATE- 
SPONSORED 
PERSECUTION 
OF 
ITS BAHA’I MINORITY 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 10, 2020 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I’m elated 
to announce that earlier this week my col-
leagues and I were able to unanimously pass 
H. Res. 823, which condemns Iran’s state- 
sponsored religious persecution of its Baha’i 
minority. Iran has gone too long depriving its 
citizens the most fundamental of human rights, 
and I’m proud that we were able to call out 
Iran and hold them accountable for their atroc-
ities against their own people. 
I firmly believe that it is our duty in Con-
gress to stand up to this tyrannical regime, 
and I have been committed to that cause 
since I first came to the House of Representa-
tives. One of my first ever bills in Congress, 
the Iran Human Rights Act of 2007, focused 
on improving the respect for fundamental 
human rights of the people of Iran. It specifi-
cally recognized the plight and suffering of the 
Baha’i minority and that they face significant 
discrimination, including imprisonment, harass-
ment, and intimidation. 
The Iranian state’s treatment of the Baha’i 
people is deplorable, and the fact it is moti-
vated simply because of their faith is wholly 
unacceptable. Religious freedom is an issue 
that personally touches me, as I have had 
family and friends who have been victims of 
religious persecution. This makes me espe-
cially conscious of the incredible importance of 
ensuring that religious freedom is respected 
around the globe. Religious freedom is a fun-
damental human right outlined in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, and all people 
deserve a government that will respect their 
rights. 
Our darkest moments as a human race 
have come during times when those who 
knew better stood silently, making excuses for 
passivity and allowing injustice and persecu-
tion to reign. While I celebrate the passage of 
H. Res. 823, I recognize there is more we can 
do. As Co-Chair of the International Religious 
Freedom Caucus and member of the Tom 
Lantos Human Rights Commission’s Executive 
Committee, I stand with the Baha’i people 
against the injustices wrought against them by 
the Iranian government, and I call upon the 
United States and the international community 
to continue pressuring Iran to cease the per-
secution of its religious minorities and its viola-
tions of basic human rights. The Baha’i people 
deserve no less.
