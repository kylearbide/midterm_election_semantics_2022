f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
September 11, America was attacked 
by evil. Thousands of our countrymen 
were murdered by terrorists. In an in-
stant, the Nation was gripped with fear 
and anxiety. And as our buildings 
burned, we mourned the loss of our fel-
low Americans, but as we mourned, we 
also became very united as a country. 
We came together and stood as one 
against a common enemy. That unity 
laid a foundation for our victory, and it 
helped our military men and women 
deliver justice to those who sought to 
destroy us. 
Now, we confront a similar challenge. 
Unlike the 9/11 attacks, our enemy 
today is faceless. We can’t see or hear 
that enemy. We can’t send our Armed 
Forces to hunt it down and protect us, 
but much like our response to the ter-
rorist attacks nearly 20 years ago, we 
must unite as a country. The threat we 
face is perhaps the greatest since World 
War II. So much like our response to 
the terrorist attacks 20 years ago, we 
will be united. 
Never before have we shuttered so 
much of our country: businesses clos-
ing, restaurants particularly, all kinds 
of—just stay at home, in other words. 
Never before has our society changed 
so much, seemingly overnight. 
The coronavirus issue could prove as 
deadly as any war in recent history, 
and that is why it is everyone’s respon-
sibility to do their part. 
In Congress, we have already passed 
legislation to provide emergency relief, 
and our job isn’t done yet. Further, un-
precedented 
economic 
and 
public 
health support is on the way, but what 
we do in Washington and State capitols 
across our country is only one part of 
that solution. It is the civic duty of 
every community, every family, and 
every individual to enlist in this fight. 
Make no mistake, our Nation is at 
war—a war on our own soil. This war 
and this enemy aren’t like anything 
that we fought before. Our strategy 
and tactics will be different, but the 
stakes are just as high. 
This war will not be waged on foreign 
lands with tanks or guns or troops. It 
will be waged right here in hospitals 
and public places and in homes and 
with personal responsibility, personal

sacrifice, and patience on the part of 
our people. 
It is on every American to exercise 
these values: Do not gather in large 
groups. Don’t hoard crucial goods. 
Keep your distance from those you 
must be near. Protect yourself and oth-
ers by washing your hands, covering 
your cough and sneeze, and cleaning 
commonly used surfaces. Work from 
home if you can. Check on your neigh-
bors. Call your relatives. Offer to help 
each other, especially the most vulner-
able. We are all in this together. 
Much as we did before, we must shed 
party labels and put aside partisan pol-
itics. We must band together and hold 
on to our national identity, our fami-
lies, and, most importantly, our faith. 
Throughout history, Americans have 
risen to the occasion when confronted 
with crises. I am confident this time 
will be no different. 
It is up to each and every American 
to fight the spread of this deadly virus. 
Countless lives depend on it. The days 
and months ahead will be tough for ev-
eryone. But just like post-World War 
II, a safer, a healthier, and a more 
prosperous United States of America is 
just around the corner. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday I introduced the Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security 
Act: Senate Republicans’ bold proposal 
to continue combating this health cri-
sis and the economic crisis it is caus-
ing. And I called on our Democratic 
counterparts to join us immediately at 
the table for urgent discussions so the 
Senate can deliver measured relief to 
the American people as soon as hu-
manly possible. 
I am glad to say that talks are al-
ready 
well 
underway. 
Earlier 
this 
morning, a number of our committee 
chairmen began indepth, bipartisan 
talks with their Democratic counter-
parts. We were joined by representa-
tives from the administration, and 
those talks continue right now as we 
speak. 
Here are the next steps: These Mem-
ber-level discussions will proceed with 
the goal of reaching agreements on 
each of four components of the legisla-
tion by the end of today—by the end of 
today, agreements on each of these 
four components. 
This would allow the first procedural 
vote to occur before the end of the day 
tomorrow, and that would allow a bi-
partisan package focused on immediate 
challenges to pass the Senate Monday. 
The Nation’s needs and expectations 
are perfectly clear. Workers, families, 
small businesses, and the foundations 
of our economy itself need swift action. 
And in the Senate, ‘‘swift’’ means bi-
partisan. 
The Senate rose to the occasion ear-
lier this month. We united across party 
lines to pass billions in quick funding 
to support the medical response, and 
we did it again just this week. We 
passed the more modest proposal that 
came over from the Democratic House 
quickly and in a bipartisan fashion. 
Now our Nation needs a major next 
step, and we need it fast. That is why 
Senate Republicans produced a bold 
initial proposal to give shape and 
structure to these discussions. 
First, our CARES Act will deliver di-
rect financial help as quickly as pos-
sible to the American people. Senate 
Republicans want to put cash in Amer-
icans’ hands. 
For Americans who have lost work, 
this would be the quickest possible 
first wave of government assistance to 
supplement unemployment insurance 
and help with bills and immediate 
needs. 
For our Nation’s seniors, this would 
supplement Social Security and pro-
vide further relief to those who are at 
heightened risk and have had to change 
their routines literally overnight. 
And for Americans still working, this 
infusion of money would provide a lit-
tle more certainty in this very uncer-
tain moment and the opportunities to 
invest in local economies where pos-
sible. 
Second, our proposal would provide 
the quickest possible access to des-
perately needed liquidity for small 
businesses all across our country. Our 
proposal would use existing channels 
and small businesses’ existing lending 
relationships to provide hundreds of 
billions of dollars in emergency cap-
ital, a significant cash infusion as fast 
as possible so that more small busi-
nesses can hold on to their workers, 
weather this disruption, and come out 
on the other side instead of having to 
resort to layoffs or shutdowns right 
away. 
So no tangled new bureaucracies, no 
delay of this urgent aid while we try to 
redesign complex programs from the 
ground up, just the most direct path— 
the most direct path to the cash that 
small businesses need to keep making 
payroll, while, in many cases, the gov-
ernment itself is chasing away their 
customers 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
public 
health. 
This straightforward approach is al-
ready earning support. A coalition of 
small business advocates has already 
written to express their hope that 
‘‘both Republicans and Democrats can 
come together’’ to pass this. 
Third, our bill recognizes a big, 
structural, national crisis requires a 
big, structural response. Let me say 
that again. Our bill recognizes that a 
big, structural national crisis requires 
a big, structural response. 
We want to empower the Treasury 
Department to engage in targeted lend-
ing—not bailouts but loans—to key 
sectors and industries which this pan-
demic is hurting. 
Again, we want to preserve employer- 
employee relationships wherever we 
can. We have to fight to protect jobs, 
and we need to recognize that our Na-
tion will need industries to come back 
online quickly on the other side of the 
crisis. 
Fourth—and this is crucial—our leg-
islation will continue to push surged 
resources to the frontlines of the med-
ical battle against the virus itself. We 
want to expand access to testing and 
treatment to further encourage and 
speed up research on therapeutics and 
eventually vaccines, to continue to 
fund the hospitals and health centers 
that are treating patients, and we want 
to expand healthcare workers’ access 
to critical equipment and supplies, in-
cluding—including—respirator masks. 
These are the four big things our bill 
seeks to do. As we speak, at this very 
moment, Senators on both sides are 
discussing the details and exchanging 
suggestions on all four of the pillars 
that I have just outlined. 
So, once again, this will not be the 
first bill we pass to combat this crisis 
or the second, and I do not expect it 
will be the last. 
This legislation does not need to con-
tain every piece of the ongoing na-
tional effort. In fact, that would be im-
possible. 
But 
everyone—everyone— 
from public health experts to econo-
mists, to working families of this coun-
try—everyone—has made it clear that 
we need to deliver relief and we need to 
deliver it now. 
We need to go big. We need to mini-
mize new complexity, and we need to 
move swiftly. We need to push imme-
diate relief to Americans. We need to 
keep Americans employed as much as 
possible and help job creators literally 
stay afloat. We need to continue taking 
action to stand with medical profes-
sionals 
and 
protect 
our 
Nation’s 
health. 
Laid-off workers cannot wait. Strug-
gling Main Street businesses cannot 
wait. Our hospitals and health centers 
cannot wait. 
So, as I said, I hope these Member- 
level 
discussions 
will 
be 
able 
to 
produce agreements in principle on all 
four components by the end of the day 
today. In fact, they must reach agree-
ment by the end of the day today. That 
would leave tomorrow for drafting leg-
islative text and for the first proce-
dural vote on the shell. And that 
should allow a bipartisan package, fo-
cused on immediate challenges, to pass 
the Senate on Monday. 
The crisis is moving fast. The Senate 
is here, we are working, and we are 
going to deliver.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1863 
March 20, 2020 
MORNING BUSINESS 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will be in a period of morning 
business, with Senators permitted to 
speak therein for up to 10 minutes 
each. 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
f 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to 
associate myself with the remarks of 
the leader. I want to thank him for all 
of his efforts to pull these task forces 
together who are now working across 
the aisle to come up with this package 
that we should be able to start working 
on today or tomorrow. 
I appreciate his comments that we 
are going to work through the week-
end. This is unusual for the Senate and 
for the House, but the Senate is here, 
the Senate is working, and we are try-
ing to come up with solutions that will 
keep America moving. 
I particularly want to talk about one 
piece of the package because I have 
been getting calls from small busi-
nesses—small businesses that are say-
ing: We have been shut down; we have 
been told that we can’t do anything 
with our business right now. 
Now, it is not all businesses. I do 
know that grocery stores are doing 
very well, probably having their best 
year ever. That will tail off a little 
later in the year, when people are over-
supplied, but right now grocery stores 
are probably doing well. 
Every other part of the economy is 
doing poorly, whether it is restaurants 
or shoe stores. I think I saw where they 
even got permission now to deliver liq-
uor. Before, you had to buy it in the 
store. You couldn’t get it delivered to 
your house. But, it is a concession, be-
cause of the difficulty that we are hav-
ing, to keep from shutting down every 
business. That concession has been 
made in some places now. 
But my point is that small business 
employs most of the people in this 
country, and small business is the one 
that is having difficulty right now. Big 
businesses always have a little bit of 
leeway, a little bit more of a forward 
plan, and because of their size, they 
have more flexibility. A small business 
does not have that. 
What has been brought to my atten-
tion this last week are people who have 
payroll coming up. They have said: 
Now, we have been kind of shut down— 
shut down by the government, they 
like to say, but it is shut down by the 
virus, actually. The virus is what is 
creating this panic, and in order to 
keep people well, we have suggested all 
these 
different 
things 
that 
people 
ought to be doing, and I hope they are 
following that. 
But, for small business, this is disas-
trous. If they are not selling anything, 
they have no cash to pay their employ-
ees. If they are not selling anything, 
they don’t need the employees. If they 
don’t need the employees and they fire 
the employees, then, they go onto un-
employment. And the unemployment 
lines are long. 
That is not where we want people. We 
want people—particularly the ones who 
are trained for a particular job—to be 
available for that job the minute that 
job is available again. 
One of these packages takes care of 
that situation. One package will pro-
vide for loans to small businesses, pro-
vided they keep their people on. 
Now, remember, these people aren’t 
producing anything. So there is no rev-
enue coming in to pay that loan off. So 
it also provides that, provided they 
keep their employees and when the 
thing is over they still have their em-
ployees, the payroll part of that and 
any immediate need—there are other 
things that they absolutely have to 
pay. They have to pay their rent, or 
somebody else has a financial problem. 
They have to pay for the electricity 
and the heat and all of the regular 
things that a business has to pay for, 
besides employees. But, provided they 
have kept those employees on, those 
direct costs will be forgiven. So that is 
encouragement for every small busi-
ness out there to relax a little bit. 
I always say that the definition of a 
small business is when the owner 
wakes up in the middle of the night 
and says: Tomorrow is payroll. How am 
I going to make payroll? 
Believe you me. That happens to 
those small business men out there. If 
you have a bad week, who doesn’t get 
paid? The owner doesn’t get paid. He 
has to pay those people, and he does 
pay those people because he wants 
those people around. 
That is the crisis we are facing: How 
do we keep those people around so 
that, when the business comes back, 
they are available and the business can 
go forward as it did in the past? 
This package will do that. I only 
wish that there was some way we could 
do it faster than Monday. And don’t 
hold your breath. We are talking about 
Congress. That doesn’t mean things 
will get done by Monday. They ought 
to be done today, but Monday looks 
like the earliest possible time that 
they can get done. 
So the message that I am giving is 
this: Small business men, hang on. 
Hang on a little bit longer. If this 
passes, you will be able to keep your 
employees. 
Their employees will be paid. That is 
important. That is the way to get 
money out into the economy: Pay em-
ployees, and let them keep their health 
insurance that way. If they go onto un-
employment, they lose their health in-
surance. We don’t want that to happen 
either. 
So this is the solution that needs to 
happen right away for the employees, 
as well as the employers. I had a call 
from one this week who said: I have to 
declare bankruptcy. If you do some-
thing, will I not be eligible because I 
declared bankruptcy? It is a reorga-
nization bankruptcy, but I need to re-
organize so I can find the cash to pay 
my employees. 
So I am pretty sure that the bill has 
a stipulation in it that, if you declare 
bankruptcy after March 1, you will be 
eligible for this plan and be able to 
keep your business going—not in a 
comfortable situation, because none of 
us knows when this is all going to be 
over. None of us knows what the resid-
ual effects are going to be on the busi-
ness world. 
But we do need to have a vibrant 
business world out there providing for 
the needs of people. We have really be-
come reliant on others. Hardly any of 
us produce our own food anymore. 
Hardly any of us produce anything that 
we use anymore. 
We could and we can—and people 
probably are—just get by, but that is 
not what we are used to. That is not 
what we expect. That is not how we 
live. That is not how we enjoy life. We 
enjoy it by being able to have a job and 
buy the things that we need to have 
and do the recreation that we want to 
do. 
So I am hoping that this package can 
go through in an expedited way, and I 
am particularly hopeful that the small 
business part, which is where most of 
the people in the United States work, 
can go through so that they can be 
paid, so that they can keep their insur-
ance, and so that they are ready to do 
what they have been trained to do and 
want to do and like to do when the 
time comes that this virus has passed 
and people can be out there doing all of 
the things that they like to do again. 
So I encourage the small business 
men to hold on. Help is coming. That is 
pretty tough to hear from Congress, I 
am sure, but this is one where I think 
people are realizing the severity and 
the importance of speed and how many 
people there are. Well, I don’t think we 
have quite grasped how many people 
yet are involved in this and could be 
saved by this, but we will. 
I ask that the businesses hang on 
while we do our job, and I thank the 
Senate for staying through the week-
end to work this problem so that we 
can do it in a timely manner—hope-
fully, by Monday. 
Hang on out there, America. Help is 
on the way. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1864 
March 20, 2020 
in the legislation currently being con-
sidered in the Senate to respond to the 
coronavirus public health emergency. I 
laid out priorities ranging from shoring 
up the hospital systems to measures to 
provide direct assistance to students, 
workers, 
businesses, 
and 
families 
through this economic crisis. 
Since that time, Leader MCCONNELL 
has released the Republican draft of his 
offering for this third package. It is a 
250-page bill that some estimate will 
cost $1 trillion. That is a daunting 
pricetag, except when you put it in 
context of the American economy and 
what it takes to keep us on track or 
put us back on track. 
Our top priority must be immediate, 
direct relief to the healthcare sector— 
our heroic doctors, nurses, first re-
sponders, lab techs, and the hospitals 
and health clinics they support. 
Yesterday I spent an hour on the 
telephone with the Governor of Illinois, 
J.B. Pritzker, talking about the reality 
on the ground in my home State and 
the choices he faced. It is a tough job 
being Governor—never tougher than 
when you have to make a decision 
about the lifestyle of families and indi-
viduals, about the businesses and their 
future, and, literally, a life-and-death 
choice in terms of policy. No one will-
ingly accepts that, but when you run 
for high office, there is always that 
possibility. 
He is concerned—and I share his con-
cern—about the capacity of our hos-
pitals and clinics in Illinois to deal 
with the infections that are becoming 
more and more common in our State. 
The numbers of infections are growing 
as the number of tests are increasing, 
which is an indication that there are 
many undiagnosed people in our midst, 
and that number is likely to continue 
to increase. 
Those who administer the hospitals 
of Illinois have given us some yard-
sticks to measure the future. They sug-
gest to us that if 20 percent of the pop-
ulation of my State should become in-
fected for a 12-month period of time, 
they will need 88 percent of our hos-
pital resources to respond. If that same 
20 percent becomes infected over a 6- 
month period of time, it will be double 
that capacity; in other words, 176 per-
cent of our current hospital capacity. 
It would push our system beyond the 
breaking point. If the infection rate, 
though, is double that—40 percent for 
any period of time—our hospitals, as 
good as they are, as big as they are, as 
prepared as they are, can’t handle it. 
If that is the situation in our State, 
it is the situation in many other 
States. At that point, we will be deal-
ing with serious overcrowding and 
triage decisions being made under 
heartbreaking circumstances. 
That is why many of us on this side 
of the aisle feel that this third package 
offered by the other side really needs 
to be changed and improved so that we 
do have what Senator SCHUMER is call-
ing a Marshall Plan for the hospital 
work healthcare of America. We des-
perately need it, and we need it now. 
Waiting to come and face us at a later 
date makes it that much more dif-
ficult. 
Our 
health 
system 
is 
currently 
stretched to its absolute limit: surge 
staffing, emergency protocols, short-
falls of masks and protective equip-
ment, and cashflow running out in just 
weeks. The plan that we have before 
us—the draft plan from the other side— 
does not address these needs. It has no 
new appropriations, no real funding or 
authorization for staffing or equipment 
and only meager changes when it 
comes to programs like Medicare. 
What this pandemic demands is that 
Marshall Plan for healthcare, an imme-
diate funding boost to our healthcare 
systems, clinics, and health depart-
ments, mass production of masks, res-
pirators, gloves, and ventilators. 
Two days ago, the President ac-
knowledged that he has the authority, 
under what I believe is called the De-
fense Recovery Act, to say to manufac-
turers: change whatever you are mak-
ing and make more respirators and 
change whatever you are making in 
terms of masks and make more med-
ical-grade masks to meet the needs 
across this country. I hope the Presi-
dent will use that authority. That is 
why it was created in the law. 
We also need to support our work-
force. We need to increase Medicaid 
funding, and we need to put an end to 
Medicare sequestration and DSH cuts. 
I am also calling for the inclusion in 
this package of a bill known as the 
Rural Hospital Relief Act. I am cospon-
soring that bill with Senator JAMES 
LANKFORD, a Republican, of Oklahoma. 
It would keep the most financially vul-
nerable hospitals afloat during this 
challenging time by providing them ac-
cess to the stability of the Critical Ac-
cess Hospital Program. Every State 
with smalltown hospitals and rural 
hospitals should pay close attention to 
this bill that we put in. It could be a 
great help to hospitals that are other-
wise struggling. Anything less, I am 
afraid, we will be turning our backs on 
the selfless and heroic work of the 
frontline health workers. How can we 
say enough about these nurses and doc-
tors and healthcare workers—these 
men and women—who literally risk 
their lives for every patient that comes 
through the door. 
We need to maintain access to 
healthcare for people who lose their 
jobs as a result of this pandemic too. 
We must offer Federal funding to cover 
the costs of COBRA coverage for people 
who lose their jobs but want to keep 
health insurance. Currently, if you lose 
your job and you have health insurance 
where you work, you can maintain 
your current health insurance, but you 
have to pay for the employer’s share 
since you no longer work there. The 
premiums go through the roof in those 
circumstances, and many people can’t 
afford these COBRA payments. Why 
don’t we include in this third package 
coming before us a subsidy for those 
families so they can keep their health 
insurance, even if they are not on the 
job? We certainly don’t want them un-
insured. It is not good for them. It is 
not good for our country. It is cer-
tainly not good for our health system. 
It is bad enough that millions of people 
may lose their jobs; we don’t want to 
also have them lose their healthcare in 
the midst of a public health emer-
gency. Let’s step up and help them 
now. 
I was not included during the draft-
ing of the bill that was presented by 
Senator MCCONNELL, but I would like 
to give two pieces of feedback from two 
colleagues from his side of the aisle. 
The first said, referring to this pack-
age: 
Relief to families in this emergency 
shouldn’t be regressive. Lower income fami-
lies shouldn’t be penalized. 
That was a quote from Senator 
HAWLEY of Missouri, a Republican Sen-
ator. 
A second Republican Senator said, 
referring to this draft package: 
[T]he current bill . . . shouldn’t give lower 
earners smaller checks . . . that’s directly 
contrary to my proposal . . . we need to fix 
this to ensure lower earners get equal pay-
ments. 
That quote is from Senator ROMNEY 
of Utah. 
I agree with both of them. We should 
make sure that if there is any financial 
relief coming to people across the 
country, those in lower income cat-
egories should get as much, or more, 
than anyone else. 
I cannot agree more with their as-
sessment. 
The 
direct 
cash 
benefit 
measure in this plan would give those 
the most in need of assistance in the 
lower income categories sometimes 
nothing at all. 
Additionally, the bill contains a pro-
vision that would allow middle and 
higher income earners to receive more 
of a benefit than low to moderate earn-
ers. That is upside down. 
Goldman Sachs released projections 
this week that unemployment claims 
may rise to 2.25 million this week. 
That would be the highest level on 
record. This proposal that we have 
been given by the other side falls far 
short of making sure we have enough 
resources to deal with this influx of un-
employment claims. 
The bill also lacks any moratorium 
on evictions and foreclosures, leaving 
those who are particularly vulnerable 
at risk of being cast out on the street 
during a public health crisis. Instead of 
expanding paid sick leave to more who 
need it, I am afraid the new bill tries to 
further limit that protection. 
The McConnell bill provides no addi-
tional funds to the military. We have a 
supplemental appropriation which is 
supposed to be taken up. Why isn’t it 
married into this bill? Why don’t we do 
it all at once, get it done? We know we 
are going to need it, and there is no 
point in delaying it. 
We need to help our military, and we 
need to provide resources to many of

our States that are high and dry be-
cause of the cost of dealing with this 
public health crisis and the additional 
claims on their unemployment bene-
fits. 
We need the National Guard and the 
Defense Department pushing assistance 
to every level of government during 
the pandemic. That means supplying 
masks and ventilators and beds to com-
munities that need them. 
I am also, with Senator DUCKWORTH— 
my colleague of Illinois—reaching out 
directly to the Department of Defense. 
I want to find out if we can start build-
ing field hospitals in the parking lots 
of major hospitals across our State. We 
have done it before when we had to— 
particularly when dealing with the 
Ebola crisis overseas—and we need to 
do that right here at home and take 
the expertise of the Army Corps of En-
gineers and other professionals at the 
Pentagon. They are ready to move at a 
moment’s notice to build a field hos-
pital, if needed, for our men and women 
in uniform. Let’s take that same will-
ingness and expertise and translate it 
into more bed capacity and room ca-
pacity at the hospitals most in need. 
The protective equipment across this 
country still is not at the level it 
should be for the men and women in 
the military as well as those in civilian 
life. 
The proposal before us ignores the 
desperation we are hearing from cities 
and town and States. Without tax reve-
nues coming in, they are running out 
of cash to keep operating services and 
meeting payroll. We need a surge of 
Federal funding through current pro-
grams with flexibility for States and 
localities to allow them to keep paying 
their workers and ensuring things like 
transit, airports, schools, and housing. 
The McConnell plan also does not 
provide much needed education assist-
ance to deal with the increased ex-
penses related to closing schools and 
moving to online learning. We have to 
make sure that this new technology 
keeps our kids learning, even though 
they may be home in the process. It 
provides nothing for these emergency 
needs. That bill, I hope, will be im-
proved today as the Democrats get a 
chance to sit down with Republicans 
for the first time and talk about com-
promises. 
The Republican majority leader him-
self said this is a public health crisis 
with an economic crisis strapped to its 
back. I couldn’t agree more. Where are 
the test kits? Where is the protective 
equipment? Where is the assistance for 
working families? Let’s get it done. 
The Senator from Kentucky is giving 
us a deadline to do it by tomorrow. I 
think that is ambitious, but let’s try to 
meet it and do it on a bipartisan basis. 
I couldn’t agree more that some af-
fected industries—like the airlines and 
hospitality, 
along 
with 
small 
and 
midsized businesses—need to be as-
sisted. We can also take care of Amer-
ican workers and families at the same 
time. I think it is incumbent on us to 
do both. 
In short, the Senate needs to act now 
to fix the major flaws pointed out by 
both Republicans and Democrats in 
this third package. I stand ready to 
work on these fixes. 
Just a few minutes ago, I left one of 
the working groups, and it was a very 
positive atmosphere and attitude in 
which the two sides were sitting down 
and trying to work out their dif-
ferences. 
For the dark time ahead, we need to 
continue reminding American people 
that we can rise to the challenge—both 
political parties—not to politically 
fight but to find political answers and 
compromises that solve these problems 
I have outlined here today. 
The bottom line is, people are sitting 
at home. Some are even following C– 
SPAN in their absolute boredom, try-
ing to figure out what to do with their 
lives, and they are listening to our 
speeches. 
My report is this: We passed two 
major pieces of legislation involving 
billions of dollars. We have done it in 
record time. We have done it on a bi-
partisan basis. Both have been signed 
by the President. This third measure 
that may reach a trillion dollars in 
cost is a challenge, for sure, but one we 
can meet again on a bipartisan basis. 
We owe America, at this moment in 
our history, nothing less. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

unanimous consent that the order for

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
coronavirus continues to challenge our 
Nation in extraordinary ways that 
were unimaginable a few weeks ago. 
Our public health systems are coming 
under enormous strain. Our hospitals 
and other medical facilities lack the 
necessary supplies and resources. As 
measures to isolate the public broaden, 
workers are filing for unemployment at 
unprecedented rates. Small businesses 
are on the brink of collapse. American 
families are desperately in need of sup-
port until they can resume their nor-
mal lives. 
I have heard from these people and 
the people who are isolated. I have 
heard from people who have sick loved 
ones in nursing homes and can’t enter 
to see them. I have heard from small 
business people who struggled their 
whole lives to build a small business, 
and it finally looks like it is beginning 
to succeed, and they may be wiped out. 
The urgency of doing something now 
is so important. Both parties in Con-
gress must work together as swiftly as 
possible to get something done that is 
as big and bold as possible. This is one 
of the worst crises America has faced. 
The American people need help fast. 
Senator MCCONNELL
has proposed 
what is now the third phase of legisla-
tion to confront the coronavirus. We 
are all eager to work in a bipartisan 
way to quickly get another bill to the 
President’s desk. But at the moment, 
the McConnell bill is inadequate. Lead-
er MCCONNELL’s proposal does not do 
nearly enough to address the public 
health crisis in terms of hospitals, 
medical supplies, beds, doctors, nurses, 
and measures to ensure that Americans 
can 
access 
and 
afford 
coronavirus 
treatment. 
The bottom line is very simple: If we 
don’t deal with the health crisis, noth-
ing we do will make the economy any 
better. So that is No. 1. 
If we don’t have help for our hos-
pitals, many small ones are going to 
close. Rural ones will close. Big ones 
will have real trouble. We must do 
something. Yet there is nothing in 
Leader MCCONNELL’s bill to help hos-
pitals. Now we are told we may do it 
later in a supplemental. Later is no 
good. We need a Marshall Plan for hos-
pitals right now. 
Local governments that are also on 
the frontlines need to get dollars in 
their pockets. Many of them will go 
broke. 
Leader MCCONNELL’s proposal is also 
skewed in favor of corporations rather 
than the workers and families who ur-
gently and much more acutely feel the 
pain of reduced hours and unemploy-
ment. Leader MCCONNELL’s proposal in-
cludes a few ideas that shouldn’t be in-
cluded at all, such as tax cuts for mul-
tinational corporations and restric-
tions on paid sick leave that Congress 
just expanded. 
This morning, Democratic ranking 
members of six committees met with 
the Republican chairs of corresponding 
committees to hear the rationale be-
hind the McConnell bill and to begin a 
bipartisan dialogue. Democrats will 
soon respond with policies we believe 
must be included in the legislation and 
things that we don’t think belong in 
this legislation. 
Our goal is twofold: Address the pub-
lic health crisis now, and put workers 
first as we do it. 
Democrats want to do as much as 
possible to prepare our healthcare sys-
tem for the growing storm it faces, and 
we want to help the working Ameri-
cans who are most immediately af-
fected by the economic slowdown and 
help them in real and significant ways. 
In that respect, Democrats have five 
important priorities that I will speak 
about now, among others. We have 
many other priorities as well. We are 
sending all of our priorities over to the 
Republicans soon enough.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1866 
March 20, 2020 
No. 1, America needs a Marshall Plan 
for hospitals and our public health in-
frastructure. In a few weeks, hospitals 
could be overrun with patients, and 
there will still be a great shortage of 
gloves, masks, ICU beds, ventilators, 
and especially testing. To cite just one 
example, the two biggest hospitals in 
Albany—Albany Medical Center and 
St. 
Peter’s 
Health 
Partners—an-
nounced they are suspending testing in 
order to conserve the few they have for 
healthcare workers and high-risk pa-
tients. Access to tests continues to be 
a problem in other places throughout 
my State as well. 
There is great shortage of equipment. 
The story that rings in my ear is that 
certain places that have the tests don’t 
have the swabs so they can undertake 
the tests. We are short of supplies up 
and down the line. It is masks. It is 
protective clothing and gear. It is beds. 
It is doctors and nurses themselves. We 
have to do more. We need a Marshall 
Plan right now for our healthcare sys-
tem. 
Two weeks ago, 3, 4 weeks ago, many 
of us were talking about the problem 
that testing—the lack of good testing 
was about to occur. Many of us said 3 
weeks ago, 4 weeks ago, that if we 
don’t have these tests, everything is 
going to go down the drain. No one lis-
tened—at least no one in the adminis-
tration—until recently. Well, we are 
saying now that in 2, 3 weeks, our hos-
pital situation will be the same. It will 
be massive and deeply in trouble. That 
is why we need to act now—not later 
with a supplemental but now. 
We also need to dramatically in-
crease unemployment insurance—what 
we are calling employment insurance. 
It is really unemployment insurance on 
steroids. But it helps people furloughed 
from their jobs, so we call it employ-
ment insurance. Why do we need it? 
Because so many workers have been 
forced home and are prevented from 
working regular hours. If you work in a 
restaurant and there are no customers, 
you are not going to work. The boss 
you worked for and worked so well 
with for years can’t afford to pay you. 
To go on existing unemployment in-
surance won’t work. It is hard to ac-
cess. It doesn’t cover a whole lot of 
people. Furthermore, it does not pay 
back workers the full wages they were 
earning. We need to change all three of 
those things so that, No. 1, every work-
er who is unemployed gets a paycheck 
equal to what they were earning before 
this crisis, paid for by the Federal Gov-
ernment. That way, the business— 
small, medium, large—can put them on 
furlough, and then, when the crisis is 
over, they are back. There is money in 
their pockets. No workers, no family, 
no one should lose a paycheck or go 
into financial ruin as a result of the 
coronavirus. This is a very important 
provision. 
I talk to people all across my State 
and the country, and when they hear 
about it, they love it. It is not giving 
money to everybody. There are some 
people, thank God, who are still em-
ployed, but there are many, many peo-
ple who have lost their jobs, and one 
check, when they may be out of their 
jobs for 3, 4, 5 months, isn’t going to be 
enough. 
Unemployment 
insurance 
gives money the whole period of time 
the crisis exists at your present salary 
level and covers just about everyone. It 
makes the most sense of any program 
that I have heard in dealing with those 
who are losing their jobs, and it helps 
in terms of dealing with stimulating 
the economy because we will bring the 
economy back to where it was. All 
these unemployed people will be get-
ting paid the same amount of money. 
Third, paid sick leave is a must. We 
need to be expanding paid sick leave, 
not restricting it, as this current pro-
posal suggests. Senators MURRAY and 
GILLIBRAND, working in conjunction 
with their colleague Congresswoman 
DELAURO in the House, put together a 
good bill. It should be in this big pro-
posal. 
Fourth, we need to put our workers 
first. If we are going to consider bailing 
out industries, they cannot then be al-
lowed to turn around and cut jobs, cut 
wages, cut benefits. They cannot be al-
lowed to use the money for stock 
buybacks. They cannot be allowed to 
give salary increases to executives. 
Phase 3 needs to put workers first, pe-
riod. These are our values. 
Finally, we need to rescue small busi-
nesses. Many of them have been asked 
to close their doors for the sake of pub-
lic safety. We need to help businesses 
access the necessary liquidity to pay 
their insurance bills, to pay their rent 
or mortgage, to pay their expenses so 
that when this crisis ends, they can re-
bound stronger than ever. 
Democratic ranking members are al-
ready discussing these priorities with 
their 
Republican 
counterparts. 
Of 
course, there are many other priorities 
as well. It would take too long to high-
light all of them, but they are all in 
white paper we have sent to Leader 
MCCONNELL
and to the Republican 
chairs. In almost all these cases, Demo-
crats already have prepared and draft-
ed the legislative language on these 
priorities. We are ready to go. 
About 2 hours ago, I spoke with 
President Trump about these five pri-
orities. I mentioned them all, and 
President Trump told me he was open 
to these ideas. In fact, the President 
explicitly told me he would oppose 
companies using bailout money on 
buybacks, even though such a prohibi-
tion is not in MCCONNELL’s bill. 
I also urged the President to imme-
diately employ the Defense Production 
Act and harness industry to get ven-
tilators and other critically needed 
medical equipment to those who need 
it. He told me he would do so and then 
said to someone who must have been in 
the Oval Office—or wherever he was— 
to get it done. So I think we are on the 
road, because we can’t waste a day in 
terms of getting the DPA going. Con-
gress will make available very quickly 
whatever resources are needed to the 
Defense Department in order to imple-
ment this act. 
More broadly, I told the President we 
need to come together and cooperate in 
this time of national crisis. He agreed. 
We need to work with uncommon speed 
and make this next bill what it needs 
to be. We need it to be workers first, 
with a Marshall Plan for hospitals. The 
Democrats are already at work with 
our Republican colleagues to get this 
done. 
Now, it has been 20 days since the 
first case of COVID–19 was detected in 
New York. Today, 20 days later, there 
are 7,000 cases—more than a third of 
the total number in our country. In a 
time of public emergency, New Yorkers 
have been asked to make extraordinary 
sacrifices. The Governor has just man-
dated that, excepting essential serv-
ices, 100 percent of New York’s work-
force must stay home. The city that 
never sleeps is, for the moment, dor-
mant. 
To all of my fellow New Yorkers, 
stay strong. We will beat this back, 
and on the other side, we will come 
back stronger. 
To the thousands of New Yorkers and 
more across the country who have vol-
unteered to join our medical reserves 
to help sick patients, thank you. God 
bless you. The Nation owes you a debt 
for your courage and willingness to an-
swer the call to serve. 
Our medical workers are already per-
forming a herculean task, and it will 
only get more daunting in the days to 
come. 
Know this, workers: The country is 
with you. We support you; we respect 
you; we love you; and we are already 
working on policies that will ease your 
burden, as much as that can be 
achieved. 
Finally, to my Senate colleagues, 
what we must do in the next few days 
is unlike anything any of us has ever 
done in our time in Congress. This is a 
crisis without modern precedent. We 
are going to have to flex some muscles 
that may have atrophied. We are going 
to have to cooperate in ways that we 
may not be accustomed to. We are 
going to have to work across the aisle 
and across the span of this Capitol to 
produce momentous legislation in the 
span of a few days. We will do it be-
cause we must do it. The American 
people are suffering. Our businesses are 
shuttered. Our factories lay idle. Our 
workers are without work. Let us come 
together and do whatever is necessary 
to protect the American people in this 
time of historic challenge. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1867 
March 20, 2020 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, this 
past week, we have seen that the 
spread of COVID–19 has really become a 
crisis not just for our Nation but a cri-
sis for every American. Today, millions 
of Americans are asking themselves 
how they will endure this crisis, how 
long will the crisis last, how will it af-
fect their families, their communities, 
and their Nation as a whole. 
We have many people who are now 
trying to do the dollars-and-cents of 
this crisis, literally sitting down to try 
to calculate how many weeks they can 
stretch the last 2 weeks of pay. 
We see people who have been fur-
loughed, had their hours reduced, been 
laid off. 
We have seen that small businesses— 
from the mom-and-pop pizza joints, to 
small interior design shops, to barber 
shops—are all trying to determine how 
they can keep themselves afloat when 
their doors are closed and how they can 
deal with their fixed costs. 
I have been on the phone with so 
many employers in my own State who 
have spoken to me about the chal-
lenges they have trying to continue to 
cover the health insurance of their em-
ployees even with the fact that no rev-
enue is being brought in by their busi-
nesses. 
Over and over again, restaurants, 
bars, coffee shops, our sports arenas, 
hotels—all of them have been emptied, 
and millions of workers have been let 
go and had their hours slashed. 
On top of that, schools across this 
country, 
from 
colleges 
to 
kinder-
gartens, have been closed, and millions 
of families are now scrambling to try 
to find childcare. College students are 
displaced and moving back in with 
families. 
This is, on so many levels, a true cri-
sis like none of us have ever faced be-
fore in our Nation. The emotions are 
running the gamut. People are angry. 
People are afraid. People are fearful for 
their own physical safety, as well as 
their economic well-being. 
This is something that is challenging 
because we do not know how long it 
will last. The one thing we do know is 
that this crisis is a shared one, but 
many people face their own privately 
painful challenges. I will give one ex-
ample. 
There is a single mother in my 
State—a mother of two—who works at 
a nursing home and is also raising her 
granddaughter. At work, she cares for 
elderly patients, and because family 
members can no longer visit, she is ris-
ing to the challenge of not just being a 
professional there, but she also feels 
she is serving as a surrogate family 
member. Now, for weeks, the basic per-
sonal protective equipment she needs 
to keep herself safe is in short supply 
and is literally dwindling. 
For all of this incredible work, this 
incredible dedication literally on the 
frontlines, she makes $14 an hour. With 
schools now closing, her teenage chil-
dren will be responsible for caring for 
her granddaughter while she works be-
cause she can’t afford childcare. She 
doesn’t know what she would do if she 
got sick and actually had to miss work. 
She is living every day afraid of get-
ting the coronavirus. 
There are millions of families in a 
similar situation and millions of Amer-
icans who are getting up every day 
knowing that their going to work is es-
sential for the well-being of others. Yet 
they still don’t know how they will 
take care of their families. 
The most recent bipartisan relief 
package that came out of Congress, the 
Families First Coronavirus Response 
Act, is a very important step in helping 
those 
families 
and 
combating 
the 
spread of the virus and its effects. It 
will help to increase testing, ensure the 
availability of emergency paid family 
and sick leave for many workers, in-
crease food assistance programs, and 
make emergency unemployment insur-
ance available for more workers who 
really, really need it. 
Now, as we turn to the next package 
of policies and funding to help Ameri-
cans who are suffering now, we know 
this is a moment that demands bold, 
decisive action and doesn’t leave any-
body behind. We know we are a nation 
born out of crisis. We know that our 
founding ideals—you have to under-
stand that this government was formed 
to protect people and to defend people. 
We, in our Declaration of Independ-
ence, talk about mutually pledging to 
each other our lives, our fortunes, and 
our sacred honor. The spirit of this Na-
tion is about being there for each other 
and coming together to be stronger de-
spite the crisis, despite the challenge. 
I am so grateful at this time that we 
are seeing bipartisan work on both 
sides of the aisle, as we are all seeing— 
from our personal lives to our States as 
a whole—we are all seeing the urgency. 
I am worried now that the first pro-
posal that we have seen, though, falls 
short of addressing the needs of our 
healthcare workers and first respond-
ers—those Americans who are really 
putting themselves out there. I am 
confident, though, that we are going to 
come together in the coming hours to 
try to create a package that rises 
above or rises to meet the moment we 
are in. 
Right now, our Nation’s first re-
sponders, our firefighters, and our 
healthcare 
professionals 
are 
being 
asked to respond to situations where 
they don’t have the personal protective 
equipment they need to stay safe. In 
my own city, I talked to the head of 
public safety, who talked to me about 
the courage of these folks who, no mat-
ter what, are going to go to work, even 
without that protective gear. But, dear 
God, shouldn’t we be doing everything 
we can, because if they get sick, if they 
can’t show up, we will see a cascading 
crisis. It would be disgraceful. It would 
be dangerous. 
It is not an exaggeration to say that 
if we don’t move quickly to get per-
sonal protective equipment to our 
frontline responders, we are going to be 
ill-equipped not just to fight COVID–19, 
but we could see widespread interrup-
tions in the delivery of all lifesaving 
emergencies in America. Also, this bill 
we have seen now, which we must 
make better, must address not just this 
issue but also do more for healthcare 
workers and first responders to get 
them the equipment they need. 
There are a lot of things that I feel 
strongly about that I know will be in 
these negotiations. 
We should all be able to agree on sup-
porting our veterans and VA facilities 
as they prepare to fight this virus. 
There are gaping holes in that in this 
bill. 
We should all agree on funding for 
our transit systems—like Amtrak— 
that are going to make sure to keep 
our country connected, that those sys-
tems don’t fail and fall, especially 
when we will need them switched on 
and running vibrantly when our econ-
omy gets going. We should all agree 
that this is a time to deal with some of 
the massive shortfalls that we have 
now more than ever. 
While places like South Korea have 
universal broadband penetration, we 
should all agree that broadband access 
in devices for our students is critical if 
we are going to continue to educate 
our children for the months ahead. 
We should all agree on providing 
tests for our troops that are still serv-
ing in high-risk areas like Afghanistan. 
We need to make sure these bills ad-
dress these holes. 
We should all agree on strengthening 
our community colleges and our minor-
ity-serving institutions so they, too, 
can continue to educate their students 
digitally. These are holes that must be 
filled. 
We should all agree that we need to 
be providing funding and flexibility for 
our schools and food banks to continue 
to serve meals to children in our coun-
try so that, crisis or no crisis, the next 
generation 
can 
grow 
healthy 
and 
strong. 
We should all agree that the utilities 
in our Nation should not be shut off 
during this crisis—we need to address 
that in this bill—so that families, re-
gardless of income, who are already 
now struggling to make ends meet 
don’t see themselves without light, 
power, and gas. These holes in this bill 
should be addressed. 
We should all agree that everyone 
must have coverage for testing and ac-
cess to healthcare services that keep 
them and their families safe, and that 
includes the people who are in our 
country, whether they are documented 
or not, because our health is directly 
interrelated with their health. And to 
make sure that the only people who 
can get treatment are citizens of the 
United States—ignoring the millions of 
people who are not—means that the 
citizens of the United States are at 
risk. 
We should also think about those 
folks whom we don’t think about

enough, like those who are incarcer-
ated, as well as the correction officers 
and workers who deal with those who 
are incarcerated. We are not doing 
enough to address that pending crisis 
in our country. There are holes in this 
bill. 
I want to take one moment, though, 
to address an aspect of this bill which 
there seems to be general consensus 
about but which can be made so much 
stronger, and that is the issue of cash 
payments. 
Economic relief packages coming 
from this body should be about offering 
everyone relief, including those who, 
through no fault of their own, now find 
themselves on that financial brink. 
It is why we must strengthen unem-
ployment compensation that includes 
both increasing benefits across the 
board and expanding eligibility to in-
clude more workers, like gig economy 
workers and other independent work-
ers. That is why I specifically want to 
address this cash payment part, be-
cause that is not enough. As for the 
idea of cash payments, I am so grateful 
to see a lot of my colleagues be sup-
portive of that idea. 
Earlier this week, Senators BENNET, 
BROWN, and I, along with several of our 
colleagues, proposed sending cash pay-
ments directly to American families, 
starting with $2,000 sent immediately 
to every American, low- and middle-in-
come, with additional payments if our 
economy remains in distress. Under 
our plan, in the worst case scenario, 
over 
an 
entire 
year, 
with 
three 
tranches of payments, if our economy 
remains in distress, a family of four 
would be eligible for $18,000. 
Critically, our plan would not require 
an income threshold to receive pay-
ments, which means that everyone 
under a certain income level would 
qualify. 
The current proposal would exclude 
exactly the people and households who 
actually need it most. By creating an 
income requirement and phase-in, this 
plan currently proposed would be skip-
ping over the most vulnerable people. 
That means a mom who quit her job to 
spend the last year caring for her sick 
child or a husband or a parent with 
Alzheimer’s, whose full-time job has 
been caring for that spouse or loved 
one, would receive nothing under this 
plan. 
It also means that a college student, 
forced to leave school, now no longer 
having the sources of support at col-
lege, trying to enter the job market 
but not able to, would receive nothing 
under this plan. 
Some tipped workers, seasonal work-
ers, and people coming out of the 
criminal justice system, who paid their 
debt to society, would receive nothing 
under this plan. 
This is a moment where we have to 
understand that we should be thinking 
boldly and acting in a bipartisan way 
at a scale we have never seen before be-
cause we have never seen a crisis like 
this before. This is not a time to do 
something that is anemic, that is inad-
equate, that leaves some of the most 
vulnerable people out in the cold, when 
we know those people—they are our 
family members; they are our neigh-
bors—wouldn’t qualify for the plan as 
it is right now. 
I know those family members be-
cause they are people who live in my 
community. 
Someone 
who 
worked 
their entire life, who has a mother who 
is dying, just last year quit their job to 
try to support her. These are folks we 
know. They might even be in our own 
family. We shouldn’t exclude them at 
this time. By the way, including them 
helps to further the impact of the stim-
ulative effects of this plan. It literally 
puts more money in our economy and 
into the hands of people who will spend 
it, and that will have a multiplier ef-
fect. 
We need to be injecting cash directly 
into our economy and giving people 
agency again in their lives at a time 
when so many people feel helpless 
amidst this health and economic crisis. 
And, God, we need to be doing it 
quickly, getting payments to people as 
soon as possible. For seniors, these 
payments should simply be added to 
their next Social Security check. And I 
remind you that about 7 million of our 
seniors live at or below the poverty 
line because their Social Security 
checks don’t go far enough. For vet-
erans, they should receive theirs at the 
same time they get their VA benefits. 
We can do that quickly. For everyone 
else, the IRS should send checks or de-
posit funds directly into their bank ac-
count. 
These are the kinds of actions we 
need to ensure that, once we get 
through this public health crisis, we 
have the tools in place we need to reac-
tivate the world’s greatest economy 
and enable it to recover. 
The great thing about designing 
something this way is that we could 
put it in place now, while we are all as-
sembled here as a body. I said this to 
my caucus, and I didn’t mean it to be 
in any way draconian. But there are 100 
of us, and it is likely some of us could 
be sick. While we are all assembled 
here, let’s put things in place so they 
are triggered. If the economy is still 
down, it triggers the next set of ac-
tions. Instead of having to come back 
here and negotiate more now, put 
things in place with automatic triggers 
so 3 months from now, if the economy 
is down, it triggers more action, like 
the next tranche of payments. At the 
end of the year, if the economy is still 
where it is, let’s trigger another auto-
matic payment. That is not just com-
mon sense; it is proactive. It means 
that people can begin to rely on those 
resources and do that kind of planning, 
by having predictable sources of in-
come, and not having the challenges 
that I am starting to find now, just for 
a week or 2, which are the emotional 
challenges, the stress of families. 
I talked to medical professionals this 
week who worry about this home isola-
tion, people stressed over bills, and 
people worried about their next pay-
check. This is an emotional strain to 
our country and will have physical 
manifestations. 
I want to say that I love my Nation 
for so many reasons, but one of the rea-
sons is because it has often been my 
life experience that during the tough-
est times, I have witnessed the best of 
us. 
I was a college student in 1989, when 
a horrible earthquake hit the Bay 
Area. In Stanford, we were closer to 
the epicenter than even San Francisco 
was. I remember the fear, as people 
were knocked out of their homes. But 
the other thing I saw was America. I 
saw the best of who we are—people 
pulling together, sheltering friends, 
sharing food. It was one of these expe-
riences, as a young person coming of 
age, that I will never forget. I am not 
happy an earthquake happened, but, 
God, it so inspired me to see the best of 
who we are. 
Later, as a young man and a city 
councilman in Newark, about 10 miles 
from the World Trade Center, 9/11 hap-
pened—horrible, horrible things. I lost 
my childhood best friend in one of 
those buildings. 
God, in that crisis, what did we do in 
this country? God, I remember the 
lines—people lining up in front of hos-
pitals to donate blood—how people 
pulled together, stood for each other, 
and sacrificed for each other. There 
was something so powerful and so pa-
triotic—people remembering that pa-
triotism is not a flag pin, and patriot-
ism is love of country. You cannot love 
your country unless you love your fel-
low country men and women, and love 
is not sentimentality. It is sacrifice. It 
is service. It is being there for each 
other. 
God, when Hurricane Sandy hit New 
Jersey and thousands of people lost 
their homes and power was shut off in 
our communities for days or over a 
week, again, I saw the best of who we 
are as a nation. In a crisis, in a chal-
lenge, we don’t pull apart. We pull to-
gether. We stand up for each other. We 
serve each other. It may put us back 
individually, but the generosity I saw— 
people reaching into their bank ac-
counts, buying blankets, buying food— 
was inspiring. They were putting peo-
ple up in hotels who were out of their 
homes. 
It hearkened me back to the stories I 
heard from my parents and my grand-
parents about what it was like in the 
Great Depression in poor communities 
in the South and how much people 
were there for each other. It reminded 
me of World War II. My grandmother, 
literally, until the day she died, an Af-
rican-American woman, was bragging 
about her victory gardens, how eagerly 
and how it gave her pride that she was 
rationing—how this poor woman, who 
worked as a domestic at times, was 
buying war bonds. Everybody was 
pitching in. That is who we are. That is 
America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1869 
March 20, 2020 
Now the wealthiest Nation on planet 
Earth is facing one of its biggest trials. 
I pray it is one of the biggest trials in 
my lifetime, if not the biggest trial. 
The wealthiest country on the planet is 
showing what we are called to be. I 
have always felt, as the prophet Elijah 
says in the Bible, that we are the light 
onto other nations—about how we pull 
together, stand together, fight through 
a storm, and fight through a crisis. We 
are showing what we do for each other. 
It is not just the men and women sit-
ting in these seats. It is all of us. In the 
greatest crisis of our lifetime, what are 
you doing for other people? 
I pray our legislation keeps that spir-
it in mind. When the most common 
faith talks about what are you doing 
for the widower, what are you doing for 
the orphan, what are you doing for 
those people in prison, I hope we keep 
that in mind. 
It is not a time for half steps or half 
measures. It is time for the bold spirit 
of America, where we stand up for each 
other. We don’t pull apart; we come to-
gether. We don’t tear down; we rise up. 
That is where we are right now in 
American history. In this great global 
pandemic, we are a light unto each 
other, as well as to the world. 
And for the Senate, right now, while 
there still are 100 of us here doing the 
work, let’s do it nobly and boldly and 
with generosity of spirit. Let’s extend 
civic grace because this crisis is not 
bigger than who we are. 
We will endure. We shall overcome. 
May God bless America, and may God 
bless each and every one of us. 
Thank you. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it 
has been so interesting talking to our 
Tennesseans as they have faced these 
issues we have with coronavirus and 
what is happening, our response to it, 
and how we are going to fight it. And 
yes, we are going to win this war, and 
we are going to defeat this, but we 
have to look at it as our health, food, 
and financial assistance. 
Last night, a couple of my Ten-
nesseans and I were discussing this— 
what their thoughts and their ques-
tions to me were about the relationship 
we have with China and how can we 
trust that we know what China knew, 
that we know when they knew it, and 
their lack of transparency around what 
happened with COVID–19. 
As we have gotten a couple of months 
past the start of this, these questions 
are unanswered. As I was telling our 
Tennesseans on the phone last night, 
even as this virus that came out of 
Wuhan, China—they had it in Decem-
ber. It has now touched six continents, 
and we know people are dealing with 
containment. They are dealing with 
mitigation. They are dealing with 
going through the process of getting 
the anti-virals, getting the vaccines 
that are necessary to deal with COVID– 
19. 
The 
questions 
that 
people 
have 
around this are compounded by the 
growing realization of how China has 
chosen not to be honest and not to be 
transparent in their dealings with the 
rest of the world. The way Beijing han-
dled 
its 
initial 
response 
to 
the 
coronavirus was nothing new. In fact, 
deflection and lies meant to protect 
the Communist Party is part of their 
standard operating procedure. They 
have defied norms governing the pro-
tection of human rights. They embrace 
innovation by incursion, defy property 
rights, and steal intellectual property 
as a matter of course. 
We have U.S. companies that have 
suffered for decades from what China 
has done to steal their intellectual 
property, to infringe on their intellec-
tual property. They defy the sov-
ereignty of other nations and terri-
tories, and they defy what should be 
their role as a leader in the global 
economy. Certainly, they want to be a 
market economy or so they say, but 
look at their behavior. It is this act of 
defiance that makes them incredibly 
dangerous. 
I have to tell you, this has been 
something that has been going on for 
quite a while, but we only need to go 
back a decade to place a flag marking 
our awareness of what has become a 
very familiar story. Over the decades, 
as China started to manufacture and 
started to pull U.S. manufacturers 
there and then started to mistreat 
their intellectual property rights, peo-
ple became aware of what was going 
on. It was right at 10 years ago, when 
I was a Member in the House, that we 
were doing much of the same work that 
we are doing right now in the U.S. Sen-
ate; we were preparing a defense au-
thorization bill. Even then we realized 
the threat that China and Chinese 
state-owned companies posed to our 
national security. We drafted amend-
ments to that year’s NDAA, blocking 
the purchase of Huawei-supplied equip-
ment. Indeed, we are still hearing 
about the need to block the purchase of 
Huawei equipment not only for us but 
for our allies. 
That action was 10 years ago, but 
China’s influence has continued to 
grow. What we have done is pretty 
much our part in the Senate to expose 
those bad actions, even as the rest of 
the world has allowed Beijing to co-opt 
the trappings of capitalism to perpet-
uate totalitarianism. 
Last year, we saw the people of Hong 
Kong rise up on behalf of democracy 
and self-determination. Indeed, to this 
day, that fight goes on even though the 
threats and fears of COVID–19 have 
caused those protesters to have to pro-
test in a different way. 
I cosponsored the Hong Kong Human 
Rights and Democracy Act and spon-
sored legislation prohibiting the com-
mercial export of covered munition 
items to the Hong Kong police force. 
But the world moves on, even as that 
standoff in Hong Kong continues. 
The Senate was forced to pen a reso-
lution asking the International Olym-
pic Committee to rebid the 2022 Winter 
Games to a country that respects 
human rights. That was really quite a 
bold move. It leaves me to wonder, why 
was China given this honor in the first 
place? I have to tell you, nobody seems 
to really know the answer to that ques-
tion. The aggression they display to-
ward Taiwan and Tibet and the out-
right repression of the Uighurs—this is 
something that has gone unchecked 
many times due to fear of economic re-
taliation. 
I have addressed this body several 
times on the subject of Huawei and 
China’s leveraging of the impending 5G 
rollout to create national security vul-
nerabilities in our network. Their ef-
forts to undermine our sovereignty are 
not limited to high-tech espionage. In-
deed, their goal is to place their equip-
ment everywhere. That is why it is so 
incredibly affordable to so many coun-
tries and so many of our allies. In plac-
ing this equipment, they are seeking to 
establish their own high-tech cyber spy 
network. We know what they are up to. 
This month, I introduced a bill to 
temper the influence of China-backed 
Confucius Institutes on American col-
lege campuses. We all have read the 
stories lately of how they have infil-
trated some of our institutions of high-
er learning and how they have co-opted 
some of the staff or professors. 
This is something that needs our at-
tention. It is followed on the heels of 
the Stop Higher Education Espionage 
and Theft Act—another effort to pre-
vent Beijing from increasing its hold 
on the minds of our younger genera-
tions. Time and again, we have called 
Chinese tech companies like Tik Tok 
onto the carpet for their censorship, 
their data collection, and their privacy 
practices—or 
lack 
of 
privacy, 
we 
should say. Yet content from their pop-
ular apps still dominates social media 
headlines. China’s hold on the global 
economy has never been more appar-
ent. 
Now there are reports that Beijing 
used the media and keyword censorship 
to suppress information about the 
coronavirus. Yet Beijing remains defi-
ant, attacking President Trump in 
tweets and accusing everyday Ameri-
cans of racism for daring to suggest 
that COVID–19 originated in Wuhan, 
China. They are, as many younger peo-
ple like to say, gaslighting us, and it is 
madness. 
It brings us to ask, when will enough 
be enough? We must not let our present 
concerns 
about 
the 
response 
to 
coronavirus deter us from thinking 
long term. This pandemic will change

our relationship with China in every 
single way. It is inevitable. Starting 
now, we must take advantage of this 
knowledge. As we think about an exit 
strategy from the coronavirus crisis, 
we have to think about this. As we 
think about a way forward to bring 
manufacturing back to the United 
States, we need to remember this. 
f 
SECURING AMERICA’S MEDICINE 
CABINET 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
have spoken several times about the 
vulnerabilities in our pharmaceutical 
supply chain and again encourage my 
colleagues to support the bipartisan 
Securing America’s Medicine Cabinet 
Act—or SAM-C Act—which I am spon-
soring alongside my colleague from 
New Jersey, Senator MENENDEZ. 
Without intervention, the FDA ex-
pects the pharmaceutical industry will 
continue to rely on Chinese companies 
to make the active pharmaceutical in-
gredients—or the APIs—that are nec-
essary for so many of our prescription 
and over-the-counter drugs. The threat 
it poses to our supply chain is real. 
On February 27, 2020, the FDA an-
nounced the shortage of one drug that 
is 
used 
to 
treat 
patients 
with 
coronavirus. They attributed the short-
age to difficulties obtaining the API 
from a site in China. That site has been 
affected by—guess what—coronavirus. 
We do not need to remain vulnerable. 
We need to realize that we are dealing 
with someone who has not been trans-
parent. They have hidden information 
from us. They are causing shortages of 
drugs and vaccines and antibiotics. It 
is time for us to learn from these les-
sons. If we ignore them, we do so at our 
own peril. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the opportunity to speak today in 
the wake of what is going on. 
I appreciate my colleague from Ten-
nessee talking about supply chains. I 
completely agree with her. It is some-
thing that we are going to have to seri-
ously look at as we get through this 
process. We have become too depend-
ent. I appreciate her efforts in that re-
gard. 
I want to talk today—I know we have 
a lot going on up here. For those who 
are watching and the American people, 
you need to understand that while this 
Gallery may be empty and this floor 
may be empty, there is a lot going on 
in the Senate right now. There is a lot 
happening to try to make sure that we 
save this economy, that we do those 
things necessary to try to make sure 
our businesses, our workers, and our 
economy from all sectors are saved. 
Again, I want to go back to the thing 
you can do as Americans, and that is to 
stop the spread of this virus. Do social 
distancing. Do those things we have 
talked about now for several weeks to 
try to get folks to do their part be-
cause we are trying to do our part. We 
are doing this in an incredibly bipar-
tisan effort. I think you will see a lot 
of things coming out of the Senate and 
out of the House, along with the ad-
ministration, to try to make sure we 
do those things for Americans. 
Over the past few weeks, I have 
talked with countless business owners 
and local and State officials. I have 
heard from a lot of folks who are 
scared to death, working folks who are 
now at home. They are not telecom-
muting because their jobs are not like 
that. They are alarmed about where we 
are today and where we are going to be 
tomorrow and next week and over the 
coming weeks and even potentially 
months. 
Businesses are having to lay off 
folks. They are having to furlough 
workers, sending a surge of folks to the 
unemployment line. We have seen that 
in just the last few days, which is 
something that, as we were moving, we 
thought we would not see. 
Small businesses, like restaurants 
and Main Street retailers, will go 
bankrupt if we are not careful. They 
are going to go bankrupt without cus-
tomers, as folks stay home and prac-
tice the social distancing that we know 
we have to do and as States start en-
acting forced closures of schools and 
events. Those businesses will shutter. 
Hopefully, it will only be a temporary 
shutting. 
First and foremost, there are steps 
we can all take to stop the spread of 
the virus and begin to get the economy 
on the right track. It is up to us indi-
vidually. In the meantime, we, as Mem-
bers of Congress and public officials 
across this country—from local county 
officials and city officials to the Gov-
ernors and State legislators and Mem-
bers of Congress—we have to do all we 
can to make sure our businesses, par-
ticularly the small businesses, which 
make up an overwhelming amount of 
business in the State of Alabama in 
particular, can continue to meet pay-
roll and keep workers paid so that they 
can then continue to meet their obliga-
tions. That is where my proposal comes 
in that I talked to a number of col-
leagues about. 
In addition to providing the same 
kind of direct assistance payments 
that are being kicked around now— 
whether it is through checks or in 
some form or another that people are 
widely talking about right now—I 
would also like to see a new fund that 
is created to quickly get cash into the 
hands of small businesses so they can 
make their payroll and not have to lay 
off workers. I am calling this the small 
business lifeline fund. It would provide 
a no-interest bridge loan for up to 3 
months, to be paid back over 5 years 
with no interest. This is a work-in- 
progress, so there are even proposals to 
make sure that this loan can be for-
given in certain circumstances. It 
could be administered through the 
Small 
Business 
Administration. 
It 
would offer loans up to 75 percent of a 
business’s last 3 months of payroll, 
with no one employee receiving more 
than $5,000. 
I want to repeat that because it 
would affect so many people in this 
country. It would offer loans up to 75 
percent of a business’s last 3 months of 
payroll, with no one employee receiv-
ing more than $5,000 per month. 
The key to this fund is, it would pass 
directly through the payroll compa-
nies. Payroll companies around this 
country are used by about 40 percent of 
American 
businesses. 
They 
mostly 
cater to the small businesses with 
fewer than 500 employees. Payroll com-
panies are in the best position to do 
this because they already have the in-
frastructure in place. They are a smart 
choice because they have payroll his-
tory. They have the employee data 
that makes this quick. It makes it effi-
cient. It uses the infrastructure and 
the pipelines that already exist with-
out having to go back and reinvent or 
create a new whole set of dynamics 
that may or may not work. We know 
the payroll company system in this 
country works. Again, 40 percent of 
folks use it. 
This process would help to alleviate 
the strain on our unemployment pro-
gram. It would be a seamless way to 
continue to pay workers, while also en-
suring that payroll taxes can continue 
to fund important programs, like Medi-
care, Medicaid, and Social Security. 
I want you to think about this. What 
we are talking about doing is not just 
a one-time $1,000 check or two-time 
$1,000 check; it is literally funding pay-
roll the way it exists—maybe only 75 
percent of it. But people who are used 
to 
getting 
those 
payroll 
checks 
through a payroll processor have their 
taxes deducted, they have their Social 
Security deducted, and they have their 
Medicaid and Medicare expenses de-
ducted. Those things would still come 
in. It is just that we have created a 
fund from the Federal Government to 
do that. Part of what we are fronting 
comes right back to the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
As part of this, we would also like to 
offer assistance to folks who are self- 
employed or run microbusinesses. Ac-
cording to IRS data, in 2017, there were 
some 26 million sole proprietorships in 
the United States. That is a lot of folks 
out there working hard, hustling every 
day to make their businesses—their lit-
tle piece of the American dream—suc-
cessful, but they don’t have the cash 
reserves to fall back on in times like 
these. We could carve this out and 
make sure they are taken care of in the 
short run. 
This is not the time, in my view, to 
shortchange the economy. This is not 
the time to send out just a check here 
and a check there—especially for those 
who are the most vulnerable to the cat-
aclysmic shocks we have seen in recent 
weeks. We have to be bold. We have to

be big. We need to act fast. We need to 
cut the bureaucracy. That is why using 
these payroll companies makes so 
much sense. 
Again, I want to emphasize that this 
is only one piece of this overall puzzle. 
It doesn’t cover everyone. It will not 
cover folks in the gig economy. We 
have to do other things to make sure 
unemployment insurance and other 
things are available to them in a simi-
lar fashion. But this is a big piece of 
the puzzle that can get money directly 
to folks. Their wages can get to folks— 
their wages can get to them right now 
so that if we also have to do things like 
forbearance on mortgages and rents, 
we don’t have to do it across the board 
because these folks will have the 
money to pay those mortgages and pay 
those rents and help those businesses 
stay afloat as well. The ripple effect of 
doing something like this, I believe, 
would be enormous. 
With this small business lifeline 
fund, we can send a message to folks on 
Main Street, who are the lifeblood of 
our communities. We can take this 
idea up and keep them afloat so they 
can get right back on track as soon as 
we get things back to normal. 
Right now, they need us. They need 
us in Congress. They need us at the 
local level, and they need us at the 
State level. 
I urge my colleagues to look at this 
very seriously—at this package that we 
are putting together and that we will, 
hopefully, get done in the next day or, 
hopefully, in hours—so we can all get 
back to our States and our families and 
do those things that are necessary. 
Keep in mind: I think folks will under-
stand that whatever we do in the next 
day or so will only be the next step. 
I mean, I don’t want anybody who is 
listening to anything any of us has to 
say to think that this is the end of it 
and that we are just going to finish our 
work and go home. We are going to 
have to monitor this constantly. We 
don’t know what the future holds in 
some aspects. So we will be back, if 
necessary, and, if necessary, we will do 
things differently. 
There are two other things I want to 
mention before I yield the floor, one of 
which I have talked about with regard 
to my State for a long time, and that 
is the need for Medicaid expansion. 
Alabama is one of those few States— 
I think out of 14 or 15 States—that did 
not expand Medicaid. As part of the 
package we are talking about now, we 
increase the Federal Government’s por-
tion of that and add additional Med-
icaid funds. For those States like Ala-
bama, we will get the extra benefits for 
sure, but we will not get as much as we 
should because we will not have ex-
panded Medicaid. 
Senator WARNER and I have a bill. It 
is called the SAME Act, or the States 
Achieve Medicaid Expansion Act. It is 
not mandatory. It does not make the 
States that haven’t achieved Medicaid 
expansion do that, but it gives them 
the same incentives they had a number 
of years ago. In a State like Alabama, 
some 300,000 people could get access to 
Medicaid who do not have insurance 
right now and cannot get it but who 
are wondering in our rural commu-
nities and everywhere in the State of 
Alabama: What in the world am I going 
to do if I catch this virus? Where am I 
going to go? 
Ultimately, with our hospitals, our 
doctors, and our safety nets that we 
are putting in as part of this package, 
we are going to have to cover it any-
way. We all know that, sooner or later, 
we are going to have to cover it. So I 
would love to see the SAME Act, or the 
States Achieve Medicaid Expansion 
Act, get out there and be a part of this 
package. Let States have the oppor-
tunity. It is a States’ rights issue. Not 
a single State would have to expand 
Medicaid if we pass this bill, but we 
would at least let those local leaders 
decide for themselves whether it would 
be time to give this opportunity to so 
many of the people in our States who 
are caught between Medicaid and jobs 
in which they are eligible for health in-
surance benefits. It would be a quick, 
easy way to make sure we are doing 
our part, and I urge that this be put in 
there. 
Finally, I have heard from so many 
people today who are in our under-
served communities in Alabama—the 
African-American 
community, 
the 
poor communities in Alabama. The 
preachers are calling, and the mayors 
are calling. I have been on the phone 
all day because they are concerned. It 
is not just that they are concerned be-
cause they don’t believe the State has 
them in mind, for I have talked to 
State officials in Alabama, and there 
are plans. 
The fact of the matter is that in this 
country, across the 50 States, we still 
don’t have enough tests, and we don’t 
have enough personal protection equip-
ment for my hospitals, for my testing 
labs, and for everybody in Alabama. It 
is just like in every other State. We are 
hurting, and we need those supplies. 
We are giving them money, and the 
States are doing a good job. Yet I want 
to make sure that, in Alabama and 
across this country, we don’t leave out 
the poorest of the poor; that we don’t 
leave out the underserved commu-
nities; and that we just don’t put test-
ing facilities in the big, urban areas— 
at the mega churches or the big hos-
pitals, like I have in Birmingham, 
which are awesome. We have to make 
sure that we have these clinics set up 
around the State, such as in the Black 
Belt of Alabama—the poorest of Ala-
bama’s counties—wherein people can’t 
drive an hour and a half or 2 hours to 
get tests. We have to make sure that 
we spread this out, because this disease 
is going to spread out. This disease is 
not just going to be concentrated in 
our urban areas. It is going to continue 
to spread. 
In these underserved areas in par-
ticular, families live together. Grand-
mothers take care of their grand-
children. Aunts and uncles take care of 
their nieces and nephews. They are all 
there together, and we have to figure 
out a way to protect them. We have to 
figure out a way to get those tests to 
them and to make sure that they are 
treated just as if they were part of our 
urban areas that have easier and ready 
access. 
I end with what I talked about the 
other day and with which I have ended 
so many of my talks, and that is back 
to the people of Alabama and the 
American people. 
I can assure you we are doing a lot up 
here. I see my friend from Alaska, who 
is presiding today. I know she has been 
working. I have watched her back here 
as she has worked the phones and 
talked to different people. Everywhere 
I go, I do see that Senators—most of 
us—are doing things by phone and are 
doing things remotely. Everybody is 
working the phones back in their 
States to make sure we do the right 
thing. 
Yet, at the end of the day, this is 
about you. This is about the people of 
America. Everyone in this country—to 
use a phrase from the old civil rights 
days in Birmingham, AL—is a foot sol-
dier in this movement. Everyone can 
do his part. We can appropriate money, 
and we can designate, and we can give 
tax breaks. We can do those things 
that are necessary that we as the Fed-
eral Government can do, but we can’t 
stop the spread of this virus. A U.S. 
Senator cannot stop the spread of this 
virus. We can only stop it among our-
selves. We can’t stop it across this 
country. Only you can do that. 
Only the foot soldiers in America— 
the hundreds of millions of people we 
have in this country—can stop the 
spread of the virus by heeding the 
warnings and by doing the things that 
are necessary with social distancing 
and washing their hands. I think my 
hands are just about raw since I have 
washed them so much. We are the foot 
soldiers. 
You are the foot soldiers. You can 
stop the spread. The other day, when I 
was here on the floor, I pulled out a 
picture of my old friend from my child-
hood, Smokey Bear, who said that only 
you can prevent forest fires. I talked 
about the fact that the coronavirus, 
the COVID–19 virus, is a forest fire 
across the country, and you can help to 
stop the spread. 
I want to be a little bit more patri-
otic about it today. I invoke one of my 
heroes who used this desk at one point, 
John F. Kennedy. It was 59 years ago 
when John F. Kennedy was sworn in as 
President of the United States and ut-
tered the famous words that sent such 
an emotion throughout America and 
that really got so many in this country 
to be patriotic and stand up for what 
we do. 
He said: ‘‘Ask not what your country 
can do for you—ask what you can do 
for your country.’’ 
That is what all Americans have to 
ask themselves today: What can I do 
for my country?

S1872 
March 20, 2020 
It is not like a day when we have a 
tornado that has ripped through, and 
you can go out and get a chain saw and 
help your neighbor. It is not like a day 
when a hurricane has come through, 
and you can go get bottles of water and 
diapers to send to folks. What you can 
do for your country today is to stop the 
spread of this virus. What you can do 
for your country is to try to stay home 
as much as you can—social distancing. 
Work those things. That is what you 
can do for your country. 
If you do that, yes, businesses are 
going to have problems. We know it. 
That is what we are trying to work 
on—making sure we provide that safe-
ty net and making sure we provide the 
necessary tools so that, if we can blunt 
that curve—if we can get past this— 
then we will come back even stronger. 
To get there, we have to have you. 
We have to have you stand up and 
speak out to everyone—to do your 
part, to do those things that are nec-
essary to make sure you do for your 
country what you should be doing. 
Help everyone in this country, and help 
everyone around you. When we do that, 
we will blunt this curve. We will make 
this the least severe as possible, and we 
will move forward and be stronger and 
better because, at the end of the day, 
we are the United States of America. 
I yield the floor.

f 
SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 549—DESIG-
NATING APRIL 2020 AS ‘‘SECOND 
CHANCE MONTH’’ 
Mr. PORTMAN (for himself and Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
S. RES. 549 
Whereas every individual is endowed with 
human dignity and value; 
Whereas redemption and second chances 
are values of the United States; 
Whereas millions of citizens of the United 
States have a criminal record; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of individ-
uals return to their communities from Fed-
eral and State prisons every year; 
Whereas individuals returning from Fed-
eral and State prisons have paid their debt 
for committing crimes but still face signifi-
cant legal and societal barriers (referred to 
in 
this 
preamble 
as 
‘‘collateral 
con-
sequences’’); 
Whereas collateral consequences for an in-
dividual returning from a Federal or State 
prison are mandatory and take effect auto-
matically, regardless of— 
(1) whether there is a nexus between the 
crime and public safety; 
(2) the seriousness of the crime; 
(3) the time that has passed since the indi-
vidual committed the crime; or 
(4) the efforts of the individual to make 
amends or earn back the trust of the public; 
Whereas, for individuals returning to their 
communities from Federal and State pris-
ons, gaining meaningful employment is one 
of the most significant predictors of success-
ful reentry and has been shown to reduce fu-
ture criminal activity; 
Whereas many individuals who have pre-
viously been incarcerated struggle to find 
employment 
because 
of 
collateral 
con-
sequences, which are often not directly re-
lated to the offenses the individuals com-
mitted or any proven public safety benefit; 
Whereas many States have laws that pro-
hibit an individual with a criminal record 
from working in certain industries or obtain-
ing professional licenses; 
Whereas, in addition to employment, edu-
cation has also been shown to be a signifi-
cant predictor of successful reentry for indi-
viduals returning from Federal and State 
prisons; 
Whereas an individual with a criminal 
record often has a lower level of educational 
attainment than the general population and 
has significant difficulty acquiring admis-
sion to, and funding for, educational pro-
grams; 
Whereas an individual who has been con-
victed of certain crimes is often barred from 
receiving the financial aid necessary to ac-
quire additional skills and knowledge; 
Whereas an individual with a criminal 
record— 
(1) faces collateral consequences in secur-
ing a place to live; and 
(2) is often barred from seeking access to 
public housing; 
Whereas collateral consequences prevent 
millions of individuals in the United States 
from contributing fully to their families and 
communities; 
Whereas collateral consequences can con-
tribute to recidivism, which increases crime 
and victimization and decreases public safe-
ty; 
Whereas the inability to find gainful em-
ployment and other collateral consequences 
of conviction inhibit the economic mobility 
of an individual with a criminal record, 
which can negatively impact the well-being 
of the children and families of the individual 
for generations; 
Whereas the bipartisan First Step Act of 
2018 (Public law 115–391) was signed into law 
on December 21, 2018, to increase opportuni-
ties for individuals incarcerated in Federal 
prisons to participate in meaningful recidi-
vism reduction programs and prepare for 
their second chances; 
Whereas the programs authorized by the 
Second Chance Act of 2007 (Public Law 110– 
199)— 
(1) have provided reentry services to more 
than 164,000 individuals in 49 States and the 
District of Columbia since the date of enact-
ment of the Act; and 
(2) were reauthorized by the First Step Act 
of 2018 (Public law 115–391); 
Whereas the anniversary of the death of 
Charles Colson, who used his second chance 
following his incarceration for a Watergate- 
related crime to found Prison Fellowship, 
the largest program in the United States 
that provides outreach to prisoners, former 
prisoners, and their families, falls on April 
21; and 
Whereas the designation of April as ‘‘Sec-
ond Chance Month’’ may contribute to— 
(1) increased public awareness about— 
(A) 
the 
impact 
of 
collateral 
con-
sequences; and 
(B) the need for closure for individuals 
with a criminal record who have paid their 
debt; and 
(2) opportunities for individuals, employ-
ers, congregations, and communities to ex-
tend second chances to those individuals: 
Now, therefore, be it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1876 
March 20, 2020 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates April 2020 as ‘‘Second Chance 
Month’’; 
(2) honors the work of communities, gov-
ernmental institutions, nonprofit organiza-
tions, congregations, employers, and individ-
uals to remove unnecessary legal and soci-
etal barriers that prevent individuals with 
criminal records from becoming productive 
members of society; and 
(3) calls upon the people of the United 
States to observe Second Chance Month 
through actions and programs that— 
(A) promote awareness of those unneces-
sary legal and social barriers; and 
(B) provide closure for individuals with a 
criminal record who have paid their debt.

AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND 
PROPOSED 
SA 1561. Mr. MORAN submitted an amend-
ment intended to be proposed by him to the

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 1561. Mr. MORAN submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed by 
him to the bill S. 3548, to provide emer-
gency assistance and health care re-
sponse for individuals, families, and 
businesses 
affected 
by 
the 
2020 
coronavirus pandemic; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Finance; as 
follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. COVERAGE FOR ALLERGY DIAGNOSTIC 
TESTING SERVICES UNDER MEDI-
CARE AND MEDICAID. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Allergies, when not properly diagnosed, 
cannot be effectively treated. 
(2) Allergies to food, inhaled particles, or 
other sources can cause debilitating and, in 
some cases, fatal reactions. 
(3) Allergies can substantially compound 
other illnesses, including asthma, emphy-
sema, and adult obstructive pulmonary dis-
eases, leading to social and economic costs 
for families and our Nation’s health care sys-
tem. 
(4) According to clinical guidelines from 
the National Institutes of Health and rec-
ommendations 
from 
peer-reviewed 
lit-
erature, in vitro specific IgE tests and 
percutaneous tests are considered equivalent 
as confirmatory tests in terms of their sensi-
tivity and accuracy. 
(5) Despite these recommendations, some 
current Medicare local coverage determina-
tions and Medicaid coverage policies deny 
equal access to in vitro specific IgE tests and 
percutaneous tests. 
(6) 
In 
vitro 
specific 
IgE 
tests
