prayer: 
With the psalmist, we give thanks to 
You, O Lord, for You are good. Your 
love endures forever. 
As we consider the 80th anniversary 
of the WAVES, the Women Accepted 
for 
Volunteer 
Emergency 
Service, 
signed into law July 30, 1942, remind us 
again of the long-lasting and vital im-
pact decisions made in these Chambers 
truly have in defense of this country 
and for the welfare of its future. 
Celebrating the innumerable con-
tributions these first women made on 
intelligence, 
communications, 
and 
cryptology, to name a few, we give You 
our gratitude that You have put before 
this body critical opportunities to le-
verage the gifts and graces of all our 
fellow Americans for the common 
good. 
May their experience of fortitude and 
resilience, faith and devotion to our 
country, in war and in peace, serve as 
a testimony of how You respond in 
times of trouble, how You deliver us 
from distress. Even now, You still the 
storms that rage to a whisper and bring 
the waves that roar to a hush. 
Lord, we have seen the works of Your 
hands and Your wonderful deeds. Let 
those who are wise heed the history of 
Your faithfulness, and may we ponder 
Your loving deeds. We offer ourselves 
and our prayers for Your service. 
Amen.

Let us pray. 
Eternal God, our hearts are steadfast 
for You. Though evil sometimes seems 
to prosper, we trust You to cause jus-
tice to prevail. In these turbulent 
times, our hope is in Your goodness 
that continues to sustain us. 
Today, give our Senators the ability 
to realize more fully that they are 
servants of Heaven. As good servants, 
give them Your perspective on their 
daily tasks and decisions. In faithful-
ness to You, provide the litmus test by 
which they evaluate each decision. 
Lord, give our lawmakers such integ-

We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.

FLOODING IN KENTUCKY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, we 
learn more each day about the dev-
astating toll that ongoing flooding has 
inflicted on Eastern Kentucky. As res-
cue and recovery efforts continue, Ken-
tuckians are grieving lost family mem-
bers and friends and neighbors. 
One of the victims of last weekend’s 
flash floods was Gabe Hensley, a 30- 
year-old coal miner and father. Gabe 
was working a shift when the floods 
hit. On his way home to rescue his wife 
and son, he stopped to help a man who 
had wrecked a four-wheeler. He cleared 
trees and turned people away from dan-
ger. Then, tragically, the floodwaters 
swept Gabe away. 
As Gabe’s cousin told the Herald- 
Leader yesterday, ‘‘Eastern Kentucky 
lost a hero.’’ 
We are all grieving for the men, 
women, and children this flood has 
taken from us. The Hensley family has 
asked that people honor Gabe by help-
ing other flood victims. Flooding, high 
winds, and power outages are still on-
going, and forecasters predict more 
heavy rainfall in the region throughout 
next week. The threat of even more 
disaster in Eastern Kentucky is acute. 
I spoke with the Governor, State leg-
islative leaders, and officials on the 
ground in Eastern Kentucky yesterday. 
They echoed the need for food, cleaning 
supplies, and water. 
In such dire times, the ray of hope is 
the fact that generous Kentuckians 
from across the Commonwealth are 
hearing these calls for help and answer-
ing loud and clear. Already, the East-
ern Kentucky relief fund has received 
about $2.3 million in charitable dona-
tions. Across my home State, from the 
Winchester VWF to neighborhood res-
taurants in Northern Kentucky, locals 
are organizing donation drives. The 
University of Kentucky and the Uni-
versity of Louisville’s men’s basketball 
teams are both fundraising for flood re-
lief, 
and 
police 
departments 
from 
around the region donated cruisers to 
help with search and rescue. 
All this generosity will play a crucial 
role as we begin to rebuild. As the offi-
cials I spoke to emphasized, it will be a 
long road ahead for the families af-
fected by these awful floods. But I 
know I speak for every Kentuckian 
when I say: We will be with them every 
single step of the way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3838 
August 2, 2022 
days rolling out their latest reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree. It turns out 
that proposing huge, job-killing tax 
hikes and more runaway spending dur-
ing inflation and a recession doesn’t go 
over very well. Here are a few of the 
things 
nonpartisan—nonpartisan—ex-
perts have already proven about the 
Democrats’ proposal. 
No. 1, the so-called Inflation Reduc-
tion Act would actually increase infla-
tion in the short term and do nothing 
to tackle the problem in the long term. 
That is from the University of Pennsyl-
vania. 
No. 2, their tax hikes would shatter 
President Biden’s promise not to im-
pact households earning below $400,000. 
Many billions of dollars of the new tax 
hikes would fall—listen to this—di-
rectly on the working class and the 
middle class. That, of course, is not 
from Republicans but from the Joint 
Committee on Taxation. 
No. 3, also from the Joint Committee 
on Taxation, fully half of the Demo-
crats’ 
$300-plus 
billion—billion—new 
tax on American jobs would come 
crashing down on American manufac-
turers in particular—manufacturers in 
particular. 
Now, those groups that I cited are 
neutral and nonpartisan. But, just for 
fun, let’s take a look at the most favor-
able numbers—most favorable num-
bers—for Democrats. Let’s look at 
their own spin. 
One of the Biden administration’s fa-
vorite outside economists, somebody 
who has consistently been overopti-
mistic about inflation and Democrats’ 
policies, claims their bill will reduce 
the Consumer Price Index by a grand 
total—listen to this—of one-third of 1 
percent—one-third of 1 percent—be-
tween now and the end of the year 
2031—wow—0.33 percent over 9 years. 
That is one twenty-eighth of the infla-
tion Democrats have caused in just the 
last 12 months. For goodness’ sake, 
Democrats added four times that much 
inflation just in the month of June 
alone. 
So, listen, the friendliest estimate 
for Democrats says their taxing-and- 
spending spree would take 9 years—9 
years—to unwind literally 1 week’s 
worth of recent inflation. Hundreds of 
billions of dollars in tax hikes, hun-
dreds of billions of dollars in new 
spending, and it would take 9 years to 
remove 1 week’s worth of Democrats’ 
inflation—goodness. 
So let me repeat it one more time. 
This is the most generous estimate for 
Democrats. Neutral experts like the 
University of Pennsylvania say even 
this is too optimistic, and their bill 
would actually make inflation even 
worse in the coming months. 
So, look, this isn’t an Inflation Re-
duction Act—not even close. It is just a 
catalog of tax hikes and green boon-
doggles that Democrats have wanted, 
literally, for years with a false new 
label slapped on the front. The Infla-
tion Reduction Act won’t reduce infla-
tion any more than the American Res-
cue Plan actually rescued America. 
The Inflation Reduction Act won’t 
reduce inflation any more than the 
American Rescue Plan actually rescued 
America. The only thing the so-called 
rescue plan rescued the country from 
was stable prices and a functioning 
economy. And the only thing their in-
flation reduction plan will reduce is 
American jobs, wages, after-tax in-
comes, energy affordability, and new 
lifesaving medicines. Wow. What an ac-
complishment. 
So the Democrats say they need to 
pass another massive economic failure 
because their first huge economic fail-
ure has made it necessary. Well, the 
American people see things quite dif-
ferently. 
TAIWAN 
Mr. President, now on one final mat-
ter, public reports indicate the Speaker 
of the House just landed in Taiwan as 
she travels through Asia. I believe she 
has every right to go, and it has been 
unseemly and counterproductive for 
President Biden and his aides to have 
publicly sought to deter her from doing 
so. 
There is significant precedent for 
high-ranking 
U.S. 
officials 
visiting 
Taiwan, including a past Speaker of 
the House. Beijing claims such a visit 
is now unacceptable. They claim that 
things have changed. Well, it is cer-
tainly true China has stepped up its ag-
gressive actions. They are trying to 
change the status quo through force. 
They have expanded militarily in the 
South China Sea. They have invested 
in anti-ship and anti-aircraft capabili-
ties to threaten U.S. vessels. They have 
manipulated and threatened neighbors 
and mounted an all-out assault on de-
mocracy and autonomy in Hong Kong. 
Now Beijing wants to dictate Tai-
wan’s future to its people and snuff out 
the island’s democracy, and they are 
building the military capacity to actu-
ally bring that about. That is what is 
provocative. And to hear those respon-
sible for this aggression complain— 
complain—that Speaker PELOSI’s trav-
el itinerary is provocative is utterly 
absurd. 
So I welcome the Speaker’s display of 
support for Taiwan’s democracy, but I 
hope she returns from Asia more mind-
ful of the military dimensions of the 
Chinese threat and more committed to 
working with Republicans to address 
the changing balance of military power 
in the region. What that requires is 
selling the right mix of weapons to Tai-
wan on a prompt timeline, while help-
ing Taiwan’s military prepare for like-
ly threats. 
The Biden administration has had 2 
years to build on the robust invest-
ments their immediate predecessors 
made in military modernization. In-
stead, they submitted defense budget 
requests that pointed in the completely 
wrong direction. While China keeps 
ramping up, the Biden administration 
proposed to actually cut—cut—our de-
fense spending after inflation. 
So when Congress debates the De-
fense authorization and appropriations 
bills, we must address national secu-
rity challenges in the Indo-Pacific 
head-on. And I hope the Speaker’s trav-
els will mean that we do so with more 
of a bipartisan consensus on American 
might than we have seen in the recent 
past. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, over 
the last 5 days, we have seen what 
President Biden and a Democratic-led 
Congress are focused on getting done: 
bringing terrorists to justice, lowering 
costs, reducing inflation and the def-
icit, helping out our veterans, and bet-
ter competing with countries like 
China. 
I want to begin with a word on last 
night’s strike. Last night, President 
Biden reported that the United States 
conducted a strike that targeted and 
killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the noto-
rious mass murderer, the leader of al- 
Qaida, and one of the sick planners of 
the September 11 attacks, which in 
New York and around the country and 
the world we are still mourning. 
The strike against al-Zawahiri is a 
major victory for the United States. It 
will make our country and the entire 
world a safer place. It will also help 
bring an element of justice for the 9/11 
families, as well as the many Ameri-
cans who still carry the scars deep 
within. 
I applaud President Biden for bring-
ing final justice to this loathsome mur-
derer who orchestrated the killing of 
thousands of my fellow New Yorkers, 
including some people I knew quite 
well. I also want to thank the Presi-
dent’s national security team for keep-
ing Congress fully and currently in-
formed throughout the process. Fi-
nally, I want to applaud the skill and 
bravery of our dedicated intelligence 
community, servicemembers, and dip-
lomats who work day and night—day 
and night—to keep America safe. 
This successful mission will send a 
chill down the spines of terrorists all 
over the world and likewise will send a 
clear message to those who wish to 
cross our Nation and harm our citizens: 
You will find no comfort. You will find 
no quarter. You can run, but you can’t 
hide. We will hunt you down to the 
ends of the Earth until justice is car-
ried out.

unthinkable: fight for basic healthcare 
benefits they rightfully deserve. 
Two months ago, the Senate over-
whelmingly passed this bill that se-
cured the largest healthcare benefit ex-
pansion for our veterans in decades. We 
are dealing by and large with that 
exact bill again, so there is no jus-
tification to delay swift passage of the 
PACT Act any longer. 
I am very hopeful that Republicans 
can work with Democrats to break 
through the impasse on the PACT Act 
immediately. We have offered Senator 
PAUL and Senator TOOMEY votes on the 
amendments they have been calling 
for, set at a 60-vote threshold, just like 
the cloture vote has a 60-vote thresh-
old. We hope to reach an agreement 
where we can act on this bill as soon as 
today, but for that to happen, our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
should work with us in good faith. 
There is no better message we can 
send to the veterans who have camped 
out for nights in front of the Capitol 
than that their long wait and the wait 
of veterans everywhere is finally over. 
These brave Americans risked life and 
limb to keep our country safe, and the 
very least we can do is ensure they re-
ceive top care. 
I urge my colleagues to come to-
gether so we can get the PACT Act 
done ASAP, as soon as today. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. President, now on the Inflation 
Reduction Act of 2022, the Senate is on 
track 
to 
consider 
passing 
the 
groundbreaking and truly historic In-
flation Reduction Act later this week. 
I want to thank the Office of the Sen-
ate Parliamentarian and all of the 
committee staff on both sides of the 
aisle for their tireless work on the 
Byrd bath process that is currently un-
derway. All text and CBO and JCT 
scores have been submitted for review 
in this process. The Parliamentarian 
and her team have dedicated long 
hours on our legislation, and I think I 
can speak for all Senators in thanking 
them for their work. We are on sched-
ule to consider this bill later this week. 
The more that people learn about 
what is in the Inflation Reduction Act, 
the more they find reasons to praise 
the bill and the more absurd the Re-
publican attacks sound. 
This morning, a group of 126 leading 
economists—including 7 Nobel Prize 
winners, 3 former Chairs of the Council 
of Economic Advisers, and 2 former 
Treasury Secretaries—wrote a letter to 
congressional leaders calling for swift 
passage of our bill. They found that our 
bill ‘‘will fight inflation and lower 
costs for American families while set-
ting the stage for strong, stable, and 
broadly-shared 
long-term 
economic 
growth.’’ 
That is seven Nobel laureates, three 
former Chairs of the CEA, two former 
Treasury Secretaries. Let me read it 
again. This bill will ‘‘fight inflation 
and lower costs for American families 
while setting the stage for strong, sta-
ble, 
broadly-shared 
long-term 
eco-
nomic growth.’’ 
Another analysis from the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et—hardly 
a 
liberal 
organization— 
began with the headline that: 
The Inflation Reduction Act will HELP 
FIGHT INFLATION. 
They believe it is aptly named. It is. 
The headlines go on and on and speak 
for themselves. 
The New York Times—this is a head-
line: 
Analysis Deems Biden’s Climate and Tax 
Bill Fiscally Responsible. 
CNN: 
Top economists say Democrats’ health 
care and climate package will put ‘‘down-
ward pressure on inflation.’’ 
The Hill: 
Economists say reconciliation bill will 
lower prices for all Americans. 
These are just a few examples out of 
many. They join right alongside other 
voices like that of former Treasury 
Secretary Larry Summers, the Repub-
lican leader’s favorite inflation expert, 
who said our bill is ‘‘directly fighting 
the rate of inflation.’’ 
They join voices like that of Mark 
Zandi, Moody’s top economist and 
former 
adviser 
to 
Senator 
John 
McCain, who said that our bill would 
have a ‘‘material beneficial economic 
impact’’ 
and 
‘‘will 
push 
inflation 
lower.’’ 
Taken together, these voices say the 
same thing: The Inflation Reduction 
Act will lower costs, fight inflation, 
and secure historic wins in the fight 
against climate change. 
Now, Republicans have spent the last 
few days launching the same stale, pre-
dictable, and alarmist attacks they use 
against virtually any Democratic pro-
posal, regardless of the facts. They 
claim that our bill is some crazy tax 
hike for the vast majority of Ameri-
cans. Balderdash. This is the Repub-
lican bunk. They want to only help the 
rich when it comes to taxes. And when 
we do something against the rich, they 
howl. 
Our bill does not increase any taxes 
for small businesses and families mak-
ing under $400,000 a year. Let me say 
that again. Our bill does not increase 
any taxes for small businesses and fam-
ilies making under $400,000 a year. 
What we will do is close loopholes that 
the largest businesses in this country 
have long abused to bring their tax 
rate down, sometimes to nothing. If 
nurses and firefighters and teachers 
pay their fair share of taxes, so, too, 
should megacorporations. Americans 
don’t think that is crazy. It is just 
common sense. 
Here is the truth. Republicans will 
say anything to smear our proposal be-
cause they know they are on the wrong 
side of many of the issues our bill 
would solve. 
Republicans know they are on the 
wrong side of taxes after the American 
people rejected their sweeping boon-
doggle of a tax bill that overwhelm-
ingly went to the wealthy and the larg-
est corporations. 
Republicans know they are on the 
wrong side of healthcare and prescrip-
tion drug reform after spending years 
trying 
to 
repeal 
healthcare 
while 
cozying up to Big Pharma. Republicans 
don’t have good answers for a bill that 
will finally bring drug costs down. 
And Republicans know they are on 
the wrong side of the climate debate. 
This bill is going to make the biggest 
investments in clean energy ever, 
which will not only reduce emissions 
by roughly 40 percent but will also help 
prevent nearly 4,000 needless deaths 
and 100,000 asthma attacks each year. 
Republicans, who have bowed down for 
years to our Nation’s biggest polluters, 
know they have little credibility with 
the American people when it comes to 
climate. 
The American people do not want to 
hear the same fearmongering over and 
over again from Republicans. They ac-
tually want us to take steps to bring 
costs down. They want us to preserve 
our planet for future generations. They 
want to make sure everyone plays by 
the same rules on taxes and everything 
else. They want to have high-quality 
healthcare without worrying about 
going bankrupt. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is going 
to take meaningful steps on all these 
issues, and Democrats will pass the bill 
in the coming days. 
I yield the floor. 
NOMINATION OF ELIZABETH WILSON HANES 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, 
the Senate will consider another highly 
qualified judicial nominee to the Fed-
eral bench. We will vote to confirm 
Judge Elizabeth Hanes to the Eastern 
District of Virginia. 
Judge Hanes currently serves as a 
U.S. magistrate judge in the Eastern 
District of Virginia, a position to 
which she was appointed by the current 
judges of the district court in 2020. She 
has already issued 100 opinions during 
her time on the bench. 
A lifelong Virginian, Judge Hanes 
has deep ties to the Eastern District. 
She was born in Roanoke, VA, and at-
tended the University of Richmond and 
the University of Richmond School of 
Law. After graduating, she clerked for 
Judge Joseph R. Goodwin on the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern Dis-
trict of West Virginia and for Judge 
Robert B. King on the Fourth Circuit. 
Judge Hanes began her career in pub-
lic service as an assistant federal pub-
lic defender in the Office of the Federal 
Public Defender for the Eastern Dis-
trict of Virginia, a role she held for 7 
years. She then joined Consumer Liti-
gation Associates in Richmond. Judge 
Hanes gained significant trial experi-
ence during this time. And throughout 
her time in legal practice, she rep-
resented indigent defendants in crimi-
nal matters and low-income clients— 
including veterans—in civil claims re-
lated to predatory lending practices. 
Judge Hanes received a ‘‘qualified’’ 
rating from the American Bar Associa-
tion and has the strong support of Vir-
ginia’s Senators, Mr. WARNER and Mr.

KAINE. With her depth of experience 
and proven commitment to equal jus-
tice, Judge Hanes will continue to 
serve the Eastern District of Virginia 
with distinction. And importantly, as a 
former public defender, she will bring 
vital professional diversity to the Fed-

I urge my colleagues to join me in

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
is my first day back in the Senate 
since I contracted COVID last week. It 
is good to be back, particularly for a 
historic week. I am grateful to the 
healthcare professionals and brilliant 
scientists who developed the COVID 
vaccines and therapies so quickly and 
am thankful for the Federal funding 
that made their work possible. Luck-
ily, I am double-vaxxed and double- 
boosted, and I encourage everyone: Get 
your shots. 
AYMAN AL-ZAWAHIRI 
Madam President, at 6:18 a.m. this 
past Sunday morning, in a wealthy 
neighborhood in Kabul, Afghanistan, 
two U.S. Hellfire missiles delivered jus-
tice—at 
last—to 
al-Qaida 
leader 
Ayman 
al-Zawahiri. 
Al-Zawahiri 
is 
dead, and the world is better for it. He 
was a terrible man who brought hor-
rific suffering to countless numbers of 
people, innocent people, throughout 
the world. 
He was second in command to Osama 
bin Laden during 9/11, which claimed 
nearly 3,000 innocent American lives. 
He was the mastermind behind the 
bombings of the U.S. Embassies in 
Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and behind 
the bombing of the USS Cole in the 
Yemeni port in 2000. He claimed to act 
on behalf of Islam; yet his hands were 
stained with the blood of innocence, in-
cluding of countless Muslims. 
Since the death of bin Laden 11 years 
ago, Zawahiri has been the leader of al- 
Qaida. He has been rumored variously 
to be hiding in the tribal areas of Paki-
stan and Afghanistan. He was finally 
discovered living with his family in a 
wealthy neighborhood in the center of 
Kabul. 
The U.S. intelligence community and 
the CIA deserve great credit for their 
careful, professional work over months 
to verify Zawahiri’s location and iden-
tity. President Biden also deserves 
credit. At least three U.S. Presidents 
hunted down this man. Joe Biden’s ad-
ministration finally succeeded in rid-
ding the world of this terrible person. 
The war in Afghanistan was Amer-
ica’s longest war by far—20 bloody 
years. Donald Trump, before he left of-
fice, set the deadline to end that war— 
a decision that Joe Biden inherited and 
America completed 1 year ago this 
month. I supported that decision to 
withdraw the troops from Afghanistan. 
At the same time, President Biden and 
military leaders warned extremists not 
to confuse the withdrawal of American 
boots on the ground with any reduction 
of our commitment to the fight against 
terrorism. 
The death of Zawahiri is proof that 
those who harm U.S. citizens, U.S. 
troops, and U.S. interests will find no 
safe quarter in this world. 
PACT ACT OF 2022 
Madam President, you don’t have to 
go to Ground Zero in New York or to 
the 
Pentagon 
or 
to 
the 
field 
in 
Shanksville, PA, to see the reminders 
of the terrible suffering that came out 
of 9/11; you can walk outside of the 
Senate Chamber and see Iraq and Af-
ghanistan veterans and their families, 
who still bear the scars of war. 
For years, they and many others 
have urged the Veterans Health Ad-
ministration 
to 
finally 
provide 
healthcare for the veterans who were 
exposed to toxic burn pits and other 
forms of deadly toxic pollution during 
their service. 
Last Thursday, many of these vet-
erans traveled to Washington. They 
came here to see a celebration—the 
passage of the PACT Act—and Presi-
dent Biden promised to sign it. It is a 
critical bill designed to provide VA 
health services for 3.5 million toxic-ex-
posed veterans. Instead of a celebra-
tion, they witnessed a betrayal. At the 
last minute, 25 Republican Senators, 
who had just voted for the PACT Act 6 
weeks earlier, voted against it. They 
voted 
against 
giving 
toxic-exposed 
military veterans the VA healthcare 
they deserved. 
Since then, these veterans, their fam-
ily members, and supporters have been 
holding a vigil—what they call a fire 
watch—on the steps of the Capitol. 
They have remained there through rain 
and steaming heat to remind us of our 
duty to help them. 
Veterans across this Nation and some 
out on the steps are sick and dying 
with cancer and other disorders be-
cause they were exposed to burn pits, 
Agent Orange, and other chemical poi-
sons. These are wounds of war, and 
they should be treated that way. Vet-
erans who have risked their lives for 
our freedom must not be treated as col-
lateral damage in a political skirmish. 
JON TESTER, the chairman of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, has shown 
real leadership on this. JON states it 
ever so simply, and I think we should 
all remember: We have to face the real 
costs of war. We talk about our annual 
budgets. We talk about the body 
counts. We talk about all of the issues 
that face us, but we face the reality 
that those who served in our wars come 
home many times with physical but 
often invisible scars that haunt them 
for a lifetime. Those are the real costs 
of war. This bill, the PACT Act, which 
JON
TESTER
and Senator MORAN
of 
Kansas brought to this floor, addressed 
those costs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3841 
August 2, 2022 
It is time for us to get it right in the 
U.S. Senate. There is a rumor on the 
floor that there may be an agreement 
that even today we are going to vote 
on this. None too soon. Those veterans 
who are waiting on the steps deserve it. 
Millions at home are watching this— 
and their families and others who love 
them—in the hopes that what we do on 
the floor of the Senate will finally give 
them some comfort in their lives. The 
Senate must hold another vote on the 
PACT Act, and I hope it will be today. 
That is the rumor on the floor. 
Let’s get it right this time. Let’s re-
assemble that bipartisan coalition that 
passed the bill originally. Let’s restore 
the faith of the veterans community 
and many Americans in the U.S. Sen-
ate. On a bipartisan basis, we can stand 
up for those who stood up and served 
our Nation. 
JANUARY 6 
On another matter, Madam Presi-
dent, 
the 
last 
several 
days 
have 
brought a stream of troubling revela-
tions about the disappearance of Secret 
Service and Department of Homeland 
Security text messages from around 
the time of the deadly January 6, 2021, 
insurrection on this Capitol. The miss-
ing texts could provide critical evi-
dence about one of the worst crimes 
and greatest threats to our Constitu-
tion ever perpetrated on America. The 
disappearance of this critical informa-
tion could jeopardize the efforts to 
learn the full truth of January 6 and 
hold responsible anyone who planned 
and participated in that attack. 
I don’t know whether the failure to 
preserve 
these 
critical 
government 
texts of January 6 is a result of bad 
faith or stunning incompetence, but I 
do know that the man who has over-
seen this fiasco is not the right person 
to investigate it. This man has lost 
whatever credibility he may have once 
had on this matter. That is why I have 
asked Attorney General Merrick Gar-
land to step in and take control of this 
investigation into the missing texts. 
This is what we know so far: Joseph 
Cuffari was nominated to be inspector 
general for the Department of Home-
land Security by former President Don-
ald Trump. He remains in that position 
today. The Department of Homeland 
Security includes the Secret Service 
and many other critical government 
Agencies. Inspectors general are sup-
posed to be independent watchdogs for 
their Departments and make sure that 
the people working in that Department 
don’t engage in waste, fraud, or abuse. 
If there is any problem, the inspector 
general is required by law to report it 
to Congress. 
In recent weeks, we learned belatedly 
from Mr. Cuffari, this inspector gen-
eral, that, No. 1, his office asked the 
Secret Service last February for text 
messages, emails, and other records 
that could shed light on January 6, and 
he was met with months—months—of 
delay and stonewalling. 
Mr. Cuffari has known since at least 
February of this year that the Secret 
Service texts from January 6 had been 
erased in supposedly routine resets of 
the Agency’s phones. 
Imagine 
that—Agencies 
entrusted 
with the security of the United States 
and when there is a handoff of official 
phones, they are erased at that time. 
Mr. Cuffari did not share that infor-
mation with Congress for 5 months—5 
months. 
Mr. Cuffari also belatedly informed 
Congress that texts from the cell 
phones of the top two leaders in the 
Department of Homeland Security dur-
ing the insurrection, Acting Secretary 
Chad Wolf and Acting Deputy Sec-
retary Ken Cuccinelli, were apparently 
lost during another reset after they 
turned in their government phones. 
Imagine the fumbling of critical in-
formation about an event as historic as 
the January 6 Trump insurrectionist 
mob who invaded this Capitol. 
According to public reports, Depart-
ment staff actually came up with a 
plan to retrieve the deleted emails 
when they first learned about them. 
Listen to this: Mr. Cuffari’s office 
inexplicably killed the plan. 
This isn’t just another government 
Agency we are talking about, as impor-
tant as that would be; the Department 
of Homeland Security has some of the 
most sophisticated intelligence and in-
vestigative capabilities not just in the 
United States but in the world. It is 
hard to believe that this Department 
accidentally deleted texts that could 
shed light on one of the greatest con-
stitutional events and crimes ever 
committed in the history of the United 
States, but it would be just as problem-
atic if they did. Either way, we need to 
get to the bottom of this. 
This month, after news of the miss-
ing texts became public and his office 
came under criticism, Mr. Cuffari be-
latedly opened a criminal investigation 
into the Secret Service’s missing text 
messages. It was the right thing to do, 
but he is the wrong person to do it. Mr. 
Cuffari has lost his credibility. 
The same law that allows Mr. Cuffari 
to conduct this criminal investigation, 
the Inspector General Act, gives to the 
Attorney General of the United States 
the power to take control of it. It is 
time for Attorney General Garland to 
step in and oversee this investigation 
with impartial professionalism that 
justice and history demand. 
CRYPTOCURRENCY 
Madam President, it was February 
when I was watching the Super Bowl 
with my family at home. I noticed 
something that was odd. There was 
LeBron James on TV. In a commercial, 
he tells a younger version of himself: 
‘‘If you want to make history, you 
gotta call your own shots.’’ He was pro-
moting crypto.com, a cryptocurrency 
exchange based in Singapore. 
Soon after, one of my favorite come-
dians appeared on the screen, Larry 
David. His ad had a similar note. He 
warned viewers not to ‘‘miss out on 
crypto.’’ That ad was sponsored by a 
different crypto exchange that was 
headquartered in the Bahamas. 
I saw these ads and thought to my-
self, What is going on here? This is a 
football game. Both companies were 
just a few years old, and 30-second ads 
cost millions of dollars—$7 million, I 
understand. I can’t imagine enlisting 
LeBron James and Larry David for 
that purpose. So how exactly can these 
exchanges that most Americans have 
never heard of afford to shell out tens 
of millions of dollars on Super Bowl 
ads? Better yet, why? 
Last week, National Public Radio ran 
a story that helped answer my ques-
tion. You see, these crypto companies 
weren’t simply promoting their prod-
ucts; they were trying to create a ve-
neer of credibility. These Super Bowl 
ads were high-stakes attempts to con-
vince hard-working Americans into in-
vesting in a volatile, unwieldy, and 
poorly regulated asset class called 
cryptocurrency. 
Unfortunately, 
it 
seems to be working. 
Let me tell you about Michelle 
Milkowski. She lives in Washington 
State. She watched the same ads I did 
during the Super Bowl. She shared her 
story with National Public Radio. 
When Michelle saw celebrities pro-
moting crypto products, she said it 
convinced her that ‘‘[it’s] not just 
scammers [that] are using [them]. . . . 
[I] felt safe . . . to put my money in 
there.’’ So how did Michelle’s crypto 
investment pan out? Well, 3 months 
after the Super Bowl, she was down 
$8,000. She was another victim of the 
crypto market meltdown that began in 
May. 
For the record, in the course of 24 
hours, more than $200 billion of value 
in the crypto industry vanished. And, 
just last week, the industry lost more 
than 5 percent of its value—again, in 1 
day. 
These 
rapid 
losses 
convinced 
Michelle to cash out. How does she feel 
about her crypto experience today? She 
said: 
There’s definitely peace that comes with 
. . . selling off such a volatile asset . . . I 
don’t have to worry [every day] am I losing 
. . . [another] thousand dollars . . . 
Michelle was lucky she was able to 
wash her hands and cut her losses, but, 
Madam President, for the majority of 
Americans who cannot afford even a 
$1,000 emergency, losing $8,000 in 3 
months is a disaster. That is the dif-
ference between paying your rent and 
living on the street. 
Look, if you are a retail investor 
with money to invest and you want to 
try your hand at the crypto casino, by 
all means, grab your chips and head to 
the tables—within reason. But when we 
are talking about an industry that has 
reached more than a trillion dollars in 
value, that has shed hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars in the past few months, 
it is time for caution. 
As I mentioned, cryptocurrencies— 
even 
the 
most 
well-known 
like 
Bitcoin—are poorly regulated, if they 
are regulated at all. And Bitcoin has 
seen wild swings. Bitcoin has lost 
roughly two-thirds of its value since

August 2, 2022 
last November. The cost of one Bitcoin 
fell from $68,000 to under $21,000. 
And these assets are not only vola-
tile, they are virtually untraceable. 
Compare that to an investment like a 
share of stock—and, yes, there is risk 
in the stock market—or an exchange- 
traded fund. If you are a retail investor 
and you buy a couple hundred dollars’ 
worth of shares in a company, you 
know you are assuming some risk. 
That is the nature of investment. 
But here is the difference. When you 
buy a stock, under the law, you can 
find out important information about 
the company: How many products are 
they selling? How much are they pay-
ing their executives? What risk does 
the company foresee? 
You have significantly more informa-
tion and transparency about where 
your investment is going. Many ETFs 
even disclose their holdings every day. 
After all, they have to. They are re-
quired by law. They are regulated by 
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion. 
With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, 
there is no such transparency. They 
are decentralized, illiquid, and highly 
speculative. Where are the disclosures? 
Where are the consumer protections? 
In many cases, there are none. Instead 
of encouraging working families to 
risk their hard-earned cash into re-
markably unstable investments, let’s 
pump the brakes on the rocket to the 
Moon. 
Last Tuesday, I sent a letter, along 
with my colleagues Senators Warren 
and Smith, to Fidelity Investments. 
They are one of the biggest 401(k) pro-
viders in the world. In April, they made 
a decision that surprised me and, 
frankly, concerned me. Fidelity says 
they will soon allow 401(k) plan spon-
sors to offer plan participants exposure 
to Bitcoin. 
Here is the issue. A 401(k) account is 
a nest egg. It is a vehicle that tens of 
millions of Americans rely on so that, 
many years from now, they can retire 
in dignity. And during this period of 
economic uncertainty, I can’t think of 
any reason to expose retirement savers 
to new risk. 
As we all saw on Super Bowl Sun-
day—whether 
it 
is 
Matt 
Damon, 
LeBron James, or Larry David—there 
is no shortage of options for people who 
want to invest in crypto. But retire-
ment accounts must be held to a higher 
standard, and my hope is that Fidelity 
will live up to its name and meet that 
standard by reversing this decision. 
It is also important to recognize 
that, even if you don’t invest in a sin-
gle cryptocurrency, we all have a stake 
in this industry. Why? Because the 
process for the so-called mining of 
these digital assets consumes jaw-drop-
ping amounts of energy. As of May, ac-
cording to the Public Broadcasting 
System: 
The world’s . . . Bitcoin mining operations 
had an annual energy budget nearly equal to 
the entire country of Argentina . . . or all 
the tea kettles in England boiling water for 
26 years. 
And seven of the largest Bitcoin min-
ing companies consume enough energy 
alone to power every single home in 
Houston. That is just Bitcoin. That 
calculation doesn’t even account for 
the fossil fuels being burned to produce 
other coins, like Dogecoin. 
When companies like Fidelity and ce-
lebrities like Larry David are hawking 
an 
asset 
class 
that 
is 
unstable, 
untraceable, and pumping untold tons 
of carbon into our atmosphere, we 
should all have the good sense to step 
back and wrap our heads around this 
trillion-dollar industry that is not even 
old enough today to drive a car. 
Madam President, I have been in sev-
eral meetings with my colleagues on 
this cryptocurrency. I am by no means 
an expert. I have tried to learn as much 
as I can, but it is an extremely com-
plicated operation. I will tell you this. 
I fear that we will do something but 
not enough. I fear that just a limited 
amount of regulation by the Federal 
Government may convince people that 
we really have a grip on what is hap-
pening in this industry. There is risk 
associated with it that is major. 
I have had some well-known and very 
successful individuals in my office, and 
I have asked them—they have made 
millions 
of 
dollars—What 
about 
crypto? Most of them have said: I 
wouldn’t touch it. 
Yet we have got to tell the American 
people, when it is advertised, when it is 
available, you have got to be careful— 
particularly when it comes to people 
with limited assets, people with an ad-
verse situation when it comes to risk, 
and people who are putting, literally, 
their savings and their retirement on 
the line on these investments. 
That is why I joined my colleagues in 
writing to Fidelity and asking them to 
rationalize how this can be part of any 
401(k) plan. We owe it to the American 
people to provide them the protection 
in this industry, as we have in so many 
other areas of investment. It is funda-
mental, it is fair, and it is the only way 
to guarantee them that they have some 
grip on making investments that could 
be in their best interest and might not 
be as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—S. 3373 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
have some good news. The minority 
leader and I have come to an agree-
ment to vote on the PACT Act this 
evening. There will be 3 amendment 
votes, a 60-vote margin on the Toomey 
amendment, on the Paul amendment, 
and on the Blackburn amendment, and 
then 60 votes for the bill. I am very op-
timistic that this bill will pass, so our 
veterans across America can breathe a 
sigh of relief. 
The treatments that they deserve 
and have needed but have been denied 
by the VA because of all kinds of legal 
barriers and presumptions will now be 
gone. Veterans who were exposed to 
the toxic fumes of burn pits will be 
treated by the VA like they should 
have been from the very beginning. 
So this is good news. It took us a 
while to get here, but I am grateful for 
the bipartisan cooperation and support 
that will allow us to move forward 
today. 
And a little bit more good news: The 
fact that we can finish PACT today 
gives us a real opportunity to do the 
treaties that will allow Finland and 
Sweden to join NATO. And that can 
happen tomorrow if we can come to a 
time agreement. I am very hopeful that 
that can happen as well. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that at 4 p.m. today the Senate 
proceed to legislative session and re-
sume consideration of the House mes-
sage to accompany S. 3373, with the 
time until 5 p.m. equally divided; fur-
ther, that it be in order to consider and 
vote in relation to a Paul motion to 
concur with amendment No. 5184, a 
Toomey motion to concur with amend-
ment No. 5186, and a Blackburn motion 
to concur with amendment No. 5185; 
that at 5 p.m., the Senate vote in rela-
tion to the motions in the order listed; 
that following disposition of the mo-
tions to concur with amendments num-
bered 5184, 5186, and 5185, the motion to 
refer and the amendments pending 
thereto and the motion to concur with 
amendment No. 5148 and the amend-
ment pending thereto be withdrawn 
and the Senate vote on the motion to 
concur in the House amendment to S. 
3373; that the Paul, Toomey, and 
Blackburn motions and the motion to 
concur be subject to a 60-vote affirma-
tive threshold, with 2 minutes for de-
bate, equally divided, prior to each 
vote; and that all votes after the first 
vote be 10-minute votes; all without in-
tervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. 
THUNE. 
Madam 
President, 
Democrats dropped the latest version 
of their tax-and-spending spree last 
week. And like every previous version, 
this bill is a bad deal for the American 
people. 
So where should I start? Well, maybe 
with the bill’s title. In true Orwellian 
style, Democrats are calling the bill 
the Inflation Reduction Act, even 
though the bill would do nothing to re-
duce inflation. And you don’t have to 
take my word for it. 
The 
nonpartisan 
Penn 
Wharton 
Budget Model analyzed the bill and 
found that the bill would not reduce in-
flation. In fact, the analysis found that

S3843 
August 2, 2022 
the Democrats’ bill would contribute 
to inflation through 2024 and have no 
material impact on inflation in the 
long term. 
Inflation has hit working Americans 
hard. 
Their 
grocery 
bills 
have 
ballooned. Rents have skyrocketed. 
Filling up their cars costs 75 percent 
more per gallon than it did when the 
President took office. Their utility 
bills have increased. And the list goes 
on. 
Families are having to cut back on 
purchases and dig into their savings or 
pull out their credit cards—or in some 
cases, visit a food bank—to make ends 
meet. 
And what does Democrats’ tax-and- 
spending spree do to help? Nothing. 
Americans are dealing with the worst 
inflation in more than 40 years, and 
Democrats’ bill does nothing to help 
end our current crisis. 
So what does the bill do? Well, for 
one thing, it raises taxes. That is right. 
Our economy has shrunk for each of 
the past two quarters—in fact, by any 
common definition we are now in a re-
cession—and the Democrats’ bill raises 
taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars. 
Here is what the Democratic leader 
previously had to say about raising 
taxes in a recession. 
If we’re in a recession and we’re in a dif-
ficult economic time, I don’t think Sen. 
Obama or anyone else is going to raise any 
taxes. You don’t want to take money out of 
the economy when the economy is shrinking. 
That is something the Democratic 
leader has previously said. 
President Obama himself expressed a 
similar sentiment when he said: 
[T]he last thing you want to do is to raise 
taxes in the middle of a recession. 
‘‘The last thing.’’ Apparently, that 
doesn’t apply when Democrats have 
Green New Deal projects they want to 
pay for. 
The Democrats’ bill attempts to off-
set the cost of the Green New Deal 
spending spree by raising taxes on 
American 
businesses, 
particularly— 
particularly—manufacturers. The pro-
posed book minimum tax would be a 
$313 billion tax hike, with roughly half 
of that increase falling on American 
manufacturers. 
I don’t think I need to tell anyone 
the likely outcome of raising taxes on 
businesses, particularly when the econ-
omy is contracting. The likely out-
come is less growth, lower wages, and 
fewer jobs. 
According to an analysis from the 
National Association of Manufacturers, 
in 2023 alone, the bill would reduce real 
gross domestic product by more than 
$68 billion and result in 218,108 fewer 
workers 
in 
the 
overall 
economy— 
218,000 fewer workers in 2023 alone. 
That is according to the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers if the Demo-
crats’ bill passes. 
The Democrats’ bill also raises taxes 
on the energy sector—specifically, on 
domestic oil and gas production. It is 
another face-palm move from Demo-
crats. 
Currently, gas prices are 75 percent 
higher than they were when President 
Biden took office. Electricity prices 
are up. The cost of utility gas service is 
way up. And yet Democrats think it is 
a good idea to raise taxes on domestic 
oil and gas production. Apparently, 
Democrats want our current high en-
ergy prices to stick around for the long 
term. 
So what are Democrats going to use 
all that tax-hike money for? Well, for 
one thing, they are going to use it to 
fund Green New Deal projects; critical 
priorities like monitoring gaps in tree 
canopy coverage and road equity and 
funding—funding—for the post office’s 
purchase of electric delivery vehicles. 
And then there are the multiple slush 
funds for Green New Deal projects and 
the tax credit for the purchase of a new 
electric car or truck. Of course, you 
will only be able to use the credit if 
you can afford to spend somewhere in 
the neighborhood of $60,000, which is 
the average price for a new electric ve-
hicle, while we are in the middle of a 
recession. 
So it would almost undoubtedly be 
mostly Americans with higher sala-
ries—and according to the bill, up to 
$300,000 per household—who would be 
able to make use of this credit. So it is 
a tax credit to buy electric vehicles for 
rich people. 
But I guess Democrats think electric 
vehicle tax credits for wealthier Amer-
icans are a good use of taxpayer dol-
lars. 
What else is in here? I mentioned the 
bill’s tax hikes, but the Democrats’ bill 
also attempts to raise revenue by in-
creasing IRS audits and enforcement. 
That is right. The Democrats’ bill 
would more than double the current 
number of IRS employees, making the 
Agency nearly three times larger than 
the U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion—the Agency, I might add, that is 
charged with security at all of our Na-
tion’s borders—and more than 50 per-
cent larger—this is the IRS on the 
Democrats’ plan—more than 50 percent 
larger than the entire U.S. Department 
of Agriculture. 
Democrats give the IRS a whopping 
$80 billion in additional funding over 
the next 10 years. Of that $80 billion, 57 
percent goes to enforcement; 4 percent 
goes to taxpayer services. That is 
right: 4 percent. This is an Agency that 
only succeeded in answering about 1 
out of every 50 phone calls during the 
2021 tax season, and yet 4 percent of the 
$80 billion is going to taxpayer serv-
ices. Fifty-seven percent goes to en-
forcement so that the IRS can spend 
more time harassing taxpayers around 
this country. Democrats are focused 
not on improving the IRS’s responsive-
ness to taxpayers, but on boosting the 
number of IRS audits. 
I still haven’t mentioned the bill’s 
socialist-style price controls for pre-
scription drugs—price controls that 
would result in fewer new drugs and 
treatments. A study from last Novem-
ber found that Democrats’ price con-
trol plans would result in 135 fewer new 
drugs through 2039. That is a lot of po-
tentially life-changing and lifesaving 
treatments to lose. 
Then, of course, there is Democrats’ 
plan to expand Obamacare subsidies to 
higher earning Americans, a move 
which would drive up the cost of health 
insurance. 
I could go on. 
Most Americans remember the lead- 
up to Democrats’ American Rescue 
Plan spending spree last March. We 
were promised—they were promised— 
at the time that passing that bill 
would have big benefits for our econ-
omy and for American families. Well, 
we know what actually happened. 
Democrats’ reckless spending spree 
helped trigger the worst inflation for 
decades, and American families have 
suffered as a result. 
Now we are being asked to swallow a 
similar story about the Democrats’ lat-
est spending legislation. This bill will 
help our economy, we are told, even 
though we know it would make life 
harder for American businesses and 
workers at a time when the economy is 
already contracting. Make no mistake 
about that. This is the second consecu-
tive quarter where we have had nega-
tive economic growth, negative GDP 
growth, in our economy. 
It will help inflation, Democrats 
claim, even though a nonpartisan anal-
ysis said it would do nothing—nothing 
to help alleviate our current crisis. 
It will reduce our deficit, Democrats 
say, relying on some very shady ac-
counting measures to reach their sup-
posed deficit reduction number. 
It will help lower energy prices, the 
President claims, even though new en-
ergy taxes would further inflate near- 
term energy bills during a season of al-
ready historic prices. 
You would think Democrats might 
have been chastened by their disas-
trous American Rescue Plan spending 
spree, but you would be wrong. Appar-
ently, Democrats are determined to get 
in another disastrous spending bill. 
And, once again, it will be the Amer-
ican people that will be left to suffer 
the consequences. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Delaware. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, the 
Republican leader knows I am a huge 
fan of his. Every Thursday, we gather, 
along with Senator GILLIBRAND, we 
gather in a Bible study, bipartisan 
Bible study. Most people think we 
would never pray together, read the 
scripture together, much less agree on 
anything, but we do that every week. 
We agree on a lot of things. In this one 
area, I am afraid we don’t see eye to 
eye, as he knows. 
As a leader prepared to lead the floor, 
I just want to remind us all of this: 
Two weeks ago, the United Kingdom 
broke its record for the highest re-
corded temperature multiple times, 
reaching a high of 105 degrees Fahr-
enheit. How high is that? They don’t

have air conditioning in most places of 
England. They don’t have air condi-
tioning—105 degrees. Airport runways 
that week were melting in the United 
Kingdom. Railways in the United King-
dom were buckling from the heat, with 
riders warned to stay home. 
Over 1,100 people that week died in 
Spain and Portugal from heat-related 
causes. Wildfires in France forced 
about 30,000 people to evacuate. Orga-
nizers planned to pour—listen to this— 
tens of thousands of gallons of water 
on the course of the Tour De France 
big bicycle race in order to keep the 
road from melting. And more than 40 
million people in the United States are 
under extreme heat warnings across, in 
our country, the Great Plains and Cali-
fornia. 
Something like 60 million Americans 
will likely see temperatures at or 
above 100 degrees. Last week, they ac-
tually did, as I understand it. Nearly 60 
percent of California has been dealing 
with excessive drought while 20 per-
cent—20 percent—of Texas experiences 
exceptional drought, the most extreme 
level on the drought scale. Firefighters 
continue to battle huge wildfires across 
the United States—12 States, no less— 
wildfires as big as my State of Dela-
ware. 
The reason why we have put together 
legislation 
that 
actually 
addresses 
these tale of horribles is because it is 
getting worse. The scientists and peo-
ple who we look to for advice on stuff 
like this say it is not going to get bet-
ter any time soon; it is going to get 
worse. 
In Louisiana, you know what they 
lose from sea level rise every 100 min-
utes? They lose a piece of land the size 
of a football field. I will say that again. 
In Louisiana, they lose a piece of land 
to the sea the size of a football field— 
not every 100 days, not every 100 
weeks—every 100 minutes. 
Something is happening here, and I 
think what it is, is exactly clear. There 
is way too much carbon in the air. The 
question is, What are we going to do 
about it? And there is something that 
we can do about it that not only ad-
dresses the climate crisis so these 
young pages sitting down here will not 
only have a planet to live on, but some 
day, they will have kids and grand-
children, and there will be a planet for 
them as well. That is why we have to 
do something. 
Here is the good thing about the 
PACT Act that we will be voting on 
later this week. It is paid for. Larry 
Summers—the 
former 
Secretary 
of 
Treasury, former president of Harvard, 
renowned 
economist—basically 
says 
this package is not only balanced in 
terms of its budgetary effect, but in 
terms of its effect on inflation, it is ac-
tually counterinflationary. 
The idea that somehow the IRS 
would get more money to do their job, 
let me say this: I have been on the Fi-
nance Committee for a number of years 
here in the Senate. Every couple of 
years, we have the Commissioner of the 
IRS come before us. I don’t care if it is 
a Democrat or Republican administra-
tion. They beg us to provide resources 
for the IRS so they can do their jobs. 
The people that actually get audited 
the most are actually poor people. 
Folks that get audited the least are 
wealthy people, maybe the big corpora-
tions. The IRS needs resources. They 
need human beings; they need folks 
with the right skills; they need the 
kind of technology—they want to do 
their jobs. If they do that, they can 
collect hundreds of billions of dollars, 
not by raising taxes but by making 
sure people are paying their fair share 
of taxes. That is what we are really 
trying to do with this legislation. It is 
paid for. It actually works against in-
flation. 
It helps people, particularly people 
who happen to be older and actually 
need access to pharmaceuticals. The 
legislation we have actually says if you 
happen to be a senior citizen and you 
are on Medicare Part D for the drug 
program, there is no way you are going 
to pay over $2,000 in a year—no way. 
Today, you pay a lot more than that. 
We put a cap on that. 
But by the same token, as a Senator 
from a State where we actually have a 
big interest in biopharmaceuticals— 
our whole area, including Philadelphia, 
New Jersey, and so forth—we don’t 
want to kill the goose that lays the 
golden egg. We want to make sure they 
are still successful. We don’t want to 
stifle innovation in the biopharma-
ceutical world. This legislation does 
not do that. It does not do that. 
It does say with the jobs for which 
there is no competition, there has to be 
some cap on the ability to raise the 
price of those drugs. I think it is com-
mon sense. I think it is common sense. 
Some of us have heard the term 
‘‘unforced error.’’ My detractors have 
sometimes said: I am guilty of making 
an unforced error. If truth were known, 
we all make unforced errors. Our Re-
publican friends made an unforced 
error here. What they have done is 
they chose—because of their anger or 
unhappiness with the agreement with 
Senator MANCHIN and Senator SCHUMER 
to move forward and address climate 
change in a way that is paid for and ac-
tually adds to economic job creation— 
they were unhappy and, unfortunately, 
they, apparently, took their anger out 
on the ability for us to move to legisla-
tion that actually helps the veterans 
deal with injuries they suffered in their 
lives from being exposed to toxic sub-
stances from these burn pits around 
the world. 
I know a little bit about the mili-
tary. I am the last Vietnam veteran 
serving in the U.S. Senate. We had a 
bite out of this apple in Southeast Asia 
in the Vietnam war. It was called 
Agent Orange. It was called Agent Or-
ange, and hundreds of thousands of Vi-
etnamese were exposed to Agent Or-
ange. But a lot of folks in American 
service, men and some women, as well, 
were exposed. They had all kinds of 
maladies. And later on, they had ques-
tions that we are thinking about: Are 
we going to make sure you are eligible 
for care from the VA and don’t have to 
pay for all of it out of their pocket? We 
have done that and, I think, in a very 
appropriate way. We did it decades ago. 
I am privileged to be a supporter of 
that, as were many of our colleagues, 
Democratic and Republican. 
We have a different kind of situation, 
but it is a similar situation in that we 
have a bunch of veterans who served in 
places like Afghanistan and other 
places where they breathed air that 
was toxic. It is not their fault. And 
later on, they became sick. The ques-
tion is, What do we do about it? 
The veteran service organizations 
have been very angry at our Repub-
lican colleagues. I am glad our Repub-
lican friends have come back and said: 
We realize we voted to derail the PACT 
Act to help veterans from these burn 
pit injuries. We realize we maybe 
shouldn’t have done that. We all make 
mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes. 
I am the only Democrat I know in 
this body who ever quotes Richard 
Nixon. Richard Nixon used to say that 
the only people who don’t make mis-
takes are people who don’t do any-
thing. Think about that. That is pretty 
good, huh? The only people who don’t 
make mistakes are people who don’t do 
anything. 
They made an unforced error. They 
voted in a way that was not consistent 
with their interests and not consistent 
with the interests of veterans, of which 
I am one. 
They have an opportunity here—I 
will say this in a spiritual tone here— 
they have an opportunity to atone for 
their sins, and my hope is they are 
going to do that. 
I hope at the same time as we do 
that, we will keep in mind this list of 
horribles that just went down—going 
on in the face of the Earth just a week 
or 2 ago. We have to do something 
about it. It is real. We have to do some-
thing about it. Time is not on our side. 
Time is not on the side of these young 
people here who are like 16, 17 years 
old. 
I have one last point here. I am going 
to go back to what some people say—I 
am privileged to chair the Committee 
on Environment and Public Works. We 
have jurisdiction over clean air, clean 
water, climate change, roads, high-
ways, 
bridges, 
water, 
sanitation—a 
bunch of stuff, good stuff. As a result of 
that, we have the opportunity to write 
legislation that hopefully addresses a 
real cause, a real problem. 
One of the problems we found in cli-
mate change is the biggest source of 
carbon dioxide, the biggest source of 
greenhouse gas emissions comes from 
the cars, trucks, and vans that we 
drive, the vehicles that we drive. That 
is the biggest source. There used to 
be—as Senator GILLIBRAND
knows—a 
bank robber, Willie Sutton. He used to 
rob a lot of banks. He finally got 
caught. He was dragged into court, and

at trial, the judge said: Mr. Sutton, 
why do you rob banks? 
Your Honor, I rob banks because that 
is where the money is. 
One of the reasons why we want to 
encourage people in this country to 
buy vehicles that don’t spew out a lot 
of greenhouse gases is because that is 
the biggest part of where our emissions 
are. Thirty percent of greenhouse gases 
in this country come from cars, trucks, 
and vans. We want to encourage people, 
as they are ready to buy a new vehicle, 
to consider an electric vehicle. 
One of the things that I really like 
about the bill that we are going to be 
debating later this week is, we actually 
encourage people to buy not just the 
new, expensive vehicles, but to buy 
used electric vehicles. So the middle- 
and lower-income people who may not 
be able to afford a new electric vehicle, 
they can buy one. If they want to be 
good to the planet, kind to the planet, 
they can buy a used one. We provide a 
modest tax cut for them. 
The tax cuts, I might add, in the bill 
that we will take up later this week 
are a lot more modest than they were 
originally. I think that is a good thing. 
Again, we all make unforced errors. I 
know I have, and I believe—I say this 
lovingly—our 
Republican 
colleagues 
made a big one, and I think they regret 
it. They have the opportunity to do 
something about it and to do the right 
thing. 
Let’s do that. Let’s do the right thing 
by veterans, and let’s move on. And 
then later this week, we will take up 
another challenge, and that is, how do 
we save this planet and make sure that 
my kids, my grandchildren, our grand-
children, have the opportunity to have 
a planet that is worth growing up on? 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

ment No. 5151), to modify the effective date. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the time until 5 
p.m. is equally divided. 
The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to discuss helping our serv-
icemembers exposed to toxic burn pits. 
For days now, servicemembers and 
their families have been camping out-
side this very building in desperation. 
They are pleading with us, they are 
begging us to pass this bill. They have 
been out there all weekend in 90-degree 
heat, sheltering themselves from thun-
derstorms, as well as oppressive humid-
ity. I have been down there to visit 
them three times now, and I can tell 
you, they are exhausted. They miss 
their families. They want to go home, 
but they will not. They will not go 
home until the job is done because the 
suffering they are enduring now pales 
in comparison to the suffering they, 
their fellow veterans, or their fellow 
family members experience every day 
because of the injuries sustained be-
cause of the exposure to the toxins re-
leased at these burn pits. 
Last week, before it became clear 
that the PACT Act would fail, these 
families came to DC ready to celebrate. 
The mother-in-law of SFC Heath Rob-
inson, who died because of burn pits, 
came with Heath’s daughter Brielle, 
who was excited to finally celebrate 
her father’s legacy finally coming to 
fruition. Instead, we had to explain to 
a crying 9-year-old girl why this would 
not be happening, why the Senate had 
failed them. 
So I don’t want anyone to just listen 
to me rattle off a bunch of statistics or 
facts about burn pits; I want you to lis-
ten to these people, the families, peo-
ple who are literally giving every 
ounce of their being in service to this 
country, people with families, people 
with kids, people who are willing to 
upend their lives at the very moment’s 
notice to fight for the values that 
make us who we are. Instead, when 
their lungs were filled with toxins, the 
government turned its back on them 
when they needed us the most. We 
made a promise to them to care for 
them when they came home, and that 
promise has been broken. 
Failure to pass this bill again is not 
just some small disappointment, some-
thing that can be easily brushed off or 
disregarded; failure to pass this bill 
quite literally for many is a death sen-
tence because every single day, every 
hour, every minute they don’t get the 
healthcare they need to save their lives 
is just another minute lost to the dis-
eases that are devouring them. It is an-
other minute they won’t have to be 
with their loved ones, to hug their chil-
dren; another minute they don’t get to 
be with their loved ones to kiss them 
goodbye; another minute they cannot 
do the things they love to do. So we 
don’t have time to wait another week, 
another month; we have to do this now. 
This is what is at stake with this bill. 
It is the lives of the men and women 
who went to combat for this country 
over the last many decades and unfor-
tunately have been so riddled with dis-
ease because of that exposure that they 
need our help. They need the VA to 
cover their healthcare. That is what 
this bill does. This is what they de-
serve. 
I hope that this Chamber can come 
back together again where it was be-
fore last week to do the right thing, to 
stand by those who stood by us, to 
stand by those who went into the 
breach, to stand by those who are now 
suffering and dying because it is a debt 
that we owe them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
late tonight, the Senate will vote on 
my amendment No. 5185 to the PACT 
Act, and as my colleague from New 
York was just saying, it is time that 
we deal with the issues of toxic expo-
sure. As a member of the VA Com-
mittee, 
this 
is 
something 
I 
have 
worked on for the last few years. 
Tennessee has a large population of 
veterans, and we have talked a good bit 
about this issue and how they receive 
their care. 
One of the concerns that we had dis-
cussed in committee, in our hearings— 
we have discussed it with our VSOs, 
and we have discussed this issue as we 
have talked with veterans who have 
come to us and to our meetings—is 
their frustration with having access to 
the queue but not getting access to the 
care. I think we have to look at this 
and say: Those are very different. 
Now, I join our veterans in being 
frustrated with the fact that there is 
access to the queue to get on that wait 
list but not getting that care. So the 
amendment I am offering is not polit-
ical. It is not controversial. It is a sim-
ple but much needed improvement to 
the PACT Act that will allow toxic-ex-
posed veterans to gain access to com-
munity care to ensure they have a 
speedy process to care. 
The amendment is critical to the suc-
cess of this program, and we all want 
the program to be successful, but what 
we know is that the VA is not capable 
of implementing the PACT Act as it is 
written. They have neither the infra-
structure nor the personnel to do that. 
What we have learned is that the VA 
cannot deliver what is promised be-
cause it does not have the capacity to 
handle the increased cases. Secretary 
McDonough said as much in testimony 
submitted to the VA Committee in 
March of this year. 
Right now, the claims backlog at the 
VA sits at 168,000 cases. The PACT Act 
as written will increase that backlog 
by more than 1 million cases. 
Right now in Tennessee, this is the 
practical effect of this in Tennessee:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3846 
August 2, 2022 
Veterans who come to me are telling 
me they are waiting about 100 days for 
a primary care appointment at the VA. 
For many of our veterans, that is just 
step 1—getting that primary care ap-
pointment so they get on the list. So 
after they call, they are waiting 100 
days to get that first appointment, and 
then they get a referral to someone 
else, a specialist. 
Now, for our veterans in Tennessee, 
once they get that referral, it is 39 days 
to get to mental health care, 44 days to 
get to a dental appointment, 33 days if 
they are trying to see a cardiologist, 28 
days to see a gynecologist, and 30 days 
to get to someone who can help them 
with pain. That is the amount of wait. 
To me, that is unacceptable, com-
pletely unacceptable. 
My colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle know that many, if not most, of 
these veterans who have toxic exposure 
are deteriorating rapidly. They do not 
have time to wait while the VA decides 
how they are going to implement this. 
They deserve access to care as quickly 
as they can possibly get it. 
We are so close to getting these vet-
erans the care they deserve, but if the 
PACT Act is going to work for vet-
erans, we need to step up and give 
them access to community care. My 
amendment will open up that access. It 
will make that an option so they don’t 
have to struggle through waiting in the 
queue. They can go to a physician in 
their community for that primary care 
appointment so that they can get this 
process started. This will help them to 
avoid the long wait times and the arbi-
trary hurdles, and it will let them seek 
that care in the community if they can 
get it faster than making that trip to 
the VA. 
As I said, this is not controversial. 
There is no political scandal on it. It is 
a simple fix that will ensure that this 
promise that we are going to make in 
the PACT Act will be made to every 
single veteran who has experienced 
toxic exposure so that we are certain 
that the PACT Act does not end up as 
a false promise or a false hope. 
These veterans have given so much. 
They have served honorably. It is im-
perative that we provide them not ac-
cess to the queue but access to the care 
they have earned. 
Thank you. I urge my colleagues to 
vote yes on the amendment when it 
comes up for a vote later this evening. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we abso-
lutely must take care of those who 
were harmed in service to our country. 
I have supported several bills to take 
care of our veterans. In February of 
this year, I supported a bill that passed 
the Senate called the Health Care for 
Burn Pit Veterans Act, which extends 
the eligibility period for combat vet-
erans who served after 9/11 and were ex-
posed to toxic substances so they are 
able to receive care at the VA. I have 
also supported the VA MISSION Act, 
the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas SERV-
ICE Act, the TEAM Caregivers Act, 
and the Veterans Appeals Improvement 
and Modernization Act, all of which ex-
pand care for veterans. When the war 
in Afghanistan came to a close, I pro-
posed using those funds saved by end-
ing the war to give a $2,500 bonus to all 
members of the military who served in 
the Global War on Terrorism. 
We must take care of our veterans 
and keep our country strong. This bill 
puts our economy, though, at risk by 
creating presumptions of service con-
nection for the most common of ail-
ments. For example, this legislation 
creates a presumption of service con-
nection for Vietnam veterans for hy-
pertension, but according to the CDC, 
50 percent of men and 44 percent of 
women in the United States have hy-
pertension. More than 60 percent of 
people over the age of 60 have hyper-
tension. In total, the CDC estimates 
that 116 million Americans have hyper-
tension. The legislation also creates a 
presumption of service connection for 
Global War on Terror veterans for 
asthma. The CDC estimates that 1 in 12 
people has asthma, which is approxi-
mately 25 million Americans. 
This bill would cost hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars at a time when the na-
tional debt is climbing over $30 trillion 
and inflation is at a 40-year high. But 
the Federal debt was created by Con-
gress and not our vets, and those who 
serve in the armed services should not 
be the ones to pay the cost for govern-
ment mismanagement. That is why I 
propose that we pay for this bill by es-
tablishing a 10-year moratorium on for-
eign aid disbursed by USAID, except 
for Israel. USAID is riddled with waste, 
and those dollars could be better put to 
use to help to take care of our vet-
erans’ healthcare. 
Just this year, USAID unveiled a $50 
million Visit Tunisia program to en-
courage more tourism in Tunisia al-
though Tunisia is already one of the 
most visited countries in Africa. 
In 2016, USAID started a program to 
help the Afghan Government help 
farmers as it cut checks to NGOs to 
fund Afghan farmers. 
The program paid for 72 farmers to 
receive drip irrigation, pipes, wheel-
barrow, 2,000-liter water tank, and a 5- 
kilowatt generator for a cost of $87.9 
million. Whether the systems are still 
in function or were actually built is an-
other question. 
USAID spent over $37 million to as-
sist the Filipino Government to get 
roughly 3 million Filipinos back to 
school. Maybe we ought to do the same 
in America. 
USAID devoted 20 million to teach 
the Laotians the Laotian language. 
In another instance, USAID allocated 
up to $150,000 to send 10 Koreans to 
Washington, DC, for 2 weeks to learn 
about climate change activism. That is 
a great use of our money. 
Wouldn’t Congress rather spend the 
money on our veterans? Wouldn’t it 
make more sense to spend taxpayer 
dollars on veterans who have risked it 
all for their country than on encour-
aging travel to Tunisia? 
That is why I seek my colleagues’ 
support for my amendment that would 
help pay for the hundreds of billions of 
dollars in this bill. Our veterans should 
come first. 
I ask your support for my amend-
ment on this pay-for amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
MOTION TO CONCUR WITH AMENDMENT NO. 5184 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I move to 
concur in the House message to accom-
pany S. 3373 with amendment No. 5184. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. PAUL] 
moves to concur in the House amendment to 
S. 3373 with an amendment numbered 5184. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask that 
the reading be dispensed with. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To offset the increased spending 
authorized by this Act by temporarily pro-
hibiting the expenditure of any Federal 
funds by the United States Agency for 
International 
Development 
other 
than 
spending for Israel.) 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. OFFSET THROUGH TEMPORARY RE-
DUCTION IN FOREIGN ASSISTANCE 
PROGRAMS. 
During the 10-year period beginning on Oc-
tober 1, 2022, no Federal funds may be ex-
pended by the United States Agency for 
International Development other than funds 
that have been appropriated for Israel. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
S. 3373 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to 
discuss the PACT Act, on which we will 
be voting for several amendments and 
then we will have a final passage vote 
later this evening. 
This 
could 
have 
been 
resolved 
months ago, as I suggested it would be, 
but finally we have gotten to the point 
where we can resolve this. 
And I have to say we are witnessing 
a very old Washington trick playing 
out on what might be an unprecedented 
scale. 
And what is that trick? 
That trick is you take a very sympa-
thetic group of Americans—it could be 
children with rare diseases; it could be 
victims of crime; it could be veterans 
who are suffering an illness after hav-
ing been exposed to toxic chemicals 
while serving our country—you take 
this sympathetic group, craft legisla-
tion to address their problems, and 
then sneak in something that is com-
pletely unrelated that could never pass 
on its own and dare anyone to stand up 
and say a word about that because we 
all know, if you raise a concern about 
the unrelated provision, people in this 
Chamber and outside will stand up and 
make up all kinds of fabrications and 
falsehoods. 
They will enlist some pseudo celeb-
rities, they will get their accomplices

August 2, 2022 
in the media to propagate the dis-
honest charge that: Oh, those mean Re-
publicans don’t care about those sym-
pathetic figures. That is what has been 
going on here for some time now. 
It is in the PACT Act. We have an ex-
ceptionally sympathetic, overwhelm-
ingly popular group of Americans—and 
rightly so. They are veterans who put 
on the uniform, served overseas, took 
huge risks, and along the way were ex-
posed to toxic chemicals that have re-
sulted or could have resulted in their 
illness. 
There is overwhelming consensus to 
provide the resources to at least cover 
their healthcare costs and provide 
them with disability benefits because 
of their service to our country. 
In fact, the cause is so popular that 
the $280 billion of new spending con-
templated by this bill is completely 
unoffset. It is mandatory spending. It 
is like OCO, and there is nobody I know 
of—certainly not myself—who is ask-
ing that it be offset. It is like, this is 
what we need to do and people ac-
knowledge this and we agree on it. 
But that is not where the PACT Act 
ends. That is not all there is to the 
PACT Act. It also includes the old 
Washington trick. And the form the 
trick takes in this bill is a complicated 
change to budget rules that allows cur-
rent spending—by which I mean spend-
ing that is going to happen under exist-
ing law unrelated to the PACT Act, 
that spending that is routine already— 
to be basically shifted off the books, so 
to speak, in such a way that is de-
signed to make it easier for future Con-
gresses to spend a whole lot more 
money on completely unrelated pro-
grams. 
The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that this clever little device will 
result—could result in up to maybe 
even a little more than $400 billion of 
additional spending over the next 10 
years; again, totally outside of the vet-
eran space, totally outside. 
Now, the chairman of the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs is my friend JON 
TESTER, a guy I know and like. He 
pretty much essentially acknowledged 
that yes, the legislation could be ex-
ploited this way. But he said: But you 
should have faith. You should have 
confidence and trust in your col-
leagues, future Congresses, that we 
wouldn’t do a thing like that. 
Seriously? I am supposed to trust 
this and future Congresses not to go on 
a spending spree—seriously? That is 
unbelievable. And, by the way, if I 
should have that trust, then why did 
they design this feature precisely so 
they could go on a spending spree? 
This isn’t the first time this has hap-
pened. A good example is the CHIPS 
program. That is an acronym for the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program. 
It was created in 1997. It is a very pop-
ular program. It is mandatory spend-
ing, completely unoffset. It is a very 
good cause. That is why. 
In 2009, Congress started providing 
more funding than was necessary to 
fund the program—much more than 
would actually be spent on the kids 
that qualified for it. Congress did this 
very knowingly and started doing it 
annually. Why, you might ask, would 
Congress provide more funding than 
the program requires? Because the 
amount by which this funding exceeds 
what gets spent can be spent on other 
programs. 
It is a trick. It is a budget trick that 
allows for more spending in unrelated 
areas. 
The Crime Victims Fund has a very 
similar dynamic. Criminal penalties go 
into a fund that is supposed to go to 
victims of crime, but they set up the 
rules so that, in any given year, if we 
spend less than the amount of money 
that went into this fund, they can pre-
tend those are budget savings and then 
spend the money somewhere else. 
So my point is that we have seen this 
before. It is being played out again, but 
I don’t think we have ever seen it on 
this scale—$400 billion over the next 10 
years. 
We have budgets and we have budget 
rules for reasons. They are meant to 
try to provide some guardrails on 
spending. Now, Congress can always 
disregard them. Any Congress can al-
ways disregard budget rules for a good 
reason or a bad reason. If there are 60 
votes, the budget rules can be waived. 
By the way, there are five budget 
points of order against this bill. I am 
not aware that anyone has raised a sin-
gle one. We are not going to have a 
vote on any one, and that is because 
people say the new spending for these 
veterans is so important that we are 
going to waive the budget rules that 
this bill breaks, and I think that is the 
right thing to do. But to think that the 
appropriations process is going to be a 
sufficient check on the abuse of this 
gimmick that is in this bill is very un-
realistic. 
You know, the Senate can always 
vote against a future spending bill that 
would take advantage of this. All right, 
so this is one of the arguments we have 
heard: Well, yes, you can always vote 
against this if Congress were to exploit 
this gimmick and start spending these 
$400 billion. 
But here is the problem. In a given 
year, that would be about $40 billion, 
right? Four hundred over 10 years 
means $400 billion of this extraneous 
spending annually. Except, as the Pre-
siding Officer knows very well, we typi-
cally fund the government with one 
giant bill—an omnibus spending bill 
that is over 1,000 pages long, usually. 
Nowadays, it is about $1.7 trillion. And 
$40 billion is a lot of money, but it is 3 
percent of $1.7 trillion. 
So if you object to exploiting this 
budget gimmick and exploiting this 
loophole and spending $40 billion that 
shouldn’t be spent on who knows what, 
you can vote against the whole bill and 
that is your only option—vote to shut 
down the government and not spend 
any money at all. That is no discipli-
nary mechanism. That is no mecha-
nism for proper oversight. 
Now, you may hear that my amend-
ment caps spending for veterans, and I 
want to be very clear about this. The 
chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee said my amendment would 
place a limit on the amount of funding 
Congress could provide to cover care 
and benefits to veterans made avail-
able by this legislation and could cre-
ate a scenario where the VA runs out of 
funding. 
That is completely, 100-percent factu-
ally false. It is very hard to believe 
that the chairman of the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee is not aware of that. 
But here is the truth. The fund that 
is created in the PACT Act—the fund 
that the chairman of the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee is referring to, the 
fund where we cap the money that goes 
into this fund—that fund does not have 
the meaning that any normal person 
thinks a fund has. This is not a pool of 
money. This is not an account at a 
bank from which doctors are paid. This 
is nothing more than an accounting de-
vice. This is just a mechanism that the 
Federal Government uses to classify 
spending as mandatory instead of dis-
cretionary. That is all it is. 
And there are no limits whatsoever. 
This is an important point. My amend-
ment has no limits whatsoever on the 
amount that Congress can appropriate 
in any given year or in the cumulative 
total of years for veterans’ healthcare 
or 
other 
benefits. 
My 
amendment 
doesn’t affect that in any way whatso-
ever. Congress can appropriate a tril-
lion dollars in a given year. 
What my amendment would do is it 
would limit the amount of that appro-
priation that could be considered man-
datory spending as opposed to discre-
tionary 
spending. 
That 
is 
it. 
My 
amendment is 100 percent about how 
the government designates the spend-
ing. It has nothing to do with how 
much is actually spent. 
Now, what matters to a veteran who 
is ill because of a toxic exposure? I 
think what matters to him is that the 
money is there to cover what he needs. 
That is what he should be concerned 
about, and that will be there. 
What I am trying to limit is the ex-
tent to which they can use a budgetary 
gimmick to reclassify spending so that 
they can go on an unrelated spending 
binge. 
So what would happen if the cost for 
actually caring for veterans in a given 
year is bigger than the cap we set? Ap-
propriators 
simply 
appropriate 
the 
amount that is needed. My cap has no 
bearing on how much appropriators can 
spend. It only limits how much gets 
treated as mandatory spending. 
If my amendment is adopted, spend-
ing on veterans’ benefits would not be 
reduced by one penny. Spending on vet-
erans’ families would not be reduced by 
one penny. The $280 billion in new 
spending as a result of the PACT Act 
would not be reduced by a penny. It 
would not be offset. 
We have no attempt to make any 
change to any of that. If anyone is sug-
gesting that my amendment would, in

any way, reduce care for veterans or 
require rationing of care, they are ei-
ther completely misinformed or they 
are being dishonest. 
So why does this matter? Why did 
the authors of the bill want to create 
this device that shifts this spending 
that is going to happen anyway from 
discretionary spending to mandatory 
spending? Because we have a cap on 
total discretionary spending, and for 
any spending that gets pulled out of 
the discretionary spending category 
and goes to a different category, that 
creates a hole under the cap. Congress 
will fill that hole with spending on who 
knows what. That is the way this is 
going to play out. That is what is going 
to happen. 
Now, some people have suggested 
that my amendment, if adopted, would 
kill the bill. Now, think about that. An 
amendment that does not cut spending 
on veterans’ care or veterans’ benefits 
by one dime but does make it harder 
for Congress to go on an unrelated $400 
billion spending spree—that is going to 
kill the bill? Really? 
Well, if that would kill the bill, then 
it speaks volumes about what is really 
important to the people who would 
vote no as a result of making it clear 
that unrelated spending is more impor-
tant than the spending on the vet-
erans—if my amendment would kill the 
bill. 
So I don’t think passage of my 
amendment would kill the bill. It 
would frustrate the efforts of those 
who want to have the skids greased for 
a massive spending binge. It would 
definitely do that. But it wouldn’t cut 
one dime of spending for veterans’ care, 
and I think in the end the bill would 
pass. 
I have this very simple solution. It 
allows us to fully fund our vets. It 
eliminates this budgetary gimmick 
that greases the skids for unrelated 
spending. And I would just urge my 
colleagues that hiding unrelated spend-
ing behind the sacrifice our veterans 
have made is no way to go. I would 
urge support for my amendment.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in just a 
few minutes—in fact, maybe I should 
say finally in just a few minutes—the 
Senate will vote once again on the Ser-
geant First Class Heath Robinson Hon-
oring Our Promise to Address Com-
prehensive Toxics Act of 2022, known as 
the PACT Act. 
Thousands of veterans who answered 
their call to serve after the terrorist 
attacks 
of 
9/11 
suffered 
the 
con-
sequences to their health with expo-
sure to open burn pits. Many of these 
veterans are simultaneously experi-
encing a battle with the VA—a battle 
with their health conditions and now a 
battle with the Department of Vet-
erans 
Affairs—to 
gain 
access 
to 
healthcare and the benefits that they 
desperately need and, in reality, earned 
and deserve. 
For more than 2 years, I worked with 
my colleagues on the Senate Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, its chair-
man Senator TESTER, our colleagues in 
the House and Senate, multiple VSOs, 
veterans across the country, and vet-
erans in Kansas and their families on 
how we can provide toxic-exposed vet-
erans the healthcare benefits that they 
deserve. 
Chairman TESTER and I made a com-
mitment to each other to get to this 
point today, and we have had a couple 
of procedural hurdles. But, despite 
that, I am pleased that we have still 
brought this bill to the floor in a bipar-
tisan manner. Our veterans have wait-
ed long enough, and it is time to pass 
the Heath Robinson PACT Act. 
Not only will this legislation provide 
long overdue healthcare and benefits to 
the 3.5 million post-9/11 veterans who 
were exposed to burn pits, but this leg-
islation will deliver care for all genera-
tions of veterans, including Vietnam 
veterans and those who served in 
Southeast Asia suffering from the ex-
posure to Agent Orange. 
No legislation is perfect. Is this bill 
the way I would draft it if I were the 
only person writing the bill? It is not. 
It is a legislative process that involves 
a give and take, and we will still have 
more work to do once the legislation is 
signed into law. 
I remain committed to working with 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
with our veterans service organiza-
tions, with individual veterans and 
their families, and with my colleagues

S3849 
August 2, 2022 
here in the Senate, both Republican 
and Democratic, to make certain that 
this legislation is effective for veterans 
and the unintended consequences from 
this legislation are addressed. 
Once we pass legislation, the work 
continues because it then has to be im-
plemented by the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs. I know from experience 
that that is a challenge, and this bill in 
particular—with the magnitude, the 
number 
of 
veterans 
affected, 
the 
amount of resources necessary, the de-
mand for care that will arise under this 
legislation, and the demand for bene-
fits that arises under this legislation— 
will make its implementation a signifi-
cant challenge. But we are ready and 
able to make certain that the intended 
results—while there has been a lot of 
demand that we pass legislation, really 
what we are after are intended results, 
and those intended results are that our 
veterans receive the care and benefits 
that they deserve. 
There is no doubt that the cost of 
caring for our veterans is high, and the 
truth is that freedom is not free. There 
is always a cost to war, and we need to 
remind ourselves that that cost is not 
fully paid when the war ends. 
We are now on the verge of honoring 
that commitment to America’s vet-
erans and their families. I support this 
legislation. I support moving forward 
with a vote in favor of cloture. As to 
something that we thought might have 
happened earlier, I am pleased that 
there will be amendment votes before 
we get to that final passage. I expect 
and urge my colleagues, regardless of 
the outcome of the amendment votes, 
to continue to move this bill forward 
by taking this opportunity to pass the 
bill. 
By taking advantage of the cir-
cumstance we have now worked our 
way to get to, and now that we are at 
this point, I hope that it passes, the 
Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson 
Honoring Our PACT Act, and that, 
with the Presidential signature, it be-
comes law. 
To my colleagues who have worked 
on this, I express my gratitude to my 
colleagues, 
Republicans 
and 
Demo-
crats, on the Committee on Veterans’ 
Affairs. I appreciate the opportunity 
that I have to be in leadership on that 
committee and to work every day on 
behalf of those who have served our Na-
tion. 
Let’s pass this legislation. Let’s de-
liver the most comprehensive toxic ex-
posure package to veterans in our 
country’s history. 
With that plea and suggestion, I yield 
the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I stand 
in front of this body, yet again, to urge 
the passage of the Sergeant First Class 
Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT 
Act. 
Before I get into my remarks, Sen-
ator MORAN is on the floor, and I lis-
tened to a good portion of what he had 
to say. 
I just want to say thank you, Senator 
MORAN. As a team member on the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, for the last 
year and a half, we have been working 
in good faith to get a bill that address-
es the challenges of toxic exposure that 
our veterans, quite honestly, have en-
dured since World War I. With the burn 
pits and Agent Orange and radiation 
exposure that this bill addresses, I 
would just say that we would not be 
here today if we had not both com-
mitted to work together to get to a re-
sult that, hopefully—I was a little 
more sure last week than I am today, 
but, hopefully, we will get to a point 
where this bill passes. 
We have talked about this bill a lot, 
and we have talked about what it does. 
Basically, what it does is to make sure 
that the veterans who have been ex-
posed to toxins—in this case, burn pits 
but also, as I said before, Agent Orange 
and radiation—are made whole again. 
So we get these folks; we train them 
to be warriors; and we send these men 
and women off to war. We tell them to 
go out and protect our freedoms and 
protect this country. They do it, and, 
oftentimes, things happen that change 
their lives. Sometimes those are inju-
ries we can see, and sometimes we 
can’t see them. In this particular case, 
with toxic burn pits, they come home, 
and they have developed disorders be-
cause they have breathed these toxins 
in. 
If anybody has ever been around a 
burning barrel that has plastics in it, 
you know exactly what I am talking 
about. You breathe these toxins in, and 
it causes cancer, and it causes lung 
issues. 
The problem is that these folks 
couldn’t get away. These burn pits 
were right outside the camps; they 
were right next to the chow line; they 
were right next to the beds they slept 
in, and they had to breathe this gar-
bage, sometimes day and night. It has 
resulted in some pretty serious injuries 
that have resulted oftentimes in death. 
Now, the reason I say that is that, 
over the last year and a half, the Sen-
ate’s Veterans’ Affairs Committee has 
had several hearings, and we have had 
witnesses come forth who have been 
impacted by burn pits and toxic expo-
sure. I can tell you that some of those 
folks aren’t with us today. The toxins 
got them. So not only was the vet-
eran’s life ended, which is unfortunate 
in and of itself, but also the family who 
was dependent on that veteran had 
their lives turned upside down. 
So it is time that we set that record 
straight and make sure that those 
folks who have been impacted by war 
are taken care of. I hope that there is 
nobody in this body who thinks that 
that is unreasonable because the truth 
is, I think most of the folks in this 
body have been to the Middle East and 
have seen what a different world that 
is and how it makes me damned glad to 
be a Montanan and to be an American. 
But we have got the ability today to 
step up and do the right thing. There 
have been a lot of claims made over the 
last week or two. I would go into those 
claims and refute those claims, but, 
quite frankly, I don’t see the sense in 
it. If the folks here haven’t read this 
bill and if they haven’t read the letter 
that I sent out to every Senator in this 
body earlier today, I would ask that 
you would. If you have any questions, 
come run me down, and I will answer 
any of them. 
The fact is, we have done this whole 
process in a very transparent manner— 
with no surprises, no last-minute stuff 
put into this bill, no slush funds. This 
is a bill that will work for this coun-
try; that will work for the taxpayers in 
this country; and that will work, most 
importantly, for the veterans and their 
families. 
We have an opportunity, as I said 
last week, to do the right thing today. 
We have an opportunity to have the 
American people be proud of the Sen-
ate and the work they do. I would hope 
we would get a resounding vote on this 
bill, and I would hope that we wouldn’t 
amend it and for it to have to go back 
to the House because that, once again, 
would delay benefits and do real dam-
age to this bill. 
So I would ask my fellow Senators, 
when they come to the floor and vote, 
to think about the veterans who are 
standing outside the Capitol out here, 
to think about the veterans in your 
home State, and to think about the 
veterans whom you met while they 
were on Active Duty on your codels. 
Remember them, and do the right 
thing: vote to pass the Sergeant First 
Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our 
PACT Act. 
I yield back all remaining time.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). On this vote, the yeas are 7, the 
nays are 90. 
Under the previous order requiring 60 
votes for the adoption of this motion to 
concur with amendment, the motion is 
rejected. 
The motion was rejected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question occurs 
on the Toomey motion to concur with 
amendment No. 5186. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, a lot 
has been said about my amendment 
that is completely false, mostly out-
side of this Chamber, so let me say 
very simply what it does. My amend-
ment does only one thing, it would 
maintain 
the 
current 
policy 
of 
classifying currently authorized VA 
healthcare spending as discretionary 
spending, rather than change that clas-
sification going forward to mandatory 
spending as the PACT Act would allow. 
My amendment does not cap any 
spending. It does not reduce veteran 
spending. It does not change the classi-
fication of PACT Act spending. 
But by preventing this change in 
classification, we would prevent a 
budget gimmick that is designed to 
grease the skids for up to $400 billion in 
totally unrelated spending. 
So let’s pass the PACT Act, but let’s 
pass it without enabling an unrelated 
$400 billion spending spree. Support my 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, the 
Toomey amendment does place an arbi-
trary limit on the amount of funding 
that Congress can spend each year in 
support of veterans, those are called 
caps. Don’t take my word for it. That 
comes from the Appropriations Com-
mittee and the Budgets Committee. 
And when you place caps, that results 
in rationing of care. 
Look, just like every other manda-
tory account that the VA has, you 
come forth as part of the President’s 
budget; the VA has to justify it; Con-
gress, Congress, Congress details the 
estimates and needs for the funds, for 
the purpose, whether it is toxic expo-
sure or anything else; it will be re-
viewed as part of the standard appro-
priation process. 
I would recommend, if you don’t 
trust your appropriators, to put some-
body else on the committee, because 
that is what this all comes down to, is 
the appropriators. I would ask you to 
vote no on this amendment.

MOTION TO CONCUR WITH AMENDMENT NO. 5185 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
move to concur in the House amend-
ment 
to 
accompany 
S. 
3373 
with 
amendment No. 5185. 
The

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Tennessee [Mrs. BLACK-
BURN] moves to concur in the House amend-
ment to S. 3373 with an amendment num-
bered 5185. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask the reading be dispensed with. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To require the provision of care 
under the Veterans Community Care Pro-
gram for toxic-exposed veterans) 
On page 15, between lines 14 and 15, insert 
the following: 
SEC. 105. REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CARE 
UNDER 
VETERANS 
COMMUNITY 
CARE 
PROGRAM 
FOR 
TOXIC-EX-
POSED VETERANS. 
Section 1703(d)(1) is amended— 
(1) in subparagraph (D), by striking ‘‘; or’’ 
and inserting a semicolon; 
(2) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period 
at the end and inserting ‘‘; or’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraph: 
‘‘(F) the covered veteran is a toxic-exposed 
veteran.’’. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
this is the amendment that will allow 
our veterans to immediately move into 
community care. Our veterans need to 
be able to have access to the care, not 
just access to the queue. 
The VA will have a problem getting 
this implemented because the current 
wait time to see a primary care doctor 
is 100 days. So let’s not make them 
wait. Let’s give them access to commu-
nity care so that they have the care 
they have earned and they deserve. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. The Blackburn amend-
ment would provide automatic eligi-
bility to community care for any toxic- 
exposed veteran for any condition. 
However, I want to make it clear that 
if a veteran should ever need care the 
VA cannot provide, they are automati-
cally eligible in that case. 
We can talk about the cost. We can 
talk about the accountability. We 
could talk about the timelines of going 
into the private sector. Unfortunately,

we don’t have those times, and we 
don’t have those metrics, but what we 
do know is this. The VA is a leader in 
healthcare in treating our veterans for 
diseases and conditions as a result of 
their military service, and more than 
that, time after time after time again, 
we have heard that veterans prefer get-
ting their care from the VA. We should 
not privatize the VA. That is what this 
amendment is about. I would appre-
ciate a ‘‘no’’ vote.

AMENDMENTS WITHDRAWN 
Under the previous order, the motion

amendment No. 5148 and the amend-
ments pending thereto are withdrawn. 
The Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, we are 
poised once again with the opportunity 
to pass a piece of legislation of historic 
significance, 
something 
that 
dem-
onstrates the U.S. Senate can come to-
gether and take care of Americans, 
particularly those who served our Na-
tion. 
While it is historic, it is more impor-
tant to many individuals—historic for 
the country, historic for veterans, but 
important, lifesaving, supportive of 
those who have encountered toxic ex-
posure from Vietnam and Southeast 
Asia 
through 
Agent 
Orange 
and 
through burn pits in Iraq and Afghani-
stan. 
Mr. President, I thank the Heath 
Robinson family and all the advocates 
who got us to this point today. I ask 
my colleagues to pass this legislation, 
and I ask the President to sign it as 
quickly as possible. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, 15 years 
ago, when I was appointed to the Sen-
ate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I had 
a Vietnam veteran come up to me and 
say: ‘‘You are not going to treat this 
generation of veterans like you have 
treated us.’’ This bill rights that and 
makes that veteran’s request come 
true. Why? Because we are dealing with 
toxic exposure. In fact, we are even 
dealing with it with Agent Orange and 
the burn pits. 
This fully pays the cost of war, and I 
would encourage everybody in this 
body to vote for this motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this 
long-awaited moment for our Nation’s 
veterans is occurring now. The Senate 
is finally—finally—going to pass the 
most significant expansion of veteran 
healthcare 
benefits 
in 
generations. 
This is a very good day, a long-awaited 
day, a day that should have happened 
long ago. 
For decades, many of our Nation’s 
veterans have endured a shameful re-
ality. They went abroad to serve our 
country bravely, got sick from toxic 
exposure in the line of duty, but came 
home and learned they didn’t qualify 
for the benefits they needed to treat 
their illnesses. It is shameful. It is in-
furiating. 
Today, we tell our veterans suffering 
from cancers, lung diseases, and other 
ailments from burn pits: The wait is 
over for the benefits you deserve. No 
more pointless delays on getting the 
healthcare you need. No more jumping 
through hoops and even hiring lawyers 
just to get an answer from the VA. 
Today, if you are a veteran—from 
Vietnam to Iraq, to Afghanistan, to ev-
erywhere in between—and you get sick 
from burn pit exposure or Agent Or-
ange, you will finally be able to get 
your earned benefits guaranteed. 
I want to thank my colleagues from 
both sides of the aisle for working to-
gether to push the PACT Act over the 
line, especially Senators TESTER and 
MORAN, who were the original leaders 
of the bill, my colleague Senator GILLI-
BRAND from New York, and I thank in 
advance all my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle who will vote for this 
much needed legislation. 
Importantly, I want to thank the 
many veterans, veterans service orga-
nizations, and advocates, like Jon 
Stewart and John Feal, who led a 
righteous, mighty movement to get 
this bill done. It wouldn’t have hap-
pened without you. 
Especially, I want to thank the vet-
erans who camped at the foot of Cap-
itol Hill for the past few days, enduring 
scorching heat and drenching rain just 
to get to this point. They said they 
would never go home until they got 
this bill done. They are here. 
Well, I have good news. In a few min-
utes, after this bill passes, you can go 
home knowing the good and great 
thing you have done and accomplished 
for the United States of America. 
Because of them, veterans every-
where will finally get the dignity and 
care they deserve. 
The PACT Act is now going to the 
President’s desk. 
I thank my colleagues for their work, 
and I ask for the yeas and nays.

happen who are observing it. Thank 
you, thank you, thank you, thank you. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate be in a period of morning busi-
ness for debate only and with Senators 
permitted to speak therein for up to 10 
minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATO 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now, I am about to lock in an agree-
ment that will allow the Senate to pass 
the resolution of ratification for the 
Finnish and Swedish applications to 
join NATO. Our NATO alliance is the 
bedrock that has guaranteed democ-
racy in the Western World since World 
War II. This strengthens NATO even 
further and is particularly needed in 
the light of recent Russian aggression. 
When Leader MCCONNELL and I met 
with the Finnish President and Swed-
ish Prime Minister in May, we com-
mitted to do this as fast as we could 
and certainly before we go home for 
the August recess. 
With the help of Chair MENENDEZ, 
Ranking Member RISCH, Senator SHA-
HEEN, and Senator TILLIS, we were able 
to get to this point. 
I appreciate their hard work and bi-
partisan work. I know Leader MCCON-
NELL does too. For the awareness of my 
colleagues, I invited the Ambassadors 
from Finland and Sweden to join us in 
the Gallery during our debate and 
votes tomorrow. 
f 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. And so now, I ask 
unanimous consent that on Wednesday, 
August 3, 2022, at 1:30 p.m., the Senate 
proceed to executive session to con-
sider Calendar No. 5, treaty document 
117–3; that the treaties be considered as 
having advanced through the various 
parliamentary stages up to and includ-
ing the presentation of the resolution 
of advice and consent to ratification; 
that there be 3 hours for debate, equal-
ly divided between the two leaders or 
their designees, on the treaties and res-
olution of advice and consent to ratifi-
cation; that the only amendments in 
order to the resolution of advice and 
consent to ratification be the fol-
lowing: Sullivan 5191, Paul 5192; that 
following the debate, the Senate vote 
in relation to the amendments in the 
order listed; and that upon disposition 
of the amendments, any committee 
conditions, declarations, or reserva-
tions be agreed to as applicable, and 
the Senate vote on the resolution of 
advice and consent to ratification as 
amended, if amended, with no inter-
vening action or debate; that if the res-
olution of advice and consent to ratifi-
cation is agreed to, the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table; that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action, and the Senate then resume

f 
PACT ACT OF 2022 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, 86 to 
11. 86 to 11. We have been fighting for 
this for decades—for decades. And I 
will tell you that the last few days 
have not been particularly easy for me, 
and they have been even more difficult 
for the veterans around this Nation 
who thought they had a benefit on 
June 16 and then found out that it 
wasn’t there. 
But today, the Senate took the his-
toric step of delivering healthcare and 
benefits to all eras of veterans by the 
passage of the Sergeant First Class 
Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise 
to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, 
otherwise known as the PACT Act. 
For hundreds of thousands of vet-
erans of all generations, for our all-vol-
unteer military, this bill puts us on a 
path to finally paying the cost of war. 
Look, I take my cues from the vet-
erans as chairman of the Senate Vet-
erans Affairs Committee. When I first 
introduced this bill last year, we set 
out with a clear goal to right the 
wrongs of decades of inaction and fail-
ure by us—the U.S. Government—to 
provide all eras of toxic-exposed vet-
erans the VA care and benefits that 
they have earned. 
We knew the only way to do this was 
to put forth a comprehensive package 
that took care of our past, present, and 
future veterans. I am grateful—and I 
mean this—this wouldn’t have hap-
pened without my good friends Rank-
ing Member JERRY MORAN, JOHN BOOZ-
MAN, and MARTIN
HEINRICH. We all 
worked together to make sure that this 
toxic exposure package came together 
so we could have the vote we had 
today, with help from both sides of the 
aisle. 
I am thankful for the leadership of 
President Joe Biden who addressed this 
issue in his State of the Union speech 
and got the ball rolling; to the VA Sec-
retary, Denis McDonough, for his lead-
ership as Secretary of the VA, and the 
House 
Veterans 
Affairs 
Committee 
chairman, MARK TAKANO, and so many 
others that I can’t even list them all, 
so I am not going to start down this 
line. 
This bill is legislation we envisioned 
when we set out to right wrongs of our 
toxic-exposed veterans. The PACT Act 
recognizes that responsibility, and it 
recognizes the cost of war. 
Veterans service organizations across 
this country and the veterans they rep-
resent and the advocates have under-
stood this for a long time. That is why 
not only have they been incredible 
partners in this, but that is why this 
has been the No. 1 issue for veterans 
service organizations in this country— 
the No. 1 issue. 
And, in fact, so important to them 
and the folks that pretty much left 
here—the Chamber—but it is so impor-
tant to them that they were willing to 
sleep on the steps of the Capitol for the 
last 5 days. Now, you might not think 
that is a big deal, but it isn’t exactly 
nice in Washington, DC, the 1st of Au-
gust or the end of July. 
And last night, we had one heck of a 
thunderstorm, rolled me right out of 
bed. Those folks were out there. They 
were making their names be heard. 
They were making the policies be 
heard that they fought for. 
And I am just going to say one more 
thing: If you take a look at our mili-
tary, the finest in the world, there is a 
reason for that. There is a reason for 
that. And that reason is these folks are 
willing to get the job done, and they 
did. And that is why we got a vote of 86 
to 11. 
That is why folks said: Enough is 
enough. We are not doing any more 
games; we are going to vote on this 
bill. That is what the folks sent us here 
to Washington, DC, to do, and we did 
it. 
And I couldn’t be prouder of the U.S. 
Senate, but I am also more proud of 
the folks who served this country in 
the military and their families. I got 
on this floor earlier today and said: 
The longer we delay, the longer we are 
going to deny healthcare for our vet-
erans and veterans are going to con-
tinue to be in crisis and they are going 
to continue to die. Now, we have passed 
the bill that rights that wrong, that is 
going to help these veterans across the 
board. And I think we are going to see 
improvement in all sorts of things—not 
only the diseases caused by toxic expo-
sure, but the mental health that is also 
associated with service to this country.

August 2, 2022 
We put politics aside. We delivered 
results through action, through real 
action. And we said thank you to the 
men and women who have served in our 
military. Thank you for what you have 
done for this country. Thank you for 
protecting our freedoms. Thank you for 
keeping us safe. 
And most importantly, we told them 
you held up your end of the bargain; we

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
wanted to come down to the floor and 
say a few words about the so-called In-
flation Reduction Act, which may be 
coming to the floor this week. 
But before I do, I want to put this 
reconciliation bill into the context of 
where we are as a nation from a polit-
ical perspective. And where we are is 
not a good place to be. 
According to the most recent Gallup 
poll, the approval rate for Congress is 
at 16 percent with massive numbers of 
people disapproving of the work we are 
doing here. Further, according to a re-
cent University of Chicago poll, a 
strong majority of Americans believe 
that the government is ‘‘corrupt and 
rigged against me.’’ That is how people 
perceive the government. 
Further, according to a recent USA 
TODAY poll, a very strong majority no 
longer believe that the Democratic or 
Republican Parties are responding to 
their needs, and we have to move away 
from 
a 
two-party 
system 
to 
a 
multiparty system. 
And most frighteningly, there is a 
growing number of Americans who ac-
tually believe that they have to take 
up arms—literally become violent— 
against their own government in order 
to accomplish what they think needs 
to be done. And, of course, we saw an 
example of that on January 6 of last 
year, with the terrible violence and 
deaths that occurred. 
All of this speaks to a very dangerous 
moment for American democracy and 
in some ways resembles the conditions 
that existed in Europe in the late 1920s 
and early 1930s, which eventually led to 
fascism and totalitarianism. 
And I should mention that, as we 
speak right now, while working fami-
lies and the middle class are falling 
further and further behind economi-
cally, the billionaires in this country, 
through their super PACs, are doing 
everything that they can to elect Mem-
bers of Congress who will support the 
wealthy and powerful against the needs 
of average Americans. In both parties, 
huge amounts of money from billion-
aires are coming into campaigns to 
elect the candidates who will represent 
the 1 percent. 
The people of this country believe, in 
my view correctly, that we have a cor-
rupt political system dominated by the 
wealthy and powerful and that we have 
a rigged economy, in which large cor-
porations are seeing massive increases 
in their profits while the middle class 
and working families of the country 
continue to see a decline in their 
standard of living. 
We don’t talk about it much here in 
the Senate or in the corporate media, 
but at this moment in American his-
tory, we have more income and wealth 
inequality than at any time in the last 
100 years. 
Now, I know we are not allowed to 
talk about it. It is not fashionable. We 
might offend some wealthy campaign 
contributors. But today, obscenely, 
you have got three people who own 
more wealth than the bottom half of 
American society. You have the top 1 
percent owning more wealth than the 
bottom 92 percent; you have 45 percent 
of all new income going to the 1 per-
cent; and you have got CEOs of major 
corporations making 350 times more 
than average workers. 
In other words, the people in the mid-
dle, working people, struggling; people 
on top doing phenomenally well, and 
the people on the top have enough 
money to elect candidates who rep-
resent their interests. 
And that is the overall context, in 
my view, in which this reconciliation 
bill is coming to the floor. 
Now, I have heard from some of my 
colleagues that the Build Back Better 
legislation passed by the U.S. House of 
Representatives and supported by some 
48 out of 50 Members of the Senate 
Democratic caucus and by the Presi-
dent of the United States is dead; it is 
not going anywhere; can’t get the 50 
notes that are needed. 
Now, I don’t know if that is abso-
lutely true or not, but I do know that 
if it is true, it would be a disaster for 
the working families of our country 
who, today, are desperately trying to 
survive economically. 
So let me briefly review what was in 
the original Build Back Better plan 
and contrast it with what is in the so- 
called Inflation Reduction Act. 
And I should mention that every one 
of the provisions that I will briefly be 
discussing has overwhelming support 
from the American people according to 
poll after poll after poll. In other 
words, that is what the American peo-
ple want. 
At a time when the United States has 
the highest rate of childhood poverty, 
shamefully, of almost any major na-
tion on Earth, this reconciliation bill 
that will soon be coming to the floor 
does not extend the $300-a-month-per- 
child tax credit that working parents 
of this country had last year. That is 
gone. That is not in this bill. 
If you are a parent today, paying 
$15,000 a year for childcare—which is 
what it costs in Vermont and is about 
the average cost all over America, 
$15,000 a year to have a kid in 
childcare—this bill completely ignores 
that crisis and does absolutely nothing 
for you. 
And, of course, unlike the original 
Build Back Better plan, this bill does 
not provide free and universal pre-K. 
So if you are a working parent right 
now, struggling to pay for childcare, 
this bill turns its back on you. 
At a time when 45 million Americans 
are struggling to pay student debt and 
when hundreds of thousands of bright, 
young people every year are unable to 
afford to go to college and get a higher 
education, this bill ignores that reality 
and does nothing for these young peo-
ple. 
The original Build Back Better plan 
did not go as far as I wanted it to, but 
it would have provided 2 years of free 
education at a community college. 
That is a big deal for millions of young 
people, but that is no longer going to 
happen. 
If you are an elderly American—one 
of the millions of elderly people trying 
to survive on your Social Security ben-
efits—and you cannot afford to go to a 
dentist and your teeth are rotting in 
your mouth or you have no teeth so 
that you can digest your food or you 
can’t afford to get a hearing aid to 
communicate with your kids or grand-
children or you can’t afford the eye-
glasses that you need, this bill does 
nothing, zero, to expand Medicare to 
cover these very basic healthcare needs 
that the American people want to see 
covered. 
As a result, millions of seniors will 
continue to have rotten teeth and lack 
of dentures, lack of hearing aids or eye-
glasses that they deserve. 
Further, at a time when millions of 
elderly and disabled Americans would 
prefer to stay in their homes rather 
than be forced to go into a nursing 
home, this bill does absolutely nothing 
to address the very, very serious home 
healthcare crisis in our country. We 
will continue to lack the decent-paid, 
decent-trained staffing that we need to 
address the home healthcare crisis. 
This bill ignores that issue completely. 
I think there is no disagreement on 
the part of anybody that we have a 
major housing crisis in this country. 
Some 600,000 people are homeless in 
America, sleeping out on the streets all 
across this country, including a few 
blocks away from the Capitol. 
In addition to that, some 18 million 
households in our country are spending 
an incredible 50 percent of their in-
comes for housing. 
Yep, you guessed it. This bill does 
nothing to address the major housing 
crisis that exists in State after State 
after State all across the country. We 
are ignoring that major issue as well. 
One of the criticisms made against 
the original Build Back Better plan is 
that it would be inflationary because it

would increase Federal spending. That 
criticism is untrue. Every nickel spent 
on that bill would have been fully paid 
for by increased taxes on the wealthy 
and large corporations. Unlike the re-
cently passed microchip corporate wel-
fare bill that adds $79 billion to the 
Federal deficit, unlike the proposed 
military budget that came out of the 
Senate Armed Forces Committee re-
cently, which would increase defense 
spending by 45 billion more than the 
Pentagon even requested, the Build 
Back Better plan would not have in-
creased the deficit at all. 
Now, let me say a few words about 
what is in this legislation, a bill which, 
in my view, has some good features but 
also has some very bad features. 
One of the issues that it deals with is 
prescription drugs, and the good news 
is that the reconciliation bill finally 
begins to lower the outrageous price of 
some of the most expensive prescrip-
tion drugs under Medicare. 
According to the most recent data, if 
we do nothing, Medicare will spend 
about 1.8 trillion over the next decade 
on prescription drugs, and our Nation 
as a whole will spend $5 trillion. And 
that is not only outrageous, but it is 
unsustainable. 
But here is the bad news: The pre-
scription drug provisions in this bill 
are extremely weak, and it is hard to 
deny that. They are extremely com-
plex; they take too long to go into ef-
fect; and they go nowhere near as far 
as they should to take on the greed of 
the pharmaceutical industry, whose ac-
tions are literally killing Americans. 
One out of five Americans today can-
not afford the prescription drugs their 
doctors prescribed, and some of them 
will die. 
Under this legislation, Medicare—for 
the first time in history—would be able 
to negotiate with the pharmaceutical 
industry to lower drug prices, and that 
is the good news. 
The bad news is that the negotiated 
prices would not go into effect until 
2026, 4 years from now. So you are not 
going to see any changes over the next 
4 years. 
Further, in 2026, only 10 drugs—10 
drugs—would be negotiated, with more 
to come in later years. Moreover, with 
the possible exception of insulin, this 
bill does nothing to lower prescription 
drug prices for anyone who is not on 
Medicare. 
Under this bill, at a time when the 
pharmaceutical companies are making 
outrageous profits, the drug companies 
will still be allowed to charge the 
American people, by far, the highest 
prices in the world for prescription 
drugs. 
I recently—not recently. A couple of 
years ago, I took a trip with some mid-
westerners over the border into Canada 
where they purchased insulin for one- 
tenth of the price that was being 
charged in the United States because 
in Canada, like virtually every other 
country 
on 
Earth, 
they 
negotiate 
prices with the industry. 
If we are really serious about reduc-
ing the price of prescription drugs, 
something that the American people 
desperately want us to do, it is no se-
cret as to how we can achieve that 
goal. For over 30 years, the Veterans’ 
Administration—and I am very proud 
of the legislation that we just passed a 
moment ago for the VA—but the VA 
has been negotiating with the pharma-
ceutical industry to lower the price of 
prescription drugs. They have been 
doing it for 30 years—not a new idea. 
Moreover, 
for 
decades, 
virtually 
every other major country on Earth 
has been doing exactly the same thing, 
which is why the price of prescription 
drugs in Canada, Mexico, all over Eu-
rope is far less expensive than in the 
United States. The result of where we 
are today is that Medicare pays twice 
as much for the exact same prescrip-
tion drugs as the VA, and Americans, 
in some cases, may pay 10 times more 
for a particular drug as the people of 
any major country on Earth. 
So you have the absurd situation 
where one government Agency, the VA, 
because they have been negotiating 
drugs—all drugs—for 30 years, pays half 
of what Medicare is paying today. In 
other words, if we are going to solve 
this problem when it comes to reducing 
the price of prescription drugs under 
Medicare, we don’t have to reinvent 
the wheel; we could simply require 
Medicare to pay no more for prescrip-
tion drugs than the VA. If we did that, 
we could literally cut the price of pre-
scription drugs under Medicare in half. 
We could cut the price in half in a mat-
ter of months, not years. 
In February, I introduced legislation 
with Senator KLOBUCHAR that would do 
exactly that. Under that legislation, 
we could save Medicare $900 billion 
over the next decade. That is nine 
times more savings than the rather 
weak negotiation provisions in this 
bill. 
By the way, with those enormous 
savings, we could expand Medicare to 
provide comprehensive dental, vision, 
and hearing benefits to every senior in 
America. It could be used, furthermore, 
to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 
at least 60, and it could be used to ex-
tend the solvency of Medicare. That is 
what we could do with those savings 
that we are not achieving under this 
proposed bill. 
What are the other prescription drug 
provisions in the reconciliation bill? 
Well, under this legislation, pharma-
ceutical companies would essentially 
be prohibited from increasing prescrip-
tion drug prices above inflation pegged 
to the year 2021. 
Should we be making sure that phar-
maceutical companies cannot increase 
their prices above general inflation? 
Yes. But let us be clear. This provision 
would lock in all of the extraordinary 
price increases the pharmaceutical in-
dustry has made in recent years and 
would do nothing to lower those out-
rageously high prices. It would control 
costs in the future, limiting what the 
industry could charge, but it would not 
lower prices. 
Under this legislation, out-of-pocket 
prescription drug costs for seniors 
would be capped at $2,000 a year, and 
that is a good benefit which will ben-
efit up to 2 million seniors who cur-
rently pay over $2,000 a year for pre-
scription drugs, often people who are 
dealing with cancer and with other 
very serious illnesses that require ex-
pensive drugs. But the $25 billion cost 
of that provision will not be paid for by 
the pharmaceutical industry, which is 
making 
recordbreaking 
profits. 
In 
other words, we are going to cap the 
price. Guess who is paying for it. You 
got it. It will be paid for by increased 
premiums on virtually every senior cit-
izen in America, although there is a 
provision to smooth out those premium 
increases. 
The current reconciliation bill that 
we are looking at would also provide 
free vaccines for seniors—the only pop-
ulation for which vaccines are not al-
ready free—and this is a good thing, 
something we should have done a long 
time ago. 
Finally, in terms of prescription 
drugs, it looks like the reconciliation 
bill will cap copays for insulin at $35 a 
month, which is a good step forward for 
people with health insurance but will 
do nothing to lower the cost of insulin 
for the 1.6 million diabetics who are 
currently uninsured and, in fact, need 
our help the most. 
So the bill does some things in terms 
of prescription drugs but nowhere near 
enough given the crisis that we face. 
In terms of the Affordable Care Act, 
this legislation will extend subsidies 
for some 13 million Americans who 
have private health insurance plans as 
a result of the Affordable Care Act, and 
they will be extended over the next 3 
years. Without this provision, millions 
of Americans would see their premiums 
skyrocket, and some 3 million Ameri-
cans could lose their healthcare alto-
gether. 
So this is a good provision, but let us 
not fool ourselves. The $64 billion cost 
of this provision will go directly into 
the pockets of private health insurance 
companies that made over $60 billion in 
profits last year and paid their execu-
tives exorbitant compensation pack-
ages. It would also do nothing to help 
the more than 70 million Americans 
today who are uninsured or under-
insured. There are the estimates out 
there now that some 60,000 people in 
our country die every year because 
they don’t get to a doctor when they 
should because they are uninsured or 
underinsured. 
So this bill does nothing—absolutely 
nothing—to reform a dysfunctional, 
broken healthcare system which is 
based on the greed of the insurance in-
dustry. It does nothing to address the 
fundamental crisis of the United States 
paying by far the highest prices in the 
world for healthcare, let alone the 70 
million of us who are uninsured or 
underinsured. It doesn’t even touch 
that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3855 
August 2, 2022 
Madam President, let me say a word 
about climate change and what this 
bill does and does not do. 
This legislation provides $370 billion 
over the next decade to combat climate 
change and to invest in so-called en-
ergy security programs. The good news 
is that if this legislation were to be 
signed into law, it would provide far 
more funding for energy efficiency and 
sustainable energy than has ever been 
invested by the government before. 
That is the good news. This is, how-
ever, substantially lower than the $555 
billion in the original Build Back Bet-
ter plan, which understood that cli-
mate change is an existential threat to 
this planet, and it must be addressed in 
an extremely bold way if we are going 
to leave a country and world in which 
our kids and grandchildren can thrive. 
But this legislation does provide seri-
ous funding for wind, solar, batteries, 
heat pumps, electric vehicles, energy- 
efficient appliances, and low-income 
communities that have borne the brunt 
of climate change. That is the good 
news. But the very bad news that very 
few people in the media or in Congress 
want to talk about is that this pro-
posed legislation includes a huge give-
away to the fossil fuel industry, both 
in the reconciliation bill itself and the 
side deal that was just made public 
yesterday. 
Under this legislation, the fossil fuel 
industry will receive billions of dollars 
in new tax breaks and subsidies over 
the next 10 years on top of the $15 bil-
lion in tax breaks and corporate wel-
fare they are already receiving. 
In my view, if we are going to make 
our planet healthy and habitable for 
future generations, we cannot provide 
billions of dollars in new tax breaks to 
the very same fossil fuel companies 
that are currently destroying the plan-
et. Think about it. At a time when the 
scientists all over the world tell us 
that we have to break our dependence 
on fossil fuel, this legislation provides 
billions in new tax breaks to fossil fuel 
companies. In my view, instead of giv-
ing them more tax breaks, we should 
end all of the massive corporate wel-
fare that the fossil fuel industry al-
ready enjoys. 
Under this legislation, up to 60 mil-
lion acres of public waters must be of-
fered up for sale each and every year to 
the oil and gas industry before the Fed-
eral Government could approve any 
new offshore wind development. To put 
that into perspective, 60 million acres 
is the size of the State of Michigan. 
That is a lot of territory. 
Let me read to you the headline that 
appeared in a July 29 article in 
Bloomberg: ‘‘Exxon . . . Loves What 
Manchin Did for Big Oil in $370 Billion 
Deal.’’ According to Bloomberg, the 
CEO of ExxonMobil called the rec-
onciliation bill ‘‘a step in the right di-
rection’’ and was ‘‘pleased’’ with a 
comprehensive set of solutions in-
cluded in this proposed legislation. 
Barron’s 
recently 
reported 
that 
ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Occidental 
Petroleum are just a few of the fossil 
fuel companies that could benefit the 
most under this bill. 
Now, if the CEO of ExxonMobil—a 
company that has done as much as any 
entity 
to 
destroy 
this 
planet—is 
‘‘pleased’’ with this bill, then I think 
all of us should have some very deep 
concerns about what is in this legisla-
tion. 
Further, under this bill, up to 2 mil-
lion acres of public lands must be of-
fered up for sale each and every year to 
the oil and gas industry before leases 
can move forward for any new energy 
development on public lands. In total, 
this bill would offer the fossil fuel in-
dustry up to 700 million acres of public 
lands and waters, going to oil and gas 
drilling over the next decade—far more 
than the oil and gas industry could 
possibly use. 
That is not all. The fossil fuel indus-
try will not just benefit from the provi-
sions in the reconciliation bill; a deal 
has also been reached to make it easier 
for the fossil fuel industry to receive 
permits for their oil and gas projects. 
This deal would approve the $6.6 billion 
Mountain Valley Pipeline—a fracked 
gas pipeline that would span 303 miles 
from West Virginia to Virginia and po-
tentially on to North Carolina. This is 
a pipeline that would generate emis-
sions equivalent to those released by 37 
coal plants or by over 27 million cars 
each and every year. It seems to be a 
very strange way to combat climate 
change. 
Let me quote a statement from 
350.org, one of the leading environ-
mental groups in the country on this 
subject. They say: 
This latest bill has a few good pieces: 
lengthening the tax credits for green energy 
projects from two to ten years to ensure 
steady growth in the wind and solar indus-
try; providing incentives for consumers to 
buy electric vehicles; and installing heat 
pumps to make green energy use more wide-
spread. However, the amount of giveaways to 
the fossil fuel industry . . . is so wide in 
scope, that it turns all the gains in address-
ing the climate crisis into a moot point. 
That is from 350.org. 
Here is what the Center for Biologi-
cal Diversity had to say on this bill: 
This is a climate suicide pact. It’s self-de-
feating to handcuff renewable energy devel-
opment to massive new oil and gas extrac-
tion. The new leasing required in this bill 
will fan the flames of the climate disasters 
torching our country, and it’s a slap in the 
face to the communities fighting to protect 
themselves from filthy fossil fuels. 
That is from the Center for Biologi-
cal Diversity. 
In my view, we have to do everything 
possible to take on the greed of the fos-
sil fuel industry, not give billions of 
dollars in corporate welfare to an in-
dustry whose emissions are causing 
massive damage today and will only 
make this situation worse in the fu-
ture. 
In the reconciliation bill, there is a 
provision regarding tax reform. Let me 
say a word on that. 
At a time of massive income and 
wealth inequality, at a time of soaring 
corporate profits, at a time in which 
we have a broken tax system, riddled 
with all kinds of loopholes for the rich 
and the powerful, this bill makes a few 
modest changes to reform the Tax 
Code. 
Under this bill, corporations will be 
required to pay a minimum tax of 15 
percent. That is the good news. The 
American people are sick and tired of 
companies like AT&T, Federal Express, 
and Nike making billions of dollars in 
profit in a given year and paying noth-
ing—zero—in Federal income tax. This 
provision has been estimated to raise 
over $300 billion over the next decade. 
Further, under this bill, the IRS will 
finally begin to receive the funding 
that it needs to audit wealthy tax 
cheats. Each and every year, the top 1 
percent are able to avoid paying $160 
billion in taxes that they legally owe 
because the IRS does not have the re-
sources and the staffing they need to 
conduct 
audits 
of 
the 
extremely 
wealthy. This bill begins to change 
that. 
This bill would also make a very 
modest change to the so-called carried 
interest loophole that has allowed bil-
lionaire hedge fund managers on Wall 
Street to pay a lower tax rate than a 
nurse, teacher, or firefighter. 
But the bad news is that, while there 
are some positive aspects for the tax 
provisions in this bill, this bill does 
nothing to repeal the Trump tax 
breaks that went to the very wealthy 
and large corporations. Trump’s 2017 
tax bill provided over $1 trillion in tax 
breaks to the top 1 percent and large 
corporations. In fact, 83 percent of the 
benefits of the Trump tax law are going 
to the top 1 percent—83 percent of the 
benefits—and this bill repeals none of 
those benefits. They remain in exist-
ence. 
Let us not forget that it is very like-
ly that Congress will be doing a so- 
called tax extenders bill at the end of 
the year that could provide corpora-
tions with up to $400 billion over the 
next decade in new tax breaks. If that 
occurs, that would more than offset the 
$313 billion in corporate revenue in-
cluded in this bill. 
So that is where we are today. We 
have legislation which, unlike the 
original Build Back Better plan, ig-
nores the needs of the working families 
of our country in childcare, pre-K, the 
expansion of Medicare, affordable hous-
ing, home healthcare, higher edu-
cation, and many, many other des-
perate needs that families all across 
this country are facing. 
This is legislation which, at a time of 
massive profits for the pharmaceutical 
industry—and we pay, by far, the high-
est prices in the world for prescription 
drugs—takes some very modest steps 
to lower or control the price of medi-
cine. 
This is legislation which has some 
good and important provisions per-
taining to energy efficiency and sus-
tainable energy but, at the same time,

destroying the planet. 
This

legislation 
which 
appro-
priately ends the absurdity of large, 
profitable corporations paying nothing 
in Federal income tax but, at the same 
time, leaves intact virtually all of 
Trump’s tax breaks for the wealthy 
and large corporations. 
This more than 700-page bill, after 
months of secret negotiations, became 
public late last week. A 700-page bill, 
after months of secret negotiations, 
was made public last week. In my view, 
now is the time for every Member of 
the Senate to study this bill thor-
oughly and to come up with amend-
ments and suggestions as to how we 
can improve it. I look forward to being 
part of that process and working with 
my colleagues to make that happen. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
f 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, every once in a while, life gives 
you a wonderful coincidence. The won-
derful coincidence this evening is that 
I have had the pleasure of listening to 
Senator SANDERS describe what hap-
pens to a country when billionaires are 
able to secretly exert immense polit-
ical power and drive democracy away 
from its foundations and into the serv-
ice of the billionaires. 
The remarks I am here to give are 
about how they do it—the technique 
for infiltration and influence of our de-
mocracy by the billionaires. This is 
part of my series of ‘‘Scheme’’ speech-
es, which is about how they have taken 
over the Supreme Court—captured it— 
in the same way that, in the 1800s, big 
railroads captured the railroad com-
missions that were supposed to set 
their rates. They just had their people 
set the rules for them, and it worked 
great. We are seeing this with the Su-
preme Court right now. This is not a 
conservative Supreme Court. This is a 
captive Supreme Court—captive to spe-
cial interests—and the technique that 
they use for getting there is to hide 
who they are through an array of front 
groups. 
There are dozens of front groups that 
were involved in the Court-capture 
scheme. The Washington Post did a 
very good review of them several years 
ago and calculated, based on informa-
tion they could get at the time, that 
this 
was 
a 
quarter-billion-dollar 
project—$250 million. Well, the re-
search 
continued, 
and 
folks 
kept 
digging. When I held a hearing about 
this 
in 
my 
Judiciary 
court 
sub-
committee, the number had climbed to 
$400 million spent on the Court-capture 
enterprise. They have kept digging and 
kept digging, and now it turns out the 
number is over $580 million. Over a half 
a billion dollars was spent in this effort 
to capture and control the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
I don’t think you spend over $580 mil-
lion unless you have a purpose, and 
very often, the purpose is to make that 
much money back and more. There is a 
web of front groups that are used to de-
ploy all of that money, and this is just 
a part of that web. This is just one sort 
of combined creature in that web. So 
let me take a few minutes and just go 
through the different organs and limbs 
of this creature. 
The center of it is a pair of organiza-
tions, the 85 Fund and the Concord 
Fund. The way that extremely wealthy 
people play in politics these days is to 
put two organizations together that 
they establish under the Tax Code. One 
is called a 501(c)(3), which is named 
after the section of the Tax Code under 
which it is established. The 501(c)(3) 
gives you two wonderful things if you 
are fiddling in politics. One, it gives us 
anonymity, wherein you don’t have to 
disclose your donors; and, two, it gives 
you a tax deduction. You get to write 
off the money that you give to manipu-
late the American public. But you 
can’t do something very important 
with a 501(c)(3): You can’t go out and 
manipulate public opinion. You can’t 
participate in elections. So, when you 
do that, you need to have something 
else called a 501(c)(4), the very next 
provision in the IRS Code. So you take 
your 501(c)(3), and you take your 
501(c)(4), and you set them both up. 
In my view, there is usually no real 
distinction between the two. There is a 
doctrine in law called piercing the cor-
porate veil that separates separate cor-
porate entities, that allows people who 
are trying to pursue usually damages 
to show that this is a fake corporate 
division. You pierce the corporate veil. 
The 501(c)(3)s and 501(c)(4)s are a cor-
porate veil that you could probably 
pierce with a banana. They have the 
same locations; they have the same 
mailing addresses; they have the same 
staff; they have the same board mem-
bers; they have the same funders. It is 
essentially the same organization, but 
it just operates under two legal struc-
tures. 
So that is what you have for starters. 
You have got your twinned front 
groups. The 85 Fund is your 501(c)(3), 
and the Concord Fund is your 501(c)(4). 
They are essentially the same creature, 
but in this case, this organism has 
other limbs. So what you can do under 
Virginia corporate law is, if you are 
the 85 Fund or the Concord Fund, you 
could file with the corporate registry 
in the State of Virginia permission to 
operate under what is called a ficti-
tious name. You can operate under 
your own name, the 85 Fund, or you 
can file, with permission, a fictitious 
name. I am not making that up. That 
is actually the word in Virginia law—a 
‘‘fictitious name.’’ 
Well, the 85 Fund filed for permission 
to operate under the fictitious name of 
the Judicial Education Project—the 
501(c)(3) that takes in money, and ‘‘tax 
deductibly,’’ to work on the capture of 
the Court. On the other side, over here, 
the 
Concord 
Fund, 
your 
twinned 
501(c)(4), has its own twinned fictitious 
name. 
So 
the 
Judicial 
Education 
Project has its own little twin in the 
Judicial Crisis Network. 
Well, what do we know about the Ju-
dicial Crisis Network? 
We know that it took checks for as 
much as $15, $17 million from secret do-
nors. Imagine writing a $15 million 
check to an organization like this. It 
took that money, and it first ran cam-
paigns to attack Merrick Garland, to 
round up Republican support for oppos-
ing him as a Supreme Court Justice. 
Then, when that was successful and 
they brought on Judge Gorsuch, in 
came other big checks. Then, when 
Gorsuch was on the Court and it was 
time for Kavanaugh—other big checks. 
Then, when it was time for Amy Coney 
Barrett—other big checks. We have 
counted four checks over $15 million. 
They could be from four separate indi-
viduals, but it was happening so regu-
larly you would think you would prob-
ably go back to the same source. Some-
body spent, probably, $60 million to 
control who got on the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
We don’t know what business that $60 
million donor had before the Court, but 
it is not unusual for cases before the 
Court to have outcomes that will shift 
way more than $60 million. Just the 
climate change cases move hundreds of 
billions of dollars around in protecting 
fossil fuels’ enormous subsidy. So you 
have your 85 Fund and Concord Fund 
‘‘pierce the corporate veil with a ba-
nana’’ pair, and then you have their 
fictitious twins, the Judicial Education 
Project and the Judicial Crisis Net-
work, with big money flowing in. 
But it is not enough just to pack the 
Court. You also want to make sure 
that you are suppressing voters. Voter 
suppression is a very big deal, so you 
set up your Honest Elections Project to 
do voter suppression because, in this 
weird, billionaire-funded parallel uni-
verse, everything has the opposite 
name of what it is. Over here, you 
have, on the 501(c)(4) side, your Honest 
Elections Project Action because there 
you can spend some of the money po-
litically. So you have got a whole sepa-
rate set of twins—this time, com-
pletely 
fictitious 
twins, 
fictitious 
names—no different from the 85 Fund 
and the Concord Fund—designed to go 
out in the world and suppress voting: 
bring lawsuits, write challenge letters, 
argue for new laws. 
Then, as we saw in Virginia recently, 
you can really whip people up about 
what is going on in schools—critical 
race theory. So you set up your Free to 
Learn fictitious name with its little 
twin, Free to Learn Action, to do the 
501(c)(4) political work. So now what 
you have is a total of eight organiza-
tions that are really the same. 
Who does this? Who in real life does 
this, sets up eight organizations, six of 
which are mere fictitious names, to run 
the same money from the same donors 
out in the world to make it look as if

something real is happening, when, in 
fact, the whole thing is a phony front? 
And then you have, up at the head of 
the critter—you have how the people 
behind it get themselves paid. So you 
have advisers who advise these various 
entities. You have got the CRC Advi-
sors as the name of the group. It has its 
public relations antenna here, and it 
has its strategic advice antenna here, 
and the money flows usually this way 
so that the people who run this scheme 
for the big donors can take their cut. 
They get paid here. These are all for- 
profit. These are all the not-for-profits 
that are set up because they allow you 
to hide who your donors are. 
So that is the rig that was set up, 
and this is not the entirety of the front 
group scheme that was funded by the 
$580 million. This is just one coordi-
nated corporate critter that was set up 
in order to perform all of these dif-
ferent several functions. 
Think back to the Founding Fathers 
and their desire to set up a democracy 
where people made choices about their 
governments, where popular democracy 
would be the way in which society 
went forward. Do you think they had in 
mind something as creepy and complex 
as this? And do you think all that ef-
fort to build all this scheming, all the 
lawyers to file all the papers, to cook 
up all the funny, fictitious names to 
create all of these bogus organiza-
tions—what is the point of all that? 
Could there be a legitimate point to 
that? Why all the shells? Why all the 
hiding if you are not up to no good? 
Well, the bottom line is, they are up 
to no good. And the ‘‘no good’’ is to 
capture the U.S. Supreme Court and 
turn it from a proper Court into a cap-
tive political entity that will do what 
the people who are behind all this 
money tell it to do. 
And there are many ways they do it, 
and I will go into those many ways on 
other occasions. But on this one occa-
sion, I wanted just to focus on this 
multifaced 
corporate 
creature 
that 
hides its donors, that does all of this 
different work through fake, fictitious 
name organizations and through which 
money gets extracted by those who run 
it so they can pay themselves for this 
vast disservice to democracy. 
To be continued. 
I yield the floor.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
∑ Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, due to 
unforeseen circumstances I was unable 
to be present today for votes on amend-
ment No. 5186 and 5187 to S. 3373, the 
Honoring our PACT Act, and to the un-
derlying bill. I offer this statement in 
the RECORD in support of all three. 
Amendment No. 5186 to S. 3373, of-
fered by my good friend from Pennsyl-
vania, Mr. PAT TOOMEY, closes an im-
portant budgetary loophole by pre-
venting $390 billion in baseline discre-
tionary spending from being reclassi-
fied as mandatory spending under the 
legislation. I support this amendment, 
and I would encourage my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Amendment No. 5185 to S. 3373, of-
fered by my good friend from Ten-
nessee, 
Mrs. 
MARSHA
BLACKBURN, 
would expand care under the Veterans 
Community Care Program to include 
toxic-exposed veterans. This expanded 
care program is essential to ensure 
that toxic-exposed veterans receive the 
full range of support that they need. I 
would encourage my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this amendment. 
Finally, S. 3373, the Honoring our 
PACT Act, creates a presumption that 
veterans 
who 
suffer 
from 
certain 
health conditions, and who were ex-
posed to toxic substances as part of 
their military service, are eligible to 
receive 
Veterans 
Administration 
healthcare. This important bill will 
provide much-needed care to our vet-
erans, including lifesaving early detec-
tion and treatment of certain illnesses. 
I support the passage of the PACT 
Act.∑ 
f 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I am 
pleased that Democrats have come to-
gether to address the costs of prescrip-
tion drugs and to lower Affordable Care 
Act health care premiums for Ameri-
cans. I strongly support a negotiation 
process for prescription drugs that will 
enable the voices of affected stake-
holders, especially older adults, pa-
tients and people with disabilities, 
communities 
of 
color, 
and 
other 
marginalized groups, to play an inte-
gral role and inform the development 
and oversight of Medicare drug nego-
tiations. 
The 
Department 
of 
Health 
and 
Human Services has the authority to 
ensure affected stakeholders provide 
input about the potential for drugs to 
achieve outcomes that improve their 
quality of life. I view the Inflation Re-
duction Act as an opportunity to put 
older adults, people with disabilities 
and patients in front of the process so 
those affected, especially those histori-
cally excluded from the data used to 
make decisions, are at the table as the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services negotiates prices and ad-
vances the health equity goals we all 
share.

RECOGNIZING THE RECLAMATION 
OF WISCONSIN POINT FROM THE 
CITY 
OF 
SUPERIOR 
TO 
THE 
FOND DU LAC BAND OF LAKE 
SUPERIOR OJIBWE 
Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, 
today I rise to recognize the reclama-
tion of Wisconsin Point from the city 
of Superior to the Fond du Lac Band of 
Lake 
Superior 
Ojibwe. 
Wisconsin 
Point, a narrow strip of land sepa-
rating Allouez Bay from Lake Supe-
rior, is a small portion of the Tribe’s 
ancestral home and also an indigenous 
burial ground dating back 400 years. At 
least seven generations were laid to 
rest at the Wisconsin Point cemetery, 
including the Tribal community’s lead-
er Chief Joseph Osaugie. 
The Fond du Lac Band of Lake Supe-
rior—or 
Wayekwaa-gichigamiing 
Gichigamiwininiwag—Lake 
Superior 
Men at the far end of the Great Lake— 
is an Anishinaabe—Ojibwe—band lo-
cated near what is now known as Clo-
quet, MN. The Fond du Lac Band are 
one of six Tribes who comprise the fed-
erally recognized Minnesota Chippewa 
Tribe, which was organized in 1934 with 
a new constitution under the Indian 
Reorganization Act. 
In 1918, approximately 180 Ojibwe 
graves buried on Wisconsin Point were 
exhumed by the U.S. Steel Company 
and reburied in 29 plots south of the St. 
Francis Cemetery to make way for in-
dustrial development. Living Tribal 
members were also uprooted and re-
moved. 
Now, more than 100 years later, sig-
nificant work has been done by the city 
of Superior and Tribal leaders to ac-
knowledge the trauma of the lives and 
culture lost. 
On August 18, 2022, the Fond du Lac 
Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe and the 
city of Superior jointly host a celebra-
tion of the return of Wisconsin Point’s 
sacred burial ground, as well as the 
mass grave near St Francis cemetery 
to the Tribe. 
Please join me in celebrating this 
historic moment, where once again the 
Wisconsin Point lands return back to 
Lake Superior Ojibwe.

TRIBUTE TO KIM BRINKMAN 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
rise today to extend my congratula-
tions and best wishes to Kim Brinkman 
on the occasion of her retirement from 
the Senate disbursing office. For 34 
years, Kim has served this Chamber, 
its Members, and its staff with decency 
and grace. We are lucky and grateful 
that Kim—some three decades ago as a 
recent graduate from the University of 
Iowa—ventured to the library in Ames, 
IA, and answered an ad placed in a 
newspaper to travel to our Nation’s

Capital and begin work in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
Kim represents all that is great 
about public service—not just in aspi-
ration to serve our Nation, but in aspi-
ration to change it, too. When she first 
started at the disbursing office in Octo-
ber of 1987, there were just two female 
Senators. Today, there are 24, in addi-
tion to our first female Vice President. 
In the disbursing office itself, Kim was 
one of only 10 women on staff when she 
began her decades of service; she is now 
one of 45 women out of the office’s 58 
staff. 
The journey to Washington, DC, was 
a long one for Kim—geographically 
speaking. She comes from the town of 
Nevada, IA—the State where her par-
ents Harold and Jan Brinkman still re-
side. She has been sure to make the 
trek and visit home, bringing along her 
daughter, Maya Caceres, a recent grad-
uate of the University of Kentucky. An 
active member of her church and a fre-
quent volunteer, she has managed to 
lay deep roots here in our Nation’s 
Capital. 
Kim has been a kind, giving presence 
in the Senate for the past three dec-
ades. A compendium of Capitol knowl-
edge, we will surely miss her sage ad-
vice and dutiful support. While her de-
parture is a profound loss for this insti-
tution, Kim deserves a restful and ful-
filling retirement following her years 
of extraordinary service. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO AMY F. WOOLF 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to honor the achieve-
ments of Ms. Amy F. Woolf, a spe-
cialist in Nuclear Weapons Policy with 
the Congressional Research Service, on 
the occasion of her retirement. 
Amy Woolf served the Congress with 
distinction for more than 34 years. Be-
fore joining CRS, she was a member of 
the research staff at the Institute of 
Defense Analyses and spent a year at 
the Department of Defense, where she 
contributed to the 1994 Nuclear Posture 
Review. She earned a bachelor’s degree 
in political science from Stanford Uni-
versity and a master’s degree in public 
policy from the Kennedy School of 
Government at Harvard University. 
Ms. Woolf is recognized throughout 
Congress, the military, and the nuclear 
weapons and arms control communities 
as an expert on issues related to U.S. 
and Russian nuclear forces and arms 
control. She has authored countless 
CRS reports addressing issues such as 
nuclear weapons strategy and doctrine, 
nuclear force structure, strategic arms 
control and the U.S-Russian arms con-
trol agenda, hypersonic weapons, and 
threat reduction programs in Russia 
and other former Soviet states. 
A particular highlight of her tenure 
at CRS was her work supporting the 
Congressional 
debate 
on 
the 
New 
START treaty in 2010. Her unique 
knowledge of the issues positioned her 
as the go-to expert for members of Con-
gress and their staff with questions 
about the treaty. She analyzed treaty 
provisions, helped staffers navigate 
false and confusing claims about the 
treaty, and provided needed historical 
context. She also gave seminars on the 
procedural 
aspects 
of 
ratification. 
Throughout the time that Congress 
considered the treaty, Ms. Woolf was 
available to members of Congress and 
their staff 7 days a week and answered 
questions after hours. Her work for 
Congress on this treaty lasted from the 
start of negotiations in 2009 through 
submission to the Senate and ratifica-
tion in December 2010. 
In serving the CRS mission, Ms. 
Woolf helped members of Congress and 
their staff navigate complex nuclear 
weapons issues by narrowing in on 
their specific needs and succinctly pro-
viding them with accurate, balanced, 
and complete information. She has 
equally served opponents and sup-
porters of nuclear arms control trea-
ties. She answered questions about the 
future of the U.S. nuclear weapons ar-
senal from a variety of congressional 
offices with diverse viewpoints. Ms. 
Woolf participated in seminars for con-
gressional staff on a regular basis and 
could shift seamlessly from a 101-style 
overview of basic nuclear concepts for 
freshly minted Capitol Hill staffers to 
a lengthy in-depth briefing on U.S. nu-
clear posture and deterrence issues 
that would offer new insight to even 
the most seasoned policy advisor. Be-
cause of her three decades assisting 
Members of Congress and their staff, 
she demonstrated the keen ability to 
read her audience well and discern 
what information will be most useful 
to them. In an exceptional moment in 
2018, the chairman of the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee recognized 
her work from the dais after a hearing 
on Presidential authority over nuclear 
weapons. This followed a personal 
briefing for the chairman and prep 
work for the committee staff. 
Ms. Woolf also earned a reputation in 
CRS for her tireless work to educate 
new analysts, researchers, and congres-
sional staff. She is widely recognized in 
the policy community throughout the 
United States for her depth of knowl-
edge, her understanding of both nu-
clear weapons capabilities and arms 
control, and her ability to clearly ex-
press complex issues associated with 
both. Ms. Woolf has been an indispen-
sable asset to the U.S. Congress. I am 
proud to say she is also a Marylander. 
Amy Woolf’s deep well of knowledge 
and expertise will be sorely missed in 
the halls of Congress and throughout 
the nuclear policy community. Her col-
leagues and I join in wishing her all the 
best as she begins this next chapter in 
retirement.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DR. DOUG REISIG 
∑ Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
today I have the distinct honor of rec-
ognizing Dr. Doug Reisig of Missoula 
County as Montanan of the Month for 
his distinguished career as an educator 
and for his devotion to Montana stu-
dents, parents, and the community. 
Doug was born and raised in the 
great State of Montana. He earned his 
master’s degree from the University of 
Montana and his PhD from Montana 
State—‘‘Go Cats!’’ Doug taught at Bil-
lings West High School before accept-
ing a job at the St. Ignatius School 
District. It was in St. Ignatius that he 
met his lovely wife, Mary Jo. Doug and 
Mary Jo have been married for almost 
43 years and have raised two wonderful 
daughters, Megan and Callie. They are 
now the proud grandparents of four 
grandsons. 
Doug has been a teacher, building ad-
ministrator, and superintendent for 46 
years, serving as the superintendent at 
Hellgate Elementary for the past 34 
years. Prior to his retirement, he re-
ceived the G.V. Erickson Award from 
the School Administrators of Montana 
for his contribution to the betterment 
of education in our great State. 
Since Doug took over as super-
intendent, the school has seen a 33-per-
cent increase in enrollment. He also 
oversaw the construction of the new 
middle school. 
During the height of the COVID–19 
pandemic, under Doug’s leadership, 
Hellgate Elementary was a leader in 
delivering meals to children in need, 
and he went the extra mile by self-
lessly donating his increase in salary 
to the Family Resource Fund. With 
Doug’s direction and precautions in 
place, 
both 
Hellgate 
Elementary 
School and Middle School were in ses-
sion 5 days a week during the 2020 and 
2021 school years. 
It is my honor to recognize Dr. Doug 
Reisig for serving the State of Montana 
as an educator and for his dedication to 
ensuring Montana students have a 
bright future ahead. 
Congratulations on your retirement, 
Doug. You make Montana proud.∑

REMEMBERING RODRIGO ‘‘ROD’’ 
GARCIA 
∑ Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
rise to celebrate the life and mourn the 
passing of Rodrigo ‘‘Rod’’ Garcia, a 
man who dedicated his life to empow-
ering and advocating for the next gen-
eration of young Latino STEM stu-
dents and professionals. 
Born in 1943 in Los Angeles, CA, Rod 
learned early on the importance of 
higher education and public service. 
After graduating from the California 
State University in Los Angeles with a 
bachelor’s degree of science in engi-
neering, he worked for the city of Los 
Angeles as a civil engineer. 
As one of the few Hispanic engineers 
at the time, Rod saw the need to diver-
sify California’s booming tech and 
STEM fields. Beginning in 1973, he 
gathered fellow Hispanic engineers in 
his own garage to create fellowship and 
determine how to expand opportunities

for their community. In 1974, the Soci-
ety of Hispanic Professional Engineers, 
also known as SHPE, was officially 
founded 
and 
incorporated. 
As 
the 
founder, Rod had a vision to advance 
networking and education opportuni-
ties for other young Latino students 
and professionals in the engineering 
field. And almost 50 years later, the 
SHPE has grown to include over 13,000 
members and 286 chapters nationwide. 
Through Rod’s leadership and vision, 
SHPE has impacted the lives of thou-
sands of Latinos, including myself. 
I first met Rod as a young mechan-
ical engineering student at the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology. As a 
young Latino from Los Angeles, join-
ing SHPE gave me a sense of belonging. 
Rod always took the time to engage 
with students, hear their unique sto-
ries, and encourage them to complete a 
STEM degree. Rod dedicated his life to 
ensuring that fellow Latinos had op-
portunities and understood the value of 
a STEM degree in the real world. 
Rod left behind an incredible legacy 
that will continue to live on. He will be 
remembered for his devotion and advo-
cacy and for his ability to empower the 
Latino community. I am eternally 
grateful for Rod’s impact on my own 
life. The American dream endures be-
cause of leaders like Rod Garcia, who 
don’t shut the door to opportunity as 
they walk through it, but who open it 
wider for those who come next. 
My wife Angela and I send our deep-
est condolences and prayers to his wife 
Cynthia Cathy Wong, his children Mar-
lene Tomasina Zamora, Marianne Pilar 
Garcia, and Rodrick Fitzgerald Garcia, 
and the rest of his family and friends.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Ms. WARREN, and Mr. WYDEN): 
S. 4727. A bill establish a grant pro-
gram to incentivize the energy resil-
ience of air carrier airports to acquire 
or install solar photovoltaic panels, 
battery storage systems, microgrids, 
and related electric infrastructure for 
on-site renewable energy generation 
and storage, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Airport En-
ergy Resiliency and Renewable Energy 
Act, which I introduced today. 
While some airports are already 
using renewable energy systems to en-
hance the energy efficiency of their 
power sources, our Nation’s airports 
still have incredible opportunities to 
lower emissions and improve energy re-
siliency by further investing in renew-
able energy sources and energy storage 
solutions. 
For example, commercial solar pan-
els are bigger and more efficient than 
residential ones and can generate sub-
stantially more power without pre-
senting a threat to aviation operations. 
Furthermore, battery storage and 
microgrids would allow energy to be 
stored and used later during peak de-
mand, when it is most needed. In the 
event of a power disruption or outage 
as a result of a natural disaster or 
other emergency, deploying solar gen-
eration coupled with battery storage 
would allow airports to power essential 
facilities using renewable resources in-
stead of generators, which often run on 
fossil fuels.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3864 
August 2, 2022 
In concert with the resources being 
delivered by the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture law, providing new dedicated fund-
ing would help kickstart existing inter-
est in reducing carbon footprint and 
improving the energy resiliency at air-
ports. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this bill to create a new FAA grant 
program to help airports invest in re-
newable generation resources such as 
solar panels, battery storage systems, 
and microgrids. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill to unlock the op-
portunity to leverage our Nation’s air-
ports to modernize our electric grid 
and implement clean energy tech-
nologies. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. BOOKER, Mr. WYDEN, Ms. 
DUCKWORTH, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. 
PADILLA, and Ms. WARREN): 
S. 4740. A bill to amend the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the 
Animal Welfare Act to prohibit the 
taking, importation, exportation, and 
breeding of certain cetaceans for public 
display, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of legislation 
that I introduced today along with 
Senators BOOKER, WYDEN, DUCKWORTH, 
PADILLA, and WARREN: the Strength-
ening 
Welfare 
in 
Marine 
Settings 
(SWIMS) Act. This is a companion to 
legislation introduced by Congressman 
ADAM
SCHIFF
in the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Our bill would ban the importation 
and 
exportation 
of 
orcas, 
beluga 
whales, pilot whales, and false killer 
whales for public display, with an ex-
ception for animals being released to a 
marine sanctuary or back to the wild. 
Our bill would also prohibit breeding 
captive whales to raise their newborns 
for public display, ensuring that the 
current generation of these whales in 
captivity would be the last. 
The evidence is clear: Orcas, beluga 
whales, pilot whales, and false killer 
whales are intelligent and emotionally 
complex animals that cannot thrive in 
captivity. In the wild, these whales can 
travel up to 100 miles per day and dive 
hundreds of feet deep. 
However, many animals in captivity 
live in tanks so small they cannot even 
turn around. Often, these whales are so 
stressed that they gnaw on the con-
crete walls of their tanks until the den-
tal nerves of their teeth are exposed, 
permanently damaging their teeth and 
requiring constant antibiotics. 
The inhumane confinement for these 
animals has consequences, which are 
made clear when news breaks of yet an-
other whale dying well before its time. 
In the wild, the average orca lives for 
40 years. Orcas in captivity in the 
United States typically live only 12 
years. Although no orca has ever been 
documented attacking a human in the 
wild, in captivity, these whales have 
been documented to lash out at their 
human trainers, causing severe harm 
or death. 
Despite these well-established facts, 
more than 50 whales remain in cap-
tivity across the United States. My 
home State of California has already 
banned orca shows and breeding, and 
some exhibitors like SeaWorld have 
promised to end their orca breeding 
programs. 
It is long past time for Federal Gov-
ernment to apply this policy to the 
whale species that suffer the most in 
captivity and end this cruel practice. 
Our bill, which is endorsed by 15 ani-
mal welfare organizations, would do 
just that. 
Mr. President, by passing my bill, the 
Senate can prevent the needless suf-
fering and deaths of these majestic ani-
mals who truly belong in the wild. I 
urge my colleagues to join us in co-
sponsoring the SWIMS Act. 
By Mr. BOOKER: 
S. 4749. A bill to improve grants ad-
ministered by the Office of Community 
Oriented Policing Services, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, when 
the Federal Government authorizes bil-
lions of dollars in grants to States, we 
have a duty to ensure that those dol-
lars are spent in a responsible, effec-
tive manner. Accountability is essen-
tial to a healthy, functioning democ-
racy. 
And it is especially important when 
we discuss issues related to policing. In 
recent years, we have seen egregious 
instances of police misconduct, many 
of which have involved the unjustifi-
able deaths of Black people. Right now, 
it is vital that we prioritize initiatives 
that will improve public safety and 
strengthen public trust in law enforce-
ment. 
As mayor of Newark, I spent hun-
dreds of hours with police officers 
riding along with them in their squad 
cars and learning about the daily chal-
lenges they face trying to make our 
communities safer. I have seen their 
bravery in the face of uncertainty and 
their fear knowing that their streets 
are filling up with deadly weapons of 
war. I have witnessed the enormous 
sacrifices they make in service of the 
public. 
I have tremendous respect for our 
law enforcement officers. and I believe 
that they need support to be able to do 
their jobs effectively. I support improv-
ing officer training programs, hiring 
more officers in underresourced depart-
ments, and updating the outdated 
equipment law enforcement agencies 
are often left using. 
Any resources provided, however, 
must be coupled with transparency. It 
flies in the face of responsible govern-
ance to invest significant resources 
into something without ever knowing 
what parts of that investment are pay-
ing dividends. 
Transparency does not mean that 
every law enforcement program must 
come under the Federal Government’s 
close scrutiny. Instead, it means com-
monsense data collection and report-
ing. It means tracking how Federal 
funds are spent and whether they 
produce positive or negative outcomes. 
It means doing basic due diligence 
for the purpose of improving policing 
in this country and ensuring that tax-
payer dollars are being spent as effec-
tively as possible. 
As Congress moves to increase Fed-
eral assistance to State and local law 
enforcement agencies, we must ensure 
responsible administration and over-
sight of grant programs and ensure re-
sources are directed toward policing 
practices that actually enhance public 
safety and promote the dignity of all 
communities, 
especially 
Black 
and 
Brown communities. 
One of the biggest pools of funding 
for 
our 
Nation’s 
law 
enforcement 
comes in the form of grants from the 
Community Oriented Policing Serv-
ices, COPS, Office. The amount of 
money given to State and local law en-
forcement through these grants has 
steadily increased over the last few 
years, from $222 million for fiscal year 
2017 to $512 million for fiscal year 2022. 
These grants fund the improvement 
of Tribal law enforcement agencies, 
school violence prevention, drug crime 
enforcement aria prevention, mental 
health and wellness services, equip-
ment and technological capabilities, 
and community policing strategies. 
All of these programs share the goal 
of improving public safety. Yet, despite 
the large increase in funding for the 
COPS grant program, Congress has not 
moved to measure the successes and 
failures of the program. As such, we 
cannot be sure that real improvements 
are actually being made with the more 
than half a billion dollars in taxpayer 
money being spent. 
Reviewing how COPS grants are 
being spent and the outcomes they are 
producing will help realize the very 
goals that the COPS program aims to 
advance. 
Ensuring that the Federal Govern-
ment, through COPS grants, invests in 
best practices will help train officers in 
the most effective ways possible. Es-
tablishing 
performance 
metrics 
for 
COPS grants will allow law enforce-
ment agencies to identify which initia-
tives make officers and the public safer 
and which reduce negative and dan-
gerous interactions between law en-
forcement and the public. 
As law enforcement agencies are 
called upon to bolster their data collec-
tion and reporting practices, it is also 
important to recognize that some agen-
cies, particularly in underresourced 
communities, struggle to respond to 
those calls even with the availability 
of COPS grants. We must specifically 
dedicate more resources toward help-
ing these law enforcement agencies 
meet these standards. 
In particular, many law enforcement 
agencies have not been fully equipped 
to report data to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation’s National Use-of-Force 
Data Collection. This dearth of data se-
verely hinders our ability to analyze 
policing trends, develop best practices, 
and 
hold 
officers 
accountable 
for 
wrongdoing when it occurs. 
These measures for transparency and 
accountability are basic, commonsense 
ways to invest effectively in policing 
and make our communities safer. All 
law enforcement agencies should be 
collecting and reporting data. All law 
enforcement agencies should be com-
plying with civil rights laws. All law 
enforcement agencies should be using 
performance metrics to identify best 
practices. 
These 
are 
the 
building 
blocks of responsible, modern policing 
which we should all be able to agree on. 
Today, I introduced the COPS Re-
sponsible Administration and Manage-
ment Act of 2022, which will promote 
the kind of accountability and trans-
parency that should accompany these 
important investments that the Fed-
eral Government makes in law enforce-
ment. 
This bill supports and complements 
the crucial investments we are making 
in police forces by reviewing COPS 
grants to ensure they are being effec-
tively and efficiently administered, 
evaluating how COPS grants are being 
utilized and how well they are assisting 
law enforcement in making commu-
nities safer, offering grants to agencies 
to improve data reporting, and assess-
ing agency compliance with civil rights 
laws. 
This Congress has made historic in-
vestments in improving law enforce-
ment and addressing violent crime in 
our communities. Let us also take the 
time to make sure that those invest-
ments are paying off. 
Law enforcement agencies across the 
country are struggling to manage com-
peting demands. Officers work incred-
ibly hard every day to protect their 
neighborhoods, and they often do so 
without the equipment, personnel, and 
training that they need. 
The good news is that law enforce-
ment agencies will be receiving many 
of these important resources with 
COPS grant funding. At the same time, 
if the goal of this funding is to improve 
policing and public safety, which we 
can all agree it is, then we must also 
track and evaluate the success of these 
grants. 
Our investments should produce posi-
tive outcomes for communities. They 
should reduce negative and dangerous 
interactions between officers and the 
public, including use-of-force incidents, 
and they should increase the public’s 
trust in law enforcement. 
Our officers deserve resources that 
will help them do their jobs effectively 
and keep them safe. Our communities 
deserve police forces that are well- 
trained and well-informed. The COPS 
Administration Act will help secure 
both of those goals. 
SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
734—SUP-
PORTING 
THE 
GOALS 
AND 
IDEALS OF A NATIONAL MOVE 
OVER LAW DAY 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself and 
Mr. BRAUN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation: 
S. RES. 734 
Whereas the Senate wishes to recognize 
traffic incident management responders (as 
described in the Traffic Incident Manage-
ment Handbook of the Federal Highway Ad-
ministration), which include law enforce-
ment, fire and rescue, emergency medical 
services, tow truck operators, and transpor-
tation workers; 
Whereas, due to the increasingly high rate 
of distracted drivers on the roadway, many 
traffic incident management responders lose 
their lives while performing their duties 
each year; 
Whereas, in 2021, 65 traffic incident man-
agement responders were killed in the 
United States due to roadside collisions; 
Whereas the Federal Highway Administra-
tion and the National Highway Traffic Safe-
ty Administration of the Department of 
Transportation host the Crash Responder 
Safety Week annually in November as a na-
tional effort to— 
(1) protect traffic incident management re-
sponders who are at the scene of highway 
crashes; and 
(2) remind the public of their responsibility 
to use caution when driving near roadside in-
cidents involving traffic incident manage-
ment responders; 
Whereas each State has a move over law, 
which has correlated directly with a safer 
environment along the roadsides of the 
United States for traffic incident manage-
ment responders and stranded citizens; 
Whereas move over laws generally require 
motorists to move at least 1 lane over when 
there is an emergency or rescue activity tak-
ing place on the shoulder or side of the road-
way, or, if unable to do so safely, to slow 
down and pass the scene with caution; 
Whereas the Government Accountability 
Office report entitled ‘‘Emergency Responder 
Safety: States and DOT Are Implementing 
Actions to Reduce Roadside Crashes’’ (GAO– 
21–166) noted that State officials cite raising 
public awareness as the most prevalent chal-
lenge to move over laws; and 
Whereas providing traffic incident manage-
ment responders an enhanced opportunity to 
inform the motoring public about these laws 
is critical to the public safety: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of a Na-
tional Move Over Law Day; and 
(2) urges the national, State, and regional 
incident management organizations— 
(A) to spread awareness and promote the 
existence of, and adherence to, State move 
over laws; and 
(B) to educate the public further on the 
dangers and loss of life that occur if State 
move over laws are not faithfully observed.

mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on 
Armed Services: 
S. RES. 735 
Whereas 
Congresswoman 
Edith 
Nourse 
Rogers of Massachusetts introduced a bill, 
H.R. 6293 (77th Congress), to create the Wom-
en’s Army Auxiliary Corps (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘WAAC’’) to expand the 
types of jobs women could hold in the Army 
to address manpower shortages; 
Whereas President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
established the WAAC by signing the Act en-
titled ‘‘An Act to establish a Women’s Army 
Auxiliary Corps for service with the Army of 
the United States’’, approved May 14, 1942 
(commonly known as the ‘‘W.A.A.C. (Wom-
en’s Army Auxiliary Corps) Act’’) (Public 
Law 77–554; 56 Stat. 278) into law; 
Whereas while 35,000 women had served in 
the enlisted ranks of the Army primarily in 
nursing positions during World War I, women 
had little formal means to serve in non-med-
ical roles prior to the creation of the WAAC; 
Whereas despite widely held stigmas asso-
ciated with women in the military and nu-
merous false allegations of impropriety 
among members of the WAAC, women ap-
plied to serve in such high numbers that en-
rollment ceilings were reached within the 
first year; 
Whereas under the leadership of Colonel 
Oveta Culp Hobby, service in the WAAC 
quickly exceeded the 25,000 women initially 
expected; 
Whereas Secretary of War Henry Stimson 
had to raise the limit on WAAC recruitment 
to 150,000 women because of high levels of en-
rollment; 
Whereas the WAAC worked across the 
country, from Washington to Tennessee and 
from New Mexico to South Carolina, as well 
as overseas; 
Whereas members of the WAAC served in 
numerous capacities, including as switch-
board operators, mechanics, bakers, drivers, 
cryptographers, lab technicians, and nurses; 
Whereas members of the WAAC, despite 
the quality and value of their contributions 
to the war effort, were not given benefits or 
pay equal to those of their male counter-
parts, and were not recognized as full mem-
bers of the Army; 
Whereas President Roosevelt signed the 
Act entitled ‘‘An Act to establish a Women’s 
Army Corps for service in the Army of the 
United States’’, approved July 1, 1943 (com-
monly known as the ‘‘W.A.C. (Women’s 
Army Corps) Act’’) (Public Law 78–110; 57 
Stat. 371), into law, which converted the 
WAAC into the Women’s Army Corp (re-
ferred to in this preamble as the ‘‘WAC’’), 
gave the women official military status and 
the same ranks and privileges of their male 
counterparts, and allowed the women to 
serve overseas; 
Whereas during World War II, members of 
the WAC served overseas as drivers, clerks, 
nurses, and mechanics, enabling the release 
of more than 7 divisions of men to serve in 
combat roles;

and discipline; 
Whereas General and future President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower said that the WAC’s 
‘‘contributions in efficiency, skill, spirit, and 
determination are immeasurable’’; 
Whereas the WAC served as an important 
precursor to the complete gender integration 
of the military in 1978; and 
Whereas the brave women who served in 
the WAAC and the WAC are owed a great 
debt of gratitude for their service to the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the women who served the 
United States in the Women’s Auxiliary 
Army Corp (referred to in this resolution as 
the ‘‘WAAC’’) and the Women’s Army Corp 
(referred to in this resolution as the ‘‘WAC’’) 
during World War II;

the WAC who, through their dedication to 
the United States and perseverance through 
significant social pressure, served in critical 
military positions to aid the war effort, free-
ing male soldiers for combat duty; and 
(3) recognizes that the WAAC and the WAC 
overcame stereotypes to open up more oppor-

RESOLUTION 
736—CALL-
ING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF 
ANGOLA TO HOLD FREE, FAIR, 
AND PEACEFUL ELECTIONS ON 
AUGUST 24, 2022, AND FOR OTHER 
PURPOSES 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
CARDIN, and Mr. VAN
HOLLEN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 736 
Whereas the Republic of Angola will hold a 
general election to elect its President and 
National Assembly on August 24, 2022; 
Whereas this year’s election will be Ango-
la’s fifth multiparty election since 1992; 
Whereas Angola’s 2 main political parties, 
the People’s Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola (MPLA) and the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), 
were the principal belligerents in the coun-
try’s 26-year civil war; 
Whereas Angola experienced its first presi-
dential electoral transition in 2017, when 
President Joao Lourenco of the MPLA suc-
ceeded Jose Eduardo dos Santos, also of the 
MPLA, who ruled Angola for 38 years; 
Whereas, despite holding regular elections 
and having active political opposition par-
ties, Angola is classified as ‘‘Not Free’’ by 
Freedom House due to the ruling MPLA’s 
abuse of state institutions to control polit-
ical processes and limit free expression; 
Whereas mass media in Angola is con-
trolled or highly influenced by the state, 
independent journalists face harassment, op-
position parties are subject to bureaucratic 
interference, and fewer than half of Angolans 
feel free to speak their mind, according to a 
2019 poll by Afrobarometer; 
Whereas Angola is in a period of economic 
and social crisis, with widespread frustration 
over the poor state of the oil-based economy 
and persistently high rates of poverty, in-
equality, and public corruption; 
Whereas, since 2020, Angolans have ex-
pressed their dissatisfaction through fre-
quent public protests, which have been met 
with arrests and police violence against pro-
testers; and 
Whereas the failure to hold a credible elec-
tion will dangerously exacerbate political 
tensions in Angola: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) calls on the Government of Angola to 
hold free, fair, and peaceful elections on Au-
gust 24, 2022; 
(2) urges the Government of Angola to en-
sure the credibility of elections by— 
(A) allowing for all parties and candidates 
to campaign without undue restriction, har-
assment, or intimidation; 
(B) publishing and freely disseminating 
electoral information, including voter rolls 
and election results; 
(C) permitting the unrestricted participa-
tion of independent election monitors, in-
cluding by inviting the European Union to 
send an election observation mission, as the 
European Union has stated it is prepared to 
do; 
(D) ceasing the use of state resources and 
institutions to support or promote particular 
political parties or candidates; and 
(E) reversing the ban on opinion polling 
during elections; 
(3) urges all political parties in Angola to 
pledge that they will not use violence during 
or after the election, will respect the out-
come of the vote, and will investigate any 
disputes peacefully, using legal mechanisms; 
(4) urges the people of Angola to exercise 
their right to vote on election day; 
(5) calls on all parties to work together, 
whatever the outcome of the election, to de-
velop and implement a broad-based reform 
agenda, undertaken in collaboration with 
civil society, that will address the most ur-
gent issues facing Angola, including by pur-
suing policies that— 
(A) reduce inequality and poverty includ-
ing by increasing employment opportunities, 
especially for youth, women, and other 
marginalized groups; 
(B) diversify the economy, privatize state- 
owned enterprises in a fair and transparent 
manner, attract foreign investment, improve 
public financial management and oversight, 
and protect labor and property rights; 
(C) seek to eliminate public corruption at 
all levels, including by prosecuting corrupt 
actors without exception; and 
(D) enhance and improve civil liberties, 
human rights, and free expression for all An-
golans; 
(6) calls on the United States Government 
to hold Angolan officials accountable for any 
attempts to subvert the electoral process; 
and 
(7) stands with the people of Angola and 
supports their aspirations for a free, demo-
cratic election.

AUGUST 
10, 
2022, 
AS 
‘‘TOXIC EXPOSURE AWARENESS 
DAY’’ 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. 
ROUNDS) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 737 
Whereas, during the Vietnam War, the 
United States sprayed between 11,000,000 and 
12,000,000 gallons of Agent Orange, poten-
tially exposing millions of members of the 
Armed Forces stationed in Vietnam and else-
where to this toxic mixture of herbicides; 
Whereas, after the Vietnam War, it took 
the United States Government years to rec-
ognize the link between Agent Orange and 
the health conditions being experienced by 
thousands of returning members of the 
Armed Forces; 
Whereas the Agent Orange Act of 1991 
(Public Law 102–4; 38 U.S.C. 1116 note), pro-
vided Vietnam veterans with a presumption 
of service connection for diseases associated 
with exposure to certain herbicide agents; 
Whereas members of the Armed Forces 
have been exposed to toxic substances while 
serving at home, including at Camp Lejeune, 
where as many as 1,000,000 members of the 
Armed Forces, family members, and staff 
may have been exposed to drinking water 
containing contaminants that have been 
linked to adverse health effects; 
Whereas members of the Armed Forces 
have been exposed to toxic radiation while 
engaged in cleanup operations, including 
in— 
(1) the Republic of the Marshall Islands; 
(2) Thule, Greenland; and 
(3) Palomares, Spain. 
Whereas, from 1985 to 2001, at Naval Air 
Facility Atsugi in Atsugi, Japan, personnel 
and family members of members of the 
Armed Forces, including dependent children, 
may have been exposed to environmental 
contaminants from off-base waste inciner-
ators. 
Whereas the Armed Forces used burn pits 
in Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United 
Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain 
during Operation Desert Shield and Oper-
ation Desert Storm; 
Whereas more than 250 burn pits were used 
during military operations in Iraq, Afghani-
stan, and Djibouti after September 11, 2001; 
Whereas veterans encountered hazardous 
exposures while serving at the Karshi- 
Khanabad Air Base, commonly known as K2, 
in Uzbekistan from 2001 to 2005; 
Whereas there were no regulations re-
stricting what the Armed Forces could burn 
in burn pits until 2009; 
Whereas the open air burn pits used by the 
Armed Forces in many overseas operations 
may have exposed members of the Armed 
Forces to a variety of potentially harmful 
substances; 
Whereas the Department of Defense esti-
mates that approximately 3,500,000 members 
of the Armed Forces, who served in the 
Southwest Asia theater of military oper-
ations after August 2, 1990, or in Afghanistan 
after September 11, 2001, may have been ex-
posed to airborne hazards; 
Whereas an Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans 
of America survey found that 86 percent of 
post-9/11 veterans who served in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan say they were exposed to burn pits 
or airborne toxic materials; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of members 
of the Armed Forces and other personnel 
who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, 
Saudi Araibia, Djibouti, Qatar, Bahrain, 
Oman, United Arab Emirates, and certain 
sea locations have signed up for a burn pit 
registry created in 2014 by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs for veterans to register 
health problems associated with exposure to 
burn pits; and 
Whereas designating August 10, 2022, as 
‘‘Toxic Exposure Awareness Day’’ would be 
an appropriate way to honor the members of 
the Armed Forces who were exposed to toxic 
substances while serving in defense of the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates August 10, 2022, as ‘‘Toxic 
Exposure Awareness Day’’; 
(2) honors and recognizes the contributions 
of the members of the Armed Forces and vet-
erans who were exposed to toxic substances; 
(3) encourages States and local govern-
ments to designate August 10, 2022, as ‘‘Toxic 
Exposure Awareness Day’’; 
(4) encourages the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (referred to in this resolution as 
‘‘VA’’) to conduct additional outreach and 
promote awareness of the resources that the

CONSUMER 
SAFETY, BY DESIGNATING THE 
MONTH 
OF 
AUGUST 
AS 
‘‘NA-
TIONAL 
ANTI-COUNTERFEITING 
AND CONSUMER EDUCATION AND 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. 
COONS, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. TILLIS, and Mr. 
WARNOCK) submitted the following res-
olution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 738 
Whereas public awareness is crucial to 
safeguard consumers and businesses from un-
safe and unreliable products that, through il-
licit activity, threaten intellectual property 
rights, the economic market, and even the 
health and well-being of consumers; 
Whereas Federal statutes such as the Act 
of July 5, 1946 (commonly referred to as the 
‘‘Trademark Act of 1946’’ or the ‘‘Lanham 
Act’’) (60 Stat. 427, chapter 540; 15 U.S.C. 1051 
et seq.) (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘Lanham Act’’) and the Trademark Counter-
feiting Act of 1984 (Public Law 98–473; 98 
Stat. 2178) regulate the unlawful act of pro-
ducing and selling counterfeit products; 
Whereas the Lanham Act provided the 
foundation for modern Federal trademark 
protection, creating legal rights and rem-
edies for brand owners suffering from trade-
mark infringement, helping consumers make 
informed choices by reducing the amount of 
confusingly similar products, and making 
the marketplace more fair, competitive, and 
safe for all; 
Whereas, according to the World Intellec-
tual Property Organization, there was an es-
timated 64,400,000 active trademark registra-
tions around the world in 2020, an 11.2 per-
cent increase from the previous year; 
Whereas counterfeit products undermine 
laws, including the Lanham Act, that ensure 
the safety of consumers, businesses, and 
brand owners against illegitimate products 
in the marketplace, from which criminal 
groups and bad actors are benefitting at the 
expense of the public and private sector; 
Whereas counterfeiters use different online 
platforms to attract consumers to buy ille-
gitimate goods, usually enticing consumers 
through cheaper prices; 
Whereas the growth of both global com-
merce and electronic commerce has expe-
dited the evolving problem because it has 
given third-party actors an enhanced oppor-
tunity to reach consumers that they may 
have not previously been able to reach; 
Whereas the deceptive tactics of counter-
feiters and their counterfeit products pose 
actual and potential harm to the health and 
safety of United States citizens, especially 
the most vulnerable consumers in society, 
such as senior citizens and children; 
Whereas, according to the 2021 Special 301 
Report issued by the Office the United States 
Trade 
Representative, 
counterfeit 
items 
often do not comply with regulated safety 
standards, and as a result, vast amounts of 
unsafe products are constantly circulating 
the market; 
Whereas goods originating in China and 
Hong Kong account for approximately 80 per-
cent of all global customs seizures of dan-
gerous counterfeit goods, including food-
stuffs, 
pharmaceuticals, 
cosmetics, 
and 
other goods; 
Whereas 
many 
international 
criminals 
have used the pandemic to exploit the mar-
ket with numerous counterfeits, and as a re-
sult, have defrauded United States citizens; 
Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion has stressed the need to educate the 
healthcare industry, private organizations, 
and the public of the United States on the 
increased potential for counterfeit medical 
equipment that is used in relation to the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas counterfeit medical products pose 
a particular threat to the safety and health 
of consumers in the United States because 
the counterfeit product does not provide the 
same level of protection as an authentic arti-
cle; 
Whereas these dangers were elevated dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic by significant 
trafficking in counterfeit personal protective 
equipment, medical devices, and COVID–19 
treatments; 
Whereas, according to the World Trade-
mark review, ‘‘as of 25 March 2021, there 
have been 2,054 covid-19-related seizures, in-
cluding counterfeit masks and medicines to-
taling in excess of $47.2 million, with 265 ar-
rests’’; 
Whereas, in September 2021, the Drug En-
forcement Administration (‘‘DEA’’) issued 
its first Public Safety Alert in 6 years to 
warn the public about the alarming increase 
in the availability and lethality of fake pre-
scription pills in the United States, pills 
that often contain deadly doses of fentanyl, 
and in 2021 the DEA seized a staggering 
20,400,000 fake prescription pills; 
Whereas counterfeit products threaten the 
United States economy and job creation, and 
according to United States Customs and Bor-
der Protection, counterfeiting and piracy 
cost businesses in the United States more 
than $200,000,000,000 per year and has led to 
the loss of 750,000 jobs; 
Whereas, in 2021, the United States Cus-
toms and Border Protection reported 20,252 
counterfeit good seizures, with ‘‘an esti-
mated manufacturer’s suggested retail price 
(MSRP) of over $2.15 billion if the goods were 
authentic [, which] equates to about $5.88 
million in counterfeit goods seizures every 
day’’; 
Whereas the manufacturing, trade, and 
consumption of counterfeit products are on 
the rise; 
Whereas, according to the United States 
Patent and Trademark Office, as of 2020, at 
least 20 percent of counterfeit and pirated 
goods sold abroad displace sales in the 
United States, and of the $143,000,000,000 sold 
of such goods, the United States economy 
suffers a loss of around $29,000,000,000 per 
year; 
Whereas businesses of all sizes collectively 
spend millions of dollars to protect and en-
force their own brand and products by re-
moving counterfeit products from both on-
line and physical marketplaces; 
Whereas businesses must devote resources 
to combating counterfeit products instead of 
using those resources to grow their business 
by hiring new employees and developing new 
products; 
Whereas 1 of the most effective ways to 
protect consumers of the dangers of counter-
feit products is through educational cam-
paigns and awareness programs; and 
Whereas organizations such as the Con-
gressional Trademark Caucus, Federal en-
forcement agencies, the National Intellec-
tual Property Rights Coordination Center, 
and State enforcement agencies are actively 
working to raise awareness of the value of 
trademarks and the impact and harms 
caused by counterfeit products on both the 
national and State economies: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the month of August 2022 as 
‘‘National Anti-Counterfeiting and Consumer 
Education and Awareness Month’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Anti-Counterfeiting and Consumer 
Education and Awareness Month to educate 
the public and raise public awareness about 
the actual and potential dangers counterfeit 
products pose to consumer health and safety; 
(3) affirms the continuing importance and 
need for comprehensive Federal, State, and

sector-supported 
education 
and 
awareness efforts designed to equip the con-
sumers of the United States with the infor-
mation and tools needed to safeguard against 
illegal counterfeit products in traditional 
commerce, internet commerce, and other 
electronic commerce platforms; and 
(4) recognizes and reaffirms the commit-
ment of the United States to combating 
counterfeiting 
by 
promoting 
awareness 
about the actual and potential harm of coun-
terfeiting to consumers and brand owners 
and by promoting new education programs 
and campaigns designed to reduce the supply 
of, and demand for, counterfeit products.

f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor this evening to talk 
about the Democrats’ latest reconcili-
ation proposal. This is the tax-and- 
spend legislation you have probably 
heard about. It is called the Inflation 
Reduction Act, but don’t be fooled by 
the name. It doesn’t actually decrease 
the inflationary pressure we all feel at 
the gas pump, at the grocery store, 
clothes shopping. It actually makes it 
worse. 
Sadly, we have been down this road 
before. Early last year, the Democrats 
passed a massive $1.9 trillion package 
that was supposedly focused on COVID, 
but most of it had nothing to with 
COVID but provided a lot of stimulus. 
It was the largest spending package 
ever in the history of Congress, and, at 
the time it passed, a lot of us said: 
Wow, the economy coming out of that 
first stage of COVID is already picking 
up steam. 
In fact, the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office was telling us 
that, by midyear last year, we would be 
back to where we were prepandemic— 
pretty strong economic growth—and 
yet the Democrats were insisting on 
another $1.9 trillion, almost $2 trillion, 
of spending. 
Remember, we had just passed a $900 
billion spending bill to help with 
COVID, which was bipartisan, by the 
way. I was part of putting that to-
gether. And so when it came to this 
new one, we said: Whoa, don’t do this. 
It is going to overheat the economy, 
overstimulate the economy—particu-
larly because inflation is about demand 
mismatching supply. 
And this is exactly what was hap-
pening. You had demand growing and 
supply constricted, partly because of 
COVID, partly because of policy deci-
sions that were being made. 
So we warned that this much stim-
ulus in the economy was going to lead 
to inflation, and very sadly, we were 
right. 
By the way, it wasn’t just Repub-
licans who said that. Some prominent 
Democrat officials said that, including 
some who had been senior economic ad-
visers in the Obama administration, in 
the Clinton administration, including 
Larry Summers, who was quite pre-
scient when he said: Gosh, we shouldn’t 
do this because this is going to heat up 
the economy and cause a lot of infla-
tion. 
Democrats didn’t pay any attention 
to those concerns then. They went 
ahead and passed that legislation. Re-
member, today, we are looking at in-
flation that is the highest it has been 
in 40 years, and here we are today 
about to do some of the same exact 
things: more spending, more taxes. 
It is $700 billion more in spending and 
about $326 billion in taxes—new taxes 
on the economy. 
It will not reduce inflation. In fact, 
the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget 
Model predicts it will actually increase 
inflation over the next 2 years and 
that, over time, it will be about even. 
But it won’t decrease inflation. In fact, 
over the first couple of years, they say 
it will increase it. 
And the burden of the $326 billion in 
the tax increases is not just going to 
companies. It never does. It gets passed 
along. In this case, it falls, of course, 
to workers and to consumers. Accord-
ing to the nonpartisan Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation that we have to 
rely on up here—it is a nonpartisan 
group that gives us the analyses of 
these tax bills—it will hurt Americans 
in nearly every income bracket. 
In fact, they say more than half of 
the $300 million in new taxes will fall 
on folks making less than $400,000 a 
year. Why? Because, again, you are 
taxing a company, but the company 
passes that along to its workers and to 
its customers. And they are saying 
that more than half of that burden will 
fall on taxpayers who make less than 
$400,000 a year. 
Why do I say that? Because that is 
the cutoff that President Biden has al-
ways put in place, saying that no tax 
increases will affect anybody who 
makes less than 400,000 bucks a year. 
This one does. Again, it is based on the 
Joint Committee on Taxation. 
As part of these tax hikes, manufac-
turing is hit particularly hard. The 
Joint Committee says that about 50 
percent of the impact of this tax in-
crease is going to be on manufacturing 
businesses. 
Now, this is interesting to me be-
cause we just passed a big bill. Some 
call it the CHIPS bill. Some call it the 
China bill. Some call it the Competi-
tion bill. But it was a bill to focus on 
what? Making our American companies 
more 
competitive, 
particularly 
our 
manufacturing companies. And we are 
spending a lot of money—hundreds of 
billions of dollars—to do that. And here 
we are turning around and saying: No. 
Do you know what? We are actually 
going to increase taxes on these manu-
facturing businesses. 
This proposed tax is very different 
from the existing corporate income 
tax, which is based on income that 
these businesses actually report to the 
Internal Revenue Service when they 
file their taxes. That income has been 
defined by Congress over the years. It 
doesn’t use that as the measure of in-
come. Instead, it looks at a company’s 
financial statements and comes up 
with a new definition of income called 
the adjusted financial statement in-
come. 
This type of financial reporting is far 
broader because these statements were 
designed for very different reasons. 
Taxable income that the IRS is in 
charge of, as opposed to financial in-
come, is meant to raise revenue and 
provides in our Tax Code all kinds of 
tax preferences, incentives, disincen-
tives for certain activity—like being 
able to deduct the cost of new equip-
ment. That is something we want to 
encourage. So we allow companies to 
do that. Like being able to take a tax 
credit, let’s say, for energy efficiency— 
we want to encourage companies to do 
that. So that is in the tax part as op-
posed to the book income part. 
The financial statement income is 
not determined by elected representa-
tives. In other words, Congress doesn’t 
determine how you calculate that tax. 
The financial statement income is ac-
tually determined by something called 
the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board, which is a private nonprofit rec-
ognized by the U.S. Securities and Ex-
change Commission as the accounting 
standard setter for public companies. 
Now, that works fine for determining 
accounting standards, but this change 
effectively puts these people in control 
of what the corporate tax base is, even 
though they are not elected Represent-
atives. They are not even working for 
the government. They are a nonprofit. 
Because corporate income taxes and 
this book minimum tax are calculated 
using these very different types of in-
formation, the 15-percent minimum 
tax, which is a book-tax minimum tax, 
can actually end up being larger for 
companies than the 21-percent income 
tax—again, because it calculates it dif-
ferently. 
It is an example of Congress avoiding 
its responsibility, frankly. If we think 
that we should charge companies more 
taxation, let’s look at the Tax Code 
and let’s get rid of some of these tax 
preferences that people think don’t 
work. Let’s change the Tax Code. Let’s 
not come up with another way to cal-
culate what the tax ought to be—deter-
mined, again, by accounting standards 
that are done by this nonprofit group 
called the Financial Accounting Stand-
ards Board. 
Instead of examining the Tax Code 
we created and the deductions and 
credits that exist, it simply hands the 
reins over to this board. Most account-
ants and tax experts recognize this is

August 2, 2022 
really a dangerous path. This is why, 
when it was proposed last year, 264 ac-
counting academics wrote to Congress 
to warn us not to do it. They warned of 
the dangers of politicizing this ac-
counting board, how that would lower 
the quality of financial accounting. 
They warned that this would change 
company decision making to make 
companies less efficient because com-
panies are now going to manage toward 
the financial statement, not toward 
the income tax. 
They also warned that it would add 
needless and significant complexity to 
the Tax Code. Well, of course, you are 
going to calculate, now, income on two 
bases, with very, very different meas-
urement and factors considered. 
To their credit, actually, the Amer-
ican Institute of Certified Public Ac-
countants, who actually stand to ben-
efit from complexity, separately also 
wrote us just recently a letter saying: 
Please don’t do this. This is the CPA 
organization in the whole country— 
again, people who would benefit from 
complexity—but they are saying this is 
just bad policy. Why would you deter-
mine a company’s taxation based on 
the book income? That is not what 
that is for. 
We should listen to these warnings, 
and we should also learn from history. 
We tried this type of tax in the form of 
the 1986 tax reform. We actually tried 
this as a country. And do you know 
what? It lasted 2 or 3 years, and then it 
was repealed. Why? Because it didn’t 
work. The exact warnings that we just 
talked about ended up being true. The 
Assistant Secretary of Treasury for 
Tax Policy told the House Ways and 
Means Committee when it was repealed 
that the book tax they had then was 
‘‘having a detrimental effect on the 
quality of financial reporting.’’ 
The 
complexity 
was 
complained 
about and the fact that this was not 
fair and was not an appropriate way to 
measure a company’s income. 
Now, more than 30 years later, Demo-
crats seem to have forgotten history 
and are about to repeat the same mis-
take. The line you are likely to hear 
from some of my colleagues on this 
side of the aisle is that this tax is just 
designed to make big companies pay 
their fair share of taxes because it only 
applies to companies who have more 
than a billion dollars in net income. 
Well, that is fine. But guess who pays 
this tax. It is not corporations that 
bear the brunt of it. 
In reality, taxes on corporate in-
come, such as this new book minimum 
tax, falls on workers and it falls on 
consumers. And there are lots of work-
ers and consumers who are connected 
with these companies. 
Last year, there were over 200 compa-
nies listed in the Fortune 500 as having 
a billion dollars in profits or more, and, 
by the way, they employed more than 
18 million Americans. You are talking 
about 18 million people out there who 
will be affected by this, and these big 
companies also have a lot of consumers 
well beyond those 18 million. So it is 
the millions of people who are employ-
ees and who are customers in these 
businesses who bear the brunt of these 
tax increases as they are passed down 
to them in the form of lower wages, 
lower benefits, and higher prices for 
goods and services—exactly the wrong 
thing in this inflationary spiral we are 
living in now where everything costs 
more. Why would we want to add addi-
tional costs by saying we are going to 
tax these companies that are going to 
pass it along to their workers and to 
the consumers with higher prices? 
It doesn’t matter whether you are 
taxing income or income on financial 
statements; the corporate income tax 
falls on these workers. Don’t take my 
word for it. Again, the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation just last year said 
that they expect about 25 percent of 
corporate taxes to fall on workers. This 
means lower wages, again, as this re-
cession looms and as inflation hits the 
highest levels since 1981, 40-plus years. 
By the way, we just went through our 
second quarter of negative economic 
growth. Traditionally, that means a re-
cession. That is how we define one. The 
administration refuses to call it a re-
cession. 
I will just tell you, for people who 
live in my home State of Ohio—par-
ticularly people on fixed income, lower 
and middle-income workers—they are 
feeling it. For them, it is a recession. 
In addition to the Joint Committee 
saying that the corporate taxes fall on 
workers, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice—again, a nonpartisan group up 
here in Congress—has said that em-
ployees and workers bear more like 70 
percent—70 percent—of the burden of 
corporate income taxes. 
There is a long list of analyses in be-
tween. In 2017, the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Develop-
ment, or OECD, reviewed many of the 
available economic studies around the 
world that have been done and found 
that the best studies fall within this 
range of about 30 to 70 percent. 
Let me say that again. Overwhelm-
ingly, economic studies support the 
idea that workers bear between 30 and 
70 percent of the corporate tax hikes. 
So going after workers’ wages is one 
heck of a strategy to bring down infla-
tion. People are already hurting be-
cause wages are here and inflation is 
here. So wages haven’t kept up with in-
flation. This will make it worse. 
Germany, by the way, did an analysis 
of corporate taxes recently and found 
that the burden fell hardest on low- 
skilled, young, and female employees, 
not the highest earners. 
The most important of these tax law 
changes is limiting what is called 
bonus depreciation. That is something 
that you would get as a company if you 
are in the regular income tax system 
but not under this new book tax cal-
culation. 
What is bonus depreciation? Well, it 
allows companies to deduct the costs of 
investments, of new equipment in the 
year they are made. Under the book 
tax, they spread that deduction over 
the lifetime of the investment. In both 
cases, they are deducting the cost of it, 
but whether they can do it imme-
diately under bonus depreciation or 
whether they have to do it over the 
course of many years matters a lot for 
investment decisions. 
Being able to deduct the cost of these 
investments immediately provides a 
big incentive for people to invest, and 
that is what has happened. This is not 
a loophole. I have heard this word: It is 
a loophole; we are just closing loop-
holes. 
This is not a loophole. This is a delib-
erate tax policy that we have put in 
place to help encourage companies to 
invest more in equipment and plan and 
therefore help the workers, therefore 
make America more competitive, and, 
actually, over time, it increases the 
tax revenue that comes in to our cof-
fers. 
It is really important to encourage 
investment and economic growth but 
particularly important for manufactur-
ers. That is why the Joint Committee 
on Taxation found that half of the bur-
den of this new tax will fall on manu-
facturers because bonus depreciation is 
so important to them. This isn’t 
unique to us. Every single developed 
country in the world offers a policy 
like bonus depreciation. Why? Because 
it works, because if they don’t and 
other countries do, they can’t compete. 
The United Kingdom is far more gen-
erous than ours, for example, for pur-
chase of equipment. Across the assets 
that use this sort of what is called cost 
recovery, we are actually well below 
the average in the OECD, which is the 
group of about 40 highly developed 
countries like ours. We rank 21st now 
out of 38 for these types of incentives. 
This will make us even less competi-
tive, meaning it is going to be better 
for manufacturers to invest in other 
countries that have better incentives 
rather than here in the USA. We want 
them to invest here. Again, we just 
passed legislation to provide more in-
centives to invest here, and now we are 
doing just the opposite through this 
book tax increase. 
Bonus 
depreciations 
traditionally 
had bipartisan support, and this sudden 
shift to call this bonus depreciation a 
loophole is a misrepresentation of what 
bonus depreciation does, why we have 
it, and how important it is for our 
manufacturers to compete. We ex-
panded bonus depreciation in the 2017 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And then in 
2018, the next year, and 2019, the next 
year after that, we had two of the best 
years ever for manufacturing invest-
ment, growing by 4.5 percent and then 
5.7 percent, respectively. A lot of that 
growth was going on, prior to that 
time, overseas, particularly in China. 
And we brought investment back to 
the United States. This is why, accord-
ing to the Joint Committee on Tax-
ation, the manufacturing industry is so 
hit hard by this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3871 
August 2, 2022 
According to the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers, in 2023, this tax 
increase would shrink GDP—that is our 
economic growth—by about $68 billion, 
would result in 218,000 fewer jobs, and 
it would have a labor decrease of about 
$17 billion. This is the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers telling us this 
week: Please don’t do this. This is 
going to result in a job loss to over 
200,000 jobs. We want to have more 
manufacturing jobs, not less. 
The workers hit hardest are those 
who work in manufacturing because 
this tax hike on physical assets will 
disproportionately hit manufacturing 
jobs. My home State of Ohio has a lot 
of manufacturing jobs. We are a big 
manufacturer. We are proud of that. 
We have a lot of factories. We like to 
make things. So it will particularly hit 
States like mine. 
But, remember, it is not just wages 
we are talking about. No. Workers get 
hit at both ends. They get hit as work-
ers—wages and benefits—but also as 
consumers when they get paid and 
when they try to spend their money. 
Families facing record inflation today 
are facing higher prices as cost of cor-
porate taxes get passed down to the 
consumer. Again, I am not going on 
gut feeling; although, it makes sense, 
doesn’t it? If you tax an entity, it gets 
passed along in terms of the cost of the 
goods. I am talking about what econo-
mists are saying is going to happen 
when we increase taxes on American 
businesses. 
In a key study last year performed by 
economists at the business schools of 
the University of Chicago and North-
western, they found that about 31 per-
cent of corporate taxes fall on con-
sumers through higher retail prices, 
and they warn that policymakers have 
been 
underestimating 
significantly 
how much of these taxes fall on con-
sumers, on the people that buy these 
products that these companies make. 
Democrats are ignoring this evi-
dence, pushing ahead with partisan leg-
islation, without any Republican sup-
port, that will make inflation worse; 
that will hurt workers; that will raise 
prices. 
Again, it doesn’t stop there. 
I can talk about how corporate taxes 
discourage investment, both domestic 
and foreign, in the United States, ac-
cording to economists from the World 
Bank and from Harvard. I can talk 
about how, contrary everything the 
Democrats 
claim, 
corporate 
taxes 
make 
income 
inequality 
actually 
worse, increasing the income of the top 
earners and lowering the income of the 
low- and middle-income workers. This 
is based on a 2020 study by an econo-
mist at the University of Michigan. 
I can talk about the opposite side of 
the equation, how lowering taxes for 
businesses of all sizes, as we did in 2017, 
supports economic growth. Going into 
the pandemic, we had 19 straight 
months of wage gains of 3 percent or 
more. Most of that wage gain was 
going to lower- and middle-income 
workers. We had the lowest poverty 
rate in the history of the country. We 
had good things going on because you 
had this economic growth. You had 
companies paying higher wages. 
In the years between the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act and the coronavirus pan-
demic, again, we not only saw just an 
end to these corporate inversions with 
companies going overseas, we saw jobs 
and investment coming back to the 
United States, and we kept inflation 
very low. That is a far cry from the es-
timate that was out last week from the 
National Association of Manufacturers, 
which, again, predicts that this book 
tax will result in a $68 billion hit to our 
economy with over 200,000 fewer jobs. 
Prior to the pandemic, pro-growth 
policies led to a really strong economy 
with steady growth, low inflation, and 
real wage increases of 3 percent or 
higher. Instead of spending and tax 
hikes that are only going to add to this 
inflation, let’s have a true Inflation 
Reduction Act that lowers costs to 
consumers by increasing supply to reg-
ulatory relief and other pro-growth 
policies that were working so well be-
fore the pandemic. Let’s do what we 
know we have to do to get inflation 
down. 
It is a mismatch between demand and 
supply. We can, through positive pro- 
growth policies, increase that supply 
and get inflation down and ensure that 
American families have a better shot 
at their American dream. Instead, here 
we go again with the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act that will actually be the ‘‘In-
flation Increase Act.’’

RECOGNIZING ART PULASKI 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 2, 2022 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Art Pulaski, who is retiring 
after 26 years with the California Labor Fed-
eration, AFL–CIO, which represents over 2 
million union members in manufacturing, 
transportation, construction, service and the 
public sector. 
Art has a long history with labor advocacy. 
He began his organizing career at age 16 
when, as a supermarket clerk, he joined the 
Amalgamated Meat Cutters Union. After work-
ing his way through college and graduate 
school, he worked as a union organizer. 
Art most recently served as the Chief Offi-
cer, after serving as the Executive Secretary- 
Treasurer, where he built coalitions with union 
and community groups to protect workers and 
retirees. Under his leadership, the Federation 
has more than doubled in size and has had 
numerous legislative achievements. The Fed-
eration restored daily overtime pay, raised the 
minimum wage, and passed the nation’s first 
Paid Family Leave law. 
In 2010, the Federation led a successful 
campaign to ensure that every California Dem-
ocrat in Congress voted in favor of the Afford-
able Care Act. Furthermore, in 2003, Art led 
the creation of the Stand for California Coali-
tion, a group of labor unions, religious organi-
zations, civil rights groups and business inter-
ests, as well as helped to develop the Apollo 
Alliance, a national coalition for cleaner energy 
and better jobs. 
Art has also served on numerous guber-
natorial panels and commissions on economic 
progress and workforce development. He was 
a founder of one of California’s model 
childcare centers, called PalCare, and served 
as president of nationally televised PBS series 
‘‘We Do the Work’’, the Labor Project for 
Working Families and the California Works 
Foundation. 
Art has spent his career protecting our com-
munity by advocating for workers, ensuring 
they are paid fairly, and improving workplace 
conditions. Art will be missed by the entire 
Federation but is looking forward to continuing 
his commitment to the labor community as a 
volunteer and spending time with his four chil-
dren: Erin, Katie, Luke, and Kaleb, and his two 
grandchildren, Wilder and August.

HONORING GENERAL MICHAEL 
LEPEILBET 
HON. DOUG LaMALFA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 2, 2022 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, today, I 
would like to recognize the life and service of 
my friend, Michael LePeilbet. 
Michael was a resident in Tehama County 
for over 20 years, a devout family-man with a 
heart of gold. His hard work and devotion to 
our community will be felt for generations. 
Michael received his A.S. in administration 
of justice from Antelope Valley College as well 
as his bachelors, and master’s degree in 
criminal justice from Pacific Western Univer-
sity. He graduated from the California Military 
Academy, U.S. Army Command and General 
Staff College, and U.S. Academy of Private In-
vestigation. 
Michael has been awarded many decora-
tions and awards. To name a few he received 
his Expert Infantry Badge, Army Aviator Wings 
for California, Basic Parachutist (Jump Wings), 
General Staff Badge (California State Military 
Reserve), Legion of Merit, Soldiers Medal, and 
plenty more. He rose through the ranks, be-
ginning in 1966 as a private (E–1) to becom-
ing a Brigadier General in later years. He 
served his country in the U.S. Army, the Na-
tional Guard, and the California State military 
reserve. He was also the owner of LePeilbet 
Investigation Service. 
Michael was someone you could count on 
and turn to. In my many trips to Nevada Coun-
ty, I will always have fond memories of stop-
ping by to see him and catching up on world 
events, or just to have a few minutes with a 
friend. 
After Michael’s retirement he felt that it was 
important to remain active in the community. 
He worked with the Boy Scouts, The American 
Legion, Masons, Shriners, VFW, the senior 
senate, and many other organizations. A large 
part of Michael’s life was helping others, 
Michael was a patriot who loved our country 
and a wonderful friend and will be greatly 
missed by all. Upon his passing, he leaves to 
cherish his memory and celebrate his legacy 
his wife, Linda; their five children: Nicolas, 
Jacob, Anita, Nancy, and Lorianne; eight 
grandchildren; and numerous other family 
members and friends. Today, I stand beside 
Linda and their family in this time of sorrow 
and profound personal loss. May God bless 
my friend, Michael. He is not forgotten. 
HONORING LIEUTENANT RICK 
SCHAEFER 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 2, 2022 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the great work that the 
U.S. Navy, Office of Naval Intelligence, 
Human Intelligence section’s Lieutenant Rick 
Schaefer did to protect our strategic naval as-
sets during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. 
In March of 1991, Lieutenant Schaefer, who 
after receiving a tip from the 3rd Armored Divi-
sion’s Counter-Intelligence section, personally 
investigated three Iraqi naval sites that had yet 
to be exploited and were to be ignored. Due 
to his initiative and sound judgment, the sites 
were investigated properly and revealed the 
official Iraqi naval minefield locations, which 
were unknown to U.S. forces. These plans led 
to the demining and safe passage of both ci-
vilian and military ships in Iraqi waters. 
Due to the decisive action of this sailor, un-
told lives were saved as well as the prevention 
of the potential loss of naval assets. His ac-
tions exemplify the honor and courage of our 
service members. We should applaud their ef-
forts.

SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
recognize the 107th birthday of Dania Beach 
Centenarian, Evelyn Dixon Williams. 
Evelyn Dixon Williams, a Dania Beach resi-
dent and pioneer, will celebrate her 107th 
birthday on August 2, 2022. Born in 1915, 
Mrs. Williams has witnessed much change in 
her lifetime and continues to be healthy and 
aware. She is someone who has been kind 
and generous throughout her lifetime and is 
truly an inspiration to others. 
Born in Mosely Town, Georgia, and raised 
in neighboring Vidalia, Evelyn Williams and 
her husband Alonzo Williams moved to Coco-
nut Grove, Florida, in 1935 and later relocated 
to Dania with their two sons—Deotis and 
Luriel. The Williams family were early mem-
bers of New Jerusalem Baptist Church in the 
Liberia (Hollywood) neighborhood, bordering 
Dania Beach. 
Mrs. Williams is an encouraging influence in 
our community, where she has supported 
young people in pursuing higher education 
and professional goals. She regularly visited 
elderly, homebound and nursing home resi-
dents—often bringing fruit, staying to read and 
pray, and always delivering a message of

CONTINENTAL DIVIDE TRAIL 
COMPLETION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 29, 2022 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of H.R. 5118, the 
Wildlife Response and Drought Resiliency Act. 
This much-needed legislation will take steps to 
help protect communities from the devastating 
consequences of extreme weather events by 
providing crucial investment and response 
measures to help prevent and respond to wild-
fire, drought, and other climate related weath-
er issues. These provisions include disaster 
assistance and environmental justice meas-
ures 
for 
communities 
disproportionately 
harmed by drought, wildfire, and other ex-
treme weather events. 
Extreme weather exacerbated by the cli-
mate crisis is increasingly wreaking havoc 
throughout our country, putting lives in danger 
while causing tremendous damage on private 
property and public lands. Currently, much of 
the western United States is experiencing the 
driest conditions in over 1,200 years. It is esti-
mated that 1 in 6 Americans live in areas of 
significant wildfire risk and more than 65 mil-
lion experienced severe to exceptional drought 
this summer. Portions of our country are suf-
fering under intense heat waves while in other 
places, too much rain in too short a period is 
causing flooding. My heart goes out to families 
of those who have died in flooding in Ken-
tucky, a toll that stood at 30 at last report, with 
many still missing. 
The Wildfire Response and Drought Resil-
iency Act includes policies and resources to 
strengthen federal efforts to better understand, 
prevent, and respond to wildfires and other ex-
treme weather events that are affecting our 
nation, including calling for a 10-year federal 
wildfire strategy and supporting our federal 
wildland firefighters and land managers who 
are on the frontlines in the fight to protect 
communities and lives. The bill would also cre-
ate a National Wildland Fire Risk Reduction 
Program that would coordinate Federal efforts 
to reduce the loss of life and property from 
wildland fires especially in the face of a 
changing climate. 
The Wildfire Response and Drought Resil-
iency Act delivers critical drought relief for 
communities in several ways including author-
izing 
investments 
in 
new 
water 
supply 
projects, promoting the delivery of reliable 
water to Native American communities, and 
supporting the development of technologies to 
enhance effective water management. 
I want to take a moment to highlight the 
bill’s provisions on environmental justice be-
cause we know that some communities bear a 
disproportionate share of the burden of ex-
treme weather events as they do environ-
mental hazards such as poor air and water 
quality, lead exposure, and other environ-
mental threats. For example, in Kentucky, 
some of the worse hit areas of the recent 
flooding are low-income. A recent EPA study 
found that people of color, regardless of re-
gion or income, are significantly more likely to 
live with exposure to air pollution. This leaves 
communities of color at a heightened risk of 
developing health complications like chronic 
bronchitis, reduced lung function, and in-
creased mortality from lung cancer and heart 
disease. A study by Clean Wisconsin found 
that people of color in my state are exposed 
to more ‘‘dangerous particulate matter’’ than 
the state average. 
This bill would authorize Environmental Jus-
tice Community, State, and Tribal Grant Pro-
grams to empower local nonprofits, state gov-
ernments, and tribal communities to identify 
and implement programs that reduce or elimi-
nate disproportionately adverse human health 
or environmental impacts in specific commu-
nities. For example, the bill authorizes new 
grants to develop community-led partnerships 
that implement projects addressing climate 
justice needs, like solar and wind energy, 
home and building electrification and weather-
ization, and electric vehicle charging infra-
structure. 
In addition, H.R. 5118 would establish a fed-
eral Environmental Justice Interagency Coun-
cil to guide federal agencies actions to identify 
and 
respond 
to 
environmental 
inequities 
among communities of color, tribal commu-
nities, and low-income communities. The bill 
would also require federal agencies to more 
closely consider the needs of and engage with 
communities that bear a disproportionate 
share of environmental burdens including by 
preparing community impact reports assessing 
the potential consequences of a proposed fed-
eral action on these communities. The bill 
would also require early and meaningful com-
munity involvement in federal actions under 
the National Environmental Policy Act review 
process. 
I support passage of this bill and urge my 
colleagues to do so as well.

COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
SECTION 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 2, 2022 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the great work that 3rd Ar-

Euchler, Craig Carlson, David Evans, Donald 
Wood, Thomas Lykens, Denis McMahon, 
Jesse Weiss, Joan Mercier, and Sharon Mack 
did to protect our strategic naval assets during 
Operation Desert Shield/Storm. 
In March of 1991 these soldiers, who be-
longed to 3rd Armored Division’s Counterintel-
ligence section, identified three Iraqi naval 
sites that had yet to be exploited. In coordina-
tion with U.S. Naval Intelligence, the sites 
were investigated properly, and revealed the 
official Iraqi naval minefield locations, which 
were unknown to U.S. forces. These plans led 
to the demining and safe passage of both ci-
vilian and military ships in Iraqi waters. 
Due to the decisive action of these soldiers, 
untold lives were saved as well as the preven-
tion of loss of naval assets. Their actions ex-
emplify the honor and courage of our service 
members. We should applaud their efforts.

vide Trail Completion Act;

ERAGE OF COVID TESTS 
HON. MARK POCAN 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 2, 2022 
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to extend remarks I made earlier this session 
during debate of this year’s National Defense 
Authorization Act. During that floor debate, 
and many times previously, I spoke about the 
lack of accountability at the Department of De-
fense and the need for enhanced oversight. In 
keeping with this lack of accountability not 
only to the American taxpayer, but Congress 
itself, I wish to publicly request information 
from the Department that my staff has solic-
ited since July of 2018. Namely, I seek infor-
mation on behalf of Wisconsin-based PFC 
Lawrence Gordon Foundation, a 501(c)(3) or-
ganization that works to locate and identify 
servicemembers who remain missing as a re-
sult of armed conflicts. This request for infor-
mation on behalf of a constituent is now enter-
ing its fifth year of processing—the time has 
come for the Department to be responsive to 
this records request. 
Additionally, I also wish to mention another 
concern relayed to me by a separate con-
stituent—TRICARE’s inability to reimburse 
beneficiaries for personally purchased COVID 
tests from local drugstores. I encourage the 
Secretary to examine this matter and consider 
amending TRICARE reimbursement practices, 
and I look forward to working with him to ad-
dress the concern (particularly during the cur-
rent increases in positivity rates across the 
country).

HONORING 
ERNEST 
MARVEL— 
WORLD WAR TWO VETERAN AND 
RECIPIENT OF THE LEGION OF 
HONOR 
HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER 
OF DELAWARE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 2, 2022 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor and congratulate Mr. 
Ernest B. Marvel, proud World War Two Vet-
eran and recent recipient of France’s highest 
distinction, the Ordre national de la Legion 
d’honneur, also known as the Legion of 
Honor. 
On July 13, 2022, Mr. Marvel was presented 
the Legion of Honor by the French Ambas-
sador to the United States, Phillipe Etienne. 
The Legion of Honor was first created over 
two centuries ago to reward eminent military 
and civil merits in service or defense of 
France. Created as an order of merit, foreign 
citizens may be awarded this recognition for 
their actions in support of France. For a World 
War Two Veteran like Mr. Marvel to be award-
ed the Legion of Honor, they must prove they 
were involved in combat operations within 
France. 
As a Private First Class with the 45th Infan-
try Division of the United States Army, Mr. 
Marvel’s service demonstrated exceptional 
bravery, character, and valor. Arriving in 
France shortly after the Battle of the Bulge, 
Mr. Marvel was soon given a vital mission to 
clear mines and booby traps. That mission 
brought Mr. Marvel and another soldier into di-
rect contact with enemy troops. For his suc-
cessful actions that day, Mr. Marvel was 
awarded the Bronze Star. After this action, Mr. 
Marvel participated in several dangerous com-
bat missions to help liberate France from Nazi 
Germany, including missions as a bazooka- 
man and in notable amphibious operations 
across the Rhine River. 
Despite the significant combat Mr. Marvel 
and his unit saw in Europe, perhaps the most 
harrowing experience was their actions to lib-
erate the victims in the Dachau Concentration 
Camp. As Mr. Marvel and the 45th Infantry Di-
vision moved toward Dachau, they were en-
gaged in fierce combat with German troops 
still defending the camp. Mr. Marvel would 
help liberate 32,000 captives of Dachau. But, 
as Mr. Marvel recalls, the ‘‘sights in this camp 
I will never ever forget.’’ 
Mr. Marvel was awarded numerous awards 
for his service, including the Bronze Star, the 
Combat Infantry Badge, and several campaign 
medals. With the latest award of the Legion of 
Honor, Mr. Marvel joins a distinguished group 
of Americans, including President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, Audie Murphy, Chuck Yeager, 
and many others. 
Finally, on behalf of the State of Delaware 
and a grateful Nation, I thank Mr. Marvel for 
his service to our country. He sacrificed great-
ly to safeguard freedom and democracy. He is 
a testament to our Nation and his actions 
were in keeping with the highest traditions of 
the United States Army. I congratulate Mr. 
Marvel once again on this honor—he brings 
great pride to Delaware and the United States.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
KARRIE WILSON WEATHERS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 2, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Karrie Wilson 
Weathers, 91, of Eggville. Mr. Weathers took 
his final flight Friday, July 29, 2022. He was 
born at home in Eggville on February 1, 1931, 
to the late Denver and Louie Weathers. He 
graduated from Mooreville High School in 
1951 where he was a basketball all-star. 
Karrie joined the U.S. Air Force serving in the 
Korean war. He retired after 25 years of serv-
ice as a Master Sergeant. 
After active duty, he became a partner with 
his brother, Dudley Weathers at Weathers 
Auto Supply. He started Capital Auto Glass in 
1966. Karrie also served as Lee County Tax 
Assessor, retiring after 16 years. Dedicated to 
serving others, Karrie was a member of the 
Lee County Shrine Club and a founding mem-
ber of The Flying Fez. He enjoyed flying chil-
dren to the Shriner’s Hospital in Galveston, 
Texas. He was also a 50 year member of the 
Tupelo Masonic Lodge 318, a founding mem-
ber of the Tupelo Korean War Veterans Asso-
ciation (KWVA), a 33rd-degree Scottish Rite 
Mason, and a founding member of the Tupelo 
Veterans Memorial Park. 
He enjoyed hunting and fishing. He was a 
private pilot for over 30 years. In Karrie’s own 
words, he enjoyed flying out of ‘‘Eggville Inter-
national Grass Airfield!’’ He was a member of 
Auburn Baptist Church. Karrie leaves behind 
his wife of 69 years, Barbara Finley Weathers; 
three children, Steve Weathers, Julie Weath-
ers Watson (Woody), Mark ‘‘Winky’’ Weathers 
(Roxy); 
eight 
grandchildren, 
LeAnna 
Hill

nah Treece (Nick), Emily Weathers, Tyler 
Weathers (Meagan), and Katie Weathers 
Gazaway (Mason); seven great-grandchildren; 
and a sister, Juanita Weathers Franks Knight 
(John). He was preceded in death by his par-
ents, Denver and Louie Weathers; his brother, 
Dudley Weathers, and a great-granddaughter, 
Sophie Gazaway.

RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN DAVID 
SUMAYA 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 2, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Hanford Fire Department Cap-
tain David Sumaya for his 33 years of service 
to the Central Valley community. 
Captain Sumaya was born and raised in 
Hanford, California. As a young man, he knew 
he wanted to serve the community he had 
lived in all his life and found the best way for 
him to do so was to become a firefighter. In 
1989, he began his work in the fire service 
and joined Hanford Volunteer Firefighters. As 
a volunteer firefighter, he ran calls out of the 
old Lacey Boulevard Fire Station, even work-
ing on fire engines from the 1940s. 
In 1991, Captain Sumaya was hired as a 
full-time firefighter with the Hanford Fire De-
partment. Throughout his decorated career, he 
held every position in the Department, eventu-
ally rising to the rank of Captain. Additionally, 
he served as one of the original members of 
the Hanford Fire Department Investigation 
team, helping the Department understand the 
causes of fires throughout the community. 
Over his three decades of service, Captain 
Sumaya served as a role model for all mem-
bers of the Hanford Fire Department. He has 
been a source of inspiration for young fire-
fighters in the Department, and a great re-
source for veteran members. His dedication to 
his community is an inspiration to us all, and 
his legacy within the Hanford Fire Department 
will live on forever. 
I ask all my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring Captain 
David Sumaya for his 33 years of service and 
dedication to the City of Hanford.

HONORING SHERIFF DEVON BELL 
HON. DOUG LaMALFA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 2, 2022 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to recognize my good friend, Placer County 
Sheriff Devon Bell. We celebrate his retire-
ment and job well done regarding his service 
and legacy to the people of Placer County and 
the State of California. 
Working with Sheriff Bell for over 12 years 
has been a pleasure. I have enjoyed the 
friendship that has developed as we have 
partnered on many critical issues. He has 
proven to be someone I can always depend 
on, and his deep devotion to public safety 
made it easy for me to support him. 
Since 1992 Sheriff Bell has been committed 
to protecting the citizens of Placer County. I 
am not surprised how he rose through the 
ranks. Devon is a man of integrity, humor, 
dedicated work ethic, and a friend to many. 
He is a man of great character who can be 
trusted to do the right thing. 
Sheriff Bell holds bachelor of arts in criminal 
justice management from Union Institute and 
University, a master of arts in security studies 
from the Naval Postgraduate School and is a 
graduate of the FBI National Academy’s 
222nd Session. This education, coupled with 
his decades of experience, provided him the 
background needed to be elected 28th Sheriff- 
Coroner-Marshall of Placer County. 
Sheriff Bell has been active in the California 
State Sheriffs Association for nearly 20 years. 
He began as a legislative committee member, 
where his voice was essential in passing and 
rallying against legislation affecting law en-
forcement throughout California. Devon has 
served in many capacities on the California 
State Sheriffs Association Board of Directors 
and was the Second Vice President at retire-
ment. 
I have observed Sheriff Bell’s devotion to 
those in the law enforcement community and 
our community in the time he spent on the 
KidsFirst Board and the Placer Sheriffs Activity 
League. His service to our community was in-
dispensable and appreciated. 
I wish the best to Devon, Sue, and their 
children and grandchildren in his retirement. 
Wherever their path takes them and for all the 
adventures yet to come, I am grateful for the 
time he and his family sacrificed for our com-
munity. 
God bless my friend Devon on this next 
chapter in his life. I thank him for all he has 
done for us here in the North State. Best wish-
es in retirement. 
WELCOMING PAUL DILLARD TO 
NEW JERSEY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 2, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to welcome Paul E. Dillard, National 
Commander of The American Legion, as he 
visits American Legion posts in New Jersey’s 
Third Congressional District. The Commander 
has a busy schedule across New Jersey, but 
I am proud that he will be visiting posts in 
Toms River, Brick, and Seaside Heights. 
Commander Dillard honorably served in the 
U.S. Navy in Vietnam through four campaigns, 
including the Tet Offensive. He later received 
an honorable discharge as a radarman sec-
ond-class petty officer from the Navy Reserve 
before attending Grayson County Junior Col-
lege and East Texas State University. 
As we hope for all of our veterans, Com-
mander Dillard was able to resettle back in his 
home State of Texas and started a family with 
his wife, Donna, and a successful insurance 
business practice focused on employee bene-
fits. 
As a paid-up-for-life member of American 
Legion Post 265 in Lake Kiowa, Texas, Dillard 
served as post commander, vice commander, 
adjutant, and judge advocate. He coached 
American Legion Baseball for more than 10 
years and served as his post’s Boys State 
chairman. Commander Dillard was elected in 
2021 and has set a theme of ‘‘No Veteran Left 
Behind.’’ 
Representing a district that has one of the 
largest concentrations of veterans in the coun-
try, serving them and honoring their sacrifice 
is one of my highest priorities in Congress. 
The simple promise we make is that if some-
one steps up to protect us, our families, and 
our Nation’s security, we will have their backs 
for the rest of their lives. Our country has not 
always kept this promise, but I look forward to 
working with Commander Dillard and The 
American Legion to work for a better future for 
our veterans and their families so they receive 
the benefits they have earned. I have no 
doubt Commander Dillard will enjoy his time 
visiting with his American Legion family in 
New Jersey and wish him continued success 
in his term as National Commander.
