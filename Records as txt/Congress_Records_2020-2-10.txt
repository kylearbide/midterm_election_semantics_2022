RECOGNIZING 
NORTH 
CAROLINA 
SENATOR TOM MCINNIS, CITIZEN 
OF THE YEAR 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, North Carolina State Senator 
Tom McInnis of Rockingham has been 
named ‘‘Citizen of the Year’’ by the 
Richmond Community College Founda-
tion, and I rise to comment on this 
well-deserved honor for my friend. Tom 
is an alumnus of RCC, and I know this 
distinction is meaningful to him. 
I was privileged to serve with Tom in 
the North Carolina Senate and have 
worked closely with him to learn and 
serve the needs of Richmond County in 
the time leading to and since my elec-
tion in the House. That experience 
deepened my appreciation for Tom’s 
love for Rockingham and Hamlet and 
the rest of Richmond County and his 
personal force in advocating for the 
needs and advancement of his people— 
and I mean everybody. 
The citizenship award specifically 
recognizes Tom’s effort and success in 
promoting workforce training for rural 
North Carolina. And Tom has devoted 
much of his adult life to improving 
educational opportunity, especially. 
Tom grew up on a Richmond County 
farm. He put himself through school 
and started multiple businesses. In 
1983, he founded Iron Horse Auction 
Company, which, in 2013, was named 
one of the top 10 auction companies in 
the United States. He was elected to 
the North Carolina Auctioneers Asso-
ciation Hall of Fame in 1994. 
Tom’s public life began with 8 years’ 
service on the Richmond County Board 
of Education. Tom is now in his third 
term in the Senate, where he serves as 
chairman of the Transportation Com-
mittee. 
Tom played a key role in securing 
funding for workforce training at Rich-
mond Community College, including 
programs for truck driver training and 
electrical linemen. Since just the fall 
of 2016, the trucking program has grad-
uated 50 new drivers into the workforce 
with highly marketable skills. The 
lineman program started last fall and 
already has a waitlist. 
Tom will never forget his rural roots, 
and his people will never forgot his 
hard work and service on their behalf. 
I am proud to call him a colleague, 
mentor, and friend.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick

Loving God, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
As we meditate on all the blessing of

of peace in our lives and in our world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H980 
February 10, 2020 
CIVILITY IN CONGRESS 
(Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, it is 
a fresh week in Washington. Last week, 
division infected this Capitol, both 
sides, Republicans and Democrats. 
The State of the Union is supposed to 
be a time of coming together as Ameri-
cans, coming together to improve jobs, 
healthcare, the environment, and the 
lives of hardworking men and women, 
seniors, and their families. 
On Friday, I couldn’t wait to get 
home. I went home and spent time with 
people in my district. 
People 
donned 
costumes 
in 
the 
Michigan 
Law 
Enforcement 
Polar 
Plunge for Special Olympics. I didn’t 
jump, but I laughed. 
The University of Michigan won a 
hard-fought game against Michigan 
State. Yes, go Blue. And now, we come 
together as one Michigan. 
We had serious, important conversa-
tions about the division in this country 
and how we must come together. 
As we work on the people’s business 
this week, I hope we remember we can 
disagree agreeably and respect others’ 
opinions and the need to listen to each 
other and understand different perspec-
tives. We are all Americans. 
f 
CONGRATULATING THOMAS MAY 
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate Mr. Thomas 
May on receiving the University of Ar-
kansas System President’s Medal for 
Service. 
This award is given by the school’s 
president and cabinet to recognize 
those who have committed to helping 
the UA System through their time, 
knowledge, and philanthropy. 
Tommy May has long been a resident 
of the Fourth Congressional District 
and was previously the president and 
CEO of Simmons Bank. Mr. May is also 
the only person in Arkansas history to 
have served as both chairman of the 
board and acting president of the Uni-
versity of Arkansas System. 
His contributions to the University 
of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and 
the University of Arkansas at Pine 
Bluff have led to growth, development, 
and successes at both institutions. 
Mr. May is a dedicated leader, and 
his service shows how much wise stew-
ardship can accomplish in the lives of 
others. Tommy has been an inspiration 
to many as he continues to serve oth-
ers and make a difference in many 
lives, all while dealing with ALS in his 
own life. 
I take this time to congratulate 
Tommy May once again on this tre-
mendous honor and thank him for his 
tremendous courage and service to our 
district and our State. 
CELEBRATING MARGIE GARVIN 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today during Black History 
Month 
to 
celebrate 
a 
remarkable 
woman and a fierce advocate for Staten 
Island’s African American community, 
Ms. Margie Garvin. 
Sadly, Margie’s unyielding commit-
ment to increasing voter awareness 
was spurred by her own experience 
with racism after she moved to Staten 
Island’s Park Hill Houses in 1979. When 
Margie went to borough hall to try to 
update her voter registration a man 
there mockingly told Margie: ‘‘You 
people don’t vote.’’ 
‘‘Well, if my people don’t vote,’’ she 
said, ‘‘where can I go get some voter 
registration forms?’’ 
Ever 
since, 
she 
has 
been 
an 
unstoppable force on Staten Island, 
registering voters and getting people 
out to the polls. 
In between election days, she is out 
there in the community, demanding 
better playgrounds for kids, holding 
her elected officials accountable, cook-
ing meals for seniors, and so much 
more. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
celebrating Ms. Margie Garvin, who is 
on the ground in the community, put-
ting in the hard work to make New 
York City’s Staten Island and the 
United States of America a better 
place. 
f 
RECOGNIZING PUBLIC SERVICE OF 
CARMEN GUTIERREZ 
(Mr. HURD of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of the tre-
mendous public service of Mrs. Carmen 
Gutierrez. 
Carmen has served for 5 years as my 
Del Rio district representative, deliv-
ering the gold standard in constituent 
services to the people of Terrell, Val 
Verde, Kinney, and Uvalde Counties. 
Carmen was born and raised in Texas 
and has made it her life’s work to give 
back to her community. Before work-
ing for my office, Carmen served as dis-
trict equipment superintendent at the 
Texas Department of Transportation, 
becoming the first female in history to 
serve in that role. 
Carmen has played an integral role in 
her community and is beloved by those 
who call her friend and neighbor. When 
you walk through Del Rio, everyone 
knows her name. 
At the end of February, Carmen will 
retire from public service. It is a re-
tirement that is well earned: scores of 
constituent cases closed, hundreds of 
lives touched, and now a loving family 
eagerly awaits more time with Carmen. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating Carmen on 
her distinguished career and upcoming 
retirement. 
ILLUMINATING THE LEGACY OF 
CURT FLOOD 
(Mr. CLAY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, this Black 
History Month, I ask my colleagues to 
join efforts to illuminate the legacy of 
a true American hero, the late Major 
League Baseball All-Star center fielder 
Curt Flood. 
In addition to 12 stellar seasons with 
the St. Louis Cardinals, Curt Flood 
struck a blow for dignity and civil 
rights by challenging a rule which al-
lowed players to be traded against 
their will. 
He noted in his refusal: ‘‘After 12 
years in the major leagues, I do not 
feel I am a piece of property to be 
bought and sold irrespective of my 
wishes. I believe that any system 
which produces that result violates my 
basic rights as a citizen and is incon-
sistent with the laws of the United 
States.’’ 
My great friend Congressman TRONE 
and I are asking Members to join in a 
letter supporting the induction of Curt 
Flood into the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
Flood’s struggles might have ended 
his career, but he blazed a trail for the 
rights enjoyed by players today. It is 
this type of leadership and lasting con-
tribution we recognize this Black His-
tory Month. 
f 
RECOGNIZING PAUL GRASSEY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Paul 
Grassey, who received the French Le-
gion of Honor by the Consul General of 
France on January 28 for his role in 
liberating France during World War II. 
During the war, Paul flew B–24 bomb-
ers for the Eighth Air Force in 13 mis-
sions. After the war, Mr. Grassey re-
turned to Savannah and became heav-
ily involved with the Mighty Eighth 
Air Force Museum, helping to educate 
people in the area about the Eighth Air 
Force’s role in the war. 
Paul gives tours at the museum and 
often goes into local schools to talk 
about the importance of World War II 
and freeing Europe from Nazi Ger-
many. 
In 2013, Paul wrote a book outlining 
his story before, during, and after the 
war while discussing the six pillars of 
having 
good 
character: 
trust-
worthiness, 
respect, 
responsibility, 
fairness, caring, and citizenship. 
The French Legion of Honor is the 
highest military honor in France, and I 
could not be more proud that the Con-
sul General has awarded it to Mr. 
Grassey of the First Congressional Dis-
trict of Georgia. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. 
Grassey on his award. I thank him for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H982 
February 10, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume, and I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 1494, the Historically 
Black 
Colleges 
and 
Universities 
(HBCUs) Homeland Security Partner-
ships Act. 
Mr. Speaker, historically Black col-
leges and universities, HBCUs, and mi-
nority-serving institutions, MSIs, play 
a pivotal role in American society. 
HBCUs, which make up only 3 percent 
of the United States’ institutions of 
higher education, produce nearly 30 
percent of all bachelor’s degrees earned 
by African Americans in science, tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics, 
or STEM fields. 
My State, New Mexico, is home to 18 
Hispanic-serving institutions, which, 
like HBCUs, produce a large percentage 
of underrepresented minorities who 
study and work in STEM. Nationwide, 
Hispanic-serving institutions account 
for 66 percent of the more than 3.5 mil-
lion undergraduate Hispanics enrolled 
in higher education. 
The contributions of HBCUs, HSIs, 
and other minority-serving institu-
tions prove that, when these institu-
tions have equitable opportunities, it 
drives our economy and improves out-
comes within minority communities. 
It is also true of these institutions’ 
ability to do work for the Federal Gov-
ernment. The Department of Homeland 
Security, DHS, specifically has always 
understood the value of working with 
such institutions. However, the part-
nership is nowhere near its full poten-
tial. DHS has even acknowledged that 
its existing programs for engaging with 
HBCUs are being underutilized. 
H.R. 1494 would require DHS to issue 
a strategy with yearly goals to en-
hance these partnerships. This strategy 
will include specific measurable goals 
to ensure the Department’s progress in 
working with HBCUs and HSIs. 
Mr. Speaker, Federal investment in 
and partnership with HBCUs and MSIs 
is vital for the strength of our economy 
and the advancement of our society. I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill 
to ensure effective partnership between 
DHS and HBCUs and MSIs. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS, 
Washington, DC, January 30, 2020. 
Hon. BENNIE THOMPSON, 
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: I am writing 
with respect to H.R. 1494, the ‘‘Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) 
Homeland 
Security 
Partnerships 
Act.’’ 
Thank you for consulting with the Com-
mittee on Small Business regarding the mat-
ters in H.R. 1494 that fall within the Com-
mittee’s jurisdiction. 
As a result of your consultation with us on 
this measure and in order to expeditiously 
move the bill to the floor, I forego further 
consideration of H.R. 1494. The Committee 
on Small Business takes this action with our 
mutual understanding that we do not waive 
any jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this or similar legislation, and the 
Committee will be appropriately consulted 
and involved as the bill or similar legislation 
moves forward so that we may address any 
remaining issues that fall within our juris-
diction. Further, I request your support for 
the appointment of an appropriate number of 
conferees from the Committee on Small 
Business 
during 
any 
House-Senate 
con-
ference involving this or similar legislation. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming our understanding 
regarding H.R. 1494 and would ask that a 
copy of our exchange of letters on this mat-

COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, January 30, 2020. 
Hon. NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN VELA´ ZQUEZ: Thank you 
for your letter regarding H.R. 1494, the ‘‘His-
torically Black Colleges and Universities 
Homeland Security Partnerships Act.’’ I rec-
ognize that the Committee on Small Busi-
ness has a jurisdictional interest in H.R. 
1494, and appreciate your effort to allow this 
bill to be considered on the House floor. 
I concur with you that forgoing action on 
the bill does not in any way prejudice the 
Committee on Small Business with respect 
to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill 
or similar legislation in the future, and I 
would support your effort to seek appoint-
ment of an appropriate number of conferees 
to any House—Senate conference involving 
this legislation. 
I will include our letters on H.R. 1494 in the 
Congressional Record during floor consider-
ation of this bill. I look forward to working 
with you on this legislation and other mat-
ters of great importance to this nation. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 1494, the His-
torically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities 
(HBCUs) 
Homeland 
Security 
Partnerships Act. 
H.R. 1494 seeks to increase partner-
ships and opportunities between his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities, or HBCUs, and the Department 
of Homeland Security. 
The bill requires DHS to develop a 
departmentwide strategy to enhance 
partnerships with HBCUs and minor-
ity-serving institutions and seeks to 
further such partnerships, specifically 
in relation to the research and develop-
ment activities of DHS. 
I applaud my colleague, the chairman 
of the Homeland Security Committee, 
for his efforts to bring this bill for-
ward. I think this is an important un-
dertaking that will improve the work 
of DHS. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of my 
bill, H.R. 1494, the Historically Black 
Colleges 
and 
Universities 
(HBCUs) 
Homeland Security Partnerships Act. 
As a two-time HBCU graduate, I have 
long been an advocate of these impor-
tant institutions and creating more op-
portunities for them to work with the 
Federal Government. Throughout the 
15 years that I have served on the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security, I have 
made it a priority to facilitate dia-
logue between the HBCUs and the De-
partment of Homeland Security on how 
to build meaningful partnerships. 
As the gentlewoman from New Mex-
ico has already mentioned, HBCUs and 
minority-serving institutions have and 
continue to make great contributions 
to American society. That is why it is 
critical that we encourage DHS to 
strengthen 
partnerships 
between 
HBCUs and MSIs. 
After Hurricanes Katrina and Maria, 
it became clear how the absence of in-
dividuals from minority communities 
in homeland security decisionmaking, 
such as emergency management and 
planning, hinders our ability to serve 
all affected communities equally. 
Minority communities are dispropor-
tionately impacted by natural hazards 
and disasters. It is imperative that the 
students of those communities—HBCU 
and MSI students—are not left on the 
sidelines and are encouraged to con-
tribute to such planning and equipped 
to respond. 
Enactment of my bill will take a step 
in this direction, as it requires DHS to 
develop a strategy to strengthen its ca-
pacity to provide research and develop-
ment, contracting, and internships and 
career opportunities to HBCUs and 
MSIs and their students or recent grad-
uates. 
The bill also requires the Department 
to do more outreach and disseminate 
more information to these institutions. 
Such information includes internships 
and 
career 
opportunities 
and 
how 
HBCUs and MSIs may qualify to par-
ticipate in Federal acquisitions. 
I thank my colleague from Missouri, 
Representative LUETKEMEYER, for his 
support on this important measure. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on its passage. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I am prepared 
to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1494 seeks to facili-
tate dialogue between the Department 
of Homeland Security and HBCUs and 
MSIs on how to find areas of oppor-
tunity to build more productive part-
nerships. Collaborating with these di-
verse institutions is not only economi-
cally and culturally beneficial, it is

necessary to effectively respond to cur-
rent, emerging, and consistent home-
land security threats. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 1494 the Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Homeland 
Security Partnerships Act. This legislation 
would require the Department of Homeland 
Security to develop a strategy to strengthen 
the partnerships between the Department and 
HBCU’s. In turn, this would expose the tal-
ented students attending these institutions to 
more robust recruitment and hiring by the De-
partment along with better cooperation by 
these institutions in DHS research and testing 
programs. 
HBCU’s and other Minority Serving Institu-
tions have provided a quality education to mil-
lions of Americans seeking to gain knowledge 
and to better their career prospects. Many of 
the students who are attending these institu-
tions come from diverse backgrounds and are 
the first in their families to pursue a postsec-
ondary education. It is my strong belief that 
our federal workforce should be as diverse as 
possible so that the work our government 
does can impact all Americans. With the pas-
sage of this legislation today, the Department 
of Homeland Security will take a step towards 
a more diverse workforce. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. TORRES SMALL) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1494, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

PROTECTING AMERICA’S FOOD 
AND AGRICULTURE ACT OF 2019 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the

Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Sen-
ator PETERS’ bill, the Protecting Amer-
ica’s Food and Agriculture Act of 2019. 
This bill comes at a time of crisis for 
America’s 
agricultural 
industry. 
Threats from illnesses abroad endanger 
the domestic pork industry, while 
trade tensions have strained relation-
ships with the international consumers 
our Nation’s farmers supply. 
The African swine flu, ASF, is a par-
ticular threat. A devastating illness 
that is still being studied, this flu has 
not made its way to the United States, 
and steps are being taken to ensure 
that it does not. 
b 1545 
Agricultural inspectors within U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection are 
crucial in protecting our livestock and 
agricultural products from potential 
disease outbreaks. They are charged 
with scanning all incoming agricul-
tural cargo and passengers to ensure 
that products are not coming into the 
United States that are diseased or con-
tain pests. 
S. 2107 provides for the hiring of addi-
tional inspectors to augment the work-
force that is in place at our ports of 
entry. 
I 
commend 
Senator 
GARY 
PETERS
for introducing this timely 
measure and also acknowledge my

House 
colleague, 
Representative 
FILEMON VELA, who introduced com-
panion legislation. 
The need for greater agricultural in-
spection resources at the border is crit-
ical. That is why stakeholders and 
leaders from across the Nation have 
spoken out in support of S. 2107. The 
message from over 150 organizations 
that either produce pork or are in-
volved in the industry and the Gov-
ernors from Utah, North Dakota, Ohio, 
Arkansas, 
Tennessee, 
Idaho, 
South 
Carolina, South Dakota, Iowa, Ne-
braska, and Oklahoma is loud and 
clear: Get this bill to the President so 
it can be enacted into law. 
This level of support demonstrates 
the vital need to pass this legislation 
with all possible haste. We must pro-
vide CBP with the resources needed to 
ensure a continued vitality of the 
American agricultural industry. 
Today, we are protecting American 
pork. Tomorrow, it may be New Mexi-
can chiles. That is why this is so im-
portant. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
Washington, DC, February 3, 2020. 
Hon. BENNIE THOMPSON, 
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: This letter con-
firms our mutual understanding regarding S. 
2107, the ‘‘Protecting America’s Food and 
Agriculture Act of 2019’’. Thank you for col-
laborating with the Committee on Agri-
culture on the matters within its jurisdic-
tion. 
The Committee on Agriculture will forego 
any further consideration of this bill so that 
it may proceed expeditiously to the House 
floor. However, by foregoing consideration at 
this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction 
over the subject matter contained in this or 
similar legislation. We request that our com-
mittee be consulted and involved as this bill 
or similar legislation moves forward so that 
we may address any remaining issues in our 
jurisdiction. Our committee also reserves 
the right to seek appointment of an appro-
priate number of conferees to any House- 
Senate conference involving this or similar 
legislation and ask that you support any 
such request. 
We would appreciate a response to this let-
ter confirming this understanding with re-
spect to S. 2107, and request that a copy of 
our letters on this matter be published in the 
Congressional Record during Floor consider-
ation. 
Sincerely,

I will include our letters on S. 2107 in the

with you on this legislation and other mat-
ters of great importance to this nation. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of S. 2107, the Pro-
tecting 
America’s 
Food 
and 
Agri-
culture Act of 2019. 
As we know, much of the food and ag-
ricultural goods we consume come 
from all over the world, whether it be 
fruit, vegetables, herbs, or cut flowers. 
As food and other agricultural goods 
arrive at our ports of entry, U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection agricul-
tural specialists have a tremendous re-
sponsibility. They inspect those prod-
ucts to safeguard the U.S. food supply, 
the economy, and agriculture from po-
tentially harmful or dangerous pests, 
pathogens, 
invasive 
plants, 
and 
agroterrorism. 
CBP has advised Congress that there 
are hundreds of agriculture-related po-
sition vacancies at the agency on top 
of thousands of Border Patrol, customs 
officer, and other law enforcement va-
cancies. S. 2107 encourages CBP to hire, 
train, and assign agriculture special-
ists and associated support staff, tech-
nicians, and K–9 teams, and authorizes 
appropriations to do so. 
The bill requires CBP to consider 
quantifiable inspection data, seasonal 
surge volumes, and projected changes 
in commercial forecasts at each port of 
entry when determining staffing needs. 
The bill also directs the Comptroller 
General to conduct a review of Federal 
efforts to address risks to the agricul-
tural supply that analyzes interagency 
coordination, effectiveness of inspec-
tions, and training and working condi-
tions. 
While I support this bill, I also en-
courage my colleagues to work across 
the aisle to provide CBP with the re-
sources necessary to fill all of their 
sensitive position vacancies, including 
those at Border Patrol. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support S. 2107, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
I rise in strong support of S. 2107, the 
Protecting America’s Food and Agri-
culture Act of 2019. 
Americans are blessed to live in a 
country where, in most communities, 
we can find healthy, fresh foods at our 
grocery stores. That does not just hap-
pen. Our Nation’s food supply and agri-
cultural industry make it happen. 
As such, the agricultural industry is 
an indispensable sector of our national 
economy. Every year, millions and mil-
lions of pounds of fresh fruits, vegeta-
bles, cheeses, and meats enter the 
United States via commercial ship-
ments from other countries. 
While this flow of agricultural trade 
is fundamental to our economy and 
way of life, it does carry with it risk of 
importation diseases, pests, and com-
promised products. 
To address this risk, agricultural in-
spectors in the U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection inspect incoming food 
and agricultural goods at our land, air, 
and sea ports. 
Additionally, these inspectors inter-
view passengers on incoming inter-
national flights to determine whether 
they are carrying prohibited agricul-
tural items, because even an accidental 
transmission of a foreign pest or dis-
ease into our country could potentially 
devastate our agricultural system. 
With African swine flu rampant in 
Asia, accounting for the deaths of mil-
lions of pigs as a result of disease, or to 
control this deadly disease, it is crit-
ical that the U.S. have adequate in-
spection resources in place. 
S. 2107 would help ensure that we 
have agriculture inspectors in place to 
perform this critical mission. 
I commend my counterpart in the 
Senate Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs Committee, Senator 
GARY
PETERS, and my former com-
mittee 
colleague 
Representative 
FILEMON VELA for their leadership on 
this timely effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this measure and 
send this bill to the President’s desk. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. BOST). 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of S. 2107, 
which will help ensure the safety and 
security of our agricultural imports. 
The U.S. agriculture sector is a vi-
tally important component of the 
American economy. In my district 
alone, agriculture is responsible for 
over 30,000 jobs and adds $2 billion to 
the economy. 
In China, African swine fever has 
killed more hogs than the entire U.S. 
herd combined. We must do everything 
we can to protect our domestic herds 
against the same fate. 
In authorizing more CBP agriculture 
specialists and K–9 teams at our ports 
of entry, we can ensure the safety of 
our livestock while preserving billions 
of dollars in potential losses to Amer-
ican agriculture. 
On behalf of thousands of livestock 
producers in my district, I urge my col-
leagues to support the passage of this 
bill. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. VELA).

bill authorizes the hiring of additional 
agricultural specialists, agricultural

curity, House of Representatives, Wash-

DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON
AND RANKING 
MEMBER
ROGERS: I appreciate your work 
leading the House Committee on Homeland 
Security. I write today in support of H.R. 
4482, Protecting America’s Food & Agri-
culture Act of 2019. The bill would authorize 
funding to hire additional Customs and Bor-
der Protection (CBP) personnel to help con-
duct Agriculture Quarantine Inspection serv-
ices at the United States’ ports of entry. 
Utah has a robust agricultural sector, in-
cluding a pork industry that is an important 
part of our state’s economy. We are genu-
inely concerned about the potential impact 
of agricultural pests and diseases, including 
African Swine Fever. The Fever has not yet 
impacted the United States, but is wreaking 
havoc in other parts of the world and would 
pose a significant threat to the U.S. pork in-
dustry. 
Through regional and national partner-
ships, we spend considerable effort as a state 
to detect and combat diseases and prevent 
outbreaks. However we need the federal gov-
ernment’s support to prevent disease trans-
missions from foreign sources. 
Thank you again for your work, and please 
let me know if can be helpful. 
Sincerely, 
GARY R. HERBERT, 
Governor.

MEMBER ROGERS: We the undersigned Gov-
ernors request that the Committee on Home-
land Security swiftly report out without 
amendment H.R. 4482, Protecting America’s 
Food & Agriculture Act of 2019. This bill au-
thorizes funding to hire additional Customs 
and 
Border 
Protection 
(CBP) 
personnel 
which are critically needed to conduct Agri-
culture Quarantine Inspection services at 
the Unites States’ ports of entry. The Senate 
version of this bill, S. 2107, has been ap-
proved by the Senate by unanimous consent 
and we are hopeful that it will be placed on 
the House suspension calendar. 
The U.S. agriculture sector is vital to the 
American economy, generating over $1 tril-
lion in annual economic activity. Threats to 
the vitality of American agriculture present 
a danger to economic security at the local 
and state level across our nation. Indeed, the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture has cal-
culated that foreign agricultural pests and 
diseases already cost the American economy 
tens of billions of dollars annually. We must 
vigilantly protect our borders against dis-
eases such as African Swine Fever (ASF), 
which has killed more than one out of every 
four pigs on the planet and would have a dev-
astating impact on U.S. livestock producers, 
their communities, and the economy if it 
were to reach the USA. 
CBP employees perform critically impor-
tant agricultural inspections every day at 
our nation’s ports of entry. CBP Agricultural 
Specialists play a vital role in both trade 
and travel safety and preventing the intro-
duction of harmful foreign animal diseases 
such as ASF and exotic plant pests into the 
U.S. CBP has been chronically understaffed 
at the ports of entry and currently reports a 
deficit of 721 Agriculture Specialists. Pas-
sage of the Protecting America’s Food and 
Agriculture Act of 2019 will help close this 
gap by authorizing the hiring of 240 CBP Ag-
riculture Specialists and 200 CBP Agri-
culture Technicians each year until the 
staffing shortage is closed. 
The bill also authorizes the training and 
assignment each year of 20 new Agricultural 
Canine Teams, which are valuable assets in 
the detection of illicit fruits, vegetables and 
animal products that otherwise may be 
missed during inspections. These specially 
trained dogs have already demonstrated 
their ability to sniff out agricultural prod-
ucts that pose a danger. Finally, the bill au-
thorizes supplemental appropriations each 
year to pay for the activities of the agri-
culture specialists, technicians and canine 
teams. 
We ask that Congress authorize and fund 
the needed CBP Agriculture Specialists, Ca-
nine Teams and support staff to fully staff 
our international ports of entry. This invest-
ment will significantly enhance mitigation 
of national security threats, address public 
safety risks and grow the economy. We urge 
you to quickly discharge S. 2107/H.R. 4482 
without amendments and advocate for its 
swift passage on the House suspension cal-
endar. 
Sincerely, 
Hon. Doug Burgum, Governor of North Da-
kota; Hon. Mike DeWine, Governor of Ohio; 
Hon. Gary Herbert, Governor of Utah; Hon. 
Asa Hutchinson, Governor of Arkansas; Hon. 
Bill Lee, Governor of Tennessee; Hon. Brad 
Little, Governor of Idaho; Hon. Henry 
McMaster, Governor of South Carolina; Hon. 
Kristi Noem, Governor of South Dakota; 
Hon. Kim Reynolds, Governor of Iowa; Hon. 
Pete Ricketts, Governor of Nebraska; Hon. 
Kevin Stitt, Governor of Oklahoma.

House of Representatives, House Committee on 
Homeland Security, Washington, DC. 
Ranking Member MIKE ROGERS, 
House of Representatives, Committee on Home-
land Security, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON
AND RANKING 
MEMBER ROGERS: The undersigned groups re-
quest that the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity expeditiously report out, without 
amendment, H.R. 4482, Protecting Americas 
Food & Agriculture Act of 2019, a bill author-
izing funding to hire additional Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP) personnel needed to 
conduct Agriculture Quarantine Inspection 
at the international ports of entry. The Sen-
ate version of this bill, S. 2107, was recently 
approved by the Senate by unanimous con-
sent. 
The U.S. agriculture sector is a crucial 
component of the American economy, gener-
ating over $1 trillion in annual economic ac-
tivity. According to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, foreign pests and diseases cost 
the American economy tens of billions of 
dollars annually. CBP employees perform 
critically important agricultural inspections 
every day at the nation’s ports of entry. CBP 
Agricultural Specialists play a vital role in 
both trade and travel safety and prevent the 
introduction of harmful foreign animal dis-
eases and exotic plant pests into the U.S. 
Diseases such as African Swine Fever, which 
has killed more than one out of every four 
pigs on the planet, would have a devastating 
impact on U.S. livestock producers, their 
communities, and the economy if introduced 
into the U.S. 
For years, CBP has been chronically under-
staffed at U.S. ports of entry. The most re-
cent results of CBP’s Agriculture Specialist 
Resource Allocation Model (AgRAM) shows a 
need for an additional 721 Agriculture Spe-
cialists. Passage of the Protecting America’s 
Food and Agriculture Act of 2019 would au-
thorize CBP to hire 240 Agriculture Special-
ists and 200 Agriculture Technicians each 
year until the staffing shortage determined 
by AgRAM is remedied. The bill also author-
izes the training and assignment each year 
of 20 new Agricultural Canine Teams, which 
have proven valuable in detecting illicit 
fruits, vegetables, and animal products that 
may have otherwise been missed in initial 
inspections. These specially trained dogs are 
already being utilized by CBP to sniff out po-
tentially contaminated products. Finally, 
the bill authorizes supplemental appropria-
tions each year to pay for the activities of 
agriculture specialists, technicians, and ca-
nine teams. 
We ask Congress to authorize and fund the 
needed CBP Agriculture Specialists, Canine 
Teams, and support staff at the inter-
national ports of entry to guard against na-
tional security threats, address public safety 
risks, and grow the economy. To achieve this 
goal, we urge you to quickly discharge S. 
2107 /H.R. 4482 without amendment and push 
for its swift passage in the House.

Mr. VELA. The U.S. agriculture sec-
tor is crucial to our economy and gen-
erates more than $1 trillion in annual 
economic activity. 
In 2017, Texas farms sold $24.9 billion 
in agricultural products, a significant 
contribution to the State’s economy. 
However, with increasing levels of 
trade, threats to the United States’ ag-
ricultural sector are growing. Foreign 
pests and diseases cost our economy 
tens of billions of dollars per year. 
Agricultural specialists at our ports 
of 
entry 
intercept 
thousands 
of 
invasive pests and prevent the intro-
duction of foreign animal diseases, 
such as the African swine fever, into 
the United States, protecting our nat-
ural resources and our economy. 
Unfortunately, a shortage of agricul-
tural specialists exists at our U.S. 
ports of entry, which is why this legis-
lation is so important. This bill would 
ensure that we have enough agricul-
tural specialists, technicians, and K–9 
teams to adequately perform agricul-
tural quarantine inspections at our 
international ports of entry. 
I ask my colleagues to support swift 
passage of the Protecting America’s 
Food and Agriculture Act of 2019. I 
thank my colleague, Senator PETERS, 
for his collaboration on this crucial 
bill and our Texas colleagues in the 
Senate, Senators CORNYN
and CRUZ, 
and Representative CRENSHAW for their 
leadership in this effort. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. HAGEDORN). 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the Protecting America’s Food and 
Agriculture Act. I think this bill is a 
great example of how the House can 
work 
together, 
particularly 
across 
committee lines. Here, we have Home-
land Security Committee and Agri-
culture Committee folks working to-
gether in the House and the Senate. 
This is a critical piece of legislation 
in order to make sure we do everything 
possible to protect our food supply, our 
farmers, and agribusiness. 
I have been focused very intently on 
this whole African swine fever threat 
for many months. When you look at it 
in China, it has ravaged their hog sup-
ply. Literally, over 50 percent of the 
hogs in China have had to be slaugh-
tered because of it. 
That disease has moved to Thailand, 
Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is in 
Poland, moving toward Germany and 
the European Union. It is an incredible 
threat, and it has caused a lot of de-
struction. 
In my district in southern Min-
nesota, I happen to represent some of 
the finest agricultural producers in all 
the world, including livestock pro-
ducers and many in pork production. 
Our district is number two in the whole 
country for pork production. 
When you look at what is going on 
with African swine fever, it is obvi-
ously both an opportunity and a chal-
lenge. The opportunity is that there is 
going to be a need for our products— 
our pork supply, poultry, and other 
things. Our producers are going to have 
a chance to export around the world, 
perhaps even enhance and expand their 
operations. 
Of course, the challenge is: What hap-
pens if the African swine fever gets in 
the United States? If African swine 
fever enters the United States, it is not 
going to hurt just our pork producers. 
It is going to hurt our corn and soy-
bean growers, and the people who pack 
the meat, transport the meat, all the 
people down the line to Main Street. It 
is going to drive up the prices for our 
consumers, and we can’t let that hap-
pen. 
That is why this bill is so important, 
to enhance the inspectors at these 
ports of entry and to make sure that 
the Beagle Brigades, as they are called, 
are upgraded. They do a terrific job of 
sniffing out the pork. 
I completely support this legislation, 
and I would ask my colleagues to con-
sider this thought in the future, of per-
haps putting together a task force be-
tween the Department of Agriculture 
and the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity to make sure that they are work-
ing in cooperation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota. 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, I 
think a task force would be great, in 
order to make sure that these Depart-
ments are coordinating and working 
together. Then we in the Congress can 
interact with them in a better fashion. 
We have to do every last thing we 
can to protect our food production and 
our American agricultural producers 
from this and other infectious diseases. 
I encourage everyone to support this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Protecting America’s Food and Agriculture Act. 
Agriculture is key to southern Minnesota’s 
economy, but a shortage of Agricultural in-
spectors at America’s ports of entries puts our 
production at risk from infectious diseases. 
African Swine Fever has torn through Chi-
na’s hog population and is currently spreading 
throughout Europe and Asia—with recent out-
breaks reported in the Philippines and Greece. 
Foreign Ag Diseases like the High Path 
Avian Influenza outbreak in 2014 cost the 
poultry industry $1.6 billion. Foreign Ag Dis-
eases affect the whole food supply chain, re-
ducing demand and prices for crops like corn 
and soybeans, and increasing the price of 
food at the supermarket. 
With the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus, 
it is critical that we protect our American food 
and agriculture from pests and foreign-born 
diseases, so that we can continue to supply 
high quality products around the world. 
Our farmers are ready to meet this chal-
lenge. Minnesota’s agriculture exports sky-
rocketed by 263 percent in the past ten years. 
And pork products alone account for 10 per-
cent of all Minnesota Ag exports, therefore an 
outbreak of the ASF would have a significant 
impact on our economy. 
This legislation will help CBP acquire the 
necessary resources to hire, train and assign 
agricultural specialists and support staff for ca-
nine teams that will detect and prevent the 
spread of ASF and other foreign-born dis-
eases at our ports of entry. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in support of this bill in the 
name of protecting our food supply. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
adoption of the bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, agricultural inspectors at 
our ports of entry play a vital role in 
protecting one of the most important 
things there is: the food we eat. 
This bill will help protect every 
American as they sit down at the din-
ner table. I commend my colleagues, 
Congressman 
VELA
and 
Senator 
PETERS, for their work on this impor-
tant bipartisan legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. TORRES SMALL) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
2107. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

pable of producing an image of the contents of 
a commercial or passenger vehicle in one pass of 
such vehicle. 
(2) SCANNING.—The term ‘‘scanning’’ means 
utilizing technology to produce an image of the 
contents of a commercial or passenger vehicle 
without engaging in a physical inspection of 
such vehicle. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. TORRES SMALL) and 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CREN-
SHAW) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legisla-
tive days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5273 aims to im-
prove border security by increasing the 
inspection rate of vehicles entering the 
United States with nonintrusive in-
spection 
systems 
or 
similar 
tech-
nology. 
b 1600 
For years, Customs and Border Pro-
tection has used NII systems to ‘‘see’’ 
inside vehicles for potential contra-
band, such as drugs, without physically 
opening or unloading them. 
This is critical since the majority of 
highly addictive and lethal drugs being 
smuggled into our country are being 
smuggled through our ports of entry, 
not between them. 
According to the 2019 National Drug 
Threat Assessment released by the 
Drug 
Enforcement 
Administration, 
passenger 
vehicles 
and 
commercial 
trucks continue to be the primary 
method used by Mexican transnational 
criminal organizations to traffic drugs 
such as cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl 
into the United States. 
However, CBP currently only scans 
about 15 percent of commercial trucks 
and just 1 percent of passenger vehicles 
with NII systems. 
In fiscal year 2019, Congress provided 
$570 million to CBP to install addi-
tional systems on the southwest bor-
der. 
CBP has indicated that these addi-
tional systems will primarily be in-
stalled at large ports of entry.

CBP expects these additional systems 
to increase NII scanning rates of com-
mercial trucks to 72 percent and pas-
senger vehicles to 40 percent by fiscal 
year 2024. 
While this will undoubtedly improve 
security, it will also increase the risk 
that transnational criminal organiza-
tions will shift their smuggling efforts 
to smaller ports of entry that lack NII 
equipment, such as those in my dis-
trict. 
This is a concern that I raised with 
CBP and port officials during a field 
hearing I held with my colleague, Con-
gressman CRENSHAW, in my district in 
Santa Teresa, New Mexico, last Decem-
ber. 
My legislation aims to ensure that 
all land ports of entry are appro-
priately equipped to combat smug-
gling. 
Specifically, H.R. 5273 requires the 
Secretary of Homeland Security to de-
velop a plan to expeditiously scan 100 
percent of vehicles with NII systems or 
other similar technology at each port 
of entry. 
It will also require the Secretary to 
report annually on the Department’s 
progress implementing the plan until 
100 percent of commercial and pas-
senger vehicles are scanned. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the bipar-
tisan work that went into developing 
this legislation. Specifically, I want to 
thank my colleague, Mr. CRENSHAW, for 
his support on the bill. 
H.R. 5273, if enacted, will help keep 
our communities more secure by ensur-
ing that CBP has the tools in place to 
do a more effective job at interdicting 
dangerous narcotics and dangerous ma-
terials. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 5273, 
the Securing America’s Ports Act. I am 
proud to be an original cosponsor of 
this legislation, and I thank my col-
league from New Mexico for her work 
on this legislation. 
Our ports of entry continue to be a 
preferred 
avenue 
for 
transnational 
criminal organizations and drug smug-
glers to transport narcotics and con-
traband into the United States. 
In fact, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection seized more than 455,000 
pounds of narcotics at our ports in fis-
cal year 2019 alone. 
The amount of fentanyl seized in 2019 
was enough for more than 577 million 
lethal doses. That is more than the en-
tire population of the United States. 
H.R. 5273 forces the Department to 
act on securing the ports of entry by 
requiring the Secretary to develop a 
plan to scan all commercial and pas-
senger vehicles entering the United 
States through land ports using non-
intrusive inspection systems or similar 
systems within 180 days. 
This bill encourages continued re-
search and development, including con-
sideration of emerging technology, to 
meet the inspection system plan re-
quirements. 
H.R. 5273 also requires the Secretary 
to establish benchmarks to evaluate 
progress toward 100 percent scanning, 
estimated costs, anticipated impacts 
on commerce, and anticipated impacts 
on border security operations, includ-
ing staffing considerations. 
Last year, Congress made a signifi-
cant investment in funding nonintru-
sive inspection equipment for imple-
mentation across the land borders over 
a 5-year period, and this bill would en-
sure an appropriate plan is in place so 
that rollout runs smoothly, and tax-
payer dollars are well spent. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers 
and am prepared to close after the gen-
tleman from Texas closes. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
adoption of the bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, again, it is vital that all 
vehicles entering the United States are 
scanned with NII systems or similar 
technology to combat the smuggling of 
drugs and other contraband into the 
country. 
My legislation would help do just 
that by requiring the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to develop a plan to 
achieve 100 percent scanning rate of ve-
hicles at each port of entry and report-
ing on progress annually until that 
goal is achieved. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
on the Committee of Homeland Secu-
rity for their unanimous support to fa-
vorably report my bill to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of 
my colleagues to support H.R. 5273, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. TORRES SMALL) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 5273, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legisla-
tive days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
on the other side of the aisle, Mr. 
BACON, for his leadership on the DHS 
Field Engagement Accountability Act. 
This bill was passed by the House of 
Representatives last January on a 
voice vote. It was also passed unani-
mously by the Senate in July after 
technical edits to the bill text. 
The bill returns to the House floor 
today for us to consider the bill, as 
amended by the Senate, and send it to 
the President. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, once again. 
In the face of an evolving and in-
creasingly complex threat landscape, it 
is critically important to ensure that 
there is collaboration and information 
sharing. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity’s 79 fusion centers, located across 
the country, help to connect the dots 
about possible terrorist plots, includ-
ing domestic terrorist plots. 
A 2016 review found that DHS does 
not have a strategic engagement plan 
for these 79 fusion centers. 
H.R. 504 will help address this gap by 
requiring DHS to develop a Depart-
ment-wide strategy for engaging with 
fusion centers. This includes the devel-
opment of metrics that will help hold 
fusion center staff accountable for 
their performance. 
This legislation also requires DHS to 
improve the classified and unclassified 
information-sharing systems that are 
used by fusion centers to ensure that 
information is shared properly and in 
accordance with Department stand-
ards. 
In part, H.R. 504 would require that 
all information-sharing policies are de-
veloped and maintained by the Depart-
ment’s privacy, civil rights, and civil 
liberties officers. 
Over the past year, as communities 
across the country suffered from acts 
of targeted violence and terrorism, we 
have been reminded of the importance 
of information sharing. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 504, the DHS 
Field Engagement Accountability Act. 
This legislation was introduced by 
my friend and colleague from Ne-
braska, Representative DON BACON. I 
applaud Congressman BACON’s initia-
tive in sponsoring H.R. 504, which re-
quires the Department of Homeland Se-
curity to: 
Develop an engagement strategy for 
the national network of fusion centers; 
Performance metrics for DHS per-
sonnel deployed to support State and 
local fusion centers; and, 
Training for fusion center personnel 
in the use of available DHS informa-
tion-sharing systems. 
Additionally, the bill ensures that 
DHS component agencies are sharing 
appropriate information, through se-
cure channels, with fusion center per-
sonnel. 
Representing a border State, I want 
to ensure that DHS agencies, including 
Customs and Border Protection and 
Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment, have relevant criminal or ter-
rorism information that is accessible 
to appropriate fusion center personnel. 
This will enhance coordination and sit-
uational 
awareness 
throughout 
the 
homeland. 
This bill has already passed the 
House of Representatives and was 
passed in the Senate with minor 
amendments. Passage of the bill today 
will send H.R. 504 to the President’s 
desk. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
again support this legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. BACON). 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleagues and friends from New Mex-
ico and Texas for their leadership 
today and guidance to the floor. 
I rise in support of H.R. 504, the DHS 
Field Engagement Accountability Act, 
which will improve the management, 
integration, transparency, and overall 
mission performance of the 79 State 
and local fusion centers across our 
country. 
Creating a robust and mature infor-
mation-sharing relationship between 
the Department of Homeland Security 
and State and local law enforcement is 
vital for our Homeland Security. 
Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, 
State and local fusion centers have be-
come key stakeholders in the home-
land security of our country, and it is 
an important mission. Yet, despite 
their importance, the Government Ac-
countability Office has observed that a 
lack of standardization in manpower, 
data systems, and training has hurt 
their effectiveness. 
H.R. 504 is focused on setting the con-
ditions to better allow our fusion cen-
ters to accomplish the mission for 
which they were created and funded. 
My home State fusion center, the Ne-
braska Information Analysis Center, or 
NIAC, is the information exchange 
gateway for State, local, and Federal 
authorities serving all of the 93 coun-
ties in Nebraska. 
NIAC collects, analyzes, and shares 
information on crime and terrorism 
with Federal, State, local, and Tribal 
law 
enforcement 
organizations 
and 
with other public and private entities 
as appropriate. 
Recently, the NIAC was called upon 
to collect and analyze reports of sus-
picious drone activity in western Ne-
braska, for example. 
Our Nation’s fusion centers have a 
rapidly expanding range of missions 
that protect our citizens, and the De-
partment of Homeland Security has a 
legal obligation to coordinate with and 
assist these State and local centers. So 
my legislation requires DHS to develop 
an engagement strategy to coordinate 
information sharing, technology, and 
personnel resources with these fusion 
centers. 
Additionally, this bill requires DHS 
to develop clear and robust perform-
ance metrics for Federal personnel as-
signed to these centers. This will help 
both the headquarters and fusion cen-
ter directors improve the effectiveness, 
while ensuring oversight and account-
ability. 
In addition to personnel, DHS also 
provides fusion centers with access to 
classified and sensitive information.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H990 
February 10, 2020 
H.R. 504 calls for improvements in 
training and technology to support this 
vital information exchange, including 
the requirement that DHS share intel-
ligence products with fusion centers 
when appropriate. 
Over the years, Congress has seen a 
vast improvement in DHS’s support for 
these key stakeholders, including the 
NIAC. These improvements are vital to 
DHS sharing timely and relevant infor-
mation with relevant stakeholders on 
the front lines of a constantly evolving 
threat landscape. 
This bill will help those on the front 
lines defend against those who threat-
en or attack our way of life. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
THOMPSON and Ranking Member ROG-
ERS for bringing this bill to the floor. I 
also thank Chairman JOHNSON
and 
Ranking Member PETERS in the Senate 
for moving this bill through the Sen-
ate. 
This is a commonsense measure, and 
with another strong showing of bipar-
tisan support from the House. I look 
forward to the bill quickly becoming 
law. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 504. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers 
and am prepared to close after the gen-
tleman from Texas closes. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I, 
again, want to thank Representative 
BACON for his work on this legislation, 
as well as Chairman THOMPSON, Rank-
ing Member ROGERS, Senator JOHNSON, 
and Senator PETERS for moving this 
bill through the House and Senate 
committees. 
The sharing of counterterrorism and 
other homeland security information 
with State and local officials is vital in 
our efforts to protect the homeland. I 
am proud that we are able to support 
further enhancing these efforts in a bi-
partisan manner today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 504 passed the House 
on voice vote last Friday and passed 
the Senate on voice vote in July after 
technical edits were incorporated into 
the text. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill again so that it can be 
sent to the White House for the Presi-
dent’s signature. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

HOMELAND SECURITY FOR 
CHILDREN ACT 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the 
rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2932) to 
amend the Homeland Security Act of 
2002 to ensure that the needs of chil-
dren are considered in homeland secu-
rity planning, and for other purposes, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. TORRES SMALL) and 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CREN-
SHAW) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legisla-
tive days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 2932, 
the Homeland Security for Children 
Act. 
Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the 
Department of Homeland Security’s 
policies and programs, it is important 
the 
children, 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
among us, are taken into consider-
ation. 
H.R. 2932, introduced by my fellow 
Subcommittee 
Chairman 
DONALD 
PAYNE, would, for the first time, au-
thorize the children’s technical expert 
position within FEMA to ensure the 
needs of children are incorporated in 
all disaster-related activities. 
Importantly, the bill recognizes that, 
when it comes to DHS, the impacts of 
policies and programs go well beyond 
disaster response and recovery. It rec-
ognizes that, from screening protocols 
at TSA checkpoints to short-term de-
tention standards to active-shooter 
training, DHS policy must incorporate 
the needs of children. 
To that end, H.R. 2932 would direct 
the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity’s Under Secretary for Strategy, 
Policy, and Plans to incorporate the 
needs of children in all departmental 
policies, programs, and activities. A 
similar measure passed by voice vote 
in the full House passed last Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time.

COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, January 7, 2020. 
Hon. PETER DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DEFAZIO: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 2932, the ‘‘Home-
land Security for Children Act.’’ The Com-
mittee on Homeland Security recognizes 
that the Committee on Transportation Infra-
structure has a jurisdictional interest in 
H.R. 2932, and I appreciate your effort to 
allow this bill to be considered on the House 
floor. 
I concur with you that forgoing action on 
the bill does not in any way prejudice the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure with respect to its jurisdictional 
prerogatives this bill or similar legislation 
in the future, and I would support your effort 
to seek appointment of an appropriate num-
ber of conferees to any House—Senate con-
ference involving this legislation. 
I will include our letters on H.R. 2932 in the 
Congressional Record during floor consider-
ation of this bill. I look forward to working 
with you on this legislation and other mat-
ters of great importance to this nation. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2932, the Homeland Security for Chil-
dren Act. This legislation seeks to en-
sure that the needs of children, one of 
our most vulnerable populations, are 
considered in Department of Homeland 
Security planning. 
H.R. 2932 directs the Under Secretary 
for Strategy, Policy, and Plans to in-
corporate feedback from children’s or-
ganizations into departmentwide ac-
tivities. 
Furthermore, this bill authorizes the 
technical expert position within the 
Federal Emergency Management Agen-
cy, or FEMA, to identify and integrate 
the needs of children when preparing 
for, protecting against, responding to, 
and recovering from natural and man-
made disasters. 
It is imperative that we ensure that 
those who are unable to advocate for 
themselves are being represented when 
disaster strikes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
join me in supporting this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, children make up near-
ly 23 percent of the Nation’s popu-
lation, and as the threats to our home-
land continue to evolve, it is important 
that we be prepared to adequately as-
sist every child at every age. 
H.R. 2932 directs the Department of 
Homeland Security to include the 
needs of children, the most vulnerable 
among us, in all departmental activi-
ties. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter of support signed by several or-
ganizations representing the needs of 
children, including Save the Children, 
the Child Welfare League of America, 
Share Our Strength, and Zero to Three. 
NATIONAL COALITION ON 
CHILDREN AND DISASTERS, 
Arlington, VA, July 12, 2019. 
Hon. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR., 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN PAYNE: As members of 
the National Coalition on Children and Dis-
asters, which includes organizations that ad-
vocate for the well-being of children and 
their families in the preparation for, re-
sponse to, and recovery from natural or man- 
made disasters, we endorse H.R. 2932, the 
‘‘Homeland Security for Children Act of 
2019.’’ 
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the 
nation learned how unprepared we were at 
the federal, state, and local levels of govern-
ment in addressing and responding to the 
needs of children. As a result, in 2007, Con-
gress established the National Commission 
on Children and Disasters, which produced a 
comprehensive book of recommendations in 
2010. They included improved mental health 
services, pediatric and child welfare needs, 
and 
disaster 
management 
planning, 
re-
sponse, and reunification for child care set-
tings. Most importantly, the Commission 
strongly recommended that improved coordi-
nation of the needs of children among federal 
agencies was needed. 
The Homeland Security for Children Act 
would help improve the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency’s (FEMA) and the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) 
response to the needs of children during dis-
asters. Your bill would also increase ac-
countability across government agencies in 
times of emergency and incorporate feed-
back from youth-serving organizations to 
prioritize and represent the needs of children 
into department-wide policies. In addition, it 
would mandate that DHS provide routine up-
dates to Congress summarizing efforts under-
taken to incorporate the needs of children in 
Department-wide policies, programs, and ac-
tivities. 
With natural disasters on the rise, the 
time is now for Congress to ensure that the 
necessary supports are in place to address 
needs of children and families following dis-
asters. Children are not little adults. They 
have specialized needs that must be consid-
ered when planning for, responding to, and 
recovering from a disaster. 
Thank you for your sponsorship of this 
critical legislation, as well as your ongoing 
leadership on behalf of children and families. 
If we can be of any assistance on advancing 
this bill, please do not hesitate to contact 
us. 
Sincerely, 
National Coalition on Children and Dis-
asters Members include: Child Care 
Aware®
of America; Child Welfare 
League of America; Early Care and 
Education Consortium; First Focus

Child Success; National Center for Dis-
aster Preparedness at Columbia Uni-
versity; 1,000 Days; Partnership for In-
clusive Disaster Strategies; Public Ad-
vocacy for Kids; Save the Children;

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legisla-
tive days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 4737, the Department of Home-
land Security Climate Change Re-
search Act. 
Mr. Speaker, we know that climate 
change is happening, and it is affecting 
every country around the globe. More-
over, we know that climate change is 
leading to increased instability in de-
veloping countries. 
Not only has the Department of De-
fense written about it, Congress ac-
knowledged this in the fiscal year 2018 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
which included in its finding that ‘‘as 
global temperatures rise, droughts and 
famines can lead to more failed states, 
which are breeding grounds of extrem-
ist and terrorist organizations.’’ 
While DOD has researched the impli-
cations of climate change on national 
security, DHS is best positioned to re-
search and respond climate change on 
homeland security. There are already 
reports of extremist groups overseas 
using extreme weather events as a re-
cruitment 
tool, 
targeting 
farmers 
whose crops were lost to drought or 
other weather events. 
As these groups recruit more mem-
bers, gaining strength, the threat they 
pose to homeland security increases. 
DHS must be proactive, not simply re-
active in this threat. 
H.R. 4737 will ensure that DHS is 
using its resources efficiently, evalu-
ating what we already know about cli-
mate change’s effects on homeland se-
curity, and, where practical, devel-
oping tactics to mitigate those effects 
critical to the Department’s mission. 
With this knowledge, the good people 
at DHS will be able to better perform 
their job and keep our country safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time.

myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4737, the Department of Homeland Se-
curity Climate Change Research Act. 
Numerous Federal studies have been 
conducted that summarize the impacts 
of climate change on the United States 
and discuss the nexus between climate 
change and terrorism. 
This bill directs DHS’ Science and 
Technology Directorate to evaluate the 
current Federal research regarding the 
connection between climate change 
and homeland security to identify any 
research gaps and, to the extent prac-
tical, conduct additional research to 
fill those gaps. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage Members to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, effectively combating 
terrorism is a bipartisan issue, and we 
have a duty to our constituents to sup-
port smart legislative proposals. 
Passage of the DHS Climate Change 
Research Act would ensure that the 
Department of Homeland Security is 
proactively addressing and attempting 
to mitigate the risks that climate 
change poses to our homeland security. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for my colleagues 
to support H.R. 4737, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legisla-
tive days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4432, would require 
the Department of Homeland Security 
to take action and address an emerging 
threat to our Nation’s security, the 
threat posed by unmanned aerial sys-
tems, or drones, to critical infrastruc-
ture. 
Drone technology is far from new. 
However, as technology evolves, so do 
the capabilities of bad actors who may 
want to cause harm to the people of 
this country. We know the drones can 
be weaponized and used to carry out 
terrorist attacks, particularly on vul-
nerable, critical infrastructure. Earlier 
this fall, drones struck Saudi Arabian 
crude oil infrastructure, disrupting the 
production of 5.7 million barrels of oil 
per day and causing a spike in oil 
prices around the world. 
In an evolving threat environment, 
understanding the threats that drones 
present to critical infrastructure here 
in the United States is critical to miti-
gating those threats. 
Critical infrastructure owners and 
operators recognize the benefits of 
drone technology; many even put them 
to good use in their own businesses. 
Nevertheless, they do have concerns 
about the threats that unauthorized 
drones may pose to their facilities. 
Currently, when a drone is detected 
in a facility’s airspace, there is no DHS 
official agency to call. At the very 
least, owners and operators should be 
able to report unauthorized drone ac-
tivity when they detect it. 
H.R. 4432 would allow for information 
sharing between critical infrastructure 
owners and operators and DHS in sev-
eral ways: 
First, it would require DHS to estab-
lish a channel for the voluntary report-
ing information on drones, as well as 
other emerging threats, over a secure 
communications infrastructure devel-
oped in conjunction with the Depart-
ment’s Chief Information Officer. 
Additionally, H.R. 4432, would man-
date that the DHS’ Under Secretary for 
Intelligence and Analysis develop and 
disseminate a threat assessment on un-
manned 
aerial 
systems 
and 
other 
emerging threats associated with drone 
technology. 
This 
assessment 
would 
consider threat intelligence from Fed-
eral, State, local, and private-sector 
partners and would be prepared in con-
sultation with other DHS components, 
like the Cybersecurity and Infrastruc-
ture Security Agency, that have rel-
evant expertise. 
Finally, H.R. 4432 would require DHS 
to report its findings to Congress with-
in 1 year. 
Collectively, this bill would require 
DHS to take the lead on understanding 
the threat that drones present to this 
Nation’s critical infrastructure, while 
also creating an enduring mechanism 
for DHS to gather information on 
emerging threats, as they arise, from 
the owners and operators who stand on 
the front line of our defense. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4432, the Protecting Critical Infrastruc-
ture Against Drones and Emerging 
Threats Act. 
In the wrong hands, unmanned aerial 
systems can pose a threat to the Amer-
ican people. At our borders, criminals 
are using drones to smuggle drugs and 
surveil law enforcement. Terrorists 
like ISIS have used them in the past to 
carry out attacks overseas. 
We must do more to address this 
threat, and with this bill we do just 
that. H.R. 4432 protects the American 
people from the threat posed by these 
criminal drone operators. 
b 1630 
This legislation requires the Under 
Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis 
at DHS to prepare an assessment of the 
threat from drones with information 
gathered from Federal, State, local, 
and private-sector partners. 
This bill also requires DHS to estab-
lish a secure communications network 
to receive and analyze information on 
the threat and a voluntary mechanism 
for reporting threat information from 
owners and operators of critical infra-
structure. 
During committee consideration of 
this bill, I proposed an amendment to 
allow DHS to produce this information 
in a classified form, as appropriate. I 
am pleased that language was included 
in this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill 
that will position DHS to address the 
threat that drones pose to critical in-
frastructure. This measure was pre-
viously introduced by my colleague

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4753 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

States; 
(2) for counter-UAS surrogate testing and 
training; or 
(3) for intelligence, electronic warfare, or 
information 
warfare 
operations, 
testing, 
analysis, and or training. 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) COVERED FOREIGN COUNTRY.—The term 
‘‘covered foreign country’’ means a country 
labeled as a strategic competitor in the 
‘‘Summary of the 2018 National Defense 
Strategy of the United States of America: 
Sharpening the American Military’s Com-
petitive Edge’’ issued by the Department of 
Defense pursuant to section 113 of title 10, 
United States Code. 
(2) COVERED UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM.— 
The term ‘‘unmanned aircraft system’’ has 
the meaning given such term in section 331 
of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 
2012 (Public Law 112–95; 49 U.S.C. 44802 note). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. TORRES SMALL) and 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CREN-
SHAW) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legisla-
tive days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank 
my colleague, Congressman CRENSHAW, 
for introducing this important legisla-
tion. 
To help carry out its many missions, 
the Department of Homeland Security, 
DHS, relies on drones to improve situa-
tional awareness. Drones can be used 
to survey damage from natural disas-
ters or monitor remote locations along 
the border, including in my district. If 
data collected by a DHS drone was to 
be stolen by a foreign government, it 
could jeopardize the national or home-
land security. 
Recent reports suggest that Chinese- 
manufactured drones, otherwise known 
as unmanned aircraft systems, in the 
American 
market 
might 
be 
com-
promised and used to send sensitive in-
formation to the Chinese Government. 
In response to these cybersecurity con-
cerns, the Department of the Interior 
recently grounded all of its foreign- 
made 
drones. 
The 
DOD 
similarly 
banned the purchase and use of all 
commercial off-the-shelf drones, except 
under limited circumstances. 
It is time for the DHS to take similar 
protective measures. H.R. 4753 would 
prohibit DHS from purchasing or using 
drone technology manufactured in cer-
tain foreign countries designated as 
strategic competitors by the National 
Defense Strategy. The legislation per-
mits the use of such drone technology 
only when DHS notifies Congress that 
the technology is being used in a lim-
ited manner, such as counter-drone 
testing and training. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of this bipartisan bill, grateful to 
have joined Congressman CRENSHAW on 
this initiative, and pleased that it was 
reported out of committee by unani-
mous consent. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Department of 
Homeland Security is charged with 
protecting Americans here at home, 
and it is critical that the technologies 
used to carry out this mission are se-
cure. The risk posed by certain foreign 
drone manufacturers is well docu-
mented and presents a national secu-
rity threat. 
Chinese-manufactured drones could 
provide a backdoor for the Chinese 
Government to access sensitive flight 
data from drones used by DHS. My bill, 
H.R. 4753, seeks to address this vulnera-
bility. 
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency has stated that these 
unmanned aircraft systems are a po-
tential risk to an organization’s infor-
mation and that drones could contain 
components that could compromise 
your data. 
The potential for comprised data to 
fall into the hands of a foreign govern-
ment 
should 
concern 
everyone. 
It 
threatens to disrupt the law enforce-
ment and national security objectives 
of DHS. 
My bill, the Drone Origin Security 
Enhancement Act, addresses the threat 
by prohibiting DHS from acquiring un-
manned aircraft systems manufactured 
in a foreign country labeled a strategic 
competitor by the Department of De-
fense. This is similar to a prohibition 
included in the National Defense Au-
thorization Act of 2019 for the military. 
Simply put, my bill will ensure that 
DHS is not using drone equipment from 
a foreign government that our military 
already views as a threat. 
Much like the Department of De-
fense, DHS and its components have a 
critical mission. The risk introduced 
into these missions by foreign-manu-
factured drones is not something that 
can be ignored. This legislation ad-
dresses this very real threat and will 
keep our adversaries from compro-
mising the technology we use to keep 
Americans safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
league from New Mexico for her leader-
ship on this bill. I urge my colleagues 
to pass H.R. 4753, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4753 takes the much- 
needed step of protecting the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security from cy-
bersecurity threats associated with 
certain foreign-made drones. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. TORRES SMALL) that the House

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. TORRES SMALL) and 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CREN-
SHAW) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legisla-
tive days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Department of 
Homeland Security, DHS, invests bil-
lions of dollars in major acquisition 
programs annually to execute its crit-
ical missions. These programs acquire 
systems vital to homeland security, in-
cluding ships for the U.S. Coast Guard 
and baggage screening systems for the 
Transportation Security Administra-
tion. 
However, the Government Account-
ability Office and the DHS Office of In-
spector General have reported on the 
longstanding challenges DHS faces in 
managing its major acquisitions pro-
gram. Although DHS has taken steps 
to improve acquisition management, 
DHS struggles to ensure that major ac-
quisition 
programs 
cost 
what 
was 
originally estimated, are delivered on 
schedule, and provide the capabilities 
originally intended. 
H.R. 3413 clarifies responsibilities for 
acquisition 
management 
activities 
within DHS to ensure that major ac-
quisition programs have the appro-
priate support and oversight needed to 
succeed. It will also improve account-
ability when major acquisition pro-
grams do not perform as well as in-
tended. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Con-
gressman CRENSHAW
for yet another 
important DHS bill. I urge my House 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Department of 
Homeland Security is tasked with 
some of the most critical national se-
curity functions in the Federal Govern-
ment. The Department is responsible 
for securing our borders, defending our 
cyber networks, safeguarding air trav-
el, and protecting our ports. To carry 
out these important missions, it is im-
perative that DHS acquire the proper 
tools and equipment and maintain 
proper oversight of such acquisitions. 
Both the Government Accountability 
Office and the DHS Office of Inspector 
General have reported on the per-
sistent challenges that DHS has faced 
for years in managing its major acqui-
sition 
programs. 
The 
Department’s 
shortcomings in the management of 
these programs come with a hefty price 
tag for American taxpayers, to the 
tune of billions of dollars annually. 
GAO reviewed acquisitions at DHS in 
2016 and found that 8 of 25 major acqui-
sition programs experienced cost over-
runs, schedule slips, or both. On aver-
age, these programs’ cost estimates 
ballooned by $1.7 billion, and the key 
deadlines were missed by almost a 
year. Only 3 out of 25 major acquisition 
programs were on track to meet their 
original schedule and cost goals. 
GAO has also found that DHS compo-
nents have not implemented acquisi-
tion policy consistently. In 2012, GAO 
determined that only 4 out of 66 pro-
grams had all the required documents 
approved in accordance with DHS pol-
icy, and in 2015, GAO determined that 
DHS did not conduct needed oper-
ational testing on all acquisition pro-
grams. 
Although DHS has taken steps in re-
cent years to improve acquisition man-
agement, this process remains ripe for 
waste, fraud, and abuse. The Depart-
ment continues to struggle to ensure 
that major acquisition programs ad-
here to their budgets, timelines, and 
capability goals. 
To be clear, it is taxpayers who are 
on the hook for all of this. We must re-
member that every inefficiency in gov-
ernment spending results in an addi-
tional financial burden that must be 
covered by the citizens of this country. 
As egregious as the cost overruns 
may be, the consequences of not pro-
viding the proper tools on time are 
even more dire. If DHS cannot provide 
proper oversight of its major acquisi-
tion programs, then the Department 
cannot provide the tools they need to 
execute their missions to keep Ameri-
cans safe. 
This bill goes a long way to correct 
some of the current shortfalls in the 
acquisition process, which will help en-
sure we are being responsible stewards 
of taxpayer dollars and protecting the 
integrity of these programs. It gives 
new authority over these billion-dollar 
programs to the Under Secretary for 
Management as the Chief Acquisition 
Officer. It fosters more thoughtful 
management of major acquisition pro-
grams using private-sector best prac-
tices and bolsters oversight and ac-
countability measures. 
These changes will help move the 
necessary tools into the hands of those 
protecting our homeland in a timely 
and efficient manner without foisting a 
financial burden on Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3413 is necessary to 
provide robust oversight of major ac-
quisition programs to help ensure that 
these programs meet cost, schedule, 
and performance goals, and that tax-
payer money is not wasted. 
A previous version of this bill passed 
the House in the 115th Congress by a 
vote of 407–1. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to, 
once again, pass this important legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. TORRES SMALL) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 3413, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas

The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE 
PRESIDENT—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–92) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Appropriations 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Over the past 3 years, my Adminis-
tration has worked tirelessly to restore 
America’s economic strength. We have 
ended the war on American workers 
and stopped the assault on American 
industry, launching an economic boom 
the likes of which we have never seen 
before. 
While our incredible economic turn-
around came as a shock to most career

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H998 
February 10, 2020 
politicians in Washington, it is no sur-
prise to millions of hard-working fami-
lies across the Nation. Their natural 
talent, ingenuity, and strength simply 
needed an opportunity to flourish, free 
from the massive regulations and taxes 
heaped upon them by their Govern-
ment. 
As my Administration continues to 
remove these burdens, our economy 
continues to surpass expectations. We 
are growing faster than the experts 
thought possible. The unemployment 
rate is at 3.5 percent, the lowest it has 
been in 50 years. And more Americans 
are working today than at any point in 
our history. 
Today’s tremendous job market is 
leading employers to realize the vast 
potential of many individuals they pre-
viously overlooked. Over the past 3 
years, the employment rate of our 
prime-age workers has skyrocketed, 
and wages are growing the fastest for 
historically disadvantaged workers, re-
versing trends under the previous ad-
ministration. 
With this 2021 Budget, my Adminis-
tration is placing a special focus on 
these forgotten Americans, because 
every individual deserves to experience 
the dignity that comes through work. 
The truth is, jobs do not just provide 
paychecks: they give people purpose; 
allow them to engage with their com-
munities; and help them reach their 
true potential. As we have shown, the 
right policies offer Americans paths to 
independence 
rather 
than 
trapping 
them in reliance on Government pro-
grams. 
The era of putting American workers 
second and doubling down on the failed 
policies of the past is over. While job 
creation during my Presidency has sur-
passed expectations, the credit belongs 
to the job creators and workers who 
risk everything and devote themselves 
to building a better future for them-
selves, their families, and their Nation. 
The Federal Government does not cre-
ate jobs; hardworking Americans cre-
ate jobs. My Administration’s role is to 
follow our foundational policy pillars 
and allow our job creators and workers 
to do what they do best. 
To ensure this economic strength 
continues, I have called on the Govern-
ment to reduce wasteful, unnecessary 
spending, and to fix mismanagement 
and redundancy across agencies. This 
includes prioritizing spending for pro-
grams that are a core function of the 
United States Government. 
As we enter the 2020’s, our Nation 
confronts new challenges and opportu-
nities. The 21st century requires us to 
focus on great power rivals; prioritize 
artificial intelligence, 5G, and indus-
tries of the future; and to protect our 
research and environment from foreign 
government influence. To meet these 
challenges and seize these opportuni-
ties, we must shift the Government out 
of its old and outdated ways. This will 
require each and every Government 
agency to do more to prepare for the 
demands of tomorrow. 
The following are key priorities of 
my Administration: 
Better Trade Deals. Renegotiated or 
new trade deals with Canada and Mex-
ico, China, South Korea, and Japan are 
modernizing international trade and 
creating freer, fairer, and more recip-
rocal trade between the United States 
and our largest economic partners. 
These deals will enable our country’s 
manufacturing 
renaissance 
to 
con-
tinue. Trade deals are in development 
with the United Kingdom and the Eu-
ropean Union, as well as other coun-
tries that desire access to the coveted 
American market. These deals will ex-
pand American markets abroad and 
keep businesses here in America, which 
means keeping jobs here at home. 
Preserving Peace through Strength. 
To sustain security at home and pro-
mote American interests abroad, my 
Administration has rebuilt the mili-
tary. A strong military, fully equipped 
and integrated with our allies and all 
our instruments of power, enables our 
Nation to deter war, preserve peace, 
and, if necessary, defeat aggression 
against the United States and her peo-
ple. To that end, my Budget requests 
$740.5 billion for national defense. 
Overcoming the Opioid Crisis. Be-
cause of my Administration’s aggres-
sive tactics to fight over-prescription 
of opioids, promote effective treatment 
for addiction, and secure the border, we 
are turning the tide of the opioid crisis. 
Since my term began, we have seen a 
more than 30 percent decrease in the 
total amount of opioids prescribed, and 
deaths from drug overdose fell for the 
first time in nearly 30 years in 2018. 
Failure is not an option when it 
comes to helping people avoid the pain, 
suffering, and death caused by addic-
tion. Work must play an integral role 
in any solution. Research shows that 
holding a job is a key factor in helping 
people overcome drug addiction. For 
the duration of my Presidency, I will 
continue to promote policies that will 
beat back this deadly crisis and pro-
mote job training and employment op-
portunities for Americans who are re-
building their lives after struggling 
with addiction. 
Regulation Relief. Many pundits and 
Washington insiders laughed when I 
promised to cut two regulations for 
every new regulation. They were cor-
rect that two-for-one was the wrong 
goal. Instead, the Federal Government 
has cut more than seven regulations 
for every significant new regulation. 
After only 3 years, my Administration 
has cut a historic number of regula-
tions, and we have put the brakes on an 
endless assault of new, costly actions 
by Federal agencies. 
Our commitment to regulatory re-
form stems from the simple truth that 
the vast majority of business owners 
want to do the right thing, comply 
with the law, and treat their workers 
fairly. The Federal Government ig-
nored this reality for far too long and 
abused its authority to go after busi-
nesses, especially small businesses and 
entrepreneurs, in ways that can only 
be described as arbitrary and abusive. 
At the same time, we are maintain-
ing America’s world-class standards of 
environmental protection. Emissions 
of all criteria pollutants dropped be-
tween 2016 and 2018. The United States 
environmental record is one of the 
strongest in the world and continues to 
have some of the cleanest air and water 
in the world. 
American 
Energy 
Independence. 
American energy powers our cities and 
towns, empowers innovators, drives our 
economy, and protects our sovereignty. 
Energy companies across the world are 
ready to build in our Nation, and per-
mitting reform that cuts red tape 
shows that we welcome their invest-
ments. My Administration continues 
to support growth in the energy sector 
by removing unnecessary regulations 
and unleashing America’s vast natural 
and human resources. Through these 
actions, the United States is now on 
track to be a net exporter of crude oil 
and natural gas for all of 2020, a major 
milestone not achieved in nearly 70 
years. In addition to being the world’s 
largest natural gas producer, we also 
became the World’s top crude oil pro-
ducer in 2018. 
The records of our energy boom are 
widespread. Energy production has cre-
ated jobs in areas of the United States 
where job opportunities were scarce. It 
also provides enormous benefits to 
families across the Nation by lowering 
energy prices. And it further distances 
us from geopolitical foes who wish to 
cause us harm. More jobs, lower costs, 
and American dominance—these are 
predictable results of our pro-energy 
policies. 
Today, there is hope throughout 
America. There is optimism that was 
not here before 63 million Americans 
asked me to work for them and drain 
the swamp. For decades, Washington 
elites told us that Americans had no 
choice but to accept stagnation, decay, 
and decline. 
We proved them wrong. Our economy 
is strong once more, and America’s role 
as leader of the Free World has been re-
stored. 
America is the single greatest coun-
try in the world. We must never believe 
for one moment that this great Nation 
is destined for a diminished future. 
When we take hold of our freedom, and 
take our destiny in our hands, we 
choose to reject a future of American 
decline. My 2021 Budget sets the course 
for a future of continued American 
dominance and prosperity.

ALTERNATIVE PLAN FOR PAY AD-
JUSTMENTS FOR CIVILIAN FED-
ERAL EMPLOYEES COVERED BY 
GENERAL SCHEDULE AND OTHER 
PAY SYSTEMS IN JANUARY 2021— 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. 
NO. 116–97) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and referred to 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
I am transmitting an alternative 
plan for pay adjustments for civilian 
Federal employees covered by the Gen-
eral Schedule and certain other pay 
systems in January 2021. 
Title 5, United States Code, author-
izes me to implement alternative plans 
for pay adjustments for civilian Fed-
eral employees covered by the General 
Schedule and certain other pay sys-
tems if, because of ‘‘national emer-
gency or serious economic conditions 
affecting the general welfare,’’ I view 
the increases that would otherwise 
take effect as inappropriate. 
Under current law, locality pay in-
creases averaging 20.67 percent, costing 
$21 billion in the first year alone, 
would go into effect in January 2021, in 
addition to a 2.5 percent across-the- 
board increase for the base General 
Schedule. 
We must maintain efforts to put our 
Nation on a fiscally sustainable course; 
Federal agency budgets cannot sustain 
such increases. Accordingly, I have de-
termined that it is appropriate to exer-
cise my authority to set alternative 
pay adjustments for 2021 pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 5303(b) and 5 U.S.C. 5304a. 
Specifically, I have determined that 
for 2021 the across-the-board base pay 
increase will be limited to 1.0 percent 
and locality pay percentages will re-
main at their 2020 levels. This alter-
native pay plan decision will not mate-
rially affect our ability to attract and 
retain a well-qualified Federal work-
force. 
As noted in my Budget for Fiscal 
Year 2021, our pay system must reform 
to align with mission-critical recruit-
ment and retention goals, and to re-
ward employees whose performance 
provides value for the American peo-
ple. For this purpose, my Budget fur-
ther 
directs 
agencies 
to 
increase 
awards spending in FY 2021 by an 
amount equal to no less than 1 percent 
of total salary spending. My Adminis-
tration will continue to support re-
forms that advance these aims. 
The adjustment described above shall 
take effect on the first day of the first 
applicable pay period beginning on or 
after January 1, 2021.

Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I ask

objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection.

PUERTO RICO’S ONGOING CRISIS 
THAT DEMANDS AN IMMEDIATE 
AND ROBUST RESPONSE 
(Mr. CRIST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of our ailing fellow Americans 
in Puerto Rico as they recover from 
the devastating earthquakes that hit 
the island this past month. 
For weeks, we have heard horror sto-
ries from my constituents in the Puer-
to Rican communities about what they 
are seeing and hearing from their 
friends and families on the island: 
homes reduced to rubble; families liv-
ing in flooded camps; children sleeping 
on the streets; and the earthquakes 
keep coming, one as recently as 2 days 
ago. 
This is an ongoing crisis that de-
mands an immediate and robust re-
sponse. But right now, we are seeing 
critical aid delayed. 
We in Florida know that, when we 
politicize disaster relief, we put peo-
ple’s lives at stake. The House passed a 
supplemental relief bill Friday. Now it 
is time for the Senate to act for our 
Puerto Rican brothers and sisters.

RECOGNIZING 
UNIVERSITY 
OF 
PITTSBURGH-JOHNSTOWN WRES-
TLING COACH PAT PECORA 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to con-
gratulate the University of Pittsburgh- 
Johnstown 
wrestling 
coach, 
Pat 
Pecora, on his recent record-breaking 
meet. 
On Friday, February 7, Coach Pecora 
led the Panthers to victory with a 22– 
12 win over Mercyhurst. This win was 
Pecora’s 617th, and it snapped nearly a 
five-decade-long record for most wins 
in college wrestling at any level or di-
vision. Pat Pecora has led his team to 
two Division II national championships 
over the years, as well as 22 NCAA re-
gional titles. 
Coach Pecora’s commitment to the 
sport has not gone unnoticed. He has 
been named Coach of the Year by the 
National Wrestling Coaches Associa-
tion three times, most recently in 2019. 
Pennsylvania is a national leader in 
wrestling. It is a passion that is woven 
throughout the Commonwealth’s his-
tory. Coach Pecora’s leadership and 
coaching record at Pitt-Johnstown is 
one to be proud of. 
Congratulations, Coach, on this fan-
tastic achievement. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL CAREER 
AND 
TECHNICAL 
EDUCATION 
MONTH 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, as 
co-chair of the Career and Technical 
Education Caucus, I rise to recognize 
National CTE Month. 
CTE programs, like those at the Gen-
esis Center in my home State of Rhode 
Island, show the promise of economic 
opportunities for CTE students of all 
ages. 
Cindy’s story is a great example. She 
was unemployed when she enrolled in 
the Genesis Center’s Pharmacy Techni-
cian Pre-Apprenticeship Program at 
CVS, and before she completed her 
training, Cindy was offered a job. She 
then went on to get her Pharmacy 2 
certificate, and she currently holds a 
full-time 
position 
in 
the 
Lifespan 
Health System. 
Cindy’s story is just one of many 
CTE successes, and I am so proud to 
honor her and the millions of other 
students and educators this month. 
Madam Speaker, I am also pleased to 
recognize my good friend and CTE Cau-
cus co-chair, GT THOMPSON, for his 
leadership in advancing CTE policy in 
Congress. GT’s partnership has been 
absolutely invaluable, and I look for-
ward to continuing our work together 
this month and beyond.

b 1915 
RECOGNIZING CLARENCE FORT 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate Black 
History Month. This month is designed 
to celebrate the achievements of Afri-
can Americans and the significant role 
that they have played in our Nation’s 
history. 
The State of Florida is home to one 
such 
leader, 
Hillsborough 
County’s 
Clarence Fort. Mr. Fort organized and 
participated in Tampa’s first lunch 
counter sit-in in the downtown Wool-
worth’s department store. After a week 
of nonviolent sit-ins, Tampa’s mayor 
appointed a biracial committee to dis-
cuss segregation. By September 1960, 
the city’s lunch counters were inte-
grated. 
Mr. Fort also led the initiative to in-
tegrate the workforce of Tampa Tran-
sit Lines and later went on to serve 20 
years as a Hillsborough County sher-
iff’s deputy. 
Strong men and women like Clarence 
Fort persevered during some of Amer-
ica’s most divided periods. His strength 
and courage are part of what makes 
our Nation great. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all the 
brave African Americans whose posi-
tive influence and impact inspire us 
this month and every month of the 
year. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF JOE VANDEVER, SR. 
(Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and the 
legacy of Joe Vandever, Sr., who passed 
away recently at the age of 96. 
Joe was a Navajo native code talker, 
a member of an elite group that used 
their native tongue to create unbreak-
able codes and transmit top-secret 
messages during World War II. 
Joe bravely enlisted with the U.S. 
Marine Corps at the age of 20 and 
served in nine different locations until 
he was honorably discharged as a cor-
poral in 1946. 
Here is a great part of his story, be-
sides all the work he did for our mili-
tary. Joe is survived by his sister, his 
six children, 36 grandchildren, 55 great- 
grandchildren, and one great-great- 
grandchild. 
We must never forget the immense 
bravery and sacrifices made by the 
Navajo code talkers. They saved count-
less lives and helped turn the tide of 
World War II. 
Pat and I are keeping Joe’s family 
and friends and the entire Navajo Na-
tion community in our prayers as we 
mourn his passing. 
There are very few code talkers left 
in our country today. I have gotten to 
know most of them, and it has been a 
great honor. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CAREER AND 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize February as Ca-
reer and Technical Education Month. 
Our education system should always 
be tailored to prepare all students, not 
just those attending a 4-year college. 
CTE programs ensure graduates have 
the vocational and technical skills nec-
essary to succeed in the future. In fact, 
there are 30 million jobs in the United 
States that pay an average of $55,000 
per year that don’t require bachelor’s 
degrees. 
The U.S. Department of Education 
estimates there will be 68 percent more 
job openings for transportation occupa-
tional careers in the next 5 years than 
there are people training to fill those 
jobs. With opportunities like these, 
students shouldn’t feel forced to attend 
one type of institution over another.

CONGRESS MUST PROTECT 
COMMUNITIES ACROSS NATION 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
in the dark of night in January 2020, 
my 
constituents 
near 
the 
Watson 
Grinding and Manufacturing Company 
were awakened by a catastrophic ex-
plosion around 4 a.m. in the morning. 
Unbeknownst to these working fami-
lies, 
this 
particular 
manufacturing 
building had propylene, and there was 
a leak, and there was a seismic explo-
sion. 
Four hundred homes have been dam-
aged to the extent that people cannot 
return. Tragically, two employees were 
killed. Due to the fact that the shift 
had not started, there wasn’t a cata-
strophic killing of employees, innocent 
employees. A truck was blown from 
one part of the street to the other. 
We now cannot find the owner of this 
particular company. Homes are still 
destroyed. Businesses are destroyed. 
There is no one to call. 
I will be introducing legislation that 
insists that companies have the respon-
sibility to report to local jurisdictions 
the dangerous flammable and toxic ma-
terials that they are holding. 
We are still fighting to get relief for 
these innocent victims, and we are ask-
ing Mr. Watson to stand up and do 
what he said he would, which is to take 
care of all of these persons. Well, he is 
doing it by filing bankruptcy. 
We will not rest until all of these 
homes and homeowners find a way for 
relief. I ask Members to join me in the 
legislation that will protect commu-
nities across the Nation. 
f 
RECOGNIZING ARTHUR PARKER 
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, upon 
his 
well-deserved 
retirement 
this 
month, I rise today to recognize Plano 
police officer Art Parker on his 34 
years of dedicated service to the city of 
Plano, Texas. 
During his tenure as a school re-
source officer, Art made headlines for 
his incredible ability to memorize the 
names of over 20,000 students. 
A true public servant and a man of 
many talents, Officer Parker was often 
seen playing extravagant harmonica 
solos, making balloon animals, and, 
most 
impressively, 
making 
people 
laugh from their cars while stuck in 
school traffic. 
In 2015, Officer Parker was the first 
ever school resource officer to be 
named Plano Officer of the Year. This 
came as no surprise to so many in-
spired by his power to make others feel 
valued. 
Officer Parker has made a lasting im-
pact on the Plano community. Al-
though he will be missed, we know his 
future has wonderful things in store for 
him. I ask my colleagues in the House 
to join me in congratulating Officer 
Art Parker on his successful career and 
wishing him luck as he begins his next 
chapter.

PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, this is 
Damon Clayton, the son of my dear 
friend, Dearborn Heights City Council-
woman Lisa Hicks-Clayton. Today, I 
rise in honor of his precious life. 
Thirteenth 
District 
Strong 
lost 
Damon to suicide last week at the 
young age of 28. 
One friend wrote: ‘‘This man was a 
friend and a brother to me. We may not 
have shared DNA, but we shared a com-
mon desire to protect.’’ He was a U.S. 
Army paratrooper in Afghanistan and a 
firefighter/EMT for the city of Ecorse. 
‘‘When we lost Damon, we lost a very 
special blessing from God. This special 
soul spent his life protecting us.’’ 
He said: ‘‘I finish my EMT school in 
3 weeks. I would like to finish in honor 
of him. Damon was a factor in my 
choice to pursue public safety. I want 
him to always be remembered.’’ 
For me, Damon was dearly loved by 
so many people, including his parents 
and his siblings. 
Death by suicide among veterans rep-
resents a public health crisis in our 
country. In 2005, over 5,700 veterans 
died by suicide, a number that rose to 
over 6,100 in 2017. 
In Damon’s memory, I promise to do 
everything in my power to get our vet-
erans the healthcare and help that 
they deserve.

HONORING DR. JIM FARHA 
(Mr. ESTES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in honoring 
the life of Dr. S. Jim Farha. 
On January 17, 2020, Dr. Farha passed 
away, leaving behind family, friends, 
and a legacy of making Wichita and 
our State a better place. 
After leaving his native Lebanon in 
search of an opportunity in America, 
Dr. Farha worked hard to become a 
cardiothoracic surgeon. In 1963, Dr. 
Farha and his brother George began a 
surgical practice in Wichita to meet a 
critical need of surgeons in the region. 
Over time, the practice would eventu-
ally become the largest of its kind in 
the State of Kansas. 
In addition to leading the practice 
for nearly 40 years with his brother, Dr. 
Farha also worked tirelessly to im-
prove our community. From landmarks 
like the Wichita Art Museum to the 
YMCA, the philanthropy and service of 
Dr. Farha and his late wife, Darla, can 
be seen throughout Wichita and our re-
gion. 
His dedication to serving others, 
whether in the operating room or in 
the community, has left an inspiring 
imprint, which will be felt for genera-
tions. Dr. Farha’s life is a true testa-
ment to the American Dream, and he 
will be missed.

CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF 
SUFFRAGE 
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, 100 
years ago, the great State of New Jer-
sey became the 29th State to ratify the 
19th Amendment guaranteeing women 
the right to vote. 
New Jerseyans of all ages are hon-
oring this anniversary. On Sunday, the 
Kinnelon Girl Scouts held a women’s 
vote celebration, inviting residents to 
learn about the suffrage movement and 
what it means today. 
In towns across my district, like 
Morris Township, the municipal build-
ing will be lit purple this week, a nod 
to the purple of the suffragette sashes 
that symbolized dignity and loyalty. 
I thank all our residents for recog-
nizing this milestone and what it 
means in 2020. 
New Jersey’s most influential suf-
fragette, Alice Paul, started the Na-
tional Woman’s Party. She said some-
thing 
that 
still 
resonates 
today: 
‘‘There’s nothing complicated about or-
dinary equality.’’ 
In our complicated world, women 
have made significant strides since 
1920. As we celebrate 100 years of suf-
frage, let us remember all the work 
that lies ahead. 
f 
HONORING CHASE TOWNSEND 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I love 
to listen to music, modern country like 
Kenny Chesney, classic country like 
Johnny Cash, ‘90s grunge like Pearl 
Jam, and ‘80s rock like The Who with 
Pete Townshend doing windmills. 
But there is another Townsend that 
does more than Pete to keep music 
alive. This past Saturday, I dropped by 
to meet Chase Townsend and to thank 
him for creating jobs. He runs The 
Music Factory in Pearland, Texas. 
That small business was started 50 
years ago by his dad, Steve. I was over-
whelmed by the guitars, ukuleles, cel-
los, keyboards, and drums. 
I asked him: Why do you do this? 
What keeps you going?

HONORING MAYOR RICH PALOMBO 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
honor Richard Palombo for an amazing 
20 years of service as mayor of Upper 
Township in South Jersey. 
Rich exemplifies leadership in his 
personal and his professional life. 
His gentle leadership is welcome at a 
time, unfortunately, when we have bit-
ter partisanship. I know firsthand of 
his ability after working with him for 
years in his capacity as mayor. 
Rich listens to every side and makes 
informed decisions which are driven by 
his desire to have the best community 
possible, whether Republican or Demo-
crat. 
At any given time of year, 1,500 to 
2,000 student-age children will be par-
ticipating in sporting events at the 
area’s sports complexes, this is thanks 
to the leadership of Rich Palombo. I 
know how proud he is, and should be, of 
this accomplishment. 
Mayor Palombo has kept taxes and 
crime low without sacrificing services, 
and I know his community always 
thanks him for that. 
Congratulations, Rich. I look forward 
to our continuing relationship. And 
thank you for all that you do for our 
great community and the communities 
around you. 
May God always bless you, and the 
best of luck for the future.

150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RATI-
FICATION OF THE 15TH AMEND-
MENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
WEXTON). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman 
from 
Nevada 
(Mr. 
HORSFORD) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks on the 
subject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Nevada? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to anchor the Congres-
sional Black Caucus’ Special Order 
hour, and I thank our chairwoman, 
Congresswoman KAREN BASS, for her 
tremendous leadership in organizing 
this effort. 
Tonight, we are marking the 150th 
anniversary of the ratification of the 
15th Amendment, which prohibits the 
Federal Government and each State 
from denying a citizen the right to 
vote based on that citizen’s race, color, 
or previous condition of servitude. 
In the aftermath of the ratification 
of the 15th Amendment, well over 2,000 
Black men were elected to local, State, 
and Federal offices, 16 of whom served 
in Congress. Those elected officials 
were able to stand up for their commu-
nities and to work for the resources 
and protections they needed. 
Today, the members of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus are continuing 
their legacy. So tonight, we have a 
number of Members who will speak on 
both the importance of the 150th anni-
versary of the 15th Amendment as well 
as the present dangers that exist in 
this body and the issues that we are 
continuing to address. 
Today, we also received the Presi-
dent’s budget. Every year, the Presi-
dent’s budget shows that he does not 
reflect the values or the lives of the 
most vulnerable Americans or the suc-
cess and security of hardworking fami-
lies across this country. 
This year, I am proud to, again, stand 
with my colleagues on the House Budg-
et Committee under the guidance of 
Chairman JOHN YARMUTH to work to 
protect the programs that the Presi-
dent is seeking to destructively slash 
in his proposal. 
Not only does his proposal threaten 
my constituents and their access to 
Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act 
programs that protect my constituents 
with preexisting conditions, but it also 
hacks away at my State’s and all of 
our States’ dollars for affordable hous-
ing and nutrition assistance, just to 
name a few. 
The White House proposes to cut 
spending by $4.6 trillion over a decade. 
Medicaid will see a cut of about $900 
billion in funding. Medicare would see 
about $500 billion in cuts over that 
same period. Funding for Federal dis-
ability programs, including Social Se-
curity Disability Insurance, would be 
cut $63 billion. The Supplemental Nu-
trition Assistance Program, or SNAP, 
would be cut by $182 billion over 10 
years as a result of the proposed stri-
dent work requirements proposed by 
this administration. 
This, after they gave themselves the 
biggest tax cut proposal enacted by 
Congress in 2017, giving the top billion-
aires and big corporations the greatest 
benefit from a $1.9 trillion tax cut. 
We knew it then and it is now prov-
ing out today: those tax cuts are being 
balanced on the backs of everyday 
Americans who are depending upon 
this Congress to stand up and to fight 
for them. 
So in the spirit of the 15th Amend-
ment, we know that every voice mat-
ters regardless of race, color, or pre-
vious condition of servitude. So today, 
my colleagues and I will raise both the 
commemoration 
of 
that 
important 
amendment as well as speak truth to 
power as it pertains to these horren-
dous budget cuts that are being pro-
posed. 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to yield to my colleague from 
the great State of California. She defi-
nitely speaks for me and so many other 
great Americans who are looking for 
strong advocates here in the United 
States Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), 
my friend. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman very 
much for yielding. 
First of all, I want to thank Con-
gressman HORSFORD for those generous 
comments, but also for his leadership 
on so many fronts and for constantly 
really looking out for the most vulner-
able and for those who oftentimes don’t 
have a voice here. 
I am really delighted that under the 
leadership of our fearless chair, Con-
gresswoman KAREN BASS, who chairs 
the Congressional Black Caucus, she 
asked Mr. HORSFORD to chair this Spe-
cial Order tonight, because it is so im-
portant that we talk about the budget 
cuts, and also in the context of com-
memorating this anniversary, the 150th 
anniversary of the ratification of the 
15th Amendment. 
We continue to be the conscience of 
the Congress, and it is so important 
that we not only remember our history 
and educate those who may have for-
gotten about it, but also talk about 
how we got to where we are today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1004 
February 10, 2020 
With these budget cuts that are 
going to severely, disproportionately 
impact the African American commu-
nity, how can we not make the connec-
tion between our history and what is 
taking place here with this administra-
tion. 
Let me just lay out a few more of the 
budget cuts very quickly. 
I do serve on the Budget Committee 
with Mr. HORSFORD, and so we are 
going to be dealing with this for the 
next few weeks and really lay out how 
horrendous these cuts are. 
I also serve on the Appropriations 
Committee as an appropriator. 
We have to do a deep dive on this to-
night, so let me just lay out a few more 
of these horrific cuts. 
There are cuts to lifesaving medical 
research. We’re talking about that this 
administration wants to cut the Na-
tional Institutes of Health by $3.3 bil-
lion and reduce the funding for the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention by $678 million. 
Education: 
This 
administration 
wants to impose an 8.5 percent cut on 
the Department of Education, which is 
a total cut of $6.2 billion, which in-
cludes cuts to after-school programs, 
which we, of course, know are ex-
tremely important in low-income com-
munities and in the Black community. 
Infrastructure: This budget reduces 
the funding for the Army Corps of En-
gineers, which fixes our Nation’s crum-
bling water infrastructure, by $1.7 bil-
lion. 
There are cuts to community devel-
opment. It eliminates the Community 
Development Block Grant, making it 
harder for communities to address 
needs like safe housing, economic op-
portunities, and public facilities im-
provements. 
It eliminates the HOME Program. 
Here we are trying to increase access 
to affordable housing and eliminate 
homelessness, yet this administration’s 
budget presents a cut in terms of just 
zeroing out the HOME Program. Of 
course, that is going to make it harder 
for low-income individuals to access af-
fordable housing programs. 
It reduces rural broadband, cuts 
funding—this is hard to believe—for 
small businesses. It cuts the funding 
for the Small Business Administra-
tion’s 
Entrepreneurial 
Development 
grants by $93 million, making it harder 
for small businesses to grow and com-
pete. 
We can go on and on and on, but we 
see this budget as a budget that we 
know is going to hurt those who don’t 
have a lot of money, quite frankly, and 
who are striving to take care of their 
families and to live the quality of life 
that they so deserve as Americans. 
So we are going to fight, and we are 
going to make sure that this budget is 
dead on arrival, but we think it is im-
portant to lay out what the values are 
that are in this budget. 
It is an immoral budget, it is uneth-
ical, it is un-American, and I hope that 
tonight people will really understand 
they need to sound the alarm. It really 
is a budget that requires designating 
this as a state of emergency. 
With regard to 150 years ago: African 
American men were given the right to 
vote with the ratification of the 15th 
Amendment, that was in 1870, but it 
was ratified, though, to ensure the 
freedoms outlined in the 13th and 14th 
Amendments. 
However, the promise of the 15th 
Amendment—going back now and right 
up to today—the integral promise of 
the right to vote for Black Americans 
was blocked, totally blocked until the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965, which I re-
member very well. I was in high school 
then. 
It was just quite remarkable that in 
our lifetime, that the 15th Amendment 
still wasn’t actualized. Almost a cen-
tury now after, here we see still vio-
lence, racially charged State and local 
laws subjected Black men to the use of 
poll taxes and literacy tests to prevent 
them from voting. 
Through these discriminatory tac-
tics, we still kept fighting. These tac-
tics attempted to stop Black Ameri-
cans from voting for our rights, but we 
are still fighting. 
It wasn’t just Black men who were 
fighting for equality and fairness. 
Black women were marching in the 
streets long after the ratification of 
the 19th Amendment granting White 
women the right to vote. Black women 
continued to face the same discrimina-
tion at the polls that Black men had 
faced since 1870. 
What is worse, Black women faced 
the compounded prejudices of anti- 
blackness and anti-women, but they 
were not deterred. They, we, continued 
to fight for equality along with African 
American men. 
Black women, like Mary Church 
Terrell, organized political organiza-
tions and participated in political 
meetings. Black women were involved 
in the U.S. political system long before 
they could legally cast a vote. 
Ninety-five years later, after decades 
of pressure and activism in the midst 
of the civil rights movement, then in 
1965 the Voting Rights Act made voting 
more accessible to Black men and 
women. Despite the protections that 
this law put into place, the Black vote 
is still suppressed. 
Now we have new barriers such as 
gerrymandering, voter ID laws, voter 
purges, and the closing of polling loca-
tions in many minority communities. 
Now, instead of a poll tax, commu-
nities 
of 
color, 
especially 
African 
American communities, are waiting in 
line for 7, 8, and even 10 hours to vote. 
Instead of making it easier to par-
ticipate in our democracy, we have 
States making it harder and pushing 
minorities out of reach. 
So today, 150 years after the 15th 
Amendment passed, this fight for the 
right to vote is more important than 
ever. 
Again, as I close, going back to these 
budget cuts, we have to let this admin-
istration know that there is power in 
the Black vote and that Black lives 
also do matter and that these budget 
cuts that we are talking about tonight, 
when you look at them, I am worried 
that they would take us back, take us 
way back to the days of Jim Crow and 
the days that we don’t even want to re-
member. 
So, Madam Speaker, to Congressman 
HORSFORD, this is very timely tonight. 
I thank the gentleman for this Special 
Order, because the 15th Amendment 
and what is taking place today are 
very, very connected, and we need to 
remind our constituents of the risks 
and the dangers that we face at this 
point in our history. 
b 1945 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from California 
again for her tremendous leadership 
and for reminding us about the history 
that brought us to this day, the fact 
that it was the 13th Amendment that 
abolished slavery; that it was the 14th 
Amendment that granted us citizen-
ship and equal civil and legal rights to 
freedom; but it was the 15th Amend-
ment, which was the last of the Recon-
struction Amendments, which was de-
signed to guarantee Black men the 
right to vote. 
As the gentlewoman rightly noted, 
Black women were a significant part of 
that effort, despite the fact that they 
weren’t included in those initial rights 
until the 19th Amendment was passed. 
The fact is that we have come so far 
and made so much progress with the 
Voting Rights Act and know that this 
body, we passed H.R. 4, but we can’t get 
agreement with our colleagues on the 
other side and the colleagues in the 
Senate to pass the Voting Rights Act. 
Fifty-five years after the initial Vot-
ing Rights Act was passed, to reauthor-
ize that in this body shows just how 
much of a struggle we have, whether it 
is with our voting rights, whether it is 
with legal protections, or whether it is 
with the values that are reflected in 
the budget that we are deliberating 
this week that the President will sub-
mit. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman very much for her words of wis-
dom and know that, with the gentle-
woman in this fight, we will continue 
to make progress and people will be 
heard. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
leadership. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE), my colleague who 
serves on the Budget Committee, as 
well as the Judiciary Committee and 
the Homeland Security Committee. 
She has many roles in which she un-
derstands the impact of the budget, the 
budget proposal that has been sub-
mitted by the President, which makes 
tremendous cuts to vital social service 
and safety net programs, as well as the 
threat and the assault that is on the

H1005 
February 10, 2020 
voting rights that we are speaking 
about tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me thank the gentleman from Ne-
vada for his great leadership and the 
importance of this moment tonight to 
honor 150 years of the passage of the 
15th Amendment, our right to vote, and 
to be joined by my colleagues, Con-
gresswoman LEE and Congresswoman 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, and we thank 
our chair, Congresswoman BASS. 
The Congressional Black Caucus is 
the conscience of this Nation and al-
ways stands in the gap for the very im-
portant leadership on this issue. 
Might I also thank our colleague, 
whom we are so blessed to have 
amongst us. I think the gentleman 
takes the title of singularly being the 
conscience and the heart of the Con-
gress. That is the Honorable JOHN 
LEWIS, who works with us and has al-
ways been our guide as relates to the 
question of the Voting Rights Act. 
Many of you are reminded of the fact 
that, as that Voting Rights Act was 
fought for and rejected and thought it 
was too dangerous to pass in the 1960s, 
moving up to 1965, it took the march 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 
Selma, Alabama, when JOHN
LEWIS, 
among others, was beaten almost to 
death and bloodied on that bridge by 
horsemen from the Alabama State Po-
lice. What a bloody and horrific scene. 
None of us can imagine what JOHN 
LEWIS went through. 
He has continued in his service in the 
United States Congress to stand stead-
fast with us and to remind us that it is 
better to do the right thing, regardless 
of the consequences. When I think of 
him and this 150th year, I am reminded 
of how we should stand and fight and 
be reminded, again, that the precious 
right to vote can be one that can be 
quick and fade in the night and be 
taken away in the twinkle of an eye, as 
has been attempted over the years. 
President Johnson addressed the Na-
tion before signing the Voting Rights 
Act, and said: ‘‘The vote is the most 
powerful instrument ever devised by 
man for breaking down injustice and 
destroying the terrible walls which im-
prison men,’’ and women, ‘‘because 
they are different from other men,’’ 
and women. 
It is important to remind the Nation 
of the history of African Americans, 
the descendants now of enslaved Afri-
cans, to remind this Congress that, for 
nearly 250 years, the peculiar institu-
tion of slavery fed into the Nation’s 
booming industries and facilitated its 
boundless growth. 
We were the economic engine of this 
Nation—slave, brutal labor. And as this 
country 
prospered, 
enslaved 
people 
were denied the fruits of their labor: no 
workers’ compensation, no life insur-
ance, no days off, no weekends. They 
were brutalized without vote, without 
presence, without even the dignity of 
being one person. 
They were denied a voice in Amer-
ica’s fledgling democracy and only 
began to see that change as the at-
tempt came to make a difference by, in 
1869, passing the 15th Amendment over 
impassioned opposition. 
The 
13th 
Amendment 
had 
been 
passed. As my recollection serves me, 
President Lincoln was not able to see 
the final passage of that, but that was 
passed—and how horrific that was—to 
be able to finally have slavery denied. 
In 
1869, 
the 
lameduck 
Congress 
passed the 15th Amendment over im-
passioned 
opposition, 
but, 
Madam 
Speaker, it did not last long. 
In 1876, this thing call Reconstruc-
tion, the many African Americans who 
were in the Senate and House were 
stricken out because of the 1876 com-
promise to take the priority of the 
South over the rights of human beings. 
And then came the horrors of poll tax, 
literacy tests, violence, Jim Crowism, 
the 
brutality 
against 
anyone 
who 
wanted to vote. 
Even when the 19th Amendment 
came in 1920, it was not Black women 
who received the right to vote. So this 
is a worthy honoring. 
My predecessor, the Honorable Bar-
bara Jordan, my mentor and someone 
who encouraged me in the position I 
am now in, indicated, with her leader-
ship in 1975, she was wise enough to in-
clude the State of Texas by adding to 
the Voting Rights Act Mexican Ameri-
cans. She said: 
There are Mexican American people in the 
State of Texas who have been denied the 
right to vote, who have been impeded in 
their efforts to register and vote, who have 
not had encouragement from those election 
officials because they are brown people. 
By adding the Mexican American 
population 
community, 
Texas 
was 
added to the Voting Rights Act, and, lo 
and behold, we have suffered even with 
that addition because we have had poll 
tax ourselves. We have had the on-
slaught of the voter ID bill. The purg-
ing has been enormous in the State of 
Texas: the moving of polls, lights being 
out, electricity being out, machines 
not working. 
I recall in the 1940s, there were only 
30,000 African American voters, and a 
small percentage of them throughout 
the South were registered to vote. We 
are back where we were. 
The State of Texas, as we come up on 
this election, has taken away a tool 
that has been used for decades, and 
that is the right to push a straight 
ticket. They know that the success of 
the 2018 election came about through 
young voters and elderly voters and di-
verse voters who knew how to do that 
one vote with these long ballots, and 
they took away that very right. 
The people could choose if they want-
ed to vote for one party or another. We 
are looking at whether or not that is 
violating the Voting Rights Act. It 
takes away a choice. 
Let me conclude my remarks by indi-
cating the importance of this legisla-
tion and, again, take some words from 
President 
Lyndon 
Baines 
Johnson: 
‘‘Presidents and Congresses, laws and 
lawsuits can open the doors to the poll-
ing places and open the doors to the 
wondrous rewards which await the wise 
use of the ballot. But only the indi-
vidual Negro, and all others who have 
been denied the right to vote, can real-
ly walk through those doors, and can 
use that right, and can transform the 
vote into an instrument of justice and 
fulfillment.’’ 
Lyndon Baines Johnson didn’t realize 
that counties and cities and States 
across America would find ways to stop 
those on the basis of race and color and 
some other form of discrimination. He 
didn’t realize that his job had not 
ended with the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 and as we reauthorized it just a 
few years ago. He did not realize that 
people would still be stopped from vot-
ing, those who have been incarcerated, 
mostly people of color. 
Today, I pay tribute to my colleague 
who is leading this and pay tribute to 
the colleagues who are bringing us to 
recognize the 150 years. It is good to 
recognize, but the fight still is main-
tained. 
If their vote at the ballot box is 
going to be the change agent of this 
Nation so homeless persons will not 
still be homeless, people who are hun-
gry will not still be hungry, small busi-
nesses that want to open their doors 
will not be denied because of the 
present leadership and administration, 
our vote counts, and the honor and 
tribute that we can give to those who 
were enslaved for 250 years is to use the 
precious right to vote. 
As they do so, our colleagues on the 
floor of this House will pay tribute to 
them by passing, as well, H.R. 40, which 
is a commission to study reparations 
and proposals. 
Use your vote for a reason to enhance 
and uplift. 
Use your vote to save those who can-
not speak for themselves: the hungry 
and those who need access to medical 
care. 
Use your vote. That is the challenge 
for all of us. 
Honor the 150th year by your action, 
by your vote, and by your commitment 
to this Nation. 
Madam Speaker, 150 years ago this month, 
the 15th Amendment to the Constitution was 
ratified and because of that Amendment, and 
the Voting Rights Act it authorized and Presi-
dent Lyndon Johnson signed into law, I stand 
before you as Congresswoman Sheila Jack-
son Lee, who in 2017 became the first African 
American woman to attain the position of 
Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Sub-
committee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Se-
curity, and Investigations. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today not just to 
commemorate the landmark achievement of 
150 years ago but to inform our colleagues 
and the nation of the need to redouble and re-
dedicate our efforts to the work that remains 
to be done to protect the right of all Americans 
to vote free from discrimination and the injus-
tices that prevent them from exercising this 
most fundamental right of citizenship.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1006 
February 10, 2020 
On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the 
Capitol and in the presence of such luminaries 
as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and 
Rev. Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Chris-
tian Leadership Conference; Roy Wilkins of 
the NAACP; Whitney Young of the National 
Urban League; James Foreman of the Con-
gress of Racial Equality; A. Philip Randolph of 
the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John 
Lewis of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating 
Committee; Senators Robert Kennedy, Hubert 
Humphrey, and Everett Dirksen; President 
Johnson addressed the nation before signing 
the Voting Rights Act: 
The vote is the most powerful instrument 
ever devised by man for breaking down injus-
tice and destroying the terrible walls which im-
prison men because they are different from 
other men. 
Madam Speaker, for nearly 250 years, ‘‘the 
peculiar institution’’ of slavery fed into the na-
tion’s booming industries and facilitated its 
boundless growth. 
Even as the country prospered, enslaved 
people were denied the fruits of their own 
labor. 
They were also denied a voice in America’s 
fledgling democracy. 
This only began to change in the middle of 
the 19th century. 
At the close of the Civil War, the nation 
wrangled with the future of nearly 4 million 
Black people who, until the adoption of the 
13th Amendment, had been held captive in 
the South. 
On the heels of the 13th Amendment, which 
formally ended slavery, Congress passed the 
14th Amendment to guarantee Black people 
citizenship and equality under the law. 
But suffrage was an entirely separate ques-
tion. 
As lawmakers mapped out plans to reunify 
the country, extending the right to vote was 
hardly a priority in the North but in the South, 
however, Black people were voting. 
In some states—Louisiana, Mississippi, and 
South Carolina—the African-American elec-
torate outnumbered its white counterpart be-
cause in 1867, when Congress passed the 
Reconstruction Acts, the new laws estab-
lished, among other things, conditions for the 
former Confederate states’ return to the Union. 
Perhaps the most important stipulation was 
that the readmitted states had to draft new 
constitutions that guaranteed suffrage to citi-
zens regardless of their race. 
It didn’t take long for Lincoln Republicans in 
Congress to recognize that for Reconstruction 
to have a chance, African Americans would 
have to be able advocate for themselves in 
elections. 
So in 1869, the lame-duck Congress passed 
the 15th Amendment over impassioned posi-
tion. 
The amendment, which was ratified in less 
than a year, made it illegal to ‘‘deny’’ or 
‘‘abridge’’ the right to vote ‘‘on account of 
race, color, or previous condition of servitude’’ 
and gave Congress the power to enforce the 
new law. 
Soon, Black people began voting not only in 
the South but throughout the country. 
They were elected to statewide office and 
were even sent to Washington to represent 
Americans in both houses of Congress. 
That it all ended in 1876 when the Hayes- 
Tilden Compromise resolving the 1876 presi-
dential election ended Reconstruction. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to 
preventing brazen voter discrimination viola-
tions that historically left millions of African 
Americans disenfranchised. 
In 1940, for example, there were less than 
30,000 African Americans registered to vote in 
Texas and only about 3 percent of African 
Americans living in the South were registered 
to vote. 
Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of vio-
lence were the major causes of these racially 
discriminatory results. 
After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 
1965, which prohibited these discriminatory 
practices, registration and electoral participa-
tion steadily increased to the point that by 
2012, more than 1.2 million African Americans 
living in Texas were registered to vote. 
In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights 
Act became law, there were approximately 
300 African Americans in public office, includ-
ing just three in Congress. 
Few, if any, African Americans held elective 
office anywhere in the South. 
Because of the Voting Rights Act, today 
there are more than 9,100 black elected offi-
cials, including 46 members of Congress, the 
largest number ever. 
The Voting Rights Act opened the political 
process for many of the approximately 6,000 
Hispanic public officials that have been elect-
ed and appointed nationwide, including more 
than 275 at the state or federal level, 32 of 
whom serve in Congress. 
Native Americans, Asians and others who 
have historically encountered harsh barriers to 
full political participation also have benefited 
greatly. 
The crown jewel of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 is Section 5, which requires that states 
and localities with a chronic record of discrimi-
nation in voting practices secure federal ap-
proval before making any changes to voting 
processes. 
Section 5 protects minority voting rights 
where voter discrimination has historically 
been the worst. 
Since 1982, Section 5 has stopped more 
than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes in 
their 
tracks, 
including 
107 
discriminatory 
changes right here in Texas. 
And it is a source of eternal pride to all of 
us in Houston that in pursuit of extending the 
full measure of citizenship to all Americans, in 
1975 Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who 
also represented this historic 18th Congres-
sional District of Texas, introduced, and the 
Congress adopted, what are now Sections 
4(f)(3) and 4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights Act, 
which extended the protections of Section 4(a) 
and Section 5 to language minorities. 
During the floor debate on the 1975 reau-
thorization of the Voting Rights Act, Congress-
woman Jordan explained why this reform was 
needed: 
There are Mexican-American people in the 
State of Texas who have been denied the 
right to vote; who have been impeded in 
their efforts to register and vote; who have 
not had encouragement from those election 
officials because they are brown people. 
So, the state of Texas, if we approve this 
measure, would be brought within the cov-
erage of this Act for the first time. 
When it comes to extending and protecting 
the precious right vote, the Lone Star State— 
the home state of Lyndon Johnson and Bar-
bara Jordan—can be the leading state in the 
Union, one that sets the example for the na-
tion. 
But to realize that future, we must turn from 
and not return to the dark days of the past. 
We must remain ever vigilant and oppose 
all schemes that will abridge or dilute the pre-
cious right to vote. 
Madam Speaker, I am here today to remind 
the nation that the right to vote—that ‘‘power-
ful instrument that can break down the walls of 
injustice’’—is facing grave threats. 
The threat stems from the decision issued in 
June 2013 by the Supreme Court in Shelby 
County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which 
invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and para-
lyzed the application of the VRA’s Section 5 
preclearance requirements. 
According to the Supreme Court majority, 
the reason for striking down Section 4(b) was 
that ‘‘times change.’’ 
Now, the Court was right; times have 
changed. 
But what the Court did not fully appreciate 
is that the positive changes it cited are due al-
most entirely to the existence and vigorous 
enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. 
And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still 
needed. 
Let me put it this way: in the same way that 
the vaccine invented by Dr. Jonas Salk in 
1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did 
not eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting 
Rights Act succeeded in stymieing the prac-
tices that resulted in the wholesale disenfran-
chisement of African Americans and language 
minorities but did eliminate them entirely. 
The Voting Rights Act is needed as much 
today to prevent another epidemic of voting 
disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk’s vaccine is 
still needed to prevent another polio epidemic. 
However, officials in some states, notably 
Texas and North Carolina, seemed to regard 
the Shelby decision as a green light and 
rushed to implement election laws, policies, 
and practices that could never pass muster 
under the Section 5 preclearance regime. 
My constituents remember very well the 
Voter ID law passed in Texas in 2011, which 
required every registered voter to present a 
valid government-issued photo ID on the day 
of polling in order to vote. 
The Justice Department blocked the law in 
March of 2012, and it was Section 5 that pro-
hibited it from going into effect. 
At least it did until the Shelby decision, be-
cause on the very same day that Shelby was 
decided officials in Texas announced they 
would immediately implement the Photo ID 
law, and other election laws, policies, and 
practices that could never pass muster under 
the Section 5 preclearance regime. 
The Texas Photo ID law was challenged in 
federal court and thankfully, just yesterday, the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 
upheld the decision of U.S. District Court 
Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos that Texas’ 
strict voter identification law discriminated 
against blacks and Hispanics and violated 
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 
Madam Speaker, protecting voting rights 
and combating voter suppression schemes are 
two of the critical challenges facing our great 
democracy. 
Without safeguards to ensure that all citi-
zens have equal access to the polls, more in-
justices are likely to occur and the voices of 
millions silenced. 
Those of us who cherish the right to vote 
justifiably are skeptical of Voter ID laws be-
cause we understand how these laws, like poll

taxes and literacy tests, can be used to im-
pede or negate the ability of seniors, racial 
and language minorities, and young people to 
cast their votes. 
Consider the demographic groups who lack 
a government issued ID: 
1. African Americans: 25 percent; 
2. Asian Americans: 20 percent; 
3. Hispanic Americans: 19 percent; 
4. Young people, aged 18–24: 18 percent; 
and 
5. Persons with incomes less than $35,000: 
15 percent. 
And there are other ways abridging or sup-
pressing the right to vote, including: 
1. Curtailing or eliminating early voting; 
2. Ending same-day registration; 
3. Not counting provisional ballots cast in 
the wrong precinct on Election Day will not 
count; 
4. Eliminating adolescent pre-registration; 
5. Shortening poll hours; and 
6. Lessening the standards governing voter 
challenges thus allowing self-proclaimed ‘‘bal-
lot security vigilantes’’ like the King Street Pa-
triots to cause trouble at the polls. 
Specifically, I call for the passage of H.R. 4, 
the Voting Rights Advancement Act, of which 
I am an original co-sponsor, which repairs the 
damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the 
Supreme Court’s Shelby decision. 
This legislation replaces the old ‘‘static’’ cov-
erage formula with a new dynamic coverage 
formula, or ‘‘rolling trigger,’’ which effectively 
gives the legislation nationwide reach because 
any state and any jurisdiction in any state po-
tentially is subject to being covered if the req-
uisite number of violations are found to have 
been committed. 
Madam Speaker, before concluding there is 
one other point I would like to stress. 
In his address to the nation before signing 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, President John-
son said: 
Presidents and Congresses, laws and law-
suits can open the doors to the polling places 
and open the doors to the wondrous rewards 
which await the wise use of the ballot. 
But only the individual Negro, and all oth-
ers who have been denied the right to vote, 
can really walk through those doors, and can 
use that right, and can transform the vote 
into an instrument of justice and fulfillment. 
In other words, political power—and the jus-
tice, opportunity, inclusion, and fulfillment it 
provides—comes not from the right to vote but 
in the exercise of that right. 
And that means it is the civic obligation of 
every citizen to both register and vote in every 
election, state and local as well as federal. 
Because if we can register and vote, but fail 
to do so, we are guilty of voluntary voter sup-
pression, the most effective method of dis-
enfranchisement ever devised. 
And in recent years, Americans have not 
been doing a very good job of exercising our 
civic responsibility to register, vote, and make 
their voices heard. 
Madam Speaker, for millions of Americans, 
the right to vote made possible by the 15th 
Amendment and protected by the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned 
by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of 
ordinary Americans who showed the world it 
was possible to accomplish extraordinary 
things. 
So on this 150th anniversary of that land-
mark amendment, let us rededicate ourselves 
to honoring those who won for us this pre-
cious right by remaining vigilant and fighting 
against both the efforts of others to abridge or 
suppress the right to vote and our own apathy 
in exercising this sacred right. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Texas for her 
tremendous leadership and for bringing 
such concise points to both the budget 
realities that we are faced with in this 
current budget proposal by the admin-
istration, as well as what is at stake 
with the 150th anniversary of the pas-
sage of the 15th Amendment. 
The fact that so many people have 
worked so hard for prior generations, 
we now, in this generation and those 
Members here in this body who have 
been duly elected by our constituents, 
have a solemn responsibility to respect 
that Amendment and the protections 
that come with it. 
Too many times in this body, we 
have had an opportunity for our col-
leagues on the other side to work with 
us in a bipartisan manner to pass the 
reauthorization of the Voting Rights 
Act. Fortunately, the House Democrats 
have moved it as part of the For the 
People Agenda. It is sitting on Senator 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s desk. We are ask-
ing them to take that bill up and to 
vote on it in honor of the passage of 
the 15th Amendment and its 150th An-
niversary. 
I thank the gentlewoman for bring-
ing that perspective to the floor to-
night. We are calling on all of our col-
leagues to work with us on this impor-
tant legislation, as well as H.R. 40 and 
the other measures that the gentle-
woman spoke about. 
I thank the gentlewoman for her 
time tonight. 
I now yield to a great leader in this 
body. She serves as the chair of the 
House Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology. She is also a member 
of the Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture Committee. 
As the chair of the Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology, she is 
one of five chairs for the Congressional 
Black Caucus. That is a tremendous ac-
complishment in its own right, but it 
reflects the legacy on which we stand 
as Members of this body. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JOHNSON). 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand 
with the Members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus tonight to celebrate the 
ratification of the 15th Amendment to 
the United States Constitution, which 
granted African American men the 
right to vote. 
The 15th Amendment of the United 
States Constitution prohibits the Fed-
eral Government and each State from 
denying a citizen the right to vote 
based upon the citizen’s race, color, or 
previous condition of servitude. 
We are still fighting for that right; 
although, we are celebrating the 150th 
anniversary of that right. 
In Texas and throughout our coun-
try, we are still fighting for the right 
to vote and the right to have our voices 
heard without ridiculous impediments 
and barriers that you have heard about 
tonight. The memories of the poll tax 
and jelly bean jars to be counted are 
still with us. 
I am old enough to remember that, 
when I became 21, at that time, to 
vote, I had to pay a poll tax. So it was 
important to be able to just vote. But 
I say to young people today that we 
still have to fight equally as hard for 
our right to vote. 
I have lived through the periods in 
American history when the funda-
mental right to vote has been continu-
ously challenged for people of color, 
where discrimination was the law of 
the land and separate but equal was 
the norm. These rights guaranteeing 
the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to 
the Constitution are sacred and con-
tinue to be protected so we may live in 
freedom. But the fight for freedom is 
daily. 
The 15th Amendment is part of the 
Reconstruction Amendments. The 13th 
Amendment abolished slavery. The 
14th Amendment granted citizenship to 
all persons born or naturalized in the 
United States and guaranteed all citi-
zens equal protection under the laws. 
And the 15th Amendment protected the 
right to vote. 
b 2000 
The 13th and 14th Amendments were 
intended to establish equal rights for 
former slaves, and here we are, cele-
brating the 150th anniversary and still 
being treated as if slavery is the law of 
the land. 
Reconstruction, a period in American 
history that lasted more than a decade, 
from 1863 to 1877, was devastating for 
African Americans and denied us the 
basic freedoms promised by the Con-
stitution. This led to mass segregation 
in the South. 
Clearly, our young people of color 
today did not live through much of 
this, and many of us didn’t. Yet, we 
continue to live it every day. 
Madam Speaker, you have heard re-
marks on the budget, and you have 
heard remarks that specifically single 
out people who are least able to look 
out for themselves because of segrega-
tion and racism. They are also the ones 
who are first to be punished. 
We will not be silenced, however. We 
will use our right to stand for all the 
people who have been guaranteed the 
right to be full Americans until we be-
come full Americans. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for her strong 
leadership, for sharing her perspective 
tonight, and for reminding us about 
the reality of the poll tax, the literacy 
tests, and the grandfather clauses that 
were once common mechanisms used to 
disadvantage minority voters, particu-
larly African American voters. 
Tonight, Madam Speaker, again, we 
are recognizing the 150th anniversary 
after the ratification of the 15th 
Amendment. Tremendous gains were

February 10, 2020 
made during that Reconstruction pe-
riod, where well over 2,000 Black men 
were elected to local, State, and Fed-
eral office, 16 of whom served in Con-
gress. 
For instance, Hiram Rhodes Revels, 
the first African American Senator 
representing Mississippi, was elected to 
Congress in 1870. Senator Revels was 
sometimes called the 15th Amendment 
in flesh and blood. 
Senator Revels and his colleagues 
were only part of the story. All told, 
about 2,000 African Americans held 
public office at some level of govern-
ment during Reconstruction. 
But, sadly, this happened in the face 
of literacy tests, poll taxes, and grand-
father clauses, once the most common 
mechanisms used for disadvantaging 
minority voters. 
After the end of Reconstruction, 
these amendments were rarely enforced 
for nearly 100 years after their ratifica-
tion. So even despite the fact that 
these gains were made, they were not 
enforced. That is why we need to have 
laws that are enforced, and we need to 
remind this administration that they 
are not above the law and that they 
have to follow the law and enforce the 
law. 
Black families were separated from 
their White counterparts and forced to 
use lesser facilities. They were ma-
ligned, tormented, and treated without 
respect. Black children were forced to 
attend rundown schools without the 
necessary books to succeed. 
This rampant segregation thrived 
across the country until the Supreme 
Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of 
Education, which struck down the in-
herently flawed concept of separate but 
equal. Sadly, we are still trying to en-
sure that separate-but-equal concept 
no longer applies. 
It is 150 years on from the ratifica-
tion of the Black men’s right to vote, 
however, and we are still fighting to 
protect those rights in the face of voter 
suppression efforts across this country. 
Each election cycle, untold numbers 
of eligible Americans are prevented 
from voting due to barriers in the voter 
registration process and restrictions on 
casting ballots. Just since the 2010 
elections, 24 States have implemented 
new restrictions on voting. 
Alabama now requires a photo ID to 
cast a ballot. 
Other States, such as Ohio and Geor-
gia, have enacted use-it-or-lose-it laws, 
which strike voters from registration 
rolls if they have not participated in an 
election within a prescribed period of 
time. 
In Georgia, in 2018, 53,000 voter reg-
istrants, 70 percent of whom were 
Black, were unable to vote because of 
minor misspellings or missing hyphens 
on their registration forms. 
That is why we must draw attention 
to the suppression of the Black vote on 
this day that we honor the ratification 
of the 15th Amendment. Our ancestors 
require it. 
While today we mark the ratification 
of the 15th Amendment and the Black 
men’s right to vote as my colleague, 
Representative 
BARBARA
LEE, 
indi-
cated, we must also acknowledge that 
Black women were denied that right 
for nearly another 100 years. 
During the 19th and 20th centuries, 
Black women played an active role in 
the struggle for universal suffrage. We 
will be recognizing the 100-year anni-
versary of the 19th Amendment this 
August, and it is important that we re-
member that Black women attended 
political conventions at their local 
churches where they planned strategies 
to gain the right to vote. 
In the late 1800s, Black women across 
the country worked for churches, news-
papers, secondary schools, and colleges, 
which gave them a larger platform to 
promote their ideas. They participated 
in political meetings and organized po-
litical societies. 
In spite of their hard work, many 
people didn’t listen to them. Black men 
and White women usually led civil 
rights organizations and set the agen-
da, and they often excluded Black 
women from their organizations and 
activities. 
In 1896, reformers like Josephine St. 
Pierre Ruffin and Charlotte Forten 
Grimke founded the National Associa-
tion of Colored Women to discuss ways 
of attaining women’s rights and wom-
en’s suffrage. Their motto was: Lifting 
as We Climb. 
In 1913, Ida B. Wells founded the 
Alpha Suffrage Club of Chicago, the 
Nation’s first Black women’s club fo-
cused specifically on suffrage. Seven 
years after the founding of the Alpha 
Suffrage Club, the 19th Amendment 
was ratified. 
The 
19th 
Amendment 
technically 
granted women in the United States 
the right vote, but Black women were 
excluded from those rights due to the 
ever-present 
racism 
still 
pervading 
every corner of society in this country 
at that time. It wasn’t until the Voting 
Rights Act was passed nearly a half- 
century later on August 6, 1965, that 
Black women were officially allowed to 
exercise their right to vote—Madam 
Speaker, 1965. 
Yet, Black women today are the 
strongest in our families. They are 
strong in our communities, and they 
are strong civically. They understand 
how much has been fought and has 
been sacrificed in order for them to 
have that right. 
So when I talk to young people and 
they ask me: Why should I vote? Why 
does this matter? What do I have to 
lose? 
We need to be reminded tonight that 
people had a lot to lose. Some lost and 
some gave their very life, Members like 
our esteemed civil rights icon JOHN 
LEWIS gave blood so that we would 
have the right to vote. 
It is important for us to remember 
that right. That right is based on this 
premise that the Federal Government 
and each State may not deny a citizen 
the right to vote based on that citi-
zen’s race, color, or previous condition 
of servitude. 
That last piece I really want to un-
derscore because the massive incarcer-
ation that has occurred over the last 
few decades and the number of for-
merly incarcerated citizens who still to 
this day in some States do not have 
their right to vote, the 15th Amend-
ment guarantees them that right. 
As we recognize this 150th anniver-
sary, we need to challenge policies like 
the one in Florida where the people of 
Florida decided to restore those for-
merly incarcerated citizens and give 
them the ability to vote, and then the 
Republicans in the legislature imposed 
a fee for them to be able to vote. That 
is not what this says under the 15th 
Amendment. 
Those in Georgia being denied the 
right to vote by having their name 
stricken from the voting rolls, that is 
not what the protections under the 
15th Amendment provide for. 
This is something that, to me, is very 
alarming because it speaks to the very 
essence of who we are as a people and 
the democracy that we uphold in this 
institution. So, tonight, I want to com-
mend my colleagues, the entire Con-
gressional Black Caucus; our chair-
woman, KAREN BASS; and every single 
Member who will stand with us to pass 
H.R. 4, which we have done out of this 
House to call on Senate Majority Lead-
er MITCH MCCONNELL and to ask him to 
bring that bill to a vote, for the Presi-
dent to sign it, to ensure that every 
single person’s vote is protected in this 
country and that we end these tactics 
where we are intimidating people from 
participating in this process. 
This goes to the civic engagement of 
this country. People should participate 
by registering to vote. They should 
participate in the Census, which is oc-
curring this year. They should partici-
pate by making sure their voice is 
heard at the ballot box every election. 
Madam Speaker, again, I thank my 
colleagues for joining me for this Spe-
cial Order hour. As we commemorate 
the 150th anniversary of the 15th 
Amendment, we remind ourselves what 
is at stake. As we deliberate on the 
President’s budget tomorrow and in 
the coming weeks, let us be reminded 
of what is at stake. 
I know for me and the people whom I 
represent in Nevada’s Fourth District, 
my job is to never forget where I come 
from, what I am fighting for, or whom 
I am fighting for, and it is the people of 
my district. 
I am proud that Nevada was the first 
State of the 28 States to ratify the 15th 
Amendment. We did so on March 1, 
1869. We are battle born in Nevada. We 
come from a strong history, and one of 
the things that we will always do is 
protect the rights of our fellow citizens 
to have their voice heard. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. FUDGE. Madam Speaker, this month, 
we mark the 150th Anniversary of the ratifica-
tion of the 15th Amendment, granting African 
American men the right to vote. Later this 
year, we will also celebrate the centennial of

February 10, 2020 
the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which 
granted women, and therefore African Amer-
ican women, the right to vote. 
These important anniversaries give special 
meaning to Black History Month this year, re-
flected in the 2020 theme, ‘‘African Americans 
and the Vote.’’ This theme speaks to the long 
struggle on the part of Black men and women 
to secure their place in American democracy, 
through the Constitution and its guarantee of 
an unfettered and unabridged right to vote. 
The 15th Amendment was the third and final 
amendment adopted in the aftermath of the 
Civil War. Together, the 13th, 14th, and 15th 
amendments abolished slavery, granted citi-
zenship to African Americans and etched the 
right to vote into the Constitution. 
While these amendments protected and ex-
panded the rights of African Americans, too 
often throughout our history these rights ex-
isted on paper only. For the first century fol-
lowing ratification of the 15th Amendment, ra-
cial violence, poll taxes, and other forms of 
voter discrimination and disenfranchisement 
prevented African Americans from making 
their voices heard at the ballot box. 
Progress was slow. For every one step for-
ward, we were often pushed two steps back. 
But the Civil Rights movement and, most im-
portantly, the passage of the Voting Rights Act 
in 1965 brought America closer to its promise 
of all Americans receiving equal protection 
under the law. 
This struggle continues today. A century 
and a half after receiving the right to vote and 
more than 50 years after passage of the Vot-
ing Rights Act, African Americans continue to 
face discrimination and barriers at the ballot 
box. Voter purges, early voting cutbacks, strict 
ID requirements, and discriminatory gerry-
mandering of legislative districts are just some 
of the modern-day tactics that prevent African 
Americans from making their voices heard. 
As we celebrate this important anniversary, 
may we work to fulfill the text of the 15th 
amendment, which said the right to vote ‘‘shall 
not be denied or abridged by the United 
States or by any state on account of race, 
color, or previous condition of servitude.’’ 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to commemorate the 150th anniversary of 
the ratification of the 15th Amendment to the 
Constitution. 
The right to vote freely and fairly is the foun-
dation of our democracy. And yet, 150 years 
ago, this great nation prohibited an entire 
group of citizens from voting by law. 150 years 
seems so long ago but at the same time so 
near to us now. 
We know that even though, 150 years ago, 
our lawmakers said you cannot deny voters 
based on the color of their skin, that states 
were still allowed to functionally discriminate 
against African Americans. Back then it was 
literacy tests, when they knew the people who 
could not read were by and large former 
slaves. Poll taxes for black people. Threats of 
having your house burned down, being beat-
en, or even murdered if you dared to try and 
exercise your Constitutional right to vote. 
These practices persisted for a long time, 
until the Civil Rights Movement of the 50s and 
60s. The brave actions of these peaceful pro-
testers put them directly into harms way. Many 
were beaten, like our colleague JOHN LEWIS, 
and tragically some were murdered, including 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Their leadership directly paved the way to 
the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
This landmark legislation finally prohibited any 
voting law that intentionally or not, resulted in 
the discrimination against racial minorities. 
Section 5 closely monitored states that had 
previously used such laws in the past, so they 
could not slip under the radar. 
Unfortunately, Section 5 enforcement was 
struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. 
The rationale was this fight was so long ago 
that such monitoring was not needed any-
more. I can assure you it was not that long 
ago to me nor anyone else who lived through 
it. 48 years is not even a lifetime for most 
Americans, and yet it was supposed to be 
long enough to correct nearly 400 years of op-
pression and disenfranchisement for African 
Americans. 
Of course, the predictable has now hap-
pened because 48 years was not long enough 
to right the wrongs. We are seeing new voting 
laws that will harm people of color, the poor, 
and the elderly disproportionately: new photo 
ID requirements, registration restrictions, and 
even mass purging of the voter rolls. Voter 
suppression is happening in 2020 in the same 
states Section 5 watched closely from 1965 to 
2013. 
We have indeed come a long way from 
codifying voter suppression explicitly by race. 
We have come a long way from the physical 
violence that was a real threat when heading 
to the polls. However, we still have so far to 
go. It is too easy to get complacent—to think 
what we have won cannot be taken back. But 
it can be, it already was in 2013. Now we 
have to get back to work—protect what we 
have and push for what we don’t. 
I rise today appreciating how far we have 
come in the last 150 years and remembering 
how far we must go in the next 150 years.

S949 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2020 
No. 27 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, You store up blessings 
for all who honor You. Lord, if angels 
must veil their faces in Your presence, 
shouldn’t we mere mortals embrace 
reverential awe? 
Today, empower our Senators to be 
strong and courageous as they make 
loyalty to You their highest priority. 
Smile on them with Your blessings, for 
You are the Author and Finisher of our 
salvation. Lord, grant that our law-
makers may know what is conducive 
for Your glory. 
Today, we lift our hearts in ceaseless 
praise to You, our strong deliverer. 
We pray in Your magnificent Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO EVELYN BIRKBY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I pay 
tribute to a remarkable Iowan. She is 
one of the longest serving newspaper 
columnists in America. 
She has an uncommon work ethic, 
having never missed a deadline in 70 
years. Her weekly commentary in the 
Shenandoah Valley News has blanketed 
her close-knit community in southwest 
Iowa for seven decades. 
Now—get 
this—at 
age 
100 
years 
young, Evelyn Birkby—mother, farm-
er’s wife, radio commentator—better 
yet, radio homemaker for KMA Radio— 
columnist, and author—is now retiring. 
Her readers will miss her byline and 
storytelling. Her neighborly columns 
about ordinary life in rural America 
have brought extraordinary joy to gen-
erations of Iowans. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning 
business is closed. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Andrew Lynn 
Brasher, of Alabama, to be United 
States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh 
Circuit. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
KENTUCKY FLOODING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
afternoon, my staff and I are con-
tinuing to monitor widespread flooding 
across Southeastern Kentucky. Heavy 
rainfall damaged homes, businesses, 
and infrastructure in those counties. 
Our Governor declared a state of emer-
gency and mobilized a full-scale re-
sponse for the areas in need. 
I am particularly grateful to the first 
responders who have already rescued 
and evacuated many Kentuckians from 
harm’s way. Their professionalism and 
courage have helped to keep this situa-
tion from becoming even worse. 
Many roads remain closed and hun-
dreds of residents are still without run-
ning water. Worse still, more rain is in 
the forecast in the coming days. This 
crisis, unfortunately, is not over yet. 
My office stands ready with local, 
State, and Federal officials to help 
families and communities however we 
can, as Kentuckians endure the re-
maining flooding and begin the recov-
ery process. 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
Mr. President, on a totally unrelated 
matter, 
as 
the 
impeachment 
trial 
ended last week, I offered preliminary 
thanks to a few of the individuals 
whose outstanding service helped the 
institution fulfill this unique and chal-
lenging responsibility. 
Rising to the occasion for just the 
third time in Senate history, it took 
herculean efforts from a long list of 
hard-working and dedicated people. So 
I would like to take a little bit of time 
this afternoon to share some Senate 
gratitude 
that 
too 
often 
goes 
unexpressed. 
After I name some key individuals 
and offices within the Senate, I will 
submit a fuller list for the RECORD. 
First, thanks to the Sergeant at 
Arms, Mike Stenger, and his entire 
team, especially the tremendous ef-
forts of our Deputy Sergeant at Arms, 
Jennifer Hemingway; our protocol ex-
perts, including Becky Schaaf and 
Carly Flick; Krista Beale and Bob 
Shelton of Capitol and Chamber Oper-
ations; and, of course, Grace Ridgeway 
and her remarkable Capitol Facilities 
team. 
Many other offices had to go far 
above and beyond their normal duties:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S950 
February 10, 2020 
the executive office, doorkeepers, Press 
Gallery directors, Printing and Graph-
ics, the Counsel, the Recording Studio, 
the Appointments Desk, the Switch-
board, and the Chief Information Offi-
cer. 
Thanks, of course, to the Secretary 
of the Senate, Julie Adams, and all of 
those vital Senate offices. 
In particular, I have to single out our 
Parliamentarians, 
Elizabeth 
MacDonough and Leigh Hildebrand, 
and 
Parliamentary 
Clerk 
Christy 
Amatos. This expert team of profes-
sionals sacrificed nights, weekends, 
and holidays to ensure that this insti-
tution was ready to navigate little- 
charted waters, follow infrequently 
used rules, and track with the letter of 
the rules at every turn. We are so 
grateful. 
Many others made huge contribu-
tions as well: the offices of the Legisla-
tive Clerk, the Official Reporters of De-
bates, the Journal Clerk, Captioning 
Services, the Senate Historian, Senate 
Security, the Curator’s Office, the Sen-
ate Library, and the Office of Printing 
and Document Services. 
Thanks also to the Architect of the 
Capitol’s team for making sure our 
physical plant was up to snuff, to 
Chairman ROY
BLUNT
on the Rules 
Committee and their staff, and to the 
Office of Senate Legal Counsel and the 
Government Publishing Office. 
As I mentioned last week, we are 
hugely grateful to the Capitol Police, 
the Senate pages, and the Chief Justice 
of the United States, John Roberts, and 
his staff. 
I would like to recognize Erin Sager 
Vaughn, on the staff of the Democratic 
Leader, Senator SCHUMER, for her 
many efforts, and all the offices on 
both sides, particularly the staff assist-
ants whose days became far busier dur-
ing matters of especially great public 
interest. 
Before I conclude, I need to thank 
several more players, specifically, on 
the Republican side and in my own of-
fice. Thanks to Chairman LINDSEY 
GRAHAM’s staff on the Judiciary Com-
mittee, who poured enormous work 
into this process, particularly Brendan 
Chestnut and Gabi Michalak; to Chair-
man GRASSLEY’s team on Senate Fi-
nance and to our Majority Whip, Sen-
ator THUNE, and the Whip office. 
I am enormously grateful to Laura 
Dove, the Secretary for the Majority, 
for literally working around the clock 
to listen carefully to our Members and 
map out the complex strategy for the 
Senate to fulfill our duty. Laura sat on 
the dais for this trial just like her fa-
ther Robert Dove before her, who was 
serving as Senate Parliamentarian in 
1999. 
Huge thanks to Robert Duncan, the 
Assistant Secretary, and their entirely 
stellar Cloakroom team: Chris Tuck, 
Megan Mercer, Noelle Ringel, Tony 
Hanagan, Katherine Foster, Brian Can-
field, and Abigail Baker. We very sim-
ply could not have done this without 
you. 
And last, but certainly not least, I 
need to thank my own staff. Working 
for Senate leadership tends to mean 
there is no normal. There is no easy 
day. Call it an occupational hazard, but 
even by those standards, the past sev-
eral months have required extraor-
dinary efforts from my talented team. 
Andrew Ferguson, my chief counsel, 
became a leading expert on every com-
ponent 
of 
impeachment 
seemingly 
overnight and offered invaluable coun-
sel, guidance, and leadership at every 
single stage of this process. 
Thanks as well to Robert Karem, my 
national security adviser, and Jim 
Neill and Erica Suares; to my commu-
nications director, David Popp and the 
entire team he oversees, led by Doug 
Andres, 
Andrew 
Quinn, 
and 
Scott 
Sloofman, including Dylan Vorbach, 
and, especially, the crack research 
team of Robert Utsey and David Haupt-
mann. 
Thanks to Sarah Fairchild, Alex-

Office of the Majority Leader: Valerie 
Chicola, Katherine Grayson, Emily Hauck, 
and Suzanne Youngblood. 
A great many talented and dedicated pro-
fessionals went far above and beyond the or-
dinary course of their duties to help the U.S. 
Senate complete this unusual but essential 
constitutional duty. This institution is not 
good enough at saying ‘‘thank you,’’ let 
alone after an undertaking of literally his-
toric proportions. We are grateful to all of 
you for your work—these past days and 
every day. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the im-
peachment process that has consumed 
our country over the last several 
months is finally at an end. Every 
Member of this Chamber has spent doz-
ens of hours, if not more, studying the 
precedents, listening to the House 
managers and the President’s legal 
team as they presented their argu-
ments, including the testimony of 13 
witnesses whose sworn testimony was 
presented during the Senate trial. 
In the end, the majority of the Sen-
ators agreed that President Trump 
should be acquitted of the charges 
brought by the House. No matter how 
each Senator voted or felt about the 
end result, I can hope that we would all 
agree on one thing, and that is, it is 
time to move forward. 
Impeachment has paralyzed the work 
of Congress for far too long, and we 
can’t continue to allow the divisions 
and partisan games that are associated 
with it to prevent us from doing the 
jobs we were sent here to do. We are 9 
months away from the next election. I 
think it is somewhere around 267 days, 
if I am not mistaken. That is when the 
American people will choose their next 
President and vote on the direction of 
the country. But until then, our con-
stituents expect us to use the remain-
der of the time we have here to find 
consensus where and when we can and 
to make progress on issues that they 
care most about. 
For my constituents in Texas, the 
No. 1 item on their list is prescription 
drug pricing. I continue to hear from 
my constituents in Texas who feel bur-
dened, confused, and down-right frus-
trated by rising costs at the pharmacy. 
One of the reasons why I think that is 
probably true is that under the Afford-
able Care Act deductibles have risen 
and copays have ballooned, such that 
consumers are now paying more out of 
pocket for their prescription drugs 
than ever before, because from all of 
the negotiated deals between the phar-
maceutical manufacturers and the pre-
scription pharmacy benefit managers, 
none of that savings directly goes into 
the pocket of the consumer. So with in-
creased deductibles and with expanded 
copays, my constituents, and, I dare 
say, all of our constituents are feeling 
more of that coming out of their pock-
et. 
Medications that people have been 
taking for years just keep getting more 
and more expensive with no expla-
nation behind the increase. To me, the 
No. 1 example of that is insulin. I sup-
port the role of our patent system to 
protect research and development of 
lifesaving and innovative drugs, that 
people get a period of exclusivity—the 
companies that bring them into the 
market—a period of exclusivity so they 
can recoup their sunk costs and per-
haps even make a profit, but there is 
just simply no explanation for a drug 
like insulin, that has been on the mar-
ket for so long, for people to see $1,200 
and higher copays, as we heard in the 
Senate Finance Committee hearing. 
A mother talked about her young son 
who was leaving the nest, so to speak, 
but he was unable to meet the $1,200 
copay. He was deferring decisions in his 
life like buying a house and perhaps 
even getting married because of the 
burden of that copay. We must do bet-
ter, particularly on drugs that have 
been on the market for a long, long 
time, like insulin, that are so impor-
tant for treating conditions like diabe-
tes. 
But perhaps the single most—well, it 
is really the most common concern I 
hear about is a drug called HUMIRA, 
and that is perhaps because it is the 
most widely prescribed drug in the 
world. This drug is a miracle drug, to 
be sure. It treats arthritis and a num-
ber of other immunodeficiency condi-
tions, and it has been available for 15 
years. 
Now, you typically think of an ex-
pensive drug as being one, as I said, 
freshly on the market, which has just 
completed costly research and develop-
ment, but a drug that has been around 
15 years, can it be still protected by 
those patents, even though it was sup-
posed to expire years earlier? Well, ap-
parently, it can. 
Smart lawyers with pharmaceutical 
manufacturers have figured a way to 
impose what is known as patent thick-
ets. In other words, they can request 
and get issued so many different pat-
ents that they literally can prolong the 
period in which a drug manufacturer 
can claim exclusive right to the sales 
of that drug. 
AbbVie, the company that makes 
HUMIRA, has figured this out. They 
figured out how to game the patent 
system so that no competition ever 
comes to market, and they remain the 
sole provider of this widely used drug. 
Their playbook involves an intricate 
maze of overlapping patents, which 
make it nearly impossible for a com-
petitor to come to market. 
Here is the best evidence of that. 
Today there are five companies that 
compete with HUMIRA in Europe, but 
all are blocked from their competing 
drugs being sold here in America until 
2023. That is as a result of this patent 
thicketing gamesmanship. The smart 
lawyers at AbbVie have effectively 
found loopholes that allow them to cre-
ate and maintain a monopoly. 
Unfortunately, this isn’t the only ex-
ample of anticompetitive behavior in 
the pharmaceutical industry. A num-
ber of my constituents have also told 
me about their experience with a drug 
called Namenda, which is used by pa-
tients with Alzheimer’s, a devastating 
disease. Like other new drugs, it began 
with an exclusivity period, where they 
were the sole provider, but when that 
period was coming to a close, the 
drugmaker switched from a twice-daily 
to a once-daily dose. Believe it or not, 
that triggers a new patent application. 
That 
move 
itself 
prevented 
phar-
macists from being able to switch pa-
tients to a lower cost generic, even 
though it is just as effective, so the 
company could continue to reap enor-
mous profits basically by just changing 
from twice-a-day to once-a-day appli-
cation. 
The enemy here is not our patent 
system. It is the abuse of the patent 
system by some pharmaceutical com-
panies—again, not all pharmaceutical 
companies—but some in ways that di-
rectly harm the people we represent, 
the American people. 
Earlier this year, I introduced a bill 
with my friend, the Democratic Sen-
ator 
from 
Connecticut, 
RICHARD 
BLUMENTHAL, to take aim at some of 
these corrupt practices. Our bill strikes 
the 
delicate 
balance 
between 
pro-
tecting innovation while increasing 
competition, and when it passes, it will 
be a win for every American who has 
felt the pain of sticker shock at the 
pharmacy. 
We know it takes a lot more than 
good policy to get a bill turned into 
law around here. It takes bipartisan-
ship. It takes broad consensus support 
to get the green light from the appro-
priate committees and to pass them 
through both Houses of the Senate. 
Well, you would think a bill like this 
that is bipartisan, has broad support, 
passed unanimously out of the Judici-
ary Committee, and reduces Federal 
spending would be a piece of cake to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S952 
February 10, 2020 
pass, but they haven’t been in the Sen-
ate during this period of our divisive-
ness. 
The senior Senator from New York, 
the Democratic leader, has refused to 
let this bill pass without a Broadway- 
scale production of other unrelated leg-
islation. Back in November, I came to 
the floor to ask that this bill be passed 
by unanimous consent—again, since it 
had passed unanimously out of the Ju-
diciary 
Committee, 
and 
we 
had 
hotlined the bill to see if there were 
any other objections in the Senate and 
found none. 
Well, in the month that followed, 
after the senior Senator from New 
York objected to passing that bill, I 
didn’t hear a single word from the Sen-
ator who had concerns about it, but 
when I came to the floor to ask that 
the bill be passed again, the senior Sen-
ator from New York, the Democratic 
leader, blocked it again. He doesn’t 
think it is bad policy. In fact, he ad-
mitted it is a good bill. He is not ob-
jecting to it because it is somehow a 
partisan bill that hasn’t gone through 
the regular order or would increase the 
national debt. As I said, none of these 
things are true of this legislation. 
The only reason the senior Senator 
from New York, the Democratic leader, 
objected to this bill is because he is en-
gaging in the kind of politics and 
gamesmanship that really gives Wash-
ington, DC, a bad name. It is true that 
my name, like a third of the Senators’ 
names, will be on the ballot in Novem-
ber, and Senator SCHUMER, apparently, 
is willing to punish his constituents in 
New York State by not allowing this 
bill to pass because he wants to make 
sure that nobody whose name is on the 
ballot, who happens to be a Republican, 
can claim any sort of advantage by get-
ting a win, legislatively. 
Well, unfortunately, while he is play-
ing those sort of politics and games, 
his own constituents are being harmed, 
and the American people are being de-
prived of the benefits of this bipartisan 
legislation. We saw this mentality dur-
ing the President’s impeachment trial 
too. We saw how the Democratic leader 
staged vote after vote—not because he 
felt like he had a shot at getting a con-
viction of President Trump and a re-
moval but strictly to make Senators 
whose names were going to be on the 
ballot in 2020 look bad. He wanted to 
get the best 30-second TV spot he could 
possibly get against all Republican 
Senators running in 2020. 
He knew he was going to lose on the 
main impeachment vote, so he focused 
on the one thing that has eluded him 
for many years, and that is, his aspira-
tion to become the next majority lead-
er. Now, in his bid to become the next 
majority leader, our colleague from 
New York is blocking a bill that would 
bring down drug prices not only in the 
State of Texas but in New York as well 
and every other State around the coun-
try. 
I wonder what the Senator’s con-
stituents in New York are telling him 
about blocking bipartisan legislation 
that would actually benefit them. This 
is at the same time that they are try-
ing to figure out how do they pay the 
higher copay or deductible for their 
prescriptions at the pharmacy. We are 
not even a month and a half into the 
new year, and drug prices are already 
on the rise, with an average increase of 
6 percent. HUMIRA, which I mentioned 
earlier, has already gone up 7.4 percent. 
So it is clear to me that this problem 
is not going to go away, and the time 
to act is now. I would encourage the 
Democratic leader to stop blocking the 
bill that his conference Member Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL of Connecticut and I 
have introduced, so we can address 
these rising costs and provide some 
much needed relief for our constitu-
ents. 
My constituents have asked me: 
What does Congress intend to do be-
tween now and the election? I usually 
mention: Well, we can deal with the 
prescription drugs, and we can help 
bring down the out-of-pocket costs. 
Hopefully, we can pass a highway infra-
structure bill that we are working on, 
one that passed unanimously out of the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee under the leadership of Sen-
ators Barrasso and Carper, but the 
third thing I think we ought to be able 
to do—and really it is a shame it has 
taken this long to act—is we need to 
take actions to confront the rising 
healthcare risks associated with e- 
cigarettes. 
E-CIGARETTES 
In December, I visited the University 
of North Texas Health Science Center 
in Fort Worth to learn more about the 
danger of e-cigarettes, particularly 
among adolescents. I heard from a 
young Texan named Anna Carey, who 
used to be among the many students at 
her high school using e-cigarettes. Like 
so many young people across the coun-
try, she became addicted. That is the 
point. E-cigarettes are not harmless. 
They deliver nicotine, which is an ad-
dictive drug, into your body, and that 
is the point of the e-cigarette. 
The one advantage it does have over 
tobacco is you don’t have to burn it, 
which also produces carcinogenic by-
products of combustion, but like so 
many people in the country, Anna be-
came addicted, and it didn’t take her 
long to experience severe health con-
sequences as a result of the use of this 
product. 
The once active 16-year-old became 
extremely lethargic and would experi-
ence random and severe chest pain. 
Eventually, she was admitted to Cook 
Children’s Hospital in Fort Worth and 
diagnosed with chemical-induced pneu-
monia in both her lungs. She said that 
was her wake-up call. Anna quit using 
e-cigarettes, and I am glad to report 
she has made a full recovery. Others 
have not been so lucky. 
She now shares her story in an effort 
to raise awareness and prevent other 
young people her age from going down 
the same path, but we can’t let young 
people like Anna lead this fight alone. 
We need to do more in Washington to 
do our job. This has been a high pri-
ority for Members on both sides of the 
aisle. One of our colleagues on the 
HELP Committee, the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee, continues to work to address 
this health challenge. 
The most effective way to prevent 
adolescents from facing the harmful 
consequences of these devices is to stop 
them from getting addicted in the first 
place. A recent survey found that one- 
third of underage e-cigarette users 
bought them over the internet, where 
it is easy to skirt the age require-
ments. That has to change. It has al-
ready changed for tobacco. We just 
want to apply the same standard to e- 
cigarettes. 
I have introduced a bill with the Sen-
ator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, 
to protect our children from becoming 
addicted to the nicotine produced by e- 
cigarettes, and I hope we will be able to 
make progress on this legislation soon. 
As I said, e-cigarettes and tobacco 
are on totally different playing fields 
when it comes to online purchases. For 
traditional cigarettes, there are clear 
guardrails in place to prevent minors 
from using online purchases to skirt 
the age requirements. At the time of 
delivery, the buyer has to sign and 
show an ID proving their age, which 
just makes sense. You are required to 
show an ID when you purchase ciga-
rettes at a gas station or convenience 
store, and online purchases should be 
the same, but in the case of e-ciga-
rettes, it is different. Anyone, no mat-
ter how old or young, can go online and 
buy e-cigarettes and have them deliv-
ered to their front door without the 
legal requirement of an ID, and you 
better believe that too many young 
people are taking advantage of that 
loophole without really fully under-
standing the dangers they are sub-
jecting themselves to. 
A recent survey found that about 
one-third of underage e-cigarette users 
bought them online. This legislation 
would change that. It wouldn’t add ad-
ditional requirements. It would simply 
apply the same requirements for the 
online sale of traditional cigarettes to 
e-cigarettes. 
As I said, this bill has broad bipar-
tisan support, as you think it would. 
So I am hopeful we can pass it and get 
it to the President’s desk soon so we 
can address this wave of addiction 
among our young people. 
With impeachment in the rearview 
mirror, I hope the Senate will come to-
gether and cross these critical items 
off of our to-do list. Our constituents, 
the American people, will benefit. 
We have a lot of work to do and a lot 
of work we can and should get done be-
tween now and the election in Novem-
ber, so I hope we will be able to make 
some progress. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S953 
February 10, 2020 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LANKFORD). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
RECOGNIZING THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, it is my 
privilege to rise and congratulate the 
Kansas City Chiefs on their victory 
over the 49ers in Super Bowl LTV last 
week in Miami, FL. 
With their victory, the Chiefs earned 
their second Super Bowl championship 
and their first since 1970. I would just 
note, as someone who was born just 
about 10 years after that first Super 
Bowl, I have literally been waiting my 
whole life for this, and, man, it is darn 
good. 
This victory was Coach Andy Reid’s 
222nd career win and, of course, his 
first Super Bowl title in his Hall of 
Fame career. 
The Chiefs were led by quarterback 
Patrick Mahomes. If you don’t know 
who Patrick Mahomes is, I don’t know 
where you have been for the last couple 
of years. Mahomes completed 26 of 42 
passes for 286 yards and 2 touchdowns. 
He rushed nine times for 29 yards and 
another touchdown, and he was named 
the game’s Most Valuable Player. 
Mahomes is the youngest player in 
the history of the NFL to win both the 
NFL MVP award and a Super Bowl 
title. Mahomes’ play in the Super Bowl 
was the culmination of a historic play-
off run, full of memorable moments, 
none more iconic than the ‘‘scamper 
down the sideline’’ for a touchdown to 
take the lead against the Tennessee Ti-
tans in the AFC championship game. 
It takes a team to win a Super Bowl, 
and everyone on this team did his part. 
Running back Damien Williams had 17 
carries for 104 yards and 1 touchdown, 
plus 4 catches for 29 yards and a touch-
down. Tight end Travis Kelce added six 
receptions for 43 yards and one touch-
down. Wide receiver Tyreek Hill had 
nine receptions for 105 yards, including 
that crucial 44-yard reception on third 
down with fewer than 7 minutes re-
maining in the fourth quarter. And 
wide receiver Sammy Watkins added 
another five catches for 98 yards. 
The defense and special teams did 
their part, too. Bashaud Breeland led 
the Chiefs with seven tackles and one 
interception. Defensive tackle Chris 
Jones was a disruptive force, batting 
down three passes from 49ers quarter-
back Jimmy Garoppolo. Defensive end 
Frank Clark sacked Garoppolo on 
fourth and 10 with fewer than 2 min-
utes remaining to seal the victory— 
maybe my favorite play of the game. 
And Harrison Butker was perfect, mak-
ing one field goal and four extra points. 
The entire Chiefs roster contributed to 
this historic victory. 
I ask unanimous consent that all of 
their names be listed in the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

Mr. HAWLEY. If I could just add a 
word about the Hunt family, who own 
the Chiefs and have led the Chiefs for 
decades now, Lamar Hunt founded the 
Chiefs more than six decades ago and 
helped shape the National Football 
League, 
including 
by 
coining 
the 
phrase ‘‘Super Bowl.’’ Those were his 
words. It was his idea. His legacy con-
tinues today with Clark and Tavia 
Hunt, who are remarkable people. 
The entire Hunt family deserves 
great credit for their unwavering com-
mitment to Kansas City, the State of 
Missouri, and the Chiefs organization, 
which they lead with tremendous poise, 
tremendous integrity, and tremendous 
honor. 
Congratulations to the Kansas City 
Chiefs, to their employees, to the hun-
dreds of thousands—maybe millions—of 
loyal fans out there, to Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer Clark Hunt, to 
President 
Mark 
Donovan, 
General 
Manager Brett Veach, Coach Reid, and 
his staff, trainers, and equipment man-
agers, all of whom contributed to this 
great victory. They have people all 
over the world asking ‘‘how ‘bout those 
Chiefs?’’ 
Thank you.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
BUDGET PROPOSAL 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today 
President Trump unveiled his budget 
proposal for fiscal year 2021. For the 
third year in a row, the President’s 
budget puts a magnifying glass on the 
endemic, pervasive hypocrisy of this 
administration. 
He says one thing in the State of the 
Union and does the opposite in his 
budget. But the budget is what he does. 
The State of the Union is just what he 
says. So, 1 week removed from the 
State of the Union Address, President 
Trump’s 
budget 
doublecrosses 
the 
American workers and middle-class 
families he promised to help in that 
speech. 
Let’s 
take 
healthcare. 
Candidate 
Trump promised to protect the social 
safety net programs like Medicare and 
Medicaid, unlike other Republicans. 
Once in office, President Trump has 
proposed 
cutting—cutting—Medicare 
and Medicaid every year he sent us a 
budget. Once again, the President pro-
posed steep cuts to Medicaid, as well as 
onerous 
new 
qualification 
require-
ments, policies that would take cov-
erage away from millions. 
Medicaid affects poor people, but it 
affects a whole lot of middle class peo-
ple whose parents are in nursing homes 
and healthcare facilities. Dramatic 
cuts to Medicaid hurt large, large num-
bers of Americans, both poor and mid-
dle class. 
On top of that, the budget proposes 
cutting funding for the Department of 
Health and Human Services by 9 per-
cent. That is the Department in charge 
of the coronavirus. He is cutting the 
budget. Then, when something bad hap-
pens, he will blame somebody else. 
That is his MO. 
The President stood in front of the 
Nation and promised his administra-
tion would protect Americans with pre-
existing conditions. It was a lie when 
he said it, and his budget makes that 
very, very clear. If the President’s 
budget became reality, hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars would be taken away 
from healthcare services, and tens of 
millions of Americans would see their 
coverage disappear, including millions 
with preexisting conditions. 
There is one term that appears no-
where in the President’s budget. It is 
called ‘‘climate change.’’ One of the 
greatest challenges of our time, the No. 
1 threat facing our planet, climate 
change is not mentioned once among 
the hundreds of pages of the Presi-
dent’s budget, except it does propose 
cutting the Environmental Protection 
Agency by 26 percent—more than a 
quarter. 
The Earth is on fire. Antarctica had 
a 64-degree record temperature this 
week. What is the President’s re-
sponse? He douses the fire with the 
lighter fluid of weakened pollution reg-
ulations and then proposes cutting the 
fire department. 
He cares about the oil companies. 
Lots of those Big Oil wildcatters send 
him tons of money. He doesn’t care

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S954 
February 10, 2020 
about the future of this globe and that 
we are leaving something awful to our 
children and grandchildren. 
Going further, in the President’s 
budget, hundreds of billions would be 
slashed from Federal housing assist-
ance, student loan forgiveness, and 
Federal disability insurance. Nutrition 
assistance to hungry families, long on 
the President’s chopping block, would 
see another round of severe cuts. 
Food—food for children. They are poor. 
Take it away. Is that what this coun-
try stands for? Is that what our Judeo- 
Christian tradition stands for? Abso-
lutely not. Absolutely not. 
If you are an American struggling 
with student loan debt or health prob-
lems or housing costs or hunger, the 
President’s budget says you are out of 
luck. Meanwhile, if you are a million-
aire or a billionaire or a corporation or 
a Big Oil wildcatter, the President’s 
budget says you are in luck. 
When it comes to taxes, the Presi-
dent thinks the tax cuts should be ex-
tended for an additional 10 years. So, 
so much for this deficit reduction that 
the Republican Party used to stand for. 
Now it is clear. A few years after the 
tax cuts—2 years after them—the def-
icit is increasing. It hasn’t produced 
that dramatic increase in revenues 
that everyone talked about. But let’s 
do it for 10 years. No Republican should 
complain to Democrats about deficit 
reduction when we are talking about 
things that matter to average middle- 
class people, like Medicare and Med-
icaid, when the tax cuts are proposed 
for 10 years. 
So the budget reveals once again 
where 
President 
Trump’s 
priorities 
truly lie: not with the working Ameri-
cans he touts in his speeches but with 
the ultrarich and the corporate elites 
he rewards with his policies. It can’t be 
discarded soon enough. 
One more point—I said it the night of 
the President’s State of the Union. I 
said the truth serum will be his budget. 
Let’s see if the President, for once, is 
telling a little bit of the truth. 
The budget shows all the rhetoric is 
one way, and the actual budget is an-
other. How long will the American peo-
ple stand for this man’s hypocrisy— 
blatant? I have never seen it in a Presi-
dent—Democrat or Republican—before. 
WHISTLEBLOWERS 
Mr. 
President, 
now, 
on 
whistle-
blowers, in the aftermath of the Presi-
dent’s impeachment trial, the Presi-
dent has begun dismissing members of 
the administration who testified in 
Congress, including Lieutenant Colonel 
Vindman and Ambassador Sondland. 
The President also dismissed LTC Eu-
gene Vindman. This was vindictive, 
nasty, typical of President Trump, and 
for no other reason than he was the 
brother of LTC Alexander Vindman. 
This morning, senior adviser to the 
President Kellyanne Conway said these 
were not likely the last of the firings. 
This is a textbook case of witness re-
taliation. Not only is the retaliation 
against Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, 
the anonymous whistleblower, and oth-
ers like them shameful; it is also ille-
gal. It is illegal. All Federal employees 
have the right—the legal right—to 
make protected disclosures to Congress 
and to inspectors general anonymously 
and free from reprisals. Even the 
Founding 
Fathers 
were 
concerned 
about whistleblowers and protecting 
them. 
This country is being turned inside 
out, and too many people are going 
along. If something is going on that is 
wrong in government, don’t we want to 
encourage government employees to 
bring that forward? Don’t we? Well, not 
President Trump, because he is the 
government, and what is good for 
him—or what he thinks is good for 
him—he thinks is good for America, 
even when they diverge. 
So the rights of whistleblowers are 
being challenged like never before, cre-
ating a chilling effect among those who 
in previous administrations might have 
come forward to expose abuses of 
power, 
waste, 
and 
fraud. 
Whistle-
blowers save the taxpayers money. 
Again, it used to be bipartisan. The 
Senator from Iowa has always been de-
fending whistleblowers, but all of that 
goes away now that Trump is Presi-
dent. Without the courage of whistle-
blowers and the role of inspectors gen-
eral, the American people would never 
have known how the President abused 
his power in Ukraine. 
Now the President is taking steps to 
punish anyone who came forward, out 
of spite and out of a desire to prevent 
future whistleblowers from potentially 
reporting 
on 
the 
President’s 
mis-
conduct. Make no mistake about it, the 
President is conducting a deliberate 
campaign to intimidate anyone who 
might blow the whistle on his conduct 
or the conduct of those under his direc-
tion. He feels this cannot be tolerated. 
So today I sent a letter to all 74 in-
spectors 
general 
in 
the 
executive 
branch, requesting that they imme-
diately investigate any and all in-
stances of retaliation against anyone 
who has made or in the future makes 
protected disclosures of Presidential 
misconduct to Congress or to an in-
spector general. 
Members of the administration take 
an oath to protect and defend the Con-
stitution. 
Some 
of 
them 
bravely 
stepped forward to tell the truth about 
the President’s efforts to solicit foreign 
interference in the 2020 elections, and 
for that, for telling the truth under 
oath—which the President didn’t allow 
his allies to do—for these people doing 
their patriotic duty to their country, 
they are being summarily dismissed 
from their jobs by a vindictive Presi-
dent. 
Our Founders believed that truth was 
fundamental to the government and, 
indeed, the survival of the Republic. As 
the President takes steps to punish 
anyone in his administration who tells 
the truth, it is incumbent on the inde-
pendent watchdogs in our government 
to protect whistleblowers like Lieuten-
ant Colonel Vindman and others who 
put their lives and livelihoods on the 
line to protect our freedoms. I was glad 
to hear the Chief of Staff say that 
Vindman, within the military, was pro-
tected. At least there is some honor 
left in this government. 
NOMINATION OF ANDREW LYNN BRASHER 
Mr. President, now, about the nomi-
nation of Mr. Brasher, now that the 
impeachment trial of the President is 
over, Leader MCCONNELL is wasting no 
time getting us back to what seems to 
be his primary goal: rubberstamping 
unqualified and extreme judicial nomi-
nations. 
This week the Senate will consider 
the nomination of Andrew Brasher to 
the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Mr. Brasher’s primary qualification to 
sit on the Federal bench seems to be 
the 61⁄2 months—61⁄2 months—he spent 
on the district court in Alabama. Let 
me repeat that. Senate Republicans in-
stalled Brasher as district court judge 
less than 7 months before moving to 
elevate him to an appellate court. I 
have never heard of anything like this. 
The Senate majority is asking us to 
promote a candidate for circuit court 
judgeship who has less than a year of 
experience as a judge. But he is not 
just unqualified. Maybe they are pro-
moting him so quickly because they 
love the fact that his views are so wild-
ly out of the mainstream. As Ala-
bama’s 
solicitor 
general, 
Brasher 
fought against women’s reproductive 
rights, which three-quarters of Ameri-
cans believe in; commonsense gun safe-
ty laws, which 90 percent of Americans 
believe in; and marriage equality, 
which the majority of Americans be-
lieve in. He employed farfetched legal 
theories that were overruled by the 
courts, including Justice Scalia. Mr. 
Brasher shamefully spent his career de-
fending voter suppression efforts. So 
less than 1 week after covering up the 
President’s attempt to cheat in the 
next election, Senate Republicans are 
moving forward to reward a nominee 
who supports voter suppression. Both 
actions smack of contempt for the 
democratic process and a blatant dis-
regard for the franchise of American 
citizens, the thing many of our young 
men and women have died for through-
out the century—the right to vote. 
Mr. Brasher’s nomination to the cir-
cuit court is another disgrace—an ab-
solute disgrace—to our Federal judici-
ary. Every Senator should vote against 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

lates that, in the Senate, the notifica-
tion of proposed sales shall be sent to 
the chairman of the Senate Foreign

In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S956 
February 10, 2020 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. 
Australia intends to use the missiles on its 
F–18 aircraft and will provide enhanced capa-
bilities in defense of critical sea-lanes. The 
proposed sale of the missiles and support will 
increase the Australian Navy’s maritime 
partnership potential and align its capabili-
ties with existing regional baselines. This is 
Australia’s first purchase of the missiles. 
Australia will not have any difficulty ab-
sorbing these weapons into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin, Orlando, Florida. There are no 
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require annual trips to Australia involving 
U.S. Government and contractor representa-
tives for technical reviews, support, and 
oversight for approximately five years. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AGM–158C, Long Range Anti-Ship 
Missile (LRASM) system is classified SE-
CRET. The LRASM is a non-nuclear tactical 
weapon system. It provides a day, night, and 
adverse weather, standoff air-to-surface ca-
pability and is an effective Anti-Surface 
Warfare missile. The LRASM incorporates 
components, software, and technical design 
information that are considered sensitive. 
The following components being conveyed by 
the proposed sale that are considered sen-
sitive include: 
a. RF Seeker. 
b. GPS/INS System. 
c. Datalink. 
d. Warhead. 
e. IR Seeker. 
2. These elements are essential to the abil-
ity of the LRASM missile to selectively en-
gage hostile targets under a wide range of 
operations, tactical and environmental con-
ditions. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures, which might reduce weapon sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Australia can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This proposed sale is necessary to fur-
ther the U.S. foreign policy and national se-
curity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed on 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Aus-
tralia.

TRANSMITTAL NO. 19–55 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Integrated Air Defense Weapon Sys-
tem (IADWS) is a System of Systems (SOS) 
consisting of the National Advanced Surface- 
to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), a Very 
Short Range Air Defense (VSHORAD) capa-
bility consisting of the Stinger FIM–92 Re-
programmable Micro-Processor (RMP) Block 
I missile, and small arms. The IADWS is de-
signed for mid-range air defense and can be 
deployed to engage fixed wing and rotary 
wing aircraft, cruise missiles, and unmanned 
aerial vehicles (UAVs). The IADWS is not a 
Program of Record (POR) for the U.S. De-
partment of Defense, but the SOS architec-
ture does consist of four PORs: The U.S. 
Army’s AN/MPQ–64 Sentinel radar, the U.S. 
Army’s FIM–92L Stinger Missile, U.S. Air 
Force’s Multi-Spectral Targeting System-A 
(MTS-A), and the U.S. Air Force’s AIM–120 
Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile 
(AMRAAM). The NASAMS is comprised of 
U.S. and Norwegian manufactured compo-
nents. Norwegian components will be pro-
cured by the Raytheon Company. Norwegian 
involvement will be managed by Raytheon 
using export authorizations received from 
the U.S. Department of State. 
2. The NASAMS Fire Unit (FU) consists of 
one fire distribution center (FDC), one AN/ 
MPQ–64Fl 
surveillance, 
acquisition, 
and 
tracking radar, 3 truck-mounted Canister 
Launchers (LCHR) and the High Mobility 
Launcher (HML) with 6 AMRAAM missiles 
each, and one truck-mounted Electrical Op-
tical/Infrared (EO/IR) Sensor System, the 
MTS-A, for visual target identification and 
raid size assessment. 
3. The command and control entity, FDC, 
is the major operator interface in NASAMS. 
It 
provides 
all 
command 
and 
control 
functionality necessary to effectively con-
duct Air Defense missions, both in a stand- 
alone (autonomous) configuration as well as 
in a netted configuration integrated to other 
units. The FDC interfaces and controls the 
MPQ–64Fl Sentinel radar, the MTS-A EO/IR 
Sensor and the Canister and High Mobility- 
Launchers. In addition, it interfaces and 
sends commands to any connected Very 
Short Range Air Defense (VSHORAD) Sting-
er platforms. The FDC also interfaces (voice 
and data) to the national command and con-
trol structure. 
4. The AN/MPQ–64Fl Sentinel Radar is the 
organic mobile Air Defense acquisition and 
tracking sensor for the United States Army. 
Sentinel provides persistent air surveillance 
and fire control quality data through com-
mand and control systems to defeat Un-
manned Aerial System (UAS), cruise mis-
siles, and fixed-wind and rotary-wing aircraft 
threats. 
5. The purpose of the Canister Launcher 
(LCHR) and the High Mobility Launcher 
(HML) is to transport, aim, and fire the 
AMRAAM missiles. Under the remote con-
trol of the Fire Distribution Center (FDC), 
the LCHR/HML permits rapid launching of 
one or more missiles against single or mul-
tiple targets. The LCHR/HML provides 360- 
degree, all weather, day and night, missile 
launch capability. 
6. The AN/AAS–52 and AN/AAS–44C(V) 
Multi-Spectral Targeting System–A (MTS– 
A) is a multi-use infrared (IR), electro opti-
cal (EO), and laser detecting ranging-track-
ing set originally developed and produced for 
use by airborne platforms. This advanced EO 
and IR system provides long-range surveil-
lance, target acquisition, target tracking, 
range finding, and laser designation. It has 
been adapted for towers, aerostats, and 
ground based applications. 
7. The AIM–120C–7/C–8 Advanced Medium 
Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) is a su-
personic, aerial intercept, guided missile fea-
turing digital technology and micro-minia-
ture solid-state electronics that is also able 
to operate as a ground-based air defense mis-
sile capable in all-weather against multiple 
targets in a sophisticated electronic attack 
resistance to electronic countermeasure, and 
interception of high- and low-flying maneu-
vering targets. The AIM–120C–8 is a form, fit, 
function refresh of the AIM–120C–7 and is the 
next generation to be produced. 
8. The VSHORAD system consists of the 
four Dual Mount Stinger (DMS) systems, two 
Rapid Ranger (RR) Stinger Mobile Inte-
grated Defense Systems, and the Stinger 92L 
Reprogrammable 
Micro-Processor 
(RMP) 
Block I missile. 
9. The Stinger 92L Reprogrammable Micro- 
Processor (RMP) Block I missile is an infra-
red homing surface-to-air missile that can be 
adapted to fire from a wide variety of ground 
vehicles. 
10. The DMS System provides a man-trans-
portable pedestal system that can be used 
day or night in any environment. The DMS 
fires two Stinger missiles, and includes fully 
integrated day/night sights with optical 
zoom capability. Included as part of the DMS 
is a ruggedized tablet from which video out-
put from the visible band day-sight, IR scene 
from the night-sight, and target cueing data 
are integrated. Slew-to-cue- information pro-
vides guidance to the gunner for target selec-
tion. The OMS can interface with the 
NASAMS FDC for Target Designation and 
Target Engagement Authorization as well as 
autonomous operation. 
11. The Rapid Ranger (RR) consists of a 
High Mobility Vehicle operated by a crew of 
three. The RR is integrated by Raytheon 
with two Stinger Vehicle Universal Launch-
ers (SVULs), a Fire Control System (FCS), 
and a Command, Control and Communica-
tions (C3) System. The RR can interface with 
NASAMS FDC for Target Designation and 
Target Engagement Authorization as well as 
autonomous operation. 
12. This sale is necessary in furtherance of 
the U.S. foreign policy and national security 
objectives outlined in the Policy Justifica-
tion. Moreover, the benefits to be derived 
from this sale, as outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification, outweigh the potential damage 
that could result if the sensitive technology 
were revealed to unauthorized persons. 
13. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal have been authorized for 
release and export to the Government of 
India.

IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today following Sen-
ate acquittal in the impeachment trial 
of President Trump. 
After a 2-week trial, the U.S. Senate 
has delivered impartial justice. Make 
no mistake: Senate acquittal is the 
final judgment, forever clearing Presi-
dent Trump. 
The House clearly made serious mis-
takes. Never before has a President 
been impeached with no underlying 
crime, no defense counsel, and not a 
single Republican vote. It was purely 
partisan and totally political. 
The House overstepped its authority. 
The Senate, however, according to the 
Constitution, has the final word. The 
Senate followed the law. The Senate 
held a fair trial. We used the bipartisan 
Clinton trial format. These rules en-
sured both sides full and equal time. 
Let’s not forget: In the House, the 
President’s rights were ignored. He had 
no voice, no due process, no defense. 
The Senate allowed the President to 
defend himself, and his defense team 
presented a fact-based case. White 
House lawyers detailed the President’s 
legitimate, long-held concerns over 
Ukraine corruption. The President’s 
legal team made a strong case against 
the House impeachment articles. 
House managers, meanwhile, failed 
to prove their case. Rather than focus 
on facts, they appeared to be playing to 
the cameras. Incredibly, House man-
agers attacked the Senate jury, accus-
ing Republicans of ‘‘corruption’’ and 
‘‘cover-up.’’ House managers played for 
time, repeating speeches, demanding 
more witnesses we didn’t need. In re-
ality, it was a weak case. There were 
no offenses that rose to the Constitu-
tion’s requirement of ‘‘Treason, Brib-
ery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors.’’ 
The House process was one-sided 
from the start. For political purposes, 
Speaker PELOSI rushed the impeach-
ment vote by Christmas, claiming ur-
gency. Then her sense of urgency dis-
appeared. She proceeded to delay the 
Senate trial for 4 weeks. The Speaker 
waited 33 days to send us the Articles 
of Impeachment. This begs the ques-
tion: Why delay the removal of a Presi-
dent the Democrats in the House claim 
is ‘‘dangerous’’? 
Still, the Speaker insisted this spec-
tacle was ‘‘solemn,’’ even prayerful. 
Then came her strangely irreverent 
signing ceremony. Nothing says solemn 
like souvenir signing pens. 
The bottom line is: Partisan im-
peachment is poison—poison—for our 
democracy. Senate acquittal is the 
antidote. Impeachment has hurt and 
divided this country. It has also de-
layed important work on behalf of the 
American people. Congress needs to 
now come together and move forward. 
Look at the incredible results we are 
already seeing under this President. 
Thanks to tax and regulatory relief, 
our economy is booming. American 
workers are winning. 
We are seeing record job growth: 7 
million new jobs, 500,000 new manufac-
turing jobs, and 50-year-low unemploy-
ment. 
Middle-class 
and 
blue-collar 
wages are rising. Household wealth is 
soaring. Consumer confidence is at 
record highs. Add to that the Presi-
dent’s America-first trade deals. The

U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal, deals with 
China, Japan, they are a boon for our 
farmers and for our workers. What is 
more, we have unleashed American en-
ergy. The U.S. is now No. 1 in oil and 
in natural gas. We no longer need Mid-
dle East oil. We have also confirmed 187 
highly qualified Federal judges. Above 
all, we are keeping the country safe 
and secure. President Trump has com-
pletely rebuilt our military. 
Yet 
partisan 
impeachment 
has 
blocked progress. Congress has learned 
its lesson: Impeachment, if it is to ever 
happen again, must be bipartisan, fair, 
and rare. Senate acquittal is the final 
judgment. 
Now, we are back to work for the 
American people. We are looking for-
ward to the important work ahead, to 
continuing our progress on priorities 
like lowering prescription drug costs, 
securing our border, and fixing our 
aging roads and bridges. 
The 2020 Presidential election is fast 
approaching. In fact, voting has al-
ready occurred in Iowa. It is time for 
the American people to decide who 
serves as President. It is time for Con-
gress to get back to work. Thank you. 
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, on 
Wednesday, I voted against convicting 
President Trump of the two Articles of 
Impeachment. The Senate has spent 
the last 3 weeks in a Presidential im-
peachment trial for only the third time 
in our Nation’s 244-year history. ADAM 
SCHIFF and House Democrats demanded 
that the Senate overturn the results of 
the 2016 Presidential election, remove 
President Trump from office, and take 
him off the 2020 ballot. These outcomes 
would be deeply disruptive to the func-
tioning of our government, would fur-
ther divide our Nation, and would pre-
vent the American people from decid-
ing who their President should be at 
the ballot box. The American people 
collectively are better fit to judge Don-
ald Trump’s Presidency as a whole 
than the partisan politicians in Wash-
ington who brought forth this impeach-
ment. Despite the celebrations by 
NANCY PELOSI and House Democrats, 
this is a grave and serious matter with 
implications far beyond this President, 
this Congress, and this generation. 
During the trial, I have remained 
committed to my oath to administer 
impartial justice with the same seri-
ousness as my oath to protect the Con-
stitution that I put my life on the line 
for in uniform. I listened carefully to 
the presentations by both the House 
managers and the President’s counsel. 
I researched the law, reviewed histor-
ical precedents, and asked questions. I 
discussed the evidence and the issues 
with colleagues, and I came to my own 
conclusion. 
The text, history, and purpose of the 
Constitution support acquittal. Our 
founding document gives the House the 
sole power of impeachment and the 
Senate the sole power to try all im-
peachments. Further, it requires a two- 
thirds vote to convict and remove any 
President. The Founding Fathers were 
concerned that impeachment would be 
frequently used as a partisan political 
weapon. Because of this concern, they 
deliberated whether to include Presi-
dential impeachment at all. Then, they 
considered the scope of the offenses 
subject to the grievous, divisive, and 
disruptive punishment of decapitating 
one branch of our government. At the 
constitutional convention, the Found-
ers rejected vague, standard-less terms 
like ‘‘malpractice,’’ ‘‘neglect of duty,’’ 
and ‘‘maladministration.’’ James Madi-
son, the father of our Constitution, ob-
jected that vague terms would be 
‘‘equivalent to a tenure during the 
pleasure of the Senate.’’ Madison’s 
view prevailed, and the framers settled 
on ‘‘treason, bribery, or other high 
crimes and misdemeanors’’ to mini-
mize the risk of partisan abuse of im-
peachment. 
Madison and the other Founders in-
tended impeachment to be an ex-
tremely disruptive last resort to save 
the Republic. What our constitutional 
text and tradition teach us is that no 
President should be impeached and re-
moved from office without the support 
of both parties and the American peo-
ple. The reason that President Andrew 
Johnson avoided conviction in his trial 
was that a mixed group of both Demo-
crats and Republicans voted to find the 
President not guilty. Richard Nixon’s 
impeachment inquiry vote passed the 
House 410 to 4. Senator CHUCK SCHUMER 
and Speaker NANCY
PELOSI
used to 
agree. ‘‘I expect history will show that 
we’ve lowered the bar on impeachment 
so much, we’ve broken the seal on this 
extreme penalty so cavalierly—that it 
will be used as a routine tool to fight 
political battles,’’ SCHUMER
said in 
1998. ‘‘My fear is that when a Repub-
lican wins the White House, Democrats 
will 
demand 
payback.’’ 
Likewise, 
Speaker PELOSI
stated last March: 
‘‘Impeachment is so divisive to the 
country that unless there’s something 
so compelling and overwhelming and 
bipartisan, I don’t think we should go 
down that path because it divides the 
country.’’ Before a few months ago, the 
consensus—articulated well by Senator 
SCHUMER and Speaker PELOSI, was that 
a partisan impeachment is not a proper 
impeachment. 
The first Article of Impeachment for 
‘‘abuse of power’’ does not warrant re-
moval from office and the ballot. The 
President is not perfect, and the way in 
which he evidently attempted to ad-
dress his legitimate concerns about 
corruption involving the Bidens was in-
appropriate. But even if all that the 
House Democrats allege in fact oc-
curred, even if John Bolton supports 
their allegations in his book, even if 
other negative information comes out 
in the future, this does not rise any-
where near the level of throwing the 
President out of office or off the ballot 
for the first time in American history. 
Abuse of power is a vague offense that 
the House managers have failed to de-
fine with precision, but even accepting 
all the House managers’ facts as true, 
the alleged conduct does not justify 
conviction. 
The second Article of Impeachment 
for ‘‘obstruction of Congress’’ is frivo-
lous and dangerous for the separation 
of powers that is foundational to our 
Republic. Presidential clashes with 
Congress are not just routine but are 
baked into our constitutional DNA. 
The separation of powers painstakingly 
negotiated by our Founders is work-
ing—and that is a positive thing. The 
Framers designed tension between the 
coequal 
executive 
and 
legislative 
branches of our government. Congress 
often wants access to everyone and ev-
erything in the executive branch. The 
executive branch, in contrast, has le-
gitimate grounds to prevent certain ad-
visors or documents from being hauled 
before Congress. This article, if legiti-
mized, would cede unprecedented power 
to one Chamber and would permit the 
House to remove a President from of-
fice any time that it does not get what 
it wants from the President, exactly as 
James Madison feared. 
Not only do the two articles fail, but 
I also cannot in good conscience vote 
to convict because every step of this 
slapdash 
impeachment 
process 
has 
been characterized by a lack of funda-
mental fairness. I am troubled by the 
speed and cheerful eagerness with 
which the House Democrats railroaded 
through their investigation and vote 
on the articles. Unlike the Nixon and 
Clinton impeachments, the investiga-
tion into the alleged wrongdoing was 
hastily conducted and sloppily exe-
cuted. The House Democrats made it 
clear that their objective was to im-
peach the President by Christmas, and 
they trampled over fairness and well- 
established legal processes on the way. 
After initially failing to vote to au-
thorize the inquiry, they went from a 
vote authorizing an inquiry to im-
peaching the President in just 48 days. 
What is more, the House Intelligence 
Committee failed to afford the Presi-
dent with procedural rights. The House 
should have voted to authorize the im-
peachment before investigating and 
should have attempted the usual ac-
commodation process to resolve the 
tensions with the executive branch. 
The fundamentals of due process also 
include the right to have counsel 
present during interviews with inves-
tigators, the right to cross-examine 
witnesses, the right to call your own 
witnesses, and the right to submit evi-
dence. Here, House Democrats called 
only their preferred witnesses, and 
they denied President Trump’s counsel 
the opportunity to be present for ex-
aminations. The Democrats conducting 
the investigation also failed to sub-
poena individuals whom they now 
claim are key witnesses. If ADAM 
SCHIFF genuinely wanted to hear from 
John Bolton, he should have subpoe-
naed him, should have allowed the 
President to assert immunity, and 
should have gone to the courts to sort 
out the competing claims. But that 
wouldn’t have fit the House Democrats’ 
rushed timeline or narrative.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S959 
February 10, 2020 
Once the process was handed over to 
the House Judiciary Committee, House 
Democrats had a single hearing with 
law professors on December 4 before 
announcing on December 5 that they 
were committed to drafting Articles of 
Impeachment. 
The 
committee 
ap-
proved the articles on December 13. To 
put this in perspective, this meant that 
the relevant committee spent 1 week 
drafting the articles before Speaker 
PELOSI spent 4 weeks sitting on the ar-
ticles. And on the Senate side, I am 
likewise concerned that ADAM SCHIFF, 
House Democrats, and CHUCK SCHUMER 
demanded that the Senate do the 
House’s job and clean up the House’s 
shoddy work. Democrats have insisted 
that the Senate subpoena witnesses 
that the House refused to call and that 
the Senate shut itself down for weeks 
or months to allow for an investigation 
that the House should have conducted 
before proceeding to a final impeach-
ment 
vote. 
The 
House 
Democrats 
showed testimony of 13 witnesses dur-
ing the trial and submitted 28,000 pages 
of documents. Having repeatedly stated 
that their evidence was overwhelming, 
they then claimed that they needed 
more witnesses and documents to make 
their case. You can’t have it both ways. 
I am particularly troubled that in 
the Senate, the House managers sought 
to have the Senate address issues of ex-
ecutive privilege in a way that it has 
never done before. Executive privilege 
is a right—asserted by all Presidents of 
different parties for decades—to pre-
vent close advisers from divulging con-
fidential communications. But now, for 
the first time in our Nation’s history, 
the Democrats sought to have the Sen-
ate displace the judiciary and resolve, 
by majority vote, highly complicated 
questions on executive privilege—a 
task that would raise substantial con-
stitutional and institutional questions. 
Even more disturbing was the House 
and Senate Democrats’ casual attempt 
to drag the Chief Justice of the Su-
preme Court into this process. With a 
straight face, ADAM SCHIFF repeatedly 
called for the Chief Justice to be the 
decisionmaker on serious and complex 
issues, as if attempting to remove a 
President and adjust the relationship 
between the House and the Senate for-
ever weren’t enough. On top of this, 
Democrats tried to bring the third 
branch of government into this par-
tisan political exercise with no concern 
for the seismic implications for our Re-
public. 
Although my vote against convicting 
President Trump lies with the failure 
of House Democrats to prove impeach-
able conduct, I would be remiss if I did 
not emphasize one crucial fact: The 
historical record is clear that Presi-
dent Obama was weak on Russia and 
trivialized 
the 
geopolitical 
threat 
posed by Putin. In 2009, Obama’s Sec-
retary of State presented the Russian 
Foreign Minister with a ‘‘reset’’ but-
ton, grinning alongside him in a photo 
opportunity. 
That 
year, 
President 
Obama, at Russia’s request, cancelled 
plans to build a missile defense system 
in Eastern Europe. In 2011, an open 
microphone caught Obama telling Rus-
sian President Medvedev that he would 
‘‘have more flexibility’’ with easing 
pressure on Russia—‘‘particularly with 
missile 
defense’’—after 
the 
Presi-
dential election. During the 2012 elec-
tion, President Obama mocked his op-
ponent for expressing geopolitical con-
cern about Russia. ‘‘The 1980s are now 
calling to ask for their foreign policy 
back,’’ Obama said. Two years later, 
Russia annexed Crimea and then in-
vaded eastern Ukraine. Obama refused 
to provide lethal aid to Ukraine to de-
fend itself and his policies toward Rus-
sia were a national security disaster. 
In contrast, President Trump has 
placed 
unprecedented 
sanctions 
on 
Russia and provided lethal weapons 
like the Javelin anti-tank missile to 
Ukraine to defend itself. Several of the 
House managers who attempted to re-
move President Trump for a minor 
delay in security-assistance funding, 
which was separate from the Javelin 
missile purchases, voted against pro-
viding lethal aid to Ukraine in mul-
tiple defense authorization and funding 
bills. 
Should 
we 
have 
impeached 
Obama for not providing lethal aid to 
Ukraine? No. It was bad policy and 
weak compared to what Trump has 
done but not impeachable. 
This Presidential impeachment is 
historic for dangerous reasons. It is the 
first partisan House impeachment with 
bipartisan opposition. It is the first to 
deny procedural fairness protections to 
the President during the House in-
quiry. It is disturbing because this en-
tire matter should have been handled 
via the normal oversight processes 
available to Congress with subpoena 
disputes resolved in the courts. 
With all the above in mind, I con-
clude that the President did not engage 
in conduct rising to the level of trea-
son, bribery, or other high crimes and 
misdemeanors. Democrats have been 
trying to impeach President Trump re-
peatedly since he was elected. They 
filed eight impeachment resolutions 
for everything from undermining the 
freedom of the press to using insulting 
language. 
Our country has a Presidential elec-
tion in 9 months, with the first votes in 
Iowa already completed. The American 
people deserve to be represented by the 
President they elected. They also de-
serve to choose who is the President 
for the next 4 years. While I have con-
cerns about the upcoming 9 months, I 
am likewise concerned about the next 
90 years. Looking at the process that 
unfolded in the House and the constitu-
tional contortionism that the Demo-
crats displayed in the Senate, it would 
be a dangerous precedent to normalize 
how House Democrats have carried out 
this process. If rewarded, this prece-
dent would trivialize impeachment, 
distort the relationship between the 
two Chambers, and forever alter the re-
lationship among the three branches. 
In the future, any House controlled by 
the opposite party of the President 
could trample on due process, ram 
through an unfair impeachment for 
vague accusations, and demand that 
the Senate shut down its legislative 
work to investigate on behalf of the 
House. No future House of Representa-
tives run by Democrats or Republicans 
should take this path. 
I have heard it said repeatedly 
throughout this trial that Benjamin 
Franklin left Americans ‘‘a Republic— 
if you can keep it.’’ I vote to keep it.

TRIBUTE TO JACQUELINE 
WICECARVER 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, it is 
my honor to pay tribute to an excep-
tional leader and member of the Senior 
Executive Service of the Department of 
Defense Office of Inspector General, 
Ms. Jacqueline Wicecarver. 
A native of Rector, AR, Jackie joined 
the Department of Defense in 1978 as a 
member of the U.S. Army Materiel 
Command in Rock Island, IL. Within 
the next 10 years, Jackie and her fam-
ily moved five times. During this time, 
Jackie held a variety of positions with-
in the Department of Defense and re-
ceived high praise in each position for 
her 
exceptional 
level 
of 
profes-
sionalism, dedication to duty, and out-
standing contributions to the mission. 
In 1990, Jackie joined the Department 
of Defense Office of Inspector General 
as a staff auditor and rose through the 
ranks, joining the Senior Executive 
Service as the Assistant Inspector Gen-
eral for Acquisition and Contract Man-
agement in 2011. In January 2017, she 
was selected to lead nearly 600 auditors 
and support personnel as the Deputy 
Inspector General for Audit. 
In her role as the Deputy Inspector 
General for Audit, Jackie has provided 
guidance, counsel, and mentorship to 
many auditors as they worked to com-
plete more than 320 audit reports that 
identified over $7 billion in potential 
savings to the Department of Defense. 
Most significantly, under Jackie’s di-
rection, the Office of Inspector General 
completed two full financial statement 
audits of the Department of Defense. 
These financial statement audits have 
been described as the largest in his-
tory. 
Jackie has been honored with the De-
partment of Defense Inspector General 
Medal for Distinguished Civilian Serv-
ice Award, the Meritorious Civilian 
Service Award, and the President’s 
Council on Integrity and Efficiency 
Award. 
Jackie has served her country for 
more than 40 years as a Department of 
Defense civilian. On behalf of the Sen-
ate, I thank Jackie and her family—her 
husband James of 50 years, their chil-
dren Christopher and Jennifer and four 
grandchildren, Caitlyn, Wade, Tate and 
Quinn—for their continued commit-
ment and sacrifice in service to our Na-
tion. I wish her future success as she 
transitions into retirement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S960 
February 10, 2020 
TRIBUTE TO DR. WALLY 
COVINGTON 
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize one of the most in-
fluential and well-known forest ecolo-
gists in the Nation, Dr. Wally Cov-
ington of Flagstaff, AZ. 
Last month, Dr. Covington retired 
from his current position as regents’ 
professor at the School of Forestry and 
the executive director of the Ecological 
Restoration Institute at Northern Ari-
zona University. 
When we talk about the wildfire cri-
sis afflicting the West, we frequently 
reference the need to thin our forests 
of the enormous number of small, dead, 
and dying trees that have fueled some 
of largest, deadliest, and most destruc-
tive mega fires ever seen in the United 
States. 
In my home State of Arizona, about 
one-quarter of our pine forests have 
been impacted by fire over the past two 
decades. In 2011, the largest wildfire in 
State history, the Wallow Fire, incin-
erated over a half million acres in a 
matter of weeks before finally burning 
out. And a nation mourned the loss of 
19 brave wildland firefighters from 
Prescott, AZ, who gave their lives bat-
tling the Yarnell Hill Fire in 2013. 
These fires burn so hot and fast that 
they barrel through rural commu-
nities, insatiably consuming property 
in its path and, sometimes, human life 
too. 
We recognize that the fuel load is too 
high in many forests and that pre-
scribed fires and fuel breaks alone are 
not enough to prevent mega-fires that 
crown atop forest canopies. 
Today, it is common sense that our 
fire-prone public lands need to be re-
stored to their natural, fire-adapted 
state. It is difficult to imagine how 
this conventional wisdom shared across 
both sides of the aisle, and among the 
timber industry and environmental 
groups alike, was foreign, controver-
sial, and, frankly, heretical only two 
decades ago. It was Dr. Covington’s ap-
plied research in forest ecology and his 
tireless advocacy that showed us how 
reducing tree density through timber 
harvesting is not only beneficial, but 
also necessary if we want to reduce the 
threat of catastrophic wildfires. 
So 
when 
we 
talk 
about 
forest 
thinning, the country should know just 
how influential Dr. Wally Covington’s 
contributions were to the practice of 
forest ecosystem restoration. 
Let me share a little bit of Dr. Cov-
ington’s story with you. From a young 
age, Wally was exposed to the wonders 
of the great outdoors by his parents 
who first met and fell in love in Flag-
staff. They instilled in him a profound 
appreciation for nature and a humbling 
perspective on humanity’s impact on 
the land. At his father’s urging, Wally 
studied the works of conservationist 
Aldo Leopold, who is regarded as the 
founder of the wilderness preservation 
movement and the philosophy of ‘‘land 
ethics,’’ which espouses the belief that 
man is not a conqueror of his environ-
ment, but a unique component of it. 
Later, Wally graduated from the Uni-
versity of North Texas with a degree in 
biology, and he planned to become a 
physician in pediatric oncology. How-
ever, the emotional toll of working 
with children with cancer left Wally 
disheartened. 
He 
departed 
medical 
school never to return. Still, that 
heart-wrenching 
experience 
taught 
Wally that he was a healer. 
Shaped by the burgeoning environ-
mental movement of the 1970s, Wally 
answered another calling. He decided 
to pursue a master’s in ecology from 
the University of New Mexico. It 
wasn’t long before Wally’s academic 
achievements led him to Yale Univer-
sity where he earned a doctorate in for-
estry in 1976. 
Dr. Covington was already an accom-
plished forest ecologist by the time he 
joined NAU. At Yale, he developed an 
innovative theory for predicting the 
carbon budgets of unharvested forests, 
a calculation known as ‘‘Covington’s 
curve’’ that is still widely used in mod-
ern forestry. 
His 
next 
achievement, 
however, 
would transform how we view and man-
age our forestlands. For some time, 
Wally had been studying ponderosa 
pine trees, a type of evergreen species 
that dominates the landscape in the 
West. These iconic conifers span more 
than 27 million acres in the United 
States. Wally observed that our Na-
tion’s pine forests were out of balance, 
unhealthy, and highly susceptible to 
drought, insect infestation, and dis-
ease. A majority of the mega-fires or 
‘‘conflagrations’’ impacting northern 
California, Montana, Arizona, and else-
where were occurring in ponderosa pine 
forests. 
As a forest ecologist, Wally under-
stood that fire plays a natural role in 
our forests. Historically, in North 
America, low intensity ground fire led 
to large, mature pine trees and forests 
that are naturally adapted to with-
stand fire. But modern wildfires in the 
West were now burning with such fero-
cious intensity that even the sturdiest 
of pine trees would literally boil to the 
point of exploding. Postfire conditions 
were no longer the regenerative force 
that ecologists had once studied. Soils 
were damaged, taking years to replen-
ish their nutrients, and watersheds 
were more likely to experience long- 
term flooding and erosion. 
Wally once poignantly described the 
situation in an article he authored in 
the journal Nature in 2002: ‘‘The dry 
forest ecosystems of the American 
West, especially those once dominated 
by open ponderosa pine forests, are in 
widespread collapse. We are now wit-
nessing sudden leaps in aberrant eco-
system behavior long predicted by 
ecologists 
and 
conservation 
profes-
sionals. Trends over the past half-cen-
tury show that the frequency, intensity 
and size of wildfires will increase—by 
orders of magnitude—the loss of bio-
logical diversity, property and human 
lives for many generations to come.’’ 
Like any good healer, Dr. Covington 
worked tirelessly to diagnose the ill-
ness and devise a cure. As part of his 
research, Wally pored through histor-
ical records, old photographs, and land 
surveys dating back to the turn of the 
century. He listened to Native Amer-
ican Tribal members, the first inhab-
itants of our forests, who shared stories 
told and retold through the genera-
tions about elk and deer hunts in open 
canopied forests teeming with bounti-
ful grasslands. Wally discovered that, 
in a very short time, about 50 years, 
the forest landscape of the West had 
substantially changed. 
He 
hypothesized, 
correctly, 
that 
man’s presence had transformed our 
once fire-adapted, low-density forests 
into overstocked tinderboxes. Before 
there was a Forest Service, before 
westward expansion brought pioneers 
and homesteaders, the land, he esti-
mated, supported around 50 to 100 pine 
trees per acre. In contrast, today’s 
modern forests host roughly 300 per-
cent more trees—sometimes as much 
as 1,000 trees per acre—a number far 
greater than the natural ecosystem can 
support. This meant that the West was 
overloaded with a dangerous amount of 
kindling fuel. 
To prove his theory, Wally ran ex-
periments. Beginning in 1992, on a mod-
est 10-acre parcel of Forest Service 
land in the Gus Pearson Natural Area, 
Wally established three test plots. The 
first plot was used as the control, its 
post-settlement state preserved as-is. 
The second plot was thinned of excess 
pine trees. On the third plot, the trees 
were thinned to simulate pre-settle-
ment conditions and then subjected to 
prescribed fire, the kind of controlled 
burns routinely used by the Forest 
Service to clear our low-lying fuels 
from the forest floor. 
His test showed that fire behavior 
dramatically decreased on the plot 
that was thinned. Trees didn’t suffer 
the same trauma found on the other 
two plots and in fact responded posi-
tively by producing increased resin, 
which meant increased resistance to 
bark beetle infestation. Also, the num-
ber of species and amount of native 
grasses and plants increased improving 
both forage and habitat quality. Wally 
had successfully conducted the first 
science-based forest restoration project 
in history. 
Dr. Covington took his findings to 
Congress, the Department of the Inte-
rior, the Forest Service, and the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences. He met 
with Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt 
under the Clinton administration and, 
later, Secretary Gale Norton under the 
George W. Bush administration, to con-
vince them to implement forest res-
toration treatments. In many of his 
meetings, he would echo the old adage, 
‘‘an ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cure.’’ 
They listened, and Congress listened, 
as did my Arizona predecessors in the 
Senate. In 2003, he worked with Sen-
ator Jon Kyl to enact legislation like 
the Health Forests Restoration Act 
and also established the congression-
ally chartered Southwest Ecological

Restoration Institutes at NAU, Colo-
rado State University, and New Mexico 
Highlands University, which assist the 
Forest Service in developing restora-
tion projects across millions of acres of 
land. 
Today, the Forest Service and the 
Department of the Interior are working 
to mechanically thin millions of acres 
of forestlands across the West to make 
our forests more resilient to fire. It is 
a slow, expensive, and time-consuming 
prospect to reverse 50 years of forest 
mismanagement across a territory as 
vast as the United States, but the re-
ward is worth it. In doing so, we are 
saving our forests, our homes, and 
human lives. 
I cannot overstate Dr. Covington’s 
tremendous contribution to the field of 
forest ecology. Had it not been for Wal-
ly’s work, his compassion for healing 
our unhealthy forests, and his drive to 
educate policymakers on the sound 
science behind forest restoration, I sus-
pect our forests would be in far worse 
shape today. I am proud to recognize 
Dr. Covington, a fellow Arizonan. Our 
Nation owes Wally a debt of gratitude 
that we can never repay.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO RYAN MICOZZI 
∑ Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
would like to take the opportunity to 
express my appreciation to Ryan for 
his hard work as an intern in the Sen-
ate Republican Conference. I recognize 
his efforts and contributions to my of-
fice, as well as to the State of Wyo-
ming. 
Ryan is a native of New York. He is 
a graduate of the University of Buffalo, 
where he studied political science and 
business administration: human re-
sources. He has demonstrated a strong 
work ethic, which has made him an in-
valuable asset to our office. The qual-
ity of his work is reflected in his great 
efforts over the last several months. 
I want to thank Ryan for the dedica-
tion he has shown while working for 
me and my staff. It is a pleasure to 
have him as part of our team. I know 
he will have continued success with all 
of his future endeavors. I wish him all 
my best on his journey.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JOHN FERRIOLA 
∑ Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the career and serv-
ice of John Ferriola, who will retire at 
the end of this year after serving Nucor 
Steel for nearly three decades. Mr. 
Ferriola has served as CEO since 2013, 
and under his leadership, the company 
has grown and created thousands of 
good-paying manufacturing jobs here 
in the U.S. He worked to upgrade 
Nucor’s facility in Marion, OH, with a 
new rolling mill that began operating 
this year. 
John has been a passionate advocate 
for American manufacturing and for a 
fairer trade policy that works for 
American workers and businesses. We 
worked together to pass the Leveling 
the Playing Field Act in 2015, the first 
strengthening of our trade remedy laws 
in more than two decades. That law 
has helped us win key trade cases for 
Ohio steel companies over the past 4 
years. 
When John started at Nucor in 1991, 
it was a small steel company with just 
two mills. Last year, Nucor was the 
largest steel producer in the United 
States. John understands that workers 
in Ohio and around the U.S. are the en-
gine behind that success. I look for-
ward to continuing to our fight to-
gether for a fair trade policy that puts 
American workers first, and I wish 
John Ferriola all the best in his retire-
ment.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT RELATIVE TO AN ALTER-
NATIVE PLAN FOR PAY ADJUST-
MENTS FOR CIVILIAN FEDERAL 
EMPLOYEES COVERED BY THE 
GENERAL SCHEDULE AND CER-
TAIN OTHER PAY SYSTEMS IN 
JANUARY 2021—PM 44 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
I am transmitting an alternative 
plan for pay adjustments for civilian 
Federal employees covered by the Gen-
eral Schedule and certain other pay 
systems in January 2021. 
Title 5, United States Code, author-
izes me to implement alternative plans 
for pay adjustments for civilian Fed-
eral employees covered by the General 
Schedule and certain other pay sys-
tems if, because of ‘‘national emer-
gency or serious economic conditions 
affecting the general welfare,’’ I view 
the increases that would otherwise 
take effect as inappropriate. 
Under current law, locality pay in-
creases averaging 20.67 percent, costing 
$21 billion in the first year alone, 
would go into effect in January 2021, in 
addition to a 2.5 percent across-the- 
board increase for the base General 
Schedule. 
We must maintain efforts to put our 
Nation on a fiscally sustainable course; 
Federal agency budgets cannot sustain 
such increases. Accordingly, I have de-
termined that it is appropriate to exer-
cise my authority to set alternative 
pay adjustments for 2021 pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 5303(b) and 5 U.S.C. 5304a. 
Specifically, I have determined that 
for 2021 the across-the-board base pay 
increase will be limited to 1.0 percent 
and locality pay percentages will re-
main at their 2020 levels. This alter-
native pay plan decision will not mate-
rially affect our ability to attract and 
retain a well-qualified Federal work-
force. 
As noted in my Budget for Fiscal 
Year 2021, our pay system must reform 
to align with mission-critical recruit-
ment and retention goals, and to re-
ward employees whose performance 
provides value for the American peo-
ple. 
For this purpose, my Budget further 
directs agencies to increase awards 
spending in FY 2021 by an amount 
equal to no less than 1 percent of total 
salary spending. My Administration 
will continue to support reforms that 
advance these aims. 
The adjustment described above shall 
take effect on the first day of the first 
applicable pay period beginning on or 
after January 1, 2021. 
DONALD J. TRUMP.

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES 
GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 
2021—PM 45 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred jointly, pur-
suant to the order of January 30, 1975, 
as modified by the order of April 11, 
1986; to the Committees on Appropria-
tions; and the Budget: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Over the past 3 years, my Adminis-
tration has worked tirelessly to restore 
America’s economic strength. We have 
ended the war on American workers 
and stopped the assault on American 
industry, launching an economic boom 
the likes of which we have never seen 
before. 
While our incredible economic turn-
around came as a shock to most career 
politicians in Washington, it is no sur-
prise to millions of hard-working fami-
lies across the Nation. Their natural 
talent, ingenuity, and strength simply 
needed an opportunity to flourish, free 
from the massive regulations and taxes 
heaped upon them by their Govern-
ment. 
As my Administration continues to 
remove these burdens, our economy 
continues to surpass expectations. We 
are growing faster than the experts 
thought possible. The unemployment 
rate is at 3.5 percent, the lowest it has 
been in 50 years. And more Americans 
are working today than at any point in 
our history. 
Today’s tremendous job market is 
leading employers to realize the vast 
potential of many individuals they pre-
viously overlooked. Over the past 3

February 10, 2020 
years, the employment rate of our 
prime-age workers has skyrocketed, 
and wages are growing the fastest for 
historically disadvantaged workers, re-
versing trends under the previous ad-
ministration. 
With this 2021 Budget, my Adminis-
tration is placing a special focus on 
these forgotten Americans, because 
every individual deserves to experience 
the dignity that comes through work. 
The truth is, jobs do not just provide 
paychecks: they give people purpose; 
allow them to engage with their com-
munities; and help them reach their 
true potential. As we have shown, the 
right policies offer Americans paths to 
independence 
rather 
than 
trapping 
them in reliance on Government pro-
grams. 
The era of putting American workers 
second and doubling down on the failed 
policies of the past is over. While job 
creation during my Presidency has sur-
passed expectations, the credit belongs 
to the job creators and workers who 
risk everything and devote themselves 
to building a better future for them-
selves, their families, and their Nation. 
The Federal Government does not cre-
ate jobs; hardworking Americans cre-
ate jobs. My Administration’s role is to 
follow our foundational policy pillars 
and allow our job creators and workers 
to do what they do best. 
To ensure this economic strength 
continues, I have called on the Govern-
ment to reduce wasteful, unnecessary 
spending, and to fix mismanagement 
and redundancy across agencies. This 
includes prioritizing spending for pro-
grams that are a core function of the 
United States Government. 
As we enter the 2020’s, our Nation 
confronts new challenges and opportu-
nities. The 21st century requires us to 
focus on great power rivals; prioritize 
artificial intelligence, 5G, and indus-
tries of the future; and to protect our 
research and environment from foreign 
government influence. To meet these 
challenges and seize these opportuni-
ties, we must shift the Government out 
of its old and outdated ways. This will 
require each and every Government 
agency to do more to prepare for the 
demands of tomorrow. 
The following are key priorities of 
my Administration: 
Better Trade Deals. Renegotiated or 
new trade deals with Canada and Mex-
ico, China, South Korea, and Japan are 
modernizing international trade and 
creating freer, fairer, and more recip-
rocal trade between the United States 
and our largest economic partners. 
These deals will enable our country’s 
manufacturing 
renaissance 
to 
con-
tinue. Trade deals are in development 
with the United Kingdom and the Eu-
ropean Union, as well as other coun-
tries that desire access to the coveted 
American market. These deals will ex-
pand American markets abroad and 
keep businesses here in America, which 
means keeping jobs here at home. 
Preserving Peace through Strength. 
To sustain security at home and pro-
mote American interests abroad, my 
Administration has rebuilt the mili-
tary. A strong military, fully equipped 
and integrated with our allies and all 
our instruments of power, enables our 
Nation to deter war, preserve peace, 
and, if necessary, defeat aggression 
against the United States and her peo-
ple. To that end, my Budget requests 
$740.5 billion for national defense. 
Overcoming the Opioid Crisis. Be-
cause of my Administration’s aggres-
sive tactics to fight over-prescription 
of opioids, promote effective treatment 
for addiction, and secure the border, we 
are turning the tide of the opioid crisis. 
Since my term began, we have seen a 
more than 30 percent decrease in the 
total amount of opioids prescribed, and 
deaths from drug overdose fell for the 
first time in nearly 30 years in 2018. 
Failure is not an option when it 
comes to helping people avoid the pain, 
suffering, and death caused by addic-
tion. Work must play an integral role 
in any solution. Research shows that 
holding a job is a key factor in helping 
people overcome drug addiction. For 
the duration of my Presidency, I will 
continue to promote policies that will 
beat back this deadly crisis and pro-
mote job training and employment op-
portunities for Americans who are re-
building their lives after struggling 
with addiction. 
Regulation Relief. Many pundits and 
Washington insiders laughed when I 
promised to cut two regulations for 
every new regulation. They were cor-
rect that two-for-one was the wrong 
goal. Instead, the Federal Government 
has cut more than seven regulations 
for every significant new regulation. 
After only 3 years, my Administration 
has cut a historic number of regula-
tions, and we have put the brakes on an 
endless assault of new, costly actions 
by Federal agencies. 
Our commitment to regulatory re-
form stems from the simple truth that 
the vast majority of business owners 
want to do the right thing, comply 
with the law, and treat their workers 
fairly. The Federal Government ig-
nored this reality for far too long and 
abused its authority to go after busi-
nesses, especially small businesses and 
entrepreneurs, in ways that can only 
be described as arbitrary and abusive. 
At the same time, we are maintain-
ing America’s world-class standards of 
environmental protection. Emissions 
of all criteria pollutants dropped be-
tween 2016 and 2018. The United States 
environmental record is one of the 
strongest in the world and continues to 
have some of the cleanest air and water 
in the world. 
American 
Energy 
Independence. 
American energy powers our cities and 
towns, empowers innovators, drives our 
economy, and protects our sovereignty. 
Energy companies across the world are 
ready to build in our Nation, and per-
mitting reform that cuts red tape 
shows that we welcome their invest-
ments. My Administration continues 
to support growth in the energy sector 
by removing unnecessary regulations 
and unleashing America’s vast natural 
and human resources. Through these 
actions, the United States is now on 
track to be a net exporter of crude oil 
and natural gas for all of 2020, a major 
milestone not achieved in nearly 70 
years. In addition to being the world’s 
largest natural gas producer, we also 
became the world’s top crude oil pro-
ducer in 2018. 
The records of our energy boom are 
widespread. Energy production has cre-
ated jobs in areas of the United States 
where job opportunities were scarce. It 
also provides enormous benefits to 
families across the Nation by lowering 
energy prices. And it further distances 
us from geopolitical foes who wish to 
cause us harm. More jobs, lower costs, 
and American dominance—these are 
predictable results of our pro-energy 
policies. 
Today, there is hope throughout 
America. There is optimism that was 
not here before 63 million Americans 
asked me to work for them and drain 
the swamp. For decades, Washington 
elites told us that Americans had no 
choice but to accept stagnation, decay, 
and decline. 
We proved them wrong. Our economy 
is strong once more, and America’s role 
as leader of the Free World has been re-
stored. 
America is the single greatest coun-
try in the world. We must never believe 
for one moment that this great Nation 
is destined for a diminished future. 
When we take hold of our freedom, and 
take our destiny in our hands, we 
choose to reject a future of American 
decline. My 2021 Budget sets the course 
for a future of continued American 
dominance and prosperity.

RESOLUTION 
494—DE-
NOUNCING 
FEMALE 
GENITAL 
MUTILATION OR CUTTING AS A 
VIOLATION 
OF 
THE 
HUMAN 
RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS 
AND 
URGING 
THE 
INTER-
NATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO IN-
CREASE EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE 
THE HARMFUL PRACTICE 
Ms. ERNST (for herself, Mrs. BLACK-
BURN, Mrs. CAPITO, Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, 
Mrs. LOEFFLER, Mrs. FISCHER, and Mr. 
BRAUN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 494 
Whereas female genital mutilation or cut-
ting (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘FGM/ 
C’’) is recognized internationally as a viola-
tion of the human rights of women and girls; 
Whereas FGM/C comprises all procedures 
that involve partial or total removal of the 
external female genitalia or other injury to 
the female genital organs for nonmedical 
reasons; 
Whereas an estimated 200 million girls and 
women alive as of January 2020 have been 
victims of FGM/C, with girls under the age of 
15 representing 44 million of those who have 
been cut; 
Whereas more than 3 million girls are esti-
mated to be at risk of FGM/C annually; 
Whereas the practice of FGM/C is mostly 
carried out on young girls between infancy 
and age 15; 
Whereas the practice of FGM/C is rooted in 
gender inequality and is often linked to 
other elements of gender-based violence and 
discrimination, such as child marriage; 
Whereas the World Health Organization as-
serts that FGM/C— 
(1) has no health benefits for women and 
girls; and 
(2) can have long-term impacts on the 
physical, psychological, sexual, and repro-
ductive health of the women and girls who 
experience FGM/C; 
Whereas the impacts of FGM/C on the 
physical health of women and girls can in-
clude bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula, 
complications during childbirth, and death; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Children’s Fund, FGM/C is reported to occur 
in all parts of the world, but is most preva-
lent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and 
Asia; 
Whereas, although the practice of FGM/C 
is highly concentrated in specific regions 
and associated with several cultural tradi-
tions, it is not tied to any one religion; 
Whereas, in 2016, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention published a report 
estimating that 513,000 women and girls in 
the United States were at risk of, or may 
have been subjected to, FGM/C; 
Whereas, in 2015, the United Nations adopt-
ed a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals 
that includes a target to eliminate FGM/C by 
2030, having previously recognized in 2010 
that ‘‘the abandonment of this harmful prac-
tice can be achieved as a result of a com-
prehensive movement that involves all pub-
lic and private stakeholders in society’’; 
Whereas the elimination of FGM/C has 
been called for— 
(1) by numerous intergovernmental organi-
zations, including the African Union, the Eu-
ropean Union, and the Organization of Is-
lamic Cooperation; and 
(2) in 3 resolutions of the United Nations 
General Assembly; 
Whereas the Annual Country Reports on 
Human Rights Practices prepared by the De-
partment of State include information on— 
(1) whether FGM/C is prevalent; 
(2) the type and category of genital cutting 
that is most common; and 
(3) international and governmental efforts 
to address the practice of FGM/C; 
Whereas the Federal Government recog-
nized FGM/C as a form of gender-based vio-
lence in— 
(1) the United States Strategy to Prevent 
and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Glob-
ally, released in August 2012 and updated in 
June 2016; and 
(2) the United States Global Strategy to 
Empower 
Adolescent 
Girls, 
released 
in 
March 2016; 
Whereas a Government Accountability Of-
fice report released in 2016 concluded that 
‘‘State and USAID currently have limited 
international assistance efforts to address 
FGM/C’’; and 
Whereas, in 2012, the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly designated February 6 as the 
‘‘International Day of Zero Tolerance for Fe-
male Genital Mutilation’’ to enhance aware-
ness of, and encourage concrete actions by 
governments and individuals against, the 
practice of FGM/C: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) denounces female genital mutilation or 
cutting as a violation of the human rights of 
women and girls; 
(2) affirms the importance of ending the 
practice of female genital mutilation or cut-
ting globally for the safety and security of 
women; 
(3) calls upon the international community 
to increase efforts to accelerate the elimi-
nation of female genital mutilation or cut-
ting; and 
(4) urges the Secretary of State and the 
Administrator of the United States Agency 
for International Development to incor-
porate coordinated efforts to eliminate fe-
male genital mutilation or cutting into the 
gender programs of the Department of State 
and the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development, respectively.

BUDGET PROPOSAL 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, thank 
you, and I thank the Republican lead-
er. 
Last month, while this body was try-
ing, as we know—and failing—to hold 
the President accountable for betray-
ing the American people, President 
Trump went to Davos, and he doubled 
down on another betrayal of the Amer-
ican people. 
While he was hobnobbing with the 
global elite in Switzerland, he let slip 
his plan, after his tax handouts to bil-
lionaires and corporations blew up the 
deficit—we know deficits now. Thanks 
to Republican governing, thanks to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S967 
February 10, 2020 
this President’s tax cut and my Repub-
lican colleagues going along with this 
tax cut that went overwhelmingly to 
the wealthiest people in this country, 
the 
budget 
deficit 
has 
just 
sky-
rocketed. We know all that. President 
Trump now wants to pay for it by cut-
ting Social Security and Medicare. He 
wants to pay for it by cutting Social 
Security and Medicare. 
Today we got President Trump’s 
budget. This document makes it clear 
how he wants to pay for his tax scam— 
on the backs of working families and 
seniors. 
I want to start with one that is of 
special interest in Ohio. We all know 
that just in the last 2 or 3 years—well, 
starting soon after President Trump 
was elected and then over about a year- 
and-a-half period, the Lordstown auto 
plant—about 4,500 jobs—shut down. 
President Trump had promised those 
workers—he said to Mahoning Valley: 
Don’t sell your homes. These jobs are 
coming back. This is going to work for 
us. And then the President Trump did 
absolutely nothing. The third shift was 
laid off. The second shift laid was off. 
The first shift was laid off. The plant 
closed, and there were 4,500 lost jobs. 
I have been working with Senator 
PORTMAN—my Republican colleague— 
and others on getting somebody to 
come into that plant. It will not just be 
the 4,500 good UAW jobs, but it could 
be, potentially, a good many jobs. 
There was a loan program that we and 
this company were going to use to 
make sure they could, if you will, re-
industrialize part of the Lordstown 
complex. Well, the President’s budget 
axed that plan, that loan program. We 
were counting on that as a way to re-
place some of those jobs that the Presi-
dent of the United States promised 
would come back, and now we can’t 
even count on that. There is that. 
Then, in addition to the cuts to Medi-
care and Social Security, he is taking a 
sledgehammer to Medicaid, to food 
stamps, to investments in infrastruc-
ture, and support for rural commu-
nities and small towns. He wants to 
make it harder to clean up our drink-
ing water and stop polluters. 
At a time when one in four renters 
spends more than half of their income 
in housing, he wants to make it harder 
to help families find and afford loans 
for a home. Pretty much the only ones 
who escaped unscathed, the only ones 
the President’s budget acts didn’t hit: 
corporations and their wealthy, unac-
countable CEOs. To fund their tax 
cuts—again, the tax cuts 2 years ago— 
70 percent of the tax cuts went to the 
wealthiest 1 percent of people in this 
country. To pay for those tax cuts that 
have exploded the Federal budget def-
icit—you don’t have to be an account-
ant like my friend from Wyoming to 
understand what has happened to this 
deficit—President Trump wants to ask 
more from families struggling to make 
ends meet, the families he promised to 
fight for, the families he has betrayed. 
He wants to ask more of seniors and 
people with disabilities and students 
and kids who need healthcare, all to 
pay for this tax scam. 
President Trump sold us a tax cut for 
working people, but the jig is up. We 
know people aren’t seeing more money 
in their paychecks. People see Trump’s 
tax scam for what it really was: a give-
away to corporations and the wealthi-
est, tiny sliver of the population. 
Remember the promises the Presi-
dent made that his tax law would mean 
raises for workers? He said it over and 
over. I was in the President’s Cabinet 
room with the President and a handful 
of Senators from both parties. He 
promised, before it passed, With this 
tax bill, everybody will get a $4,000 
raise, he said—well, not exactly true. 
He told workers last year, the month 
after he signed the law, You are going 
to start seeing a lot more money in 
your paycheck. 
One lie after another lie after an-
other lie. Instead of investing in work-
ers, corporations bought back tril-
lions—literally, trillions—of dollars of 
their own stock to line investors’ pock-
ets. Meanwhile, the deficit exploded. 
We know what the corporate crowd’s 
plan always is to deal with the deficit, 
every single time: cut taxes, blow a 
hole in the deficit, and then go back 
and pay for it by cuts to Social Secu-
rity and Medicare. How do we know 
that is what they are going to do? Be-
cause they told us that is what they 
are going to do. In spring 2017, right 
after President Trump was elected, the 
Wall Street Journal ran an op-ed by 
economist Martin Feldstein, who has 
built his career pushing tax cuts for his 
rich friends. 
Guess 
how 
he 
wanted 
President 
Trump to pay for his corporate give-
away? In those days, the President 
said, We will have so much economic 
growth that it will pay for itself. Well, 
the economic growth has been less in 
these 3 years of Trump than in the last 
3 years of Obama, but that is not the 
point. The point is he said it would pay 
for itself. 
Well, Martin Feldstein didn’t believe 
that. He knew. He said in this article 
that it will not pay for itself; it will 
pay a little bit. But he said the best 
way to do it is raise the Social Secu-
rity retirement age. It looks like Presi-
dent Trump was listening to Martin 
Feldstein. 
It always comes back to whose side 
are you on. You stand with workers, or 
you stand with corporations. You stand 
with insurance companies, or you 
stand with patients. You stand with 
Wall Street, or you stand with con-
sumers. 
Do you fight for Wall Street wealth? 
Or do you fight for the dignity of work? 
If you love this country, you fight for 
the people who make it work. The 
President promised to fight for Amer-
ican workers and their families. This 
budget he released today is the latest 
in a long line of broken promises and 
betrayals. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Wyoming. 
f 
BUDGET PROPOSAL 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suspect I 
couldn’t have come to the floor at a 
better time. The President’s budget did 
come out today. It consists of a set of 
documents a foot high. In my opinion, 
the whole pile should be replaced with 
a list from the President of what he 
thinks are pretty good ideas to do this 
year. 
I want to encourage people, including 
the Senator from Ohio, not to waste 
any time searching out the President’s 
budget cuts. Nobody has listened to the 
President in the 23 years that I have 
been here. Congress doesn’t pay atten-
tion to the President’s budget exercise. 
I don’t know why we put him through 
that. That is all it is. 
Congress holds the pursestrings, ac-
cording to the Constitution. Congress 
is very protective of that constitu-
tional authority. If you don’t believe 
me, watch all the rhetoric that comes 
out on the President’s budget. I am 
hoping that I hear something positive 
on it, but it is pretty hard to find any-
thing positive with the funding situa-
tion that we are in. I do have to take 
issue with something that was just said 
here, that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
hasn’t worked. It has worked. 
Now, a very important thing for ev-
erybody to know: The problem that we 
are in right now with our deficits 
doesn’t have to do with the dollars that 
are coming in. The first year after the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we took in 
more revenue than ever before. More 
people had jobs. More people were pay-
ing taxes. Companies were paying more 
taxes. They were doing more business. 
That results in more taxes. So, that 
first year, we got more money than we 
had ever had to spend before. 
The second year, we had more money 
than the first year. We keep getting 
more money to spend. The problem is 
we have no control over our urge to 
spend. Since CBO’s June 2019 Long- 
Term Budget Outlook, Congress has 
passed and the President has signed 
legislation that would add more than 
$2 trillion to our national debt over the 
next 10 years. That is how we are 
spending. 
The increased spending caps from the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 are re-
sponsible for $1.7 trillion of that $2.1 
trillion. It does include interest costs, 
but that is what we have to pay any 
time we have a debt. That $1.7 trillion 
passed with no debate. There was a 
budget point of order. I had established 
a budget point of order, which takes 60 
votes. I missed by four being able to 
stop that. We can’t spend that way. 
But that isn’t the President’s budget. 
That is our budget. 
Over the next few days, you will hear 
lots of complaints about the Presi-
dent’s budget. Seldom will anybody 
mention anything good, and it has been 
that way for every President. You will

hear lots of terrible things about the 
President’s budget. You won’t hear 
anything positive. In the present polit-
ical atmosphere, you probably will not 
learn anything from the comments. 
Little of a positive nature is getting 
any coverage in Washington these 
days. 
Recently, I went to a hearing on the 
dangers of youth vaping. It turned into 
a diatribe about President Trump. 
Presidents’ budgets, regardless of what 
President, are a chance for Members 
not in his party to beat up verbally on 
whoever is President. For that reason, 
I didn’t hold a hearing on President 
Obama’s last budget, and I will not be 
holding one on this President’s budget 
for that reason. Let me repeat that. 
Because it turns into a diatribe against 
the President, I did not hold a hearing 
on President Obama’s last budget, and, 
for that same reason, I am not going to 
hold a hearing on this President’s 
budget. 
If you want the animosity of a budg-
et hearing, the House of Representa-
tives will have the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, OMB, for a hearing 
this Wednesday. You can take that in 
and get your dose of animosity if you 
want. It will be a chance for the House 
to ask loaded, venomous questions of 
the Director. 
The budget process is not working. 
The only thing of real value in any 
President’s budget is our history of 
spending. That is what has already 
been done. We ought to look at that. 
We ought to see the mistakes that we 
have made, the way that we have piled 
up this debt. If Congress, for once, 
could spend a portion of the scrutiny 
they give to the President’s projected 
cuts and, instead, look at the history 
of our spending, we might be able to 
gain ground. Yes, only cuts will be 
blasted, even though we never make 
cuts; we just keep spending. 
The official budget is done in the 
Senate and separately in the House and 
is only official if the House and Senate 
can reach agreement. When the two 
Chambers of Congress are opposite ma-
jorities, there is little chance for 
agreement. From history, I can assure 
you cuts will not be made. I can also 
assure you that seldom does any pro-
gram get as big of an increase as the 
participants request, but that is chang-
ing. There is no spending constraint. 
There is seldom an attempt to find 
money to cover the costs, especially on 
new services that are dreamed up. 
I will do a budget. I will ask the 
Democrats to help put together a re-
sponsible budget, working with Repub-
licans. That is really the only way it 
can work responsibly. What do I mean 
by ‘‘responsibly’’? The Budget Com-
mittee only sets limits on spending. A 
lot of people think that we dig into 
every detail and decide how much ev-
erybody is going to get. No. We set lim-
its in a broad number of categories. It 
is the Appropriations Committee that 
allocates the specific dollars, but we 
always wind up spending beyond the 
limit set by the budget, even if a budg-
et can be agreed on. 
How can that happen? When a spend-
ing bill or a spending idea comes to the 
Senate floor, the bill technically needs 
60 votes to pass. To bust the budget 
limits also only takes 60 votes, so any 
idea or spending bill that is able to 
pass already, it already has the votes 
to bust the budget and put us deeper 
into debt. 
Congress also doesn’t meet spending 
deadlines. If Congress passes a con-
tinuing resolution, which means we 
couldn’t agree by the end of the fiscal 
year, the government stays open with 
permission to spend each month 1/12 of 
what it was allocated the previous 
year. That is what a continuing resolu-
tion does; it allows them to keep oper-
ating at what they had before. 
Continuing 
resolutions 
continue 
until both sides are able to negotiate 
what they want, but the new method of 
compromise is you can have everything 
you want as long as you will let me 
have everything I want. What kind of 
negotiation is that? 
Well, as I mentioned before, it is $1.7 
trillion and one vote with no debate. 
Yeah. How would your Christmas shop-
ping for your family work under those 
circumstances where everybody could 
have whatever they wanted? Wouldn’t 
it even be worse if you were spending 
someone else’s money for those Christ-
mas presents? What if it appeared to be 
an unlimited supply of money? How 
long would that last? 
Of course, if a continuing resolution 
doesn’t pass, the government is shut 
down. The employees are sent home. 
Federal public places are shut down 
and closed to the public. When agree-
ment is finally reached, the employees 
come back. They are paid for the time 
they were off. They are way behind in 
their work, which hurts the economy 
when 
permits 
aren’t 
released—and 
other things. We also have to pay lots 
of overtime to catch up for the time 
they were off. 
There are several proposals out there 
that could stop shutdowns and put 
pressure on Congress to get the spend-
ing job done on time. How long can we 
overspend? Well, interest, I think, is 
currently in the area of 21⁄2 percent. If 
people lose confidence in the Federal 
Government, we will have to pay a 
higher interest rate in order to get the 
money to cover the debt. Yes, we have 
to pay the interest. If we default on the 
interest, the country defaults. If that 
interest rate were to go from the cur-
rent 21⁄2 percent to the normal 5 per-
cent, we would only be able to pay for 
Social Security, Medicare, and Med-
icaid. 
You didn’t hear me say anything 
about defense. You didn’t hear me say 
anything about education. You didn’t 
hear me say anything about infrastruc-
ture. You didn’t hear me say anything 
except Social Security, Medicaid, and 
Medicare. That is what happens if peo-
ple lose confidence in this, if they 
think we are overspending continually 
and that we don’t intend to get control 
over it. 
I will tell you a few other things that 
you might not be aware of. Did you 
know that most Federal dollars are 
spent without Congress ever voting on 
it a second time? Those are called man-
datory programs. Once a program is ap-
proved in the mandatory category, 
that spending is never voted on again. 
Worse yet, no one hardly ever looks at 
the program to see if it does what it 
was supposed to do. Nothing should be 
mandatory that doesn’t have a source 
of revenue—that is, money—sufficient 
to fund it into the future. Do you know 
what that would amount to if we had 
that kind of rule on mandatory? 
Social Security no longer brings in as 
much money as we pay out. Medicare 
doesn’t bring in the money that we pay 
out. Medicaid doesn’t bring in the 
money that we pay out. In the manda-
tory programs, there are probably only 
about four that have a source of rev-
enue to fund them. The rest all take 
money from the general fund, which 
means that the general fund doesn’t 
really have any money for the discre-
tionary things that we vote on—you 
know, that big fight we have once a 
year come October 1 to fund the rest of 
government—and mostly defense is in 
that category. 
I don’t get invited to speak at many 
places. It is kind of depressing. 
But once the program is approved, 
mandatory spending is never voted on 
again, and no one looks at the program 
to see what it is supposed to do. They 
still get their annual money, even 
though some of these programs have 
expired. They had an expiration date, 
and we went past the expiration date, 
which means the program shouldn’t 
exist anymore, but it does, and we con-
tinue to fund it, not only at its pre-
vious, expired level. We keep adding 
cost-of-living increases for it. Yes, it is 
probably needed, but what is the 
money really doing? 
No business would be in business if 
they didn’t check even more than an-
nually to see what is working effec-
tively 
and 
eliminating 
those 
that 
aren’t. We should be doing that task. 
When was the last time you saw a pro-
gram eliminated around here? I have 
been here 23 years. Nope. 
Then there is the problem with pro-
gram duplication. When I got to Wash-
ington, there were 119 preschool chil-
dren’s programs. Those are really im-
portant. If kids get the learning they 
need before they go to kindergarten, it 
makes a difference in the rest of their 
life—but 119 programs? Senator KEN-
NEDY
and 
I 
worked 
together 
and 
merged quite a few of those. We elimi-
nated some—so there are some pro-
grams that got eliminated—and we got 
that down to 45 programs. Five would 
probably do the job. We did pass an 
amendment to a bill that said that 
those had to be pared down to five pro-
grams, and that all of them had to be 
under the Department of Education. 
The reason we weren’t able to get

February 10, 2020 
below 45 is because we didn’t have ju-
risdiction over those in Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions. Those 
were all in other groups. 
In the area of housing, we have 160 
programs—160 programs—and they are 
administered by 20 different agencies. 
So really, nobody is in charge. So no-
body is setting goals. So nobody is 
checking to see if it is working. No-
body is checking to see if the program 
over here in one of those 20 is the same 
as the program over here in another 
one of the 20, which would allow them 
to be merged. 
Merging saves money. If you merge, 
you only need one director, instead of 
two, and you don’t need all the assist-
ants there were. You only need the as-
sistants for one program, and the 
money that would be stuck in Wash-
ington can actually go to what we 
thought was going to get done. Every 
merger results in savings. Elimination 
results in more savings. How much bet-
ter would it be to move the money to 
where the results are? 
The proposed budget reforms that 
Senator WHITEHOUSE and I have worked 
on would provide for portfolio reviews. 
Here is how that works. Each com-
mittee would have to look at all of the 
programs, of the type that would be in 
their jurisdiction if it weren’t handled 
in a bunch of other places. So those 
other places would have to look at the 
ones under their jurisdiction. If we can 
get that portfolio review, I think we 
would find that some of those areas 
where we are doing it time after time, 
mostly by just adding to Washington 
bureaucracy. 
We want the money out there where 
the problem is. We think we are solving 
problems, but we are not solving prob-
lems. We are just hiring more people in 
DC. We used to have a policy that the 
last person hired would be the first per-
son fired and that resulted in an in-
crease in government, too, because as 
soon as you got hired, you could ex-
pand your workload so you needed an 
assistant, and now you weren’t the 
first in line to be fired. That has re-
sulted in a lot of people working in 
Washington. How much money actu-
ally makes it to the problem? We ought 
to see if the money makes it to the 
people or if we are just increasing 
Washington bureaucracy. 
Over the next few weeks, I will be 
going into some detail on each of these 
problems with budgeting. I will also be 
promoting the budget reforms that 
Senator WHITEHOUSE
and I and the 
Budget Committee have put out favor-
ably. I think that is the first budget 
provision in about the last 2 two dec-
ades that has come out of the com-
mittee in a bipartisan way. 
Now, I could tell you that the re-
forms that we proposed will not solve 
all of the problem. You can’t take that 
big of a leap when you have that big of 
a problem. But while those reforms will 
not solve the problem, they should help 
to make the solutions more noticeable. 
We are having trouble getting that 
on the floor, too. 
I really came to the floor to elimi-
nate some of the concerns about the 
President’s budget. I want people to 
know that they don’t all have to fly to 
Washington to make their case to the 
Budget Committee for their program. 
Once the Budget Committee sets the 
parameters, then, the detail comes into 
play with the Appropriations Com-
mittee. 
Talk to your appropriators. They 
spend the money—the exact dollars. Do 
your work there, but be sure your pro-
gram is as effective as it can be. Also, 
take a little look at how many similar 
Federal programs there are. See if 
there can be a savings by merging 
some, thus getting more money out in 
the field where you are and getting 
more money on the problem. 
Once again, the President’s budget 
came out today. It consists of a set of 
documents a foot high. In my opinion, 
the whole pile should be replaced with 
a list from the President of what he 
thinks are pretty good ideas to do this 
year and, hopefully, there will also be a 
little piece in there that says how you 
can pay for it. 
So don’t waste any time searching 
out the President’s budget program 
cuts. Congress doesn’t pay any atten-
tion to the President’s budget exercise. 
That is all it is—an exercise. Congress 
holds the purse strings, according to 
the Constitution, and Congress is very 
protective of that constitutional au-
thority. Now we need to do the work 
that goes with that authority. 
I yield the floor.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
IN-
CREASED 
TRANSPARENCY 
IN 
501(C)(4) ORGANIZATIONS ACT OF 
2020 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce 
the 
Increased 
Transparency 
in 
501(c)(4) Organizations Act of 2020. This bill 
would require the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) to make publicly available the forms or-
ganizations that self-declare under Section 
501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 
file with the IRS. Americans have the right to 
know which organizations are operating under 
this section of the IRC. 
To be eligible for tax-exempt status under 
501(c)(4), organizations, often referred to as 
‘‘social welfare organizations,’’ must be ‘‘de-
voted exclusively to charitable, educational, or 
recreational purposes.’’ They can choose to 
apply for 501(c)(4) status from the IRS, or 
they can simply self-declare. Previously, orga-
nizations 
seeking 
to 
self-declare 
their 
501(c)(4) status were not required even to no-
tify the IRS of their existence. In 2015, how-
ever, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes 
Act of 2015 (the PATH Act) was enacted into 
law. Under that law, an organization seeking 
to self-declare their 501(c)(4) status now must 
file a notice with the IRS that it is operating 
under this section. The PATH Act did not, 
however, make the filed notices, Form 8976, 
subject to public disclosure. 
The IRS has opined that Form 8976 cannot 
be made available under the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act or other disclosure laws. This opin-
ion creates a discrepancy between those or-
ganizations for which the IRS must make pub-
licly available information—all Section 50l(c)(3) 
organizations and 501(c)(4) organizations that 
applied that for status—and self-declared 
501(c)(4) organizations. This discrepancy ap-
pears to have been inadvertently created by 
the PATH Act. 
My bill would correct this oversight and 
mandate that the IRS publicly disclose any 
filed Form 8976 upon request, thus allowing 
the public to know which organizations oper-
ate under 501(c)(4), as they do with 501(c)(3) 
organizations. In the aftermath of the Citizens 
United Supreme Court decision, which allows 
for unlimited expenditure in political campaigns 
from these ‘‘social welfare’’ groups, this bill is 
especially important to allow for greater trans-
parency. I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

CELEBRATING THE 30TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF HOMESTRETCH 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I recognize the 30th anni-
versary of Homestretch, a Falls Church orga-
nization dedicated to empowering homeless 
families in Northern Virginia to secure perma-
nent housing and to attain the knowledge, 
skills and hope they need to achieve lasting 
economic self-sufficient. 
Homestretch has assisted substantially in 
the efforts of Fairfax County and the City of 
Falls Church to end homelessness by pro-
viding housing and comprehensive services to 
over 1,000 homeless families with over 3,000 
homeless children since its inception in 1990. 
The organization contributes to the goals of 
One Fairfax by equipping families to escape 
homelessness 
and 
poverty 
permanently 
through programs that help them acquire skills 
and education, reduce debt and repair credit, 
enter lucrative career paths and restore their 
health. 
Furthermore, Homestretch significantly con-
tributes to the economic empowerment of 
homeless parents with children in Northern 
Virginia by launching them into such careers 
as nurses, chefs, teachers, accountants, real-
tors, dental assistants, pastors, commercial 
drivers, social workers, business analysts, 
pharmacy 
techs, 
master 
plumbers, 
restauranteurs, and auto mechanics. 
In addition to its wide array of services for 
homeless families, Homestretch also provides 
quality early education for homeless and low- 
income children through its licensed pre-
school, Kidstretch, and ensures the edu-
cational success for youth in their program 
through its dedicated collaboration with the 
Fairfax County and Falls Church City Schools. 
Homestretch has achieved unparalleled suc-
cess in equipping homeless families to secure 
and maintain long term employment and per-
manent housing, with 90 percent families com-
pleting the program by moving into permanent 
housing that they can afford on income they 
earn; and with 95 percent of its graduates 
never returning to homelessness. 
The organization enjoys deep community 
support with over 800 volunteers over 1,400 
donors each year and demonstrates that dra-
matic transformation of lives is possible, given 
the right structure, support and opportunity. 
I commend Homestretch’s staff on their or-
ganization’s 30th anniversary, I am sincerely 
grateful for their tireless efforts to improve the 
lives of many of Northern Virginia’s most vul-
nerable families and for giving them the tools 
to succeed.

RACHEL CRANE MATHER SCHOOL 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Rachel Crane Mather, the 
founder of Beaufort’s Mather School. 
Rachel Mather moved to the Lowcountry in 
1867 after the Civil War. She was a woman of 
faith and an educator. Mather hit the ground 
running as soon as she got to Beaufort and 
within a year, she opened her own institution. 
Her hopes and dreams came to life by serving 
others. 
The book of Matthew, Chapter 11, verse 28 
reads ‘‘Come to me, all you who are weary 
and burdened, and I will give you rest.’’ Led 
by faith and perseverance, Mather taught the 
weary and gave them food, housing, and rest 
during the southern Reconstruction Era. 
The Mather School was a sanctuary for the 
young women in the Lowcountry and pro-
duced over a century of superior education in 
Rachel’s name. As the matriarch of this institu-
tion, we honor the culture and legacy she has 
left today.

RECOGNIZING RONNIE 
RAKESTRAW 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize an outstanding Mis-
sissippian, Ronnie Rakestraw. 
Ronnie Rakestraw formerly served the pub-
lic as the Union County East Post Justice 
Court Judge for over 32 years. During his ex-
tensive career, Ronnie saw many changes in 
the Mississippi court system. He was present 
when Union County decided to divide justice 
court judges into East and West Posts. Ronnie 
always remained a dedicated public servant 
and continued to put Mississippi first. He also 
served as a municipal court judge for the town 
of Sherman, Mississippi, for over 20 years. 
I thank Ronnie for his lifelong dedication to 
the law and for making Mississippi a better 
place. I wish him many years of good health.

HONORING MASTER CAPTAIN 
WILLIAM WARD 
HON. CHARLIE CRIST 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Master Captain William Ward, 
of Florida, who passed away December 13, 
2019 at the age of 57. 
William was licensed by the U.S. Coast 
Guard as a Merchant Marine Officer in 1991. 
He earned his bachelor’s degree from the Uni-
versity of South Florida-College of Business in 
Accounting in 1994, and attained his Juris 
Doctor degree in 2013, from Barry University 
College of Law. 
Mr. Ward was the President and C.E.O. of 
Captains Finest Seafood from 1994 to 2009, 
served on the Gulf Fisherman’s Association 
board of directors since 2004, was the Vice 
President of Seafood Harvesters of America, 
and a board member with the Gulf Coast 
Leadership Conference. In addition, Mr. Ward 
was a member director of Fish for America, 
USA, representing and educating the millions 
of seafood consumers in the United States. 
His leadership and efforts earned him the title 
of Florida Businessman of the Year in 2001 
and in 2004 as the National Business Council 
Chairman. 
Mr. Ward advocated for sensible fisheries 
policy, including passage of the Port State 
Measures Agreement, which helped curb un-
regulated, unreported and illegal fishing. Addi-
tionally, Mr. Ward assisted in drafting legisla-
tion, advocating on its behalf, and consulting 
with state and federal governmental agencies 
in the development and implementation of 
protectionary natural resource regulations and 
rules. William also served as an expert con-
sultant after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil 
spill. He worked extensively on the passage of 
the Restore Act which provided the primary 
source of funding for the economic and eco-
logical recovery of the Gulf States. 
Mr. Ward represented the State of Florida 
as a two-time Gubernatorial Appointee to the 
Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission from 
1999 to 2003. Further, William has served on 
numerous state and federal natural resources 
advisory panels, as well as two NOAA federal 
appointments serving on the advisory commit-
tees of the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Manage-
ment Council. 
Later in life, William worked as an attorney 
on several successfully litigated state and fed-
eral court cases during his time as managing 
partner of Ward Consulting Partners, LLC, and 
the William Ward Law Group, PLLC. He also 
testified as an expert witness on marine fish-
eries cases in federal court, one of which pre-
vailed in the U.S. Supreme Court. 
During his career, William has consulted or 
worked with the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration (NOAA) Washington 
D.C., NOAA, Southeast Headquarters, NOAA, 
Southeast Fisheries Science Center, the Flor-
ida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the Florida 
Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, Florida

of Miami-Rosenstiel School of Marine and At-
mospheric Science, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. 
Coast Guard Regional Coast Guard Head-
quarters in New Orleans, Miami, St. Peters-
burg, and Clearwater. 
William Ward was well respected and cher-
ished on Capitol Hill, among his peers on the 
water, in the legal community and in the envi-
ronmental community. He was a great friend 
and compassionate advocate who worked tire-
lessly to protect the people and waters he 
loved. Thanks to his contributions and advo-
cacy, our coastal environment and fisheries 
are more sustainable than before.

NATIONAL COURT REPORTING AND 
CAPTIONING WEEK 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, today, we rec-
ognize the Eighth Annual Court Reporters and 
Captioners Week. Approximately 48 million 
Americans are considered deaf or hard-of- 
hearing, and the captioning services that 
realtime writers and stenographic captioners 
ensure that all Americans have equal access 
to news and other vital information. 
Realtime writers are highly trained profes-
sionals who share a unique ability to convert 
the spoken word to text that can be read, 
streamed, broadcast, searched, and archived. 
This specialization includes broadcast cap-
tioning and realtime translation services for 
people who are deaf and hard of hearing, as 
well as providing near-instant translation in 
legal and other settings. 
In the 116th Congress, I am proud to have 
reintroduced the Training for Realtime Writers 
Act, which reauthorizes the Training for 
Realtime Writers Grant Program and encour-
ages careers in realtime writing and court re-
porting, provides scholarships for students, 
and modernizes curriculum to adapt to our 
changing world. I was proud to have my bill in-
cluded in the 2008 Higher Education Act Re-
authorization. 
The Training for Realtime Writers Grant Pro-
gram has been incredibly successful in train-
ing the current generation of captioners and 
court reporters and has aided in the rapid 
growth of these professions. By reauthorizing 
the Training for Realtime Writers grants, new 
students will have the opportunity to enter a 
technical, well-paid, and highly skilled career 
that will allow them to become court reporters 
and captioners immediately upon graduation. 
From maintaining the integrity of our democ-
racy to ensuring every citizen stays up to date 
on today’s 24-hour news cycle, realtime writ-
ers are vital to Americans in all communities. 
Over the past decade, this program has en-
couraged a new generation of realtime writers 
to enter this vital field. I am proud to work with 
the National Court Reporters Association and 
with my friend Rep. Rodney Davis, to reau-
thorize this program so we can continue to in-
crease awareness and interest in this profes-
sion.

IN RECOGNITION OF MARK REITER 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a friend and a giant in the recycling 
industry—Mark Reiter. 
Mark was born and grew up in the Bronx— 
the South Bronx as he would say. Mark was 
an avid Brooklyn Dodgers fan. He later be-
came a Nationals fan as a result of spending 
most of his life in Washington, D.C.; but make 
no mistake about it, Mark was a New Yorker 
through and through and never let you forget 
it. 
Mark originally came to Washington to work 
for the late Bella Abzug. Mark would often en-
tertain people with stories about those years 
working in her office. Representative Abzug 
was proud of Mark and his tireless devotion to 
environmental issues, as well as his commit-
ment to others, especially those who were 
less fortunate. Later, Mark worked for the Sen-
ate Environment and Public Works Committee, 
helping shape our nation’s environmental pol-
icy at its earliest stages. While he was a reli-
able Democrat, many of his friends were very 
reliable Republicans. He knew how to get 
things done by working with others, under-
standing others, and of course, caring for oth-
ers. 
One of Mark’s great accomplishments was 
the enactment of the Superfund Recycling Eq-
uity Act (SREA), which provided environmental 
clarity for recyclers facing potential liability 
under Superfund. Because of SREA, recyclers 
today conduct due diligence to ensure their 
materials are used again in an environmentally 
responsible manner. SREA was a monumental 
achievement for responsible recycling and 
Mark was instrumental in its enactment. 
Mark was fiercely loyal and devoted to his 
family—his brother, nephews, nieces, and 
their children. Mark would visit them often 
wherever they lived and generously help 
whenever needed. He was very proud of them 
all. He often spoke of his admiration of his 
parents and how their hard work enabled him 
to succeed in ways they could never have 
imagined, especially as they were recent im-
migrants to this great country. Mark never for-
got where he came from and the sacrifices his 
parents made for him and his older brother Eli. 
Mark helped so many colleagues from his 
beginnings on Capitol Hill through his long 
successful career at the Institute of Scrap Re-
cycling Industries. Many of his colleagues 
have gone on to great careers of their own as 
a result of Mark’s tutelage and deep caring for 
them. I know because I am one of those col-
leagues who learned so much and was helped 
by Mark over the years. 
Mark was also a man of faith. His Jewish 
faith helped him become a caring man to so 
many, whether they be family, friends, col-
leagues or strangers. People were simply peo-
ple in Mark’s eyes. Mark cared about how oth-
ers were treated in our society and would 
speak up for them without reservation. He felt 
he had walked in their shoes before them and 
wanted life to be better for them. 
Madam Speaker, we lost a giant in the recy-
cling industry, the environmental community, 
and the Jewish community. Mark was a great 
colleague, a mentor, and a friend to many. His 
family and friends are so proud of who Mark 
became and what he left behind—a world he 
helped make better through his devotion to 
others, his work and his actions. Mark will be 
missed by so many.

CONGRATULATING 
SHALISHA 
THOMAS ON HER RECEIPT OF 
THE 2019–2020 MILKEN EDUCATOR 
AWARD 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Ms. Shalisha Thomas on 
being named a recipient of the 2019–2020 
Milken Educator Award. 
Described as ‘‘the Oscars of Teaching,’’ this 
honor is awarded to 40 educators nationally, 
and Ms. Thomas is the only winner from the 
State of Arkansas. According to the Milken 
Family. Foundation, Ms. Thomas was given 
this distinct honor for her efforts to encourage 
her students through art. 
Having received a degree in art education 
from the University of Arkansas in 2012, Ms. 
Thomas is also a valuable asset to the young 
people of the Pine Bluff community in her abil-
ity to encourage a high academic standard, 
build meaningful student-teacher relationships, 
and set students up for success in all aspects 
of life. 
Ms. Thomas’ work is a shining example of 
the power of an educator in the lives of young 
people and the power of service to a sur-
rounding community. I take this time to ap-
plaud her on her award and her further suc-
cesses, and to thank her for her exceptional 
representation of Arkansas and Fourth District 
educators.

THE

IZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY 
FORCE AGAINST IRAQ RESOLU-
TION OF 2002 
HON. DENNY HECK 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. HECK. Madam Speaker, authorizing 
military force is the most sobering responsi-
bility Congress has. 
Washington’s 10th District includes Joint 
Base Lewis-McChord, where over 40,000 
servicemembers are stationed. I am very 
aware that every decision I make can affect 
their lives and the lives of their families. I take 
that responsibility very seriously. 
In 2001, Congress passed an Authorization 
for the Use of Military Force only three days 
after the September 11th attacks. Because the 
country was still trying to determine exactly 
how we had been attacked, that AUMF was 
written broadly. In the time since, the 2001 
AUMF has been used dozens of times to jus-
tify military action. 
Subsequently, Congress passed another 
AUMF in 2002, which authorized military ac-
tion in Iraq. President Trump cited the 2002 
AUMF as justification for his decision to kill 
Qassem Soleimani in early January, more 
than 17 years after the AUMF’s passage. 
I have advocated for the end of the 2002 
AUMF since 2014, during my first term in Con-
gress. But it was only when I joined the House 
Intelligence Committee last Congress that I 
fully appreciated the scope and scale of our 
missions around the world. 
I would have joined my colleagues in voting 
to repeal the 2002 AUMF, and I was proud to 
cosponsor the underlying resolution. I strongly 
believe that Congress must reassert its role in 
decisions of when to use military force. The 
2002 AUMF has been used to justify military 
action that had not been contemplated by 
Congress. By repealing it, Congress will bring 
grave decisions about war and military action 
closer to the people whose lives will be altered 
by them. I am glad the House voted for such 
an outcome.

HONORING LILIAN SMITH OF 
COEUR D’ALENE IDAHO 
HON. RUSS FULCHER 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the work of Lilian Smith of 
Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. At a young age, Lilian 
found she had a love for mathematics and a 
passion to share her knowledge with her fel-
low students. As she entered high school, 
Lilian created a non-profit to organize competi-
tive math teams and peer mentoring programs 
at over 12 local schools in the Coeur d’Alene 
area. When first starting, Lilian convinced a 
local elementary school to start an after-school 
math team, and it grew from there. Through 
her work, Lillian has recruited dozens of stu-
dent coaches, mentors, and has even secured 
funding for the future growth of her organiza-
tion, ‘‘Growing the STEM.’’ In just three short 
years, Lilian has helped over 400 students de-
velop a meaningful skill set in mathematics 
and undoubtedly many future careers in major 
STEM fields. Her initiative is seen every day— 
through her fellow students—and through the 
community of Coeur d’Alene. As the head 
math coach at her local high school, Lilian 
continues to help fellow students excel in 
mathematics. While it may be difficult to meas-
ure the impact she has made, it is clear that 
this is just the beginning of Lilian’s impact on 
our community. I thank Lilian for her hard work 
and dedication to the future of so many Idaho 
students.

RECOGNIZING CHIEF IRA LEWIS 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Chief Ira 
Lewis, USCG (Ret.) of Harker’s Island, North 
Carolina, who passed away recently at the 
age of 101. Mr. Lewis began his career as a 
fisherman, and then joined the Coast Guard in 
1938. He served 21 years on the south shore 
of Long Island, New York, the final 31⁄2 years 
as lighthouse keeper at Montauk Lighthouse. 
After retiring from the Coast Guard and return-
ing to Harker’s Island, Ira worked for 9 years 
at Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station as a 
civilian. He continued fishing, and tended the 
local veteran’s memorial, making sure flags 
were flown and grounds were well groomed. 
In 1940 Ira married the love of his life, 
Maggie Hancock, whom he had met in the 
second grade. They had two children Ann and 
Phil, and eventually grandchildren, great- 
grandchildren, a great great-grandson. Unfor-
tunately, Maggie preceded Ira in death in 1999 
after battling cancer. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
this veteran, patriot and public servant, Chief 
Ira Lewis who valiantly carried on the storied 
tradition of courage, faithfulness and service 
that characterizes our United States Coast 
Guard. May we never forget the sacrifices 
made by those in uniform, past and present, 
and always keep our dedicated service mem-
bers in our thoughts and prayers.

NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS WEEK 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, this 
week we honor the second National Gun Vio-
lence Survivors Week. 
I rise today to lift the voices of survivors 
who live with the impact of gun violence each 
and every day. 
Every year, over 36,000 Americans are 
killed in acts of gun violence and approxi-
mately 73,330 more are shot and injured. 
Every day in America, one hundred people 
die and hundreds more are wounded by gun 
violence. Even more are threatened or witness 
gun violence. 
America’s gun death rate is 11 times greater 
than that of other developed countries. 
This is why House Democrats have passed 
commonsense legislation like H.R. 8, the Bi-
partisan Background Check Act, and H.R. 
1112, the Enhanced Background Check Act, 
to help End Gun Violence to keep our commu-
nities safe. Yet Leader MCCONNELL continues 
to block a vote on this crucial step forward. 
This is SHAMEFUL. 
The American people deserve ACTION. Not 
political gamesmanship. 
We must stop the bloodshed and the tears. 
Our children and our communities deserve 
more than just thoughts and prayers—they de-
serve action.

HILLSBORO CHAMBER OF 
COMMERCE 125TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate the Hillsboro Chamber of Com-
merce, the City of Hillsboro, and Washington 
County on the 125th anniversary of the Hills-
boro Chamber of Commerce. The City of Hills-
boro has grown from its agrarian roots to 
emerge as an economic engine in the State of 
Oregon. 
Since the Hillsboro Chamber was founded 
in 1895, it has worked tirelessly with local 
business and community leaders to bring 
greater opportunities to the people of Hills-
boro. When the Southern Pacific Railroad ar-
rived, the ability to export wheat, hops, ber-
ries, onions, and dairy helped expand a com-
mercial district in the community that eventu-
ally led to the formation of the Chamber. The 
Chamber emerged as an advocate for farmers 
and community members and, over time, the 
economic prospects of a once sleepy agrarian 
town expanded. During the Great Depression, 
the Hillsboro Chamber committed itself to uni-
fying the community in difficult financial times, 
helping to lift spirits with celebrations such as 
Happy Days, Hillsboro Bargain Days, and the 
Harvest Festival. The Chamber also helped 
the local economy survive by partnering with 
the City of Hillsboro to administer funds that 
were used to employ workers to expand run-
ways at the airport, build a post office and 
hospital, and improve a municipal water sys-
tem. These early investments in infrastructure 
have helped make Hillsboro and the sur-
rounding region a hub for the semiconductor 
and high technology industry. Silicon Forest, 
as it is known today, will continue to lead the 
way in development of new technologies and 
innovative thinking. 
Even with the expansion of the economy 
and growth of modern industry, the Chamber 
has continued to support small business own-
ers and community members, making sure 
they have the opportunity to participate in the 
growing economy. In 1995, The Hillsboro 
Chamber created the School to Career Pro-
gram, which has developed an important 
workforce pipeline to connect high school stu-
dents from schools throughout Washington 
County to career opportunities in their commu-
nities. By connecting employers to educators 
and community leaders, the Hillsboro Cham-
ber is also at the forefront of rethinking post- 
secondary opportunities for its community 
members. 
The 125th anniversary of the Hillsboro 
Chamber of Commerce is a testament to how 
a collaborative commitment between multiple 
stakeholders makes a community better for 
everyone. Although Hillsboro and the sur-
rounding region look very different now, the 
spirit of collaboration and seeking opportunity 
in Hillsboro remains the same.

RECOGNIZING LAUREL WALSH 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Laurel Walsh 
of Greenville, North Carolina. For more than 
35 years, she has been the first face people 
would see at St. Peter Catholic School. She 
answered the phone, led tours, maintained en-
rollment records, helped handle billing, and 
also served as school nurse. For 20 years she 
even served as athletic director. Not only that, 
but for all those jobs, and for all those years 
she never once brought home a paycheck. Al-
though a few people in leadership were 
aware, most in the St. Peter family thought 
Mrs. Walsh was a paid employee. Her secret 
was safe until about two months ago when the 
school established an endowment in her 
honor. In announcing the creation of the Lau-
rel Walsh Fund, school officials revealed that 
this longtime employee was, in fact, a volun-
teer. 
Teacher Joe Hughes who has worked with 
Walsh for three decades said: ‘‘She’s just so 
kind to everyone. She’s just a fine person, just 
a good example of what a human being 
should be, what Christ called us to be.’’ 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
this incredible volunteer, but more importantly, 
a wonderfully faithful servant of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, and my personal friend, Laurel 
Walsh.

Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to

Mrs. Radin are honored veterans of our great

Mr. Radin joined the United States Coast 
Guard in 1948. He served for 43 years and

ment in 1991. Chief Petty Officer Peggy Radin 
served in the Coast Guard for 20 years. Be-
tween the two of them, they devoted 63 years 
of service to America. 
Following retirement from the Coast Guard, 
Mr. and Mrs. Radin began serving their fellow 
veterans by volunteering at the Thomson- 
Hood Veteran Center in Wilmore, Kentucky. 
Mr. Radin recently completed 25 years of vol-
unteer service. In addition, for many years Mr. 
Radin has placed American flags at the 
graves of Coast Guard servicemen and 
women at Camp Nelson National Cemetery on 
the Saturday before Memorial and Veterans 
Days.

HOOSIER YOUTH CHALLENGE 
CLASS 25 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, this past De-
cember, I had the honor of serving as the key-
note speaker for the graduation of Class 25 of 
the Hoosier Youth Challenge Academy. 
Since 2007, the Hoosier Youth Challenge 
Academy has helped change the lives of 
many young men and women between the 
ages of 16 and 18, who, for one reason or an-
other, were headed down the wrong path. 
Many cadets who take part in the Hoosier 
Youth Challenge Academy program are either 
dropouts or have been expelled from school. 
For five and half months, the cadets of 
Class 25 participated in a quasi-military mod-
eled training and education program that 
teaches and instills in them a sense of dis-
cipline, responsibility, achievement and posi-
tive behavior. 
Among the group of graduates included an 
impressive 
17-year-old 
from 
Indianapolis 
named De’Von Bates. As the Distinguished 
Honor Graduate, Cadet Bates spoke to his 
peers as a leader, a role model and a 
changed young man now filled with con-
fidence, pride and strength. A sense of ac-
complishment and hope washed over the 
faces of he and his fellow graduates upon 
completion of this rigorous program, and I 
would like to include in the RECORD Cadet 
Bates’ remarks: 
‘‘Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I 
would like to start off by saying welcome to 
the Hoosier Youth ChalleNGe Academy’s 
25th graduating class. It is an honor and a 
privilege to represent this class of 60 as the 
Distinguished Honor Graduate. It is truly in-
spiring to look out at my fellow cadets and 
see just how much we have changed, both 
physically and mentally. In the beginning, 
on Day Zero, I remember waiting in line to 
get a haircut thinking, ‘‘This is not where I 
want to be.’’ By the looks around the room 
everyone else had the same exact mindset as 
me. All we had in common that day was a 
uniform and an I.D. card, and trust me: those 
pictures were not pretty. 
During Acclimation Phase we were intro-
duced to a lot of concepts and ideas we 
weren’t used to: for some it was early wake 
ups; for others it was the physical training. 
A few of us had problems with organization. 
I think I speak for us all when I say that one 
of the most challenging aspects of Acclima-
tion Phase was the time hacks. Everything, 
no matter how trivial, had a time associated 
with it. Meeting these time hacks was abso-
lutely crucial because if we failed to do so we 
got rewarded with PT, with plenty to spare. 
This made us realize that to succeed we 
needed to work as a team, and that we were 
only as strong as our weakest link. We could 
no longer act as individuals, but had to oper-
ate as a team, giving us a ‘‘one team, one 
fight’’ mindset. Thinking back to 5 months 
ago, I remember how great it felt to receive 
mail from family and friends. Those 2 weeks 
were extremely demanding, both physically 
and mentally, but because of the encourage-
ment from each other, and the constant up-
lifting notes from our loved ones, we were 
able to make it through Acclimation Phase 
and graduate with flying colors. 
A wave of relief washed over us as we grad-
uated Acclimation Phase, became cadets, 
and enjoyed the weekend. To finally get a 
phone call home for the first time since 
being gone was like a bottle of ice cold water 
on a hot summer day. These incentives that 
we had worked so hard for were a privilege, 
as compared to back at home where we took 
everything for granted. Acclimation Phase 
tore us down, but built us back up even 
stronger. 
After those two grueling weeks, we entered 
the 
ChalleNGe 
Phase 
of 
the 
program. 
Throughout the next 5 months we were being 
shaped, shifted, and molded into the best in-
dividuals that HYCA could produce. We 
started going to school learning our 8 core 
components, essential life skills needed to 
succeed in our time here and outside of 
HYCA. Then more options opened up to us: 
activities such as basketball, Color Guard, 
yearbook, and Art Club were made available 
to us to spend some extra free time we had. 
An early highlight in the program was Fam-
ily Day where we were allowed to spend a 
few hours with our loved ones. Everyone had 
an amazing time, and it was a huge stress re-
liever for all of us after being here over 2 
months. 
Soon after there were even more opportu-
nities presented to us: we took the ASVAB 
test, earned college credit, created a resume´, 
participated in a mock interview, learned job 
skills, and had a job fair to give us insight 
into which career interests we could poten-
tially have. We also gained experience by 
going on Service to Community trips. We 
learned how to be selfless by investing time 
in others, not just ourselves. 
In October we had the Tri-State Chal-
leNGe, something exciting and different 
from previous classes. We were able to inter-
act with other people our age and learn 
about some of the other ChalleNGe acad-
emies. To end such an eventful weekend, we 
also had Mentor Match, followed by weekly 
visits from our mentors. We received guid-
ance, emotional relief, and plenty of advice 
from our mentors. You have played an im-
portant role in our success here at HYCA and 
we would like to thank you for spending pre-
cious time with us. 
Finally, here we are at graduation today. 
After 51⁄2 long months, I am proud to say 
that you are looking at a group of successful 
young men and women. During our time here 
life-long friendships have been made, rela-
tionships with family members have been 
strengthened, and we have found a driving 
factor in our lives. A lot of us will leave with 
our high school equivalency, along with our 
Building Trades and Retail Sales certifi-
cations. We also take with us the confidence 
and discipline instilled within us during 
these 22 weeks. To the cadets, I want to say 
to you: congratulations! We’ve done it! We’ve 
made it through something that most people 
our age wouldn’t dare think about doing. 
Take great pride in yourself knowing that 
you have succeeded where others have failed. 
To the staff of the Hoosier Youth ChalleNGe 
Academy, a huge thanks to you all for being 
there when we needed you. Thanks for being 
here through the good and bad days, during 
the ups and the downs, and for motivating us 
to be the best that we could be when we 
couldn’t find the motivation from within 
ourselves. Thank you for being such a crit-
ical part of our success, for making us who 
we are today. Lastly, a special thanks to the 
family, friends, mentors, and loved ones: you 
stood on the sidelines, gave your best sup-
port possible through letters, phone calls, 
and constant engagement. Without you, 
some of us wouldn’t have come here to make 
a positive change in our lives, let alone be 
here on graduation day ready to start anew 
with a different, but hopeful outlook on our 
futures. Thank you again. 
President Theodore Roosevelt defined suc-
cess as ‘‘the ability to go from one failure to 
another with no loss of enthusiasm.’’ Don’t 
be discouraged by your failures, but be moti-
vated by them. We all have the ability to 
succeed; we just have to find it. I leave you 
with these words from sportscaster Ernie 
Harwell: ‘‘It’s time to say goodbye, but I 
think goodbyes are sad and I’d much rather 
say hello. Hello to a new adventure.’’ This is 
the first day of the rest of your lives. May 
you all continue to be successful in your own 
adventures, wherever they may take you! 
Thank you.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF PLANO POLICE OFFICER AR-
THUR PARKER 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, upon his 
well-deserved retirement this month, I rise 
today to recognize Plano Police Officer Arthur 
‘‘Art’’ Parker on his thirty-four years of dedi-
cated service to the City of Plano, Texas. 
During his tenure as a school resource offi-
cer, Art made headlines for his incredible abil-
ity to memorize the names of over 20,000 stu-
dents. A true public servant, and man of many 
talents, Officer Parker was often seen playing 
extravagant harmonica solos, making balloon 
animals, and most impressively, making peo-
ple laugh from their cars while stuck in school 
traffic. 
In 2015, Officer Parker was the first ever 
school resource officer to be named as Plano 
Officer of the Year. This came as no surprise 
to many inspired by his power to make others 
feel valued.

TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT FIRST 
CLASS JAVIER J. GUTIERREZ 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in honor of United States Army 
Sergeant First Class Javier J. Gutierrez who 
died on February 8, 2020, in Nangarhar Prov-
ince, Afghanistan, in support of Operation 
Freedom’s Sentinel. Sergeant First Class 
Gutierrez is from my hometown of San Anto-
nio, Texas and is survived by his wife Gabriela 
Gutierrez, four children, and parents Sylvia 
and Javier Gutierrez. I am deeply saddened 
by his passing but also confident that his 
memory will live on through his many loved 
ones and our entire community. 
Javier Jaguar Gutierrez was born in Jack-
sonville, North Carolina, on August 12, 1991. 
At an early age he demonstrated an interest in 
joining the military and following in his father’s 
footsteps. His father, Javier S. Gutierrez, 
served in the United States Marine Corps as 
an enlisted combat engineer during the Gulf 
War. His great-grandfather, Thomas Ortiz, 
served in the Army Air Forces as a bom-
bardier during World War II. He was a pris-
oner of war, taken by the Nazis after his plane 
was shot down. 
Shortly after graduating from Luther Bur-
bank High School in 2009, Gutierrez enlisted 
in the United States Army, where he was sta-
tioned at the 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute 
Infantry Regiment at Fort Bragg, North Caro-
lina. He later went on to attend Special Forces 
assessment and selection, graduating in 2015 
as a Communications Sergeant and assign-
ment at the 3rd Battalion, 7th Special Forces 
Airborne Group at Eglin Air Force Base of 
Florida. 
Sergeant First Class Gutierrez was a person 
of high quality whose humility was only 
matched by his commitment to service. During 
his 11 years of remarkable service, he re-
ceived several awards, which included the 
Army Commendation Medal; Army Achieve-
ment Medal; Good Conduct Medal; National 
Defense Service Medal; Iraq Campaign Medal; 
Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; Non-
commissioned Officer Professional Develop-
ment Ribbon; Army Service Ribbon; Expert In-
fantry and Parachutist Badges; and the Spe-
cial Forces Tab. Sergeant First Class Gutier-
rez was posthumously awarded the Bronze 
Star Medal, the Purple Heart, and promoted to 
the rank of Sergeant 1st Class. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize 
the life and service of a person who dedicated 
themselves to family and country above all 
else. The entire San Antonio community 
mourns the loss of an American hero. We will 
be forever indebted to this true patriot whose 
sacrifice cannot be measured. I thank Ser-
geant First Class Gutierrez for his service, his 
bravery, and for his unending commitment to 
our great country.

HONORING RANDY ROUTON 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize Mr. Randy Routon for his nearly 
thirty-four years of dedicated service as the 
Executive Director of LifePath Systems. 
Created in 1986 as the community MHMR 
for Collin County, LifePath Systems serves as 
the Local Intellectual and Developmental Dis-
abilities Authority and Local Behavioral Health 
Authority 
for 
Collin 
County. 
Under 
Mr. 
Routon’s steadfast leadership, the organiza-
tion provides community-based services for 
over 1,100 infants, toddler, and families in 
Collin, Rockwall, Kaufman, Grayson, and 
Fannin Counties through their Early Childhood 
Intervention program. Further, each month the 
organization provides Behavioral Health serv-
ices to approximately 3,800 Collin County resi-
dents and Intellectual and Developmental Dis-
ability Services to over 1,700 individuals. 
As the CEO for LifePath, Randy supervises 
over 450 hardworking employees and over 
350 private contractors stationed in 11 facili-
ties and homes, tasked with interfacing with 
state and local agencies. 
Mr. Routon previously served as the Execu-
tive Director of Mental Health Services in 
Collin County, as a former administrator at 
Children’s Hospital of New Orleans, and as an 
instructor at Texas Women’s University in 
Denton. Randy also served multiple terms as 
an 
elected 
Regional 
Representative 
and 
Treasurer on the Board of Directors for Texas 
Community Solutions, as a Regional Director 
for the National Therapeutic Recreation Soci-
ety Board, and is currently serving as the 
Texas Council of Community Centers Execu-
tive Directors Liaison to Texas Early Child-
hood Intervention Providers. 
Randy has helped shape Collin County 
through his work on the Advisory Board for the 
Health Care Committee, the Collin County 
Special Task Unit for Adult Protective Serv-
ices, the Executive Board of the Coalition for 
Behavioral Health, and as a grant writer for 
various public and private organizations. Addi-
tionally, Mr. Routon has inspired countless 
others as a Paul Harris Fellow and Community 
Services Director for the McKinney Rotary 
Club. 
Randy and his wife, Diane, are the proud 
parents of six children and six grandchildren, 
with whom he looks forward to enjoying a rest-
ful retirement with. 
As Randy prepares to begin a new season 
of life, I ask my colleagues in the United 
States House of Representatives to join me in 
recognizing Mr. Randy Routon for his selfless 
and dedicated career as the Executive Direc-
tor for LifePath Systems and to wish him well 
in his future endeavors.
