HONORING SPC. VANESSA 
GUILLE´ N 
HON. SYLVIA R. GARCIA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor my constituent, Specialist 
(Spc.) Vanessa Guille´n—a daughter, a sister, 
and a beloved member of the Southeast 
Houston community. She was a beautiful, tal-
ented, and intelligent 20-year old Latina sol-
dier who tragically went missing on April 22, 
2020 after she was brutally murdered by an-
other soldier at Fort Hood. 
Spc. Vanessa Guille´n was born on Sep-
tember 30, 1999 to her loving parents Rogelio 
and Gloria Guille´n, and was one of six broth-
ers and sisters. Her father Rogelio likes to re-
count the story of how Vanessa dreamed of 
joining the U.S. Army since she was 12 years 
old. She would often tell him, ‘‘Papa´ yo me 
quiero inscribir en el Army. I want to enlist in 
the Army.’’ She felt a deep sense of love for 
America and the Army represented an oppor-
tunity for a better life—her shot at achieving 
the American Dream. She worked really hard 
towards this goal and in 2018 she graduated 
in the top 15 percent of her class from Ce´sar 
E. Cha´vez High School where she loved play-
ing soccer. Shortly after her graduation, 
Vanessa fulfilled her dream to serve our coun-
try by enlisting in the Army where she was 
trained as a 91F, small arms/artillery repairer. 
Unfortunately, her dream turned into a true 
nightmare. Before her murder and disappear-
ance, Vanessa confided in her family that she 
felt unsafe at Fort Hood due to experiences 
with sexual harassment. She did not file a re-
port out of fear of retaliation. The Army failed 
her and the Guille´n family, and all those re-
sponsible for this failure must be held respon-
sible. 
Vanessa did not deserve to die the way she 
did, and her story has hit so many of us in our 
hearts, especially in the Latino community of 
Houston. We mourn with the Guille´n family be-
cause Vanessa was one of us. So many of us 
have sisters, daughters, nieces, cousins, and 
friends who could have easily been Vanessa 
because so many Latinas have answered the 
call to serve our country. 
Unfortunately, 
Vanessa’s 
story 
is 
not 
unique. In response to this case, current and 
former Latina servicemembers have dem-
onstrated incredible bravery in sharing their 
experiences with sexual harassment and as-
sault in the military. Their stories reinforce the 
troubling 
reality 
that 
too 
often 
female 
servicemembers do not report their sexual 
trauma because they fear how their chain of 
command will respond. This is not only wrong, 
but Vanessa’s story has galvanized efforts 
across the country to put an end to a culture 
that perpetuates sexual assault and harass-
ment in the military. We must seize this oppor-
tunity to ensure this never happens again to 
another soldier or their family. 
Madam Speaker, the Guille´n family, current 
and former female servicemembers, and ev-
eryone in the Houston region, myself included, 
ask that we make sure that what happened to 
Vanessa Guille´n never happens again, so not 
one more family has to suffer like the Guille´ns 
have. 
We want justice for Vanessa Guille´n. 
Nosotros queremos justicia para Vanessa 
Guille´n.

TO 
RECOGNIZE 
EVA 
BENEDICT 
UPON 
RECEIVING 
THE 
NEW 
YORK 
STATE 
SENATE 
2020 
WOMEN OF DISTINCTION HONOR 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize Eva Benedict upon her receiving the 
New York State Senate 2020 Women of Dis-
tinction Honor. 
Eva Benedict has served the Wellsville com-
munity for almost forty years in healthcare, 
starting as a Critical Care Staff Nurse in 1981 
at Jones Memorial Hospital. She held various 
positions in administration and management 
and was ultimately appointed as President and 
Chief Executive Officer in 2007. 
In 2015, Eva was instrumental in the hos-
pital’s affiliation with the University of Roch-
ester Medical Center. To this day, she serves 
both Jones Memorial and the University as a 
member of the affiliate leadership team. 
In 2018, her leadership earned the 2018 
Grassroots Champion Award from the Amer-
ican Hospital Association in partnership with 
the Healthcare Association of New York State. 
Throughout her years at the hospital, Eva has 
dedicated her time and energy to helping this 
rural hospital navigate through difficult areas, 
providing the best medical services possible 
and giving community members reliable, trust-
ed care that they need. 
During my time in office, I have appreciated 
building a trusted relationship with Eva and I 
have greatly valued her expertise in the 
healthcare field. My office has regularly called 
on her for honest, educated feedback, and we 
continue to rely on her for that today. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
recognize Eva Benedict upon her receiving the 
New York State Senate 2020 Women of Dis-
tinction Honor.

HONORING NEIGHBORS IN NEED 
OF SERVICES (NINOS), INC. 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the Neighbors In Need of Services 
(NINOS), Inc. as the organization celebrates 
30 years of service to the community. 
Since its foundation in August 1990, NINOS 
Head Start and Early Head Start programs 
have ensured that low-income South Texas 
families have access to needed educational, 
medical, and nutritional support for children 
from birth to four years old. In addition to pre-
paring children to begin pre-school, NINOS 
provides pre- and post-natal education to ex-
pectant mothers. 
The NINOS mission statement is ‘‘Creating 
a brighter future for the children and la 
familia.’’ In the past 30 years NINOS has 
served approximately 50,000 children, an in-
credible accomplishment that no doubt has 
had a lasting impact for these children and 
their families. This organization and its dedi-
cated staff help the next generation of Rio 
Grande Valley residents reach their potential 
by ensuring that every child, regardless of 
economic status, has access to the resources 
that will help them succeed in school and be-
yond. 
I am proud of NINOS and the contributions 
they have made to the Rio Grande Valley for 
the past 30 years. I look forward to seeing 
how they continue to help our community grow 
stronger. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
U.S. House of Representatives to join me and 
the people of the 34th District of Texas in hon-
oring an organization that is committed to the 
selfless and important work of educating our 
children and ensuring families have the help 
and support they need to thrive. NINOS 
serves as an outstanding example of how we 
all should serve our neighbors and community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE STEM 
EDUCATOR AWARDS EQUITY ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the STEM Educator Awards Equity 
Act to ensure educators from the Northern 
Mariana Islands, Virgin Islands, Guam, and 
American Samoa are represented in the an-
nual Presidential Awards for Excellence in 
Math and Science Teaching. 
Established by Congress in 1983, the Presi-
dential Award is the highest recognition that 
an elementary or secondary school mathe-
matics or science teacher may receive in the 
United States. Over 4,800 teachers have been 
recognized for their contributions in the class-
room and to their profession. 
Unlike the fifty States, the District of Colum-
bia, Puerto Rico and Department of Defense 
schools, each of which may recognize a 
STEM educator, no more than two awards in 
total can go to teachers from the four insular 
areas: the Northern Mariana Islands, the Vir-
gin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. This 
limitation has resulted in many years in which 
no teacher from one of those four areas is se-
lected. No teacher from the Marianas, for in-
stance, was selected this year. And this lack 
of recognition defeats the purpose of the pro-
gram, which is to inspire excellence within 
each area and provide a role model for other

local STEM educators to emulate. These stat-
utory limits, also, unfairly deny deserving edu-
cators in the insular areas the national rec-
ognition and professional development oppor-
tunities we provide to STEM educators else-
where in our nation. 
My bill provides a more equitable process 
by requiring awards to at least one teacher 
from each of the four areas. By ensuring 
teachers from all parts of America are rep-
resented, more students and schools will ben-
efit from the expert-led training programs and 
collaboration opportunities available to award-
ees during their visit to our nation’s capital. 
The gentlewoman from American Samoa, 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN and the gentleman from 
Guam, Mr. SAN NICOLAS, are original cospon-
sors of the bill. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation.

MAJOR JAMES CAPERS, JR. 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor one of the greatest heroes our coun-
try has ever seen in combat—my constituent, 
and Lee County’s very own, Major James Ca-
pers, Jr. 
Many may not know who Major Capers Jr. 
is, but he became the first black Marine officer 
nominated for the Medal of Honor and ulti-
mately received the Silver Star. 
He is not only a hero in the Marine Corps, 
but also for his unwavering service in the Spe-
cial Operations community, as well. Born in 
Bishopville, South Carolina, in the era of Jim 
Crow, Major Capers willingly enlisted in the 
military to serve a nation that did not have his 
interest at heart. That, in itself, is heroism. 
Regardless, after finding a home in the Ma-
rine Corps, he became the first African Amer-
ican to get a battlefield commission in the Ma-
rine Corps Force Recon and was promoted 
from Staff Sergeant to Second Lieutenant, giv-
ing him control over the unit. 
During the Vietnam War, Capers’ team, who 
called themselves ‘‘Team Broadminded’’ con-
ducted covert missions many of which nearly 
took his life to save his men. Soon after, Major 
Capers, a trailblazer for African Americans in 
the Marine Corps, became the face of their re-
cruiting campaign called ‘‘Ask a Marine.’’ 
Capers lost his wife and son to cancer, both 
of whom are buried in Arlington National Cem-
etery, but he still regularly receives visits from 
his fellow soldiers and other young Marines. 
However, he finally got the recognition he 
rightfully deserved. In 2010, Major James Ca-
pers Jr. was one of only 14 members inducted 
into the inaugural class of U.S. Special Oper-
ations Command’s Commando Hall of Honor 
at a ceremony in front of USSOCOM head-
quarters at MacDill Air Force Base. 
Between the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, 
the Purple Heart, and countless other medals, 
Major James Capers, Jr. exemplifies what it 
truly means to be a hero—it is not the medals, 
but someone who stands face to face with ad-
versity and is willing to sacrifice his own life 
for those of his brothers in Christ. 
It is my hope that every person of future 
generations can see and hear of his story, and 
be willing to do what he has done, and that is 
to be a hero. With that Madam Speaker, it is 
my honor and privilege to recognize Major 
James Capers, Jr.

SUPPORTING EARLY-CAREER 
RESEARCHERS ACT 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I am joined by my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives LUCAS, BEYER, GARCIA, LIPINSKI, 
BONAMICI, TONKO, and COHEN, in introducing 
the Supporting Early-Career Researchers Act. 
Our nation’s research enterprise is reeling 
from the unprecedented disruptions caused by 
the COVID–19 crisis. To slow the spread of 
the virus, universities across the country have 
been forced to cancel in-person classes and 
shut down campus operations. And today, six 
months into this crisis and with no relief in 
sight, universities are once again faced with 
impossible decisions about the upcoming aca-
demic year. 
I want to thank universities for their commit-
ment to doing their part to slow the spread of 
the virus and for their commitment to ensuring 
the safety of their students, faculty, and staff. 
In the absence of clear guidance or a national 
strategy from this Administration, universities 
have stepped up to donate personal protective 
equipment, reconfigure laboratory space and 
equipment for COVID–19 research, institute 
social distancing measures, transition to re-
mote education, provide for testing and con-
tact tracing, and accommodate the needs of 
international students. 
These actions, while laudable, have come at 
a cost. The full extent of the financial loss in-
curred by universities during this crisis is un-
knowable at this point. Recent surveys of uni-
versity presidents conducted by the American 
Council of Education reveal that short- and 
long-term financial viability are pressing con-
cerns. And, in order to stave off catastrophe, 
many universities have instituted hiring freezes 
and cancelled new faculty hires. 
I am deeply concerned about the disappear-
ance of STEM job opportunities and the po-
tential long-term consequences for our STEM 
pipeline. For established researchers, the 
COVID–19 crisis has severely limited their ac-
cess to their laboratory space. But for early 
career researchers, these disruptions come at 
a critical juncture in their research career, 
threatening to derail their career path. 
Even in normal times, postdoctoral research 
positions provide little job security, with most 
postdocs employed on two-year contracts. 
Now that the research job market has severely 
contracted, postdocs find themselves in a truly 
precarious position. Many of them may be 
forced to abandon their career path altogether 
in order to support themselves and their fami-
lies. 
The Supporting Early-Career Researchers 
Act establishes a $250 million postdoctoral fel-
lowship pilot program at the National Science 
Foundation. This program would provide a 
much-needed bridge to help early career re-
searchers weather this storm and prevent a 
permanent loss of STEM talent our nation can 
ill afford. I look forward to moving this bill 
quickly and working with my colleagues on the 
Appropriations committee to ensure it is fund-
ed.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HEALTH 
CENTER WEEK 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, our nation 
is fighting multiple crises at once: the risks of 
COVID–19 on our health and the health of our 
friends and neighbors, the dire economic im-
pacts of communities halted to keep us each 
safe, and the surge of racial justice move-
ments across the United States and the world. 
During these times of difficulty and change, I 
find myself turning to the institutions in our 
communities that have always worked to ad-
dress each of these crises, individually and as 
a whole—Community Health Centers. 
This week we honor the work of Community 
Health Centers during National Health Center 
Week. As we contemplate a path forward of 
safety, health, prosperity, and equity in our 
country, our conversations must begin and 
end with the CHCs that have been stalwart 
providers of accessible healthcare for every in-
dividual who needed it. 
Each and every day, CHCs provide care for 
some of our nation’s most vulnerable folks. In 
2018 in Colorado, CHCs served over 200,000 
children, nearly 32,000 individuals without 
homes, and over 9,500 veterans. Overall, they 
served nearly 650,000 patients in my state 
who might have otherwise been unable to ac-
cess or afford health care. 
CHCs provide irreplaceable healthcare serv-
ices, but they are also economic drivers during 
this time of unprecedented financial hardship: 
For every $1 in federal investments, CHCs 
generated $5.85 in economic activity across 
Colorado. In total, health centers in Colorado 
deliver $1.38 billion in economic activity, eco-
nomic benefits the likes of which can be found 
in states across the U.S. 
And as the COVID–19 pandemic continues, 
CHCs have risen to the challenge, innovating 
constantly to keep providing excellent care to 
their patients and communities. 
I have no doubt that we can and we will 
overcome the struggles presented to us as 
Coloradans, and as Americans. To do this, it 
will take robust support for the tried and true 
systems of healthcare that efficiently, yet hum-
bly serve our communities every day. That is 
why I’m so proud to recognize the work of 
Community Health Centers in my home state 
and across the United States this week and 
every week. 
I thank the doctors, nurses, dentists, behav-
ioral health specialists, and the countless 
other workers who ensure the success of 
CHCs and the health and wellbeing of our 
communities.

RECOGNIZING 
KENT 
CHRISTENSEN’S 
DISTINGUISHED 
CAREER IN THE CONGRESSIONAL 
BUDGET OFFICE 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor and recognize Kent 
Christensen, who retired at the end of July 
after 34 years of exceptional service to the 
Congress at the Congressional Budget Office. 
Kent began his Congressional career in CBO’s 
Budget Analysis Division in 1986 where he 
worked as a principal analyst in the Defense, 
International Affairs, and Veterans’ Affairs 
Cost Estimates Unit. 
During his time at CBO, Kent was recog-
nized as an exceptionally thoughtful and 
knowledgeable analyst. As one of the longest 
tenured members of CBO’s Budget Analysis 
Division, he accrued extensive knowledge of 
the programs and accounts in his portfolio and 
a broad understanding of many other federal 
programs and the federal budget process in 
general. Kent was a valued colleague, passing 
along his knowledge to new and experienced 
analysts alike and encouraging a supportive 
environment where analysts respect each 
other and work well together. 
Kent has also earned the respect of his 
counterparts on the staffs of the Armed Serv-
ices, Budget, and Appropriations committees 
thanks to his thoroughness, meticulous atten-
tion to detail, and incredible memory. He 
worked closely with the staff of the Armed 
Services Committees for more than three dec-
ades, particularly on annual proposals of the 
National Defense Authorization Act. His acu-
men when estimating the budgetary effects of 
and providing technical feedback on legislative 
proposals has helped ensure enactment of the 
National Defense Authorization Act each year. 
With his departure, the Congressional Budg-
et Office loses a great asset. Over the past 34 
years, CBO—and by extension, the Congress 
itself—has been fortunate to enjoy the dedica-
tion and insight that Kent has brought to his 
work. I know my colleagues join me in extend-
ing our thanks and appreciation to Kent for his 
service to our nation and our very best wishes 
for a happy and productive retirement. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to con-
gratulate Kent Christensen on his well-earned 
retirement from the Congressional Budget Of-
fice and recognize his outstanding work on the 
National Defense Authorization Act.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
OF 
FAMOUS 
HAM-
BURGER 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Famous Hamburger as it celebrates its fiftieth 
anniversary. Its years of service to the com-
munity are worthy of commendation. 
After returning to Beirut, Lebanon from the 
United States, Phillip Hider and his father de-
veloped the idea to start a burger joint in Leb-
anon. In 1968, they two opened their first res-
taurant called ‘‘Little White Castle,’’ which 
quickly transformed into a famous local favor-
ite. After relocating to a new spot in Downtown 
Beirut, the decision was made to change the 
name to reflect its widespread popularity, re-
sulting in the Famous Hamburger brand being 
officially established in 1970. Years later, 
Hider and his family chose to move to the 
United States to seek a better life and greater 
opportunity, and soon found themselves in 
Michigan in 1989. In March of 1997, Hider in-
troduced the first Famous Hamburger in De-
troit, and later relocated to a larger location in 
Dearborn in July of 2005. As in Lebanon, Fa-
mous Hamburger quickly became a beloved 
institution among the metro Detroit community. 
Today, it has locations spanning the region, 
such as Dearborn, Canton, and Auburn Hills. 
For half a century, Famous Hamburger has 
been cherished by people across both Leb-
anon and Michigan. In Dearborn, the res-
taurant has become a beloved community sta-
ple. Its welcoming environment, dedicated 
staff, and quality meals have drawn our com-
munity together, and its burgers are recog-
nized as one of the best across Michigan. 
Many patrons are regulars who have fre-
quented the restaurant for years, and even 
newcomers are made to feel like life-long 
friends. In the midst of the coronavirus pan-
demic, the fiftieth anniversary of Famous 
Hamburgers have given our Dearborn commu-
nity a reason to celebrate. It has provided a 
sense of comfort, unity, and normalcy in a 
time of unprecedented strife. Famous Ham-
burger’s demonstrated commitment to serving 
Dearborn is immensely appreciated and is 
something we all should strive to emulate. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of Fa-
mous Hamburger. We are grateful for its years 
of dedicated service, and wish the restaurant 
continued success in the year ahead. 
INTRODUCING 
THE 
ISRAELI 
AN-
NEXATION 
NON-RECOGNITION 
ACT TO PROTECT THE PALES-
TINIAN PEOPLE AND PROMOTE 
PEACE 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, yester-
day, with the announcement of the agreement 
between Israel and the United Arab Emirates 
to normalize diplomatic relations, Speaker 
PELOSI
issued a statement regarding the 
news. An important sentence in the statement 
was powerful, necessary, and correct: ‘‘The 
House continues to object to steps including 
unilateral annexation that will undermine future 
efforts to advance a just, stable, and lasting 
peace in the Middle East.’’ 
I agree. 
For years, the centerpiece of Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s political agen-
da has been his explicit desire and intent to 
unilaterally annex as much as 30 percent of 
Palestinian territory in the West Bank. He calls 
it a ‘‘historic opportunity.’’ Even though annex-
ation is a clear violation of international law 
and the fundamental rights of the Palestinian 
people, the Trump administration, along with 
right-wing Jewish groups and extremists in the 
evangelical Christian community in the U.S., 
allies of Netanyahu, have championed annex-
ation. 
Millions of Palestinians have lived for dec-
ades under Israel’s military occupation. Now 
the Palestinian people fear that any hope for 
self-determination or the opportunity to live 
with dignity, equality, and justice will be extin-
guished through the annexation of their land 
by Israel with the support of an American 
president. 
Today, I am introducing legislation in the 
U.S. House—the Israeli Annexation Non-Rec-
ognition Act—to prohibit appropriated U.S. 
funds from being directed to any area in the 
occupied West Bank annexed by Israel. I want 
Palestinians and Israelis to have their human 
rights respected, their right to self-determina-
tion realized, and a future with peace, security, 
equality, and justice. Annexation is antithetical 
to these goals and will fuel conflict, injustice, 
and an abhorrent system of apartheid. This is 
an 
intolerable 
outcome 
for 
Palestinians, 
Israelis, and Americans. 
I reject annexation. I condemn annexation. 
And, I will work to ensure the U.S. does not 
support, defend, or legitimize any plan or ac-
tion by Israel to illegally annex Palestinian 
lands. 
Yesterday’s diplomatic agreement between 
Israel and the UAE changes nothing. Mr. 
Netanyahu and Mr. Trump have taken nothing 
off the table. Their promises and commitments 
are worthless. They have both proven time 
and time again that they cannot be trusted. 
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz ran a head-
line today citing comments from the U.S. Am-
bassador to Israel that makes it clear annex-
ation is still being contemplated by Israeli and 
U.S. officials at the highest levels. Referring to 
annexation, the headline read, ‘‘Pro-settler 
Ambassador Friedman argues ‘it’s not off the 
table permanently’ after historic agreement to 
normalize relations between Israel and the 
UAE.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

August 14, 2020 
The same Haaretz article, included for the 
RECORD, cited Prime Minister Netanyahu say-
ing annexation is ‘‘still on the table’’ and that 
‘‘extending sovereignty will be done only 
alongside the United States.’’ A senior Israeli 
political source is quoted as saying, ‘‘Applying 
sovereignty (to the West Bank) is on the table 
and we’re committed to it.’’ 
Again, nothing has changed. The annex-
ation of Palestinian lands must be stopped 
and must never be aided or abetted by any 
U.S. administration. The Palestinian people 
should be fully engaged diplomatically by the 
next U.S. president as partners and construc-
tive peacemakers empowered to negotiate 
and determine their own political and eco-
nomic future. Never again should the people 
of Palestine be ignored, isolated, and boy-
cotted as the Trump administration has done. 
Democrats in Congress, led by the coura-
geous and righteous co-sponsors of this bill, 
must act to send an unambiguous message 
that annexation is contrary to U.S. interests 
and would devastate the U.S.-lsrael bilateral 
relationship. The Palestinian people deserve 
the support of Congress and the American 
people in this dark moment. If our nation is 
truly a beacon of democracy, then let us use 
our power for good to protect the Palestinian 
people from Mr. Netanyahu’s illegal annex-
ation.

AFTER NETANYAHU COMMITS TO FUTURE AN-
NEXATION, TRUMP SAYS IT’S ‘NOW OFF THE 
TABLE’ 
(By Noa Landau) 
PRO-SETTLER AMBASSADOR FRIEDMAN ARGUES 
‘IT’S
NOT
OFF
THE
TABLE
PERMANENTLY’ 
AFTER HISTORIC AGREEMENT TO NORMALIZE 
RELATIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE UAE 
U.S. President Donald Trump said Thurs-
day night that Israel made a ‘great conces-
sion’ by agreeing to suspend West Bank an-
nexation as part of its agreement to nor-
malize relations with the United Arab Emir-
ates, adding that for now ‘it’s off the table.’ 
Earlier on Thursday, Israel and the UAE 
reached a historic peace deal on that would 
lead to a full normalization of diplomatic re-
lations between the two Middle Eastern na-
tions in an agreement that Trump helped 
broker. 
‘‘Israel agreed not to annex parts of the 
West Bank. It is more than taking it off the 
table—they agreed not to do it. This is a 
very smart concession by Israel. It is off the 
table now,’’ Trump said during a White 
House briefing. 
This comes in contrast to Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu’s earlier remarks that 
annexation is ‘‘still on the table,’’ and that 
it is a pledge the prime minister said he is 
‘‘committed to.’’ 
In addition, an Israeli senior political 
source said that ‘‘Applying sovereignty [to 
the West Bank] is on the table and we’re 
committed to it. The Trump administration 
requested to temporarily suspend the an-
nouncement [of annexation] to first imple-
ment the historic peace agreement with the 
UAE.’’ 
Asked about Netanyahu’s statement that 
he considers this a ‘temporary suspension,’ 
and that the option of annexation will still 
exist in the future, Trump responded that 
‘‘Right now it’s off the table, I can’t talk 
about sometime in the future, that’s a big 
statement, but right now it’s off the table.’’ 
U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, 
however, said that ‘‘it’s off the table now but 
it’s not off the table permanently. You can’t 
have peace and annexation at the same 
time.’’ 
Speaking in a televised speech earlier on 
Thursday, Netanyahu said that ‘‘Today 
marks a new era in Israel’s relations with 
the Arab world’’ and that the two countries 
agreed on ‘‘a full, formal peace.’’ 
‘‘For years, Israel has been portrayed as an 
enemy . . . now more countries will join us 
in this circle of peace,’’ the prime minister 
said. 
He added that annexation is ‘‘still on the 
table,’’ and that it is a promise Netanyahu 
said he is ‘‘committed to.’’. 
‘‘Extending sovereignty will be done only 
alongside the United States,’’ Netanyahu 
said. ‘‘Without coordination, in the best 
case, will do nothing, and in the worst case, 
will harm relations between us. The United 
States asked that Israel temporarily post-
pone annexation.’’

HONORING THE LIFE OF BEAU-
MONT POLICE OFFICER SHEENA 
DAE YARBROUGH-POWELL 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life 
and legacy of Beaumont Police Officer 
Sheena Dae Yarbrough-Powell, who tragically 
perished in the line of duty on August 9, 2020. 
Sheena Dae Yarbrough-Powell was born on 
November 22, 1996, in Nederland, Texas to 
Mark and Shelia Yarbrough. She was the fifth 
of six girls and remained very close to her 
family. Highlights of family time included: Sun-
day lunches, yearly vacations, sleepovers with 
sisters, competing with family and friends in 
board games, and, of course, ‘‘lots of Blue 
Bell Ice Cream.’’ According to family and 
friends, Sheena never met a stranger, was a 
social butterfly, and would tire herself trying to 
make everyone feel included. Sheena grad-
uated from Lumberton High School in 2015. 
Sheena’s faith and family were her top prior-
ities. She was a member of Calvary Baptist 
Church where she developed many life-long 
friends. Her love of Jesus was evident in how 
she lived her life and treated others. After be-
coming involved with Calvary’s Renewal Bible 
study, she met the love of her life, Tyler Pow-
ell. From their first date in June of 2018, until 
her untimely death, Sheena and Tyler were in-
separable. The two were married on October 
4, 2019, in Beaumont, Texas. In their 10 
months of marriage, Sheena was a faithful 
and loving wife who provided Tyler with a life-
time of great memories. 
In 2018, after graduating from Lamar Uni-
versity with a bachelor’s degree in Criminal 
Justice, Sheena entered the LIT Police Acad-
emy. She was hired by the Beaumont Police 
Department as a Cadet on August 13, 2018 
and was sworn in as a Beaumont Police Offi-
cer on December 20, 2018. Her family, 
friends, and fellow officers lovingly referred to 
her as ‘‘Officer Hopps.’’ As an officer, Sheena 
was passionate about preventing sex crimes 
and helping victims of human trafficking. Be-
coming a police officer gave Sheena the ability 
to make a difference in her community and 
touch the lives of every individual she met. 
Officer Yarbrough-Powell is survived by her 
husband, Tyler; her parents, Mark and Shelia 
Yarbrough; her sisters, Jennifer Rae, Jessica 
Mae, Samantha Fae, Sarah Kae, and Madison 
Jae; her grandmother, Dorothy Yarbrough; 
and parents in-law, Rick and Deidre Powell, 
along with many friends and family whom she 
loved dearly. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Beau-
mont Police Officer Sheena Dae Yarbrough- 
Powell for her faithful service to her commu-
nity. My thoughts and prayers remain with her 
family, friends, and her law enforcement family 
during this difficult time.

WOMAN’S CLUB OF ROCK HILL— 
CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE 19TH AMEND-
MENT 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in celebration of the 100th Anniversary of 
Women’s Right to Vote. 
The Nineteenth Amendment, enshrined in 
our constitution, lifted millions of women closer 
to equality in all aspects of American life. 
The right to vote raised women across the 
nation to an equal footing in the laws and poli-
tics that govern them. 
In my hometown of Rock Hill, South Caro-
lina, The Woman’s Club of Rock Hill will be 
celebrating that hard-earned right. 
The Woman’s Club of Rock Hill was orga-
nized in 1939 and is affiliated with some of the 
largest and oldest women’s volunteer service 
organizations in the world. 
The Woman’s Club of Rock Hill serves our 
community with distinction. In the very best 
tradition of civil society, the Club strives to fur-
ther the cultural, educational and social inter-
est of its members, to promote action in civic 
development, social welfare, and to preserve 
its historic property. 
Much work remains until the equality be-
tween man and woman is fully realized, but 
we should never forget the example set by the 
historic Suffragette movement, enabled by or-
ganizations like the Woman’s Club of Rock 
Hill, that did so much to advance the rights of 
women. 
I am proud to honor the 19th Amendment 
that elevated more than 26 million women 
from subjects to citizens, thereby bestowing 
them the means to empower themselves, their 
families, and all communities. 
The importance of this amendment to our 
society cannot be overstated. Today, I want to 
thank the Woman’s Club of Rock Hill for orga-
nizing such a special event and take the time 
to honor all women.

Chuck has been a key part of the team at 
the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commis-
sion, directing government affairs and serving 
as an absolutely indispensable resource on 
tribal fisheries policy and services for the 
Yakama, Warm Springs, Umatilla, and Nez 
Perce tribes. This has meant that we have col-
laborated on any number of issues and 
projects, from creating the Columbia River 
Basin Restoration Act to righting historic 
wrongs done by the federal government with 
respect to tribal housing along the Columbia. 
Along the way, Chuck has been a tremendous 
partner in engaging not just my office, but the 
entire Pacific Northwest delegation in advanc-
ing the fisheries and related priorities of the 
four Columbia River Treaty tribes. He is an ex-
traordinarily trusted, knowledgeable, and effec-
tive advocate. The work that he’s done will 
benefit tribal communities for generations to 
come. 
My connection to Chuck is deeper than 
most, as I’ve also had the pleasure of working 
closely with his son, Stone, who served as an 
intern in my office and then on my staff. It’s 
been a true honor to work with Stone, who, 
like Chuck, is a skilled communicator, a dedi-
cated professional, and an engaged member 
of the community. I have deeply appreciated 
the opportunity to partner with both of these 
wonderful people on many initiatives. 
I congratulate Chuck on his retirement and 
thank him for his tremendous service to tribal 
communities in the Pacific Northwest, I am 
proud to call him my friend and co-collabo-
rator. I look forward to continuing to work to-
gether, as he writes the next chapter of his re-
markable life.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ERIC 
JASON AMBERGE 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mr. Eric Jason Amberge, who 
passed away on July 13, 2020. A veteran, 
proud volunteer, and beloved husband, father, 
grandfather, and friend, Mr. Amberge will be 
dearly missed. 
After graduating from SUNY Fredonia with a 
degree in Electrical Engineering, Mr. Amberge 
entered the United States Air Force. During 
his time in the military, Mr. Amberge was sta-
tioned at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, NY, 
where he served as a Lead Systems Engineer 
and Air Defense Initiatives and Program Man-
ager, at the Advanced Planning System in 
Rome Laboratory, Airforce System Command. 
After 10 years in the Air Force, Mr. Amberge 
retired as a Captain and was awarded the 
Meritorious Service Medal for Outstanding 
Service, a distinction given to those who 
preform volunteer service that far exceed the 
duties required by a member of the Armed 
Services. 
Following his retirement from the Air Force, 
Mr. Amberge went on to receive an MBA from 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. During his 
career as an engineer, he worked for Kodak, 
Oracle, APG Technologies, and Aquila Tech-
nologies. 
Outside of work, Mr. Amberge was an avid 
volunteer who was passionate about honoring 
local veterans. He served as Commander of 
the Skaneateles American Legion Post No. 
239 and as the Director of Honor Flight Syra-
cuse, an organization that transports local vet-
erans to Washington, DC, allowing them to 
visit the national memorials dedicated to their 
service and sacrifice. Throughout his life, he 
also remained dedicated to his wife, children 
and step-children, mother, siblings, and grand-
children. A man of strong faith, Mr. Amberge 
was an avid student of scripture and strived to 
always treat others with dignity and respect. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House to join me in honoring the life of Mr. 
Eric Jason Amberge. A cherished member of 
our 
Central 
New 
York 
community, 
Mr. 
Amberge will truly be missed. I ask my col-
leagues to keep him and his family in mind as 
we remember his life.

CELEBRATING THE SERVICE OF 
PATRICK KEPLINGER 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Patrick Keplinger, a member of my staff 
who has contributed over 20 years of excep-
tional service to our Country. 
Patrick was commissioned as an officer in 
2001 and served two tours in Operation Iraqi 
Freedom before achieving the rank of Major in 
the United States Marine Corps. In 2015, Pat-
rick made his way to the House of Represent-
atives, where he joined my team as a Wound-
ed Warrior fellow. In this role, Patrick helped 
fellow veterans navigate the Department of 
Veterans’ Affairs and access the benefits they 
have earned and deserve. Later that year, he 
became a permanent staff member in my 
Hemet office, where he has since served as a 
field representative. For the past five years, 
Patrick has worked diligently to address the 
military’s use of toxic burn pits and advocate 
for veterans in our community. 
One of Patrick’s most significant accom-
plishments in my office was the case of Jen-
nifer Kepner, a 39-year-old veteran from Ca-
thedral City. Jennifer served in Operation Iraqi 
Freedom, and in 2016 was diagnosed with 
Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer. Her doctors de-
termined that her exposure to burn pits during 
her deployment was the cause of her cancer. 
The VA denied her claim for compensation, 
but Patrick helped her obtain 100 percent 
service-connected compensation. Additionally, 
Patrick helped bring the burn pit issue to the 
forefront, resulting in my burn pit bill, H.R. 
4137, the Jennifer Kepner HOPE Act. To-
gether, we continue to work to bring national 
attention to this issue. 
Patrick’s passion for serving our Country is 
not ending but starting a new chapter. He will 
be working at Camp Pendleton Marine Corps 
Base in San Diego, where he will help active 
duty service members transition back to civil-
ian life. I believe Patrick is perfect for this be-
cause wherever Patrick is, there is a purpose. 
On behalf of our entire community, I thank 
Patrick, for his exceptional continued service 
and wish Big Marine good luck with his future 
endeavors. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLES 
BATTISE ‘‘C.B.’’ CELESTINE 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of Vietnam War vet-
eran Charles Battise ‘‘C.B.’’ Celestine, who 
passed away on Wednesday, April 22, 2020, 
at the age of 84. Mr. Celestine was a long- 
time affiliate of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe 
of Texas and proudly served as a councilman. 
C.B. Celestine was born on May 5, 1935, to 
Gus and Flanche Boatman Celestine in Living-
ston, Texas. As a young adult, he admirably 
joined the U.S. Army and fought bravely in the 
Vietnam War. Following his military service, 
C.B. worked for Triple S Construction in 
Texas, and after many years of service, retired 
as a Boilermaker Supervisor from the com-
pany. He spent much of his life in Livingston 
but had lived in Kountze, Texas, for the past 
nine years, married to his lovely wife Hazel 
and father to his four children. 
Mr. Celestine was a proud member of the 
Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, a native 
speaker, and was known for his extensive tra-
ditional knowledge of the Tribe. C.B. was also 
the eldest member of the Beaver Clan. While 
growing up in the Tribe, he was in a singing 
quintet with a few of his tribal brothers called 
the Woody Woodrome quintet, and they pro-
duced an album together titled the Excitement 
of the Gospel. He spent much time of his adult 
life singing, playing gospel music, and cele-
brating the life of Christ with his family and 
friends. 
C.B. reflected God’s love daily in his service 
to his Tribe and others and leaves behind 
quite a legacy. A committed Christian, he 
spent much of his life as an active member of 
Indian Baptist Church in Polk County, Texas. 
In his spare time, he also enjoyed working on 
race cars with his son Jimmy, hunting, and 
spending time with his four wonderful grand-
children. 
He is proceeded in death by his parents, 
Gus and Flanche Celestine; son, Timmy 
Celestine; daughter, Tania Honeycutt; broth-
ers, 
Gus 
Celestine, 
Jr., 
Milton 
Warren 
Celestine, and Wesley Celestine; sisters, Flor-
ence Robinson and Claire Breaux. He is sur-
vived by his loving wife of 57 years, Hazel 
Celestine of Kountze; sons, Jimmy Celestine 
and Charles Celestine of Kountze; grand-
children, Maegan Drake, Morgan Celestine, 
Jordan Honeycutt, and Maddie Honeycutt. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the 
family of Mr. Celestine for C.B.’s faithful serv-
ice and devotion to his country, Tribe, and 
community. My thoughts and prayers remain 
with his family and friends.

The local company stepped up to the plate 
during COVID–19, transitioning the production 
of their famed baseball and pickleball products 
into developing high-quality face masks. 
As an economic shutdown approached, the 
cancellation of the spring baseball season put 
Tanners’ peak shipping season on hold. While 
many businesses shut down, Tanners got cre-
ative with a way to move forward, keep local 
jobs available and support the health and well- 
being of the communities around them. 
Owner Vince Signorelli and his staff worked 
tirelessly with their existing network to create 
a mask that would not only meet the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention’s protec-
tion recommendations, but also allow athletes 
to wear and still perform. Within just three 
weeks of planning and design, Tanners and 
their in-house clothing brand, Vulcan Sporting

This team of Fourth District citizens are he-

marvel at how the American Spirit is alive and 
well right here in Hot Springs, Arkansas.’’

RECOGNIZING THE 73RD ANNIVER-
SARY OF PAKISTAN’S INDEPEND-
ENCE 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the people of Paki-
stan and the Pakistani diaspora here in the 
United States as they celebrate the 73rd anni-
versary of their country’s independence from 
British colonial rule. 
Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the 
Pakistan movement, was sworn in as the first 
Governor General of Pakistan on August 14, 
1947. This date commemorates the day Paki-
stan won Independence from British rule and 
the founding of a Muslim state in the north-
western and eastern regions of the Indian sub-
continent. This day is celebrated in Pakistan 
and by the global Pakistani diaspora with fes-
tivals, fireworks, and other cultural events rec-
ognizing this important milestone. 
For the past 73 years, the People of Paki-
stan have strived for what we cherish here in 
the United States, a fully democratic govern-
ment of, by, and for the people. While there 
have been times of political unrest in the 
country’s history. Pakistan today has a well- 
functioning democracy that strives to help its 
people while geographically being in one of 
the most sensitive areas in the world. 
Throughout my time serving as a member in 
this chamber, I have had the privilege to meet 
many individuals within the government of 
Pakistan. Our countries share the same goal 
of peace, security and prosperity for our peo-
ple. 
North Texas has greatly benefited from the 
contributions made by the Pakistani-American 
community. These individuals and families, 
with their culture, traditions, and cuisine, have 
enriched the diversity we are fortunate to have 
in North Texas. Pakistani Americans have 
made great contributions to our society as 
doctors, 
engineers, 
scientists 
and 
entre-
preneurs with the younger members in the 
Pakistani American community striving for 
academic excellence. 
Madam Speaker, as I rise here today to cel-
ebrate Pakistan’s independence and the 
progress the country and its people have 
made over the past 73 years. It is my hope 
that the people of the United States and Paki-
stan continue to grow and foster friendships 
that will allow our two countries to move for-
ward towards greater peace, security, and 
prosperity for Americans and Pakistani’s alike.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF FRANK ZALLER 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Frank Zaller 
of Bolivar, Tennessee on the occasion of his 
one hundredth birthday. 
Frank Zaller is a member of what has rightly 
been called our Greatest Generation. He grew 
up in the midst of a Great Depression at home 
and rising tensions around the world. When he 
was twenty-one, the Japanese attacked Pearl 
Harbor and he signed up to join the United 
States Navy and sailed off into the Pacific the-
ater. 
During that campaign, Mr. Zaller served with 
the Third Marine Division as a Navy Corps-
man in the Battle of Iwo Jima, providing life-
saving medical care to the wounded in one of 
the fiercest battles of the entire war. He con-
tinued his service as a corpsman during the 
Korean War at the pivotal victory at Inchon. 
Mr. Zaller served in the Navy for twenty-nine 
years, including his service in WWII and 
Korea, and he finished out his career as the 
Administrator of the Philadelphia Naval Hos-
pital. After leaving the Navy, he worked as the 
Assistant Commissioner of Tennessee’s De-
partment of Mental Health before serving as 
the Administrator of the Western State Mental 
Health Hospital in Bolivar until his retirement 
in 1980. Frank and his wife Helen raised 
seven children together over the course of a 
loving marriage spanning nearly seven dec-
ades, and he enjoys spending time with his 
many children and grandchildren. 
The American people are forever indebted 
to those of the Greatest Generation, like Frank 
Zaller, who answered the call of duty and 
stepped up to defend freedom in its darkest 
hour. The freedom and prosperity we enjoy 
today are the result of the courage of heroes 
like Mr. Zaller. On behalf of the United States 
Congress, I wish to commend Frank Zaller for 
his lifetime of faithful service to our nation and 
to the people of Tennessee, and I congratu-
late him on the momentous occasion of his 
one-hundredth birthday.

TRIBUTE TO CORPORAL CESAR 
‘‘NOVA’’ VILLANUEVA, USMC 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 14, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to a hero and true 
American patriot, United States Marine Corps 
Corporal Cesar A. Villanueva. Throughout the 
history of our great nation, we have asked 
young men and women to step forward and 
voluntarily assume the duties, responsibilities, 
and sacrifices required of all Americans who 
join 
the 
finest 
military 
in 
history. 
Cpl. 
Villanueva took that important step and today 
I ask that the House of Representatives honor 
and remember this incredible young man who 
died in service to our country. 
Cpl. Villanueva, or Nova as his friends knew 
him, is remembered as a kind, respectable 
man who was outgoing, and had a passion for 
service. Nova’s love for his country and desire 
to serve led him to join the Marine Corps 
about four years ago. Cpl. Villanueva has re-
ceived numerous awards and accolades for 
his years of service including the National De-
fense Service Medal, the Global War on Ter-
rorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War 
on Terrorism Service Medal, the Sea Service 
Deployment Ribbon, and a Certificate of Ap-
preciation. 
On July 30, 2020, just a month after he 
married the love of his life, Sarah, Cpl. 
Villanueva boarded an amphibious assault ve-
hicle for a routine training exercise with Ma-
rines and sailors of the 15th Marine Expedi-
tionary Unit. The vehicle sank off the coast of 
San Clemente Island, resulting in the death of 
Cpl. Villanueva, seven other marines, and a 
sailor. 
As we look at the rich history of our country, 
we realize that this history is comprised of 
men and women, just like Cpl. Villanueva, who 
so bravely chose a life of military service. 
Each story is unique and humbling for those of 
us who, far from the dangers they will be 
called to face, live our lives in relative comfort 
and ease. Cpl. Villanueva’ s memory lives on 
through his father Juan, mother, Maria, his 
wife, Sarah, his two brothers, and numerous 
extended family members and friends. 
While we send our deepest sympathies to 
his family, there are no words that can ex-
press or alleviate the grief of losing a son, 
husband, and brother. Cpl. Villanueva’s family 
have given a part of themselves in the loss of 
their son and brother, and I hope they know 
that the goodness he brought to this world and 
the sacrifice he has made will always be re-
membered.

Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in

60 years of outstanding contributions to the 
Adams National Historical Park, the National 
Park Service, and the City of Quincy, Massa-
chusetts. 
Throughout her career, Marianne has em-
phasized education, inclusivity, and possibility, 
and has influenced the lives of many that have 
crossed her path. She has been a dedicated 
steward of history and preservation and has

quietly and humbly become a true leader in 
her field, while promoting and encouraging the 
success of others. 
Marianne entered the National Park Service 
in 1960 as a Clerk-Stenographer for what was 
then the Adams National Historic Site. While 
working for the Site, Marianne raised a family, 
studied at both Quincy College and Emmanuel 
College, and earned a master’s degree from 
Eastern Nazarene College. 
Marianne became the Superintendent of 
Adams National Historic Site in 1986. Under 
Marianne’s direction, the Site evolved into a 
National Historical Park, expanding its physical 
boundaries and presence in the Quincy com-
munity, acquiring a downtown visitor center, 
and incorporating a trolley system to improve 
access and enhance the visitor experience. 
During her tenure, Marianne has extended 
her leadership into the local community and 
has engaged and mentored young interns to 
foster their success in the world of public serv-
ice. Further, Marianne has been the liaison 
between the Adams family and the National 
Park Service for over 35 years. She served on 
Quincy’s Chamber of Commerce and on Quin-
cy’s Tourism Board. She built fruitful partner-
ships with Quincy Public Schools, the Quincy 
Historical Society, and many local businesses. 
As a founding member of the Quincy Partner-
ship, Marianne ensured that the National Park 
Service was engaged in efforts to expand 
community events and invest in Quincy’s his-
toric resources, ensuring that local historical 
societies and other historic house museums 
were represented in program planning. She 
has cultivated and maintained key partner-
ships with the Boston Public Library, Massa-
chusetts Historical Society, and the Abigail 
Adams Historical Society. 
For decades, Marianne has devoted herself 
to elevating the Adams National Historical 
Park. Thanks to her work, the Park is now a 
widely recognized museum where visitors can 
experience firsthand the homes, original fur-
nishings, and decorative arts that tell the sto-
ries of two United States presidents, John 
Adams and his son, John Quincy Adams from 
birth to death. 
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to 
take the floor of the House today to thank 
Marianne for her long, impactful career with 
the Adams National Historical Park and the 
National Park Service, and for her dedicated 
efforts to preserving our Nation’s history.
