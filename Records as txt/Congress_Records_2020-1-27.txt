for Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam-
ined the Journal of the last day’s pro-
ceedings and announces to the House 
her approval thereof. 
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio led the 
Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
HONORING LIANE DOUGHERTY 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to pay respect 
and honor to my great teacher, Liane 
Dougherty. 
Mrs. 
Dougherty 
passed 
away on December 5, 2019. She taught 
me in history class more than 20 years 
ago at Poly Prep, where she was a men-
tor. She is survived by her husband, 
Francis, and her children, Max and 
Sophie. 
Her 
students 
recall—myself 
in-
cluded—that, each and every day, she 
would approach the classroom with 
grace, compassion, incredible wisdom 
and intellect. I can say without a 
doubt, I would not be a Congressman 
today without Mrs. Dougherty. 
There is only one person in all of 
America being honored on the floor of 
the United States House of Representa-
tives today, and that is Liane Dough-
erty. She is deserving of that, the best 
teacher I could ever ask for. 
Madam Speaker, may she rest in 
peace. We will always honor her incred-
ible legacy. 
f 
CELEBRATING NATIONAL SCHOOL 
CHOICE WEEK 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, since 2011, National School 
Choice Week has been recognized as 
the largest annual celebration of op-
portunity and education in the world. 
In North Carolina, over 2,313 school 
choice events are scheduled for this 
week, including events in my district 
at the Quality Education Academy 
High School in Winston-Salem and at 
the DT Early Learning Center in 
Wilkesboro. 
Unfortunately, the media continues 
to conjure up misleading claims about 
school choice, and it is time we cor-
rected the record. School choice is not 
about picking winners and losers; it is 
about letting families choose the edu-
cational options that meet the unique 
needs of their children. 
A high-quality education is an indis-
pensable tool, and America’s children 
deserve nothing less than an education 
that empowers them to reach their 
greatest potential. 
f 
HONORING GLENN SMITH 
(Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
life of U.S. Navy veteran Glenn Smith, 
a Stark County World War II veteran 
who passed away last week at the age 
of 95. 
Glenn was a Navy Seabee and served 
our country from August 1943 to July 
1945. He was born in Indiana County, 
Pennsylvania, where his father was a 
coal miner for over 50 years. 
In a story familiar to many in the 
heartland, Glenn made it through the 
Great Depression by scrapping steel for 
extra money. He would grow up to be 
part of the greatest generation to ever 
live, the generation that freed the 
world from tyranny. 
Glenn was drafted into the Navy at 
age 19 and shipped out alongside 7,600 
other men to Honolulu on Christmas 
Eve 1943. Glenn would go on to serve in 
the Pacific theater and, at the end of 
the war, was flown from Saipan to 
Pearl Harbor, where he took the USS 
Constellation home. 
My office had the honor of presenting 
Glenn, in October of last year, with his 
military service medals earned during 
World War II. Glenn received the World 
War II Victory Medal and Asiatic-Pa-
cific Campaign Medal. 
Madam Speaker, today we remember 
Glenn’s life and service and thank him

for all he did to protect this great Na-
tion. 
f 
IRS FREE FILE RESOLUTION 
(Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, the 
IRS Free File program is an innovative 
public-private partnership between tax 
preparation software companies, the 
IRS, 22 States, and the District of Co-
lumbia offering free online tax prepara-
tion and e-filing services to low- and 
moderate-income taxpayers at no cost 
to the Federal Government. 
Since 2003, over 51 million American 
taxpayers have filed their taxes for free 
through Free File, collectively saving 
over $1.5 billion in tax preparation fees. 
A recent independent study of the 
Free File program highlighted the 
value of this critical public-private 
partnership and reaffirmed that the 
IRS would not be able to offer the Free 
File program without the financial 
support of the private sector. 
With over 100 million taxpayers eligi-
ble for Free File each year, I believe it 
is important to make sure more eligi-
ble taxpayers are aware of this Free 
File service, which is an outstanding 
complement to the other free tax prep-
aration services offered to low- and 
mid-income families. 
Today, I am introducing a resolution 
formally recognizing the contributions 
Free File has made to our country and 
expressing the House’s support for this 
vital program. 
I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank my cosponsor, Congressman 
BUTTERFIELD, for joining me in intro-
ducing this resolution and for his con-
tinued work as co-chair of the House 
Free File Caucus. 
f 
HONORING CORPORAL SCOTT 
MCDONELL 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Corporal Scott McDonell, an exem-
plary marine stationed in my district 
at Camp Lejeune. 
In the early hours of January 11, 2020, 
Corporal McDonell heroically pulled 
three people from a burning car in Wil-
mington, North Carolina. After he 
saved their lives, he stayed with the in-
jured passengers for several hours at 
the hospital. Even though he had never 
met them, he felt it was his duty to en-
sure their safety and well-being. 
Even 
while 
off 
duty, 
Corporal 
McDonell remained faithful to the peo-
ple he serves by running into harm’s 
way and risking his own life to not 
only save their lives, but also to pro-
vide comfort after a traumatic event. 
Corporal McDonell’s actions on that 
day embody the Marine Corps’ motto, 
Semper Fidelis, or Semper Fi, which is 
Latin for ‘‘always faithful.’’ 
It is such an honor to represent near-
ly one-third of all active-duty marines, 
who, like Corporal McDonell, are al-
ways faithful to their fellow marines, 
communities, and our Constitution. 
f 
HONORING SPECIALIST JOSEPH A. 
RAYMOND 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Spe-
cialist Joseph A. Raymond of East Ber-
lin, 
Pennsylvania, 
for 
outstanding 
achievement during the Soldier of the 
Year board for the 1st Battalion, 108th 
Field Artillery. 
Specialist 
Raymond’s 
outstanding 
skills and high level of motivation con-
tributed directly to him being selected 
as the Soldier of the Year, competing 
at the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat 
Team Soldier of the Year board. 
Specialist 
Raymond’s 
exceptional 
performance reflects great credit upon 
himself, the 1st Battalion, 108th Field 
Artillery, the 56th Stryker Brigade 
Combat Team, the Pennsylvania Army 
National Guard, and the United States 
Army. 
He is a credit to Adams County, to 
our Commonwealth, and to the entire 
United States of America. 
Madam Speaker, today I salute Spe-
cialist Joseph Raymond and congratu-
late him and his entire family. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JUDY CHU of California). Pursuant to 
clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares 
the House in recess until approxi-
mately 4:45 p.m. today. 
Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 12 min-

AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House

f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will 
postpone 
further 
proceedings 
today on motions to suspend the rules 
on which a recorded vote or the yeas 
and nays are ordered, or votes objected 
to under clause 6 of rule XX. 
The House will resume proceedings

f 
NEVER AGAIN EDUCATION ACT 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 943) to authorize the Sec-
retary of Education to award grants to 
eligible entities to carry out edu-
cational programs about the Holo-
caust, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 943 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Never Again 
Education Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States has demonstrated a 
commitment to remembrance and education 
about the Holocaust through bilateral rela-
tionships and engagement in international 
organizations such as the United Nations and 
the International Holocaust Remembrance 
Alliance; the United States works to pro-
mote Holocaust education as a means to un-
derstand the importance of democratic prin-
ciples, use and abuse of power, and to raise 
awareness about the importance of genocide 
prevention today. 
(2) The Congress has played a critical role 
in preserving the memory of the Holocaust 
and promoting awareness, including by au-
thorizing the United States Holocaust Me-
morial Museum as an independent establish-
ment of the Federal Government to ensure 
that ‘‘the study of the Holocaust become 
part of the curriculum in every school sys-
tem in the country’’, as well as by estab-
lishing a national Holocaust Remembrance 
Day in 1978. 
(3) 75 years after the conclusion of World 
War II, with the decreasing number of eye-
witnesses and growing distance of students 
and their families from this history, it is im-
portant to institutionalize education about 
the events of the Holocaust such as the Ger-
man Nazis’ racist ideology, propaganda, and 
plan to lead a state to war and, with their 
collaborators, kill millions—including the 
systematic murder of 6,000,000 Jewish people; 
as well as the persecution and murder of mil-
lions of others in the name of racial purity, 
political, 
ideological, 
and 
behavioral 
grounds, among them Roma, the disabled, 
the Slavs, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah’s 
Witnesses, and homosexuals. 
(4) As intolerance, antisemitism, and big-
otry are promoted by hate groups, Holocaust 
education provides a context in which to 
learn about the danger of what can happen 
when hate goes unchallenged and there is in-
difference in the face of the oppression of 
others; learning how and why the Holocaust 
happened is an important component of the 
education of citizens of the United States. 
(5) Today, those who deny that the Holo-
caust occurred or distort the true nature of 
the Holocaust continue to find forums, espe-
cially online; this denial and distortion dis-
honors those who were persecuted, and mur-
dered, making it even more of a national im-
perative to educate students in the United 
States so that they may explore the lessons 
that the Holocaust provides for all people, 
sensitize communities to the circumstances 
that gave rise to the Holocaust, and help 
youth be less susceptible to the falsehood of 
Holocaust denial and distortion and to the 
destructive messages of hate that arise from 
Holocaust denial and distortion. 
(6) Currently, 12 States (California, Con-
necticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Ken-
tucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Or-
egon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island) re-
quire by law that schools teach students 
about the Holocaust; more schools and 
teachers, including those in underserved 
communities, can and should deliver quality 
Holocaust education.

H541 
January 27, 2020 
(7) For more than 30 years, the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum has 
worked to build and support the field of Hol-
ocaust education, and advance the quality 
and sustainability of Holocaust education at 
the local, State, and national levels, by en-
gaging teachers and students across dis-
ciplines and grade levels. 
(8) The Federal Government, through sup-
port for educational activities of national 
museums established under Federal law, can 
assist teachers in efforts to incorporate his-
torically accurate instruction on human

term 
‘‘anti-
semitism’’ means a certain perception of 
Jews, which may be expressed as hatred to-
ward Jews. Rhetorical and physical mani-
festations of antisemitism are directed to-
ward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals or 
their property, toward Jewish community 
institutions and religious facilities. 
(2) DIRECTOR.—The term ‘‘Director’’ means 
the Director of the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum, 
(3) ELIGIBLE
PROGRAM
PARTICIPANT.—The 
term ‘‘eligible program participant’’ means— 
(A) a high school teacher, a teacher of one

high school or a school that includes one of 
the middle grades (as such terms are defined 
in section 8101 of the Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
7801)); 
(B) an educational leader or expert who is 
not employed by a local educational agency 
(as defined in section 8101 of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 
U.S.C. 7801)) or an elementary school or sec-
ondary school (as such terms are so defined) 
that is independent of any local educational 
agency; or 
(C) a prospective teacher enrolled in a pro-
gram of postsecondary education coursework 
or preservice clinical education. 
(4) HOLOCAUST.—The term ‘‘the Holocaust’’ 
means the systematic, bureaucratic, state- 
sponsored persecution and murder of 6,000,000 
Jews by the Nazi regime and its allies and 
collaborators. During the era of the Holo-
caust, German authorities also targeted 
other groups because of their perceived ‘‘ra-
cial inferiority’’, such as Roma, the disabled,

grounds, among them Communists, Social-
ists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and homosexuals. 
(5) HOLOCAUST
DENIAL
AND
DISTORTION.— 
The term ‘‘Holocaust denial and distortion’’ 
means discourse and propaganda that deny 
the historical reality and the extent of the 
extermination of the Jews by the Nazis and 
their accomplices during World War II, 
known as the Holocaust. Holocaust denial re-
fers specifically to any attempt to claim 
that the Holocaust did not take place. Holo-
caust distortion refers to efforts to excuse or 
minimize the events of the Holocaust or its 
principal elements, including collaborators 
and allies of Nazi Germany, to blame the 
Jews for causing their own genocide, or to 
portray the Holocaust as a positive histor-
ical event. 
(6) HOLOCAUST

a program that has as its specific and pri-
mary purpose to improve awareness and un-
derstanding of the Holocaust and educate in-

tance of preventing genocide, hate, and big-
otry against any group of people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H542 
January 27, 2020 
The Holocaust was the systematic 
and state-sponsored persecution and 
murder of 6 million Jews and an addi-
tional 5 million others who the Nazis 
deemed inferior. Yet, while it might 
seem hard for the older generations to 
believe, 
many 
younger 
Americans 
today do not know the basic facts 
about the Holocaust. 
A new study from the Pew Research 
Center found that half of Americans 
know that 6 million Jews were killed in 
the Holocaust. The research found that 
education and trips to Holocaust muse-
ums 
directly 
impact 
respondents’ 
knowledge. The figures highlight the 
need for greater Holocaust education in 
America. 
Today, anti-Semitism is on the rise. I 
hosted an event last week with leaders 
of the Jewish community and law en-
forcement. They talked about their se-
curity concerns, and they made a 
pledge to stand up for others by chal-
lenging bigotry in any form. 
We must speak out against hate and 
educate one another to prevent and 
stop the rise of anti-Semitism. 
Soon, younger generations will not 
be able to hear from Holocaust sur-
vivors, as we have firsthand. They will 
depend on their schools and their 
teachers to learn the facts. 
We were recently in Belgium on a 
trip led by Speaker PELOSI to com-
memorate the 75th anniversary of the 
Battle of the Bulge, where over 19,000 
Americans were killed in that battle, 
joining with the Allies to fight against 
hate and evil. 
We won, and after World War II, we 
said, ‘‘Never again.’’ But we realize 
this struggle continues, and it is very 
real today. 
On the 75th anniversary of the libera-
tion of Auschwitz, I urge my fellow 
Members to support the Never Again 
Education Act and keep the lessons of 
the Holocaust alive. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today, we honor 
International Holocaust Remembrance 
Day and commemorate the 75th anni-
versary of the liberation of the Ausch-
witz concentration camp. 
Today, an Auschwitz survivor from 
my 
district, 
Vladimir 
Munk 
from 
Plattsburgh, returned to Auschwitz 
after surviving the atrocities there. 
We remember the Holocaust, the 6 
million Jewish victims, and the many 
others who experienced the very worst 
of humanity, knowing that it is our 
duty to tell their stories and speak 
their names so that such depravity 
never again touches mankind. 
Sadly, the hate and anti-Semitism 
that fueled the horrors of the Holo-
caust has not been extinguished from 
all corners of the globe or driven out of 
every heart. 
In recent months, we have seen a 
startling rise in anti-Semitism and vi-
cious high-profile attacks on Jewish 
life across the country, tearing at the 
very fabric of our society. 
It has been little over a year since 
the massacre at the Tree of Life syna-
gogue in Pittsburgh, which was the 
deadliest attack on Jewish life in our 
Nation’s history. 
Just last month, a Beverly Hills syn-
agogue was vandalized, a machete- 
wielding assailant terrorized a Hanuk-
kah celebration in my home State of 
New York, and a gunman targeted a 
kosher grocery store in Jersey City. 
As we condemn these horrific acts, 
we must also ensure that our children 
understand the dangers of rising anti- 
Semitism and that they recognize its 
history. 
Yet, as the number of living Holo-
caust survivors and eyewitnesses con-
tinues to decline, studies show that the 
Holocaust is fading from public mem-
ory. By educating students about the 
horrors of the Holocaust, we can take 
proactive measures to reject the hate 
and bigotry that is fueling this dan-
gerous trend. 
I am proud to be leading H.R. 943, the 
Never Again Education Act, with my 
colleague from New York, CAROLYN 
MALONEY, as this legislation could not 
come at a more crucial time. 
Our bipartisan bill, which has nearly 
300 cosponsors in the House, will pro-
vide teachers throughout the country 
with the resources and training they 
need to teach our children the impor-
tant lessons of the Holocaust and the 
consequences of intolerance and hate. 
It will amplify the important work 
being done by the United States Holo-
caust Memorial Museum, leveraging a 
combination of public and private 
funds to develop and disseminate high- 
quality Holocaust education resources, 
which can then be adopted by our local 
schools and included in their cur-
riculum. 
This bill has the support of more 
than 1,800 Holocaust survivors from 38 
States, nearly every State with living 
Holocaust survivors, as well as 350 or-
ganizations from all across the coun-
try. 
Its consideration today is the result 
of passionate advocacy from its sup-
porters and the bipartisan efforts from 
the Education and Labor Committee. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly encour-
age all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on H.R. 943, the Never Again Education 
Act, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the chairman of 
the Education and Labor Committee. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 943, the Never Again Education 
Act. 
With each passing year, there are 
fewer and fewer people who can provide 
firsthand accounts of the horrors of the 
Holocaust. We have a responsibility to 
ensure that the lessons of the Holo-
caust are not forgotten. 
As Elie Wiesel once said: ‘‘Wherever 
men and women are persecuted because 
of their race, religion, or political 
views, that place must, at that mo-
ment, become the center of the uni-
verse.’’ 
This legislation creates a grant pro-
gram to fund Holocaust education pro-
grams across the country. 
As we confront a disturbing rise of 
anti-Jewish bigotry and acts of hate, 
let us invest in the minds of young peo-
ple to understand the destructive pow-
ers of intolerance and how to use that 
knowledge to embrace understanding 
and insight. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chair-
woman MALONEY, Mr. BACON, Mr. NOR-
CROSS, and Ms. STEFANIK for their lead-
ership, and I encourage my colleagues 
to support the bill. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON). 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Never Again 
Education Act. 
Madam Speaker, I recognize Con-
gresswoman MALONEY for her decades 
of leadership on this issue, as well as 
Congresswoman STEFANIK, who served 
as co-leads on this effort. 
Today, we have 300 of our Members 
cosponsoring this bill, compared to 
only 53 Members in the last Congress, 
and it took the leadership of many to 
make today a reality. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank the Ne-
braska State Education Association for 
raising awareness of this bill to their 
counterparts at the National Edu-
cation Association. We appreciate their 
efforts to secure the NEA endorsement. 
As we remember the 75th anniversary 
of the liberation of Auschwitz and 
other Nazi death camps, we must 
pledge to each other and ourselves to 
never forget the victims and the les-
sons learned. 
This cannot be a partisan issue. We 
must remember that the fight against 
anti-Semitism is an American endeav-
or and does not belong to Republicans 
or Democrats. Stamping out this evil is 
an endeavor for all humanity. If we 
allow it to become the agenda of just a 
single party or to be used as a partisan 
weapon, then we will provide the fertile 
ground for the growth of this evil. 
Anti-Semitism and all of its mani-
festations are plain evil, and the Holo-
caust illustrates the ultimate and hor-
rible endpoint of where hatred leads. 
As the firsthand witnesses of these 
crimes pass away, it becomes incum-
bent upon us to ensure that they are 
never forgotten and that their pain and 
suffering never become just a footnote 
in history. 
In addition, the eyes of future gen-
erations are upon us, and this legisla-
tion is needed now more than ever. Ac-
cording to recent studies, nearly half of 
our millennials are unaware that 6 mil-
lion Jews were murdered, and two- 
thirds of American millennials sur-
veyed were not familiar with Ausch-
witz. Another statistic shows that over

60 percent of religious hate crimes are 
anti-Semitic in nature. 
Our schools need the resources that 
this bill provides, and education is one 
of our strongest tools against anti- 
Semitism. This bill is especially impor-
tant considering the increase in anti- 
Semitic attacks both in this country 
and around the world. 
Even in my home State, we have seen 
this evil. Most recently, the South 
Street Temple in Lincoln, Nebraska, 
was the target of anti-Semitic van-
dalism, and last November, the Temple 
Israel Cemetery in Omaha was dese-
crated. The cemetery attack also hap-
pened near Veterans Day, which, unfor-
tunately, provided a dark reminder 
that the cause of defending freedom 
and combating hate never rests and 
that this is a cause that we all share 
the responsibility for, to fight. 
When liberating the camps, General 
Eisenhower brought journalists, gov-
ernment officials, and military per-
sonnel to the camps, as he believed 
‘‘the evidence should be immediately 
placed before the American and British 
publics in a fashion that would leave 
no room for cynical doubt.’’ 
Today, we continue that legacy. Our 
work today is a continuation of what 
General Eisenhower wanted. Today, we 
continue that legacy to ensure that 
this will never happen again, and we do 
this partially through education. 
We never forget so that ‘‘never 
again’’ will be the reality. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his leadership in bringing this im-
portant bipartisan legislation to the 
floor. I thank Congresswoman MALO-
NEY for her relentless advocacy in this 
regard. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to join my 
colleagues on this International Holo-
caust Remembrance Day in support of 
the Never Again Education Act, strong, 
bipartisan legislation to ensure that 
‘‘never again’’ are simply not words 
but a solemn, sacred pledge to be ful-
filled with action. 
Madam Speaker, I salute CAROLYN 
MALONEY, a longstanding leader in this 
effort to educate the next generation 
about the Holocaust. I also thank 
Chairman BOBBY SCOTT for his leader-
ship in this regard and for his coopera-
tion in bringing this to the floor. 
b 1700 
I thank all of our Members who have 
worked on this overwhelmingly bipar-
tisan effort reflecting the strong bipar-
tisan commitment of this entire Con-
gress to standing with the Jewish com-
munity and allies to ensure Holocaust 
education remains front and center in 
our schools. 
Last week, I had the great and sol-
emn honor of leading a bipartisan con-
gressional delegation to Poland and 
Israel to mark the 75th anniversary 
since the liberation of Auschwitz. I see 
two of our colleagues who were on the 
trip, Mr. DEUTCH and Mr. SCHNEIDER, 
who brought so much to that delega-
tion. Both of them serve on the board 
of the Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
At Auschwitz, we walked on grounds 
scarred by an almost unspeakable evil, 
where more than 1 million innocents 
were murdered. I was especially af-
fected because—as my colleagues have 
heard me say—of what my father said 
on the House floor on March 2, 1943. 
Madam Speaker, I am quoting from 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
On that day, my father said: ‘‘Action 
not pity can save millions now—extinc-
tion or hope for the remnants of Euro-
pean Jewry?—it is for us to give the 
answer.’’ He was pleading for Soviet 
Jews in the midst of the Holocaust. 
He said: ‘‘Daily, hourly, the greatest 
crime of all time is being committed. A 
defenseless and innocent people is 
being slaughtered in a wholesale mas-
sacre of millions. What is more tragic— 
they are dying for no reason or pur-
pose.’’ 
He went on to say: ‘‘It is a satanic 
program beyond the grasp of the decent 
human mind. Yet, it is being carried 
out. Already 2 million of the Jews in 
German-occupied Europe have been 
murdered. The evidence is in the files 
of our own State Department.’’ 
He went on to say, toward the end of 
his remarks—by the way, my father is 
Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr., a Member of 
Congress from Baltimore, Maryland, a 
strong advocate for calling to public 
attention the plight of Jews in Europe, 
as well as advocating for the State of 
Israel to be established in Palestine 
earlier on than our country had gone 
forth. 
He did say, though, that: ‘‘We will 
spare no efforts and have no rest until 
the American public will be fully in-
formed of the facts and aroused to its 
responsibilities.’’ 
He then said: ‘‘We believe in the over-
whelming power of public opinion as 
the greatest, if not the only, power in 
democracy.’’ 
He went on to say: ‘‘If people knew, 
then something would be different.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my fa-
ther’s full statement be included in the 
RECORD because this is what he said on 
the floor of the House all those many 
years ago. 
[Rep. Thomas D’Alesandro: Speech in Con-
gressional 
Record 
on 
Israel, 
Tuesday, 
March 2, 1943] 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A JEWISH ARMY 
Hon. Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr. of Maryland 
in the House of Representatives 
Mr. D’Alesandro: Mr. Speaker, on February 
8, 1943, there appeared a full-page advertise-
ment in the New York Times, placed by the 
Committee for a Jewish Army of Stateless 
and Palestinian Jews, of which I have the 
privilege of being a member. This ad calls for 
action, not pity, toward stopping the whole-
sale slaughter of the Jewish people in Eu-
rope. I am in total agreement with my fellow 
members of the committee that too much 
has been said and too little done. 
Under leave to extend my remarks in the 
Record, I include the text of the advertise-
ment so that it may become part of the per-
manent record: 
Action, not pity, can save millions now— 
extinction or hope for the remnants of Euro-
pean Jewry?—it is for us to give the answer. 
Daily, hourly, the greatest crime of all 
time is being committed. A defenseless and 
innocent people is being slaughtered in a 
wholesale massacre of millions. What is 
more tragic—they are dying for no reason or 
purpose. 
The Jewish people in Europe is not just an-
other victim in the array of other peoples 
that fell prey to Hitler’s aggression. The 
Jews have been singled out not to be con-
quered, but to be exterminated. To them Hit-
ler has promised—and is bringing—death. 
It is a satanic program beyond the grasp of 
the decent human mind. Yet it is being car-
ried out. Already 2,000,000 of the Jews in Ger-
man-occupied Europe have been murdered. 
The evidence is in the files of our own State 
Department. 
The Germans dared to undertake this proc-
ess of annihilation because they know that 
the Jews are defenseless; that the Jews are 
forgotten and deserted even by the demo-
cratic powers. 
The Germans believe that the United Na-
tions, indoctrinated by 20 years of anti-Jew-
ish propaganda are to a great extent apa-
thetic and indifferent to the sufferings of the 
Jews. They believe that for crimes com-
mitted against the Jews no retaliation on be-
half of the governments or armed forces of 
the United Nations will be carried out. They 
know that there is no instrument of power 
and force on this earth with which the Jews 
can fight back to avenge their dead and save 
the remaining millions. 
Of what avail are the statements of sym-
pathy and pity and promises of punishment 
after the war. Since the perpetrators of these 
slaughters are to be punished for the mur-
ders they have already committed then they 
can kill no more by further murder. 
Such mere statements of sympathy and 
pity are to the Germans proof that their 
judgement of democracy’s attitude toward 
the Jews is justified and in their criminal 
minds they understand them as ‘‘carte 
blanche’’ to go on with the slaughter. 
What can be done? 
What is necessary is to impress the Ger-
mans that the governments of the United 
Nations have decided to change their present 
policy of passive sympathy and pity to one of 
stern and immediate action; that they con-
sider the cessation of atrocities against the 
Jews are an immediate aim of their military 
and political operations. Under this premise 
vigorous United Nations’ intervention to 
save European Jewry would become a matter 
of course. Exactly as it would be if it were 
American or British civilians who were being 
killed in a systematic campaign by the 
Nazis, the whole of the forces of these great 
democracies would be utilized to find an im-
mediate and effective solution. 
The inauguration of such a new policy on 
behalf of the United Nations would logically 
result in enabling all those Jews who have 
managed to escape the European-German 
hell to fight back. The first dictate there-
fore, would be the immediate approval of the 
demand for a Jewish army of the stateless 
and 
Palestinian 
Jews—an 
army 
200,000 
strong. 
Suicide squads of the Jewish army would 
engage in desperate commando raids deep 
into the heart of Germany. Jewish pilots 
would bomb German cities in reprisal. 
A Jewish army would imply a call to arms 
of all stateless Jews living in North Africa so 
that they may participate in the imminent 
invasion of the European continent. 
A Jewish army would immediately give a 
decisive moral relief to the agonized Jews of

Europe. Their psychology of despair and 
helplessness would be transformed into one 
of hope for revenge and survival. A Jewish 
army 
will 
give 
a 
meaning 
to 
their 
sufferings—to their death. 
They will then realize that they cease 
being helpless victims and become partners 
in the global struggle for a better world, in 
which their survivors will live in freedom 
and equality as all other human beings. 
The Jews of Palestine and the stateless 
Jews want to fight as Jews. They want to 
prove to Hitler and to the world that the 
Jews can be more than ‘‘the persecuted peo-
ple’’—that Jews can die in other ways than 
through murder. They want the right to 
fight for the world’s freedom, under their 
own banner. 
To die, if needs be, but to die fighting. 
Of course, these are not all the practical 
proposals which the human mind is capable 
of conceiving. It is unfair to ask for a single 
solution to such a disastrous problem. What 
we must realize is that it is our duty not to 
resign ourselves to the idea that our brains 
are powerless to find any solution; not to re-
sign ourselves to the idea that the forces of 
democracy are too weak to enforce such a so-
lution. 
Remember when a few thousand British 
soldiers were put in chains by the Germans? 
How swift the retaliation? And how prac-
tical. 
The Germans chained no more British sol-
diers. 
Remember when a tiny town in Czecho-
slovakia was horribly ‘‘punished’’? How swift 
the hurricane of world indignation that an-
swered. 
There have been no more Lidices. 
Remember when small and encircled Swe-
den opposed vigorously and stubbornly the 
expulsion of Norwegian Jews. The Germans 
abandoned their plans. 
The Jews of Norway are still there. 
The American sense of justice and decency 
and American ingenuity must also find ways 
to overpower the diabolical plan to extermi-
nate the Jewish people. It must find a way 
now, before millions more perish. 
It is, therefore, our primordial demand 
that an intergovernmental commission of 
military experts be appointed with the task 
of elaborating ways and means to stop the 
wholesale slaughter of the Jews in Europe. 
This must be done now, before the greatest 
homicidal maniac extends his policy of ex-
termination to other peoples; before he dares 
introducing poison gas and bacteriological 
warfare. 
Remember that for years the Germans re-
hearsed on the Jews what they later prac-
ticed on other peoples. Therefore, we have 
decided to launch an all-out campaign to 
save European Jewry. We will spare no ef-
forts and have no rest until the American 
public will be fully informed of the facts and 
aroused to its responsibilities. 
We believe in the overwhelming power of 
public opinion as the greatest, if not the 
only, power in democracy. Governments in 
democratic countries like the United States 
and Great Britain can act only when they 
feel sure that they are backed by a powerful 
movement of public opinion. We plead with 
everyone to help and to cooperate in this sa-
cred campaign we have launched. Join in 
this fight, write to your Congressmen, con-
tribute to our work, so that this message 
may be carried to every city and hamlet in 
the United States as is being done in Great 
Britain. You are part of the collective con-
science of America; this conscience has 
never been found wanting. 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, after 
Auschwitz, our delegation then trav-
eled to Yad Vashem where we mourned 
the loss of—believe this—1.5 million 
little children, killed in this most evil 
of atrocities. 
Before 
we 
left 
Washington, 
in 
Krakow, Poland, and throughout the 
time in Israel, we were blessed to meet 
with and hear the testimony of sur-
vivors. Their message to us was this: 
‘‘Never forget.’’ 
As Elie Wiesel, one of the most im-
portant voices of conscience that has 
ever lived said: ‘‘If we forget, the dead 
will be killed a second time. If forget, 
we are guilty, we are accomplices. The 
rejection of memory . . . would doom 
us to repeat past disasters, past wars.’’ 
‘‘Remembering the Holocaust, Fight-
ing Anti-Semitism,’’ that was the 
theme of the Yad Vashem observance. 
It is the charge that we carry with us. 
We must always remember the hor-
rors of the Holocaust, particularly now 
as the forces of evil that led to the 
Shoah, are reawakening, and, there-
fore, we must not only remember the 
Holocaust, but fight anti-Semitism. 
Today, around the world, an epidemic 
of anti-Semitism and bigotry is spread-
ing with appalling hate crimes being 
perpetrated everywhere from super-
markets to synagogues. Disturbingly, 
we have seen a surge of anti-Semitic 
attacks here in America. 
230 
years 
ago, 
President 
George 
Washington, 
under 
whose 
gaze 
we 
stand today, our patriarch, wrote to 
the Jewish community that our Nation 
would ‘‘give to bigotry no sanction, to 
persecution, no assistance.’’ 
Yet, from New York, to California, to 
Pittsburgh innocents are being at-
tacked and lives are being brutally 
threatened, and too often, bigotry and 
persecution have been allowed to fes-
ter. More needs to be done. 
Last 
spring, 
the 
House 
proudly 
passed H. Res. 183, which condemns 
anti-Semitism ‘‘. . . as hateful expres-
sions of intolerance that are contradic-
tory to the values that define the peo-
ple of the United States.’’ And soon 
after, we passed legislation to secure 
Jewish places of worship, which is now 
law. 
Today, with this legislation, the 
House is taking another step to fulfill 
our pledge of: ‘‘Never again’’ thanks to 
all of our Members. 
This legislation authorizes funding 
for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Mu-
seum to support and strengthen their 
efforts to develop accurate, relevant, 
and accessible resources; to promote 
understanding about the Shoah, and 
the dangers of intolerance in our time. 
We must educate the world about the 
dangers of what can happen when hate 
goes unchallenged, and when oppres-
sion is met with indifference. 
Some of us were there the day the 
Holocaust Memorial Museum was dedi-
cated. Elie Wiesel spoke so powerfully 
that rainy day, and years later, I was 
honored to return to the museum to 
speak at Elie’s memorial service. 
Inside the Holocaust Memorial Mu-
seum in the Hall of Remembrance be-
fore the eternal flame, the words of 
Deuteronomy are inscribed in stone. It 
says: ‘‘Only guard yourself and guard 
your soul carefully, lest you forget the 
things your eyes saw, and lest these 
things depart your heart all the days of 
your life, and you shall make them 
known to your children, and your chil-
dren’s children.’’ 
With this legislation, we pledge to 
keep alive the memory of the Shoah so 
that we can fulfill the promise: ‘‘Never 
again.’’ 
I anticipate an overwhelming, unani-
mous vote in support of this bipartisan 
legislation, and I thank my colleagues 
for their leadership on both sides of the 
aisle for making that victory possible. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congresswoman STEFANIK and 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle for bringing this important legis-
lation to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on the 
75th anniversary of the liberation of 
Auschwitz in support of H.R. 943, the 
Never Again Education Act. 
I am proud to be a cosponsor of this 
bipartisan bill, to give schools and 
teachers across the United States the 
resources needed to incorporate Holo-
caust education into their classrooms 
and 
teach 
our 
children 
the 
con-
sequences of intolerance and hate. 
Sadly, we have seen a rise in anti- 
Semitism across the country, fueling 
horrific violence, including the shoot-
ing at the Tree of Life synagogue in 
Pittsburgh, and recent attacks over 
the holidays in New York. 
Last year in our home State of Ohio, 
a 20-year old was arrested before he 
could carry out a violent attack 
against the Youngstown Jewish Com-
munity Center. I stand with Ohio’s 
Jewish community against all anti-Se-
mitic threats and remain committed to 
ensuring that all Americans can prac-
tice their religion peacefully, without 
fear. 
The freedom of religion is a funda-
mental right provided to all American 
citizens 
in 
the 
Constitution. 
Any 
threat to this right is an attack on one 
of our core pillars of our democracy 
and must be confronted. But the fact of 
the matter is that responding to anti- 
Semitism is not enough. 
We must work to prevent it from 
ever taking root in the first place. 
That is why I cosponsored the Never 
Again Education Act. As the number of 
living 
Holocaust 
survivors 
decline, 
studies show that the Holocaust is fad-
ing from public memory. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Ohio an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
unfortunately, the same cannot be said 
of anti-Semitism. 
By educating our children on one of 
the cruelest times in human history, 
we can help eradicate the hatred that

fuels these terrible acts. It is more im-
portant than ever before that we reaf-
firm our commitment to defeating 
anti-Semitism in all of its forms and 
ensure the stories of Holocaust sur-
vivors live on. 
My father is one of the brave Amer-
ican soldiers who risked his life to de-
feat the scourge of Nazism during 
World War II, and I am proud to con-
tinue his fight against anti-Semitism 
here in Congress. 
I strongly encourage all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 943, the 
Never Again Education Act. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY), the lead sponsor of the bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding, and for his in-
credible leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my bi-
partisan 
legislation, 
H.R. 
943, 
the 
Never Again Education Act, which has 
over 300 cosponsors. 
On this day, 75 years ago, Auschwitz- 
Birkenau was finally liberated, but not 
before more than 1 million people were 
murdered there. We mark this day 
International Holocaust Remembrance 
Day as we witness the rise of anti-Sem-
itism, racism, and bigotry across our 
country and around the world. 
In fact, we observe this day of re-
membrance just weeks after a rise of 
violent anti-Semitic attacks in New 
York, including an attack at a rabbi’s 
home during the festival of Hanukkah. 
An Anti-Defamation League report 
recorded that over 1,800 of these acts 
happened in 2018 alone. And yet, as we 
speak out against these attacks and 
stand against hate with our Jewish 
communities, we are also called to act. 
Condemnation alone is not enough. 
We need to do all we can to create com-
munities in which these incidents don’t 
happen in the first place. 
We need to make a better future, one 
of understanding, acceptance, and mu-
tual respect. 
We must make sure our children and 
students understand the dangers of ris-
ing anti-Semitism. 
In the resolution establishing today 
as International Holocaust Remem-
brance Day, the United Nations asked 
each member Nation to ‘‘develop edu-
cational programs that will inculcate 
future generations with the lessons of 
the Holocaust in order to help prevent 
future acts of genocide.’’ 
As a former teacher, I know that our 
children are not born with hate in their 
hearts, and it is up to us to make sure 
that they never learn it. 
We need to give our teachers the re-
sources they need to teach about the 
Holocaust and the dangers of bigotry 
and hate. This is not an easy subject 
matter for our students to understand, 
and our teachers need support, lesson 
plans, guest speakers, and training. 
So along with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, I introduced H.R. 943, 
which will expand the U.S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum’s already impressive 
educational programs by requiring the 
museum to develop and disseminate ac-
curate, relevant, and accessible re-
sources to improve awareness and un-
derstanding of the Holocaust, and edu-
cate individuals on the lessons as a 
means to promote the importance of 
preventing genocide, hate, and bigotry 
against any group of people. 
By providing $10 million over 5 years 
to support key programs like having 
traveling exhibits, expanding a central-
ized website, a database, where edu-
cators can find curriculum and lessons 
plans that are appropriate for every 
age group; to develop and disseminate 
and implement principles of sound in-
struction; and to increase engagement 
with State and local education leaders. 
This was a huge effort over 20 years. 
I first introduced this bill in 1999, and 
I have been working on it in a bipar-
tisan way ever since. 
I particularly want to thank the U.S. 
Holocaust Memorial Museum, Hadas-
sah, the Jewish Federations of North 
America, 
and 
the 
Anti-Defamation 
League for all of their work that they 
have done, not only to support Holo-
caust education, but to support the 
passage of this bill. 
I 
especially 
want 
to 
thank 
my 
coleads on this bill, Representatives 
STEFANIK, BACON, and CARBAJAL for all 
of their hard work in gaining the 300 
cosponsors. 
b 1715 
As we recommit ourselves to the 
promise of ‘‘never again,’’ I am re-
minded that the lessons of the Holo-
caust do not apply just to anti-Semi-
tism but to all forms of hate and big-
otry. I can think of no better way to 
honor the memories of those murdered 
than to make sure our students know 
their stories, for if we do not learn 
from history, we are doomed to repeat 
it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote together in support of 
this legislation. I thank all of my col-
leagues who have signed on to this leg-
islation for their support, especially 
Chairman SCOTT for his leadership and 
support. I thank my own staff, particu-
larly Kelly Hennessy, and the staff of 
Chairman SCOTT. 
Ms. STEFANIK. I reserve the balance 
of my time, Madam Speaker. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding to 
me. 
On January 27, 1945, Auschwitz was 
liberated by the Allied forces. The 
camp enslaved 1.3 million people dur-
ing the Nazi regime. 
Today, on Holocaust Remembrance 
Day, we honor the 6 million Jewish vic-
tims and the millions of other innocent 
lives lost. We support the survivors 
who bore witness to this tragedy. Their 
scars endure. We refuse to forget the 
hate that led to this unspeakable trag-
edy. 
As new generations of Americans 
come of age, the lack of knowledge and 
understanding surrounding one of the 
greatest 
crimes 
in 
human 
history 
deepens. Across the world, we are wit-
nessing a resurgence of anti-Semitism. 
We hear dangerous and destructive 
lies that deny the Jewish experience. 
We see more hatred in our discourse 
and more violence in our communities. 
We see five people attacked while cele-
brating Hanukkah and 11 worshippers 
murdered at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life 
synagogue. 
Today, 75 years after the liberation 
of Auschwitz, we honor and remember 
the victims of the Holocaust, and we 
reaffirm our fight against this evil. 
Today, on this Holocaust Remem-
brance Day, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of H.R. 943, the Never 
Again Education Act, so that we can 
hold true to the promise of ‘‘never 
again.’’ 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH). 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, Congressman NOR-
CROSS, for yielding. I am thankful for 
Congresswoman MALONEY’s leadership 
and commitment to Holocaust edu-
cation. I appreciate Chairman SCOTT’s 
leadership in helping to bring this bill 
to the floor. 
I am thankful to all of my col-
leagues, Democratic and Republican 
alike; the Education and Labor Com-
mittee; the U.S. Holocaust Memorial 
Museum; and the Jewish community 
organizations, which all worked to-
gether to promote Holocaust edu-
cation. 
Last week, I was honored to partici-
pate in a bipartisan delegation led by 
Speaker PELOSI that visited Auschwitz- 
Birkenau. It was my first time there, 
and I walked through the gates where 
more than 1 million people perished. 
The magnitude of the effort of the 
Nazis to try to eradicate the Jewish 
people was shocking. I was shaken by 
the sight of the crematorium, the gas 
chambers, and the piles of hair, glasses, 
personal effects, and everything gath-
ered in a way to dehumanize the Jews 
before they were even slaughtered. 
It has been 75 years since Auschwitz 
was liberated, and today, there are few 
remaining survivors who can share 
their stories firsthand. Six million 
Jews were killed in the Holocaust. We 
must carry on and honor their memo-
ries as a stark and enduring warning to 
future generations, but recent polls 
show that we are failing to live up to 
that solemn responsibility. Less than 
half of Americans know how many 
Jews died in the Holocaust. Among 
teenagers, it is barely one-third. 
We must do better. Some States like 
my home State of Florida mandate 
Holocaust education as part of the pub-
lic school curriculum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H546 
January 27, 2020 
I am proud to represent Holocaust 
survivors living in south Florida. In 
my district, those survivors, their chil-
dren, their grandchildren, and all of us 
who work to elevate their stories work 
so hard to make sure that this edu-
cation is a part of every student’s edu-
cation. 
But not every State has the re-
sources, whether textbooks or sur-
vivors and their powerful testimony. 
That is why this legislation is so im-
portant. It will empower the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum to 
promote Holocaust education around 
the country. It will do the vital work 
of bringing Americans together to say 
‘‘never again.’’ 
When we visited Yad Vashem, almost 
50 countries in the world sent their 
leaders to speak up to remember the 
Holocaust and to speak out against 
anti-Semitism. 
President 
Macron 
pointed out that anti-Semitism is a 
poison. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Florida an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. DEUTCH. There are deadly at-
tacks in America and anti-Semitic vio-
lence that is almost regular in occur-
rence, but with all of this poison of 
anti-Semitism, education is our anti-
dote. 
Today, on International Holocaust 
Remembrance Day, I am proud the 
House of Representatives is working to 
give the words ‘‘never again’’ real 
meaning and real purpose by educating 
American students about the horrors of 
the Holocaust and the responsibility 
that all of us have to fight anti-Semi-
tism and hatred. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER). 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for his leadership 
in moving this bill forward and my col-
leagues in the House for passing this 
bill later this evening. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 943, 
the Never Again Education Act, of 
which I am proud to be a cosponsor. 
Today is International Holocaust Re-
membrance Day, marking the 75th an-
niversary of the liberation of Ausch-
witz-Birkenau, the Nazi’s largest death 
camp and genocidal machine that 
killed more than 6 million Jewish men, 
women, and children. 
It also marks the continuation of our 
ongoing responsibility to keep a prom-
ise made after the Holocaust: ‘‘never 
again,’’ never again to allow the evils 
unleashed by anti-Semitism, extre-
mism, and hatred to fester, never again 
to stand idly by in the face of genocide. 
Last week, I had the solemn honor to 
visit Auschwitz with a bipartisan con-
gressional delegation led by Speaker 
PELOSI. Standing before the gas cham-
bers and furnaces, seeing what seemed 
like infinite piles of personal belong-
ings taken from the victims, endless 
piles of hair of the people murdered at 
Auschwitz, I felt a deep responsibility 
to fulfill the promise once again. 
Yet, today, in this moment, we are 
witnessing an increase in anti-Semi-
tism around the world and specifically 
here in the United States. In 2018, a 
gunman walked into the Tree of Life 
synagogue in Pittsburgh and killed 11 
people. It was the worst anti-Semitic 
attack in our Nation’s history, but it 
was not the last. A synagogue in 
Poway, a kosher grocery in New Jer-
sey, and a Hanukkah celebration in 
Muncie—across the country are in-
creasing numbers of verbal and phys-
ical assaults, vandalism, and other acts 
of anti-Jewish hate. The numbers are 
truly horrifying. 
Here we are in this moment, 75 years 
since the horrors of the Holocaust 
came into full view, close to a time 
when there will be no survivors left to 
tell their story. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Illinois an 
additional 15 seconds. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Yet, anti-Semitism 
is just as dangerous today as it was 
then, and a key lesson of the Holocaust 
is more important than ever, that in 
the face of a dramatic rise in anti-Sem-
itism, we must not—indeed, cannot— 
remain silent. 
This act is a step toward that aim by 
empowering the Holocaust Memorial 
Museum to develop and distribute na-
tional education materials for teachers 
across the Nation. Only by standing 
strong in our fight against these 
threats in our time and on our watch 
can we live up to the sacred promise of 
‘‘never again.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time remains 
on either side, please. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 23⁄4 min-
utes remaining. The gentlewoman from 
New York has 121⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. SUOZZI). 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 943, the 
bipartisan Never Again Education Act, 
of which I am a cosponsor. 
Never again is, sadly, not assured. 
Today, as we mark the 75th anniver-
sary of the liberation of Auschwitz and 
honor the memory of 6 million Jews 
murdered in the Holocaust, it is more 
important than ever that we come to-
gether to fight anti-Semitism. 
Anti-Semitism is real, and it is grow-
ing. I have seen it in my own commu-
nity. Overall crime is down dramati-
cally, but hate crimes are rising. Anti- 
Semitic graffiti was found sprayed not 
once but twice at the Holocaust Memo-
rial and Tolerance Center in my home-
town of Glen Cove in Nassau County. 
Why is it happening? Divisive rhet-
oric is one cause. Nefarious use of so-
cial media by the haters and by our 
foreign adversaries who wish to foment 
civil unrest is another. But most im-
portant is ignorance. 
The ignorance regarding the Holo-
caust is shocking, with over 50 percent 
of Americans ignorant of the fact that 
over 6 million Jews were killed during 
the Holocaust. 
We must recognize that education is 
the best tool to fight ignorance. That 
is why the Never Again Education Act 
is so very important. 
I recently traveled to Belgium to 
commemorate the 75th anniversary of 
the Battle of the Bulge. In preparation, 
I read the book ‘‘Band of Brothers.’’ In 
the book, it described how soon after 
the Battle of the Bulge, literally miles 
away from the concentration camps 
they were about to liberate in just a 
few weeks, the soldiers were debating 
whether the Holocaust was real. Or, 
‘‘Was it just propaganda?’’ 
Think of it: literally miles away from 
the camps just weeks before liberation, 
after millions of people had already 
been killed, and they were questioning 
whether or not it was real. Imagine 
how more dangerous the ignorance is 75 
years later, how much scarier that ig-
norance is 75 years later. 
If we do not use the lessons of history 
to make enlightened moral choices, we 
risk turning a blind eye to the same 
hatred and anti-Semitism that formed 
the permissive foundation for genocide 
in the first place. Let’s teach our chil-
dren about the dreadful consequences 
of hate and intolerance. We can help 
ensure that ‘‘never again’’ is assured 
for future generations. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important, bi-
partisan legislation. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to close. 
Madam Speaker, more than 70 years 
ago, people around the world pledged to 
never again stand by in silence as an 
oppressed people were annihilated. As 
years continue to pass since the hor-
rors and atrocities of the Holocaust, it 
is clear that we must do more to honor 
the victims and carry them on in our 
memories. 
In fact, a recent survey found that 
two-thirds of millennials cannot iden-
tify what Auschwitz was or name a sin-
gle concentration camp, and over one- 
third of all Americans surveyed believe 
that fewer than 2 million Jews were 
killed during the Holocaust. 
Today, on the 75th anniversary of the 
liberation of Auschwitz, we have the 
opportunity to reaffirm our commit-
ment to remembrance, that we remem-
ber. 
H.R. 943, the Never Again Education 
Act, will give States and schools the 
resources 
to 
incorporate 
Holocaust 
education into their classrooms, ensur-
ing that all students of the next gen-
eration understand the evils and poison 
of the Holocaust. In doing so, this bill

helps honor the legacy of Holocaust 
survivor 
and 
Nobel 
laureate 
Elie 
Wiesel. 
By shining a light on the horrors of 
the Holocaust and educating our youth 
about the dangers of anti-Semitism, we 
further our commitment to Wiesel’s 
call for ‘‘never again.’’ 
I thank Mrs. MALONEY for her dec-
ades of leadership on this bill and for 
working on the improvements that we 
are voting on today, and I thank all of 
those who have worked on this impor-
tant issue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
b 1730 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Right up the road from where I live 
in New Jersey, there is a woman, Rosa-
lie Simon, a Holocaust survivor, who 
settled there right after World War II. 
She returned this past week to Ausch-
witz for the first time since she was a 
prisoner there in 1945, when she was 12 
years old. She said the following: 
I want to go back as a survivor and look 
back on what I went through. I want to go 
back as a human being, not as an inmate. 
We must honor Rosalie and many 
like her and all of the survivors and 
victims by supporting H.R. 943, the 
Never Again Education Act, to ensure 
the Holocaust is never forgotten and 
never repeated. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, I express support for H.R. 943, the 
Never Again Education Act. Today, January 
27, marks Holocaust Remembrance Day, as 
well as the 75th anniversary of the liberation 
of Auschwitz. We, as a society, have an en-
during obligation to not only educate our-
selves, but also future generations, on the 
atrocities that took place from 1933 to 1945 so 
that they are never repeated again. As Nobel 
Peace Prize winner, and Holocaust survivor, 
Elie Wiesel stated, ‘‘For the survivor who 
chooses to testify, it is clear: his duty is to 
bear witness for the dead and for the living. 
He has no right to deprive future generations 
of a past that belongs to our collective mem-
ory. To forget would be not only dangerous 
but offensive.’’ 
Since its opening in 1993, the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum has served as a 
reminder for the American public, as well as 
all other visitors to Washington, DC, on the 
horrors suffered during the Holocaust, in which 
Adolf Hitler systematically persecuted and 
murdered six million Jews. H.R. 943, intro-
duced by my good friends Reps. CAROLYN 
MALONEY and ELISE STEFANIK, would reinforce 
the work the Holocaust Memorial Museum 
performs by providing school systems around 
the country access to resources to incorporate 
Holocaust educational materials into their cur-
riculums. This legislation will help ensure our 
nation’s next generation never forgets the hor-
rible actions the Nazis committed, and is bet-
ter prepared to fight efforts like this in the fu-
ture. 
Unfortunately, almost 75 years after the end 
of World War II, anti-Semitism still exists 
today, with cases of violence and harassment 
frequently in the news. It is my hope that the 
Never Again Education Act will help stem the 
tide of this cowardice and bigotry. 
Once again, I applaud the House of Rep-
resentatives for taking up this vital piece of 
legislation, and look forward to working with 
my colleagues to promote religious tolerance 
in the U.S. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
NORCROSS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 943, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-

MERCHANT MARINERS OF WORLD 
WAR II CONGRESSIONAL GOLD 
MEDAL ACT OF 2020 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I move to suspend the rules and pass 
the bill (H.R. 5671) to award a Congres-
sional Gold Medal, collectively, to the 
United States Merchant Mariners of 
World War II, in recognition of their 
dedicated and vital service during 
World War II. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5671 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Merchant 
Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold 
Medal Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) 2020 marked the 75th anniversary of Al-
lied victory in World War II. 
(2) The United States Merchant Marine (in 
this section referred to as the ‘‘Merchant 
Marine’’) was integral in providing the link 
between domestic production and the fight-
ing forces overseas, providing combat equip-
ment, fuel, food, commodities, and raw ma-
terials to troops stationed abroad. 
(3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowl-
edged the indispensability of the Merchant 
Marine to the victory in a 1945 letter stating 
that, without the support of the Merchant 
Marine, ‘‘the Navy could not have accom-
plished its mission’’. 
(4) President, and former Supreme Com-
mander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, 
Dwight D. Eisenhower acknowledged that 
‘‘through the prompt delivery of supplies and 
equipment to our armed forces overseas, and 
of cargoes representing economic and mili-
tary aid to friendly nations, the American 
Merchant Marine has effectively helped to 
strengthen the forces of freedom throughout 
the world’’. 
(5) Military missions and war planning 
were contingent upon the availability of re-
sources and the Merchant Marine played a 
vital role in this regard, ensuring the effi-
cient and reliable transoceanic transport of 
military equipment and both military and 
civilian personnel. 
(6) The Merchant Marine provided for the 
successful transport of resources and per-
sonnel despite consistent and ongoing expo-
sure to enemy combatants from both the air 
and the sea, including from enemy bomber 
squadrons, submarines, and naval mines. 
(7) The efforts of the Merchant Marine 
were not without sacrifices as the Merchant 
Marine likely bore a higher per-capita cas-
ualty rate than any of the military branches 
during the war. 
(8) The Merchant Marine proved to be an 
instrumental asset on an untold number of 
occasions, participating in every landing op-
eration by the United States Marine Corps, 
from Guadalcanal to Okinawa. 
(9) The Merchant Marine provided the bulk 
tonnage of material necessary for the inva-
sion of Normandy, an invasion which, ac-
cording to a 1944 New York Times article, 
‘‘would not have been possible without the 
Merchant Marine’’. 
(10) In assessing the performance of the 
Merchant Marine, General Eisenhower stat-
ed, ‘‘every man in this Allied command is 
quick to express his admiration for the loy-
alty, courage, and fortitude of the officers 
and men of the Merchant Marine. We count 
upon their efficiency and their utter devo-
tion to duty as we do our own; they have 
never failed us’’. 
(11) During a September 1944 speech, Presi-
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt stated that the 
Merchant Marine had ‘‘delivered the goods 
when and where needed in every theater of 
operations and across every ocean in the big-
gest, the most difficult, and dangerous trans-
portation job ever undertaken. As time goes 
on, there will be greater public under-
standing of our merchant fleet’s record dur-
ing this war’’. 
(12) The feats and accomplishments of the 
Merchant Marine are deserving of broader 
public recognition. 
(13) The United States will be forever 
grateful and indebted to these merchant 
mariners for their effective, reliable, and 
courageous transport of goods and resources 
in enemy territory throughout theaters of 
every variety in World War II. 
(14) The goods and resources transported 
by the Merchant Marine saved thousands of 
lives and enabled the Allied Powers to claim 
victory in World War II. 
(15) The Congressional Gold Medal would 
be an appropriate way to shed further light 
on the service of the merchant mariners in 
World War II and the instrumental role they 
played in winning that war. 
(16) Many students of the Merchant Marine 
Academy lost their lives as they sailed 
through enemy-controlled waters or un-
loaded cargo in overseas combat areas, and, 
as a result, the United States Merchant Ma-
rine Academy is the only institution among 
the 5 Federal academies to be authorized to 
carry a battle standard as part of its color 
guard. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make 
appropriate arrangements for the award, on 
behalf of Congress, of a single gold medal of 
appropriate design to the United States mer-
chant mariners of World War II, in recogni-
tion of their dedicated and vital service dur-
ing World War II. 
(b) DESIGN
AND STRIKING.—For the pur-
poses of the award described in subsection 
(a), the Secretary of the Treasury (in this 
Act referred to as the ‘‘Secretary’’) shall 
strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, 
devices, and inscriptions, to be determined 
by the Secretary.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 5671, 
the Merchant Mariners of World War II 
Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2020. 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GARAMENDI) for his 
work on this bill, which honors the 
courage and sacrifice of the civilian 
mariners of the Merchant Marine. 
In the early days of America’s in-
volvement in World War II, German U- 
boats sank numerous vessels during 
the Battle of the Atlantic. While many 
think of convoys being attacked as 
being close to Europe, the German 
Navy also took the war to the U.S. 
Eastern seaboard. In March 1942 alone, 
27 ships from six Allied nations were 
sunk off U.S. shores. All told, 733 
American cargo ships were lost during 
World War II. 
Despite this danger, some 215,000 ci-
vilian merchant marines served with 
courage to establish and maintain crit-
ical supply lines, ensuring that vital 
supplies, cargo, and personnel reached 
Allied forces in both Europe and Asia. 
Though they had no military standing 
or government benefits, these civilian 
mariners often faced German U-boat 
assaults. 
These brave mariners paid a heavy 
price in service to their country, suf-
fering the highest casualty rate of any 
branch of U.S. Armed Forces during 
World War II. An estimated 9,300 mari-
ners lost their lives, and another 12,000 
were wounded to make sure our uni-
formed 
servicemembers 
could 
keep 
fighting. 
Unfortunately, their sacrifices are 
commonly underappreciated and often 
overlooked. They were not even consid-
ered veterans until Congress remedied 
that disservice in 1988, and many of our 
histories of World War II give them a 
passing mention or do not recognize 
their vital role in ensuring the success 
of the Allied forces. 
Now, on the 75th anniversary of the 
Allied victory in World War II, let us 
give these brave mariners the recogni-
tion they so richly deserve. 
I thank Mr. GARAMENDI for intro-
ducing this bill this Congress, and I 
urge Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 5671, the Mer-
chant Mariners of World War II Con-
gressional Gold Medal Act of 2020. 
Madam Speaker, it is fair to say 
that, when we look back on the many 
victories of World War II, unfortu-
nately, too often, our Merchant Ma-
rine, our merchant mariners are over-
looked. It is this exact reason why this 
Congress has come together to pass 
this bill to honor these brave sailors 
and their legacy. 
During wartime, merchant mariners 
became an auxiliary to the Navy; and, 
as such, civilian volunteers traded 
intercoastal bulk cargo routes for dan-
gerous near-coastal and transatlantic 
shipping, hauling vital war cargo for 
our Allies. 
It is in this exact scenario that 
250,000 merchant mariners found them-
selves when World War II broke out. 
Many of these brave men perished at 
sea. In fact, Madam Speaker, 1 in 26 
never made it home. 
Madam Speaker, the merchant mari-
ners who survived World War II were fi-
nally awarded veteran status in 1988. 
And if you walk down The Mall here in 
the Nation’s Capital, you will find the 
World War II Memorial, and you will 
find the seal of the merchant mari-
ners—which 
reads, 
‘‘In 
Peace 
and 
War’’—honoring 
those 
lost 
during 
World War II. 
The importance of the merchant 
mariners was not lost on our former 
Chief 
Executives. 
President 
Eisen-
hower, when he was the General of the 
Army, stated: 
When final victory is ours, there is no or-
ganization that shared its credit more de-
servedly than the Merchant Marine. 
President Franklin Roosevelt simi-
larly stated: 
The men of our American Merchant Marine 
have pushed through despite the perils of the 
submarine, the dive bomber, the surface 
raider. They have returned voluntarily to 
their jobs at sea again and again, because 
they know, they realized their lifeline to the 
battlefront would be broken if they did not 
carry out their mission, that vital, vital part 
of the global war. 
Indeed, America as ally, as arsenal of 
democracy, as manufacturer of the 
critical war material necessary to win 
in Europe and win across the Atlantic 
would be lost were it not for the mer-
chant mariners. 
These men deserve the recognition of 
this gold medal. Of the 250,000 World 
War II merchant mariners who were 
part of that global struggle, fewer than 
2,000 merchant mariner veterans are 
believed to still be alive today. It is 
imperative that we commemorate their 
service, their sacrifice, their leader-
ship, their integral role in the victory 
of the Atlantic and the Pacific. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. SUOZZI). 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 5671, the Mer-
chant Mariners of World War II Con-
gressional Gold Medal Act, introduced 
by Representative GARAMENDI. This act 
will award a Congressional Gold Medal, 
an extremely high honor, to the mer-
chant mariners who served our country 
during World War II. 
This legislation is particularly time-
ly, as the Board of Visitors of the 
United States Merchant Marine Acad-
emy, of which I am a member, is meet-
ing on campus next week in Kings 
Point, Long Island, in my district. 
The United States Merchant Marine 
Academy is the only service academy 
whose students engage in combat dur-
ing times of war. In fact, over 7,000 of 
these students answered our Nation’s 
call to duty. Six hundred are still alive 
today, but 142 of them did not make it 
back from World War II. 
Edwin J. O’Hara was one of those stu-
dents. In 1942, Edwin O’Hara was just 
another 19-year-old cadet and signed on 
aboard the newly delivered Liberty 
ship SS Stephen Hopkins in San Fran-
cisco, California. 
On one foggy, hazy night aboard the 
ship, a German raider appeared out of 
the mist and began firing at close 
range. Bullets rained down on the crew, 
wounding the armed guard commander 
and taking him out of action. O’Hara, 
just a student, who was nearby, rushed 
forward to take his place, firing the 
shells left until being mortally wound-
ed by enemy fire. 
Only 19 of the 60 men aboard O’Hara’s 
ship made it to the lifeboat that night. 
O’Hara was not one of them. For his 
brave sacrifice, Edwin O’Hara was post-
humously awarded the Distinguished 
Service Medal. 
Brave men and women like O’Hara at 
the Merchant Marine Academy in

Kings Point, as well as the mariners 
who served across the country, deserve 
the highest recognition. 
Sadly, many of these midshipmen did 
not even receive veteran status until 
1988. But it is not too late. It is time we 
recognized their sacrifice and award 
them 
this 
much-deserved 
Congres-
sional Gold Medal. 
I applaud my colleagues, all of them, 
for supporting this and Congressman 
JOHN
GARAMENDI, especially, for his 
leadership, and I ask my colleagues to 
support our brave merchant mariners. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and 
let me say in closing what a pleasure it 
is to work with my friend from Guam 
on this bill to recognize our merchant 
mariners. 
I thank my friend from New York 
(Mr. SUOZZI) who has the privilege 
every day of representing the Merchant 
Marine Academy on Long Island. 
Let’s come together as a Congress 
and support this important effort to 
recognize those who gave so much to 
save the world and make the world safe 
for democracy. We couldn’t have done 
it without our merchant marines and 
their bravery across the seas. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
I am pleased that this bipartisan bill 
honors those who answered this Na-
tion’s call to duty, regardless of the 
danger and without expectation of ac-
colades. 
This bill incorporates relevant tech-
nical changes introduced by the Senate 
and includes the additional recognition 
of the students of the Merchant Marine 
Academy who lost their lives in service 
to their country. It is time that we 
give these courageous mariners the 
recognition 
they 
have 
more 
than 
earned. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in support of this 
important piece of legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Guam (Mr. SAN 
NICOLAS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5671. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ADVANCING RESEARCH TO 
PREVENT SUICIDE ACT 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4704) to direct the Director of 
the National Science Foundation to 
support multidisciplinary research on 
the science of suicide, and to advance 
the knowledge and understanding of 
issues that may be associated with sev-
eral aspects of suicide including intrin-
sic and extrinsic factors related to 
areas such as wellbeing, resilience, and 
vulnerability, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4704 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Advancing 
Research to Prevent Suicide Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The rate of Americans dying by suicide 
is on the rise, increasing 10.7 to 14.0 deaths 
per 100,000 people from 2001 to 2017. 
(2) Suicide is the tenth-leading cause of 
death among people in the United States and 
the second-leading cause of death for young 
people between the ages of 15 and 34. 
(3) The National Science Foundation funds 
research that is improving our basic under-
standing of factors with potential relevance 
to suicide, including potential relevance to 
prevention and treatment. 
(4) Despite progress in mental health re-
search, current gaps exist in scientific under-
standing and basic knowledge of human neu-
ral, genetic, cognitive, perceptual, behav-
ioral, social, and environmental factors with 
potential relevance to suicide. 
SEC. 3. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RE-
SEARCH. 
(a) The Director of the National Science 
Foundation, in consultation with the Direc-
tor of the National Institutes of Health and 
the Director of the National Institute on 
Mental Health where appropriate, shall, sub-
ject to the availability of appropriations, 
award grants on a competitive, merit-re-
viewed basis to institutions of higher edu-
cation (or consortia of such institutions) to 
support multidisciplinary, fundamental re-
search with potential relevance to suicide, 
including potential relevance to prevention 
and treatment, including but not limited 
to— 
(1) basic understanding of human social be-
havior; 
(2) the neural basis of human cognition; 
(3) basic understanding of cognitive, lin-
guistic, social, cultural and biological proc-
esses related to human development across 
the lifespan; 
(4) basic understanding of perceptual, 
motor, and cognitive processes, and their 
interaction, in typical human behavior; and 
(5) basic understanding of the relevance of 
drug and alcohol abuse. 
(b) To promote the development of early 
career researchers, in awarding funds under 
subsection (a) the National Science Founda-
tion shall encourage applications submitted 
by early career researchers, including doc-
toral students or postdoctoral researchers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. MCADAMS) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Utah.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 
4704, the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Utah? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 
4704, the Advancing Research to Pre-
vent Suicide Act, which directs the Na-
tional Science Foundation to support 
fundamental, 
multidisciplinary 
re-
search to further our understanding of 
suicide. 
In Utah and across the country, com-
munities are facing a mental health 
crisis. Public health and medical pro-
fessionals are tracking an alarming 
rise in the rate of death by suicide, a 30 
percent increase from 2000 to 2016 oc-
curring in nearly every State. 
Suicide is now the second leading 
cause of death among Americans age 15 
to 24 and the first cause of death for 
Utahns in the same age range. Behind 
the statistics are heart-wrenching sto-
ries, such as the one I heard in Utah 
last month. 
A local television news anchor coura-
geously told her family’s personal 
story. Her 44-year-old husband, who 
was a physical therapist working to-
ward a doctorate degree, died by sui-
cide. She thought their family was 
doing well, but what she did not know 
was that her husband had struggled 
with depression in secret for years. 
A week after his death, she went 
through his phone and noticed a call to 
a national suicide hotline. The call was 
placed the day before he died. He didn’t 
say anything to his wife, not that he 
was struggling or having a hard time. 
Now, she is using her platform in the 
newsroom to talk about her experience 
and break the stigma that surrounds 
mental illness. People need to under-
stand, she says, that this is not some-
thing to be ashamed of and to ensure 
that we can get help and support to 
those who find themselves in crisis. 
In developing this legislation, I re-
cently convened a panel of experts in 
Utah, including healthcare providers, 
advocates, and community leaders. One 
constituent shared with me that her 
school district has had three students 
die by suicide in this school year alone. 
The immense tragedy of this—young 
people who die far too early—has left 
an entire community grieving and re-
flecting upon how we can help those in 
need. 
This epidemic has led to much-need-
ed action in Utah to identify and to 
support those at risk and those in cri-
sis. It has also brought new attention 
to the need to understand suicide and 
to help develop interventions to sup-
port people at risk. 
How we understand human behavior, 
our social ties, and the environments 
in which we live connects us to under-
standing what puts people at risk of 
suicide and how we can support those 
in crisis, not to mention the changing 
issues that people face, particularly 
young people, from economic change 
and the constant presence of tech-
nology that reshape how we live, how 
we connect, and how we communicate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H550 
January 27, 2020 
This legislation will contribute to 
the foundational research that we need 
to give our mental health professionals 
the tools to save lives. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have 
developed the Advancing Research to 
Prevent Suicide Act with my colleague 
and my friend, Congressman ANTHONY 
GONZALEZ of Ohio, to direct research 
into these questions and issues through 
the National Science Foundation. 
The National Science Foundation is a 
cornerstone of our Nation’s scientific 
efforts and leadership. It supports fun-
damental research in many key fields 
related to our understanding of sui-
cide—social behavior, cognition, devel-
opment, genetics, and so much more. 
I extend my thanks to the teams at 
the American Foundation for Suicide 
Prevention and the American Psycho-
logical Association for their insight on 
and endorsement of this legislation. 
I also thank Chairwoman JOHNSON 
and her staff for her support and co-
sponsorship of this bill and for her 
leadership on our committee to address 
the scientific and research issues fac-
ing our Nation today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan bill 
that will advance our national efforts 
to address the suicide crisis, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4704, the Advancing Re-
search to Prevent Suicide Act. I was 
proud to join my friend, Congressman 
MCADAMS, in introducing this legisla-
tion, and I thank him for his leadership 
and his efforts to reduce suicide rates. 
H.R. 
4704 
directs 
the 
National 
Science Foundation to support multi-
disciplinary research to discover the 
root causes of the growing suicide epi-
demic across the United States. 
The Advancing Research to Prevent 
Suicide Act will work to address sui-
cide from all angles. The research au-
thorized under this bill will look at so-
cial and economic factors, the use of 
technology, and the stigma associated 
with mental health conditions. 
Madam Speaker, just this past week, 
I participated in a suicide prevention 
roundtable organized by my office to 
hear from local community leaders and 
stakeholders about the ongoing efforts 
to prevent suicide among youth and 
veterans and to stop suicide contagions 
from spreading. I left the meeting en-
couraged by the ongoing efforts in my 
community, but I also left knowing 
that there is still much to be done. 
Madam Speaker, I want to provide 
my colleagues with some raw data to 
give a full picture of the scope of the 
crisis in our country and in my home 
State of Ohio. 
The National Center for Health Sta-
tistics and the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention released data rank-
ing suicide as the 10th most common 
cause of death among Americans of all 
ages in 2017. Between 1999 and 2017, the 
suicide rate increased by 33 percent in 
the United States. 
Nationally, the veteran suicide rate 
is 11⁄2
times the rate of nonveteran 
adults, with 6,139 veterans dying from 
suicide in 2017 alone. 
Closer to my district, according to a 
report published by the Northeast Ohio 
Youth Health Survey, between August 
2017 and March 2018, the suicide rate 
among Stark County youth ages 10–19 
rose to more than 7 times the national 
rate and 11 times the 2011–2016 Stark 
County rate. Furthermore, between 
2000 and 2016, suicide rates increased by 
36 percent in the entire State of Ohio. 
Personally, three of my own college 
football teammates have taken their 
lives in the past 12 months alone. 
We all know we have a mental health 
crisis in this country, but for me and 
my constituents, the suicide problem 
has impacted far too many close to 
home, as seen by the suicide rates in 
Stark County and the State of Ohio. 
Too many times, when I have met 
with a group of constituents to discuss 
an international trade or veteran-re-
lated policy issue, often, the biggest 
problem on their mind is the growing 
suicide threat. 
In 2018, a high school near my dis-
trict suffered from what CDC called a 
suicide contagion, when six students 
killed themselves within a 6-month 
timeframe. 
I sincerely believe that if we want to 
make a dent in the issue at hand, we 
need to be more proactive in finding 
the causes of suicide clusters and sui-
cide contagions. Our children, our vet-
erans, and our neighbors cannot wait 
much longer. It is imperative that we 
dig in and put in the work to find the 
roots of this crisis. 
The more we know about the funda-
mental causes, the better equipped we 
will be as a country to tackle the prob-
lem head-on, and that is what this bill 
does. 
Madam Speaker, again, I thank Con-
gressman 
MCADAMS, 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON, and Ranking Member LUCAS 
for bringing this bill to the House floor 
today. I am encouraged by the biparti-
sanship already shown on this initia-
tive, and I look forward to working 
with my colleagues to see this bill 
signed into law. 
Suicide was the 10th leading cause of 
death in the United States in 2017 and 
the second leading cause of death 
among people ages 10–34. 
For our Nation’s veterans, it is an 
epidemic. We lose 17 veterans in Amer-
ica a day to suicide. 
This bill will support basic research 
at the National Science Foundation 
that will inform better interventions 
and improve their outcomes. 
Madam Speaker, I again thank Con-
gressman MCADAMS for his work on 
this bill. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, we 
are facing a suicide epidemic in this 
country. This legislation will bring re-
sources to address this epidemic and to 
identify solutions that help to bend the 
curve and help to prevent future death 
by suicide. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this important bipartisan legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4704, the—Ad-
vancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act. I 
want to thank Representative MCADAMS for his 
leadership in this good bipartisan bill, which I 
am proud to cosponsor. 
Tragically, suicide is a major public health 
concern in our country. According to the Cen-
ters for Disease Control, suicide is the second 
leading cause of death among young people 
between ages 10 and 34 and the fourth lead-
ing cause of death for individuals between 
ages 35 and 54. 
In 2017, suicide accounted for more than 
twice as many fatalities than homicide. 
Despite decades of research into the com-
plex and multifaceted risk factors and cir-
cumstances 
that 
contribute 
to 
suicidal 
thoughts and behavior, the rate of death by 
suicide is rising. In 2017, 18 out of every 
100,000 Americans were lost to suicide. We 
haven’t seen a suicide rate this high since 
World War II. 
We must do more to address this crisis. 
There is a clear need for additional research 
to improve our understanding of the factors 
that put a person at risk of experiencing suici-
dal thoughts and behaviors. The Advancing 
Research to Prevent Suicide Act directs the 
National Science Foundation to support much 
needed research on the science of suicide to 
inform prevention strategies and save lives. 
I want to once again thank Mr. MCADAMS for 
his leadership on this issue. I also want to 
thank Science Committee Ranking Member 
LUCAS and Representatives GONZALEZ and 
BALDERSON for their bipartisan efforts to get 
this bill to the floor today. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Utah 
(Mr. 
MCADAMS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4704, as

The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on S. 153, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Utah? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I rise today in support of S. 153, 
the Supporting Veterans in STEM Ca-
reers Act. I thank Representatives 
DUNN and LAMB and our colleagues in 
the Senate, Senators RUBIO and KLO-
BUCHAR, for their leadership on this im-
portant bipartisan bill. 
The Nation’s economic growth and 
global competitiveness are increas-
ingly reliant on a workforce that is 
equipped with STEM knowledge and 
skills. Nearly every aspect of modern 
life, from transportation, agriculture, 
and healthcare, to energy and national 
defense, is built on a foundation of 
science and technology. To maintain 
our standing as the global leader in in-
novation, we must continue to invest 
in and expand our STEM workforce. 
While these challenges have been 
well defined for some time, we con-
tinue to struggle as a Nation to 
produce 
enough 
workers 
with 
the 
STEM skills and knowledge that their 
employers need.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H552 
January 27, 2020 
Business leaders have expressed con-
cern that the STEM skills shortage 
will impact their ability to develop 
new technologies and to grow their 
companies. 
The veteran population represents an 
underutilized pool of talent for our Na-
tion’s STEM workforce. Often, the 
skills these individuals obtained during 
their military service are transferable 
directly to STEM occupations. We 
must do more to tap into this diverse, 
highly skilled, and experienced popu-
lation to not only strengthen our 
STEM workforce but also empower vet-
erans to pursue high-paying and re-
warding STEM careers. 
S. 153 directs the National Science 
Foundation to report data on veterans 
in STEM studies and careers and to de-
velop a plan to increase outreach to 
those veterans. 
The bill also creates an interagency 
committee that will examine how Fed-
eral programs and policies can be best 
leveraged to equip veterans with the 
skills they need to transition into 
STEM careers. 
S. 153 is a good step toward address-
ing our STEM skills shortage and cre-
ating opportunities for those who have 
served our country. 
Once again, I thank my colleagues in 
the House and the Senate for their 
leadership on this very important 
issue. I also thank Chair TAKANO from 
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs for 
helping us to expedite consideration of 
this bill today on the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ and to send this 
bill to the President’s desk for signa-
ture, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 153, the Supporting Veterans in 
STEM Careers Act. 
I thank Dr. NEAL DUNN and Congress-
man CONOR LAMB, who led the House 
version of this bill, for their work to 
support our Nation’s veterans. 
S. 153 will help veterans put their 
training and experience in military 
service to new and important uses and 
help America stay competitive in re-
search and innovation on a global 
scale. 
In the last decade alone, jobs requir-
ing some level of STEM expertise have 
grown by more than 30 percent, includ-
ing jobs that do not require a bach-
elor’s degree. Nearly 7 million jobs are 
unfilled in the United States due to a 
shortage of skilled workers, many in 
STEM and related fields. 
In my home State of Ohio, we have 
been focusing on boosting and expand-
ing our cyber defense capabilities to 
the Ohio Cyber Range. In order for the 
program to be more efficient and ready 
for any cyberattack, we need a cyberse-
curity workforce properly trained in 
the STEM field. 
b 1800 
S. 153 gives our veterans the oppor-
tunity to acquire new skills and better 
prepare them for jobs of the 21st cen-
tury. 
At the same time, veterans and 
transitioning 
servicemembers 
rep-
resent a valuable, skilled talent pool 
from which to help meet this critical 
need. 
S. 153 will improve outreach to vet-
erans through the National Science 
Foundation’s programs to support and 
train STEM workers. We can serve our 
veterans and help them translate their 
experience 
into 
meaningful 
STEM 
work. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JOHNSON). 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to support S. 153, 
the Supporting Veterans in STEM Ca-
reers Act. 
The future of this Nation will be 
driven by science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics. STEM ca-
reers are among the fastest growing 
and highest-paying occupations. De-
spite these trends, we are failing to 
produce enough STEM workers to sup-
port the current pace of growth and in-
novation and ensure we continue to 
lead the world in science and tech-
nology development. 
As a Nation, we are forever indebted 
to the men and women who choose to 
serve in the military and put their 
lives on the line to protect the free-
doms that we hold dear. At a min-
imum, we must ensure veterans inter-
ested in pursuing STEM careers here at 
home have the support that they need. 
Veterans are uniquely positioned to 
contribute to our STEM workforce, 
often having training in cybersecurity, 
avionics, nuclear physics, and medi-
cine. However, significant obstacles 
often 
stand 
in 
their 
way 
when 
transitioning to a civilian STEM ca-
reer. 
S. 153 establishes an interagency 
working group to identify these obsta-
cles and develop a plan for addressing 
them. The bill also directs the National 
Science Foundation to improve its out-
reach to veterans and report on vet-
erans in the STEM workforce. These 
are important steps for honoring our 
commitment to our veterans and for 
ensuring we have a competitive STEM 
workforce. 
I want to thank Representatives 
DUNN and LAMB, and our colleagues in 
the Senate, Senators RUBIO and KLO-
BUCHAR, for their leadership on this im-
portant issue. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN). 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of S. 153, the Supporting 
Veterans in STEM Careers Act, which 
is about helping to expand veterans’ 
job and education opportunities in the 
sciences. I was the proud sponsor of the 
House version of this bill. 
The bill directs the National Science 
Foundation to develop a veterans’ out-
reach plan and publish data on vet-
erans’ participation in science, tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics 
fields in its annual ‘‘Indicators’’ report. 
The bill also updates the NSF Noyce 
Teacher Scholarship program, fellow-
ship programs, and cyber grant pro-
grams to include outreach to veterans. 
I thank Senator RUBIO and Senator 
KLOBUCHAR, for their bipartisan, bi-
cameral 
support, 
and 
Congressman 
LAMB, a member of the Science Com-
mittee, and a Marine Corps veteran 
himself, for his work on this legisla-
tion. And I salute my fellow veterans 
in the Congress who have joined me in 
introducing this bill. 
This is an excellent opportunity for 
us all to come together and support a 
meritorious piece of legislation. The 
very nearly identical piece of legisla-
tion passed this body by voice vote 1 
year ago. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
the bill and send it to the President’s 
desk. 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
have no other requests for time, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I again want to thank Dr. NEAL DUNN 
and Congressman CONOR LAMB for their 
work to support our Nation’s veterans. 
This bill will improve outreach to 
veterans through the National Science 
Foundation’s programs to support and 
train STEM workers. We can serve our 
veterans and help them translate their 
experience 
into 
meaningful 
STEM 
work. 
I again urge my colleagues to support 
this bipartisan legislation and send it 
to the President’s desk. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I urge adoption of this measure, S. 
153. I commend my colleague for this 
important legislation and the impact 
that it will have on our veterans who 
have served our country and want to 
continue to serve and provide for them-
selves and serve in STEM fields. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this measure, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD the following ex-
change of correspondence between myself 
and Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman 
TAKANO. I appreciate his willingness to work 
with us to pass this bill today and send it to 
the President for signature.

Mr. GROTHMAN changed his vote 
from ‘‘nay’’ to ‘‘yea.’’ 
So (two-thirds being in the affirma-
tive) the rules were suspended and the 
bill, as amended, was passed. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to authorize the Di-
rector of the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum to support Holo-
caust education programs, and for 
other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY 
OF 
FORMER 
REPRESENTATIVE 
MIKE FITZPATRICK 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in remembrance of Congressman 
Mike Fitzpatrick who passed away 3 
weeks ago after a 12-year battle with 
cancer. 
Mike was a public servant in the best 
sense of the word, a tireless champion 
who loved his community and always 
worked to improve the lives of his 
neighbors. 
His long list of accomplishments— 
from the conservation of public land as 
a county commissioner to the creation 
of the Washington Crossing National 
Cemetery where he now rests, are 
achievements that any Representative 
would be proud to have. 
But one cannot accurately capture 
Mike’s legacy without talking about 
the kindness that motivated his 20 
years of public service. 
Years ago, a county park officer 
called Mike about a homeless man who 
was living in the park and needed a 
place to stay. The shelters in town 
were full and the park officer didn’t 
know what to do. But Mike Fitzpatrick 
did. He let the homeless man stay on 
his couch for the night until he found 
him shelter the next day. 
Not 
everybody 
here 
knows 
that 
story. But for those who know Mike, it 
comes as no surprise. Mike never 
stopped trying to help his neighbors, 
even after retiring from Congress and 
while battling a very terrible disease. 
He was focused on what the late col-
umnist Charles Krauthammer called 
‘‘the things that matter,’’ such as one’s 
family and community. 
For Mike, politics wasn’t a career, 
but public service was a never-ending 
commitment—a passion to do good 
that was rooted in values like patriot-
ism and faith and was shaped by his up-
bringing in Levittown. 
Certainly, Mike will be remembered 
for his willingness to cross party lines. 
That is fitting. He believed the meas-
ure of a person went beyond their par-
tisan label. His bipartisan spirit has 
united this body many times before, 
and it is uniting us once again today, 
even in one of the most divided times 
in recent memory. 
He did not apologize for being a Re-
publican or a conservative. But in 
truth, those were not the titles that 
mattered most to him. It was titles 
like: ‘‘father,’’ ‘‘Catholic,’’ and ‘‘broth-
er’’ that mattered. 
He was faithful and he was honest. He 
lived with integrity and honor. He 
turned the toughest moments in his 
personal life and career into examples 
of courage, grit, and grace. Most im-
portantly, he never shied away from 
asking in the words of the old prayer: 
‘‘Lord, make me an instrument of Your 
peace.’’ 
In this body, we remember people and 
their legacies by portraits, and I am 
sure there will be public memorials for 
him, but legacies of change last so 
much longer. In fact, it grows from 
generation 
to 
generation, 
like 
compounding interest or a snowball 
rolling downhill. 
Mike’s legacy is right here in Con-
gress and back home in Bucks County. 
They will be more than a tribute to one 
man. It will be an internal reminder of 
the values he stood for, the hard work, 
the faith in God, and never giving up. 
I want you to join me in expressing 
our deepest condolences to his family. 
His wife, Kathy, is here; his mother 
and father, Mary and Jim; and we all 
know his brother BRIAN, living in his 
legacy. May God bring us comfort and 
strength in this difficult time. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, Kathy, 
members of the Fitzpatrick family, and 
Members on both sides of the aisle 
from Pennsylvania who have lost a 
dear colleague with whom they served; 
he served with honor. He served with 
civility. He served as an example. 
Madam Speaker, at a time when rank 
partisanship has become sadly perva-
sive in Washington, Mike Fitzpatrick 
shone a bright light of consensus build-
ing, civility, and respect. 
He was an example that all of us 
could follow. I was sad to learn of his 
passing. My thoughts, of course—and I 
know I speak for all of us, not in a par-
tisan sense, not in a Democratic or Re-
publican sense, but in a human sense— 
are with his wife, Kathleen, their six 
children, and his entire family which 
includes 
our 
colleague, 
of 
course, 
BRIAN, his brother who succeeded him 
representing 
Pennsylvania’s 
Eighth 
Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, it speaks volumes 
that Mike had so many friends here on 
this side of the aisle in addition to his 
own side. The words that the Repub-
lican leader spoke could be spoken by 
all of us. That is because he looked 
past party labels and saw in all of us 
fellow Americans, drawn to service like 
he was, eager to do right by our con-
stituents, as he was. 
Our 
colleague 
from 
Washington 
State, Mr. DENNY HECK, shared a story 
about a bill he and Mike were working 
on together in 2013 when Republicans 
were in the majority. Mike was the 
lead sponsor. His party was in charge. 
But because the bill would have a bet-
ter chance of getting on the suspension 
calendar if it were a minority bill, he 
gave over the lead sponsorship to 
Denny, giving up the greater measure 
of credit in order to get the bill done. 
That is who he was: getting things 
done; not taking credit, but getting the 
substance realized. That was leader-
ship—responsibility and focusing on 
substance and achievement rather than 
politics and process. 
That was Mike Fitzpatrick. During 
his two periods of service in this House, 
Mike made a real difference to keeping 
children safe online, to help those af-
fected by the housing collapse, and to 
track and stop the financing of ter-
rorist groups around the world. 
He will be remembered by all who 
served with him, by his constituents, 
all of his friends, and, certainly, his 
family; remembered for the kind per-
son that he was, for the thoughtful per-
son he was, for the courteous person he 
was, and as an effective legislator, for 
his good nature and his integrity. 
I want to thank my friend, the Re-
publican leader, for leading this trib-
ute, and I want to thank all of those on 
both sides who have taken the time to 
share stories about Mike and the im-
pact he had on us, on this House, on 
Pennsylvania, on America. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair now asks 
all present to rise and observe a mo-
ment of silence.

ADVANCING RESEARCH TO 
PREVENT SUICIDE ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BARRAGA´ N). Pursuant to clause 8 of 
rule XX, the unfinished business is the 
vote on the motion to suspend the 
rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4704) to di-
rect the Director of the National 
Science Foundation to support multi-
disciplinary research on the science of 
suicide, and to advance the knowledge 
and understanding of issues that may 
be associated with several aspects of 
suicide including intrinsic and extrin-
sic factors related to areas such as 
wellbeing, resilience, and vulnerabil-
ity, as amended, on which the yeas and 
nays were ordered. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Utah 
(Mr. 
MCADAMS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, as amended. 
This is a 5-minute vote.

Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I was ab-

MERCHANT 
MARINERS

GOLD MEDAL ACT OF 2019 
Mr. RASKIN, from the Committee on 
Rules, submitted a privileged report 
(Rept. No. 116–383) on the resolution (H. 
Res. 811) providing for consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 3621) to amend the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act to remove ad-
verse information for certain defaulted 
or delinquent private education loan 
borrowers who demonstrate a history 
of loan repayment, and for other pur-
poses, and providing for consideration 
of the Senate amendment to the bill 
(H.R. 550) to award a Congressional 
Gold Medal, collectively, to the United 
States Merchant Mariners of World 
War II, in recognition of their dedi-
cated and vital service during World 
War II, which was referred to the House 
Calendar and ordered to be printed.

MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR A 
DIVERSE AMERICA ACT 
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
from 
maternal 
mortality 
rates to inaccurate drug prescriptions 
to cardiovascular procedures, it is clear 
that minority groups experience worse 
health outcomes in our healthcare sys-
tem. 
Although structural bias is a factor, 
the unconscious biases of even the 
most well-intentioned healthcare pro-
fessionals play a role as well. And we 
can’t let this continue. 
In a district as diverse as Florida’s 
26th District, we must do more to en-
sure that every person, regardless of 
their background, can get the quality 
care that they need. That is why I in-
troduced the Medical Education for a 
Diverse America Act, along with Rep-
resentative PORTER, which would pro-
vide cultural competency and language 
training to medical students and pre-
pare them to better serve minority 
populations. 
This legislation would help not only 
patients in south Florida, but all over 
the country in diverse communities.

OBSERVING INTERNATIONAL 
HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to observe 
International Holocaust Remembrance 
Day, commemorating the 75th anniver-
sary of the liberation of Auschwitz. 
The Holocaust is responsible for the 
systematic murder of more than 6 mil-
lion Jews, and it is remembered as one 
of the darkest periods of modern his-
tory. 
In the wake of this tragedy, we often 
utter the words, ‘‘never forget.’’ But, as 
time passes and memory fades, this can 
become a challenge. 
We have a responsibility, however, to 
ensure that this chapter of history does 
not slip through the cracks. Through 
storytelling, the teaching of history, 
and great organizations like the Holo-
caust Museum right here in Wash-
ington, we can do our part to ensure 
younger generations truly never forget. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to pause 
and remember the pain caused by the

to pursuing liberty and justice for all 
people across the globe. 
The horrors of genocide still pervade 
the world today. We can honor the 
memory of the Holocaust victims by 
speaking and acting out against the 
perpetrators of such evil today and for 
years to come.

HONORING DR. JONATHAN 
HOLLOWAY 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the late Dr. Jon-
athan Holloway on becoming the first 
African American president of Rutgers 
University. Rutgers is getting a leader 
with exceptional credentials. 
Currently, Dr. Holloway is the pro-
vost and chief academic officer at 
Northwestern University. He oversees 
the school’s academic priorities, an-
nual budget, and faculty appointments. 
Previously, Dr. Holloway served as 
the dean of Yale College, the under-
graduate school of Yale University. Be-
fore that, he was the Edmund S. Mor-
gan Professor of African American 
Studies, History, and American Studies 
at Yale University. 
Dr. Holloway was appointed to the 
post on January 21, after a search that 
included more than 200 candidates. He 
will start the new position on July 1. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate 
Dr. Holloway. He will be a welcome ad-
dition to an outstanding university.

COMMEMORATING THE 75TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
AUSCHWITZ 
LIB-
ERATION 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, last week, I was grateful to 
serve on a congressional delegation to 
Poland and Israel, led by Speaker 
NANCY PELOSI, with colleagues ELIOT 
ENGEL, 
Chairwoman 
NITA
LOWEY, 
Chairman TED
DEUTCH, with DEBBIE 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ and BRAD SCHNEI-
DER. 
On the occasion of the 75th anniver-
sary of the liberation of Auschwitz- 
Birkenau, we saw, firsthand, the hor-
rors of the innocent Jews at the death 
camps. 
From the ashes of German Nazism 
and despotic Soviet communism, Po-
land is now a dynamic, prosperous de-
mocracy. 
We were welcomed to Jerusalem by 
Ambassador 
David 
Friedman, 
then 
meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu. At the Fifth World Holo-
caust Forum, Israeli President Reuven 
Rivlin introduced Vice President MIKE 
PENCE, President Emmanuel Macron, 
Prince Charles, and President Vladimir 
Putin. Heads of state from over 30 
countries attended, and I and fellow co- 
chair of the Bulgarian Caucus, BRAD 
SCHNEIDER, were honored to be with 
President Rumen Radev with our alli-
ance for freedom. 
America’s associations with Poland 
and Israel have never been stronger, 
citing President Trump’s placing 5,000 
American troops in Poland to deter 
further Russian aggression and Israel 
still celebrating his moving of the U.S. 
Embassy to Jerusalem. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the

SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO’S 
COMMENTS ABOUT UKRAINE 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, over the 
weekend, Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo cast doubt over American sup-
port for our Ukrainian allies when he 
asked veteran NPR reporter Mary Lou-
ise Kelly if she thought Americans care 
about Ukraine and if she could even 
find it on a map. How insulting. 
Pompeo’s outburst came after Mary 
Louise Kelly questioned him about the 
administration’s shameful treatment 
of our Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie 
Yovanovitch. 
As co-chair of the bipartisan Con-
gressional Ukraine Caucus and rep-
resentative of a large Ukrainian Amer-
ican population, I am deeply concerned 
about what Pompeo was insinuating 
with his comments to NPR that the ad-
ministration can do whatever it pleases 
because the American public doesn’t 
care about Ukraine. I couldn’t disagree 
with him more. 
Ukraine is the scrimmage line for 
liberty in Europe. Liberty lovers across 
the world care about Ukraine because 
its people are facing down Russian ag-
gression. 
Unfortunately, Pompeo’s comments 
reflect a larger pattern of the Trump 
administration advancing pro-Russian 
causes. 
On Secretary Pompeo’s upcoming 
trip to Ukraine, I would urge him to 
support liberty in Europe. America and 
the world paid a heavy price for that.

HONORING DR. JAMES METTS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of 
Dr. James C. Metts, Jr., who passed 
away on Monday, January 20, at the 
age of 88. 
Dr. Metts had dedicated his life to 
public service, working as the Chatham 
County coroner for more than 40 years. 
He started in 1973, when the officials 
associated with Chatham County asked 
for his help in finding a replacement 
for the retiring coroner. When nobody 
signed up to run for the county coroner 
position, Dr. Metts volunteered him-
self. 
His colleagues remember him as 
someone who would always answer his 
phone, call you back, and perform his 
duties as coroner with class. 
In one of his most famous cases, Dr. 
Metts was called to court to testify 
about the body of Mr. Danny Hansford, 
which eventually became the center-
piece for the book, ‘‘Midnight in the 
Garden of Good and Evil.’’ 
As a doctor, he continued his public 
service by working hard to lower the 
rate of heart attack and stroke deaths 
by founding the Community Cardio-
vascular Council. 
Dr. Metts will be deeply missed 
throughout our community. His family 
and friends will be in my thoughts and 
prayers in this most difficult time.

HONORING IRENE G. NORMAN 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor Yeoman 3rd Class Irene G. 
Norman, an American hero who served 
in World War II. 
Irene Norman enlisted in the Navy 
WAVES on October 28, 1944. She began 
her service in Bronx, New York, where 
she learned the trade of sheet metal 
fabrication. She was then assigned to 
her permanent duty station at Naval 
Air Station Miami in Florida, where 
she was responsible for repairing dam-
aged aircraft so that they could con-
tinue to be used in the war effort. 
Yeoman 3rd Class Norman was honor-
ably discharged in 1946 after 2 years of 
service to her country. Mrs. Norman 
returned home and attended Hiwassee 
College in Madisonville, Tennessee. 
She went to work for the local news-
paper after graduation and did every-
thing, from writing articles to selling 
ads. She wrote a column for the paper 
called ‘‘Heads and Hearts’’ that she was 
very proud of. 
Additionally, Mrs. Norman married 
and raised three wonderful children 
after she completed her service. 
Mr. Speaker, our country’s heroes 
are the men and women of our Armed 
Forces, like Mrs. Norman, who served 
and sacrificed for our freedom. It is my 
honor to recognize Yeoman 3rd Class 
Irene G. Norman as the Tennessee Sec-
ond District’s January 2020 Veteran of 
the Month.

(Mr. GAETZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1

one of northwest Florida’s great public 
servants, my friend and one of my men-
tors, Mayor Randall Wise.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H557 
January 27, 2020 
Mayor Randall Wise was born in 1930 
in Niceville, Florida, and spent his en-
tire life as a dedicated servant to our 
town. He began his career in service in 
the 1950s as a member of the city coun-
cil. 
In 1971, he was appointed to the posi-
tion of mayor, and to the day of his 
death, he served as mayor. He was one 
of the longest serving public officials 
in America, and he was the longest 
serving mayor in the State of Florida. 
His leadership reverberated throughout 
many projects in our community, in-
cluding a senior center, a library, and 
more. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I recognize this re-
markable man for his selfless service 
to our community, his State, and our 
Nation. I am grateful for his lasting 
contributions to our town. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of National Human Traf-
ficking Awareness Month and the dedi-
cated volunteers who work to end mod-
ern-day slavery. 
As a parent, there is nothing scarier 
than the thought of children being re-
moved from their families and traf-
ficked. 
Oftentimes, when we think about 
human trafficking, we envision terrible 
situations across the globe, but accord-
ing to the Texas attorney general, 
there were more than 300,000 victims of 
human trafficking just in Texas. 
As we bring attention to this far-too- 
common tragedy, I thank some of the 
incredible 
organizations 
in 
Collin 
County that work tirelessly to help 
survivors. Traffick911, CASA of Collin 
County, Rescue Her, Treasured Vessels, 
New Friends New Life, and the Collin 
County Sheriff’s Office are all helping 
lead the fight against human traf-
ficking. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in 
the House of Representatives to join in 
thanking these organizations and rec-
ognizing the importance of spreading 
awareness about human trafficking 
today and every day. 
f 
REMEMBERING LIBERATION OF 
AUSCHWITZ 
(Mr. FULCHER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, 75 years 
ago today, Allied armies liberated the 
Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz. 
Unfortunately, more than 6 million of 
God’s children perished before that 
happened. This can never be forgotten. 
I agree with General Eisenhower’s 
comments at the time: Educate people 
on the atrocities committed so they 
don’t happen again. 
That is why I am proud to have co-
sponsored the Never Again Education 
Act. The bill authorizes Federal funds 
to be used to teach about the Holo-
caust. Ensuring that citizens know the 
uncensored truth of history will help 
punctuate the message that anti-Semi-
tism is abhorrent and will not be toler-
ated. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Representative 
CAROLYN
MALONEY 
from New York, who took the lead on 
initiating this bill. 
Finally, to the families of the vic-
tims so tragically lost: They will never 
be forgotten. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NASA DAY 
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize NASA Day in 
my home State of Arkansas, which was 
recently 
proclaimed 
by 
Governor 
Hutchinson to be January 27, 2020. 
In my district, Harding University, a 
member of the Arkansas Space Grant 
Consortium, has played an integral 
role in advancing aerospace priorities 
for 50 years. Between 1967 and 1979, 
Harding University’s faculty and stu-
dents supported NASA’s Skylab and 
space efforts, including the 1969 landing 
of Neil Armstrong on the Moon. They 
conducted experiments examining the 
long-term effects of space on the 
human body. 
As a part of the Arkansas Space 
Grant Consortium, a group of 17 col-
leges and universities that support 
NASA’s research activities, Harding 
continues its contribution and main-
tains strong ties to our Nation’s space 
program. 
I thank Harding University for its 
commitment to our aerospace prior-
ities, and I appreciate Governor Hutch-
inson for recognizing the importance of 
NASA in Arkansas. 
f 
47TH ANNUAL MARCH FOR LIFE 
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, last 
Friday marked the 47th Annual March 
for Life, and for the first time in his-
tory, the march was attended by a sit-
ting President. 
Since 2017, the Trump administration 
has established more conscience pro-
tections than ever before, but there is 
still more work to accomplish. 
For example, the Born-Alive Sur-
vivors Protection Act, which simply re-
quires healthcare professionals to pro-
vide medical care to babies born alive 
during an attempted abortion, has sup-
port from nearly 200 bipartisan cospon-
sors. Yet, despite numerous calls re-
questing to bring this legislation to the 
floor, my colleagues and I have been re-
jected time after time. It is a sad re-
ality that we have to ask our Demo-
cratic colleagues to help us end infan-
ticide, but it is a fight we will continue 
until innocent lives are protected. 
Fighting for life also means fighting 
for individuals who are victims of sex-
ual abuse, rape, incest, and human 
trafficking. Mr. Speaker, that is why I 
introduced legislation to codify the 
new Title X abuse reporting rules, to 
ensure these victims are protected. 
I hope to see these commonsense 
ideas signed into law and the lives of 
the unborn protected. 
f 
CONFRONTING ANTI-SEMITISM 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to confront a cancer that has 
been rapidly spreading, and that cancer 
is anti-Semitism, here at home and 
around the world. 
It is unsettling, and it is downright 
appalling. Day after day, I see new 
headlines about disparaging rhetoric 
and violence against the Jewish people. 
The Anti-Defamation League reports 
that 80 percent of European Jews feel 
anti-Semitism in their country is in-
creasing, and 40 percent live in daily 
fear of physical attack. 
In 2018, here at home, there were 1,879 
reported anti-Semitic incidents in the 
United States. Our Nation was founded 
on freedom of religion and diversity, 
and we must do everything necessary 
to preserve it. 
To that end, today, the House passed 
H.R. 943, the Never Again Education 
Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. 
It funds Holocaust education programs 
around the country. 
Mr. Speaker, America cannot and 
will not become a breeding ground for 
hatred.

RECOGNIZING EAGLE SCOUT 
DANIEL PAOLELLO 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, today, 
I 
recognize 
Daniel 
Paolello 
from 
Mullica Hills in south Jersey on his at-
tainment of an Eagle Scout rank. 
Eagle Scout is the highest rank ob-
tainable from the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica. Only a very small percentage of all 
Boy Scouts will ever make it to this 
prestigious recognition. 
Eagle Scouts continue to be more 
likely to dedicate their lives to service 
throughout their entire lives, becoming 
future leaders in military, business, or 
politics, and joining the ranks of other 
Eagle Scouts like Neil Armstrong, Ste-
ven Spielberg, and Gerald Ford, just to 
name a very few. 
I was proud to attend Daniel’s Court 
of Honor ceremony earlier this month. 
Mr. Speaker, I extend congratula-
tions to Daniel, and we look forward to 
big things from him in the future.

CONGRATULATING VIRGINIA ON 
ERA RATIFICATION 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratu-
late leaders in Virginia for their his-
toric vote to become the 38th State to 
ratify the Equal Rights Amendment 
today. 
For decades, ERA advocates across 
the country have been fighting so that 
equality for women and men is con-
stitutionally protected. The momen-
tum behind the effort has never been 
stronger. 
I have sponsored the Equal Rights 
Amendment for many years because I 
believe it is the only way to make last-
ing progress on the goals we consist-
ently fight for, like equal pay for equal 
work, ending pregnancy discrimina-
tion, and combating gender-based vio-
lence. 
The ERA is a legal foundation that 
can 
withstand 
changing 
political 
whims of legislators, judges, or occu-
pants of the White House. 
Women are long past due equal treat-
ment under the law. We will persist 
until it is firmly guaranteed. We de-
mand full equality now. We demand 
that it be spelled out in the Constitu-
tion. And you spell it E-R-A.

RECOGNIZING KAYLEE TOLLESON 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to remind America that Fort Bend 
County, 
Texas, 
is 
the 
ice-skating 
mecca of our country. 
Here is Fort Bend’s Tara Lipinski, 
the youngest woman ever to win a fig-
ure skating gold medal in Olympic his-
tory. 
I regret that I have some bad news 
for Tara. She is about to become the 
second youngest woman to win a gold 
medal in skating. 
Here 
is 
the 
soon-to-be 
youngest 
woman gold medalist. This is Kaylee 
Tolleson. She lives in Fort Bend Coun-
ty, just like Tara did. She has already 
won a gold medal—her life. 
Last year, at 9 years old, young 
Kaylee found out that she had a can-
cerous tumor the size of a softball on 
her ovary. Kaylee fought to live. With 
the love of mom and dad; the miracle 
workers at Texas Children’s Hospital; 
and her personal idol, Channel 13 
weatherman Travis Herzog, recently, 
Kaylee rang a bell. She is now cancer- 
free. 
Mr. Speaker, I invite all of America 
to watch Kaylee skate in the World 
Olympics in 2026 in Milan, Italy. May 
God bless Kaylee, and we look forward 
to watching her on TV.

COMMEMORATING INTERNATIONAL 
HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
GOLDEN). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the 
topic of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, tonight, 
over the course of the next hour on this 
House floor, Republicans and Demo-
crats united are coming together for 
the 75th anniversary of the liberation 
of Auschwitz on International Holo-
caust Remembrance Day. For all of us, 
this is an extra special, extra personal 
moment. 
b 1945 
Six million Jews, and millions of oth-
ers, died during the Holocaust; 1.1 mil-
lion people died at Auschwitz alone. 
Millions of lives were unfathomably 
cut short, tearing apart families, com-
munities, and countries. 
Thanks to the heroism of our Na-
tion’s Greatest Generation, with their 
strength, and their will, and their cour-
age, good ultimately triumphed over 
evil. 
There must be a permanent, never- 
ending, never-yielding commitment to 
never allow this form of hate and evil 
to ever rise again. This pledge must in-
clude combating anti-Semitism and 
anti-Israel hate wherever it rears its 
ugly head, and even when it disguises 
itself as legitimate. 
Today, and every day, we must reaf-
firm our pledge, ‘‘Never Again.’’ 
For everyone who is watching at 
home, after votes, while we are here, at 
times we see Republican Special Orders 
and Democrat Special Orders; but this 
is an important moment in time for us 
to come together in this Chamber, 
united, Republicans and Democrats, as 
Americans, for humanity must ensure 
that this never happens again. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

COMMEMORATING THE 75TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE LIBERATION 
OF AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. WEBER) is recognized for the re-
mainder of the hour. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today also to commemorate what 
is an anniversary we shouldn’t have 
ever had to commemorate and be here 
for, again, the 75th Anniversary of the 
liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been to the con-
centration camps. I have seen the train 
tracks where they brought in loads of 
people in railcars and they herded peo-
ple like they were cattle. I have seen 
the ovens. I have seen the gas cham-
bers. 
Mr. Speaker, I saw where Dr. Josef 
Mengele 
performed 
experiments 
on 
people as if they were lab specimens; 
many of them women. It is something 
that we should never have experienced 
and should never experience again. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we do remember 
what the gentleman from New York 
said, the six million Jews who trag-
ically lost their lives in the Holocaust. 
To keep that mind-numbing number in 
perspective, if we were to take a mo-
ment of silence for every Holocaust 
victim, I would stand up here for 111⁄2 
years. 
It is so imperative that we remember 
all of those who fought tirelessly to de-
feat the Nazi regime. With rising levels 
of 
anti-Semitic 
sentiment 
attacks 
spreading in the West today, we should 
emulate those brave men and women 
that my good friend, LEE ZELDIN talked 
about, the Greatest Generation who, in 
their spirit, they fought, and many of 
them gave all to combat and liberating 
those downtrodden by the Nazis, those 
families who were forever destroyed 
under the German Nazis; liberating 
them from anti-Semitism in all forms. 
Anti-Semitism needs to be defeated 
today. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues 
today as we recommit ourselves to the 
protection of our Jewish brothers and 
sisters and the State of Israel against 
all those who seek to destroy them, no 
matter what form. Come what may, 
BDS, anti-Semitism, all of those, may 
God protect Israel and the Jewish peo-
ple, as we proudly say; and remind our 
children—what I call the latest genera-
tion—who need to understand what the 
Greatest Generation knew, and that is 
that it can never be tolerated, never 
again. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY). 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of International Holocaust 
Remembrance Day. 
Last week, I was honored to join the 
Speaker’s congressional delegation to 
Poland and Israel, where we visited 
Auschwitz and participated in the 
Fifth World Holocaust Forum. 
We cannot fight the scourge of anti- 
Semitism without remembering the 
horrors that can occur when hate is al-
lowed to flourish. As we commemorate 
this important day, we remember those 
lost, and let the lessons from the Holo-
caust guide our work today. 
As a co-chair of the House Bipartisan 
Task Force for Combating Anti-Semi-
tism, I will continue to work with my

January 27, 2020 
colleagues from both sides of the aisle 
to identify long-term solutions to this 
age-old problem. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. MARSHALL). 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, today, 
January 27, marks International Holo-
caust Remembrance Day and the 75th 
anniversary of the liberation of Ausch-
witz-Birkenau. 
As the world pauses to remember the 
greatest tragedy in human history, we 
must recommit ourselves to opposing 
the murderous and racist ideology of 
anti-Semitism which led to the geno-
cide and death of over six million Jews 
and 11 million political prisoners at the 
hands of the Nazi regime. 
We must also remember our con-
tinuing responsibility to educate the 
world about the horrible truth of the 
Nazi atrocities and ensure the lives of 
those who were brutally murdered are 
never forgotten. 
My fellow Kansan, General Dwight 
Eisenhower, who, at the time was the 
Supreme Commander of Allied Forces 
in Europe, understood this responsi-
bility. Upon receiving news of the con-
centration camps, he quickly visited 
for himself, stating: ‘‘The things I saw 
beggar description. While I was touring 
the camp, I encountered three men who 
had been inmates and by one ruse or 
another had made their escape. I inter-
viewed them through an interpreter. 
The visual evidence and the verbal tes-
timony of starvation, cruelty, and bes-
tiality were so overpowering as to 
leave me a bit sick. In one room, where 
they were piled up 20 or 30 naked men, 
killed by starvation, George Patton 
would not even enter. He said he would 
get sick if he did so. I made the visit 
deliberately, in order to be in position 
to give firsthand evidence of these 
things if ever, in the future, there de-
velops a tendency to charge these alle-
gations merely to ‘propaganda’.’’ 
After his visit, General Eisenhower 
ordered the concentration camps to be 
visited by thousands of soldiers sta-
tioned off the front lines, as well as 
hundreds of German civilians, journal-
ists, Allied forces, and Members of Con-
gress, to ensure the truth reached the 
public. 
By the end of the war, the Nazi re-
gime had succeeded in murdering one- 
third of the Jewish people in Europe. 
Its capacity to perpetrate absolute evil 
and hatred was on a scale never before 
seen. 
Today, 
this 
hatred 
continues 
to 
manifest itself in different contexts 
and ideologies. Just in the past year, 
we have witnessed violent attacks and 
the murder of Jews at synagogues and 
other Jewish institutions. 
Increasingly, we have watched as 
Members of Congress have promoted 
anti-Semitic slurs, stereotypes, and 
tropes, spreading lies about Jews con-
trolling Congress in the media. It is the 
responsibility of every American to 
speak out against the hatred of these 
anti-Semites and educate others on the 
evil such hatred can bring. 
While the Nazi’s ‘‘Final Solution’’ is 
unlikely to ever return in the form of 
concentration camps, in the words of 
Auschwitz survivor, Primo Levi: ‘‘It 
happened. Therefore, it can happen 
again.’’ 
Every American across our great 
country would be wise to carry the 
same responsibility passed along by Ei-
senhower: To remember those who per-
ished in the hellish nightmare of the 
Holocaust, to teach others their sto-
ries, and to ensure it never happens 
again. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from New Jer-
sey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
am humbled to be here this evening to 
commemorate International Holocaust 
Remembrance Day and, this year, the 
75th anniversary of the liberation of 
Auschwitz. 
I would like to recognize all of my 
colleagues and fellow members of the 
Bipartisan Task Force for Combating 
Anti-Semitism for participating in this 
Special Order Hour; especially my 
friends, 
Congressman 
TED
DEUTCH, 
Congresswoman 
DEBBIE
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ, 
and 
Congressman 
LEE 
ZELDIN, for their excellent leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, today we remember the 
six million Jews, and millions more 
murdered in the Shoah. We must al-
ways remember the Holocaust and re-
commit to learning the lessons of the 
attempt to eliminate European Jewry. 
We all have an obligation to teach fu-
ture generations about this evil, and to 
pledge ‘‘Never Again.’’ 
This day is deeply significant to my 
family and to me. I am the grandson of 
a World War II veteran who fought the 
Nazis, and my wife’s grandparents lost 
their entire family in the Holocaust. 
It is critically important that we 
have come together to commemorate 
this solemn day, not just to remember 
the victims of the Holocaust killed by 
the Nazis in gas chambers and con-
centration camps simply for being 
Jews; but also because our history 
teaches us that we have a responsi-
bility to confront bigotry, hatred, and 
intolerance wherever it can be found. 
Therefore, we cannot, and must not, 
ignore the stunning rise in anti-Semi-
tism and Holocaust denial across Eu-
rope, around the world and, increas-
ingly, here at home in the United 
States, including the violent anti-Se-
mitic attacks we have experienced in 
New York and New Jersey in recent 
months. 
Furthermore, the mounting evidence 
that knowledge about the Holocaust is 
beginning to fade should alarm us. As 
Elie Wiesel said: ‘‘Indifference, after 
all, is more dangerous than anger or 
hatred.’’ 
According to a recent survey by Pew 
Research Center, too many Americans 
know too little about the Holocaust. 
For instance, less than half of all adult 
respondents knew that approximately 
six million Jews were killed during the 
Holocaust; and just 43 percent knew 
that Adolf Hitler became chancellor of 
Germany through a democratic polit-
ical process. 
Unfortunately, these findings echo a 
series of surveys conducted in the 
United States, Canada, Austria, and 
France in recent years, which also 
found significant gaps in knowledge 
about the Holocaust. 
We know how critical education, vis-
iting a Holocaust museum, and meet-
ing with survivors can be. That is why 
I am very proud to cosponsor H.R. 943, 
the Never Again Education Act, bipar-
tisan legislation introduced by Con-
gresswoman CAROLYN B. MALONEY and 
Congresswoman STEFANIK, to help sup-
port Holocaust education across the 
country. 
This legislation was endorsed last 
year by the bipartisan Problem Solvers 
Caucus and has been cosponsored by 
nearly 300 Members of Congress. And I 
am very pleased that the House voted 
to pass this legislation earlier this 
evening. 
I also believe it is more important 
than ever for our government to com-
memorate the Holocaust and educate 
citizens about its history. That is why 
I worked with my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives TED
DEUTCH
and BRAD 
SCHNEIDER, to ensure that our country 
properly remembers the horrors of the 
Holocaust as part of the United States’ 
commemoration of the 75th anniver-
sary of World War II. 
Additionally, I am proud to be a co-
sponsor of the TIME for Holocaust Sur-
vivors Act, which would provide better 
care to approximately 80,000 survivors 
currently living in the United States. 
Finally, I am deeply grateful for, and 
very proud to support the critical, on-
going work of the United States Holo-
caust Memorial Museum, the U.S. 
State Department’s Special Envoy for 
Holocaust Issues and for Combating 
Anti-Semitism, and the Holocaust Sur-
vivor Assistance Program. 
This past fall, a bipartisan group of 
Members of Congress visited the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum to 
tour the permanent exhibition. 
As President Clinton observed at the 
opening of the museum: ‘‘One of the 
eternal lessons to which this museum 
bears strong witness is that the strug-
gle against darkness will never end and 
the need for vigilance will never fade 
away.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle 
who have gathered here today to com-
memorate this very solemn day. Given 
the rise of anti-Semitism here at home 
and around the world, we need leaders 
willing to stand up now, and to stand 
together against anti-Semitism, and 
all forms of bigotry, hatred, and intol-
erance, which have no place in our 
country or world. 
Together, as we talk to our families, 
when I talk to my children, we should 
always remember the victims of the 
Holocaust and take care of the sur-
vivors and their descendants. 
May God continue to bless the United 
States of America, watch over them; 
and let us always remember.

January 27, 2020 
b 2000 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DIAZ-BALART). 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, today we stand in sup-
port of the international day of com-
memoration in the memory of those 
victims of the Holocaust. January 27 is 
also the day, again, 75 years ago, when 
Auschwitz was liberated, a day to re-
member the atrocities of the Holocaust 
so we may never allow such a horror to 
happen again anywhere on this planet. 
We must rededicate ourselves to ensur-
ing that we confront evil and oppose all 
forms of anti-Semitism. 
Mr. Speaker, inconceivably, some 
have the audacity to deny that the 
Holocaust happened. Others advocate 
for boycott, divestment, and sanctions 
in regard to our democratic ally, the 
State of Israel. 
We have seen shocking anti-Semitic 
attacks waged against Jewish commu-
nities all over the world and even here 
in the United States. That is why I am 
so proud to join with my colleagues 
here in the House from both sides of 
the aisle in remembering our responsi-
bility to confront indifference to evil 
whenever evil raises its head. 
Last week, I met with friends from 
the American Jewish Committee back 
home in the district, and I learned that 
25 percent of Jews are afraid to visit 
their place of worship or to proudly 
display their deeply held beliefs in pub-
lic because they are concerned or po-
tentially afraid for their safety. 
Seventy-five years ago, the world saw 
this horrific revelation of the depths of 
human depravity. That is why, today, 
on the House floor, we stand united, to-
gether. 
Despite 
our 
potential 
dif-
ferences, our religious traditions, our 
backgrounds, we stand united, to-
gether, to reiterate that anti-Semitism 
will not be tolerated, Mr. Speaker, and 
that Israel will always have the sup-
port of the United States of America. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Rhode Is-
land (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Inter-
national Holocaust Remembrance Day, 
the 75th anniversary of the liberation 
of the Auschwitz concentration camp, 
to honor the memories of the 6 million 
Jews and 5 million others murdered 
during the Holocaust and to tell the 
world that we will never forget. Today, 
we remember the lives lost during this 
incredibly dark period in human his-
tory. 
Jewish children of my generation 
grew up seeing the dark numbers 
etched into the arms of friends, neigh-
bors, and family. We heard the stories 
directly from survivors about the fami-
lies they loved and lost, the unspeak-
able brutality they endured, and the 
freedom they felt so lucky to have se-
cured here in America. 
But today’s children are the last gen-
eration who will have the opportunity 
to see and hear for themselves the sto-
ries of survivors. It is, therefore, our 
responsibility to keep their voices 
alive, to tell their stories, to be certain 
they know this history, and, most im-
portantly, to absorb the lessons of the 
Holocaust so we can prevent future 
evil, inhumanity, and brutality. 
Sadly, we know that, in the United 
States today, fewer people are learning 
about the Holocaust. A Pew Research 
survey recently found that only 38 per-
cent of American teens knew that 6 
million Jews were murdered in the Hol-
ocaust. 
At the same time that Holocaust 
education is declining, we see a signifi-
cant rise of neo-Nazi and white su-
premacist movements being fueled by 
the ability to communicate online and 
a rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the 
United States and around the world. 
If there is anything we can do to 
honor the lives of those murdered in 
the Shoah, it is to ensure that we don’t 
allow time to erase their stories, their 
memories. 
We can’t just look back. We must 
apply the lessons learned from the Hol-
ocaust, as painful as they are, to fight 
against hatred, bigotry, intolerance, 
and to remember the words of Dr. King: 
‘‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to jus-
tice everywhere.’’ 
Our burden as policymakers is to 
make certain that we are engaged in 
that fight against hatred, bigotry, and 
intolerance. I pray on this day of re-
membrance that we honor those who 
suffered and died at the hands of Nazi 
Germany by standing up to injustice 
wherever we see it. 
I thank my colleagues for their sup-
port on this somber day, and I urge 
Americans everywhere to never forget. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Tennessee 
(Mr. KUSTOFF). 
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman 
for helping organize this evening. 
Mr. Speaker, today, as we commemo-
rate International Holocaust Remem-
brance Day and the 75 years since the 
liberation of Auschwitz, it is important 
that we honor the 6 million Jewish vic-
tims of the Holocaust and the millions 
of other victims of the evil Nazi re-
gime—we honor their memory, we 
honor their bravery, and we honor 
their spirit. 
It is also important that we pay trib-
ute to the survivors who continue to 
share their stories to ensure that all of 
us, especially the younger generations, 
never forget the grave tragedy that 
took place. As Elie Wiesel said: ‘‘For 
the dead and the living, we must bear 
witness.’’ 
Sadly, the frequency and the scale of 
anti-Semitic incidents in our Nation 
and across the globe have increased, 
causing deep alarm. We must continue 
to speak up, and we must continue to 
play a role in shining a spotlight on 
the ugly resurgence of this hate. 
Today, on the annual day of com-
memoration, my colleagues and I came 
together and we passed legislation, the 
Never Again Education Act, which will 
ensure our children, tomorrow’s lead-
ers, are taught about the horrors of the 
Holocaust. 
I appreciate my colleagues for join-
ing me in being united in our mission 
to combat the rise of anti-Semitism 
around the world, as well as taking 
this time to honor the victims of the 
Holocaust. 
We must take this opportunity to re-
flect on the past in hopes of preventing 
this type of evil from reoccurring. Let 
us remember those who perished in the 
Holocaust and pray that this never 
happens again. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER). 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
WEBER) for yielding. I thank all of my 
colleagues as we join today and we re-
member, as we rise in recognition of 
International Holocaust Remembrance 
Day, memorializing the genocide of 
more than 6 million Jews, including 11⁄2 
million children. This year’s observ-
ance holds special meaning, as it is the 
75th anniversary of the liberation of 
Auschwitz. 
Auschwitz-Birkenau was the largest 
Nazi death camp, where more than 1.1 
million people—men, women, and chil-
dren—were 
brutally 
murdered. 
The 
Nazis sent many people, including po-
litical dissidents, intellectuals, Roma, 
and LGBTQ people to Auschwitz; but 
the vast majority, 90 percent of the vic-
tims, were Jewish. 
Last week, I had the solemn and pro-
found honor to visit Auschwitz with a 
bipartisan congressional delegation led 
by Speaker NANCY PELOSI. We walked 
through the gas chambers. We stood 
before the ovens built to burn up to 
1,800 bodies each day. We visited the 
barracks where people slept five to a 
rack, three racks high. We saw what 
seemed like infinite piles of suitcases, 
shoes, eyeglasses, even human hair col-
lected from the victims by their Nazi 
killers. 
Notably, in a place representing hu-
manity’s greatest crime, where people 
were denied the ability to even pray to 
their God, we joined with our Polish 
hosts to honor the memories of the 
martyrs by reciting the Kaddish, the 
Jewish mourners’ prayer. 
At Auschwitz in the days that fol-
lowed, we all asked ourselves: How 
could the Holocaust happen? Could it 
happen in today’s world? And how do 
we ensure that such evil never happens 
again? 
A key lesson of the Holocaust is that 
we cannot remain silent in the face of 
rising anti-Semitism. Right now, that 
lesson is more important than ever in 
the face of a dramatic increase in anti- 
Semitism around the world, including 
here in the United States. 
In 2018, a gunman walked into the 
Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh 
and killed 11 people. It was the worst 
anti-Semitic attack in our Nation’s

history, but it was not the last: a syna-
gogue in Poway, California; a kosher 
grocery in New Jersey; a Hanukkah 
celebration in Monsey, New York; 
across the country, a staggering in-
crease in verbal and physical assaults, 
vandalism, and other acts of Jewish 
hate. The numbers are horrifying. 
Globally, Jews are being told to not 
publicly wear a yarmulke or other out-
ward symbols of their Jewish identity. 
Throughout Europe and increasingly 
here at home, armed guards are posted 
outside synagogues, Jewish schools, 
and community centers. Entire com-
munities are living in fear. 
We cannot remain silent. All of us, 
no matter who we are, where we live, 
or how we worship, all of us must speak 
out and condemn both anti-Semitic 
words and actions whenever and wher-
ever hate raises its ugly head. 
In the House of Representatives, we 
have and will continue to take action 
to confront anti-Semitism. Last year, 
the House passed the strongest resolu-
tion in our history to clearly state we 
reject anti-Semitic stereotypes and 
considered anti-Semitic acts and state-
ments to be hateful expressions of in-
tolerance that are contrary to Amer-
ican values. We passed a bill to secure 
$90 million in funding to defend vulner-
able houses of worship. 
Congress continues to help fund the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Mu-
seum to preserve the memory, teach 
the lessons, and lead the work to stop 
future genocides. Today, this House 
passed legislation to increase our com-
mitment to teaching the next genera-
tion about the Shoah. 
Congress isn’t just focused on anti- 
Semitism here at home. In 2016 and 
2017, the House pressured the adminis-
tration to fill the long vacant position 
of Special Envoy to Monitor and Com-
bat Anti-Semitism. Finally, last year, 
President Trump appointed Elan Carr 
to this role to coordinate America’s re-
sponse to anti-Semitism around the 
world. 
As for our trip, after visiting Ausch-
witz on Tuesday, our group flew to 
Israel to join delegations from 49 dif-
ferent nations, including 41 heads of 
state, at a historic commemoration 
ceremony at Yad Vashem on Thursday. 
In the largest diplomatic gathering in 
Israel’s history, flanked by Kings, 
Prime Ministers, and Presidents, we 
spoke with one common voice to honor 
the memories of the 6 million people 
lost. We celebrated the survivors and 
the righteous gentiles who defied the 
Nazis to save thousands of lives, and 
we renewed our commitment to fight 
anti-Semitism now and forever. 
Finally, before returning home, the 
group had the chance to meet with sev-
eral Holocaust survivors and hear their 
stories. It is said that, by hearing the 
testimony of a living witness to the 
Holocaust, we are made witnesses our-
selves. As the remaining survivors age, 
soon we will be at a point where we 
will have lost the last survivor’s voice. 
We, the living, must work to preserve 
their stories for future generations. 
Only by remembering the lives lost 
and speaking out against intolerance 
in our own time can we live up to our 
sacred promise: Never again. 
We remember. We will live up to our 
promise: Never again. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Arkansas 
(Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend our bipar-
tisan group of Members on this floor 
tonight to rise on Holocaust Remem-
brance Day to pay tribute to all those 
who were affected by the enormity, the 
calamity, and the horrors of the Holo-
caust. 
Today marks the 75th anniversary of 
the liberation of the camp at Ausch-
witz on January 27, 1945. 
‘‘For ever let this place be a cry of 
despair and a warning to humanity, 
where the Nazis murdered about one 
and a half million men, women, and 
children, mainly Jews from various 
countries 
of 
Europe. 
Auschwitz- 
Birkenau 1940–1945.’’ 
Two years ago, I will never forget 
reading those words as I paid my re-
spects on a visit to this enormous Nazi 
death machine. This side of humanity’s 
greatest failure amongst millennia of 
human failure was a manufacturing fa-
cility. The Nazi’s product: murder. 
Laying a wreath at the death wall, 
kneeling in prayer before the memorial 
all failed to comfort the visitor from 
the nightmares imposed by the pile of 
shoes, a tiny sample of 43,000 pairs of 
shoes, or the fantasy of encouraged be-
longings from stacks of suitcases, or 
the physical horror of hair cut from 
the heads of those to be gassed. 
b 2015 
Mr. Speaker, millions of Jews, Roma, 
Poles, and Serbs stepped off the trains 
there at Auschwitz, only days later to 
have their souls severed from their 
earthly forms. 
Mr. Speaker, I share the concern and 
the voice of my colleagues today. I 
stand with friends on both sides of the 
Atlantic, urging rejection of anti-Sem-
itism, rejecting the rising boycott and 
divestiture movement against Israel, 
and speaking the truth. 
All of us on this House floor tonight 
are united in speaking that truth and 
voting today overwhelmingly to teach 
our children the truth of the Holo-
caust. 
Never again, Mr. Speaker. Never 
again. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
WEBER) for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, when we remember the 
Holocaust, we look backward and for-
ward. We look backward to remember 
those who perished, 6 million Jewish 
men, women, and children, every one of 
whom has a story and loved ones who 
may have survived the horrors of the 
Holocaust but were left with the sear-
ing wounds of these losses. Many other 
people—Slavs, LGBTQ people, political 
dissidents, disabled people, and oth-
ers—would lose their lives to Nazi ter-
ror before the war ended. 
At the same time, we must look for-
ward. We can’t simply pledge ‘‘never 
again’’; we must live ‘‘never again’’ day 
after day. 
Why is this so important? Kurt 
Messerschmidt, a Holocaust survivor, 
recalled encountering a crowd of people 
in the aftermath of what we now call 
Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken 
Glass, one of the most horrific anti- 
Jewish attacks in history. 
Over 2 days in November 1938, mobs 
across Germany and parts of Austria 
and Czechoslovakia destroyed syna-
gogues, 
Jewish-owned 
businesses, 
homes, schools, and cemeteries. Under 
instructions from the Gestapo, local 
authorities did nothing to stop the vio-
lence and destruction. 
The 
crowd 
Messerschmidt 
came 
across was watching an older man who 
had been ordered by Nazi soldiers to 
clean up the broken glass outside his 
own store. Messerschmidt, who helped 
the man, would later say: ‘‘I am sure 
that some of the people standing there 
disapproved of what the Nazis did, but 
their disapproval was only silence, and 
silence is what did the harm.’’ 
Today, let us remember the danger of 
silence. We must loudly and consist-
ently call out anti-Semitism in all its 
forms, whether it comes from our ad-
versaries or our friends and whether it 
is promulgated intentionally or un-
knowingly. We must strive to do so in 
a way that truly fosters understanding. 
Let us also recommit never again to 
allow people, any people, to be obliter-
ated by otherness. Let us fight the ris-
ing menace of ethnonationalism across 
the globe, and let us do everything in 
our power to protect all those who 
have been deemed ‘‘other,’’ from the 
Rohingya people of Burma to the Iraqi 
nationals in my own district facing de-
portation and grave danger. 
Only when we have done this can we 
truly say that we lived up to our prom-
ise of ‘‘never again.’’ 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. TRONE). 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Today, we remember one of the dark-
est chapters in our history, the Shoah, 
when 6 million Jews were brutally 
murdered in a genocide that left an in-
delible mark on humanity. 
This year marks 75 years since the 
liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau 
Nazi death camp. 
There alone, 1.1 million people, most-
ly Jews, were killed. Today, we remem-
ber them, and we say again: ‘‘Never 
again.’’ 
International 
Holocaust 
Remem-
brance Day serves as a reminder of 
what depravity humans are capable of

when we don’t make it a priority to 
end hate and intolerance. We must re-
member the victims now and always, 
and that includes making Holocaust 
education a priority in our schools. I 
am thankful that today my colleagues 
and I passed legislation to do just that. 
There is no place for anti-Semitism, 
racism, hate, or intolerance in 2020. I 
join with my colleagues today in say-
ing: ‘‘Never again.’’ 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for being here to-
night. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. SHALALA). 
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, today, 
on International Holocaust Remem-
brance Day, we mark the 75th anniver-
sary of the liberation of Auschwitz- 
Birkenau. 
We remember the 6 million Jews, as 
well as millions of other minority pop-
ulations, 
who 
were 
systematically 
murdered by the Nazi regime and its 
collaborators. We remember the fami-
lies who were separated and the sac-
rifices made by those who protected 
Jewish lives. 
Pure evil was committed against 
Jews, Roma, Catholics, LGBTQ individ-
uals, people with disabilities, and oth-
ers. 
We honor the 10,000 Holocaust sur-
vivors who live in south Florida and 
the nearly 70,000 more who live around 
the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to honor my 
friend, Dr. Miriam Klein Kassenoff, 
who fled Nazi Europe as a child in 1941. 
An educational specialist for Holocaust 
studies at Miami-Dade County Public 
Schools and director of the Holocaust 
Institute at the University of Miami, 
Miriam has dedicated her life to edu-
cating the new generation of teachers 
and students about the horrors of the 
Holocaust. 
Mr. Speaker, as we enter this new 
decade, we recommit ourselves to en-
suring that ‘‘never again’’ means never 
again. We will never stop fighting viru-
lent, hateful anti-Semitism and dis-
crimination wherever and whenever it 
appears. 
In this House, the people’s House, we 
stand together, united against hate. We 
stand together in pledging ‘‘never 
again.’’ 
Never again. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Florida 
for her comments, and I yield to an-
other gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we remember the 
6 million Jews and millions of others 
who were systematically murdered in 
the darkest chapter of human history. 
Last week, I had the privilege of 
traveling with a bipartisan delegation 
led by Speaker NANCY PELOSI to two 
nations forever interlaced into the fab-
ric of Jewish history: the first, a monu-
ment to tragedy; the second, a beacon 
of hope. 
In Poland at Auschwitz-Birkenau, we 
saw firsthand the painful cruelty of the 
Nazi regime. We walked the train 
tracks that transported innocent peo-
ple to captivity and the gas chambers, 
which led to their cruel and inhumane 
slaughter. 
After our time in Poland, I, like so 
many Jews escaping the horrors they 
experienced in Europe, traveled to the 
Holy Land with my colleagues. In 
Israel, we witnessed hope, the home-
land of the Jewish people. 
I continue to be inspired to see that 
such generational trauma experienced 
by our people could be harnessed into 
something as powerful as democracy. 
At Yad Vashem, Israel’s national me-
morial to Holocaust victims, we par-
ticipated in a solemn commemoration 
to those who did not live to see a 
homeland that would be theirs. We 
heard the stories of the lives lost to 
hate and of the men and women who 
managed to survive that torture. 
I represent one of the largest sur-
vivors of the Holocaust populations in 
the United States. As the last genera-
tion of survivors ends their twilight 
years, it is even more important now 
that we keep their memories alive and 
recorded for future generations. 
In the face of rising hate and anti- 
Semitism at home and abroad, we all 
have a role to play in fighting bigotry 
wherever and whenever it rears its ugly 
head. 
The legislation the House passed 
today, the Never Again Education Act, 
which provides teachers with resources 
to teach children the important lessons 
of the Holocaust and the consequences 
of bigotry and hate, is a critically im-
portant and vital step. 
As co-chair of the Latino-Jewish 
Caucus and the Congressional Caucus 
on Black-Jewish Relations and a proud 
member of the Task Force on Com-
bating Anti-Semitism, I am proud that 
we have all come together today to or-
ganize this Special Order in honor of 
International Holocaust Remembrance 
Day. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for making 
this a priority so that we could give 
voice to the notion of ‘‘never again.’’ 
Today, we remember to ensure that 
never again will the horrors of the past 
be repeated. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for being here 
for tonight’s Special Order, and I yield 
to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
DEUTCH). 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Texas for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to be 
here on International Holocaust Re-
membrance 
Day 
with 
colleagues, 
Democratic and Republican alike, who 
understand the importance of giving 
real meaning to the words ‘‘never 
again.’’ 
Standing at Auschwitz-Birkenau as 
we did with a bipartisan delegation last 
week, what you can’t help but be 
struck by is the effort, the enormous 
effort that the Nazis went to, to try to 
destroy the Jewish people, to wipe 
them from the face of the Earth. Yet, 
they failed. 
The State of Israel is strong, the 
strong homeland of the Jewish people. 
In a world that Adolf Hitler could 
never have imagined, that the Nazis 
could never have imagined, Jewish 
Members of the House, like myself, 
have the opportunity like the one now 
to remind America why this is so im-
portant. 
Like my colleague from Florida, Con-
gresswoman WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ, I 
represent a lot of survivors. Twice a 
year, our local Jewish family service 
organization has a program called Cafe 
Europa. They bring together the sur-
vivors from our community for lunch 
and the opportunity to socialize, to 
enjoy music, and to be with one an-
other. 
They sit the survivors at tables based 
on the communities in Europe that 
they came from, communities where 
the Nazis tried to eradicate all the 
Jews. Here they are now, most in their 
nineties, coming together, in this case 
in south Florida, with the opportunity 
to be with one another. 
What is so remarkable is that at vir-
tually every one of these meetings, 
there is a moment when a survivor 
from a community in Europe is able to 
reunite with another survivor from 
that community that he or she has not 
seen since before World War II. They 
have the chance to share their stories 
not just with each other, but they get 
to share their stories with all of us. 
Some, like Norman Frajman, a dear 
friend of mine who lost 126 family 
members in the Holocaust, was clear 
when he said, in speaking about Cafe 
Europa: ‘‘We are disappearing, but 
when I see faces here, it does my heart 
good. There are still witnesses to this 
tragedy, and younger generations must 
learn of these atrocities that occur 
when hatred toward one another oc-
curs. We must replace hate with love.’’ 
Norman is right. 
b 2030 
Sylvia Richter, also from south Flor-
ida, was at Cafe Europa and said this in 
describing what happened to her, she 
said: 
My sisters and I were chosen by Dr. 
Mengele. I was forced to lie about my age 
and say I was 17 instead of 14. A female Nazi 
officer wiped black soot off her arm and told 
me it was my mother, father and siblings 
that she was wiping away and if I didn’t keep 
lying, this would be me too. As she wiped 
away those ashes, she wiped away my smile. 
I never smiled again until 1946. 
There are people in America, there 
are people in the world who deny the 
Holocaust. There are far too many peo-
ple who don’t know the details of what 
happened during the Holocaust, and, 
sadly, these voices, these survivors will 
not be with us for too many more 
years. 
That is why this is so important 
today. That is why it is so important 
for all of us to come together, to pledge

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H563 
January 27, 2020 
‘‘Never again’’ and to make it mean 
something. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the op-
portunity to be here today with my 
colleagues from both sides of the aisle. 
There is nothing partisan about stand-
ing up to hatred and bigotry and fight-
ing anti-Semitism. That is what we are 
showing here tonight. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his comments, 
and I yield to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Today, I had the opportunity to at-
tend the anniversary of the liberation 
of the Auschwitz-Birkenau celebration 
that was held at the United Nations. 
It was a stirring program with testi-
mony from two survivors who told of 
the awful situation they had to sur-
vive, the loss of their parents, the atro-
cious conduct of the Nazis, and a sys-
tematic attempt to destroy the Jewish 
community. 
There were survivors, a lady and a 
man, and the lady said: ‘‘Hitler did not 
win.’’ She had her family with her, and 
she said that her family is a sign that 
Hitler did not win. And he did not win. 
But there is anti-Semitism in this 
world and in this country that is in 
greater numbers and greater volume 
and greater threats than any time 
since the Holocaust. We must stand up 
to it. 
Many of the speakers talked about 
the importance of education and, in-
deed, that is important. 
In 1984, I passed a Holocaust edu-
cation program in the Tennessee Holo-
caust Commission, which exists to this 
day and is now a standing program. We 
need those programs in States, and we 
also need education in the classroom. 
The bill we passed today was important 
and good. But we need to do more than 
just talk about it. 
When the Klan raises its ugly head in 
Charlottesville, Virginia, and other 
places, we have to condemn the Ku 
Klux Klan whose whole basis is against 
African Americans and against Jews 
because of their race and because of 
their religion. 
Every person who is against anti- 
Semitism should be against racism, 
should be against all kinds of intoler-
ance and discrimination because it 
starts with the Jews, but it never ends 
with the Jews. The Jews are, indeed, a 
canary—African Americans have been, 
too—of other problems in the society 
and the ugly head of racism and ethnic 
oppositions based on xenophobic con-
duct, so we have to be concerned. 
When the Klan speaks up, we can’t 
say in any way at all that there are 
fine people among the Klan’s people. 
Nor can we do that with other groups. 
And when David Duke speaks up, we 
have to realize that David Duke hates 
Blacks and hates Jews and needs to be 
condemned by all people on both sides. 
I want to read a quote that I saw on 
social media. I am not a big fan of so-
cial media. I use it to some extent, but 
much of it is hateful. 
But this is from a man who goes by 
the name of Julius Goat. I think his 
real name is A. R. Moxon: 
‘‘Historians have a word for Germans 
who joined the Nazi party, not because 
they hated Jews, but out of a hope for 
restored patriotism, or a sense of eco-
nomic anxiety, or a hope to preserve 
their religious values, or dislike of 
their opponents, or raw political oppor-
tunism, or convenience, or ignorance, 
or greed. 
‘‘That word is ‘Nazi.’ Nobody cares 
about their motives anymore.’’ 
The motives which brought about the 
Nazi Party and the Holocaust need to 
be confronted in its nascent stages, and 
we need to do it when the Klan speaks, 
when David Duke speaks, and others. 
So I want to thank everybody who 
has participated in this Special Order 
and Mr. WEBER for sponsoring it. It was 
an honor to be in New York with so 
many distinguished speakers, and an 
emotional program about the Holo-
caust. ‘‘Never again.’’ 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my 
friends on both sides of the aisle for 
being here to express those sentiments. 
Mr. Speaker, President Roosevelt 
said that December 7, 1941, was a day 
that would live in infamy. On this day, 
75 years ago, a horrific infamy was re-
vealed—one that should never have 
been allowed and one that should never 
ever be allowed. 
Mr. Speaker, 6 million Jews and their 
families were subjected not just to a 
day of infamy, but a lifetime of the 
memory of that kind of infamy and the 
effect it had on their families. They 
will be remembering that horror for a 
long time. My friend from Florida 
talked about the people who come back 
and meet each other since before World 
War II. 
Anti-Semitism, BDS, that kind of in-
famy should not be allowed anywhere 
at any time. 
Mr. Speaker, let us covenant to-
gether that not now, not tomorrow, 
and not ever, never again will it be al-
lowed. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
f 
ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
move that the House do now adjourn. 
The motion was agreed to; accord-
ingly (at 8 o’clock and 37 minutes 
p.m.), under its previous order, the 
House adjourned until tomorrow, Tues-
day, January 28, 2020, at 10 a.m. for 
morning-hour debate.

S579 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 2020 
No. 17 
Senate 
The Senate met at 1:05 p.m. and was 
called to order by the Chief Justice of 
the United States. 
f 
TRIAL 
OF 
DONALD 
J. 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will convene as a Court of Impeach-
ment. 
The Chaplain will lead us in prayer. 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Lord, through all the generations, 
You have been our mighty God. As mil-
lions mourn the deaths of Kobe and 
Gianna Bryant and those who died with 
them, we think about life’s brevity, un-
certainty, and legacy. Remind us that 
we all have a limited time on Earth to 
leave the world better than we found 
it. 
As this impeachment process unfolds, 
give our Senators the desire to make 
the most of their time on Earth. Teach 
them how to live, O God, and lead them 
along the path of honesty. May they 
hear the words of Jesus of Nazareth re-
verberating down the corridors of the 
centuries: ‘‘And you shall know the 
truth, and the truth shall make you 
free.’’ 
And Lord, thank You for giving our 
Chief Justice another birthday. Amen. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Chief Justice led the Pledge of 
Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
THE JOURNAL 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Please be seat-
ed. If there is no objection, the Journal 
of proceedings of the trial is approved 
to date. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Sergeant at Arms will make the 
proclamation. 
The Sergeant at Arms, Michael C. 
Stenger, made the proclamation as fol-
lows: 
Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are 
commanded to keep silence, on pain of im-
prisonment, while the Senate of the United 
States is sitting for the trial of the articles 
of impeachment exhibited by the House of 
Representatives against Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
as the Chaplain has indicated, on be-
half of all of us, happy birthday. I am 
sure this is exactly how you had 
planned to celebrate the day. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you 
very much for those kind wishes, and 
thank you to all the Senators for not 
asking for the yeas and nays. 
(Laughter.) 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. For the informa-
tion of all Senators, we should expect 
to break every 2 or 3 hours and then at 
6 o’clock a break for dinner. 
And with that, Mr. Chief Justice, I 
yield the floor. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to 
the provisions of S. Res. 483, the coun-
sel for the President have 22 hours and 
5 minutes remaining to make the pres-
entation of their case. The Senate will 
now hear you. 
The Senate will now hear you, Mr. 
Sekulow. 
OPENING STATEMENT—CONTINUED 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, man-
agers, what we have done on Saturday 
is the pattern that we are going to con-
tinue today, as far as how we are going 
to deal with the case. We deal with 
transcript evidence. We deal with pub-
licly available information. We do not 
deal with speculation, allegations that 
are not based on evidentiary standards 
at all. 
We are going to highlight some of 
those very facts we talked about very 
quickly on Saturday. You are going to 
hear more about that. I want to give 
you a little bit of an overview of what 
we plan to do today in our presen-
tation. 
You will hear from a number of law-
yers. Each one of these lawyers will be 
addressing a particular aspect of the 
President’s case. I will introduce the 
issues that they are going to discuss, 
and, then, that individual will come up 
and make their presentation. We want 
to do this on an expeditious but yet 
thorough basis. 
Let me start with, just for a very 
brief few moments, taking a look at 
where we were. One of the things that 
became very clear to us as we looked at 
the presentation from the House man-
agers was the lack of focus on that 
July 25 transcript. That is because the 
transcript actually doesn’t say what 
they would like it to say. We have 
heard—and you will hear more—about 
that in the days ahead. We know about 
Mr. SCHIFF’s version of the transcript. 
You heard it. You saw it. 
I want to keep coming back to 
facts—facts that are undisputed. The 
President, in his conversation, was 
clear on a number of points, but so was 
President Zelensky. I mentioned that 
at the close of my arguments earlier, 
that it was President Zelensky who 
said: No pressure, I didn’t feel any pres-
sure. 
And, again, as this kind of reading of 
minds of what people were saying, I 
think we need to look at what they ac-
tually said and how it is backed up. 
It is our position as the President’s 
counsel that the President was at all 
time acting under his constitutional 
authority, under his legal authority, in 
our national interest, and pursuant to 
his oath of office. Asking a foreign 
leader to get to the bottom of issues of 
corruption is not a violation of an 
oath. 
It was interesting because there was 
a lot of discussion the other day about 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, and one 
of the things that we reiterate is that

January 27, 2020 
he himself said that he did not know if 
there was anything of crime or any-
thing of that nature. He had deep pol-
icy concerns. I think that is what this 
is really about—deep policy concerns, 
deep policy differences. 
We live in a constitutional Republic 
where you have deep policy concerns 
and deep differences. That should not 
be the basis of an impeachment. If the 
bar of impeachment has now reached 
that level, then, for the sake of the Re-
public, the danger that puts not just 
this body but our entire constitutional 
framework in is unimaginable. Every 
time there is a policy difference of sig-
nificance or an approach difference of 
significance about a policy, are we 
going to start an impeachment pro-
ceeding? 
As I said earlier, I don’t think this 
was about just a phone call. There was 
a pattern in practice of attempts over 
a 3-year period to not only interfere 
with the President’s capability to gov-
ern—which, by the way, they were 
completely unsuccessful at; just look 
at the state of where we are as a coun-
try—but also interfere with the con-
stitutional framework. 
I am going to say this because I want 
to be brief. We are going to have a se-
ries of lawyers address you. So it will 
not be one lawyer for hours and hours. 
We are going to have a series of law-
yers address you on a variety of issues. 
This is how we envision the President’s 
defense going. We thought it would be 
appropriate to start with an overview, 
if you will, of some of the significant 
historical issues, constitutional issues, 
involving 
impeachment 
proceedings, 
since we don’t have a long history of 
that. I think that is a good thing for 
the country that we don’t, and I think 
that we would all agree. But if this be-
comes the new standard, the future is 
going to look a lot different. 
We are going to hear next from my 
cocounsel Judge Kenneth Starr. Judge 
Starr is a former judge for the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Co-
lumbia. He served as the 39th Solicitor 
General of the United States, arguing 
cases before the Supreme Court of the 
United States on behalf of the United 
States. 
I had the privilege of arguing a case 
alongside Judge Starr—we were talk-
ing about this earlier—many years ago. 
He also served as the independent 
counsel during the Clinton Presidency 
and author of the Starr report. He tes-
tified for almost 12 hours before the Ju-
diciary Committee with regard to that 
report. Judge Starr is very familiar 
with this process. He is going to ad-
dress a series of deficiencies, which are 
legal issues with regard to articles I 
and 
II—constitutional 
implications, 
historical implications, and legal im-
plications of where this case now 
stands. 
I would like to yield my time right 
now to, if it please the Chief Justice, 
Ken Starr. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Starr. 
Mr. Counsel STARR. Thank you. 
Mr. Chief Justice, House Managers, 
and staff, Members of the Senate, the 
majority leader, and the minority lead-
er, at the beginning of these pro-
ceedings on January 16, the Chief Jus-
tice administered the oath of office to 
the Members of this body and then 
again on Tuesday. In doing so, the 
Chief Justice was honoring the words 
of our Constitution, article I, section 3. 
We all know the first sentence of that 
article by heart: ‘‘The Senate shall 
have the sole Power to try all Impeach-
ments.’’ But then the constitutional 
text goes on to say this: ‘‘When sitting 
for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath 
Or Affirmation.’’ That oath or affirma-
tion, in turn, requires each Member of 
the Senate to do impartial justice. 
This constitutionally administered 
oath or affirmation has been given in 
every proceeding in this body since 
1798. Indeed, to signify the importance 
of the occasion, the Senate’s more re-
cent traditions call for you, as you did, 
to sign the book. And that book is not 
simply part of the record; it is en-
trusted to the National Archives. In 
contrast, Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives do not take an oath in 
connection with impeachment. The 
Framers of our Constitution well knew 
when an oath or affirmation should be 
required—the Senate, yes; the House, 
no. Thus, each Member of the world’s 
greatest deliberative body now has spe-
cial—indeed unique—duties and obliga-
tions imposed under our founding docu-
ment. 
During 
the 
Clinton 
impeachment 
trial 21 years ago in this Chamber, the 
Chief Justice of the United States 
ruled in response to an objection that 
was interposed by Senator Tom Harkin 
of Iowa. The Senators are not sitting 
as jurors, Senator Harkin noted, and 
the Chief Justice agreed with that 
proposition. Rather, the Senate is a 
court. In fact, history teaches us that 
for literally decades, this body was re-
ferred to in this context as the High 
Court of Impeachment. So we are not a 
legislative Chamber during these pro-
ceedings. We are in a tribunal. We are 
in court. 
Alexander Hamilton has been quoted 
frequently in these proceedings, but in 
Federalist 78, he was describing the 
role of courts—your role—and in doing 
so, he distinguished between what he 
called the exercise of judgment on the 
one hand, which is what courts do, and 
the exercise of will or policy pref-
erences, if you will, on the other hand. 
That is what legislative bodies do. 
According to Hamilton, courts were 
to be, in his word, ‘‘impartial.’’ There 
is that word again. You know, that is a 
daunting task for judges struggling to 
do the right thing, to be impartial— 
equal justice under law. It is certainly 
hard in life to be impartial. In politics, 
it is not even asked of one to be impar-
tial. But that is the task that the Con-
stitution chose to impose upon each of 
you. 
Significantly, in this particular junc-
ture in America’s history, the Senate 
is being called to sit as the High Court 
of Impeachment all too frequently. In-
deed, we are living in what I think can 
aptly be described as the ‘‘age of im-
peachment.’’ In the House, resolution 
after resolution, month after month, 
has called for the President’s impeach-
ment. 
How did we get here, with Presi-
dential 
impeachment 
invoked 
fre-
quently in its inherently destabilizing, 
as well as acrimonious way? Briefly 
told, the story begins 42 years ago. 
In the wake of the long national 
nightmare of Watergate, Congress and 
President 
Jimmy 
Carter 
collabo-
ratively ushered in a new chapter in 
America’s constitutional history. To-
gether, in full agreement, they enacted 
the independent counsel provisions of 
the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. 
But the new chapter was not simply 
the age of independent counsels; it be-
came, unbeknownst to the American 
people, the age of impeachment. 
During my service in the Reagan ad-
ministration as Counsel and Chief of 
Staff to Attorney General William 
French Smith, the Justice Department 
took the position that, however well- 
intentioned, the independent counsel 
provisions were unconstitutional. Why? 
In the view of the Department, those 
provisions intruded into the rightful 
domain and prerogative of the execu-
tive branch of the Presidency. 
The Justice Department’s position 
was eventually rejected by the Su-
preme Court, but most importantly, in 
helping us understand this new era in 
our country’s history, Justice Antonin 
Scalia was in deep dissent. Among his 
stinging criticisms of that law, Justice 
Scalia wrote this: ‘‘The context of this 
statute is acrid with the smell of 
threatened impeachment.’’ Impeach-
ment. 
Justice Scalia echoed the criticism of 
the court in which I was serving at the 
time, the District of Columbia Circuit, 
which had actually struck down the 
law as unconstitutional in a very im-
pressive opinion by renowned Judge 
Laurence Silberman. 
Why would Justice Scalia refer to 
impeachment? This was a reform meas-
ure. There would be no more Saturday 
Night Massacres—the firing of Special 
Prosecutor, as he was called, Archibald 
Cox by President Nixon. Government 
would now be better, more honest, 
greater accountability, and the inde-
pendent counsel would be protected. 
But the word ‘‘impeachment’’ haunts 
that dissenting opinion, and it is not 
hard to discover why—because the 
statute, by its terms, expressly di-
rected the independent counsel to be-
come, in effect, an agent of the House 
of Representatives. And to what end? 
To report to the House of Representa-
tives when a very low threshold of in-
formation was received that an im-
peachable offense, left undefined, may 
have been committed. 
To paraphrase President Clinton’s 
very able counsel at the time, Bernie 
Nussbaum, this statute is a dagger

January 27, 2020 
aimed at the heart of the Presidency. 
President Clinton, nonetheless, signed 
the reauthorized measure into law, and 
the Nation then went through the long 
process known as Whitewater, result-
ing in the findings by the office which 
I led, the Office of Independent Coun-
sel, and a written report to the House 
of Representatives. That referral to 
Congress was stipulated in the Ethics 
in Government Act of 1978. 
To put it mildly, Democrats were 
very upset about what had happened. 
They then joined Republicans across 
the aisle who, for their part, had been 
outraged by an earlier independent 
counsel investigation, that of a very 
distinguished former judge, Lawrence 
Walsh. 
During the Reagan administration, 
Judge Walsh’s investigation into what 
became known to the country as Iran- 
Contra spawned enormous criticism on 
the Republican side of the aisle, both 
as to the investigation itself but also 
as to statute. 
The 
acrimony 
surrounding 
Iran- 
Contra and then the impeachment and 
the trial and President Clinton’s ac-
quittal by this body led inexorably to 
the end of the independent counsel era. 
Enough was enough. Living through 
that wildly controversial, 21-year, bold 
experiment with the independent coun-
sel statute, Congress, in a bipartisan 
way, had a change of heart. It allowed 
the law to expire in accordance with its 
terms in 1999. 
That would-be and well-intentioned 
reform measure died a quiet and un-
eventful death, and it was promptly re-
placed by Justice Department internal 
regulations promulgated by Attorney 
General Janet Reno during the waning 
months of the President Clinton ad-
ministration. One can review those reg-
ulations and see no reference to im-
peachment—none. No longer were the 
poison pill provisions of Presidential 
impeachment part of America’s legal 
landscape. They were gone. The Reno 
regulation seemed to signal a return to 
traditional norms. Impeachment would 
no longer be embedded in the actual 
laws of the land but returned to the 
language of the Constitution. 
In the meantime, America’s constitu-
tional DNA and its political culture 
had changed. Even with the dawn of 
the new century, the 21st century, ‘‘im-
peachment’’ remained on the lips of 
countless Americans and echoed fre-
quently in the people’s House. The im-
peachment habit proved to be hard to 
kick. 
Ironically, while this was happening 
here at home, across the Atlantic, the 
use of impeachment as a weapon dis-
appeared. In the United Kingdom, from 
which, of course, we inherited the proc-
ess, impeachment was first used more 
than two centuries before those first 
settlers crossed the Atlantic. But upon 
thoughtful examination, a number of 
modern-day parliamentary committees 
looked and found impeachment to be 
obsolete. 
Among other criticisms, Members of 
Parliament came to the view that the 
practice which had last been attempted 
in Britain in 1868 failed to meet modern 
procedural standards of fairness—fair-
ness. 
As Sir William McKay recently re-
marked: ‘‘Impeachment in Britain is 
dead.’’ 
Yet, here at home, in the world’s 
longest standing constitutional Repub-
lic, instead of a once-in-a-century phe-
nomenon, which it had been, Presi-
dential impeachment has become a 
weapon to be wielded against one’s po-
litical opponent. 
In her thoughtful Wall Street Jour-
nal op-ed a week ago, Saturday, Peggy 
Noonan wrote this: 
Impeachment has now been normalized. It 
will not be a once-in-a-generation act but an 
every-administration act. The Democrats 
will regret it when the Republicans are hand-
ing out the pens [for the signing ceremony]. 
When we look back down the cor-
ridors of time, we see that for almost 
our first century as a constitutional re-
public the sword of Presidential im-
peachment remained sheathed. Had 
there been controversial Presidents? 
Oh, yes, indeed. Think of John Adams 
and the Alien and Sedition Acts. Think 
of Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay. 
Were partisan passions occasionally in-
flamed during that first century? Of 
course. 
And lest there be any doubt, the 
early Congresses full well knew how to 
summon impeachment to the floor, in-
cluding against a Member of this 
body—Senator William Blount, of Ten-
nessee. During the Jefferson adminis-
tration, the unsuccessful impeachment 
of Justice Samuel Chase—a surly and 
partial jurist, who was, nonetheless, 
acquitted by this Chamber—became an 
early landmark in maintaining the 
treasured independence of our Federal 
judiciary. 
It took the national convulsion of 
the Civil War, the assassination of Mr. 
Lincoln, and the counter-reconstruc-
tion measures aggressively pursued by 
Mr. Lincoln’s successor, Andrew John-
son, to bring about the Nation’s very 
first Presidential impeachment. Fa-
mously, of course, your predecessors in 
this High Court of Impeachment ac-
quitted the unpopular and controver-
sial Johnson but only by virtue of Sen-
ators from the party of Lincoln break-
ing ranks. 
It was over a century later that the 
Nation returned to the tumultuous 
world of Presidential impeachment, ne-
cessitated by the rank criminality of 
the Nixon administration. In light of 
the rapidly unfolding facts, including 
uncovered by the Senate select com-
mittee, in an overwhelmingly bipar-
tisan vote of 410 to 4, the House of Rep-
resentatives authorized an impeach-
ment inquiry; and, in 1974, the House 
Judiciary Committee, after lengthy 
hearings, voted again in a bipartisan 
manner to impeach the President of 
the United States. Importantly, Presi-
dent Nixon’s own party was slowly but 
inexorably moving toward favoring the 
removal of their chosen leader from 
the Nation’s highest office, who had 
just won reelection by a landslide. 
It bears emphasis before this high 
court that this was the first Presi-
dential impeachment in over 100 years. 
It also bears emphasis that it was pow-
erfully bipartisan. And it was not just 
the vote to authorize the impeachment 
inquiry. Indeed, the House Judiciary 
chair, Peter Rodino, of New Jersey, 
was insistent that, to be accepted by 
the American people, the process had 
to be bipartisan. 
Like war, impeachment is hell or, at 
least, 
Presidential 
impeachment 
is 
hell. Those of us who lived through the 
Clinton impeachment, including Mem-
bers of this body, full well understand 
that a Presidential impeachment is 
tantamount to domestic war. Albeit 
thankfully protected by our beloved 
First Amendment, it is a war of words 
and a war of ideas, but it is filled with 
acrimony, and it divides the country 
like nothing else. Those of us who lived 
through the Clinton impeachment un-
derstand that in a deep and personal 
way. 
Now, in contrast, wisely and judi-
cially conducted, unlike in the United 
Kingdom, impeachment remains a vital 
and appropriate tool in our country to 
serve as a check with respect to the 
Federal judiciary. After all, in the Con-
stitution’s brilliant structural design, 
Federal judges know, as this body full 
well knows from its daily work, of a 
pivotally important feature—independ-
ence from politics—exactly what Alex-
ander Hamilton was talking about in 
Federalist 78: during the Constitution’s 
term, good behavior; in practical ef-
fect, life tenure. Impeachment is, thus, 
a very important protection for we the 
people against what could be serious 
article III wrongdoing within that 
branch. 
And so it is that, when you count, of 
the 63 impeachment inquiries author-
ized by the House of Representatives 
over our history, only 8 have actually 
been convicted in this high court and 
removed from office, and each and 
every one has been a Federal judge. 
This history leads me to reflect on 
the nature of your weighty responsibil-
ities here in this high court as judges 
in the context of Presidential impeach-
ment—the 
fourth 
Presidential 
im-
peachment. I am counting the Nixon 
proceedings in our Nation’s history, 
but the third over the past half cen-
tury. 
And I respectfully submit that the 
Senate, in its wisdom, would do well in 
its deliberations to guide the Nation in 
this world’s greatest deliberative body 
to return to our country’s traditions 
when Presidential impeachment was 
truly a measure of last resort. Mem-
bers of this body can help and in this 
very proceeding restore our constitu-
tional and historical traditions, above 
all, by returning to the text of the Con-
stitution itself. It can do so by its ex-
ample here in these proceedings in 
weaving the tapestry of what can 
rightly be called the common law of

Presidential 
impeachment. 
That 
is 
what courts do. They weave the com-
mon law. There are indications within 
the constitutional text—I will come to 
our history—so that this fundamental 
question is appropriate to be asked— 
you are familiar with the arguments: 
Was there a crime or other violation of 
established law alleged? 
So let’s turn to the text. 
Throughout the Constitution’s de-
scription of impeachment, the text 
speaks always—always—without excep-
tion, in terms of crimes. It begins, of 
course, with treason—the greatest of 
crimes against the state and against 
we the people, but so misused as a 
bludgeon and parliamentary experi-
ence, to lead the Founders to actually 
define the term in the Constitution 
itself. Bribery—an iniquitous form of 
moral and legal corruption and the 
basis of so many of the 63 impeachment 
proceedings over the course of our his-
tory—again, almost all of them against 
judges. 
And 
then 
the 
mysterious 
terms—other high crimes and mis-
demeanors. Once again, the language is 
employing the language of crimes. The 
Constitution is speaking to us in terms 
of crimes. 
Each of those references, when you 
count 
them—count 
seven, 
count 
eight—supports the conclusion that 
impeachments should be evaluated in 
terms of offenses against established 
law but especially with respect to the 
Presidency, where the Constitution re-
quires the Chief Justice of the United 
States and not a political officer—no 
matter how honest, no matter how im-
partial—to preside at trial. Guided by 
history, the Framers made a deliberate 
and wise choice to cabin, to constrain, 
to limit the power of impeachment. 
And so it was, on the very eve of the 
impeachment 
of 
President 
Andrew 
Johnson, that the eminent scholar and 
dean of Columbia Law School, Theo-
dore Dwight, wrote this: ‘‘The weight 
of authority is that no impeachment 
will lie except for a true crime—a 
breach of the law—which would be the 
subject of indictment.’’ I am not mak-
ing that argument. I am noting what 
he is saying. He didn’t over-argue the 
case. He said ‘‘the weight of author-
ity,’’ ‘‘the weight of authority.’’ 
And so this issue is a weighty one. 
Has the House of Representatives, with 
all due respect, in these two Articles of 
Impeachment charged a crime or a vio-
lation of established law or not? This 
is—I don’t want to over-argue—an ap-
propriate and weighty consideration 
for the Senate but especially as I am 
trying to emphasize in the case not of 
a Federal judge but of the President. 
Courts consider prudential factors, and 
there is a huge prudential factor that 
this trial is occurring in an election 
year, when we the people, in a matter 
of months, will go to the polls. 
In developing the common law of 
Presidential impeachment, this thresh-
old factor, consistent with the con-
stitutional text, consistent with the 
Nation’s history and Presidential im-
peachments, as I will seek to dem-
onstrate, serves as a clarifying and sta-
bilizing element. It increases predict-
ability—to do what?—to reduce the 
profound danger that a Presidential 
impeachment will be dominated by 
partisan considerations—precisely the 
evil that the Framers warned about. 
And so to history. 
History bears out the point. The Na-
tion’s 
most 
recent 
experience—the 
Clinton impeachment—even though se-
verely and roundly criticized, charged 
crimes. These were crimes proven in 
the crucible of the House of Represent-
atives’ debate beyond any reasonable 
observer’s doubt. 
So too the Nixon impeachment. The 
articles charged crimes. What about ar-
ticle II in Nixon, which is sometimes 
referred to as abuse of power? Was that 
the abuse of power article—the pre-
cursor to article I that is before this 
court? Not at all. When one returns to 
article II in Nixon—approved by a bi-
partisan House Judiciary Committee— 
article II of Nixon sets forth a deeply 
troubling story of numerous crimes— 
not one, not two, numerous crimes— 
carried out at the direction of the 
President himself. 
And so the appropriate question: 
Were crimes alleged in the articles of 
the common law of Presidential im-
peachment? In Nixon, yes. In Clinton, 
yes. Here, no—a factor to be considered 
as the judges of the high court. 
Come, as you will, individually to 
your judgment. 
Even in the political cauldron of the 
Andrew Johnson impeachment, article 
XI charged a violation of the con-
troversial Tenure of Office Act. You 
are familiar with it. And that act 
warned expressly the Oval Office; that 
its violation would institute a high 
misdemeanor, employing the very lan-
guage of constitutionally cognizable 
crimes. 
This history represents, and I be-
lieve, may it please the court, it em-
bodies the common law of Presidential 
impeachment. These are facts gleaned 
from the constitutional text and from 
the gloss of the Nation’s history. 
And under this view, the commission 
of an alleged crime, the violation of es-
tablished law, can appropriately be 
considered, again, a weighty and an im-
portant consideration and element of a 
historically supportable Presidential 
impeachment. 
Will law professors agree with this? 
No, but with all due respect to the 
academy, this is not an academic gath-
ering. We are in court. We are not just 
in court. With all due respect to the 
Chief Justice and the Supreme Court of 
the United States, we are in democ-
racy’s ultimate court. 
And the better constitutional answer 
to the question is provided by a rig-
orous and faithful examination of the 
constitutional text and then looking 
faithfully and respectfully to our his-
tory. 
The very divisive Clinton impeach-
ment demonstrates that, while highly 
relevant, the commission of a crime is 
by no means sufficient to warrant the 
removal of our duly elected President. 
Why? 
This body knows. We appoint judges 
and you confirm them and they are 
there for life. Not Presidents. And the 
Presidency is unique. The Presidency 
stands alone in our constitutional 
framework. 
Before he became the Chief Justice of 
the United States, John Marshall, then 
sitting as a Member of the people’s 
House, made a speech on the floor of 
the House, and there he said this: 
The President is the sole organ of the Na-
tion in its external relations, and its sole 
representative with foreign nations. 
If that sounds like hyperbole, it has 
been embraced over decades by the Su-
preme Court of the United States, by 
Justices appointed by many different 
Presidents. The Presidency is unique. 
There is no other system quite like 
ours, and it has served us well. 
And so as to the Presidency, im-
peachment and removal not only over-
turns a national election and perhaps 
profoundly affects an upcoming elec-
tion, in the words of Yale’s Akhil 
Amar, it entails a risk, and these are 
Akhil’s words, Professor Amar’s, ‘‘a 
grave disruption of the government.’’ 
Professor Amar penned those words in 
connection with the Clinton impeach-
ment. ‘‘Grave disruption of the govern-
ment.’’ Regardless of what the Presi-
dent has done, ‘‘grave disruption.’’ 
We will all agree that the Presidents, 
under the text of the Constitution and 
its amendments, are to serve out their 
term absent a genuine national con-
sensus, reflected by the two-thirds ma-
jority requirement of this court, that 
the President must go away. Two- 
thirds. In politics and in impeachment, 
that is called a landslide. 
Here, I respectfully submit to the 
court, that all fairminded persons will 
surely agree there is no national con-
sensus. We might wish for one, but 
there isn’t. To the contrary, for the 
first time in America’s modern history, 
not a single House Member of the 
President’s party supported either of 
the two Articles of Impeachment—not 
one, not in committee, not on the 
House floor. 
And that pivotal fact puts in bold re-
lief the Peter Rodino principle—call it 
the Rodino rule—impeachment must be 
bipartisan in nature. 
Again, sitting as a court, this body 
should signal to the Nation the return 
to our traditions—bipartisan impeach-
ments. 
What is the alternative? Will the 
President be King? Do oversight. The 
tradition of oversight—an enormous 
check on Presidential power through-
out our history, and it continues avail-
able today. 
In Iran-Contra, no impeachment was 
undertaken. The Speaker of the House, 
a Democrat, Jim Wright from Texas, 
from Fort Worth, where the West be-
gins, knew better. He said no. But as 
befits the age of impeachment, a House

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S583 
January 27, 2020 
resolution to impeach President Ron-
ald Reagan was introduced. It was 
filed, and the effort to impeach Presi-
dent Reagan was supported by a lead-
ing law professor whose name you 
would well recognize, and you will hear 
it again this evening from Professor 
Dershowitz. I will leave to it him to 
identify the learned professor. But the 
Speaker of the people’s House, emu-
lating Peter Rodino, said no. 
So I, respectfully, submit that the 
Senate should close this chapter, this 
idiosyncratic chapter, on this increas-
ingly disruptive act, this era, this age 
of resorting to the Constitution’s ulti-
mate democratic weapon for the Presi-
dency. Let the people decide. 
There was a great Justice who sat for 
30 years, Justice John Harlan, in the 
mid-century of the 20th century. And 
in a lawsuit involving a very basic 
question: Can citizens whose rights 
have clearly been violated by Federal 
law enforcement agencies and agents 
bring an action for damages when Con-
gress has not so provided—no law that 
gave the wounded citizen a right to re-
dress through damages? 
And Justice Harlan, in a magnificent 
concurring opinion in Bivens v. Six 
Unnamed Federal Agents, suggested 
that courts—here you are—should take 
into consideration in reaching its judg-
ment—their judgment—what he called 
factors counseling restraint. 
He was somewhat reluctant to say 
that we, the Supreme Court, should 
grant this right, that we should create 
it when Congress hasn’t acted and Con-
gress could have acted, but it hadn’t. 
But he reluctantly came to the conclu-
sion that the Constitution itself em-
powered the Federal courts to create 
this right for our injured citizens, to 
give them redress, not just an injunc-
tive relief but damages, money recov-
ery, for violations of their constitu-
tional rights. Factors counseling re-
straint. And he addressed them, and he 
came to the view—it was so honest— 
and said: I came to the case with a dif-
ferent view, but I changed my mind 
and voted in favor of the Bivens family 
having redress against the Federal 
agents who had violated their rights, 
judging in its most impartial, elegant 
sense. 
I am going to draw from Justice Har-
lan’s matrix of factors counseling re-
straint and simply identify these. I 
think there may be others. 
The articles do not charge a crime 
for violations established. I am sug-
gesting it is a relevant factor. I think 
it is a weighty factor, when we come to 
Presidential impeachment, not judicial 
impeachment. 
Secondly, the articles come to you 
with no bipartisan support. They come 
to you as a violation of what I am dub-
bing the Rodino rule. 
And third, as I will now discuss, the 
pivotally important issue of process, 
the second Article of Impeachment: 
Obstruction of Congress. 
This court is very familiar with 
United States v. Nixon. Its unanimity 
in recognizing the President’s profound 
interest in confidentiality, regardless 
of the world view or philosophy of the 
justice, the Justices were unanimous. 
This isn’t just a contrivance; it is built 
into the very nature of our constitu-
tional order. So let me comment, brief-
ly. 
This constitutionally based recogni-
tion of executive privilege and then 
companion privileges—the deliberative 
process privilege, the immunity of 
close Presidential advisers from being 
summoned to testify—these are all 
firmly established in our law. 
If there is a dispute between the peo-
ple’s House and the President of the 
United States over the availability of 
documents or witnesses—and there is 
in each and every administration—then 
go to court. It really is as simple as 
that. I don’t need to belabor the point. 
But here is the point I would like to 
emphasize. Frequently, the Justice De-
partment advises the President of the 
United States that the protection of 
the Presidency calls—whatever the 
President might want to do as a polit-
ical matter, as an accommodation in 
the spirit of comity—to protect privi-
leged conversations and communica-
tions. 
I have heard it, in my two tours of 
duty at the Justice Department: Don’t 
release the documents, Mr. President. 
If you do, you are injuring the Presi-
dency. Go to court. 
We have heard concerns about the 
length of time that the litigation 
might take. Those of us who have liti-
gated know that sometimes litigation 
does take longer than we would like. 
Justice delayed is justice denied. We 
could all agree with that. 
But our history—Churchill’s maxim, 
study history—our history tells us that 
is not necessarily so. Take by way of 
example the Pentagon Papers case—or-
ders issued preventing and sanctioning 
a gross violation of the First Amend-
ment’s guarantee of freedom of the 
press, an order issued out of the dis-
trict court June 15, 1971. That order 
was reversed in an opinion by the Su-
preme Court of the United States 2 
weeks later. June 15. 
The House of Representatives could 
have followed that well-trodden path. 
It could have sought expedition. The E. 
Barrett Prettyman Courthouse is 6 
blocks down. The judges are there. 
They are all very able. They are hard- 
working people of integrity. Follow the 
path. Follow the path of the law. Go to 
court. 
There would have been at least one 
problem had the House seen fit to go to 
court and remain in court. The issue is 
before you. 
But among other flaws, the Office of 
Legal Counsel determined—and I have 
read the opinion, and I believe it is cor-
rect—that with all respect, all House 
subpoenas issued prior to the adoption 
of H.R. 660, which for the first time au-
thorized the impeachment inquiry as a 
House, all subpoenas were invalid. 
They were void. With all due respect to 
the Speaker of the House of Represent-
atives, with all her abilities and her 
vast experience, under our Constitu-
tion, she was powerless to do what she 
purported to do. As has been said now 
time and again, especially throughout 
the fall, the Constitution does entrust 
the sole power of impeachment to the 
House of Representatives, but that is 
the House, its 435 Members elected 
from across the constitutional Repub-
lic—not one, no matter how able she 
may be. In the people’s House, every 
Congressperson gets a vote. We know 
the concept: one person, one vote. 
More generally, the President, as I 
reviewed the record, has consistently 
and scrupulously followed the advice 
and counsel of the Justice Department 
and, in particular, the Office of Legal 
Counsel. He has been obedient. As you 
know, that important office—many of 
you have had your own experiences 
professionally 
with 
that 
office—is 
staffed with lawyers of great ability. It 
has a reputation for superb work. It 
has done such thoughtful work with 
both Democratic and Republican ad-
ministrations. The office is now headed 
by a brilliant lawyer who served as a 
law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy. 
The House may disagree with the 
guidance provided to the President by 
that office; the House frequently does 
disagree. But for the President to fol-
low the guidance of the Department of 
Justice with respect to an interbranch 
legal and constitutional dispute cannot 
reasonably be viewed as an obstruction 
and, most emphatically, not as an im-
peachable offense. 
History, once again, is a great teach-
er. In the Clinton impeachment, the 
House Judiciary Committee rejected a 
draft article asserting that President 
Clinton—and here are the words that 
were drafted: ‘‘fraudulently and cor-
ruptly asserted executive privilege.’’ 
Strong words, ‘‘fraudulently and cor-
ruptly.’’ That was the draft article. 
In my view, having lived through the 
facts and with all due respect to the 
former President, he did. He did it time 
and again, month after month. We 
would go to court, and we would win. 
Many members—not everybody—on the 
House Judiciary Committee agreed 
that the President had, indeed, improp-
erly 
claimed 
executive 
privilege, 
rebuffed time and again by the Judici-
ary. But at the end of the day, that 
Committee, the Judiciary Committee 
of the House, chaired by Henry Hyde, 
wisely concluded that President Clin-
ton’s doing so should not be considered 
an impeachable offense. 
Here is the idea. It is not an impeach-
able offense for the President of the 
United States to defend the asserted 
legal and constitutional prerogatives of 
the Presidency. 
This is, and I am quoting here from 
page 55 of the President’s trial brief, ‘‘a 
function of his constitutional and pol-
icy judgments,’’ not just a policy judg-
ment, but a constitutional judgment. 
I would guide this court, as it is com-
ing through the deliberation process,

S584 
January 27, 2020 
to read the President’s trial brief with 
respect to process. It was Justice Felix 
Frankfurter, confidante of FDR, bril-
liant jurist, who reminded America 
that the history of liberty is in large 
measure the history of process, proce-
dure. 
In particular, I would guide the high 
court to the discussion of the long his-
tory of the House of Representatives— 
over two centuries—in providing due 
process protections in its impeachment 
investigations. It is a richly historical 
discussion. 
The good news is, you can read the 
core of it in four pages, pages 62 to 66, 
of the trial brief. It puts in bold relief, 
I believe, an irrefutable fact. This 
House of Representatives, with all re-
spect, sought to turn its back on its 
own 
established 
procedures—proce-
dures that have been followed faith-
fully decade after decade, regardless of 
who was in control, regardless of polit-
ical party. All those procedures were 
torn asunder and all over the vigorous 
objections of the unanimous and vocal 
minority. 
I need not remind this high court 
that in this country, minority rights 
are important. Minority rights should 
be protected. Equal justice. 
But, then again, the House Members 
took no oath to be impartial. The Con-
stitution didn’t require them to say by 
oath or affirmation: We will do impar-
tial 
judgment—justice. 
When 
they 
chose to tear asunder their procedures, 
they were oathless. They could toss out 
their own rule book through raw 
power. 
Here we have—tragically for the 
country and, I believe, tragically for 
the House of Representatives—in arti-
cle II of these impeachment articles a 
runaway House. It has run away not 
only from its longstanding procedures; 
it has run away from the Constitu-
tion’s demand of fundamental fairness 
captured in those hallowed terms, ‘‘due 
process of law.’’ We have cared about 
this as an English-speaking people 
since the Magna Carta. 
By doing so, however, the House has 
inadvertently pointed this court to an 
exit ramp. It is an exit ramp provided 
by the Constitution itself. It is an exit 
ramp built by the most noble of build-
ers, the founding generation. Despite 
the clearest precedent requiring due 
process for the accused in an impeach-
ment inquiry but, surely, all the more 
so in a Presidential impeachment, 
House Democrats chose to conduct a 
wholly unprecedented process in this 
case, and they did so knowingly and de-
liberately because they were warned at 
every turn: Don’t do it. Don’t do it that 
way. 
And process—the process of being de-
nied the basic rights that have been af-
forded to every single accused Presi-
dent in the history of the Republic, 
even to the racist Andrew Johnson 
seeking to undo Mr. Lincoln’s great 
legacy—he got those rights—but not 
here. Due process could have been hon-
ored; basic rights could have been hon-
ored. The House rules, the House’s tra-
ditions could have been honored, but 
what is done is done. These two arti-
cles come before this court, this High 
Court of Impeachment, dripping with 
fundamental process violations. 
The courts—and you are the court— 
are confronted with this kind of phe-
nomenon, a train of fairness violations. 
Courts of this country do the right 
thing. They do impartial justice. They 
invoke, figuratively or literally, the 
words of the preamble to America’s 
Constitution. The very first order of 
our government after ‘‘to form a more 
perfect Union’’ is to ‘‘establish Jus-
tice’’—to ‘‘establish justice.’’ Even be-
fore getting to the words to ‘‘provide 
for the common Defense, to promote 
the general Welfare, to insure domestic 
Tranquility,’’ the Constitution speaks 
in terms of justice—establishing jus-
tice. 
Courts would not allow this. They 
would not allow this because—why? 
They knew, and they know, that the 
purpose of our founding instrument is 
to protect our liberties, to safeguard 
us, but to safeguard us as individuals 
against the powers of government. 
Why? In the benedictory words of the 
preamble, to ‘‘secure the Blessings of 
Liberty to ourselves and our Pos-
terity.’’ Liberty under law. 
I thank the court. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, House 
managers: Judge Starr laid out before 
you the solemn nature of these pro-
ceedings. I want to contrast the solemn 
nature of these proceedings and what 
has been laid out before us from both a 
historical and constitutional perspec-
tive. 
I want you to think about this, to 
history, the importance and solemnity 
of what we are engaged in in this body, 
with what took place in the House of 
Representatives upon the signing of 
Articles of Impeachment—pens distrib-
uted to the impeachment managers. A 
celebratory 
moment—think 
about 
that; think about this—a poignant mo-
ment. 
We are next going to address a fac-
tual analysis. To briefly reflect, my 
colleague, the Deputy White House 
Counsel, Mike Purpura, will be joining 
us in a moment to discuss more of the 
facts, to continue the discussion that 
we had on Saturday. But let me just 
recap very quickly what was laid out 
on Saturday. 
First, the transcript shows that the 
President did not condition either se-
curity assistance or a meeting on any-
thing. The paused security assistance 
funds aren’t even mentioned on the 
call. 
Second, 
President 
Zelensky 
and 
other Ukrainian officials repeatedly 
said there was no quid pro quo and no 
pressure on them to review anything. 
Third, President Zelensky and high- 
ranking Ukrainian officials did not 
even know the security assistance was 
paused until the end of August, over a 
month after the July 25 call. 
Fourth, not a single witness testified 
that the President himself said that 
there was any connection between any 
investigation, security assistance, a 
Presidential meeting, or anything else. 
Fifth, the security assistance flowed 
on September 11, and a Presidential 
meeting took place on September 25 
without the Ukrainian Government— 
without the Ukrainian Government— 
announcing any investigations. 
Finally, in the blind drive to impeach 
the President, President Trump, in re-
ality, strategically, has been the best 
friend and supporter of Ukraine, cer-
tainly, in our recent history. These are 
the facts. That is what is before you. 
Deputy White House Counsel Mike 
Purpura will now address additional 
facts related to these proceedings. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, good 
afternoon. I would inform the leader 
that I believe we will be ready to take 
a break at the conclusion of my re-
marks, if it meets with his approval. 
On Saturday, we walked through 
some of the evidence that the House 
managers put forward and didn’t put 
forward during their 21-plus hours of 
presentation. The evidence that we re-
counted was drawn directly from the 
House managers’ own record, the case 
they chose to submit to this Chamber. 
To echo my colleague Mr. Sekulow 
briefly, the House managers’ own evi-
dence shows that President Trump did 
not condition anything on investiga-
tions during the July 25 call with 
President Zelensky and did not even 
mention the pause on the security as-
sistance 
on 
the 
call. 
President 
Zelensky said that he felt no pressure 
on the call. 
President 
Zelensky 
and 
the 
top 
Ukrainian officials did not learn of the 
pause on the security assistance until 
more than a month after the July 25 
call, and the House managers’ own 
record—their record that they devel-
oped and brought before this Cham-
ber—reflects that anyone who spoke 
with the President said that the Presi-
dent made clear that there was no link-
age between security assistance and in-
vestigations. 
There is another category of evidence 
that demonstrated that the pause on 
security assistance was distinct and 
unrelated to investigations. The Presi-
dent released the aid without the 
Ukrainians ever announcing any inves-
tigations or undertaking any investiga-
tions. 
Here is Ambassador Sondland.

Ms. STEFANIK. And the fact is the aid was 
given to Ukraine without any announcement 
of new investigations? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. That’s correct. 
Ms. STEFANIK. And President Trump did 
in fact meet with President Zelensky in Sep-
tember at the United Nations, correct? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. He did. 
Ms. STEFANIK. And there was no an-
nouncement of investigations before this 
meeting? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Correct. 
Ms. STEFANIK. And there was no an-
nouncement of investigations after this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S585 
January 27, 2020 
Ambassador SONDLAND. That’s right. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. So while the 
security assistance was paused, the ad-
ministration did precisely what you 
would expect. It addressed President 
Trump’s concerns about the two issues 
that I mentioned on Saturday: burden- 
sharing and corruption. 
A number of law- and policymakers 
also contacted the President and the 
White House to provide input on the se-
curity assistance issue during this pe-
riod, including Senator LINDSEY GRA-
HAM. The process culminated on Sep-
tember 11, 2019. On that day, the Presi-
dent spoke with Vice President PENCE 
and Senator ROB PORTMAN. The Vice 
President, in NSC Senior Director Tim 
Morrison’s words, was ‘‘armed with his 
conversation with President Zelensky 
from their meeting just days earlier in 
Warsaw, Poland, and both the Vice 
President and Senator PORTMAN
re-
lated their view of the importance of 
the assistance to Ukraine and con-
vinced the President that the aid 
should be disbursed immediately. After 
the meeting, President Trump termi-
nated the pause, and the support 
flowed to Ukraine.’’ 
I want to take a step back now and 
talk for a moment about why the secu-
rity assistance was briefly paused— 
again, in the words of the House man-
agers’ own witnesses. Witness after 
witness 
testified 
that 
confronting 
Ukrainian corruption should be at the 
forefront of U.S. foreign policy towards 
Ukraine. They also testified that the 
President had longstanding and sincere 
concerns about corruption in Ukraine. 
The House managers, however, told 
you that it was laughable to think that 
the President cared about corruption 
in Ukraine, but that is not what the 
witnesses said. 
According to Ambassador Volker, 
President Trump demonstrated that he 
had a very deeply rooted negative view 
of Ukraine based on past corruption, 
and that is a reasonable position, ac-
cording to Ambassador Volker. Most 
people 
who 
know 
anything 
about 
Ukraine would think that. 
Dr. Hill testified: 
I think the President has actually quite 
publicly said that he was very skeptical 
about corruption in Ukraine. And, in fact, he 
is not alone, because everyone has expressed 
great concerns about corruption in Ukraine. 
The House managers have said the 
President’s concern with corruption is 
disingenuous. They said that President 
Trump didn’t care about corruption in 
2017 or 2018 and he certainly didn’t care 
about it in 2019. Those were their 
words. Not according to Ambassador 
Yovanovitch, however, who testified 
that President Trump shared his con-
cern about corruption directly with 
President 
Poroshenko—President 
Zelensky’s predecessor—in their first 
meeting in the Oval Office. When was 
that meeting? In June of 2017—2017. 
The President also has well-known 
concerns about foreign aid generally. 
Scrutinizing and in some cases cur-
tailing foreign aid was a central plank 
of his campaign platform. President 
Trump is especially wary of sending 
American 
taxpayer 
dollars 
abroad 
when other countries refuse to pitch in. 
Mr. Morrison and Mr. Hale both tes-
tified 
at 
length 
about 
President 
Trump’s longstanding concern with 
burden-sharing in foreign aid pro-
grams. Here is what they said. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. The President was con-
cerned that the United States seemed to bear 
the exclusive brunt of security assistance to 
Ukraine. He wanted to see the Europeans 
step up and contribute more security assist-
ance. 
Mr. HALE. We’ve often heard at the State 
Department that the President of the United 
States wants to make sure that foreign as-
sistance is reviewed scrupulously and make 
sure that it is truly in the U.S. national in-
terests and that we evaluate it continuously 
and that it meets certain criteria the Presi-
dent has established. 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. And has the President 
expressed that he expected our allies to give 
their fair share of foreign aid as evidenced by 
the point that he raised during the July 25th 
phone call to President Zelensky to that ef-
fect? 
Mr. HALE. The principle of fair burden- 
sharing by allies and other like-minded 
states is an important element of the foreign 
assistance review. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. The Presi-
dent expressed these precise concerns 
to Senator RON JOHNSON, who wrote: 
He reminded me how thoroughly corrupt 
Ukraine was and again conveyed his frustra-
tion that Europe doesn’t do its fair share of 
providing military aid. 
The House managers didn’t tell you 
about this. Why not? And President 
Trump was right to be concerned that 
other countries weren’t paying their 
fair share. As Laura Cooper testified, 
U.S. contributions to Ukraine are far 
more significant than any individual 
country, and she also said EU funds 
tend to be on the economic side rather 
than for defense and security. Senator 
JOHNSON
also confirmed that other 
countries refused to provide the lethal 
defensive weapons that Ukraine needs 
in its war with Russia. 
Please keep in mind also that the 
pause of the Ukraine security assist-
ance program was far from unusual or 
out of character for President Trump. 
The American people know that the 
President is skeptical of foreign aid 
and that one of his top campaign prom-
ises and priorities in office has been to 
avoid wasteful spending of American 
taxpayer dollars abroad. 
Meanwhile, the same people who 
today claimed that President Trump 
was not genuinely concerned about 
burden-sharing were upset when, as a 
candidate, President Trump criticized 
free-riding by NATO members. 
This past summer, the administra-
tion paused, reviewed, and in some 
cases canceled hundreds of millions of 
dollars in foreign aid to Afghanistan, 
El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and 
Lebanon. These are just some of the re-
views of foreign aid undertaken at the 
very same time that the Ukraine aid 
was paused. 
So what happened during the brief 
period of time while the Ukraine secu-
rity assistance was paused? People 
were gathering information and moni-
toring the facts on the ground in 
Ukraine as the new Parliament was 
sworn in and began introducing anti- 
corruption legislation. 
Notwithstanding 
what 
the 
House 
managers would have you believe, the 
reason for the pause was no secret 
within the White House and the agen-
cies. According to Mr. Morrison, in a 
July meeting attended by officials 
throughout the executive branch agen-
cies, the reason provided for the pause 
by a representative of the Office of 
Management and Budget was that the 
President was concerned about corrup-
tion in Ukraine and he wanted to make 
sure Ukraine was doing enough to man-
age that corruption. In fact, as Mr. 
Morrison testified, by Labor Day, there 
had been definitive developments to 
demonstrate that President Zelensky 
was committed to the issues he cam-
paigned on: anti-corruption reforms. 
Mr. Morrison also testified that the 
administration was working on answer-
ing the President’s concerns regarding 
burden-sharing. Here is Mr. Morrison. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. CASTOR. Was there any interagency 
activity by either the State Department or 
the Defense Department coordinated by the 
National Security Council to look into that 
a little bit for the President? 
Mr. MORRISON. We were surveying the 
data to understand who was contributing 
what and sort of in what categories. 
Mr. CASTOR. And so the President evinced 
concerns. The interagency tried to address 
them? 
Mr. MORRISON. Yes. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. How else do 
we know that the President was await-
ing information on burden-sharing and 
anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine be-
fore releasing the security assistance? 
Because that is what Vice President 
PENCE told President Zelensky. 
On September 1, 2019, Vice President 
PENCE met with President Zelensky. 
President Trump was scheduled to at-
tend the World War II commemoration 
in Poland but instead remained in the 
United States to manage the emer-
gency response to Hurricane Dorian. 
Remember, this was 3 days—3 days— 
after 
President 
Zelensky 
learned 
through the POLITICO article about 
the review of the security assistance. 
Just as Vice President PENCE and his 
aides anticipated, Jennifer Williams 
testified that once the cameras left the 
room, the very first question that 
President Zelensky had was about the 
status of the security assistance. The 
Vice President responded by asking 
about two things: burden-sharing and 
corruption. 
Here is how Jennifer Williams de-
scribed it: 
And the VP responded by really expressing 
our ongoing support for Ukraine, but want-
ing to hear from President Zelensky, you 
know, what the status of his reform efforts 
were that he could then convey back to the 
President, and also wanting to hear if there

January 27, 2020 
was more that European countries could do 
to support Ukraine. 
Vice President PENCE knows Presi-
dent Trump, and he knew what Presi-
dent Trump wanted to hear from Presi-
dent Zelensky. The Vice President was 
echoing the President’s two recurring 
themes: corruption and burden-sharing. 
It is the same, consistent themes every 
time. 
Ambassador Taylor received a simi-
lar readout of the meeting between the 
Vice President and President Zelensky, 
including the Vice President’s focus on 
corruption and burden-sharing. Here is 
Ambassador Taylor. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. On the evening of 
September 1st, I received a readout of the 
Pence-Zelensky meeting over the phone from 
Mr. Morrison during which he told me that 
President Zelensky had opened the meeting 
by immediately asking the Vice President 
about the security cooperation. The Vice 
President did not respond substantively but 
said that he would talk to President Trump 
that night. The Vice President did say that 
President Trump wanted the Europeans to 
do more to support Ukraine and that he 
wanted the Ukrainians to do more to fight 
corruption. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. On Sep-
tember 11, based on the information 
collected and presented to President 
Trump, the President lifted the pause 
on the security assistance. As Mr. Mor-
rison explained, ‘‘our process gave the 
President the confidence he needed to 
approve the release of the security-sec-
tor assistance.’’ 
The House managers say that the 
talk about corruption and burden-shar-
ing is a ruse. No one knew why the se-
curity assistance was paused, and no 
one was addressing the President’s con-
cerns with Ukrainian corruption and 
burden-sharing. The House managers’ 
own evidence—their own record—tells 
a different story, however. They didn’t 
tell you about this, not in 21 hours. 
Why not? 
The President’s concerns were ad-
dressed in the ordinary course. The 
President wasn’t caught, as the House 
managers allege. The managers are 
wrong. All of this, together with what 
we 
discussed 
on 
Saturday, 
dem-
onstrates that there was no connection 
between security assistance and inves-
tigations. 
When the House managers realized 
their ‘‘quid pro quo’’ theory on security 
assistance was falling apart, they cre-
ated a second alternative theory. Ac-
cording to the House managers, Presi-
dent Zelensky desperately wanted a 
meeting at the White House with Presi-
dent Trump, and President Trump con-
ditioned that meeting on investiga-
tions. 
What about the managers’ backup ac-
cusations? Do they fare any better 
than their quid pro quo for security as-
sistance? No. No, they don’t. 
A Presidential-level meeting hap-
pened without any preconditions at the 
first available opportunity in a widely 
televised meeting at the United Na-
tions General Assembly in New York 
on September 25, 2019. The White House 
was working to schedule the meeting 
earlier at the White House or in War-
saw, but those options fell through due 
to normal scheduling and a hurricane. 
The two Presidents met at the earliest 
convenience 
without 
President 
Zelensky ever announcing or beginning 
any investigations. 
The first thing to know about the al-
leged quid pro quo for a meeting is that 
by the end of the July 25 call, the 
President 
had 
invited 
President 
Zelensky to the White House on three 
separate occasions, each time without 
any preconditions. 
President Trump invited President 
Zelensky to an in-person meeting on 
their initial April 21 call. He said: 
‘‘When you’re settled in and ready, I’d 
like to invite you to the White House.’’ 
On May 29, the week after President 
Zelensky’s 
inauguration, 
President 
Trump sent a congratulatory letter, 
again, inviting President Zelensky to 
the White House. He said: 
As you prepare to address the many chal-
lenges facing Ukraine, please know that the 
American people are with you and are com-
mitted to helping Ukraine realize its vast po-
tential. To help show that commitment, I 
would like to invite you to meet with me at 
the White House in Washington, D.C., as 
soon as we can find a mutually convenient 
time. 
Then, on July 25, President Trump 
personally invited President Zelensky 
to participate in a meeting for a third 
time. He said: Whenever you would like 
to come to the White House, feel free 
to call. Give us a date, and we’ll work 
that out. I look forward to seeing you. 
Those are three separate invitations 
for a meeting, all made without any 
preconditions. 
During this time, and behind the 
scenes, the White House was working 
diligently to schedule a meeting be-
tween the Presidents at the earliest 
possible date. Tim Morrison, whose re-
sponsibilities included helping to ar-
range head-of-state visits to the White 
House or other head-of-state meetings, 
testified that he understood that ar-
ranging the White House visit with 
President Zelensky was a do-out that 
came from the President. 
The House managers didn’t mention 
the work that the White House was 
doing to schedule the meeting between 
President 
Trump 
and 
President 
Zelensky; did they? Why not? 
Scheduling a Presidential meeting 
takes time. Mr. Morrison testified that 
his directorate, which was just one of 
several, had a dozen schedule requests 
in with the President for meetings with 
foreign leaders that we were looking to 
land and Ukraine was but one of those 
requests. 
According to Mr. Morrison, due to 
both Presidents’ busy schedule, ‘‘it be-
came clear that the ‘earliest oppor-
tunity for the two Presidents to meet 
would be in Warsaw’ at the beginning 
of September.’’ 
The entire notion that a bilateral 
meeting between President Trump and 
President Zelensky was somehow con-
ditioned on a statement about inves-
tigations is completely defeated by one 
straightforward fact: A bilateral meet-
ing between President Trump and 
President Zelensky was planned for 
September 1 in Warsaw—the same War-
saw meeting we were just discussing— 
without the Ukrainians saying a word 
about investigations. 
As it turned out, President Trump 
was not able to attend the meeting in 
Warsaw because of Hurricane Dorian. 
President Trump asked Vice President 
PENCE to attend in his place, but even 
that scheduling glitch did not put off 
their 
meeting 
for 
long. 
President 
Trump and President Zelensky met at 
the next available date, September 25, 
on the sidelines of the United Nations 
General Assembly. 
As President Zelensky, himself, has 
said, there were ‘‘no preconditions’’ for 
his meeting with President Trump. 
Those are his words: ‘‘No conditions.’’ 
You are probably wondering how the 
House managers could claim there was 
a quid pro quo for a meeting with 
President Trump when the two Presi-
dents actually did meet without Presi-
dent Zelensky announcing any inves-
tigations? Well, the House managers 
moved the goalpost again. They claim 
that the meeting couldn’t be just an in- 
person meeting with President Trump. 
What it had to be was a meeting at the 
Oval Office and in the White House. 
That is nonsense. 
Putting to one side the absurdity of 
the House managers trying to remove a 
duly-elected President of the United 
States from office because he met with 
a world leader in one location versus 
another, this theory has no basis in 
fact. 
As Dr. Hill testified, what mattered 
was that there was a bilateral Presi-
dential meeting, not the location of the 
meeting. She said: 
[I]t wasn’t always a White House meeting 
per se, but definitely a Presidential-level, 
you know, meeting with Zelensky and the 
President. I mean, it could’ve taken place in 
Poland, in Warsaw. It could’ve been, you 
know, a proper bilateral in some other con-
text. But, in other words, a White House- 
level Presidential meeting. 
The House managers didn’t tell you 
about Dr. Hill’s testimony. Why not? In 
fact, just last week they said that 
President Zelensky still hasn’t gotten 
his White House meeting. Why didn’t 
they tell you about Dr. Hill’s testi-
mony so you would have the full con-
text and information? They spoke for 
over 21 hours. They couldn’t take a 
couple of minutes to give you that con-
text? How else do we know that Dr. 
Hill was right? Because President 
Zelensky said so on the July 25 call. 
Remember, when President Trump 
invited President Zelensky to Wash-
ington on the July 25 call, President 
Zelensky said he would be ‘‘happy to 
meet with you personally’’ and offered 
to host President Trump in Ukraine or, 
on the other hand, meet with President 
Trump on September 1 in Poland. That 
is exactly what the administration 
planned to do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S587 
January 27, 2020 
If it weren’t for Hurricane Dorian, 
President Trump would have met with 
President Zelensky in Poland on Sep-
tember 1, just as President Zelensky 
had requested and without any pre-
conditions. 
As it happened, President Zelensky 
met with the Vice President instead 
and just a few weeks later met with 
President Trump in New York—all 
without anyone making any statement 
about any investigations. And, once 
again, not a single witness in the 
House record that they compiled and 
developed under their procedures that 
we have discussed and will continue to 
discuss, provided any firsthand evi-
dence that the President ever linked 
the Presidential meeting to any inves-
tigations. 
The House managers have seized 
upon Ambassador Sondland’s claim 
that Mr. Giuliani’s requests were a 
quid pro quo for arranging a White 
House visit for President Zelensky. 
But, again, Ambassador Sondland was 
only guessing based on incomplete in-
formation. He testified that the Presi-
dent never told him there was any sort 
of a condition for a meeting with Presi-
dent Zelensky. Why, then, did he think 
there was one? 
In 
his 
own 
words, 
Ambassador 
Sondland said that he could only re-
peat what he heard ‘‘through Ambas-
sador Volker from Giuliani.’’ So he 
didn’t even hear from Mr. Giuliani 
himself. But Ambassador Volker, who 
is the supposed link between Mr. 
Giuliani and Ambassador Sondland, 
thought no such thing. Ambassador 
Volker testified unequivocally that 
there was no linkage between the 
meeting with President Zelensky and 
Ukrainian investigations. 
I am going to read the full questions 
and answers because this passage is 
key. This is from Ambassador Volker’s 
deposition testimony. 
Question. Did President Trump ever with-
hold a meeting with President Zelensky or 
delay a meeting with President Zelensky 
until the Ukrainians committed to inves-
tigate the allegations that you just described 
concerning the 2016 Presidential election? 
Answer. The answer to the question is no, 
if you want a yes-or-no answer. But the rea-
son the answer is no is we did have difficulty 
scheduling a meeting, but there was no link-
age like that. 
Question. You said that you were not 
aware of any linkage between delaying the 
Oval 
Office 
meeting 
between 
President 
Trump and President Zelensky and the 
Ukrainian commitment to investigate the 
two allegations as you described them, cor-
rect? 
Answer. Correct. 
Over the past week, on no fewer than 
15 separate occasions, the House man-
agers played a video of Ambassador 
Sondland saying that the announce-
ment of the investigations was a pre-
requisite for a meeting or call with the 
President—15 times. They never once 
read to you the testimony that I just 
did. They never once read to you the 
testimony in which Ambassador Volker 
refuted what Ambassador Sondland 
claimed he heard from Ambassador 
Volker. 
Here is what we know. President 
Trump invited President Zelensky to 
meet 
three 
times 
without 
pre-
conditions. The White House was work-
ing behind the scenes to schedule the 
meeting. The two Presidents planned 
to meet in Warsaw, just as President 
Zelensky had asked, and ultimately 
met 3 weeks later without Ukraine an-
nouncing any investigations. 
No one testified in the House record 
that the President ever said there was 
a connection between a meeting and in-
vestigations. Those are the facts, plain 
and simple. So much for a quid pro quo 
for a meeting with the President. 
Before I move on, let me take a brief 
moment to address a side allegation 
that was raised in the original whistle-
blower complaint and that the House 
managers are still trying to push. 
The managers claim that President 
Trump ordered Vice President PENCE 
not to attend President Zelensky’s in-
auguration in favor of a lower ranking 
delegation 
in 
order—according 
to 
them—to single a downgrading of the 
relationship between the United States 
and Ukraine. 
That is not true. As I am sure every-
one in this room can greatly appre-
ciate, numerous factors had to align 
for the VP to attend. 
First, dates of travel were limited. 
For national security reasons, the 
President and Vice President generally 
avoid being out of the country at the 
same time for more than a few hours. 
The President had scheduled trips to 
Europe and Japan during the period 
when our Embassy in Ukraine antici-
pated 
the 
Ukrainian 
inauguration 
would occur, at the end of May or in 
early June. Jennifer Williams testified 
that the Office of the Vice President 
advised the Ukrainians that, if the 
Vice President were to participate in 
the inauguration, the ideal dates would 
be around May 29, May 30, May 31, or 
June 1, when the President would be in 
the United States. She said ‘‘if it 
wasn’t one of those dates, it would be 
very difficult or impossible’’ for the 
Vice President to attend. 
Second, the House managers act as if 
no other priorities in the world could 
compete for the administration’s time. 
The Vice President’s Office was simul-
taneously planning a competing trip 
for May 30 in Ottawa, Canada, to par-
ticipate in an event supporting passage 
of the United States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement. Ultimately, the Vice Presi-
dent traveled to Ottawa on May 30 to 
meet 
with 
Prime 
Minister 
Justin 
Trudeau and to promote the passage of 
the USMCA. This decision, as you 
know, advanced the top administration 
priority and an issue President Trump 
vigorously supported. 
What you did not hear from the 
House managers was that the Ukrain-
ian inauguration dates did not go as 
planned. 
On 
May 
16—May 
16—the 
Ukrainians 
surprised 
everyone 
and 
scheduled the inauguration for just 4 
days later, on May 20—Monday, May 20. 
So think about that: May 16, May 20. 
Get everybody—security, advance, ev-
eryone—to Ukraine. Jennifer Williams 
testified that it was very short notice, 
so it would have been difficult for the 
Vice President to attend, particularly 
since they hadn’t sent out the advance 
team. 
George Kent testified that the short 
notice left almost no time for either 
proper preparations or foreign delega-
tions to visit and that the State De-
partment scrambled on Friday the 17th 
to try and figure out who was avail-
able. Mr. Kent suggested that Sec-
retary of Energy Perry be the anchor 
for the delegation, as ‘‘someone who 
was a person of stature and whose job 
had relevance to our agenda.’’ Sec-
retary Perry led the delegation, which 
also included Ambassador Sondland, 
Ambassador Volker, and Senator JOHN-
SON. Ambassador Volker testified that 
it was the largest delegation from any 
country there, and it was a high-level 
one. The House managers didn’t tell 
you this. Why not? 
The claim that the President in-
structed the Vice President not to at-
tend President Zelensky’s inauguration 
is based on House manager assump-
tions with no evidence that the Presi-
dent did something wrong. 
Finally, as I am coming to the end, if 
the evidence doesn’t show a quid pro 
quo, what does it show? Unfortunately 
for the House managers, one of the few 
things that all of the witnesses agreed 
on was that President Trump has 
strengthened the relationship between 
the United States and Ukraine and 
that he has been a more stalwart friend 
to Ukraine and a more fierce opponent 
of Russian aggression than President 
Obama. The House managers repeat-
edly claimed that President Trump 
doesn’t care about Ukraine. They are 
attributing views to President Trump 
that are contrary to his actions. More 
importantly, they are contrary to the 
House managers’ own evidence. 
But don’t take my word for it. Am-
bassadors Yovanovitch, Taylor, and 
Volker all testified to the Trump ad-
ministration’s positive new policy to-
ward 
Ukraine 
based 
especially 
on 
President Trump’s decision to provide 
lethal aid to Ukraine. Ambassador 
Taylor 
testified 
that 
President 
Trump’s policy toward Ukraine was a 
substantial improvement over Presi-
dent 
Obama’s 
policy. 
Ambassador 
Volker agreed that America’s policy 
toward Ukraine has been strengthened 
under President Trump, whom he cred-
ited with approving each of the deci-
sions made along the way. 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch 
testified 
that President Trump’s decision to pro-
vide lethal weapons to Ukraine meant 
that our policy actually got stronger 
over the last 3 years. She called the 
policy shift that President Trump di-
rected very significant. Let’s hear from 
Ambassador 
Taylor, 
Ambassador 
Volker, and Ambassador Yovanovitch.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S588 
January 27, 2020 
Ukraine in the form of defensive lethal aid, 
correct? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. That is correct. 
Ms. STEFANIK. And that is more so than 
the Obama administration, correct? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. The Trump admin-
istration— 
Ms. STEFANIK. Defensive lethal aid. 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Yes. 
Ambassador VOLKER. President Trump 
approved each of the decisions made along 
the way, providing lethal defensive equip-
ment. 
Ambassador 
YOVANOVITCH. 
And 
the 
Trump administration strengthened our pol-
icy by approving the provision to Ukraine of 
antitank missiles known as Javelins. 
They are obviously tank busters. And so, if 
the war with Russia all—all of a sudden ac-
celerated in some way and tanks come over 
the horizon, Javelins are a very serious 
weapon to deal with that. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Ukraine is 
better positioned to fight Russia today 
than it was before President Trump 
took office. As a result, the United 
States is safer too. The House man-
agers did not tell you about this testi-
mony 
from 
Ambassadors 
Taylor, 
Volker, and Yovanovitch. Why not? 
These are the facts, as drawn from 
the House managers’ own record on 
which they impeached the President. 
This is why the House managers’ first 
Article of Impeachment must fail, for 
the six reasons I set forth when I began 
on Saturday: 
There was no linkage between inves-
tigations and security assistance or a 
meeting on the July 25 call. The 
Ukrainians said there was no quid pro 
quo and they felt no pressure. The top 
Ukrainians did not even know that se-
curity assistance was paused until 
more than a month after the July 25 
call. The House managers’ record re-
flects that anyone who spoke with the 
President said that the President made 
clear that there was no linkage. The 
security assistance flowed, and the 
Presidential meeting took place, all 
without any announcement of inves-
tigations. And President Trump has en-
hanced America’s support for Ukraine 
in his 3 years in office. 
These facts all require that the first 
Article of Impeachment fail. You have 
already heard and will continue to hear 
from my colleagues on why the second 
article must fail. Once again, this is 
the case that the House managers 
chose to bring. This is the evidence 
they brought before the Senate. 
The very heavy burden of proof rests 
with them. They say their case is over-
whelming and uncontested. It is not. 
They say they have proven each of the 
articles against President Trump. They 
have not. The facts and evidence of the 
case the House managers have brought 
exonerate the President. 
Thank you for your attention. 
Mr. Chief Justice, I think we are 
ready for a break. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
colleagues, we will take a 15-minute 
break. 
There being no objection, at 2:52 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 3:17 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. It is my under-
standing that, having consulted with 
the President’s lawyers, we are looking 
at around 6 p.m. for dinner, and we will 
plow right through until 6 p.m. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
President’s 
counsel 
can 
continue 
with their case. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the 
Senate, House managers, there has 
been a lot of talk in both the briefs and 
in the discussions over the last week 
about one of our colleagues, former 
mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani. 
Mayor Giuliani served as one of the 
leaders of the President’s defense team 
during the Mueller investigation. He is 
mentioned 531 times—20 in the brief 
and about 511, give or take, in the ar-
guments, including the motion day. 
We had a robust team that worked on 
the President’s defense during the 
Mueller probe, consisting of Mayor 
Giuliani, Andrew Ekonomou, Stuart 
Roth, Jordan Sekulow, Ben Sisney, 
Mark Goldfeder, Mayor Giuliani, of 
course, and Marty Raskin, as well as 
Jane Raskin. Jane Serene Raskin was 
one of the leading attorneys on the 
Mueller investigation for the defense of 
the President. 
The issue of Mayor Giuliani has come 
up here in this Chamber a lot. We 
thought it would be appropriate now to 
turn to that issue, the role of the 
President’s lawyer, his private counsel, 
in this proceeding. I would like to yield 
my time, Mr. Chief Justice, to Jane Se-
rene Raskin. 
Ms. Counsel RASKIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, 
Majority 
Leader 
MCCONNELL, 
Members of the Senate. 
I expect you have heard American 
poet Carl Sandburg’s summary of the 
trial lawyer’s dilemma: 
If the facts are against you, argue the law. 
If the law is against you, argue the facts. If 
the facts and the law are against you, pound 
the table and yell like hell. 
Well, we have heard the House man-
agers do some table-pounding and a lit-
tle yelling, but, in the main, they have 
used a different tactic here, a tactic fa-
miliar to trial lawyers, though not 
mentioned by Mr. Sandburg. If both 
the law and the facts are against you, 
present a distraction, emphasize a sen-
sational fact or perhaps a colorful or 
controversial public figure who appears 
on the scene, then distort certain facts, 
ignore others, even when they are the 
most 
probative, 
make 
conclusory 
statements, and insinuate the shiny 
object is far more important than the 
actual facts allow; in short, divert at-
tention from the holes in your case. 
Rudy Giuliani is the House man-
agers’ colorful distraction. He is a 
household name. He is a legendary Fed-
eral prosecutor who took down the 
Mafia, corrupt public officials, Wall 
Street racketeers. He is the crime- 
busting mayor who cleaned up New 
York and turned it around, a national 
hero, America’s mayor after 9/11, and, 
after that, an internationally recog-
nized expert on fighting corruption. To 
be sure, Mr. Giuliani has always been 
somewhat of a controversial figure for 
his hard-hitting, take-no-prisoners ap-
proach, but it is no stretch to say that 
he was respected by friend and foe 
alike for his intellect, his tenacity, his 
accomplishments, and his fierce loy-
alty to his causes and his country. 
And then, the unthinkable happened. 
He publicly supported the candidacy of 
President Trump—the one who was not 
supposed to win. And then, in the 
spring of 2018, he stood up to defend the 
President—successfully, it turns out— 
against what we all now know is the 
real debunked conspiracy theory; that 
the Trump campaign colluded with 
Russia during the 2016 campaign. The 
House managers would have you be-
lieve that Mr. Giuliani is at the center 
of this controversy. They have anoint-
ed him the proxy villain of the tale, the 
leader of a rogue operation. Their pres-
entations were filled with ad hominem 
attacks and name-calling: cold-blooded 
political operative, political bagman. 
But I suggest to you that he is front 
and center in their narrative for one 
reason and one reason alone: to dis-
tract from the fact that the evidence 
does not support their claims. 
So what is the first tell that Mr. 
Giuliani’s role in this may not be all 
that it is cracked up to be? They didn’t 
subpoena him to testify. In fact, Mr. 
SCHIFF and his committee never even 
invited him to testify. They took a 
stab at subpoenaing his documents 
back in September, and when his law-
yer responded with legal defenses to 
the production, the House walked 
away. But if Rudy Giuliani is every-
thing they say he is, don’t you think 
they would have subpoenaed and pur-
sued his testimony? Ask yourselves, 
why didn’t they? 
In fact, it appears the House com-
mittee wasn’t particularly interested 
in presenting you with any direct evi-
dence of what Mayor Giuliani did or 
why he did it. Instead, they ask you to 
rely on hearsay, speculation, and as-
sumption—evidence that would be in-
admissible in any court. 
For example, the House managers 
suggest that Mr. Giuliani, at the Presi-
dent’s 
direction, 
demanded 
that 
Ukraine announce an investigation of 
the Bidens and Burisma before agree-
ing to a White House visit. They base 
that on a statement to that effect by 
Ambassador Sondland. 
But what the House managers don’t 
tell you is that Sondland admitted he 
was speculating about that. He pre-
sumed that Mr. Giuliani’s requests 
were intended as a condition for a 
White House visit. Even worse, his as-
sumption was on thirdhand informa-
tion. As he put it, the most he could do

January 27, 2020 
is repeat what he heard through Am-
bassador Volker from Giuliani, whom 
he presumed spoke to the President on 
the issue. And by the way, as Mr. Pur-
pura has explained, the person who was 
actually speaking to Mr. Giuliani, Am-
bassador Volker, testified clearly that 
there was no linkage between the 
meeting with President Zelensky and 
Ukrainian investigations. 
The House managers also make much 
of a May 23 White House meeting dur-
ing which the President suggested to 
his Ukraine working group, including 
Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, 
that they should talk to Rudy. The 
managers told you that President 
Trump gave a directive and a demand 
that the group needed to work with 
Giuliani if they wanted him to agree 
with the Ukraine policy they were pro-
posing, but those words, ‘‘directive’’ 
and ‘‘demand,’’ are misleading. They 
misrepresent what the witnesses actu-
ally said. 
Ambassador Volker testified that he 
understood, based on the meeting, that 
Giuliani 
was 
only 
one 
of 
several 
sources of information for the Presi-
dent, and the President simply wanted 
officials to speak to Mr. Giuliani be-
cause he knows all these things about 
Ukraine. As Volker put it, the Presi-
dent’s comment was not an instruction 
but 
just 
a 
comment. 
Ambassador 
Sondland agreed. He testified that he 
didn’t take it as an order, and he added 
that the President wasn’t even specific 
about what he wanted us to talk to 
Giuliani about. 
So it may come as no surprise to you 
that after the May 23 meeting, the one 
during which the House managers told 
you the President demanded that his 
Ukraine team talk to Giuliani, neither 
Volker nor Sondland even followed up 
with Mr. Giuliani until July, and the 
July followup by Mr. Volker happened 
only because the Ukrainian Govern-
ment asked to be put in touch with 
him. Volker testified that President 
Zelensky’s senior aide, Andriy Yermak, 
approached him to ask to be connected 
to Mr. Giuliani. 
House Democrats also rely on testi-
mony that Mayor Giuliani told Ambas-
sadors Volker and Sondland that, in 
his view, to be credible, a Ukrainian 
statement on anti-corruption should 
specifically 
mention 
investigations 
into 2016 election interference and 
Burisma. 
But when Ambassador Volker was 
asked whether he knew if Giuliani was 
‘‘conveying messages that President 
Trump wanted conveyed to the Ukrain-
ians,’’ Volker said that he did not have 
that 
impression. 
He 
believed 
that 
Giuliani was doing his own commu-
nication about what he believed he was 
interested in. 
But even more significant than the 
reliance on presumptions, assumptions, 
and unsupported conclusions is the 
managers’ failure to place in any fair 
context Mr. Giuliani’s actual role in 
exploring Ukrainian corruption. To 
hear their presentation, you might 
think 
that 
Mayor 
Giuliani 
had 
parachuted into the President’s orbit 
in the spring of 2019 for the express 
purpose of carrying out a political hit 
job. They would have you believe that 
Mayor Giuliani was only there to dig 
up dirt against former Vice President 
Biden because he might be President 
Trump’s rival in the 2020 election. 
Of course, Mr. Giuliani’s intent is no 
small matter here. It is a central and 
essential premise of the House man-
agers’ case that Mr. Giuliani’s motive 
in investigating Ukrainian corruption 
and interference in the 2016 election 
was an entirely political one, under-
taken at the President’s direction. But 
what evidence have the managers actu-
ally offered you to support that propo-
sition? On close inspection, it turns out 
virtually none. They just say it over 
and over and over. 
And they offer you another false di-
chotomy. Either Mr. Giuliani was act-
ing in an official capacity to further 
the President’s foreign policy objec-
tives or he was acting as the Presi-
dent’s personal attorney, in which 
case, they conclude, ipse dixit, his mo-
tive would only be to further the Presi-
dent’s political objectives. 
The House managers then point to 
various of Mr. Giuliani’s public state-
ments in which he is clear and com-
pletely transparent about the fact that 
he is, indeed, the President’s personal 
attorney. There you have it. Giuliani 
admits he is acting as the President’s 
personal attorney, and therefore he had 
to have been acting with a political 
motive to influence the 2020 election. 
No other option, right? Wrong. There 
is, of course, another obvious answer to 
the question, what motivated Mayor 
Giuliani to investigate the possible in-
volvement of Ukrainians in the 2016 
election? The House managers know 
what the answer is. It is in plain sight, 
and Mr. Giuliani has told any number 
of news outlets exactly when and why 
he became interested in the issue. 
It had nothing to do with the 2020 
election. Mayor Giuliani began inves-
tigating Ukraine corruption and inter-
ference in the 2020 election way back in 
November of 2018—a full 6 months be-
fore Vice President Biden announced 
his candidacy and 4 months before the 
release of the Mueller report, when the 
biggest false conspiracy theory in cir-
culation that the Trump campaign had 
colluded with Russia during the 2016 
campaign was still in wide circulation. 
As The Hill reported: ‘‘As President 
Trump’s highest profile defense attor-
ney, the former New York City mayor, 
often known simply as ‘Rudy,’ believed 
the Ukrainians’ evidence could assist 
in his defense against the Russia collu-
sion investigation and former Special 
Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report.’’ 
So Giuliani began to check things 
out in late 2018 and early 2019. 
The genesis of Mayor Giuliani’s in-
vestigation was also reported by nu-
merous other media outlets, including 
CNN, which related that Giuliani’s role 
in Ukraine could be traced back to No-
vember 2018, when he was contacted by 
someone he describes as a well-known 
investigator. The Washington Post and 
many other news outlets reported the 
same information. 
So, yes, Mayor Giuliani was Presi-
dent Trump’s personal attorney, but he 
was not on a political errand. As he has 
stated repeatedly and publicly, he was 
doing what good defense attorneys do. 
He was following a lead from a well- 
known private investigator. He was 
gathering evidence regarding Ukrain-
ian election interference to defend his 
client against the false allegations 
being investigated by Special Counsel 
Mueller, but the House managers didn’t 
even allude to that possibility. Instead, 
they just repeated their mantra that 
Giuliani’s motive was purely political. 
That speaks volumes about the bias 
with which they have approached their 
mission. 
The bottom line is, Mr. Giuliani de-
fended President Trump vigorously, re-
lentlessly, and publicly throughout the 
Mueller investigation and in the non-
stop congressional investigations that 
followed, 
including 
the 
attempted 
Mueller redo by the House Judiciary 
Committee, which the managers would 
apparently like to sneak in the back 
door here. 
The House managers may not like his 
style—you may not like his style—but 
one might argue that he is everything 
Clarence Darrow said a defense lawyer 
must be—outrageous, irreverent, blas-
phemous, a rogue, a renegade. The fact 
is, in the end, after a 2-year siege on 
the Presidency, two inspector general 
reports, and a $32 million special coun-
sel investigation, it turns out Rudy 
was spot-on. 
It seems to me we are keeping score 
on who got it right on allegations of 
FISA abuse, egregious misconduct at 
the highest level of the FBI, alleged 
collusion between the Trump campaign 
and Russia, and supposed obstruction 
of justice in connection with the spe-
cial counsel’s investigation. The score 
is Mayor Giuliani 4, Mr. SCHIFF 0. But 
in this trial, in this moment, Mr. 
Giuliani is just a minor player—that 
shiny object designed to distract you. 
Senators, I urge you most respect-
fully: Do not be distracted. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
I yield back to Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, and 
House managers, we are going to now 
move to a section dealing with the law. 
There are two issues in particular that 
my colleague Pat Philbin, the Deputy 
White House Counsel, will be address-
ing, issues involving due process and 
legal issues specifically dealing with 
the second Article of Impeachment: 
Obstruction of Congress. So I yield my 
time now, Mr. Chief Justice, to Mr. 
Philbin. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice,

tation, I touched on two areas: some of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S590 
January 27, 2020 
the due process violations that charac-
terized the proceedings in the House 
and 
some 
of 
the 
fundamental 
mischaracterizations and errors that 
underpinned 
the 
House 
Democrats’ 
charge for obstruction. I will complete 
the presentation today on those points 
to round out some of the fundamen-
tally unfair procedures that were used 
in the House and their implications in 
this proceeding before you now and 
also address in detail the purported 
charges of obstruction in the second 
Article of Impeachment. 
On due process, there are three fun-
damental errors that affected the pro-
ceedings in the House. The first is, as I 
explained on Saturday, the impeach-
ment inquiry was unauthorized and un-
constitutional from the beginning. 
No committee of the House has the 
power to launch an inquiry under the 
House’s impeachment power unless the 
House itself has taken a vote to give 
that authority to a committee. I noted 
that, in cases such as Rumely v. United 
States and United States v. Watkins, 
the Supreme Court has set out these 
principles, general principles derived 
from the Constitution, which assign 
authority to each Chamber of the legis-
lative branch—to the House and to the 
Senate—but not to individual members 
or to subcommittees. For an authority 
of the House to be transferred to a 
committee, the House has to vote on 
that. 
The DC Circuit has distilled the prin-
ciples from those cases this way: ‘‘To 
issue a valid subpoena, a committee or 
a subcommittee must conform strictly 
to the resolution establishing its inves-
tigatory powers.’’ That was the prob-
lem here in that there was no such res-
olution. There was no vote from the 
House authorizing the issuance of sub-
poenas under the impeachment power. 
So this inquiry began with nearly two 
dozen invalid subpoenas. The Speaker 
had the House proceed on nothing more 
than a press conference in which she 
purported to authorize committees to 
begin an impeachment power. Under 
the Constitution, she lacked that au-
thority. 
As the chairman of the House Judici-
ary Committee, Peter Rodino, pointed 
out during the Nixon impeachment in-
quiry: 
Such a resolution [from the House] has al-
ways been passed by the House. . . . It is a 
necessary step if we are to meet our obliga-
tion. 
So we began this process with unau-
thorized subpoenas that imposed no 
compulsion on the executive branch to 
respond with documents or witnesses. I 
will be coming back to that point, that 
threshold foundational point, when we 
get to the obstruction charge. 
The second fundamental due process 
error is that the House Democrats de-
nied the President basic due process re-
quired by the Constitution and by the 
fundamental principles of fairness in 
the procedures that they used for the 
hearings. I am not going to go back in 
detail over those. As we heard from 
Judge Starr, the House Democrats es-
sentially abandoned the principles that 
have governed impeachment inquiries 
in the House for over 150 years. I will 
touch on just a few points and respond 
to a couple of points that the House 
managers have made. 
The first is that, in denying due proc-
ess rights, the House proceedings were 
a huge reversal from the positions the 
House 
Democrats 
themselves 
had 
taken in the recent past, particularly 
in 
the 
Clinton 
impeachment 
pro-
ceeding. 
I believe we have Manager NADLER’s 
description of what was required. Per-
haps not. Manager NADLER
was ex-
plaining that due process requires at a 
minimum notice of the charges against 
you, the right to be represented by 
counsel, the right to cross-examine 
witnesses against you, and the right to 
present evidence. All of those rights 
were denied to the President. 
Now, one of the responses that the 
managers have made to the defect that 
we pointed out in the secret pro-
ceedings, where Manager SCHIFF began 
these hearings in the basement bunker, 
is that, well, that was really just best 
investigative practice; they were oper-
ating like a grand jury. Don’t be fooled 
by that. Those hearings operated noth-
ing like a grand jury. 
A grand jury has secrecy primarily 
for two reasons: to protect the direc-
tion of the investigation so others 
won’t know what witnesses are being 
called in and what they are saying—to 
keep that secret for the prosecutor to 
be able to keep developing the evi-
dence—and to protect the accused be-
cause the accused might not ever be in-
dicted. 
In this case, all of that information 
was made public every day. The House 
Democrats destroyed any legitimate 
analogy to a grand jury, because that 
was all public. They made no secret 
that the President was the target. 
They issued vile calumnies about him 
every day. They didn’t keep the direc-
tion of their investigation secret. Their 
witness lists were published daily, and 
the direction of the investigation was 
open. The testimony that took place 
was selectively leaked to a compliant 
media to establish a false narrative 
about the President. 
If that sort of conduct had occurred 
in a real grand jury, that would have 
been a criminal violation. Prosecutors 
can’t do that. Under rule 6(e) of the 
Federal criminal rules, it is a criminal 
offense to be leaking what takes place 
in a grand jury. 
Also, the grand jury explanation pro-
vides no rationale whatsoever for this 
second round of hearings. Remember, 
after the basement bunker—after the 
secret hearings where the testimony 
was prescreened—then the same wit-
nesses who had already been deposed 
were put on in a public hearing where 
the President was still excluded. 
Ask yourself, what was the reason for 
that? In every prior Presidential im-
peachment in the modern era where 
there have been public hearings, the 
President has been represented by 
counsel and could cross-examine wit-
nesses. Why did there have to be pub-
lic, televised hearings where the Presi-
dent was excluded? That was nothing 
more than a show trial. 
I also addressed the other day the 
House managers’ contention that they 
had offered the President due process; 
that when things reached the third 
round of hearings in front of the House 
Judiciary Committee, Manager NADLER 
offered the President due process. I ex-
plained why that was illusory. There 
was no genuine offer there because, be-
fore any hearings began, other than the 
law professor’s seminar on December 4, 
the Speaker had already determined 
the outcome, had already said there 
were going to be Articles of Impeach-
ment, and the Judiciary Committee 
had informed the counsel’s office that 
they had no plans to call any fact wit-
nesses or have any factual hearings 
whatsoever. It was all done. It was 
locked in. It was baked. 
There was something else hanging 
over that when they had purportedly 
offered to allow the President some due 
process rights, and that was a special 
provision in the rules for the House Ju-
diciary Committee proceedings—also 
unprecedented—that allowed the House 
Judiciary 
Committee 
to 
deny 
the 
President any due process rights at all 
if he continued to refuse to turn over 
documents or not allow witnesses to 
testify, so that if the President didn’t 
give up his privileges and immunities 
that he had been asserting over execu-
tive 
branch 
confidentiality—if 
he 
didn’t comply with what the House 
Democrats wanted—then it was up to 
Chairman NADLER, potentially, to say: 
No rights at all. There is a term for 
that in the law. It is called an uncon-
stitutional condition. You can’t condi-
tion someone’s exercise of some rights 
on his surrendering other constitu-
tional rights. You can’t say: We will let 
you have due process in this way if you 
waive your constitutional privilege on 
another issue. 
The last point I will make about due 
process is this: It is important to re-
member that due process is enshrined 
in the Bill of Rights for a reason. It is 
not that process is just an end in itself. 
Instead, it is a deep-seated belief in our 
legal tradition that fair process is es-
sential for accurate decision making. 
Cross-examination of witnesses, in 
particular, is one of the most impor-
tant procedural protections for any 
American. The Supreme Court has ex-
plained that, for over 250 years, our 
legal tradition has recognized cross-ex-
amination as the greatest legal engine 
ever invented for the discovery of 
truth. 
So why do House Democrats jettison 
every precedent and every principle of 
due process in the way they devise 
these hearing procedures? Why did 
they devise a process that kept the 
President blocked out of any hearings 
for 71 of the 78 days of the so-called in-
vestigation?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S591 
January 27, 2020 
I would submit because their process 
was never about finding truth. Their 
process was about achieving a predeter-
mined outcome on a timetable and 
having it done by Christmas, and that 
is what they achieved. 
Now, the third fundamental due proc-
ess error is that the whole foundation 
of these proceedings was also tainted 
beyond repair because an interested 
fact witness supervised and limited the 
course of the factual discovery, the 
course of the hearings. I explained the 
other day that Manager SCHIFF had a 
reason, potentially, because of his of-
fice’s contact with the so-called whis-
tleblower and what was discussed and 
how the complaint was framed, which 
all remained secret, to limit inquiry 
into that, which is relevant. 
The whistleblower began this whole 
process. His bias, his motive, why he 
was doing it, what his sources were— 
that is relevant to understand what 
generated this whole process, but there 
was no inquiry into that. 
So what conclusion does this all lead 
to—all of these due process errors that 
have infected the proceeding up to 
now? 
I think it is important to recognize 
the right conclusion is not that this 
body, this Chamber, should try to redo 
everything—to start bringing in new 
evidence, bring in witnesses because 
the President wasn’t allowed witnesses 
below and redo the whole process. And 
that is for a couple of reasons. 
One is, first, as my colleagues have 
demonstrated, despite the one-sided, 
unfair process in the House, the record 
that the House Democrats collected 
through that process already shows 
that the President did nothing wrong. 
It already exonerates the President. 
But the second and more important 
reason is because of the institutional 
implications it would have for this 
Chamber. Whatever precedent is set, 
whatever this body accepts now as a 
permissible way to bring an impeach-
ment proceeding and to bring it to this 
Chamber becomes the new normal. And 
if the new normal is going to be that 
there can be an impeachment pro-
ceeding in the House that violates due 
process, that doesn’t provide the Presi-
dent or another official being im-
peached due process rights, that fails 
to conduct a thorough investigation, 
that doesn’t come here with facts es-
tablished, that then this body should 
become the investigatory body and 
start redoing what the House didn’t do 
and finding new witnesses and doing 
things over and getting new evidence, 
then, that is going to be the new nor-
mal, and that will be the way that this 
Chamber has to function, and there 
will be a lot more impeachments com-
ing because it is a lot easier to do an 
impeachment if you don’t have to fol-
low due process and then come here 
and expect the Senate to do the work 
that the House didn’t do. 
I submit that is not the constitu-
tional function of this Chamber sitting 
as a Court of Impeachment, and this 
Chamber should not put its imprimatur 
on a process in the House that would 
force this Chamber to take on that 
role. 
Now, I will move on to the charge of 
obstruction in the second Article of 
Impeachment. 
Accepting that Article of Impeach-
ment would fundamentally damage 
separation of powers under the Con-
stitution by permanently altering the 
relationship between the executive and 
the legislative branches. In the second 
article, House Democrats are trying to 
impeach the President for resisting le-
gally defective demands for informa-
tion by asserting established legal de-
fenses and immunities based on legal 
advice from the Department of Jus-
tice’s Office of Legal Counsel. In es-
sence, the approach here is that House 
Democrats are saying: When we de-
mand documents, the executive branch 
must comply immediately, and the as-
sertions of privilege or defenses to our 
subpoenas are further evidence of ob-
struction. We don’t have to go through 
the constitutionally mandated accom-
modations process to work out an ac-
ceptable solution with the executive 
branch. We don’t have to go to the 
courts to establish the validity of our 
subpoenas. 
At one point, Manager SCHIFF said 
that anything that makes the House 
even contemplate litigation is evidence 
of obstruction. Instead, the House 
claims it can jump straight to im-
peachment. 
What this really means, in this case, 
is that they are saying for the Presi-
dent to defend the prerogatives of his 
office, to defend the constitutionally 
grounded 
principles 
of 
executive 
branch privileges of immunities is an 
impeachable offense. 
If this Chamber accepts that premise, 
that what has been asserted here con-
stitutes an impeachable offense, it will 
forever damage the separation of pow-
ers. It will undermine the independence 
of the executive and destroy the 
bounds between the legislative and ex-
ecutive branches that the Framers 
crafted in the Constitution. 
As Professor Turley testified before 
the House Judiciary Committee, ‘‘bas-
ing impeachment on this obstruction 
theory would itself be an abuse of 
power . . . by Congress.’’ 
And I would like to go through that 
and unpack and explain something. I 
will start by outlining what the Trump 
administration actually did in response 
to subpoenas, because there are three 
different actions—three different le-
gally based assertions for resisting dif-
ferent subpoenas that the Trump ad-
ministration made. 
I pointed out on Saturday that there 
has been this constant refrain from the 
House Democrats that there was just 
blanket defiance, blanket obstruction, 
as if it were unexplained obstruction— 
just, we won’t cooperate with that war-
rant. And that is not true. There were 
very specific legal grounds provided, 
and each one was supported by an opin-
ion from the Department of Justice’s 
Office of Legal Counsel. 
So the first is executive branch offi-
cials declined to comply with sub-
poenas that had not been authorized, 
and that is the point I made at the be-
ginning. There was no vote from the 
House. Without a vote from the House, 
the subpoenas that were issued were 
not authorized. And I pointed out that 
in an October 18 letter from White 
House Counsel that specific ground was 
explained. 
And it wasn’t just from the White 
House counsel. There were other let-
ters. On the screen now is an October 15 
letter from OMB, which explains: 
Absent a delegation by a House rule or a 
resolution of the House, none of your com-
mittees have been delegated jurisdiction to 
conduct an investigation pursuant to the im-
peachment power under article I, section 2 of 
the Constitution. 
The letter went on to explain that 
legal rationale—not blanket defiance. 
There were specific exchanges of let-
ters explaining these legal grounds for 
resisting. 
The second ground, the second prin-
ciple that the Trump administration 
asserted was that some of these sub-
poenas purported to require the Presi-
dent’s senior advisers, his close advis-
ers, to testify. 
Following at least 50 years of prece-
dent, the Department of Justice’s Of-
fice of Legal Counsel advised that 
three senior advisers to the President— 
the Acting White House Chief of Staff, 
the Legal Advisor to the National Se-
curity Council, and the Deputy Na-
tional Security Advisor—were abso-
lutely immune from compelled con-
gressional testimony. And based on 
that advice from the Office of Legal 
Counsel, the President directed those 
advisers not to testify. 
Administrations of both political 
parties have asserted this immunity 
since the 1970s. President Obama as-
serted it as to the Director of the Of-
fice of Political Strategy and Out-
reach. President George W. Bush as-
serted it as to his former counsel and 
to his White House Chief of Staff. 
President Clinton asserted it as to two 
of his counsel. President Reagan as-
serted it as to his counsel, Fred Field-
ing, and President Nixon asserted it. 
This is not something that was just 
made up recently. There is a decades- 
long history of the Department of Jus-
tice providing the opinion that senior 
advisers to the President are immune 
from compelled congressional testi-
mony, and it is the same principle that 
was asserted here. 
There are important rationales be-
hind this immunity. One is that the 
President’s most senior advisers are es-
sentially his alter egos, and allowing 
Congress to subpoena them and compel 
them to come testify would be tanta-
mount to allowing Congress to sub-
poena the President and force him to 
come testify, but that in separation of 
powers would not be tolerated. Con-
gress could no more do that with the

President than the President could 
force Members of Congress to come to 
the White House and answer to him. 
There is also a second and important 
rationale behind this immunity, and 
that relates to executive privilege. The 
immunity protects the same interests 
that underlie executive privilege. The 
Supreme Court has recognized execu-
tive privilege that protects the con-
fidentiality of the communications 
with the President and deliberations 
within his executive branch. As the 
Court put it in United States v. Nixon, 
‘‘The privilege is fundamental to the 
operation of government and inex-
tricably rooted in the separation of 
powers under the Constitution.’’ 
So the Supreme Court has recognized 
the executive needs this privilege to be 
able to function. It is rooted in the sep-
aration of powers. 
As Attorney General Janet Reno ad-
vised President Clinton, ‘‘immunity 
such advisers enjoy from testimonial 
compulsion by a congressional com-
mittee is absolute and may not be 
overborne by competing congressional 
interests.’’ 
So that is Attorney General Janet 
Reno advising President Clinton. This 
is not a partisan issue. This is not a 
Republican or Democrat issue. Admin-
istrations of both parties have asserted 
this principle of immunity for senior 
advisers. 
And why does it matter? It matters 
because the Supreme Court has ex-
plained that the fundamental principle 
behind executive privilege is that it is 
necessary to have confidentiality in 
communications and deliberations in 
order to have good and worthwhile de-
liberations, in order to have people pro-
vide their candid advice to the Presi-
dent. Because if they knew that what 
they were going to say was going to be 
on the front page of the Washington 
Post the next day or the next week, 
they wouldn’t tell the President what 
they actually thought. If you want to 
have good decision making, there has 
to be that zone of confidentiality. 
This is the way the Supreme Court 
put it: ‘‘Human experience teaches that 
those who expect public dissemination 
of their remarks may well temper can-
dor with a concern for appearances and 
for their own interests to the det-
riment of the decision-making proc-
ess.’’ 
That was also from United States v. 
Nixon. 
So those are exactly the interests 
that are protected by having senior ad-
visers to the President be immune from 
compelled 
congressional 
testimony. 
Because once someone is compelled to 
sit in the witness seat and start an-
swering questions, it is very hard for 
them to protect that privilege, to make 
sure that they don’t start revealing 
something that was discussed. 
So for a small circle of those close to 
the President, for the past 40 to 50 
years, administrations of both parties 
have insisted on this principle. 
Now, the other night, House man-
agers, when we were here very late last 
week, suggested that executive privi-
lege was a distraction, and Manager 
NADLER called it ‘‘nonsense.’’ 
Not at all—it is a principle recog-
nized by the Supreme Court—a con-
stitutional principle grounded in sepa-
ration of powers. 
They also asserted that this immu-
nity has been rejected by every court 
that has addressed it, as if to make it 
seem that lots of courts have addressed 
this. They have all said that this the-
ory just doesn’t fly. That is not accu-
rate. That is not true. 
In fact, in most instances, once the 
President asserts immunity for a sen-
ior adviser, the accommodations proc-
ess between the executive branch and 
the legislature begins, and there is usu-
ally some compromise to allow, per-
haps, some testimony, not in open 
hearing but in a closed hearing or a 
deposition, perhaps to provide some 
other information instead of live testi-
mony. There is a compromise. 
But in the only two times it has been 
litigated, district courts, it is true, re-
jected the immunity. One was in a case 
involving former counsel to George W. 
Bush, Harriet Miers. The district court 
rejected the immunity, but imme-
diately on appeal, the Court of Appeals 
of the DC Circuit stayed that decision. 
And that decision means—to stay that 
district court decision—that the appel-
late court thought there was a likeli-
hood of success on appeal, that the ex-
ecutive branch might succeed, or, at a 
minimum, that the issue of immunity 
presented ‘‘questions going to the mer-
its so serious, substantial, difficult, 
and doubtful as to make them a fair 
ground for litigation.’’ The first deci-
sion was stayed. 
The second district court decision is 
still being litigated right now. It is the 
McGahn case that the House has 
brought, trying to get testimony from 
former counsel to President Trump, 
Donald McGahn. That case was just ar-
gued in the DC Circuit on January 3. 
So there is no established law sug-
gesting that this immunity somehow 
has been rejected by the court. It is 
still being litigated right now. It is an 
immunity that is a standard principle 
asserted by every administration in 
both parties for the past 40 years. As-
serting that principle cannot be treat-
ed as obstruction of Congress. 
The third action that the President 
took—the 
administration 
took—re-
lated to the fact that House Demo-
crats’ subpoenas tried to shut out exec-
utive branch counsel, agency counsel 
from 
the 
depositions 
of 
executive 
branch employees. Now, the Office of 
Legal Counsel concluded that congres-
sional committees may not bar agency 
counsel from assisting an executive 
branch witness without contravening 
the legitimate prerogatives of the exec-
utive branch and that attempting to 
enforce a subpoena while barring agen-
cy 
counsel 
would 
be 
‘‘unconstitu-
tional.’’ 
The President relied on that legal ad-
vice here. As Judge Starr pointed out, 
the President was consulting with the 
Department of Justice, receiving ad-
vice from the very respected Office of 
Legal Counsel, and following that ad-
vice about the constitutional preroga-
tives of his office and the constitu-
tional prerogatives of the executive 
branch. Again, administrations of both 
political parties have recognized the 
important role that agency counsel 
plays. 
In the Obama administration, the Of-
fice of Legal Counsel stated that the 
exclusion of agency counsel ‘‘could po-
tentially undermine . . . the Presi-
dent’s constitutional authority to con-
sider and assert executive privilege 
where appropriate.’’ 
So why is agency counsel important? 
As I tried to explain, the executive 
privilege of confidentiality for commu-
nications with the President for inter-
nal deliberative communications of the 
executive branch—those are important 
legal rights. They are necessary for the 
proper functioning of the executive 
branch, and the agency counsel is es-
sential to protect those legal rights. 
When an individual employee goes in 
to testify, he or she might not know— 
probably would not know—where is the 
line for what is covered by executive 
privilege or deliberative process privi-
lege—not things the employees nec-
essarily know, and their personal coun-
sel, even if they are permitted to have 
their personal counsel with them— 
same thing. Most personal attorneys 
for employees don’t know the finer 
points of executive branch confiden-
tiality interests or deliberative process 
privilege. It is also not their job to pro-
tect those interests. They are the per-
sonal lawyer for the employee who is 
testifying, trying to protect that em-
ployee 
from 
potential 
legal 
con-
sequences. 
We usually have lawyers to protect 
legal rights, so it makes sense when 
there is an important legal and con-
stitutionally based right at stake—the 
executive privilege—that there should 
be a lawyer there to protect that right 
for the executive branch, and that is 
the principle that the Office of Legal 
Counsel enjoys. 
This also doesn’t raise any insur-
mountable problems for congressional 
investigations for finding information. 
In fact, just as recently as April of 2019, 
the House Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform reached an accom-
modation with the Trump administra-
tion after the administration had de-
clined to make someone available for a 
deposition because of the lack of agen-
cy counsel. That issue was worked out 
and accommodation was made, and 
there was some testimony provided in 
other circumstances. So it doesn’t al-
ways result in the kind of escalation 
that was seen here—straight to im-
peachment. The accommodation proc-
ess can work things out. 
House Democrats have pointed to a 
House rule that excludes agency coun-
sel, but, of course, that House rule can-
not override a constitutional privilege.

January 27, 2020 
So those are the three principles that 
the Trump administration asserted. 
Now I would like to turn to the claim 
that somehow the assertion of these 
principles created an impeachable of-
fense. 
The idea that asserting defenses and 
immunity—legal defenses and immu-
nity in response to subpoenas, acting 
on advice of the Department of Jus-
tice—is an impeachable offense is ab-
surd and is dangerous for our govern-
ment. Let me explain why. 
House Democrats’ obstruction theory 
is wrong first and foremost because, in 
a government of laws, asserting privi-
leges and rights to resist compulsion is 
not obstruction; it is a fundamental 
right. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, the 
Supreme Court explains that to ‘‘pun-
ish a person because he has done what 
the law plainly allows him to do is a 
due process violation of the most basic 
sort, and for an agent of the State to 
pursue a course of action whose objec-
tive is to penalize a person’s reliance 
on his legal rights is patently unconsti-
tutional.’’ 
This is a principle that in the past, in 
the Clinton impeachment, was recog-
nized across the board, that it would be 
improper to suggest that asserting 
rights is an impeachable offense. Har-
vard law professor Laurence Tribe said: 
‘‘The allegation that invoking privi-
leges and otherwise using the judicial 
system to shield information . . . is an 
abuse of power that should lead to im-
peachment and removal from office is 
not only frivolous, but also dan-
gerous.’’ 
Manager NADLER said that the use of 
a legal privilege is not illegal or im-
peachable itself—a legal privilege, ex-
ecutive 
privilege. 
Minority 
Leader 
SCHUMER, in the Clinton impeachment, 
expressed the same view: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. SCHUMER. To suggest that any sub-
ject of an investigation, much less the Presi-
dent with obligations to the institution of 
the presidency, is abusing power and inter-
fering with an investigation by making le-
gitimate legal claims, using due process and 
asserting constitutional rights, is beyond se-
rious consideration. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. That was ex-
actly correct then and it is exactly cor-
rect now. 
More important than simply the 
principle that asserting rights can’t be 
considered 
obstruction, 
when 
the 
rights the President has asserted are 
based on executive privilege, when they 
are constitutionally grounded prin-
ciples that are essential for the separa-
tion of powers and for protecting the 
institution of the Office of the Presi-
dency, to call that obstruction is to 
turn the Constitution on its head. De-
fending the separation of powers can-
not be deemed an impeachable offense 
without destroying the Constitution. 
Accepting that approach would do per-
manent damage to the separation of 
powers and would allow the House of 
Representatives to turn any disagree-
ment with the Executive over informa-
tional demands into a supposed basis 
for removing the President from office. 
It would effectively create for us the 
very parliamentary system that the 
Framers sought to avoid because, by 
making any demand for information 
and goading the Executive to a refusal 
and treating that, then, as impeach-
able, the House would effectively be 
able to function with a no-confidence 
vote power. That is not the Framers’ 
design. The legislative and executive 
branches frequently clash on questions 
of constitutional interpretation, in-
cluding about congressional demands 
for information. These conflicts have 
happened since the founding. 
In 1796, George Washington, our first 
President, resisted demands from Con-
gress for information about the nego-
tiation of the Jay Treaty, and there 
have been conflicts between the Execu-
tive and the Congress in virtually 
every administration since then about 
congressional demands for informa-
tion. 
The Founding Fathers expected the 
branches to have these conflicts. James 
Madison pointed out that ‘‘the legisla-
tive, executive, and judicial depart-
ments . . . must, in the exercise of its 
functions, be guided by the text of the 
Constitution according to its own in-
terpretation of it.’’ It was recognized 
that there would be friction. 
Similarly in Federalist 51, Madison 
pointed out that ‘‘the great security 
against a gradual concentration of the 
several powers in the same department 
consists in giving to those who admin-
ister each department the necessary 
constitutional means and personal mo-
tives to resist encroachment of the 
others.’’ This is checks and balances, 
this friction, this clashing between the 
branches. It is not evidence of an im-
peachable offense. It is the separation 
of powers in its practical operation. It 
is part of the constitutional design. 
Now, the proper and historically ac-
cepted way that these disagreements 
have been resolved is through the con-
stitutionally 
mandated 
accommoda-
tions process. Courts have explained 
that the branches are required to en-
gage in an accommodation process to 
resolve disagreements where there is a 
clash over a demand for information. 
As the DC Circuit has explained, when 
Congress asks for information from the 
executive branch that triggers ‘‘an im-
plicit constitutional mandate to seek 
optimal accommodation . . . of the 
needs of the conflicting branches,’’ the 
goal is to accommodate the needs of 
both branches to reach a compromise. 
If that accommodation process fails, 
Congress has other tools at its disposal 
to 
address 
the 
disagreement. 
The 
House traditionally has proceeded to 
contempt—to vote on a contempt reso-
lution. In recent times, the House has 
taken the position that it may sue in 
the courts to determine the validity of 
its subpoenas and secure an injunction 
to enforce them. 
The House managers have pointed 
out that the Trump administration, 
when sued in the McGahn case, has 
taken the view that those cases are not 
justiciable in article III courts. That is 
correct. That is the view of the Trump 
administration; that was the view of 
the Obama administration. So there is 
that resistance in the court cases to 
the jurisdiction of the courts to ad-
dress those. But the House managers 
are missing the point when they iden-
tify that position that the administra-
tion has taken because the House can-
not claim that they have a mechanism 
for going to court—they are in court 
right now asserting that mechanism in 
the McGahn case and simultaneously 
saying that, well, they don’t have to 
bother with that mechanism; they can 
jump to impeachment. 
Impeachment under the Constitution 
is the thermonuclear weapon of inter-
branch friction, and where there is 
something like a rifle or a bazooka at 
the House’s disposal to address some 
friction with the executive branch, 
that 
is 
the 
next 
step. 
It 
is 
incrementalism in the Constitution— 
not 
jumping 
straight 
to 
impeach-
ment—that is the solution. 
If the House could jump straight to 
impeachment, that would alter the re-
lationship between the branches. It 
would suggest that the House could 
make itself superior over the Executive 
to dangle the threat of impeachment 
over any demand for information made 
to the Executive. 
That is contrary to the Framers’ 
plan. Madison explained that where the 
executive 
and 
legislative 
branches 
come into conflict, in Federalist No. 49, 
‘‘[neither] of them, it is evident, can 
pretend to exclusive or superior right 
of settling the batteries between their 
respective powers.’’ But that is exactly 
what the House managers have as-
serted in this case. They have said that 
the House becomes supreme. There is 
no need for them to go to court. The 
Executive must be wrong. Any resist-
ance to their subpoena is obstruction. 
If you claim that our subpoena is in-
valid, we don’t have to do anything to 
address that concern; we will just im-
peach you because resistance is ob-
struction of Congress. 
The House put it this way in their re-
port to the Judiciary Committee. They 
effectively said that the House is the 
judge of its own powers, because what 
they said was ‘‘the Constitution gives 
the House the final word.’’ That is on 
page 154 of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee report. 
What that is essentially saying—they 
point to the fact that article I, section 
2, gives the House ‘‘the sole Power of 
Impeachment,’’ and they claim because 
it has the sole power of impeachment, 
the courts have no role; the House is 
the final word; it is the judge of its own 
powers. But that is contrary to con-
stitutional design. There is no power 
that is unchecked in the Constitution. 
The sole power of impeachment given 
to the House simply means that power 
is given solely to the House, not any-
where else.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S594 
January 27, 2020 
The Constitution does not say that 
the power of impeachment is the para-
mount power that makes all other con-
stitutional rights and privileges and 
prerogatives of the other branches fall 
away. 
The Framers recognized that there 
could be partisan impeachments and 
there could be impeachments for the 
wrong reasons, and they did not strip 
the executive branch of any of its needs 
for protecting its own sphere of author-
ity and its own prerogatives under the 
Constitution. Those principles of exec-
utive privilege and those immunities 
still survive, even in the context of im-
peachment. 
The power of impeachment is not 
like the House can simply flip a switch 
and say now we are in impeachment, 
and 
they 
have 
constitutional 
kryptonite that makes the powers of 
the executive eliminated. So when 
there are these conflicts, even in the 
context of impeachment inquiry, the 
executive can continue to assert its 
privileges and prerogatives under the 
Constitution, and, indeed, it must in 
order to protect the institutional inter-
ests of the Office of the Presidency and 
to preserve the proper balance between 
the branches under the Constitution. 
Professor Turley, rightly, pointed 
out that by claiming Congress can de-
mand any testimony or documents and 
impeach any President who dares to go 
to the courts, House Democrats were 
advancing a position that was ‘‘en-
tirely untenable and abusive of im-
peachment.’’ Other scholars agree. 
In the Clinton impeachment, Pro-
fessor Susan Low Bloch testified that 
‘‘impeaching a President for invoking 
lawful privileges is a dangerous and 
ominous precedent.’’ It would achieve 
exactly the result that Gouverneur 
Morris, one of the Framers, warned 
against at the Constitutional Conven-
tion. He explained that ‘‘when we make 
him [referring to the President] ame-
nable to Justice however we should 
take care to provide some mode that 
will not make him dependent on the 
Legislature.’’ 
That is exactly what this Article of 
Impeachment would do. It would make 
the President dependent on the legisla-
tion because any demand for informa-
tion, be it by Congress, could be used 
as a threat of impeachment to enforce 
compliance by the executive. The very 
theory that the House Democrats have 
asserted is that there can be no asser-
tions of privileges and no constitu-
tionally based prerogatives of the Ex-
ecutive to stand in the way. 
If that theory were true, virtually 
every President could have been im-
peached. Virtually every President has 
asserted, at one time or another, these 
constitutional prerogatives. President 
Obama famously, in the Fast and Furi-
ous investigation, refused to turn over 
documents that led to his Attorney 
General being held in contempt, but 
that didn’t lead to impeachment. It 
could be a long list. Professor Turley 
testified there could be a very long list 
of Presidents who would have to be dis-
tinguished if the principles being as-
serted now in this case were applied to 
all past Presidents in history. 
Now, House Democrats have given a 
few different justifications for this ap-
proach, but I submit none can be rec-
onciled with the Constitution. They 
say that if we cannot impeach the 
President for this obstruction, then the 
President is above the law. Not so. I 
think I pointed out that the President 
is staying within the law, asserting the 
law, and relying on the legal advice 
from the Department of Justice to 
make his arguments based on long-rec-
ognized constitutional principles, and, 
indeed, is making the fundamental 
point, with respect to the subpoenas, 
that it is Congress that is not above 
the law. It is the House. The House has 
to follow the law as well. It has to 
issue valid subpoenas. And if the law 
isn’t followed, those subpoenas are null 
and void, and the Executive doesn’t 
have to comply with them. 
The House Democrats say that they 
shouldn’t go to the courts because the 
courts have no role in impeachment. I 
think I pointed out that the House 
Democrats can’t say that they have 
the—just because of the provision of 
the sole power of impeachment, that it 
is a paramount power, and that no 
other branch plays any role in pro-
viding a check on how the power is ex-
ercised. And in addition, the House 
Democrats have gone to court. 
In the McGahn case that they are 
litigating right now, they have as-
serted that is part of the impeachment 
inquiry. The Trump administration has 
explained that it was not validly part 
of the impeachment inquiry, but that 
is the ground on which they are liti-
gating under. 
They say that they have no time for 
the courts. I think what that really 
means is they have no time for the rule 
of law in the way that they are pur-
suing the inquiry. The other day, one 
of the House managers actually said on 
the floor of the Senate that they had to 
get it moving. They couldn’t wait for 
litigation. They had to impeach the 
President before the election. That is 
not a valid reason to not pursue litiga-
tion in the courts. 
I think it is relevant to bear in mind 
what sort of delay are we talking 
about? In the McGahn case that the 
House managers referred to a number 
of times—which they have pointed out, 
they presented as being very long and 
drawn out—they issued a subpoena in 
April, but they did not file a lawsuit 
until August. By November—November 
25—they had a decision from the dis-
trict court, and it was argued on appeal 
in the DC Circuit on January 3. For 
litigation, that is pretty fast, and it 
can go faster. 
In the Nixon case, during Watergate, 
the special prosecutor issued a sub-
poena on April 18, 1974. On May 20—so 
in less than a month—the district 
court denied a motion to quash the 
subpoena. On May 31, the Supreme 
Court agreed to hear the case, granting 
cert before judgment in the Court of 
Appeals, and on July 24, the Supreme 
Court issued the decision. That is 
lightning fast. 
So when there is urgency to the case, 
when there is a reason for it, there can 
be expedition in the courts, and a deci-
sion can be had in a timely manner. 
In the one case that actually arose 
from these impeachment proceedings, 
it was the House that derailed the case. 
This was the case involving Deputy Na-
tional 
Security 
Advisor 
Charlie 
Kupperman, because when he received 
a subpoena, he went to court and asked 
the court for a declaratory judgment 
explaining what his obligations were: 
Should he take the directive from the 
President that he was immune and not 
go or should he obey the subpoena? 
Now, in that case, he filed suit on Octo-
ber 25. The court, within a few days, set 
an expedited briefing schedule, but the 
House withdrew the subpoena on No-
vember 5, just 11 days later, in order to 
moot the case. 
So I think litigation is a viable ave-
nue, along with the accommodation 
process, as a first step. Then, if the 
House believes it can go to court and 
wants to litigate the jurisdiction and 
litigate the validity of its subpoenas, 
that is also available to them, but im-
peachment as the first step doesn’t 
make any sense. 
I should point out, in part, when the 
House managers say they didn’t have 
time to litigate, they didn’t have time 
to go to the courts, but they now come 
to this Chamber and say this Chamber 
should issue some more subpoenas, this 
Chamber should get some witnesses 
that we didn’t bother to fight about, 
what do you think will happen then? 
That there will not be similar asser-
tions of privilege and immunity? That 
there wouldn’t be litigation about 
that? 
Again, this goes back to the point 
that I made. If you put your impri-
matur on a process that was broken 
and say, yes, that was a great way to 
run things, this was a great package to 
bring here, and we will clean up the 
mess and issue subpoenas and try to do 
all the work that wasn’t done, then 
that becomes the new normal, and that 
doesn’t make sense for this body. 
A proper way to have things handled 
is to have the House—if it wants to 
bring an impeachment here ready for 
trial—do the investigation. The infor-
mation it wants to get, if there is going 
to be resistance, that has to be re-
solved, and it has to be ready to pro-
ceed, not transfer the responsibility to 
this Chamber to do the work that 
hasn’t been done. 
They 
also 
assert 
that 
President 
Trump’s assertion of these privileges is 
somehow different because it is unprec-
edented, and it is categorical. Well, it 
is unprecedented, perhaps, in the sense 
that there was a broad statement that 
a lot of subpoenas wouldn’t be com-
plied with, but that is because it was 
unprecedented for the House to begin

these proceedings without voting to 
authorize the committee to issue the 
subpoenas. That was the first unprece-
dented step. That is what had never 
happened before in history. So, of 
course, the response to that would be, 
in some sense, unprecedented. The 
President simply pointed out that 
without that vote, there were no valid 
subpoenas. 
There have also been categorical re-
fusals in the past. President Truman, 
when the House Committee on Un- 
American Activities, in 1948, issued 
subpoenas to his administration, issued 
a directive to the entire executive 
branch that any subpoena or demand 
or request for information, reports, or 
files in the nature described in those 
subpoenas shall be respectfully de-
clined on the basis of this directive, 
and he referred also to inquiries of the 
Office of the President for such re-
sponse as the President may determine 
to be in the public interest. The Tru-
man administration responded to none 
of them. 
A last point on the House Democrats’ 
claim that privileges simply disappear 
because this is impeachment power of 
the House. They have referred a num-
ber of times to United States v. Nixon, 
the Supreme Court decision, suggesting 
that that somehow determines that 
when you are in an impeachment in-
quiry, executive privilege falls away. 
That is not true. In fact, United States 
v. Nixon was not even actually address-
ing a congressional subpoena. It was a 
subpoena from the special prosecutor, 
and even in that context, the Court did 
not state that executive privilege sim-
ply disappears. Instead, the Court said: 
‘‘It is necessary to resolve these com-
peting interests’’—they are the inter-
ests of the judicial branch in admin-
istering a criminal prosecution in a 
case where the evidence was needed— 
‘‘these competing interests in a man-
ner that preserves the essential func-
tions of each branch.’’ 
And it even held out the possibility 
that in the field of foreign relations 
and national security, there might be 
something approaching an absolute ex-
ecutive privilege. That is exactly the 
field we are in, in this case—foreign re-
lations and national security matters. 
Another thing you have heard is that 
President Clinton voluntarily cooper-
ated with the investigation that led to 
his impeachment—produced tens of 
thousands of documents. That is not 
really accurate. That was only after 
long litigation again and again about 
assertions of privilege. He asserted nu-
merous privileges. The House Judiciary 
Committee then explained ‘‘during the 
Lewinsky 
investigation, 
President 
Clinton abused his power through re-
peated privilege assertions of executive 
privilege by at least five of his aides.’’ 
Unlike the House in this case, Inde-
pendent Counsel Starr first negotiated 
with the White House and then liti-
gated those claims and got them re-
solved. Ultimately, the House man-
agers argued that all of the problems 
with their obstruction theory should be 
brushed aside and the President’s as-
sertions of immunities and defenses 
have to be treated as something nefar-
ious because, as Mr. NADLER said: Only 
guilty people try to hide the evidence. 
That is what he said from last Tuesday 
night. And Mr. SCHIFF, similarly, in 
discussing the assertion of the execu-
tive branch’s constitutional rights, 
said: ‘‘The innocent do not act this 
way.’’ 
Really? Is that the principle in the 
United States of America that if you 
assert legal privileges or rights, that 
means you are guilty? If the innocent 
don’t assert their rights, that the 
President can’t defend the constitu-
tional prerogatives of his office? 
That doesn’t make any sense. At bot-
tom, the second Article of Impeach-
ment comes down to a dispute over a 
legal issue relating to constitutional 
limits on the ability of the House to 
compel information from the Execu-
tive. No matter how House Democrats 
try to dress up their charges, a dif-
ference of legal opinion does not rise to 
the level of impeachment. 
Until now, the House has repeatedly 
rejected 
attempts 
to 
impeach 
the 
President based on legal disputes over 
assertions of privilege. As Judge Starr 
pointed 
out, 
in 
the 
Clinton 
pro-
ceedings, the House Judiciary Com-
mittee concluded that the President 
had improperly exercised executive 
privilege, yet still concluded that it did 
not have the ability to second-guess 
the rationale behind the President or 
what was in his mind asserting execu-
tive privilege, and it could not treat 
that as an impeachable offense. It re-
jected 
an 
Article 
of 
Impeachment 
based on Clinton’s assertions of privi-
lege. 
And as the House Democrat’s own 
witness, Professor Gerhardt, has ex-
plained, in 1843, President Tyler simi-
larly was investigated for potential im-
peachment—his attempts to protect 
and assert what he regarded as the pre-
rogatives of his office as he resisted de-
mands for information from Congress. 
Professor Gerhardt explained Tyler’s 
attempt to protect and assert what he 
regarded as the prerogatives of his of-
fice were the function of his constitu-
tional and policy judgments, and they 
could not be used by Congress to im-
peach him. President Trump’s resist-
ance to congressional subpoenas was no 
less a function of his constitutional 
and policy judgment, and it provides no 
basis to impeach him. 
I would like to close with a final 
thought. One of the greatest issues— 
and perhaps the greatest issue—for 
your consideration in this case is how 
the precedent set in this case will af-
fect the future. 
The Framers recognized that there 
would be partisan and illegitimate im-
peachments. In Federalist No. 65, Ham-
ilton expressly warned about impeach-
ments that reflected what he called 
‘‘the persecution of an intemperate or 
designing majority in the House of 
Representatives.’’ That is exactly what 
this case presents. 
Justice Story recognized that the 
Senate provides the proper tribunal for 
trying impeachments because it was 
believed by the Framers to have a 
greater sense of obligation to the fu-
ture, to future generations, not to be 
swayed by the passions of the moment. 
One of the essential questions here is, 
Will the Chamber adopt a standard for 
impeachment—a 
diluted 
standard— 
that fundamentally disrupts, damages, 
and alters the separation of powers in 
our constitutional structure of govern-
ment? Because that is what both the 
first article—for reasons that Judge 
Starr and Professor Dershowitz have 
covered—and the second article, the 
obstruction charge, would do. 
I will close with a quotation from one 
of the Republican Senators who crossed 
the aisle and voted against convicting 
President Andrew Johnson during his 
impeachment trial. It was Lyman 
Trumbull who I think explained the 
great principle that applies here. He 
said: 
‘‘Once [we] set the example of impeaching 
a President for what, when the excitement of 
the hour shall have subsided will be regarded 
as insufficient causes, no future President 
will be safe . . . and what then becomes of 
the checks and balances of the constitution, 
so carefully devised and so vital to its per-
petuity? They are all gone. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
I will yield to Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, House 
managers, Mr. Philbin just concluded 
on the importance of executive privi-
lege. 
Professor Turley, who testified before 
the House, said we have three branches 
of government, not two. If you impeach 
a President, if you make a high crime 
and misdemeanor out of going to court, 
it is an abuse of power. It is your abuse 
of power. 
With regard to executive privilege, it 
was Mr. NADLER who called it ‘‘execu-
tive privilege and other nonsense.’’ 
When Attorney General Holder re-
fused to comply with subpoenas, Presi-
dent Obama invoked executive privi-
lege, arguing ‘‘compelled disclosure 
would be inconsistent with the separa-
tion of powers established in the Con-
stitution’’—‘‘executive 
privilege 
and 
other nonsense.’’ 
Manager SCHIFF wrote that the White 
House assertion of executive privilege 
was backed by decades of precedent 
that has been recognized and has recog-
nized the need for the President and his 
senior advisers to receive candid advice 
and information from their top aides— 
‘‘executive privilege and other non-
sense.’’ 
We talked about this the other night. 
The nonsense is to treat the separation 
of powers and constitutional privileges 
as if they are asbestos in the ceiling 
tiles. You can’t touch them. That is 
not the way the Constitution is de-
signed. 
We are going to now turn our atten-
tion to a separate topic. It is one that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S596 
January 27, 2020 
has been discussed a lot on the floor 
here and will be discussed now. 
Presenting for the President is the 
former attorney general for the State 
of Florida, Pam Bondi. She is also a ca-
reer 
prosecutor. 
She 
has 
handled 
countless cases. She is going to discuss 
an issue that the House managers have 
put pretty much at the center of their 
case, and that is the issue of corruption 
in Ukraine, particularly with regard to 
a company known as Burisma. 
Mr. Chief Justice, I yield my time to 
former Attorney General Pam Bondi. 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, Members of the Senate, 
when the House managers gave you 
their presentation, when they sub-
mitted their brief, they repeatedly ref-
erenced Hunter Biden and Burisma. 
They spoke to you for over 21 hours, 
and they referenced Biden or Burisma 
over 400 times. And when they gave 
these presentations, they said there 
was nothing—nothing—to see. It was a 
sham. This is fiction. 
In their trial memorandum, the 
House managers described this as base-
less. Why did they say that? Why did 
they invoke Biden or Burisma over 400 
times? The reason they needed to do 
that is because they are here saying 
that the President must be impeached 
and removed from office for raising a 
concern, and that is why we have to 
talk about this today. 
They say sham. They say baseless. 
They say this because if it is OK for 
someone to say, ‘‘hey, you know what, 
maybe there is something here worth 
raising,’’ then, their case crumbles. 
They have to prove beyond a reason-
able doubt that there is no basis to 
raise this concern, but that is not what 
public records show. 
Here are just a few of the public 
sources that flagged questions sur-
rounding this very same issue. The 
United Kingdom’s Serious Fraud Of-
fice, Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
State George Kent, Hunter Biden’s 
former business associate, ABC White 
House reporter, ABC’s Good Morning 
America, the Washington Post, the 
New York Times, Ukrainian law en-
forcement, and the Obama State De-
partment itself—they all raised this 
issue. 
We would prefer not to be talking 
about this. We would prefer not to be 
discussing this. But the House man-
agers have placed this squarely at 
issue. So we must address it. 
Let’s look at the facts. In early 2014, 
Joe Biden, our Vice President of the 
United States, led the U.S. foreign pol-
icy in Ukraine with the goal of rooting 
out corruption. According to an annual 
study published by Transparency Inter-
national, during this time, Ukraine 
was one of the most corrupt countries 
in the entire world. 
There is a natural gas company in 
Ukraine called Burisma. Burisma has 
been owned by an oligarch named 
Mykola Zlochevsky. Here is what hap-
pened very shortly after Vice President 
Biden was made U.S. point man for 
Ukraine. His son Hunter Biden ends up 
on the board of Burisma, working for 
and paid by the oligarch Zlochevsky. 
In February 2014, in the wake of anti- 
corruption uprising by the people of 
Ukraine, Zlochevsky flees the country, 
flees Ukraine. Zlochevsky, the oli-
garch, is well-known. 
George Kent, the very first witness 
that the Democrats called during their 
public 
hearings, 
testified 
that 
Zlochevsky stood out for his self-deal-
ings, even among other oligarchs. 
House managers didn’t tell you that. 
Ambassador Kurt Volker explained 
that Burisma had ‘‘a very bad reputa-
tion as a company for corruption and 
money laundering.’’ House managers 
didn’t tell you that. 
Burisma was so corrupt that George 
Kent said he intervened to prevent 
USAID from cosponsoring an event 
with Burisma. Do you know what this 
event was? It was a child’s contest, and 
the prize was a camera. They were so 
bad—Burisma—that 
our 
country 
wouldn’t even cosponsor a children’s 
event with Burisma. 
In March 2014, the United Kingdom’s 
Serious Fraud Office opened a money 
laundering investigation into the oli-
garch, Zlochevsky, and the company 
Burisma. The very next month, April 
2014, according to a public report, Hun-
ter Biden quietly joins the board of 
Burisma. 
Remember, early 2014 was when Vice 
President Biden began leading Ukraine 
policy. 
Here is how Hunter Biden came to 
join Burisma’s board in 2014. He was 
brought on the board by Devon Archer, 
his business partner. Devon Archer was 
college roommates with Chris Heinz, 
the stepson of Secretary of State John 
Kerry. All three men—Hunter Biden, 
Devon Archer, and Chris Heinz—had all 
started an investment firm together. 
Public records show that on April 16, 
2014, Devon Archer meets with Vice 
President Biden at the White House. 
Just 2 days later, on April 18, 2014, 
Hunter Biden quietly joins Burisma. 
That is according to public reporting. 
Remember, this is just 1 month after 
the United Kingdom’s Serious Fraud 
Office opened a money laundering case 
into Burisma, and Hunter Biden joins 
their board. 
And not only 10 days after Hunter 
Biden joins the board, British authori-
ties seized $23 million in British bank 
accounts connected to the oligarch 
Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma. Did 
Hunter Biden leave the board then? No. 
The British authorities also an-
nounced that they had started a crimi-
nal investigation into potential money 
laundering. Did Hunter Biden leave the 
board? No. 
What happened was, then—and only 
then—did the company chose to an-
nounce that Hunter Biden had joined 
the board after the assets of Burisma 
and its oligarch owner, Zlochevsky, 
were frozen and a criminal investiga-
tion had begun. Hunter Biden’s deci-
sion to join Burisma raised flags al-
most immediately. 
One article from May 2014 stated 
that, ‘‘the appointment of Joe Biden’s 
son to the board of the Ukrainian gas 
firm Burisma has raised eyebrows the 
world over.’’ 
Even an outlet with bias for Demo-
crats pointed out Hunter Biden’s ac-
tivities created a conflict of interest 
for Joe Biden. The article stated: ‘‘The 
move raises questions about a poten-
tial conflict of interest for Joe Biden.’’ 
Even Chris Heinz, Hunter Biden’s 
own business partner, had grave con-
cerns. He thought that working with 
Burisma was unacceptable. This is 
Chris Heinz. He was worried about the 
corruption, the geopolitical risk, and 
how bad it would look. So he wisely 
distances himself from Hunter Biden 
and Devon Archer’s appointments to 
Burisma. 
He didn’t simply call his stepfather, 
the Secretary of State, and say: I have 
a problem with this. He didn’t tell his 
friends: Hey, guys, I am not getting on 
the board. I want nothing to do with 
this. 
He went so far as to send an email to 
senior 
State 
Department 
officials 
about this issue. This is Chris Heinz. 
He wrote: 
Apparently, Devon and Hunter have joined 
the board of Burisma, and a press release 
went out today. I can’t speak [to] why they 
decided to, but there is no investment by our 
firm in their company. 
What did Hunter Biden do? He stayed 
on the board. What did Chris Heinz do? 
He subsequently stopped doing business 
with his college roommate Devon Ar-
cher and his friend Hunter Biden. Chris 
Heinz’ spokesperson said the lack of 
judgment in this matter was a major 
catalyst for Mr. Heinz ending his busi-
ness relationship with Mr. Archer and 
Mr. Biden. 
Now, the media also noticed. The 
same day, an ABC News reporter asked 
Obama White House Press Secretary 
Jay Carney about it. Here is what hap-
pened. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Jon KARL. Hunter Biden has now taken a 
position with the largest oil and gas com-
pany—holding company in Ukraine. Is there 
any concern about at least the appearance of 
a conflict there—the Vice President’s son— 
Jay CARNEY. I would refer you to the Vice 
President’s Office. I saw those reports. You 
know, Hunter Biden and other members of 
the Biden family are obviously private citi-
zens, and where they work does not reflect 
an endorsement by the administration or by 
the Vice President or President. But I would 
refer you to the Vice President’s Office. 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. The next day, 
the Washington Post ran a story about 
it. It said: ‘‘The appointment of the 
Vice President’s son to a Ukrainian oil 
board looks nepotistic at best, nefar-
ious at worst.’’ Again, ‘‘The appoint-
ment of the Vice President’s son to a 
Ukrainian oil board looks nepotistic at 
best, nefarious at worst.’’ 
And the media didn’t stop asking 
questions here. It kept going. Here is 
ABC. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Vice President BIDEN. You have to fight 
the cancer of corruption.

LLAMAS. But then something strange 
happened. Just three weeks later a Ukrain-
ian natural gas company, Burisma, accused 
of corruption appoints Hunter Biden, seen 
here in their promotional videos, to their 
board of directors, paying his firm more than 
a million dollars a year. 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. Here is more 
from ABC, continued on. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
LLAMAS. And Ukraine wasn’t the only 
country where Hunter Biden’s business and 
his father’s diplomacy as Vice President 
intersected. It also happened in China. This 
video shows Chinese diplomats greeting Vice 
President Biden as he arrived in Beijing in 
December of 2013. Right by his side, his son 
Hunter. Less than 2 weeks later, Hunter’s 
firm had new business, creating an invest-
ment fund in China involving the govern-
ment-controlled Bank of China, with reports 
they hoped to raise $1.5 billion. 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. In fact, every 
witness who was asked about Hunter 
Biden’s 
involvement 
with 
Burisma 
agreed there was a potential appear-
ance of a conflict of interest. Multiple 
House Democratic witnesses, including 
those from the Department of State, 
the National Security Council, and 
others, unanimously testified there 
was a potential appearance of a con-
flict of interest. These were their wit-
nesses. 
How much money did Hunter Biden 
get for being on the board? Well, if we 
start looking at these bank records, ac-
cording to reports, between April 2014 
and October 2015, Burisma paid more 
than $3.1 million to Devon Archer and 
Hunter Biden. That is over the course 
of a year and a half. How do we know 
this? Some of Devon Archer’s bank 
records were disclosed during an unre-
lated Federal criminal case having 
nothing to do with Hunter Biden. 
These bank records show 17 months 
that Burisma wired two payments of 
$83,333—not just for 1 month, for 2 
months, for 3 months, but for 17 
months. According to Reuters, sources 
report that of the two payments of 
$83,333 each, one was for Hunter Biden 
and one, Devon Archer. 
Hunter Biden was paid significantly 
more than board members for major 
U.S. Fortune 100 companies such as 
Goldman 
Sachs, 
Comcast, 
and 
Citigroup. The typical board member 
of these Fortune 100 companies, we 
know, are the titans of their industry. 
They are highly qualified, and as such, 
they are well compensated. Even so, 
Hunter Biden was paid significantly 
more. This is how well he was com-
pensated: Hunter Biden was paid over 
$83,000 a month, while the average 
American family of four, during that 
time, each year made less than $54,000. 
That is according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau during that time. 
This is what has been reported about 
his work on the board. The Washington 
Post said: ‘‘What specific duties Hunter 
Biden carried out for Burisma are not 
fully known.’’ The New Yorker re-
ported: ‘‘Once or twice a year, he at-
tended Burisma board meetings and en-
ergy forums that took place in Eu-
rope.’’ 
When speaking with ABC News about 
his qualifications to be on Burisma’s 
board, Hunter Biden didn’t point to 
any of the usual qualifications of a 
board member. Hunter Biden had no 
experience in natural gas, no experi-
ence in the energy sector, and no expe-
rience with Ukrainian regulatory af-
fairs. As far as we know, he doesn’t 
speak Ukrainian. So naturally the 
media has asked questions about his 
board membership. Why was Hunter 
Biden on this board? 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Amy ROBACH. If your last name wasn’t 
Biden, do you think you would’ve been asked 
to be on the board of Burisma? 
Mr. Hunter BIDEN. I don’t know. I don’t 
know. Probably not. 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. So let’s go back 
and talk about his time on the board. 
Remember, 
he 
joined 
Burisma’s 
board in April 2014, while the United 
Kingdom had an open money laun-
dering case against Burisma and its 
owner, the oligarch Zlochevsky. On Au-
gust 20, 2014, 4 months later, the 
Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office 
initiates a money laundering investiga-
tion 
into 
the 
same 
oligarch, 
Zlochevsky. This is one of 15 investiga-
tions into Burisma and Zlochevsky, ac-
cording to a recent public statement 
made by the current prosecutor gen-
eral. 
On January 16, 2015, prosecutors put 
Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma, on 
whose board Hunter Biden sat, on the 
country’s wanted list for fraud—while 
Hunter Biden is on the board. 
Then a British court orders that 
Zlochevsky’s $23 million in assets be 
unfrozen. 
Why 
was 
the 
money 
unfrozen? Deputy Assistant Secretary 
Kent testified to it. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
KENT. Somebody in the General Prosecu-
tor’s Office of Ukraine shut the case, issued 
a letter to his lawyer, and that money went 
poof. 
CASTOR. So essentially paid a bribe to 
make the case go away. 
KENT. That is our strong assumption, yes, 
sir. 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. He also testified 
that the Ukrainian prosecutor gen-
eral’s 
office 
actions 
led 
to 
the 
unfreezing of the assets. 
After George Kent’s confirmation, 
that 
prosecutor 
was 
out. 
Viktor 
Shokin becomes prosecutor general. 
This is the prosecutor you will hear 
about later, the one Vice President 
Biden has publicly said he wanted out 
of office. 
In addition to flagging questions 
about previous prosecutors’ actions, 
George Kent also specifically voiced 
other concerns—this time to the Vice 
President’s 
Office—about 
Hunter 
Biden. In February 2015, he raised con-
cerns about Hunter Biden to Vice 
President Biden’s Office. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
KENT. In a briefing call with the National 
Security staff in the Office of the Vice Presi-
dent in February 2015, I raised my concern 
that Hunter Biden’s status as a board mem-
ber could create the perception of a conflict 
of interest. 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. But House man-
agers didn’t tell you that. 
This is all while Hunter Biden sat on 
Burisma’s board. Did Hunter Biden 
stop working for Burisma? No. Did 
Vice President Biden stop leading the 
Obama administration’s foreign policy 
efforts in Ukraine? No. In the mean-
time, Vice President Biden is still at 
the forefront of the U.S.-Ukraine pol-
icy. He pledges a billion-dollar loan 
guarantee to Ukraine contingent on its 
progress in rooting out corruption. 
Around the same time as the $1 bil-
lion announcement, other people raised 
the issue of a conflict. As the Obama 
administration special envoy for en-
ergy policy told the New Yorker, he 
raised Hunter Biden’s participation on 
the board of Burisma directly with the 
Vice President himself. This is a spe-
cial envoy to President Obama. 
The media had questions too. On De-
cember 8, 2015, the New York Times 
publishes an article that Prosecutor 
General 
Shokin 
was 
investigating 
Burisma and its owner, Zlochevsky. 
Here is their quote: ‘‘The credibility of 
the 
vice 
president’s 
anticorruption 
message may have been undermined by 
the association of his son, Hunter 
Biden,’’ with Burisma and its owner, 
Zlochevsky. 
And it wasn’t just one reporter who 
asked questions about the line between 
Burisma and the Obama administra-
tion. As we learned recently through 
reporting on FOX News, on January 19, 
2016, there was a meeting between 
Obama administration officials and 
Ukrainian prosecutors. 
Ken Vogel, journalist for the New 
York Times, asked the State Depart-
ment about this meeting. He wanted 
more information about the meeting 
‘‘where U.S. support for prosecutions of 
Burisma Holdings in the United King-
dom and Ukraine were discussed.’’ But 
the story never ran. 
Around the time of the reported 
story—January 2016—a meeting be-
tween the Obama administration and 
Ukrainian officials took place, and a 
Ukrainian press report, as translated, 
says: The U.S. Department of State 
made it clear to the Ukrainian authori-
ties that it was linking the $1 billion in 
loan guarantees to the dismissal of 
Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. 
Now, we all know the Obama admin-
istration, from the words of Vice Presi-
dent Biden himself—he advocated for 
the prosecutor general’s dismissal. 
There was ongoing investigation into 
the oligarch Zlochevsky, the owner of 
Burisma, at the time. We know this be-
cause on February 2, 2016, the Ukrain-
ian prosecutor general obtained a re-
newal of a court order to seize the 
Ukrainian oligarch’s assets. A Kyiv 
Post article published on February 4, 
2015, says the oligarch Zlochevsky is 
‘‘suspected of committing a criminal 
offense of illicit enrichment.’’ 
Over the next few weeks, the Vice 
President 
had 
multiple 
calls 
with 
Ukraine’s President Poroshenko. 
Days after the last call, on February 
24, 2016, a DC consultant reached out to

the State Department to request a 
meeting to discuss Burisma. We know 
what she said because the email was re-
leased under the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act. The consultant explicitly in-
voked Hunter Biden’s name as a board 
member. 
In an email summarizing the call, the 
State Department official says that the 
consultant noted that two high-profile 
citizens are affiliated with the com-
pany, including Hunter Biden as a 
board member. She added that the con-
sultant would like to talk with Under 
Secretary of State Novelli about get-
ting a better understanding of how the 
United States came to the determina-
tion that the country is corrupt. 
To be clear, this email documents 
that the U.S. Government had deter-
mined Burisma to be corrupt, and the 
consultant was seeking a meeting with 
an extremely senior State Department 
official to discuss the U.S. Govern-
ment’s position. Her pitch for the 
meeting 
specifically 
used 
Hunter 
Biden’s name, and according to the 
email, the meeting was set for a few 
days later. 
Later that month, on March 29, 2016, 
the Ukrainian Parliament finally votes 
to fire the prosecutor general. This is 
the prosecutor general investigating 
the oligarch, owner of Burisma, on 
whose board Hunter Biden sat. 
Two days after the prosecutor gen-
eral is voted out, Vice President Biden 
announces that the United States will 
provide $335 million in security assist-
ance to Ukraine. He soon announces 
that the United States will provide $1 
billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine. 
Let’s talk about one of the Demo-
crats’ central witnesses: Ambassador 
Yovanovich. In May 2016, Ambassador 
Yovanovitch was nominated to be Am-
bassador to Ukraine. Here is what hap-
pened when she was preparing for her 
Senate confirmation hearing. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Representative 
RATCLIFFE. 
Congress-
woman Stefanik had asked you how the 
Obama-Biden State Department had pre-
pared 
you 
to 
answer 
questions 
about 
Burisma and Hunter Biden specifically. Do 
you recall that? 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Yes. 
Representative RATCLIFFE. Out of thou-
sands of companies in the Ukraine, the only 
one that you recall the Obama-Biden State 
Department preparing you to answer ques-
tions about was the one where the Vice 
President’s son was on the board, is that 
fair? 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Yes. 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. So she is being 
prepared to come before all of you—all 
of you—and talk about world issues, 
going to be in charge of the Ukraine, 
and what did they feel the only com-
pany—the company—that it was im-
portant to brief her on in case she got 
a question? Burisma. 
Ambassador Yovanovich was con-
firmed July 2016 as the Obama adminis-
tration was coming to a close. In Sep-
tember 2016, a Ukrainian court cancels 
the oligarch Zlochevsky’s arrest war-
rant for lack of progress in the case. 
In mid-January 2017, Burisma an-
nounces that all legal proceedings 
against it and Zlochevsky have been 
closed. Both of these things happened 
while Hunter Biden sat on the board of 
Burisma. Around this time, Vice Presi-
dent Biden leaves office. 
Years later now, former Vice Presi-
dent Biden publicly details what we 
know happened: his threat to withhold 
more than $1 billion in loan guarantees 
unless Shokin was fired. 
Here is the Vice President. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Vice President BIDEN. I said I’m not—we 
are not going to give you the billion dollars. 
They said: You have no authority. You’re 
not the President. The President said—I 
said: Call him. I said: I’m telling you, you 
are not getting the billion dollars. I said: 
You are not getting the billion. I’m going to 
be leaving here in, I think it was about 6 
hours. I looked at them and said: I’m leaving 
in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, 
you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a 
bitch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put 
in place someone who was solid at the time. 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. What he didn’t 
say on the video—according to the New 
York Times, this was the prosecutor 
investigating Burisma, Shokin. 
What he also didn’t say on the video 
was that his son was being paid signifi-
cant amounts by the oligarch owner of 
Burisma to sit on that board. 
Only then does Hunter Biden leave 
the board. He stays on the board until 
April 2019. In November 2019, Hunter 
Biden signs an affidavit saying he ‘‘has 
been unemployed’’ and has no other 
‘‘monthly income since May 2019.’’ 
This was in November of 2019, so we 
know, from after April 2019 to May 2019 
through November 2019, he was unem-
ployed, by his own statement—April 
2019 to November 2019. 
Despite his resignation from the 
board, the media continued to raise the 
issue relating to a potential conflict of 
interest. 
On July 22, 2019, the Washington Post 
wrote that fired Prosecutor General 
Shokin ‘‘believes his ouster was be-
cause of his interest in the company,’’ 
referring to Burisma. The Post further 
wrote that ‘‘had he remained in his 
post, he would have questioned Hunter 
Biden. 
On July 25, 2019, 3 days later, Presi-
dent Trump speaks with President 
Zelensky. He said: 
The other thing, There’s a lot of talk about 
Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecu-
tion and a lot of people want to find out 
about that so whatever you can do with the 
Attorney General would be great. Biden went 
around bragging that he stopped the prosecu-
tion so if you can look into it . . . It looks 
horrible to me. 
The House managers talked about 
the Bidens and Burisma 400 times, but 
they never gave you the full picture. 
But here are those who did: The United 
Kingdom’s Serious Fraud Unit; Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State George 
Kent; Chris Heinz, the ABC White 
House reporter; ABC ‘‘Good Morning 
America’’; the Washington Post; the 
New York Times; Ukrainian law en-
forcement; and the Obama State De-
partment itself. They all thought there 
was cause to raise the issue about the 
Bidens and Burisma. 
The House managers might say, 
without evidence, that everything we 
just have said has been debunked, that 
the evidence points entirely and un-
equivocally in the other direction. 
That is a distraction. 
You have heard from the House man-
agers. They do not believe that there 
was any concern to raise here, that all 
of this was baseless. And all we are 
saying is that there was a basis to talk 
about this, to raise this issue, and that 
is enough. 
I yield my time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Majority Leader MCCONNELL, 
Democratic Leader SCHUMER, House 
managers, Members of the Senate, this 
will be our last presentation before din-
ner. 
The next lawyer representing the 
President is Eric Herschmann. He is a 
partner in the Kasowitz firm, the law 
firm which has been representing the 
President for over two decades. He is a 
former prosecutor and trial lawyer, and 
he ran a natural gas company in the 
United States. 
He is going to discuss additional evi-
dence the House managers ignored or 
misstated and how other Presidents 
might have measured up under this 
new impeachment standard. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
HERSCHMANN. 
Mr. 
Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, I 
am Eric Herschmann. I have the honor 
and privilege of representing the Presi-
dent of the United States in these pro-
ceedings. I have been carefully listen-
ing to and reviewing the House man-
agers’ case. That case pretty much 
boils down to one straightforward con-
tention—that the President abused his 
power to promote his own personal in-
terests and not our country’s interests. 
The House managers say that the 
President did not take the steps that 
they allege for the benefit of our coun-
try but only for his own personal ben-
efit. If that is wrong, if what the Presi-
dent had wanted would have benefited 
our country, then the managers have 
not met their burden, and these Arti-
cles of Impeachment must be rejected. 
As we will see, the House managers do 
not come close to meeting the burden. 
Last week, Manager SCHIFF said that 
the investigations President Trump 
supposedly asked President Zelensky 
about on the July 25 call could not 
have been in the country’s interest be-
cause he said they were ‘‘discredited 
entirely.’’ The House managers say 
that the investigations had been de-
bunked; they were sham investiga-
tions. Now we have the question: Were 
they really? 
The House managers in the over 21 
hours of the repetitive presentation 
never found the time to support those 
conclusory statements. Was it, in fact, 
true that any investigation had been 
debunked? The House managers do not

identify for you who supposedly con-
ducted any investigations, who sup-
posedly did the debunking, who dis-
credited it. Where and when were any 
such investigations conducted? When 
were the results published? And much 
more is left unanswered. 
Attorney 
General 
Bondi 
went 
through for you some of what we know 
about Burisma in its millions of dollars 
in payments to Vice President Biden’s 
son and his son’s business partner. 
There is no question that any ration-
al person would like to understand 
what happened. I am going to go 
through 
some 
additional 
evidence, 
which was easily available to the 
House managers but which they never 
sought or considered. 
Based on what Attorney General 
Bondi told you in this additional evi-
dence, you can judge for yourself 
whether the conduct was suspect. As 
you know, one of the issues concerned 
Hunter Biden’s involvement with the 
Ukrainian natural gas company, which 
paid him millions of dollars while his 
father was Vice President and was in 
charge of the Ukrainian portfolio dur-
ing the prior administration. I will get 
to those supposedly discredited allega-
tions identified by the House managers 
in a few minutes. 
The other issue was what Manager 
SCHIFF called ‘‘the baseless conspiracy 
theory that Ukraine, not Russia, inter-
fered in the 2016 election.’’ 
Manager SCHIFF said that President 
Trump wanted to ‘‘erase from history 
his previous political misconduct.’’ But 
there was no previous political mis-
conduct. If any theory has actually 
been discredited, it is the theory that 
President Trump colluded with Russia 
in 2016. It was that theory that was dis-
credited, and discredited entirely, by 
Mr. Mueller’s massive investigation— 
the same investigation the Democrats 
demanded since President Trump took 
office; the same investigation they 
knew, they were absolutely sure, would 
expose such collusion; the same inves-
tigation, which, after 22 months of ex-
haustive work at a cost to the tax-
payers of $32 million, found no con-
spiracy and no evidence of Russian col-
lusion with the Trump campaign. 
As we will see, the Democrats are as 
wrong now about the Articles of Im-
peachment as they were in 2016 about 
the Russian collusion. 
As to the other incident President 
Trump mentioned—the one concerning 
the Ukrainian gas company Burisma— 
I actually think this is something that 
is undisputed, that Ukraine had a par-
ticularly bad corruption problem. It 
was so corrupt that dealing with cor-
ruption and solving the corruption was 
a priority for our U.S. foreign policy. 
Here is how one knowledgeable ob-
server of Ukraine put it in 2015: 
It’s not enough to set up a new anti-cor-
ruption bureau and establish a special pros-
ecutor fighting corruption. The Office of the 
General Prosecutor desperately needs re-
form. The judiciary should be overhauled. 
The energy sector needs to be competitive, 
ruled by market principles—not sweetheart 
deals. It’s not enough to push through laws 
to increase transparency with regard to offi-
cial sources of income. Senior elected offi-
cials have to remove all conflicts between 
their business interests and their govern-
ment responsibilities. 
As Attorney General Bondi said, here 
are the facts we do know about Hunter 
Biden’s 
involvement 
with 
Ukraine. 
Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas com-
pany, paid Hunter Biden millions of 
dollars to serve on its board of direc-
tors. He did not have any relevant ex-
pertise or experience. He had no exper-
tise or experience in the natural gas in-
dustry. He had no known expertise in 
corporate governance nor any expertise 
in Ukrainian law. He doesn’t, so far as 
we know, speak Ukrainian. So why— 
why—did Burisma want Hunter Biden 
on its board? Why did they want to pay 
him millions of dollars? Well, he did 
have one qualification. He was the son 
of the Vice President of the United 
States. He was the son of the man in 
charge of the Ukrainian portfolio for 
the prior administration. And we are to 
believe there is nothing to see here, 
that for anyone to investigate or in-
quire about this would be a sham— 
nothing to see here. 
But tellingly, Hunter Biden’s attor-
ney, on October 13, 2019, issued a state-
ment on his behalf. He indicated that 
in April 2014, Hunter was asked to join 
the board of Burisma, then states Hun-
ter stepped off Burisma’s board in April 
2019. 
Now listen to the commitment that 
Hunter Biden is supposedly willing to 
make to all of us. Hunter makes the 
following commitment: Under a Biden 
administration, Hunter will readily 
comply with any and all guidelines or 
standards a President Biden may issue 
to address purported conflicts of inter-
est or the appearance of such conflicts, 
including any restrictions related to 
overseas business interests. 
That statement almost tells us all we 
need to know. That is the rule that 
should have been in place in 2014 be-
cause there already was an Obama- 
Biden administration. What changed? 
What changed? 
Remember a couple of minutes ago 
when I quoted an expert on Ukraine, 
the one who said that Ukraine must 
clean up its energy sector, the one who 
said that Ukraine’s senior elected offi-
cials have to remove all conflicts be-
tween their business interests and 
their government responsibilities? You 
know who said that about Ukraine? 
Vice President Joe Biden in December 
of 2015. 
Vice 
President 
Biden 
went 
to 
Ukraine approximately 12 to 13 times. 
He spoke with legislators, business peo-
ple, and officials. He was purportedly 
fighting corruption in Ukraine. He was 
urging Ukraine to investigate and up-
root corruption. 
One thing he apparently did not do, 
however, was to tell his son not to 
trade on his family connections. He did 
not tell his son to especially stay away 
from the energy sector in the very cor-
ruption-ridden country Vice President 
Biden was responsible for. 
And Manager SCHIFF
says: Move 
along; there is nothing to see here. 
What are the House managers afraid of 
finding out? In an interview with ABC 
in October of last year, Hunter Biden 
said he was on the board of Burisma to 
focus on principles of corporate govern-
ance and transparency. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HUNTER BIDEN. Bottom line is that I 
know I was completely qualified to be on the 
board, to head up the corporate governance 
and transparency committee on the board. 
And that’s all that I focused on. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
HERSCHMANN. 
But 
when asked how much money Burisma 
was paying him, he responded he 
doesn’t want to ‘‘open his kimono’’ and 
disclose how much. He does refer to 
public reports about how much he was 
being paid, but as we now know, he was 
being paid far more than what was in 
the public record. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. ROBACH. You were paid $50,000 a 
month for your position? 
Mr. HUNTER BIDEN. Look, I’m a private 
citizen. One thing that I don’t have to do is 
sit here and open my kimono as it relates to 
how much money I make or made or did or 
didn’t. But it’s all been reported. 
Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. So what 
was the real reason that Hunter Biden, 
the Vice President’s son, was being 
paid by Burisma? Was it based on his 
knowledge and understanding of the 
natural gas industry in Ukraine? Was 
he going to discuss how our govern-
ment regulates the energy industry 
here? Was he going to discuss how we 
set gas rates? Was he going to discuss 
pipeline development construction or 
environmental impact statements? Did 
he know anything about the natural 
gas industry at all? Of course not. 
So what was the reason? I think you 
do not need to look any further than 
the explanation that Hunter Biden 
gave during the ABC interview when he 
was asked why. 
Here is what he had to say. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. ROBACH. If your last name wasn’t 
Biden, do you think you would have been 
asked to be on the board of Burisma? 
Mr. HUNTER BIDEN. I don’t know. Prob-
ably no. I don’t think there are a lot of 
things that would have happened in my life 
if my last name wasn’t Biden. 
Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. And as 
if to confirm how suspect this conduct 
was that it should be a concern to our 
country, Hunter Biden and his lawyer 
could 
not 
even 
keep 
their 
story 
straight. Compare the press release 
that was issued by Burisma on May 12, 
2014, with Hunter Biden’s lawyer’s 
statement on October 13 of 2019. The 
May 2014 press release begins: ‘‘R. 
[Robert] Hunter Biden will be in charge 
of holding’s legal unit.’’ He was going 
to be in charge of a Ukrainian gas com-
pany owned by an oligarch’s legal unit. 
However, in his lawyer’s statement in 
October of 2019, after his involvement 
with Burisma came under renewed pub-
lic scrutiny, he now claims: ‘‘At no

time was Hunter in charge of the com-
pany’s legal affairs.’’ 
Which is it? What was Hunter Biden 
doing at Burisma in exchange for mil-
lions of dollars? Who knows? What 
were they looking to hide so much for 
his corporate governance and trans-
parency? 
But let’s take a step back and realize 
what actually transpired, because the 
House managers would have us believe 
this had nothing at all to do with our 
government, nothing at all to do with 
our country’s interests, nothing at all 
to do with our Vice President, nothing 
at all to do with the State Department. 
It was simply private citizen Hunter 
Biden doing his own private business. 
It was purely coincidental that it was 
in his father’s portfolio in Ukraine, in 
the exact sector—the energy sector— 
that his father said was corrupt. 
But we have a document here—again, 
something that House managers did 
not show you or even put before the 
House before voting on these baseless 
Articles of Impeachment. If you look 
at that email, it is an email from Chris 
Heinz. And as Attorney Bondi already 
told you, he is the stepson of the then- 
Secretary of State John Kerry, and he 
was the other business partner with 
Hunter Biden and Devon Archer. Our 
Secretary of State’s stepson and our 
Vice President’s son are in business to-
gether. 
It was sent on May 13, 2014, to the of-
ficial government email addresses of 
two senior people at the State Depart-
ment. These two people are the Chief of 
Staff to the Secretary of State and the 
Special Adviser to the Secretary of 
State. The subject line in the email is 
not ‘‘corporate transparency.’’ It is not 
‘‘corporate 
governance.’’ 
It 
is 
not 
‘‘here’s a heads-up.’’ The subject line is 
‘‘Ukraine.’’ 
Chris Heinz certainly understood the 
sensitivity to our U.S. foreign policy. 
What does the Secretary of State’s 
stepson say about Hunter Biden and 
Devon Archer? He says this: 
Apparently Devon and Hunter both joined 
the board of Burisma and a press release 
went out today. I can’t speak to why they 
decided to, but there was no investment by 
our firm in their company. 
What is the most telling thing about 
this? It is clear that the Chief of Staff 
and the Special Assistant to the Sec-
retary already knew who Devon was 
because Mr. Heinz did not include his 
last name. It is just ‘‘Devon.’’ They ob-
viously knew who Hunter was because, 
again, it is Hunter Biden. This is Chris 
Heinz saying: ‘‘I can’t speak to why 
they decided to join the board of 
Burisma.’’ He is their business part-
ner—not that there were good cor-
porate reasons that they are going 
there for corporate governance, not 
that they are there to enhance cor-
porate transparency, not that they are 
there to further U.S. policy, not that 
they are there to help fight corruption 
in Ukraine, not that they are there to 
ensure boards of directors’ compensa-
tion and benefits are publicly dis-
closed—nothing like that. He cannot 
say those things because he knows 
Devon and Hunter well and he knows 
they have no particular qualifications, 
whatsoever, to do those things, espe-
cially for a Ukrainian gas company. 
Instead, Mr. Heinz is planning to go 
on the record to report what Hunter 
and Devon were doing through official 
channels to take pains to disassociate 
himself from what they were doing. 
And what did the State Department do 
with this information that the Sec-
retary of State’s stepson thought they 
needed to know? Apparently, nothing. 
They did not tell Mr. Heinz to stay 
away. They did not tell Mr. Heinz there 
is no problem—nothing. But all this, 
the House managers want us to believe, 
does not even merit any inquiry. Any-
one asking for one, anyone discussing 
one is now corrupt. 
Does it matter in an inquiry why a 
corrupt company in a corrupt country 
would be paying our Vice President 
son’s a million dollars per year, plus, it 
appears, some additional expenses, and 
paying his business partner an addi-
tional million dollars per year? Sec-
retary of State Kerry’s stepson thought 
it was important enough to report. 
Why aren’t the House managers con-
cerned? 
And I ask you, why would it not 
merit an investigation? You know 
something else about Vice President 
Biden? Well, back in January of 2018, as 
you heard, former Vice President Biden 
bragged that he had pressured the 
Ukrainians—threatened them, indeed, 
coerced them—into firing the state 
prosecutor who reportedly was inves-
tigating the very company that paid 
millions of dollars to his son. He 
bragged that he gave them 6 hours to 
fire the prosecutor or he would cut off 
$1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Vice President BIDEN. I said: We’re not 
going to give you the billion dollars. 
They said: You have no authority. You’re 
not the President. The President said— 
I said: Call him. I said: I’m telling you, 
you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said: 
You’re not getting the billion. I’m going to 
be leaving here in—I think it was, what—6 
hours. I looked at him and said: I’m leaving 
in 6 hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, 
you’re not getting the money. 
Well, son of a bitch, he got fired, and they 
put in place someone who was solid at the 
time. 
Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Are we 
really to believe it was the policy of 
our government to withhold $1 billion 
of guarantees to Ukraine unless they 
fired a prosecutor on the spot? Was 
that really our policy? We have all 
heard continuously from the managers 
and many agree about the risks to the 
Ukrainians posed by the Russians. We 
have heard the managers say that a 
slight delay in providing funding to 
Ukraine endangers our national secu-
rity and jeopardizes our interests and, 
therefore, the President must imme-
diately be removed from office. Yet, 
they also argue that it was the official 
policy of our country to withhold $1 
billion unless one individual was fired 
within a certain matter of hours. Was 
that really or could it ever be our 
United States policy? 
According to the House managers’ 
theory, we were willing to jeopardize 
Ukrainians unless somebody who hap-
pened to be investigating Burisma was 
promptly fired. Are we going to jeop-
ardize a Ukrainian economy because a 
prosecutor was not fired in the 6-hour 
time period Vice President Biden de-
manded? Does anyone really believe 
that was or ever could be our U.S. for-
eign policy? And, just in case, the man-
agers or others tried to argue: No, no, 
no, he wasn’t serious about that; he 
was just bluffing. What kind of mes-
sage would that send to the Russians 
about our support for the Ukrainians 
that we would bluff and bluff with the 
Ukrainian economy? 
From 2014 to 2017, Vice President 
Biden claimed to be on a crusade 
against corruption in Ukraine. He re-
peatedly spoke about how the cancer of 
corruption was endemic in Ukraine, 
hobbled Ukraine, how Ukraine faced no 
more consequential mission than con-
fronting corruption, and he encouraged 
Ukraine to close the space for corrupt 
middlemen who rip off the Ukrainian 
people. 
The 
Vice 
President 
railed 
against monopolistic behavior where a 
select few profit from so many sweet-
heart deals that has characterized that 
country for so long. 
On his last official visit to Ukraine, 4 
days before he left office, he spoke out 
against corruption and oligarchy, that 
eats away like a cancer, and against 
corruption, which continues to eat 
away at Ukraine’s democracy within. 
Why was Vice President doing this? 
Was he so concerned about corruption 
in Ukraine—even singling out that 
country’s energy sector—because cor-
ruption in Ukraine is a critical policy 
concern for our country? 
But during this whole time, what else 
was happening? His son and his son’s 
business partner were raking in over $1 
million a year from what was regarded 
as one of the most corrupt Ukrainian 
companies in the energy sector, owned 
and controlled by one of the most cor-
rupt oligarchs. Were Vice President 
Biden’s words and advice to Ukraine 
just hollow? According to the House 
managers, the answer apparently is 
yes, they were empty words, at least 
when it came to anyone questioning 
his son’s own sweetheart deal, his own 
son’s deal with Ukraine’s corruption 
and oligarchy. 
Again, to raise Manager SCHIFF’s own 
question: What kind of message did 
this send to future U.S. Government of-
ficials? Your family can accept money 
from foreign corrupt companies? No 
problem. You can pay family members 
of our highest government officials, 
and no one is allowed to even ask ques-
tions. 
What was going on? We have to just 
accept now the House managers’ con-
clusory statements, like ‘‘sham,’’ ‘‘dis-
crediting,’’ even though no one has

ever investigated why. And can you 
imagine what House Manager SCHIFF 
and his fellow Democratic Representa-
tives would say if it were President 
Trump’s children on an oligarch’s pay-
roll? 
And when it finally appeared that a 
true Ukrainian corruption fighter had 
assumed 
the 
country’s 
Presidency, 
President Trump was not supposed to— 
he was not permitted to—- follow up on 
Vice President Biden’s own words 
about fighting corruption and try to 
make those words something other 
than empty? 
According to the House managers, 
Ukrainian corruption is now only a pri-
vate interest. It no longer is a serious 
important concern for our country. 
Now I want to take a moment to 
cover a few additional points about the 
July 25 telephone call in which the 
House managers believe that the Presi-
dent of the United States, in their 
words, was shaking down and pres-
suring the President of Ukraine to do 
his personal bidding. 
First of all, this was not the first 
telephone call that the President of the 
United States had with other foreign 
leaders. Think about this for a mo-
ment. The call was routed through the 
Situation Room. It was a scheduled 
call. There were other people on the 
call. There were other people taking 
notes. Obviously, the President was 
aware of that fact. 
The House managers talked about 
the fact that the President did not fol-
low the approved talking points as if 
the President—any President—is obli-
gated 
to 
follow 
approved 
talking 
points. The last time I checked—and I 
think this is clear to the American 
people—President Trump knows how to 
speak his mind. 
Do you remember the fake transcript 
that Manager SCHIFF read when he was 
before the Intelligence Committee—his 
mob, gangster-like, fake rendition of 
the call? Well, I prosecuted organized 
crime for years. The type of description 
of what goes on—what House Manager 
SCHIFF tried to create for the American 
people—is completely detached from 
reality. It is as if we were supposed to 
believe that mobsters would invite peo-
ple they do not know into an organized 
crime meeting to sit around and take 
notes to establish their corrupt intent. 
Manager SCHIFF, our jobs as prosecu-
tors—and I know you were one—would 
have been a lot easier if that were how 
it worked. 
Think about what he is saying. 
Think about the managers’ position: 
that our President decided with cor-
rupt intent to shake down, in their 
words, another foreign leader, and he 
decided to do it in front of everyone, in 
a documented conversation, in the 
presence of people he did not even 
know, just so he could get this personal 
benefit that was not in our country’s 
interest. This logic is flawed—it is 
completely illogical—because that is 
not what happened, and that is why 
Manager SCHIFF ran away from the ac-
tual transcript. That is why he created 
his own, fake conversation. 
I would like to just address another 
point, for the transcript, of the July 25 
phone call. 
The House managers alleged that an 
Oval Office meeting with the President 
was critical to the newly elected 
Ukrainian President because it would 
signal to Russia, which had invaded 
Ukraine in 2014 and still occupied 
Ukrainian 
territory, 
that 
Ukraine 
could count on American support. They 
actually argued that it was a quid pro 
quo, that the President withheld this 
critical Oval Office meeting that would 
deter 
the 
Russians 
and 
save 
the 
Ukrainians because he wanted some-
thing personal. 
Now, if that were, in fact, critical to 
President Zelensky for the safety of his 
own citizens, he would have imme-
diately jumped at the opportunity to 
come to the Oval Office, especially 
when President Trump offered him 
that invitation during the July 25 call. 
Let’s see what President Zelensky ac-
tually said when he was invited to 
Washington on that call. 
He does not say: Oh, this is what I 
would like to do. It is critical for my 
people. We will arrange it in a meeting. 
His response is: 
I would be very happy to come and would 
be happy to meet you personally and get to 
know you better . . . On the other hand, I be-
lieve that, on September 1, we will be in Po-
land, and we could meet in Poland, hope-
fully. 
If an Oval Office meeting were crit-
ical to President Zelensky, that was 
the time to say so, not to suggest an-
other venue. 
When we look at the evidence that is 
before us, it is clear that the only peo-
ple who talked about having an Oval 
Office meeting were lower level govern-
ment employees who thought it was a 
good idea. But for the principals in-
volved, those who actually make the 
decisions—President Zelensky, Presi-
dent Trump—to them, it was not crit-
ical, it was not material, and it was 
definitely never a quid pro quo. What 
was important to President Zelensky 
was not an Oval Office meeting but the 
lethal weapons that President Trump 
supplied to Ukraine and the sanctions 
that President Trump enforced against 
the Russians. That is what the tran-
script of the July 25 call demonstrates. 
Let us now consider what President 
Zelensky knew about the support that 
President 
Trump 
had 
provided 
to 
Ukraine compared to the support—or 
more accurately, the lack thereof— 
that the prior administration had pro-
vided to Ukraine. 
In February 2004, Russia began its 
military campaign against Ukraine. 
Against the advice and urgings of Con-
gress and of many in his own adminis-
tration, President Obama refused then 
and throughout the remainder of his 
Presidency to provide lethal assistance 
to Ukraine. 
In the House, Manager SCHIFF joined 
many of his colleagues in a letter-writ-
ing campaign to President Obama, urg-
ing ‘‘the U.S. must supply Ukraine 
with the means to defend itself’’ 
against 
Russian 
aggression, 
urging 
President Obama to quickly approve 
additional efforts to support Ukraine’s 
efforts to defend the sovereign terri-
tory, including the transfer of lethal 
defense weapons to the Ukraine mili-
tary. 
On March 23, the House of Represent-
atives overwhelmingly passed a resolu-
tion urging President Obama to imme-
diately exercise the authority by Con-
gress to provide Ukraine with a lethal 
defensive weapons system. 
The very next day, this Senate 
passed a unanimous resolution urging 
the President to prioritize and expedite 
the provision of defensive lethal and 
nonlethal 
military 
assistance 
to 
Ukraine, consistent with U.S. national 
interests and policies. 
As one Senator here stated in March 
2015, ‘‘Providing nonlethal equipment 
like night vision goggles is all well and 
good, but giving the Ukrainians the 
ability to see the Russians coming but 
not the ability to stop them is not the 
answer.’’ 
Yet President Obama refused. He re-
fused even in the face of support by 
senior 
career 
professionals 
recom-
mending he provide lethal weapons to 
the Ukrainians. 
By contrast, what did President 
Zelensky and the Russians know? They 
knew that President Trump did—did— 
provide that support. That, clearly, 
was the most material thing to him, 
much more important than a meeting 
in the Oval Office. 
The House managers also made much 
of 
the 
contention 
that 
President 
Trump supposedly wanted President 
Zelensky only to announce an inves-
tigation, not conduct it, but that con-
tention makes no sense. President 
Trump’s call with President Zelensky 
was in July of 2019—almost a year and 
a half before our next election. Would 
only a bare announcement so far in ad-
vance, with no followup, really have 
had any effect on the election, as the 
managers claim? Would anyone have 
remembered the announcement a year 
or more later? 
Ironically, it is the House managers 
who have put Burisma and its connec-
tion to the Bidens front and center in 
this proceeding, and now the voters 
will know about it and probably will 
remember it. Be careful what you wish 
for. 
Manager SCHIFF—well, there he goes 
again. He is putting words in the Presi-
dent’s mouth that were never there. 
Again, look at the transcript of the 
July call. President Trump never asked 
about any announcement of any type 
of 
investigation, 
and 
President 
Zelensky told President Trump: 
I guarantee, as the President of Ukraine, 
that all the investigations will be done open-
ly and candidly. That I can assure you. 
What happened next? 
The House managers say President 
Zelensky did not want to get mixed up

January 27, 2020 
in U.S. politics, but it is precisely the 
Democrats who politicized the issue. 
Last August, they began circling the 
wagons in trying to protect Vice Presi-
dent Biden, and they are still doing it 
in these proceedings. They contend 
that any investigation into the mil-
lions of dollars of payments by a cor-
rupt Ukraine company—owned by a 
corrupt Ukraine oligarch—to the son of 
the second highest officeholder in our 
land, who was supposed to be in charge 
of fighting corruption in Ukraine, to be 
a sham, debunked. But there has never 
been an investigation, so how could it 
be a sham—simply because the House 
managers say so? 
Which brings me to yet another one 
of the House managers’ baseless con-
tentions—that President Trump raised 
the matter with President Zelensky be-
cause Vice President Biden had just an-
nounced his candidacy for President. 
But, of course, it was far from a secret 
that Vice President Biden was planning 
to run. 
What had, in fact, changed? 
First, President Zelensky had been 
elected in April on an anti-corruption 
platform. In July, running on the same 
platform, his party took control of the 
Ukrainian Parliament. That made it 
the opportune time to raise the issue 
because finally there was a receptive 
government in Ukraine that was com-
mitted to fighting precisely the kind of 
highly questionable conduct displayed 
by Burisma in its payments to Hunter 
Biden and his partner, just as Joe 
Biden had raised years before. 
There are two other things. 
In late June, ABC News ran a story enti-
tled ‘‘Hunter Biden’s foreign deals. Did Joe 
Biden’s son profit off of his father’s position 
as Vice President?’’ 
Then, just a couple of weeks before 
President Trump’s telephone call with 
President Zelensky, the New Yorker 
magazine—not exactly a supporter of 
President Trump’s—ran an expose— 
‘‘Will Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Fa-
ther’s Campaign?’’—and went through 
some of the facts that we do know 
about Hunter Biden’s involvement with 
Burisma and his involvement with the 
Chinese company. 
The New Yorker reporter—again, this 
was in July, just a couple of weeks be-
fore the phone call—said that some of 
Vice President Biden’s advisers were 
worried that Hunter would expose the 
Vice President to criticism. 
A former senior White House aide 
told the New Yorker reporter that 
Hunter’s behavior invited questions 
about whether he was ‘‘leveraging ac-
cess for his benefit.’’ The reporter 
wrote: ‘‘When I asked members of 
Biden’s staff whether they did raise 
their concern with the Vice President, 
several of them said they had been too 
intimidated to do so.’’ 
‘‘Everyone who works for him has 
been screamed at,’’ a former adviser 
told the reporter. ‘‘I don’t know wheth-
er anyone has been intimidated by Vice 
President Biden or has been screamed 
at by him about Burisma or his son’s 
involvement.’’ 
Do we want the type of government 
where questions about facially suspect 
conduct are suppressed or dismissed as 
illegitimate because someone is intimi-
dating or screams or is just too impor-
tant? No. That is precisely when an in-
vestigation is most important. 
Last 
Thursday 
night, 
Manager 
JEFFRIES provided us with the Demo-
crats’ standard for abuse of power. 
He said: ‘‘Abuse of power occurs when 
the President exercises his official 
power to obtain a corrupt personal ben-
efit while ignoring or injuring the na-
tional interest.’’ 
Mr. JEFFRIES and the House man-
agers contend that, under this stand-
ard, President Trump has committed 
an impeachable offense and must be 
immediately removed from office. But 
if Manager JEFFRIES’ standard applies, 
then where were these same Demo-
crats’ calls for impeachment when 
uncontroverted, smoking-gun evidence 
emerged that President Obama had vio-
lated their standard? 
The American people understand this 
basic notion as equal justice under the 
law. It is as American as apple pie. Yet 
the House managers want to apply 
their own version of selective justice 
here, which applies only to their polit-
ical opponents. They want one system 
of justice for Democrats and another 
system of justice for everyone else. 
You do not need to take my word for it; 
let’s walk through the facts. 
On March 26, 2012, on the eve of the 
2012 
Nuclear 
Security 
Summit 
in 
Seoul, South Korea, President Obama 
met with Russian President Dmitry 
Medvedev to discuss one of the pressing 
issues in the U.S. national security in-
terests—missile defense. 
How important was the issue of mis-
sile defense to the strategic relation-
ship between the United States and 
Russia? 
As President Obama’s Defense Sec-
retary Robert Gates said in June 2010, 
upgraded missile interceptors in devel-
opment ‘‘would give us the ability to 
protect our troops, our bases, our fa-
cilities and our allies in Europe.’’ 
Gates continued: 
There is no meeting of the minds on mis-
sile defense. The Russians hate it. They have 
hated it since the late 1960s. They will al-
ways hate it, mostly because we will build it, 
and they won’t. 
During the Nuclear Security Sum-
mit, President Obama had a private ex-
change 
with 
Russian 
President 
Medvedev that was picked up on a hot 
microphone. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President OBAMA. This is my last elec-
tion. After my election, I have more flexi-
bility. 
President MEDVEDEV. I understand. I will 
transmit this information to Vladimir, and I 
stand with you. 
President Obama said: 
On all these issues, but particularly mis-
sile defense, this can be solved, but it’s im-
portant for him to give me space. 
President Medvedev responded: 
Yeah, I understand. I understand your mes-
sage about space. Space for you. 
President Obama: 
This is my last election. After my election, 
I will have more flexibility. 
President Medvedev responds: 
I understand. I will transmit this informa-
tion to Vladimir. 
As we all know, it is Vladimir Putin. 
As you just saw in 2012, President 
Obama asked the Russians for space 
until after the upcoming 2012 election, 
after which he would have more flexi-
bility. 
Now, let me apply Mr. JEFFRIES’ and 
the House managers’ three-part test for 
abuse of power. 
One, the President exercises his offi-
cial power. President Obama’s actions 
clearly meet the test for exercising of-
ficial power because in his role as head 
of state during the nuclear security 
summit, 
after 
asking 
President 
Medvedev for space, he promised him 
that ‘‘missile defense can be solved.’’ 
What else did that mean but solved in 
a way favorable to the Russians, who 
were dead set against the expansion of 
a U.S. missile defense system in Eu-
rope? 
Two, to obtain a corrupt personal 
benefit. 
President 
Obama’s 
actions 
were clearly for his own corrupt per-
sonal benefit because he was asking an 
adversary for space for the express pur-
pose of furthering his own election 
chances. 
Again, President Obama said: 
This is my last election. After my election, 
I have more flexibility. 
President Obama knew the impor-
tance of missile defense in Europe but 
decided to use that as a bargaining 
chip with the Russians to further his 
own election chances in 2012. 
Three, while ignoring or injuring our 
national 
interest. 
As 
President 
Obama’s Defense Secretary said, ‘‘Mis-
siles would give us the ability to pro-
tect our troops, our bases, our facili-
ties, and our allies in Europe.’’ 
Surely, sacrificing the ability to pro-
tect our troops and our allies would in-
jure the national interest. Yet Presi-
dent Obama was willing to barter away 
the safety of our troops and the safety 
of our allies in exchange for space in 
the upcoming election. 
In short, President Obama leveraged 
the power of his office to the detriment 
of U.S. policy on missile defense in 
order to influence the 2012 election 
solely to his advantage. And we never 
would 
have 
known 
had 
President 
Obama realized that the microphone 
was on; that there was a hot mic. 
One could easily substitute President 
Obama’s 2012 exchange with President 
Medvedev into article I of the House’s 
Impeachment Articles against Presi-
dent Trump. 
Using the powers of his high office, 
President Obama solicited interference 
of a foreign government, Russia, in the 
2012 U.S. Presidential election. He did 
so through a scheme or course of con-
duct that included soliciting the Gov-
ernment of Russia to give him ‘‘space’’ 
on missile defense that would benefit

his reelection and influence the 2012 
U.S. Presidential election to his advan-
tage. 
In doing so, President Obama used 
the powers of the Presidency in a man-
ner that compromised the national se-
curity of the United States and under-
mined the integrity of the U.S. demo-
cratic process. He thus ignored and in-
jured the interest of the Nation. 
Does it sound familiar, House man-
agers? It should, as the case against 
President Obama would have been far 
stronger than the allegations against 
President Trump. 
President Obama’s abuse of power to 
benefit his own political interests was 
there and is here now for everyone to 
hear. It was a direct, unquestionable 
quid pro quo. No mind reading was 
needed there. Where were the House 
managers then? 
And that points out the absurdity of 
the House managers’ case against 
President Trump. It was President 
Obama, not President Trump, who was 
weak on Russia and weak on support to 
Ukraine. 
President Obama caved to Russia and 
Putin on missile defense when he de-
cided to scrap the U.S. plans to install 
missile bases in Poland. Yet he criti-
cized Senator ROMNEY during the 2012 
Presidential campaign when Senator 
ROMNEY said Russia was the greatest 
geopolitical threat to the U.S. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President OBAMA. I’m glad that you rec-
ognize that al-Qaida’s a threat because a few 
months ago when you were asked what’s the 
biggest geopolitical threat facing America, 
you said Russia. Not al-Qaida, you said Rus-
sia, and the 1980s are now calling to ask for 
their foreign policy back because, you know, 
the Cold War’s been over for 20 years. 
Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Now, 
when it is politically convenient, the 
Democrats are saying the same thing 
that President Obama criticized Sen-
ator ROMNEY for saying. In fact, they 
are basing their entire politicized im-
peachment on this inversion of reality, 
this claim that President Trump is not 
supporting Ukraine far more than the 
prior administration. 
President Obama caved on missile de-
fense in late 2009. His hot mic moment 
occurred in March 2012. His reelection 
was 8 months later. Two years later, in 
March 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine 
and annexed Crimea. President Obama 
refused to provide lethal aid to Ukraine 
to enable it to defend itself. Where 
were the House managers then? 
The House managers would have the 
American people believe that there is a 
threat—an imminent threat—to the 
national security of our country for 
which the President must be removed 
immediately from the highest office in 
the land because of what? Because he 
had a phone call with a foreign leader 
and discussed corruption? Because he 
paused for a short period of time giving 
away our tax dollars to a foreign coun-
try? That is their theory. 
It is absurd on its face. Not one 
American life was in jeopardy or lost 
by this short delay, and they know it. 
And how do we know that they know 
it? Because they went on vacation 
after they adopted the Articles of Im-
peachment. They did not cancel their 
recess. They did not rush back to de-
liver the Articles of Impeachment to 
the Senate because of this supposed 
terrible imminent threat to our na-
tional security. What did they do? 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Speaker PELOSI. Urgency. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Timing is really driven by 
the urgency. 
Mr. SWALWELL. The urgency. 
Mr. NADLER. Nothing could be more ur-
gent. 
Mr. RICHMOND. The urgency. 
Speaker PELOSI. And urgent. And urgent. 
Mr. SWALWELL. There is an urgency, you 
know, to this. 
Mr. NADLER. Then we must move swiftly. 
Mr. SWALWELL. We don’t have time to 
screw around. 
Speaker PELOSI. It’s about urgency. 
Mr. 
TAPPER. 
House 
Speaker 
NANCY 
PELOSI is still holding on to the Articles of 
Impeachment. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
HERSCHMANN. 
Ur-
gency? Urgency, for which you want to 
immediately remove the President of 
the United States? You sat on the arti-
cles for a month—the longest delay in 
the history of our country. 
They adopted them on Friday, De-
cember 13, 2019—Friday the 13th—went 
on vacation, and finally decided after 
one of their Democratic Presidential 
debates had finished and after the BCS 
football championship game, that it 
was time to deliver them. 
What happened to their national se-
curity interest argument? Wasn’t that 
the reason that they said they had to 
rush to vote? It is urgent, they told us. 
No due process for this President. It is 
a crisis of monumental proportion. Our 
national security is at risk every addi-
tional day that he is in office, they tell 
us. 
The House managers also used the 
same excuse for not issuing subpoenas 
for testimony. They had no time for 
the normal judicial review. They even 
complained about the judicial review 
process sitting in this Chamber before 
the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme 
Court—a judicial review in which the 
judge agreed to an expedited schedule. 
Even that was not good enough for 
them when they issued the subpoenas. 
One of the lawyers for the subpoe-
naed witnesses wrote to the House gen-
eral counsel: ‘‘We are dismayed that 
the House committees have chosen not 
to join us in seeking resolution from 
the judicial branch of this momentous 
constitutional 
question 
as 
expedi-
tiously as possible.’’ 
He continued: ‘‘It is important to get 
a definitive judgment from the judicial 
branch 
determining 
their 
constitu-
tional duty in the place of conflicting 
demands of the legislative and execu-
tive branches.’’ 
Isn’t that the point? Isn’t that how 
our system of government works? Isn’t 
that how it has always worked? Isn’t 
that how it is supposed to work? 
These 
same 
Democrats 
defended 
other administrations who fought judi-
cial review of congressional subpoenas, 
and I think we all remember Fast and 
Furious. 
The same attorney, when he wrote to 
the House chair, said: 
The House chairmen, Mr. SCHIFF and Mr. 
NADLER, are mistaken to say the lawsuit is 
intended to delay or otherwise obstruct the 
committees’ vital investigatory work. 
He continued: 
Nor has this lawsuit been coordinated in 
any way with the White House any more 
than it has been coordinated with the House 
of Representatives. If the House chooses not 
to pursue through subpoenaed testimony, let 
the record be clear that is the House’s deci-
sion, if they come before you and they blame 
the administration and they blame you if 
you don’t subpoena witnesses and have them 
before you. 
Yet even in the face of this over-
whelming evidence, they claim that 
the President is to blame for their deci-
sion to withdraw their own subpoenas 
or not issue others. Their choice, but 
the President is responsible. That is 
one of their claims. It is ludicrous. 
They are blaming the President be-
cause they decided on their own not to 
seek judicial review and enforcement 
of their own subpoenas and for some 
witnesses never even issued subpoenas. 
In their minds, that is impeachable. 
Manager NADLER
spoke eloquently 
back before the House Judiciary Com-
mittee hearing in December of 1998. He 
said: 
There must never be a narrowly voted im-
peachment or an impeachment substantially 
supported by one of our major political par-
ties and largely opposed by the other. Such 
an impeachment would lack legitimacy, 
would produce divisiveness and bitterness in 
our politics for years to come, and will call 
into question the very legitimacy of our po-
litical institutions. 
Manager NADLER was right then, and 
it is equally true today. Divisiveness 
and bitterness. Divisiveness and bitter-
ness. Listen to his words. 
Impeachments by one party cause di-
visiveness and bitterness in our coun-
try. That is what a partisan impeach-
ment leads to. 
Sadly, when Manager NADLER
elo-
quently warned against divisiveness 
and bitterness, the House did not fol-
low his admonition. They did not heed 
his advice, and that is one of the rea-
sons we are sitting here today with Ar-
ticles of Impeachment that are not 
found in our Constitution or the evi-
dence and are brought simply for par-
tisan politics. 
This is a sad time for all of us. This 
is not a time to give out souvenirs, the 
pens used to sign two Articles of Im-
peachment, trying to improperly im-
peach our country’s representative to 
the world. 
This is not the time to try to get digs 
in that the President will always be 
impeached because we had the major-
ity and we could do it to you and we 
did it to you. It is wrong. It is not what 
the American people deserve or want. 
Sadly, the House managers do not 
trust their fellow Americans to choose 
their own President. They do not think

that they can legitimately win an elec-
tion against President Trump, so they 
need to rush to impeach him imme-
diately. That is what they have contin-
ually told the American people, and 
that—that is a shame. 
We, on the other hand, trust our fel-
low Americans to choose their Presi-
dent. Choose your candidate. Let the 
Senators who are here who are trying 
to become the Democratic nominee try 
to win that election, and let the Amer-
ican people choose. 
Maybe—maybe they are concerned 
that the American people like histori-
cally low unemployment. Maybe the 
American people like that their 401(k) 
accounts have done extremely well. 
Maybe the American people like prison 
reform and giving people a second 
chance. 
Tellingly, some of these House man-
agers worked constructively with this 
administration to give Americans a 
second chance. That was the public in-
terest. That is what the country de-
mands. That is what society deserves. 
Maybe the American people like an 
administration that is fighting the 
opioid epidemic. Maybe the American 
people like secure borders. Maybe the 
American people like better trade 
agreements with our biggest trading 
partners. Maybe the American people 
like other countries sharing in the bur-
den when it comes to foreign aid. 
Maybe the American people actually 
like low taxes. In other words, maybe 
the American people like their current 
President—a President who has kept 
his promises and delivered on them. 
If you think Americans want to 
abandon our prosperity and our unprec-
edented successes under this President, 
then convince the electorate in Novem-
ber at the ballot box. Do not try to im-
properly interfere with an election that 
is only months away, based on these 
Articles of Impeachment. 
In your trial memorandum that you 
submitted here before the Senate, you 
speak about the Framers of the Con-
stitution 
believing 
that 
President 
Trump’s 
alleged 
conduct 
is 
their 
‘‘worst 
nightmare’’ 
and 
that 
they 
would be horrified. 
In fact, sadly, sadly, it is the House 
managers’ conduct in bringing these 
baseless Articles of Impeachment that 
would clearly be their and our worst 
nightmare. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I think we are looking at a 45-minute 
break for dinner. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate stand in recess. 
There being no objection, at 6:01 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 6:48 p.m., 
and thereupon reassembled when called 
to order by the CHIEF JUSTICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will come to order. Ready to proceed? 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the 
Senate, House managers, we are going 
to do two things this evening. We are 
going to first hear from former inde-
pendent counsel Robert Ray. He is 
going to discuss issues of how he was 
involved in the investigation, the legal 
issues, some of the history of how that 
works, and then we will conclude this 
evening with a presentation from Pro-
fessor Dershowitz. 
With that, I yield my time, Mr. Chief 
Justice, to Robert Ray. 
Mr. Counsel RAY. Mr. Chief Justice, 
Members of the Senate, distinguished 
House managers, and may it please this 
Court of Impeachment, I stand before 
you today in defense of my fellow 
Americans, who in November 2016 
elected Donald Trump to serve the peo-
ple as their President. Their reasons 
for that vote were as varied as any im-
portant decisions are, but their collec-
tive judgment, accepted as legitimate 
under our Constitution, is deserving of 
my respect and yours. 
For only the third time in our Na-
tion’s history, the Senate is convened 
to try the President of the United 
States on Articles of Impeachment. 
Those articles do not allege crimes. 
The Constitution, the Framers’ intent, 
and historical practice all dictate that 
well-founded Articles of Impeachment 
allege both that a high crime has been 
committed, and that, as such, removal 
from office is warranted only when 
such an offense also constitutes an 
abuse of the public trust; that is, in the 
case of the President, a violation of his 
oath of office. Both are required and 
neither one, by clear and unmistakable 
evidence, is shown here by these Arti-
cles of Impeachment. 
I am here this evening in this Cham-
ber distinctly privileged to represent 
and defend the President of the United 
States on the facts, on the law, and on 
the constitutional principles that must 
be paramount to you, Members of the 
Senate, in deciding the great question 
of whether these articles warrant, with 
or without witnesses, the removal of 
the President from office. 
Because there is and can be no basis 
in these articles on which the Senate 
can or should convict a President on 
what is alleged, the President must not 
be removed from office. That judgment 
is reserved to the people in the ordi-
nary course of elections, the next of 
which is just over 9 months away. 
Now, 40 years ago, in 1980, I first 
came to Capitol Hill as a legislative in-
tern for a Congressman who only 6 
years earlier had played an important 
and critical role in the impeachment 
proceedings against President Richard 
Nixon. The Congressman of whom I 
speak, whom I came to respect im-
mensely, served then, in 1974, in the 
House Judiciary Committee. He was 
tasked in the summer of 1974, together 
with his colleagues, in evaluating and 
voting on, as most of the House man-
agers here have, Articles of Impeach-
ment. 
Those 
articles 
included 
the 
crime of obstruction of justice, abuse 
of power, and obstruction of Congress. 
But unlike how House managers—and, 
indeed, the entire House—45 years later 
in December 2019 proceeded here, bipar-
tisan consensus in 1974, among both 
House Democrats and House Repub-
licans, was the order of the day. In-
deed, it became apparent then, that 
narrow partisan views aside, the House 
Judiciary Committee would step into 
the breach only insofar as evidence of 
criminal 
Presidential 
conduct 
war-
ranted. 
The tapes of Oval Office conversa-
tions involving the President provided 
that evidence. The Supreme Court, in 
effect, overruled the claim of executive 
privilege and ordered the release of the 
tapes to the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
As a result, 3 days later, the high 
crime of obstruction of justice, includ-
ing suborning perjury tethered to a 
second Article of Impeachment 2 days 
after that, alleging abuse of power, was 
approved by the House Judiciary Com-
mittee by a vote of 27 to 11 and 28 to 10, 
respectively. 
The second Article of Impeachment 
alleged, among other things, unlawful 
use of the CIA and its resources, in-
cluding covert activity in the United 
States and interference with the law 
enforcement actions of the FBI to ad-
vance the coverup; that is, the criminal 
conspiracy to obstruct justice charge 
in the first Article of Impeachment. 
The crimes alleged were serious, in-
volving unlawful electronic surveil-
lance of an opposing political party, 
paying hush money out of a White 
House safe to burglars and other co-
conspirators to silence cooperation 
with law enforcement, and attempts to 
alter testimony under oath. 
Six 
Republican 
House 
committee 
members joined all 21 Democrats in 
supporting those two articles. My Con-
gressman was among those six Repub-
lican House Members. Another one of 
the six was then a young Congressman 
from Maine, who later became a Mem-
ber of this body, serving with distinc-
tion as a Senator and later as Presi-
dent Bill Clinton’s Secretary of De-
fense. That young Congressman was 
Bill Cohen. A third of the six was Rep-
resentative Caldwell Butler, a Repub-
lican from Virginia, whose papers are 
housed at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity in Lexington, VA, in the State 
where I grew up and where I later went 
to law school. 
Together, these six Republicans made 
history. They did so with no sense of 
triumph—in today’s parlance, no fist 
bumps—but in the words of my Con-
gressman, only ‘‘with deep reluctance’’ 
and only because the evidence was 
clear and unmistakable of unlawful ac-
tivities by the President in a criminal 
coverup that was—in the concluding 
language of the first Article of Im-
peachment—‘‘contrary to his trust as 
President.’’ 
As to the third article in the Nixon 
impeachment, that article charging ob-
struction of Congress did not enjoy bi-
partisan support but instead was voted

January 27, 2020 
on by the House Judiciary Committee 
along party lines by a vote of 21 to 17. 
Republicans objected then to the third 
article in the face of the President’s 
good-faith prior claim to executive 
privilege by withholding certain evi-
dence until such time as the matter 
was definitively resolved by the Su-
preme Court. 
My point in mentioning these three 
votes by the House Judiciary Com-
mittee is simply this: Count votes, and 
do the math. I understand that you all 
have been deprived of your phones and, 
thus, a calculator app, so I will do it 
for you. 
A 27-to-11 vote was not only bipar-
tisan, as I have indicated, but over-
whelmingly so—indeed, over 70 percent; 
that is to say, greater than a two- 
thirds supermajority. 
That vote sent a powerful signal to 
the full House and indeed the Senate 
that impeachment was overwhelmingly 
bipartisan and, therefore, politically 
and legally legitimate. 
President Nixon’s fate was sealed, 
and the result was inevitable. Thus, 
less than 2 weeks after that initial 
committee vote on impeachment, the 
President resigned. 
During the course of those pro-
ceedings, my Congressman commented 
simply and plainly that it was, in his 
words, ‘‘a great American tragedy.’’ 
But the greater point was—and is—that 
impeachment was never designed or in-
tended to be a partisan tool and was to 
be undertaken only as a last resort. 
This then brings me to what was in-
tended by the Framers of the Constitu-
tion relative to impeachment. That 
subject will be addressed at some 
length 
by 
my 
colleague 
Professor 
Dershowitz, but, for now, let me just 
say that much has been said by House 
managers in reliance on Alexander 
Hamilton’s oft-quoted statement in 
Federalist No. 65. That is the one re-
peatedly taken out of context and cited 
in favor of an expansive scope of juris-
diction by Congress over alleged of-
fenses. 
In Hamilton’s words, ‘‘which proceed 
from misconduct of [a] public [official 
constituting] the abuse of or violation 
of some public trust.’’ The irony that 
Hamilton—the greatest proponent in 
this country of executive and Presi-
dential authority that perhaps ever 
lived—should be front and center in 
this partisan impeachment effort to re-
move a duly elected President from of-
fice is apparently lost on House im-
peachment managers. I dare say that 
Hamilton would roll over in his grave 
at the end of Wall Street in New York 
City to know that, contrary to what he 
explicitly acknowledged in Federalist 
No. 69, a President can only be removed 
from office ‘‘upon conviction of trea-
son, bribery, or other high crimes or 
misdemeanors.’’ We should just read 
the word ‘‘crime’’ right out of the im-
peachment clause of the Constitution 
and proceed merrily along the way to-
ward an impeachment trial, with wit-
nesses, no less, of a President duly 
elected by the people. And for what? 
Articles of Impeachment that do not 
even allege crimes. 
President 
Trump 
is 
right. 
That 
course, if sustained, cheapens the im-
peachment process and, thus, is an 
American tragedy all its own. 
Indeed, during the impeachment trial 
21 years ago in January 1999, none 
other than President Clinton’s highly 
respected White House Counsel Charles 
Ruff stated it best: ‘‘To argue then, as 
the managers do, that the phrase 
‘other high crimes and misdemeanors’ 
was really meant to encompass a wide 
range of offenses . . . simply flies in 
the face of the clear intent of the fram-
ers, who carefully chose their lan-
guage, knew exactly what those words 
meant and knew exactly what risk 
they intended to promote against.’’ 
Counsel Ruff went on to explain: One 
of those concerns and risks was that 
‘‘impeachment be limited and well de-
fined.’’ 
For our purposes here, what is re-
quired is both that crimes be alleged 
and that those crimes be of the type 
that, in particular, are so serious that 
they—again, in Mr. Ruff’s words—‘‘sub-
vert our system of government and 
would justify overturning a popular 
election.’’ Otherwise, what you have— 
in Tocqueville’s words—is legislative 
tyranny. 
I respectfully submit, Members of the 
Senate, taken in its proper context, 
that is what Alexander Hamilton well 
understood and meant, and so did my 
Congressman. That Congressman was, 
of course, Hamilton Fish, Jr. Actually, 
he was not really a junior but Ham-
ilton Fish IV. His great-grandfather 
was also Hamilton Fish, who was born 
in 1808, later served as Governor of New 
York, a U.S. Senator immediately be-
fore the Civil War, and, notably, as 
President Ulysses Grant’s Secretary of 
State. But at the time back in 1980, 
what I didn’t realize—even though now, 
perhaps, it is so obvious—the original 
Hamilton Fish was named after his 
parents’ best friend, none other than 
Alexander Hamilton himself. 
What Congressman Hamilton Fish, 
from the Watergate era, courageously 
understood is the same historical les-
son that Jeffrey A. Engel, founding di-
rector of the Center for Presidential 
History at Southern Methodist Univer-
sity, has written about in a coauthored 
2018 book on impeachment: 
The charge must be treason, bribery 
or 
other 
high 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors. It must be one for which 
clear and unmistakable proof can be 
produced. Only if the evidence actually 
produced against the President is in-
deed irrefutable such that his own con-
stituents—in this case, the 63 million 
people, like me, who voted for Presi-
dent Trump—accept his guilt of the of-
fense charged in order to overwhelm-
ingly persuade a supermajority of 
Americans, and, thus, their Senators, 
of malfeasance, warranting his removal 
from office. 
And, finally, because it is the Presi-
dent of the United States, after all, 
that we are talking about here, the re-
pository of and entrusted under the 
Constitution with all of the executive 
power of the United States—in other 
words, an entire branch of govern-
ment—removal from office cannot be 
based upon an impeachable offense or 
offenses which are, in essence, nothing 
more 
than—paraphrasing 
President 
Gerald Ford now—whatever a partisan 
majority of the House of Representa-
tives considers them to be. 
To supplement that cited statement 
50 years ago, in 1970, from then-Con-
gressman Jerry Ford in connection 
with the prospect of potentially im-
peaching a Supreme Court Justice, 
Ford pointedly clarified that executive 
branch impeachments are different be-
cause voters can remove the President, 
the Vice President, and all persons 
holding office at their pleasure at least 
every 4 years. To remove a President in 
midterm—it has been tried before and 
never done—would indeed, he said, re-
quire crimes of the magnitude of trea-
son and bribery. 
Professor Akhil Amar of Yale Law 
School made largely the same point 
during the Clinton impeachment about 
the danger presented through Presi-
dential impeachment of transforming 
an entire branch of government: 
When they remove a duly elected Presi-
dent, they undo the votes of millions of ordi-
nary Americans on Election Day. This is not 
something that Senators should do lightly, 
lest we slide toward a kind of parliamentary 
government that our entire structure of gov-
ernment was designed to repudiate. 
In hammering home the constitu-
tional uniqueness of Presidential im-
peachments, he emphasized the case of 
Richard Nixon and distinguished it 
from Andrew Johnson; that is to say, 
only when extremely high crimes and 
gross abuses of official power indeed 
pose a threat to our basic constitu-
tional system, a threat as high and 
truly as malignant to democratic gov-
ernment as treason and bribery, he rea-
soned, would the Senate ever be justi-
fied in nullifying the votes of millions 
of Americans and removing a President 
from office. 
My point is this: History—our Amer-
ican history—matters. To listen to how 
the House managers would have it, Ar-
ticles of Impeachment are merely—as 
Chuck Ruff warned a generation ago— 
empty vessels into which can be poured 
any number of charges, even those con-
sidered and abandoned. 
At least in the case of President Clin-
ton’s impeachment, the articles actu-
ally charged crimes. The Senate there-
after determined, by its vote in that 
case, 
in 
effect, 
that 
while 
those 
crimes—perjury and obstruction of jus-
tice—may have been committed, those 
crimes were not high enough crimes 
damaging to the body politic to war-
rant the President’s removal from of-
fice. 
That judgment was, of course, within 
this body’s discretion to render, and it 
has been accepted as such by the coun-
try—whether you agreed with it or

not—as legitimate. It is also one that 
is historically consistent with Hamil-
ton’s views and Madison’s, too, con-
cerning the proper scope of impeach-
ment as applied to a President. 
When I entered the scene and suc-
ceeded my colleague and cocounsel 
here, Judge Kenneth Starr, as inde-
pendent counsel in October of 1999, it 
was left for me to decide whether pros-
ecution of President Clinton following 
impeachment, nonetheless, was war-
ranted, consistent with the Depart-
ment of Justice’s Principles of Federal 
Prosecution. That matter was exhaus-
tively considered in the midst of a Fed-
eral grand jury investigation that I 
commissioned in order to decide, first, 
whether crimes, in fact, had been com-
mitted. I found that they had, and I 
later said so publicly in the final report 
expressly authorized and mandated by 
Congress concluding the Lewinsky in-
vestigation. 
Significantly, though, I also deter-
mined that the prosecution of the 
President, while in, or once he left of-
fice, would not be in the national inter-
est, given alternative available means, 
short of prosecution, in order to hold 
the President accountable for his con-
duct. Those means included a written 
acknowledgement by the President 2 
years after his Senate trial that his 
testimony under oath before the grand 
jury had, in fact, been false and a re-
lated agreement to suspend his law li-
cense. 
The price paid by President Clinton 
was indeed high, and it stemmed, in 
the end, from the need to vindicate the 
principle, first raised most promi-
nently during Watergate, that no per-
son, including the President, is above 
the law. 
Despite President Clinton’s subse-
quent protestation in his memoirs that 
I was just another Federal prosecutor 
out to extract, in his words, a pound of 
flesh, I credit the President to this day 
with agreeing to do what was necessary 
in order to exercise my discretion not 
to prosecute; namely, that for the good 
of the country and recognizing the 
unique place that the President—in-
deed, any President—occupies in our 
constitutional government, account-
ability and discretion go hand in hand 
and 
permitted—indeed, 
demanded— 
such an appropriate resolution. It en-
abled the country to move on, and it 
was as much, if not more, a credit to 
Bill Clinton than to any credit I re-
ceived or deserved that we were able to 
reach agreement and avoid any further 
partisan recriminations or interference 
with the will of the American people in 
electing and reelecting President Clin-
ton in the first place—and his suc-
cessor, President George W. Bush. 
In short, I was absolutely mindful 
and exceedingly concerned throughout 
my tenure as independent counsel that, 
although crimes had been committed, 
Bill Clinton was the elected official 
placed in office by voters throughout 
the Nation and head of the executive 
branch, and I was not. 
The lesson for me was a simple one 
that I am sure every American citizen, 
whatever their own experience or polit-
ical perspective, can understand: Be 
humble and act with humility. Never 
be too sure that you are right. 
Today, 20 years later, what have we 
learned from that experience? I fear 
that the answer to that question is 
nothing at all. If these Impeachment 
Articles now are sustained beyond 
summary resolution in favor of acquit-
tal, impeachment in the future lit-
erally will mean not only that proof of 
high crimes is no longer necessary to 
sustain the effort but that no crime at 
all is sufficient so long as a partisan 
majority in the House says so. 
Thus, during the past 4 months alone, 
we have witnessed the endless proces-
sion of legal theories used to sustain 
this partisan impeachment—from trea-
son to quid pro quo, to bribery, to ex-
tortion, to obstruction of justice, to so-
liciting an illegal foreign campaign 
contribution, to a violation of the Im-
poundment Control Act—to who knows 
what all is next. 
What you are left with, then, are con-
stitutionally deficient articles aban-
doning any pretense of the need to al-
lege crimes that are another vehicle or 
weapon, if you will, in order to damage 
the President politically in an election 
year. 
It is, I submit, decidedly not in the 
country’s best interest to have the 
prosecution of the grave issue of im-
peachment and the drastic prospect of 
removal from office become just poli-
tics by other means, any more than it 
would be appropriate for the huge 
power of prosecution of offenses under 
the Federal Criminal Code to be exer-
cised not on the merits, without fear or 
favor, but instead as a raw, naked, and 
pernicious exercise of partisan power 
and advantage. 
I have spent the better part of my 
professional life, for over 30 years—as a 
Federal prosecutor for 13 years through 
two independent counsel investigations 
and now as a defense lawyer for over 17 
years—trying my level best always to 
ensure that politics and prosecution do 
not mix. It must not happen here. A 
standardless and partisan impeach-
ment is illegitimate and should be re-
jected as such overwhelmingly by this 
body, I hope and submit, or alter-
natively and, if need be, by only a par-
tisan 
Republican 
majority—for 
the 
good of the country. 
Turning now to what the House man-
agers have alleged, regarding the first 
article, the House Judiciary Com-
mittee report on impeachment con-
tains a rather extraordinary state-
ment. It says as follows: ‘‘Although 
President Trump’s actions need not 
rise to the level of a criminal violation 
to justify impeachment, his conduct 
here was criminal.’’ So, in short, we 
needn’t bother in an Impeachment Ar-
ticle charging the President with a 
crime, 
implicitly 
recognizing 
that 
there is insufficient evidence to prove 
that such a crime was committed, but 
we are going to say that the Presi-
dent’s conduct was criminal nonethe-
less. Aside from being exceedingly un-
fair to call something criminal and not 
stand behind the allegation and actu-
ally charge it, it just ain’t so. 
I have heard House Manager HAKEEM 
JEFFRIES argue before this body that 
he and his team have overwhelming 
evidence of an explicit—his word, not 
mine—quid pro quo by the President; 
that is, an explicit, purported, and pro-
posed exchange by President Trump of 
something of personal benefit to him-
self in return for an official act by the 
U.S. Government. 
As I have explained as far back as 
November of last year in a TIME maga-
zine cover story, the problem with this 
legal theory is that an unlawful quid 
pro quo is limited to those arrange-
ments that are corrupt; that is to say, 
only those that are clearly and unmis-
takably improper are therefore illegal. 
And, in the eyes of the law, the spe-
cific, measurable benefit that an inves-
tigation—or even the announcement of 
an investigation—against the Bidens 
might bring President Trump is, at 
best, nebulous. 
I should add here also that any effort 
to contend that this purported thing of 
value also constitutes an illegal for-
eign campaign contribution to the 
President of the United States is 
fraught with doubt as a matter of law. 
Indeed, the Justice Department has 
said as much. So, too, have courts 
which have struggled since at least the 
early 1990s with application of the Fed-
eral anticorruption laws to situations 
like this when an in-kind benefit in the 
form of campaign interference or as-
sistance is alleged to be illegal. None of 
this would permit the requisite finding 
supported by clear and unmistakable 
evidence of a violation of law necessary 
to sustain impeachment as an abuse of 
power. 
But back to Manager JEFFRIES’ con-
tention, proof of an explicit quid pro 
quo by the President—which, par-
enthetically, as previously noted by 
Mr. Cipollone, is nowhere to be found 
in the Articles of Impeachment—would 
have required a very different tele-
phone call than the one President 
Trump actually had with Ukraine 
President Zelensky. As I tried to ex-
plain in the TIME magazine piece, an 
explicit quid pro quo for alleged im-
proper campaign interference would 
have had President Trump saying to 
his counterpart in Ukraine, in words or 
substance, ‘‘Here is the deal,’’ and fol-
lowed up by explicitly linking a de-
mand for an investigation of the Bidens 
to the provision or release of foreign 
aid. None of that was said or ever hap-
pened. The call transcript itself dem-
onstrates that beyond any doubt. In 
the President’s words, read the tran-
script. 
By the way, the demand character-
ization apparently creeps into this 
phone call largely as the result of 
Army LTC Alexander Vindman’s testi-
mony where he equates a request based

upon his military experience, and hav-
ing listened in on the call, by a supe-
rior officer—in this case, the Com-
mander in Chief—as the same thing as 
an order in the chain of command. 
While all of this may be true in the 
military, it goes without saying that 
President Zelensky, as the leader and 
head of a sovereign nation, was not and 
is not in our military chain of com-
mand. 
I say that to you, Members of the 
Senate, as the son of a U.S. Army colo-
nel and Vietnam war veteran buried in 
Arlington National Cemetery and as 
the father of a U.S. Army major cur-
rently serving with President Trump’s 
Space Force Command in Aurora, CO, 
near Denver. 
With all due respect, Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman’s testimony in this 
regard is at best, I submit to you, dis-
torted and unpersuasive. 
Next, the purported implicit link be-
tween foreign aid and the investiga-
tions, or the announcement of them, is 
weak. The most that Ambassador Gor-
don Sondland was able to give was his 
presumption that such a link likely ex-
isted, and that presumption was flatly 
contradicted by the President’s express 
denial of the existence of a quid pro 
quo to Ambassador Sondland as well as 
to Senator RON JOHNSON. 
The President was emphatic to Am-
bassador Sondland. The President said: 
I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I 
just want Zelensky to do the right thing, to 
do what he ran on. 
And to Senator JOHNSON, the same 
thing, just two words: ‘‘No way.’’ 
Recognizing this flaw in the testi-
mony, House managers have focused 
instead on an alternate quid pro quo 
rationale, that the exchange was condi-
tioned on a foreign head-of-state meet-
ing at the White House in return for 
Ukraine publicly announcing an inves-
tigation of the Bidens. 
In the House Judiciary report, it 
states as follows: ‘‘It is beyond ques-
tion that official White House visits 
constitute a ‘formal exercise of govern-
mental power’ within the meaning of 
McDonnell.’’ 
Not so fast. Actually, the Supreme 
Court in McDonnell helpfully boiled it 
down to only those acts that constitute 
the formal exercise of government 
power and that are more specific and 
focused than a broad policy objective. 
An exchange resulting in meetings, 
events, phone calls, as those terms are 
typically understood as being routine, 
according to the Supreme Court’s defi-
nition of an official act, do not count. 
The fact that the meeting involved 
was a formal one, with all of the 
trappings of a state visit by the Presi-
dent of Ukraine and hosted by the 
President of the United States, makes 
no difference. The Supreme Court is 
talking about an official act as a for-
mal exercise of decision-making power, 
not the formality of the visit. Even if 
the allegation were true, this could not 
constitute a quid pro quo. 
I should know. I argued, in effect, the 
contrary proposition in United States 
v. Sun-Diamond before the Supreme 
Court over 20 years ago in 1999. That 
proposition 
lost—unanimously. 
The 
vote was 9 to 0. 
In any event, the coveted meeting— 
and it was, after all, just a meeting, 
whether at the White House or not— 
was not permanently withheld. It later 
happened between the two Presidents 
at the United Nations in New York 
City at the first available opportunity 
in September 2019. 
Finally, the argument by Chairman 
JERRY NADLER that this call by Presi-
dent Trump with President Zelensky 
represented an ‘‘extortionate demand’’ 
is patently ridiculous. The essential 
element of the crime of extortion is 
pressure. No pressure was exercised or 
exerted during the call. Ukrainian offi-
cials, including President Zelensky 
himself, have since repeatedly denied 
that any such pressure existed. Indeed, 
to the contrary, the evidence strongly 
suggests Ukraine was perfectly capable 
of resisting any efforts to entangle 
itself in United States domestic party 
politics and partisanship. 
What, then, remains of the first Arti-
cle of Impeachment? No crimes were 
committed. Indeed, no crimes were 
even formally alleged. In that regard, 
what exactly is left? It is not treason. 
Ukraine is our ally, not our enemy or 
our adversary. And Russia is not our 
enemy, only our adversary. It is not 
bribery. There is no quid pro quo. It is 
not extortion—no pressure. 
It is not an illegal foreign campaign 
contribution. The benefit of the an-
nouncement of an investigation is not 
tangible enough to constitute an in- 
kind 
campaign 
contribution 
war-
ranting prosecution under Federal law. 
It is also not a violation of the Im-
poundment Control Act. Let’s take a 
look at that last one for a moment, 
shall we. The U.S. Government Ac-
countability Office, an arm of the U.S. 
Congress, in its infinite wisdom, has 
decided, contrary to the position of the 
executive branch Office of Management 
and Budget, OMB, that while the Presi-
dent may temporarily withhold funds 
from obligation—but not beyond the 
end of the fiscal year—he may not do 
so with vague or general assertions of 
policy priorities contrary to the will of 
Congress. 
The President’s response to this 
interbranch dispute between Congress 
and the executive branch was to assert 
his authority over foreign policy to de-
termine the timing of the best use of 
funds. Ultimately, this is a dispute 
that has constitutional implications 
under separation of power principles, 
about which this body is well familiar. 
It pits the President’s constitutional 
prerogatives to control foreign policy 
against Congress’s reasonable expecta-
tion that the President will comply 
with the Constitution’s faithful execu-
tion of the law requirement of his oath 
of office. 
This issue has come up before with 
other Presidents. There is a huge con-
stitutional debate among legal scholars 
about who is right. Law review articles 
have been written about it, one as re-
cently as last June in the Harvard Law 
Review. 
Congress, through its arm, the GAO, 
had an opposing view from that of the 
administration and OMB—big surprise. 
I am reminded of one of President 
Kennedy’s famous press conferences, 
where he was asked to comment about 
a report that the Republican National 
Committee had voted a resolution that 
concluded he was a total failure as 
President. He famously quipped: ‘‘I am 
sure that it was passed unanimously.’’ 
That is all that this is here: politics. 
No more, no less. And in the end, what 
are we talking about? The temporary 
hold was lifted and the funds were re-
leased, as they had to be under the law 
and as acknowledged was required by 
none other than Acting Chief of Staff 
Mick Mulvaney, 19 days before the end 
of the fiscal year on September 11, 2019. 
In any event, an alleged violation of 
the Impoundment Act can no more sus-
tain an Impeachment Article than can 
an assertion of executive privilege in 
opposition to a congressional subpoena, 
absent a final decision of a court order-
ing compliance with that subpoena. 
Mere assertion of a privilege or ob-
jection in a legitimate interbranch dis-
pute is a constitutional prerogative. It 
should never result in an impeachable 
offense for abuse of power or obstruc-
tion of Congress. And, yet, in a last- 
ditch effort to reframe its first Article 
of Impeachment on abuse of power, 
House managers, as part of the House 
Judiciary Committee report, have gone 
back into history—always a treach-
erous endeavor for lawyers. They now 
argue that President Andrew Johnson’s 
impeachment, from over 150 years ago 
following the end of the Civil War and 
during reconstruction, was not about a 
violation of the Tenure of Office Act, 
which, after all, was the violation of 
law charged as the principle Article of 
Impeachment but, instead, rested on 
his use of power with illegitimate mo-
tives. 
In an ahistorical sleight of hand wor-
thy only of the New York Times recent 
‘‘1619’’ series—a series, by the way, 
roundly criticized by two of my Prince-
ton Civil War and reconstruction his-
tory professors as inaccurate—House 
managers now claim that President 
Johnson’s removal of Lincoln’s Sec-
retary of War Edwin Stanton without 
Congress’s permission in violation of a 
congressional statute, later found to be 
unconstitutional, is best understood 
with the benefit of revisionist hind-
sight to be motivated not by his desire 
to violate the statute but on his illegit-
imate use of power to undermine recon-
struction 
and 
subordinate 
African 
Americans following the Civil War. 
That all may be true, but it is an-
other thing altogether to claim that 
that motive actually was the basis of 
Johnson’s 
impeachment. 
Professor 
Laurence Tribe, who was the source for 
this misguided reinterpretation of the 
Johnson impeachment, simply sub-
stitutes his own self-described, far

more compelling basis for Johnson’s re-
moval from office from the one that 
the House of Representatives actually 
voted on and the Senate considered at 
his impeachment trial. 
There has been an awful lot of that 
going on in this impeachment—people 
substituting their own interpretations 
for the ones that the principles actu-
ally and explicitly insist on. 
At any rate, a President’s so-called 
illegitimate motives in wielding power 
can no more frame and legitimize the 
Johnson impeachment than recasting 
the Nixon impeachment as really about 
his motives in defying Congress over 
the country’s foreign policy in Viet-
nam. Again, all of that may be true, 
but it has nothing to do with impeach-
ment. Not only that, it is also bad his-
tory. 
As recognized 65 years ago by then- 
Senator John F. Kennedy in his book 
‘‘Profiles in Courage,’’ President John-
son was saved from removal from office 
by one vote and thus by one courageous 
Senator who recognized the legislative 
overreach that the Tenure of Office Act 
represented. 
Quoting now from Senator Edmund 
G. Ross in ‘‘Profiles in Courage,’’ who 
explained his vote as follows: 
The independence of the executive office as 
a coordinate branch of the government was 
on trial. . . . If . . . the President must step 
down . . . upon insufficient proofs and from 
partisan considerations, the office of Presi-
dent would be degraded. 
So, too, here. Contrary, apparently 
to the fashion now, Senator Ross’s ac-
tion eventually was praised and accept-
ed several decades after his service and 
again many years later by President 
Kennedy as a courageous stand against 
legislative 
mob 
rule. 
Professor 
Dershowitz will have more to say about 
one other courageous Senator from 
that impeachment. More on that later. 
For now, the point is that our history 
demonstrates that Presidents should 
not be subject to impeachment based 
upon bad or ill motives, and any 
thought to the contrary should strike 
you, I submit, as exceedingly dan-
gerous to our constitutional structure 
of government. 
If that were the standard, what Presi-
dent would ever be safe by way of im-
peachment from what Hamilton de-
cried as the ‘‘persecution of an intem-
perate or designing majority in the 
House of Representatives’’? 
The central import of the abuse of 
power Article of Impeachment—indeed, 
when added together with the obstruc-
tion of justice article—is a result not 
far off from what one citizen tweet I 
saw back in December described as ar-
ticle I, Democrats don’t like President 
Trump; article II, Democrats can’t beat 
President Trump. 
President Trump is not removable 
from office just because a designing 
majority in the House, as represented 
by their managers, believes that the 
President abused the power of his office 
during the July 25 call with President 
Zelensky. The Constitution requires 
more. To ignore the requirement of 
proving that a crime was committed is 
to sidestep the constitutional design as 
well as the lessons of history. 
I know that many of you may come 
to conclude, or may have already con-
cluded, that the call was less than per-
fect. I have said on any number of oc-
casions previously—and publicly—that 
it would have been better, in attempt-
ing to spur action by a foreign govern-
ment in coordinating law enforcement 
efforts with our government, to have 
done so through proper channels. While 
the President certainly enjoys the 
power to do otherwise, there is con-
sequence to that action, as we have 
now witnessed. After all, that is why 
we are all here. 
But it is another thing altogether to 
claim that such conduct is clearly and 
unmistakably impeachable as an abuse 
of power. There can be no serious ques-
tion that this President, or any Presi-
dent, acts lawfully in requesting for-
eign assistance with investigations 
into possible corruption, even when it 
might potentially involve another poli-
tician. 
To argue otherwise would be to en-
gage in the specious contention that a 
Presidential candidate or, for that 
matter, any candidate enjoys absolute 
immunity from investigations during 
the course of a campaign. 
I can tell you that is not the case 
from my own experience. I did so dur-
ing 2000 in investigating Hillary Clin-
ton while she was running for office to 
become a U.S. Senator from New York, 
to which she was elected. 
My point simply is this: This Presi-
dent has been impeached and stands on 
trial here in the Senate for allegedly 
doing 
something 
indirectly 
about 
which he was entirely permitted to do 
directly. That cannot form a basis as 
an abuse of power article sufficient to 
warrant his removal from office. 
Turning now to the second Article of 
Impeachment, as we argued in our 
written trial brief, at the outset, it 
must be noted that it is at least a little 
odd for House managers to be arguing 
that President Trump somehow ob-
structed Congress when he declassified 
and released what is the central piece 
of evidence in this case. And that is, of 
course, the transcript of the July 25 
call, as well as the call with President 
Zelensky that preceded it on April 21, 
2019. 
Release of that full call record should 
have been the end of this claim of ob-
struction, but apparently not. Instead, 
again, relying on the United States v. 
Nixon, House managers have proffered 
a broad claim to documents and wit-
nesses in an impeachment inquiry, not-
withstanding the Nixon court’s limited 
holding that an objection by the Presi-
dent based on executive privilege could 
only be overcome in the limited cir-
cumstances presented there where the 
information sought was also material 
to the preparation of the defense by his 
coconspirators in pending cases await-
ing trial following indictments. In 
other 
words, 
a 
defendant’s 
Sixth 
Amendment right to a fair trial in col-
lateral proceedings was what the court 
actually found dispositive in rejecting 
the President’s claim of privilege to 
prevent Congress from gaining access 
to the Watergate tapes. 
All subsequent administrations have 
defended that narrow exception against 
any general claim of access to execu-
tive branch confidential communica-
tions, documents, and witnesses who 
are the President’s closest advisers. 
Thus, it should be a matter of accept-
ed wisdom and historical premise that 
a President cannot be removed from of-
fice for invoking established legal 
rights, defenses, privileges, and immu-
nities, even in the face of subpoenas 
from House committees. Back in 1998, 
Professor Tribe called out any argu-
ment to the contrary as frivolous and 
dangerous. 
House managers respond now by ar-
guing, nonetheless, that the President 
has no right to defy a legitimate sub-
poena, particularly, I suppose, when 
their impeachment efforts are at stake. 
And thus, it is an issue rising to the 
level of an interbranch conflict that in 
our system of government only accom-
modation between the branches and, 
ultimately, courts can finally resolve. 
The House chose to forgo that course 
and to plow forward with impeach-
ment. House managers cannot be heard 
to complain now that their own stra-
tegic choice can form any basis to 
place blame on the President for it and, 
worse yet, to then impeach him on that 
basis and seek his removal from office. 
That is no basis at all, as Professor 
Jonathan Turley persuasively has ex-
plained. 
Compliance with a legitimate sub-
poena is enforced over a claim of exec-
utive privilege or Presidential immu-
nity only when a court with jurisdic-
tion says so in a final decision. 
In sum, calling a subpoena legiti-
mate, as House managers have done 
here, does not make it so. An analogy 
taken from baseball, which I believe 
the Chief Justice might appreciate, 
makes the point: A longtime major 
league umpire named Bill Klem, who 
worked until 1941 after 37 years in the 
big leagues, was once asked during a 
game by a player whether a ball was 
fair or foul. The umpire replied: It ain’t 
nothing until I call it. 
I say the same thing to Chairman 
SCHIFF now. It’s not a legitimate and, 
therefore, enforceable subpoena until a 
court says that it is. 
Preceding the Clinton impeachment 
and, indeed, in response to demands 
not just from the Whitewater inde-
pendent counsel but also from several 
other of the independent counsel inves-
tigations that were ongoing at that 
time—and, again, I know, I was in one 
of them—the White House repeatedly 
asserted claims of executive privilege. 
Many of those claims were litigated for 
months, not weeks, and in some cases 
for years. 
When I hear Mr. SCHIFF’s complaint 
that the House’s request for former

January 27, 2020 
White House Counsel Don McGahn’s 
testimony, grand jury material, and 
other documents has been drawn out 
since April of last year, I can only say 
in response: Boohoo. 
Did I think at the time that many of 
those claims of privilege were frivolous 
and an abuse of the judicial process? Of 
course. And, indeed, that was the de-
termination of the House Judiciary 
Committee during the Clinton im-
peachment. What did they do about it? 
Nothing. The committee properly con-
cluded then that those assertions of 
privilege, even if ill-founded, did not 
constitute an impeachable offense. Did 
I believe that the Clinton administra-
tion’s actions in this regard have ad-
versely impacted our investigation? 
You bet I did. And I said so in the final 
report. But never did I seriously con-
sider that those efforts by the White 
House, although endlessly frustrating 
and damaging to the independent coun-
sel’s investigation, would constitute 
the crime of obstruction of justice or 
any related impeachable offense for ob-
struction of Congress. Instead, I and 
my colleagues did the best that we 
could in reaching an accommodation 
with the White House where possible or 
through litigation, when necessary, in 
order to complete the task at hand, to 
the best of our ability to do so. 
Any contention that what has tran-
spired here involving this administra-
tion’s assertion of valid and well-recog-
nized claims of privileges and immuni-
ties is somehow contrary to law and 
impeachable is ludicrous. In short, to 
add to the parade of criminal offenses 
not sustained on this impeachment, 
there was no obstruction of justice or 
of Congress, period. 
The President cannot be impeached 
and removed from office for asserting, 
subject to judicial review, what he has 
every right to assert. That is true now, 
as it has been true of every President 
all the way back to President George 
Washington. 
In short, as to both Articles of Im-
peachment, all the President is asking 
for here is basic fairness and to be held 
to the very same standard that both 
House Speaker NANCY PELOSI proffered 
in March 2019 and which previously was 
endorsed during the Clinton impeach-
ment in strikingly similar language by 
House manager JERRY NADLER 20-odd 
years ago in 1998. The evidence must be 
nothing less than ‘‘compelling, over-
whelming, and bipartisan.’’ We agree. 
No amount of witness testimony, docu-
ments, high-fives, fist-bumps, signing 
pens, or otherwise are ever going to be 
sufficient to sustain this impeachment 
under the Democrats’ own standard. 
With that, I am ready to conclude. 
The President’s only instruction to me 
for this trial was a simple one: Do what 
you think is right. 
As a country, we need to put a stop 
to doing anything and everything that 
we can do and start doing what is right 
and what needs to be done in the Na-
tion’s best interests. A brazenly par-
tisan, political impeachment by House 
Democrats is not, I submit, in the best 
interest of this country because in the 
final analysis, we will all be judged in 
the eyes of history on whether, in this 
moment, we act with the country’s 
overriding welfare firmly in mind rath-
er than in advancing the cause of par-
tisan political advantage. 
I have always believed as an article 
of faith that in good times and in hard 
times and even in bad times, with mat-
ters of importance at stake, that this 
country gets the big things right. I 
have seen that in my own life and for 
my own experience, even in Wash-
ington, DC. 
Well, Members of the Senate, this, 
what lies before you now, is just such a 
big thing. The next election awaits. 
Election day is only 9 months away. 
As Senator Dale Bumpers eloquently 
concluded in arguing against President 
Clinton’s removal from office: 
That is the day when we reach across this 
aisle and hold hands, Democrats and Repub-
licans, and we say, win or lose, we will abide 
by the decision. It is a solemn event, a Presi-
dential election, and it should not be undone 
lightly or just because one side has political 
clout and the other one doesn’t. 
Otherwise, 
as 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
warned us during his first inaugural 
address: 
If the minority will not acquiesce . . . the 
government must cease. 
So that rejecting the majority principle, 
anarchy . . . in some form, is all that is left. 
This impeachment and the refusal to 
accept the results of the last election 
in 2016 cannot be left to stand. For the 
reasons stated, the Articles of Im-
peachment, therefore, should be re-
jected, and the President must be ac-
quitted. 
Members of the Senate, thank you 
very much. 
With that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield 
back to Mr. Sekulow. 
Thank you. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, we are going to now delve into 
the constitutional issues for a bit and 
our 
presenter 
is 
Professor 
Alan 
Dershowitz. He is the Felix Frank-
furter Professor Emeritus of Harvard 
Law School. After serving as a law 
clerk for Judge David Bazelon of the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District 
of Columbia, he served as a law clerk 
for Justice Arthur Goldberg at the U.S. 
Supreme Court. At the age of 28, Pro-
fessor Dershowitz became the youngest 
tenured professor at Harvard Law 
School. Mr. Dershowitz spent 50 years 
as an active faculty member at Har-
vard, teaching generations of law stu-
dents, including several Members of 
this Chamber, in classes ranging from 
criminal law to constitutional law, 
criminal procedure, constitutional liti-
gation, legal ethics, and even courses 
on impeachment. He will address the 
constitutional issues raised by these 
articles. 
Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief 
Justice, distinguished Members of the 
Senate, our friends, lawyers, fellow 
lawyers, it is a great honor for me to 
stand before you today to present a 
constitutional argument against the 
impeachment and removal not only of 
this President but of all and any future 
Presidents who may be charged with 
the unconstitutional grounds of abuse 
of power and obstruction of Congress. 
I stand before you today as I stood in 
1973 and 1974 for the protection of the 
constitutional and procedural rights of 
Richard Nixon, whom I personally ab-
horred, and whose impeachment I per-
sonally favored; and as I stood for the 
rights of President Clinton, whom I ad-
mired 
and 
whose 
impeachment 
I 
strongly opposed. I stand against the 
application and misapplication of the 
constitutional criteria in every case 
and against any President without re-
gard to whether I support his or her 
parties or policies. I would be making 
the very same constitutional argument 
had Hillary Clinton, for whom I voted, 
been elected and had a Republican 
House voted to impeach her on these 
unconstitutional grounds. 
I am here today because I love my 
country and our Constitution. Every-
one in this room shares that love. I will 
argue that our Constitution and its 
terms, high crimes and misdemeanors, 
do not encompass the two articles 
charging abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress. In offering these ar-
guments, I stand in the footsteps and 
in the spirit of Justice Benjamin Cur-
tis, who was of counsel to impeached 
President Andrew Johnson and who ex-
plained to the Senate that ‘‘a greater 
principle was at stake than the fate of 
any particular president’’ and of Wil-
liam Evarts, a former Secretary of 
State, another one of Andrew John-
son’s lawyers, who reportedly said that 
he had come to the defense table not as 
a ‘‘partisan,’’ not as a ‘‘sympathizer,’’ 
but to ‘‘defend the Constitution.’’ 
The Constitution, of course, provides 
that the Senate has the sole role and 
power to try all impeachments. In ex-
ercising that power, the Senate must 
consider three issues in this case. 
The first is whether the evidence pre-
sented by the House managers estab-
lishes, by the appropriate standard of 
proof—proof 
beyond 
a 
reasonable 
doubt—that the factual allegations oc-
curred. 
The second is whether, if these fac-
tual allegations occurred, did they rise 
to the level of abuse of power and/or 
obstruction of Congress? 
Finally, the Senate must determine 
whether abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress are constitutionally 
authorized criteria for impeachment. 
The first issue is largely factual and 
I leave that to others. The second is a 
combination of traditional and con-
stitutional law, and I will touch on 
those. The third is a matter of pure 
constitutional law. Do charges of abuse 
and obstruction rise to the level of im-
peachable offenses under the Constitu-
tion? 
I will begin, as all constitutional 
analysis begins, with the text of the 
Constitution governing impeachment. I

will then examine why the Framers se-
lected the words they did as the sole 
criteria authorizing impeachment. In 
making my presentation, I will trans-
port you back to a hot summer in 
Philadelphia and a cold winter in 
Washington. I will introduce you to pa-
triots and ideas that helped shape our 
great Nation. 
To prepare for this journey, I have 
immersed myself in a lot of dusty old 
volumes from the 18th and 19th cen-
tury. I ask your indulgence as I quote 
from the wisdom of our Founders. This 
return to the days of yesteryear is nec-
essary because the issue today is not 
what the criteria of impeachment 
should be, not what a legislative body 
or a constitutional body might today 
decide are the proper criteria for im-
peachment of a President but what the 
Framers of our Constitution actually 
chose and what they expressly and im-
plicitly rejected. 
I will ask whether the Framers would 
have accepted such vague and open- 
ended terms as ‘‘abuse of power’’ and 
‘‘obstruction of Congress’’ as governing 
criteria. I will show by close review of 
the history that they did not and would 
not accept such criteria for fear that 
these criteria would turn our new Re-
public into a British-style parliamen-
tary democracy in which the Chief Ex-
ecutive’s tenure would be, in the words 
of James Madison, father of our Con-
stitution, ‘‘at the pleasure’’ of the leg-
islature. 
The conclusion I will offer for your 
consideration is similar, though not 
identical, to that advocated by highly 
respected Justice Benjamin Curtis, who 
as you know, dissented from the Su-
preme Court’s notorious decision in 
Dred Scott, and who, after resigning in 
protest from the High Court, served as 
counsel to President Andrew Johnson 
in the Senate impeachment trial. He 
argued that ‘‘there can be no crime, 
there can be no misdemeanor without a 
law, written or unwritten, express or 
implied.’’ 
In so arguing, he was echoing the 
conclusion reached by Dean Theodore 
Dwight of the Columbia Law School, 
who wrote in 1867, just before the im-
peachment, that ‘‘unless the crime is 
specifically named in the Constitu-
tion’’—treason and bribery—‘‘impeach-
ments, like indictments, can only be 
instituted 
for 
crimes 
committed 
against the statutory law of the United 
States.’’ As Judge Starr said earlier 
today, he described that as the weight 
of authority being on the side of that 
proposition at a time much closer to 
the framing than we are today. 
The main thrust of my argument, 
however, and the one most relevant to 
these proceedings is that even if that 
position is not accepted, even if crimi-
nal conduct were not required, the 
Framers of our Constitution implicitly 
rejected—and, if it had been presented 
to them, would have explicitly re-
jected—such vague terms as ‘‘abuse of 
power’’ and ‘‘obstruction of Congress’’ 
as among the enumerated and defined 
criteria for impeaching a President. 
You will recall in the many Articles 
of 
Impeachment 
against 
President 
Johnson 
were 
accusations 
of 
non-
criminal but outrageous misbehavior, 
including ones akin to abuse of power 
and obstruction of Congress. For exam-
ple, article X charged Johnson ‘‘did at-
tempt to bring into disgrace, ridicule, 
hatred, contempt and reproach, the 
Congress of the United States.’’ 
Article XI charged Johnson with de-
nying that Congress was [a]uthorized 
by the Constitution to exercise the leg-
islative power’’ and denying that ‘‘[t]he 
legislation of said Congress was obliga-
tory upon him.’’ Those are pretty seri-
ous charges. 
Here is how Justice Curtis responded 
to these noncriminal charges: 
My first position is, that when the Con-
stitution speaks of treason, bribery, and 
other crimes and misdemeanors, it refers to, 
and includes only, high criminal offenses 
against the United States, made so by some 
law of the United States existing when the 
acts complained of were done, and I say that 
this is plainly to be inferred from each and 
every provision of the Constitution on the 
subject of impeachment. 
I will briefly review those other pro-
visions of the Constitution with you. 
Judge Curtis’s interpretation is sup-
ported—indeed, in his view it was com-
pelled—by 
the 
constitutional 
text. 
Treason, 
bribery, 
and 
other 
high 
crimes and misdemeanors are high 
crimes. Other high crimes and mis-
demeanors must be akin to treason and 
bribery. Curtis cited the Latin phrase 
‘‘Noscitur a sociis,’’—I am sorry for my 
pronunciation—referring to a classic 
rule of interpretation that when the 
meaning of a word that is part of a 
group of words is uncertain, you should 
look to the other words in that group 
that provide interpretive context. 
The late Justice Antonin Scalia gave 
the following current example. If one 
speaks 
of 
Mickey 
Mantle, 
Rocky 
Marciano, Michael Jordan, and other 
great competitors, the last noun does 
not reasonably refer to Sam Walton, 
who is a great competitor, but in busi-
ness, or Napoleon, a great competitor 
on the battlefield. Applying that rule 
to the groups of words ‘‘treason, brib-
ery, or other high crimes and mis-
demeanors,’’ the last five words should 
be interpreted to include only serious 
criminal behavior akin to treason and 
bribery. 
Justice Curtis then reviewed the 
other provisions of the Constitution 
that relate to impeachment. First, he 
started with the provision that says 
‘‘the President of the United States 
shall have Power to grant Reprieves 
and Pardons’’—listen now—‘‘for Of-
fenses against the United States, ex-
cept in Cases of Impeachment.’’ 
He cogently argued that if impeach-
ment were not for ‘‘offenses against the 
United States’’—was not based on an 
offense against the United States— 
there would have been no need for any 
constitutional exception. 
He then went on to a second provi-
sion: ‘‘The trial of all crimes, except in 
cases of impeachment, shall be by 
jury.’’ This demonstrated, according to 
Curtis, that impeachment requires a 
crime, but unlike other crimes, it does 
not require a jury trial. You are the 
judge and the jury. He also pointed out 
that an impeachment trial, by the ‘‘ex-
press words’’ of the Constitution, re-
quires an ‘‘acquittal’’ or a ‘‘convic-
tion,’’ judgments generally rendered 
only in the trials of crimes. 
Now, President Johnson’s lawyers, of 
course, argued in the alternative, as all 
lawyers do when there are questions of 
fact and law. He argued that Johnson 
did not violate the Articles of Impeach-
ment, as you heard from other lawyers 
today but, even if he did, that the arti-
cles do not charge impeachable of-
fenses, which is the argument that I 
am making before you this evening. 
Justice Curtis’s first position, how-
ever, was that the articles did not 
charge an impeachable offense because 
they did not allege ‘‘high criminal of-
fenses against the United States.’’ 
According to Harvard historian and 
law professor Nikolas Bowie, Curtis’s 
constitutional arguments were persua-
sive to at least some Senators who 
were no friends of President Johnson’s, 
including the coauthors of the 13th and 
the 14th Amendments. As Senator Wil-
liam Pitt Fessenden later put it, 
‘‘Judge Curtis gave us the law, and we 
followed it.’’ 
Senator James W. Grimes echoed 
Curtis’s argument by refusing to ‘‘ac-
cept an interpretation’’ of high crimes 
and misdemeanors that changes ‘‘ac-
cording to the law of each Senator’s 
judgment, enacted in his own bosom 
after the alleged commission of the of-
fense.’’ Though he desperately wanted 
to see President Johnson, whom he de-
spised, out of office, he believed that an 
impeachment removal without the vio-
lation of law would be ‘‘construed into 
approval of impeachments as part of 
future political machinery.’’ 
According to Professor Bowie, Jus-
tice Curtis’s constitutional arguments 
may well have contributed to the deci-
sion by at least some of the seven Re-
publican dissidents to defy their party 
and vote for acquittal, which was se-
cured by a single vote. 
Today, Professor Bowie has an arti-
cle in the New York Times in which he 
repeats his view of ‘‘impeachment re-
quires a crime,’’ but he now argues 
that the Articles of Impeachment do 
charge crimes. He is simply wrong. He 
is wrong because, in the United States 
v. Hudson—a case decided almost more 
than 200 years ago now—the U.S. Su-
preme Court ruled that Federal courts 
have no jurisdiction to create common 
law crimes. Crimes are only what are 
in the statute book. 
So Professor Bowie is right that the 
Constitution requires a crime for im-
peachment but wrong when he says 
that common law crimes can be used as 
a basis for impeaching even though 
they don’t appear in the statute books. 
Now, I am not here arguing that the 
current distinguished Members of the 
Senate are in any way bound—legally

bound—by Justice Curtis’s arguments 
or those of Dean Dwight, but I am ar-
guing that you should give them seri-
ous consideration—the consideration 
to which they are entitled by the emi-
nence of their author and the role they 
may have played in the outcome of the 
closest precedent to the current case. 
I want to be clear. There is a nuanced 
difference 
between 
the 
arguments 
made by Curtis and Dwight and the ar-
gument that I am presenting here 
today based on my reading of history. 
Curtis argued that there must be a 
specific violation of preexisting law. He 
recognized that, at the time of the Con-
stitution, there were no Federal crimi-
nal statutes. Of course not. The Con-
stitution established a national gov-
ernment, so we couldn’t have statutes 
prior to the establishment of our Con-
stitution and our Nation. 
This argument is offered today by 
proponents of this impeachment on the 
claim that the Framers could not have 
intended to limit the criteria for im-
peachment to criminal-like behavior. 
Justice Curtis addressed that issue and 
that argument head-on. 
He pointed out that crimes such as 
bribery would be made criminal ‘‘by 
the laws of the United States, which 
the Framers of the Constitution knew 
would be passed.’’ In other words, he 
anticipated that Congress would soon 
enact statutes punishing and defining 
crimes such as burglary, extortion, per-
jury, et cetera. He anticipated that, 
and he based his argument, in part, on 
that. 
The Constitution already included 
treason as a crime, and that was de-
fined in the Constitution itself, and 
then it included other crimes; but what 
Justice Curtis said is that you could 
include laws, ‘‘written or unwritten, 
express 
or 
implied’’—by 
which 
he 
meant common law, which, at the time 
of the Constitution, there were many 
common law crimes—and they were en-
forceable, even federally, until the Su-
preme Court, many years later, decided 
that common law crimes were no 
longer part of Federal jurisdiction. 
So the position that I have derived 
from history would include—and this is 
a word that will upset some people— 
criminal-like conduct akin to treason 
and bribery. There need not be, in my 
view, conclusive evidence of a tech-
nical crime that would necessarily re-
sult in a criminal conviction. Let me 
explain. 
For example, if a President were to 
receive or give a bribe outside of the 
United States and outside of the stat-
ute of limitations, he could not tech-
nically be prosecuted in the United 
States for such a crime, but I believe 
he could be impeached for such a crime 
because he committed the crime of 
bribery even though he couldn’t tech-
nically be accused of it in the United 
States. That is the distinction that I 
think we draw. Or if a President com-
mitted extortion, perjury, or obstruc-
tion of justice, he could be charged 
with these crimes as impeachable of-
fenses because these crimes, though 
not specified in the Constitution, are 
akin to treason and bribery. This 
would be true even if some of the tech-
nical elements—time and place—were 
absent. 
What Curtis and Dwight and I agree 
upon—and this is the key point in this 
impeachment case; please understand 
what I am arguing—is that purely non-
criminal conduct, including abuse of 
power and obstruction of Congress, are 
outside the range of impeachable of-
fenses. That is the key argument I am 
presenting today. 
This view was supported by text writ-
ers and judges close in time to the 
founding. 
William 
Oldhall 
Russell, 
whose 1819 treatise on criminal law was 
a Bible among criminal law scholars 
and others, defined ‘‘high crimes and 
misdemeanors’’ as ‘‘such immoral and 
unlawful acts as are nearly allied, and 
equal in guilt, to a felony; and yet, 
owing to the absence of some technical 
circumstances’’—technical 
cir-
cumstances—‘‘do not fall within the 
definition of a felony.’’ Similar views 
were expressed by some State courts. 
Others disagreed. 
Curtis’s considered views and those 
of Dwight, Russell, and others, based 
on careful study of the text and his-
tory, are not ‘‘bonkers,’’ ‘‘absurdist,’’ 
‘‘legal claptrap,’’ or other demeaning 
epithets thrown around by partisan 
supporters of this impeachment. As 
Judge Starr pointed out, they have the 
weight of authority. They were accept-
ed by the generation of the Founders 
and the generations that followed. If 
they are not accepted by academics 
today, that shows a weakness among 
the academics, not among the Found-
ers. Those who disagree with Curtis’s 
textual analysis are obliged, I believe, 
to respond with reason, counter inter-
pretations, not name-calling. 
If Justice Curtis’s arguments and 
those of Dean Dwight are rejected, I 
think then proponents of impeachment 
must offer alternative principles and 
alternative standards for impeachment 
and removal. 
We just heard that, in 1970, Congress-
man Gerald Ford, whom I greatly ad-
mired, said the following in the context 
of an impeachment of justice: ‘‘[A]n 
impeachable offense is whatever a ma-
jority of the House of Representatives 
considers it to be at a given moment in 
history,’’ et cetera. You all know the 
quote. 
Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS re-
cently put it more succinctly in the 
context of a Presidential impeachment. 
Here is what she said: 
Impeachment is whatever Congress says it 
is. There is no law. 
But this lawless view would place 
Congress above the law. It would place 
Congress above the Constitution. For 
Congress to ignore the specific words of 
the Constitution itself and substitute 
its own judgments would be for Con-
gress to do what it is accusing the 
President of doing—and no one is above 
the law, not the President and not Con-
gress. 
This is precisely the kind of view ex-
pressly rejected by the Framers, who 
feared having a President serve at the 
‘‘pleasure’’ of the legislature, and it is 
precisely the view rejected by Senator 
James Grimes when he refused to ac-
cept an interpretation of high crimes 
and misdemeanors that would change 
‘‘according to the law of each Senator’s 
judgment, enacted in his own bosom.’’ 
The Constitution requires, in the 
words of Gouverneur Morris, that the 
criteria for impeachment must be 
‘‘enumerated and defined.’’ Those who 
advocate 
impeachment 
today 
are 
obliged to demonstrate how the cri-
teria accepted by the House in this 
case are enumerated and defined in the 
Constitution. 
The compelling textual analysis pro-
vided by Justice Curtis is confirmed by 
the debate in the Constitutional Con-
vention, by the Federalist Papers, by 
the writings of William Blackstone, 
and, I believe, by the writings of Alex-
ander Hamilton, which were heavily re-
lied on by lawyers at the time of the 
Constitution’s adoption. 
There were at the time of the Con-
stitution’s adoption two great debates 
that went on, and it is very important 
to understand the distinction between 
these two great debates. It is hard to 
imagine today, but the first was, 
Should there be any power to impeach 
a President at all? There were several 
members of the founding generation 
and of the Framers of the Constitution 
who said no—who said, no, a President 
shouldn’t be allowed to be impeached. 
The second—and the second is very, 
very important in our consideration 
today—is, If a President is to be sub-
ject to impeachment, what should the 
criteria be? These are very different 
issues, and they are often erroneously 
conflated. 
Let’s begin with the first debate. 
During 
the 
broad 
debate 
about 
whether a President should be subject 
to impeachment, proponents of im-
peachment used vague and open-ended 
terms, such as ‘‘unfit,’’ ‘‘obnoxious,’’ 
‘‘corrupt,’’ 
‘‘misconduct,’’ 
‘‘mis-
behavior,’’ 
‘‘negligence,’’ 
‘‘mal-
practice,’’ ‘‘perfidy,’’ ‘‘treachery,’’ ‘‘in-
capacity,’’ ‘‘peculation,’’ and ‘‘mal-
administration.’’ They worried that a 
President might ‘‘pervert his adminis-
tration into a scheme of speculation 
and oppression’’; that he might be 
‘‘corrupted by foreign influence’’; and— 
yes, this is important—that he might 
have ‘‘great opportunities of abusing 
his power.’’ 
Those were the concerns that led the 
Framers to decide that a President 
must be subject to impeachment, but 
not a single one of the Framers sug-
gested that these general fears justi-
fying the need for an impeachment and 
removal mechanism should automati-
cally be accepted as a specific criterion 
for impeachment. Far from it. 
As Gouverneur Morris aptly put it: 
‘‘[C]orruption and some other offenses 
. . . ought to be impeachable, but . . . 
the cases ought to be enumerated and 
defined.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S612 
January 27, 2020 
The great fallacy of many contem-
porary scholars and pundits and, with 
due respect, Members of the House of 
Representatives is that they fail to un-
derstand the critical distinction be-
tween the broad reasons for needing an 
impeachment mechanism and the care-
fully enumerated and defined criteria 
that should authorize the deployment 
of this powerful weapon. 
Let me give you a hypothetical ex-
ample that might have faced Congress 
or, certainly, will face Congress. 
Let’s assume that there is a debate 
over regulating the content of social 
media—whether we should have regula-
tions or criminal, civil regulations 
over Twitter or Facebook, et cetera. In 
the debate over regulating the social 
media, proponents of regulation might 
well cite broad dangers, such as false 
information, 
inappropriate 
content, 
hate speech. Those are good reasons for 
having regulation; but when it came to 
enumerating and defining what should 
be 
prohibited, 
such 
broad 
dangers 
would have to be balanced against 
other important policies, and the re-
sulting legislation would be much nar-
rower and more carefully defined than 
the broad dangers that necessitated 
some regulation. 
The Framers understood and acted 
on this difference, but I am afraid that 
many scholars and others and Members 
of Congress fail to see this distinction, 
and they cite some of the fears that led 
to the need for an impeachment mech-
anism. They cite them as the criteria 
themselves. That is a deep fallacy, and 
it is crucially important that the dis-
tinction be sharply drawn between ar-
guments made in favor of impeaching 
and the criteria then decided upon to 
justify the impeachment specifically of 
the President. 
The Framers understood this, and so 
they got down to the difficult business 
of enumerating and defining precisely 
which offenses, among the many that 
they feared a President might commit, 
should be impeachable as distinguished 
by those left to the voters to evaluate. 
Some Framers, such as Roger Sher-
man, wanted the President to be re-
movable by ‘‘the National legislature’’ 
at its ‘‘pleasure,’’ much like the Prime 
Minister can be removed by a simple 
vote of no confidence by Parliament. 
That view was rejected. 
Benjamin Franklin opposed decidedly 
the making of the Executive ‘‘the mere 
creature of the legislature.’’ 
Gouverneur Morris was against ‘‘a 
dependence of the Executive on the 
Legislature, considering the Legisla-
ture’’—you will pardon me for quoting 
this—‘‘a great danger to be appre-
hended . . . ‘’ 
I don’t agree with that. 
James Madison expressed concern 
about the President being improperly 
dependent on the legislature. Others 
worried about a feeble executive. 
Hearing these and other arguments 
against turning the new Republic into 
a parliamentary democracy, in which 
the legislature had the power to re-
move the President, the Framers set 
out to strike the appropriate balance 
between the broad concerns that led 
them to vote for a provision author-
izing the impeachment of the President 
and the need for specific criteria not 
subject to legislative abuse or overuse. 
Among the criteria proposed were: 
malpractice, 
neglect 
of 
duty, 
malconduct, neglect in the execution 
of office, and—and this word we will 
come back to talk about—maladmin-
istration. 
It was in response to that last term, 
a term used in Britain, as a criteria for 
impeachment that Madison responded: 
‘‘So vague a term will be equivalent to 
a tenure during the pleasure of the 
Senate.’’ 
Upon hearing Madison’s objections 
Colonel Mason withdrew ‘‘maladmin-
istration’’ and substituted ‘‘other high 
crimes and misdemeanors.’’ 
Had a delegate proposed inclusion of 
‘‘abuse of power’’ or ‘‘obstruction of 
Congress’’ as enumerated and defined 
criteria 
for 
impeachment, 
history 
strongly suggests that Madison would 
have similarly opposed it, and it would 
have been rejected. 
I will come back to that argument a 
little later on when I talk specifically 
about abuse of power. 
Indeed, Madison worried that a par-
tisan legislature could even misuse the 
word ‘‘misdemeanor’’ to include a 
broad array of noncrimes, so he pro-
posed moving the trial to the non-
partisan Supreme Court. The proposal 
was rejected. 
Now, this does not mean, as some 
have suggested, that Madison suddenly 
changed his mind and favored such 
misuse to expand the meaning of ‘‘mis-
demeanor’’ to include broad terms like 
‘‘misbehavior.’’ No, it only meant that 
he feared—he feared that the word 
‘‘misdemeanor’’ could be abused. His 
fear has been proved prescient by the 
misuse of that term, ‘‘high crimes and 
misdemeanors,’’ by the House, in this 
case. 
Now, the best evidence that the 
broad concerns cited by the Framers to 
justify impeachment were not auto-
matically accepted as criteria justi-
fying impeachment is the manner by 
which the word ‘‘incapacity’’—focus on 
that 
word, 
please—incapacity 
was 
treated. 
Madison and others focused heavily 
on the problem of what happens if a 
President becomes incapacitated. Cer-
tainly, a President who is incapaci-
tated should not be allowed to continue 
to preside over this great country. And 
everyone seemed to agree that the pos-
sibility of Presidential incapacity is a 
good and powerful reason for having 
impeachment provisions. 
But when it came time to estab-
lishing criteria for actually removing a 
President, ‘‘incapacity’’ was not in-
cluded. Why not? Presumably because 
it was too vague and subjective a term. 
And when we had the incapacitated 
President in the end of the Woodrow 
Wilson second term, he was not im-
peached and removed. 
A constitutional amendment with 
carefully drawn procedural safeguards 
against abuse was required to remedy 
the daunting problem of a President 
who was deemed incapacitated. 
Now, another reason why incapacita-
tion was not included among impeach-
able offenses is because it is not crimi-
nal. It is not a crime to be incapaci-
tated. It is not akin to treason. It is 
not akin to bribery, and it is not a high 
crime and misdemeanor. 
The Framers believed that impeach-
able offenses must be criminal in na-
ture and akin to the most serious 
crimes. Incapacity simply did not fit 
into this category. Nothing criminal 
about it. 
So the Constitution had to be amend-
ed to include a different category of 
noncriminal behavior that warranted 
removal. 
I urge you to consider seriously that 
important part of the history of the 
adoption of our Constitution. 
I think that Blackstone and Ham-
ilton also support this view. 
There is no disagreement over the 
conclusion that the words ‘‘treason, 
bribery, or other high crimes’’—those 
words require criminal behavior. The 
debate is only over the words ‘‘and mis-
demeanors.’’ The Framers of the Con-
stitution were fully cognizant of the 
fact that the word ‘‘misdemeanor’’ was 
a species of crime. 
The 
book 
that 
was 
most 
often 
deemed authoritative was written by 
William Blackstone of Great Britain, 
and here is what he says about this in 
the version that was available to the 
Framers: 
A crime, or misdemeanor, is an act com-
mitted or omitted, in violation of the [pub-
lic] law, either forbidding or commanding it. 
The general definition comprehends both 
crimes and misdemeanors; which, properly 
speaking, are mere synonymous terms. 
Mere synonymous terms. He went 
then on: 
[T]hough, in common usage, the word 
‘‘crimes’’ is made to denote such offenses are 
of a deeper and more atrocious dye; while 
smaller faults, and omissions of less con-
sequence, are comprised under the gentler 
name of ‘‘misdemeanors’’ only. 
Interestingly, though, he pointed out 
that misdemeanors were not always so 
gentle. 
There was a category called ‘‘capital 
misdemeanors,’’ where if you stole 
somebody’s pig or other fowl, you could 
be sentenced to death, but it was only 
for a misdemeanor. Don’t worry. It is 
not for a felony. But there were mis-
demeanors that were capital in nature. 
Moreover, Blackstone wrote that par-
liamentary impeachment ‘‘is a pros-
ecution’’—a prosecution—‘‘of already 
known and established law [presented] 
to the most high and Supreme Court of 
criminal jurisdiction’’—analogous to 
this great court. 
He observed that ‘‘[a] commoner [can 
be impeached] but only for high mis-
demeanors: a peer may be impeached 
for any crime’’—any crime. 
This certainly suggests that Black-
stone deemed high misdemeanors to be 
a species of crime.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S613 
January 27, 2020 
Hamilton is a little less clear on this 
issue, and not surprisingly because he 
was writing—in Federalist No. 65, he 
was writing not to define what the cri-
teria for impeachment were, he was 
writing primarily in defense of the 
Constitution as written and less to de-
fine its provisions, but he certainly 
cannot be cited as in favor of criteria 
such as abuse of power or obstruction 
of Congress, nor of impeachment voted 
along party lines. 
He warned that the ‘‘greatest dan-
ger’’—these 
were 
his 
words—‘‘the 
greatest danger [is] that the decision 
will be regulated more by the compara-
tive strength of parties, than by the 
real demonstrations of innocence or 
guilt.’’ 
In addition to using the criminal 
terms ‘‘innocence’’ or ‘‘guilt,’’ Ham-
ilton also referred to ‘‘prosecution’’ 
and ‘‘sentence.’’ He cited the constitu-
tional provisions that states that ‘‘the 
party convicted shall nevertheless be 
libel and subject’’ to a criminal trial, 
as a reason for not having the Presi-
dent tried before the Supreme Court. 
He feared a double prosecution, a var-
iation of double jeopardy, before the 
same judiciary. These points all sound 
in criminal terms. 
But advocates of a broad, open-ended, 
noncriminal interpretation of ‘‘high 
crimes and misdemeanors’’ insist that 
Hamilton is on their side, and they cite 
the following words regarding the 
court of impeachment. And I think I 
heard these words quoted more than 
any other words in support of a broad 
view of impeachment, and they are 
misunderstood. Here is what he said 
when describing the court of impeach-
ment. He said: 
The subjects of its jurisdiction— 
Those are important words, the sub-
jects of its jurisdiction, by which he 
meant treason, bribery, and other high 
crimes and misdemeanors. 
The subjects of its jurisdiction are those 
offenses which proceed from the misconduct 
of public men, or, in other words, from the 
abuse or violation of some public trust. They 
are of a nature which may with peculiar pro-
priety be denominated POLITICAL, as they 
relate chiefly to injuries done immediately 
to society itself.’’ 
Those are Hamilton’s words. They 
are often misunderstood as suggesting 
that the criteria authorizing impeach-
ment include ‘‘the misconduct of pub-
lic men’’ or ‘‘the abuse or violation of 
some public trust.’’ 
That is a misreading. These words 
were used to characterize the constitu-
tional criteria that are ‘‘the subject 
of’’ the jurisdiction of the court of im-
peachment: namely, ‘‘treason, bribery, 
or 
other 
high 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors.’’ 
Those specified crimes are political 
in nature. They are the crimes that in-
volve ‘‘misconduct of public men’’ and 
‘‘the abuse or violation of some public 
trust.’’ 
Hamilton was not expanding the 
specified criteria to include—as inde-
pendent grounds for impeachment— 
misconduct, abuse, or violation. If any-
thing, he was contracting them to re-
quire, in addition to proof of the speci-
fied crimes, also proof that the crime 
must be of a political nature. 
This would exclude President Clin-
ton’s private, nonpolitical crimes. In 
fact, and this is interesting, Hamilton’s 
view was cited by Clinton’s advocates 
as contracting, not expanding, the 
meaning of ‘‘high crimes.’’ 
Today, some of these same advocates, 
you look at the same words and cite 
them as expanding its meaning. 
Clinton was accused of a crime—per-
jury—and so the issue in his case was 
not whether the Constitution required 
a crime for impeachment. Instead, the 
issue was whether Clinton’s alleged 
crime could be classified as a ‘‘high 
crime’’ in light of the personal nature. 
During the Clinton impeachment, I 
stated in an interview that I did not 
think that a technical crime was re-
quired but that I did think that abus-
ing trust could be considered. I said 
that. 
At that time, I had not done the ex-
tensive research on that issue because 
it was irrelevant to the Clinton case, 
and I was not fully aware of the com-
pelling counterarguments. So I simply 
accepted the academic consensus on an 
issue that was not on the front burner 
at the time. 
But because this impeachment di-
rectly raises the issue of whether 
criminal behavior is required, I have 
gone back and read all the relevant his-
torical material, as nonpartisan aca-
demics should always do, and have now 
concluded that the Framers did intend 
to limit the criteria for impeachment 
to criminal-type acts akin to treason, 
bribery, and they certainly did not in-
tend to extend it to vague and open- 
ended and noncriminal accusations 
such as abuse of power and obstruction 
of Congress. 
I published this academic conclusion 
well before I was asked to present the 
argument to the Senate in this case. 
My switch in attitude, purely aca-
demic, purely nonpartisan. 
Nor am I the only participant in this 
proceeding who has changed his mind. 
Several Members of Congress, several 
Senators expressed different views re-
garding the criteria for impeachment 
when the subject was President Clinton 
than they do now. 
When the President was Clinton, my 
colleague and friend Professor Lau-
rence Tribe, who is advising Speaker 
PELOSI now, wrote that a sitting Presi-
dent could not be charged with a crime. 
Now he has changed his mind. That is 
what academics do and should do, 
based on new information. 
If there are reasonable doubts about 
the intended meaning of ‘‘high crimes 
and misdemeanors,’’ Senators might 
consider resolving these doubts by ref-
erence to the legal concept known as 
lenity. 
Lenity goes back to hundreds of 
years before the founding of our coun-
try and was a concept in Great Britain, 
relied upon by many of our own Jus-
tices and judges over the years. It was 
well known to the legal members of the 
founding generations. 
It required that in construing a 
criminal statute that is capable of 
more than one reasonable interpreta-
tion, the interpretation that favors the 
defendant should be selected unless it 
conflicts with the intent of the statute. 
It has been applied by Chief Justice 
Marshall, 
Justice 
Oliver 
Wendell 
Holmes, Felix Frankfurter, Justice 
Antonin Scalia and others. 
Now, applying that rule to the inter-
pretation of ‘‘high crimes and mis-
demeanors’’ would require that these 
words be construed narrowly to require 
criminal-like conduct akin to treason 
and bribery rather than broadly to en-
compass abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress. 
In other words, if Senators are in 
doubt about the meaning of ‘‘high 
crimes and misdemeanors,’’ the rule of 
lenity should incline them toward ac-
cepting a narrower rather than a broad 
interpretation, a view that rejects 
abuse of power and obstruction of Con-
gress as within the constitutional cri-
teria. 
Now, even if the rule of lenity is not 
technically 
applicable 
to 
impeach-
ment—that is a question—certainly, 
the policies underlying that rule are 
worthy and deserving of consideration 
as guides to constitutional interpreta-
tion. 
Now, here I am making, I think, a 
very important point. Even if the Sen-
ate were to conclude that a technical 
crime is not required for impeachment, 
the critical question remains—and it is 
the question I now want to address my-
self to—do abuse of power and objec-
tion of Congress constitute impeach-
able offenses? 
The relevant history answers that 
question clearly in the negative. Each 
of these charges suffers from the vice 
of being ‘‘so vague a term that they 
will be equivalent of tenure at the 
pleasure of the Senate,’’ to quote again 
the Father our Constitution. 
Abuse of power is an accusation eas-
ily 
leveled 
by 
political 
opponents 
against controversial presidents. In our 
long history, many Presidents have 
been accused of abusing their power. I 
will now give you a list of Presidents 
who in our history have been accused 
of abusing their power and who would 
be subject to impeachment under the 
House managers’ view of abuse: George 
Washington, for refusal to turn over 
documents relating to the Jay Treaty; 
John Adams for signing and enforcing 
the Alien and Sedition laws; and Thom-
as Jefferson, for purchasing Louisiana 
without congressional authorization. 
I will go on—John Quincy Adams; 
Martin Van Buren; John Tyler, ‘‘arbi-
trary, despotic and corrupt use of the 
veto power’’; James Polk—and here I 
quote Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lin-
coln accused Polk of abusing the power 
of his office, ‘‘contemptuously dis-
regarding the Constitution, usurping

the role of Congress, and assuming the 
role of dictator.’’ He didn’t seek to im-
peach him, just sought to defeat him. 
Abraham Lincoln was accused of 
abusing his power for suspending the 
writ of habeas corpus during the Civil 
War; President Grant, Grover Cleve-
land, William McKinley, Theodore Roo-
sevelt, William Taft, Woodrow Wilson, 
Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, 
Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan—con-
cerning Iran-Contra, and now I say, 
Professor Laurence Tribe said the fol-
lowing: ‘‘Therein lies what appears to 
be the most serious breach of duty by 
the President, a breach that may well 
entail 
an 
impeachable 
abuse 
of 
power’’—George H.W. Bush, ‘‘The fol-
lowing was released today by the Clin-
ton-Gore campaign: In the past weeks, 
Americans have begun to learn the ex-
tent to which George Bush and his ad-
ministration have abused their govern-
mental power for political purposes.’’ 
That is how abuse of power should be 
used, as campaign rhetoric. It should 
be issued as statements of one political 
party against the other. That is the na-
ture of the term. Abuse of power is a 
political weapon, and it should be lev-
eled against political opponents. Let 
the public decide if that is true. 
Barack Obama, the House Committee 
on the Judiciary held an entire hearing 
entitled 
‘‘Obama 
Administration’s 
Abuse of Power.’’ 
By the standards applied to earlier 
Presidents, nearly any controversial 
act by a Chief Executive could be de-
nominated as abuse of power. For ex-
ample, past Presidents have been ac-
cused of using their foreign policy, 
even their war powers, to enhance their 
electoral prospects. Presidents often 
have mixed motives that include par-
tisan personal benefits, along with the 
national interest. 
Professor Josh Blackman, constitu-
tional law professor, provided the fol-
lowing interesting example: 
In 1864, during the height of the Civil War, 
President Lincoln encouraged General Wil-
liam Sherman to allow soldiers in the field 
to return to Indiana to vote. 
What was Lincoln’s primary motiva-
tion, the professor asks. 
He wanted to make sure that the govern-
ment of Indiana remained in the hands of Re-
publican loyalists who would continue the 
war until victory. Lincoln’s request risked 
undercutting the military effort by depleting 
the ranks. Moreover, during this time, sol-
diers in the remaining States faced greater 
risks than did the returning Hoosiers. 
The professor continues: 
Lincoln had personal motives. Privately, 
he sought to secure victory for his party; but 
the President, as a President and as a party 
leader and Commander in Chief made a deci-
sion with life-or-death consequences. 
Professor Blackman used the fol-
lowing relevant conclusion from this 
and other historical events. He said: 
Politicians routinely promote the under-
standing of the general welfare while at the 
back of their minds considering how these 
actions will affect their popularity. Often 
the two concepts overlap. What is good for 
the country is good for the official’s reelec-
tion. All politicians understand that dy-
namic. 
Like all human beings, Presidents 
and other politicians, persuade them-
selves that their actions seen by their 
opponents as self-serving are primarily 
in the national interest. In order to 
conclude that such mixed-motive ac-
tions constitute an abuse of power, op-
ponents must psychoanalyze the Presi-
dent and attribute to him a singular, 
self-serving motive. Such a subjective 
probing of motives cannot be the legal 
basis for a serious accusation of abuse 
of power that could result in the re-
moval of an elected President. 
Yet this is precisely what the man-
agers are claiming. Here is what they 
said: ‘‘Whether the President’s real 
reason, the one actually in his mind, 
are at the time legitimate.’’ 
What a standard, what was in the 
President’s 
mind—actually 
in 
his 
mind? What was the real reason? Would 
you want your actions to be probed for 
what was ‘‘the real reason’’ why you 
acted? Even if a President were—and it 
clearly shows in my mind that the 
Framers could not have intended this 
psychoanalytical approach to Presi-
dential motives to determine the dis-
tinction between what is impeachable 
and what is not. 
Here, I come to a relevant and con-
temporaneous issue: Even if a Presi-
dent—any President—were to demand a 
quid pro quo as a condition to sending 
aid to a foreign country—obviously a 
highly disputed matter in this case— 
that would not, by itself, constitute an 
abuse of power. 
Consider the following hypothetical 
case that is in the news today as the 
Israeli Prime Minister comes to the 
United States for meetings. Let’s as-
sume a Democratic President tells 
Israel that foreign aid authorized by 
Congress will not be sent or an Oval Of-
fice meeting will not be scheduled un-
less the Israelis stop building settle-
ments—quid pro quo. I might dis-
approve of such a quid pro quo demand 
on policy grounds, but it would not 
constitute an abuse of power. 
Quid pro quo alone is not a basis for 
abuse of power. It is part of the way 
foreign policy has been operated by 
Presidents since the beginning of time. 
The claim that foreign policy decisions 
can be deemed abuses of power based 
on subjective opinions about mixed or 
sole motives that the President was in-
terested only in helping himself dem-
onstrate the dangers of employing the 
vague, subjective, and politically mal-
leable phrase ‘‘abuse of power’’ as a 
constitutionally permissible criteria 
for the removal of a President. 
Now, it follows from this that, if a 
President—any 
President—were 
to 
have done what ‘‘The Times’’ reported 
about the content of the Bolton manu-
script, that would not constitute an 
impeachable offense. Let me repeat it. 
Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even 
if true, would rise to the level of an 
abuse of power or an impeachable of-
fense. That is clear from the history. 
That is clear from the language of the 
Constitution. You cannot turn conduct 
that is not impeachable into impeach-
able conduct simply by using words 
like ‘‘quid pro quo’’ and ‘‘personal ben-
efit.’’ 
It is inconceivable that the Framers 
would have intended so politically 
loaded and promiscuously deployed a 
term as ‘‘abuse of power’’ to be 
weaponized as a tool of impeachment. 
It is precisely the kind of vague, open- 
ended, and subjective term that the 
Framers feared and rejected. 
Consider the term ‘‘maladministra-
tion.’’ I want to get back to that term 
because it was a term explicitly re-
jected by the Framers. Recall that it 
was raised, Madison objected to it, and 
it was then withdrawn, and it was not 
a part of the criteria. We all agree that 
maladministration is not a ground for 
impeachment. If the House were to im-
peach on maladministration, it would 
be placing itself above the law. There is 
no doubt about that because the Fram-
ers explicitly rejected maladministra-
tion. 
Now what is maladministration? It is 
comparable in many ways to abuse of 
power. Maladministration has been de-
fined as ‘‘abuse, corruption, misrule, 
dishonesty, misuse of office, and mis-
behavior.’’ Professor Bowie in his arti-
cle in today’s ‘‘New York Times’’ 
equates abuse of power with ‘‘mis-
conduct in office’’—misconduct in of-
fice—thus supporting the view that, 
when the Framers rejected maladmin-
istration, they also rejected abuse of 
power as a criteria for impeachment. 
Blackstone denominated maladmin-
istration as a ‘‘high misdemeanor’’ 
that is punishable ‘‘by the method of 
parliamentary impeachment, wherein 
such penalties, short of death, are in-
flicted.’’ He included among those im-
prisonment. In other words, you can go 
to prison for maladministration. De-
spite this British history, Madison in-
sisted it be rejected as a constitutional 
criteria for impeachment because ‘‘so 
vague a term will be equivalent to a 
tenure during pleasure of the Senate,’’ 
and it was subsequently rejected and 
withdrawn by its sponsor. 
This important episode in our con-
stitutional history supports the con-
clusion that the Framers did not ac-
cept, whole hog, the British approach 
to impeachment as some have mistak-
enly argued. Specifically, they rejected 
vague and open-ended criteria, even 
those that carried the punishment of 
imprisonment in Britain because they 
did not want to turn our new Republic 
into a parliamentary-style democracy 
in which the Chief Executive could be 
removed from office simply by a vote 
of nonconfidence. That is what they 
didn’t want. 
Sure, nobody was above the law, but 
they created a law. They created a law 
by which Congress could impeach, and 
they did not want to expand that law 
to include all the criteria that per-
mitted impeachment in Great Britain. 
The Framers would never have in-
cluded and did not include abuse of

power as an enumerated and defined 
criteria for impeachment. By expressly 
rejecting maladministration, they im-
plicitly rejected abuse. 
Nor would the Framers have included 
obstruction of Congress as among the 
enumerated defined criteria—it, too, is 
vague and indefinable, especially in a 
constitutional system in which, ac-
cording to Hamilton in Federalist No. 
78, ‘‘the legislative body’’ is not them-
selves ‘‘the constitutional judge of 
their own powers’’ and the ‘‘construc-
tion they put on them’’ is not ‘‘conclu-
sive upon other departments.’’ Instead, 
he said, ‘‘the courts were designed as 
an intermediate body between the peo-
ple [as declared in the Constitution] 
and the legislature’’ in order ‘‘to keep 
the latter within the limits assigned to 
their authority.’’ 
Under our system of separation of 
powers and checks and balances, it can-
not be an ‘‘obstruction of Congress’’ for 
a President to demand judicial review 
of legislative subpoenas before they are 
complied with. The legislature is not 
the ‘‘Constitutional judge of their own 
powers,’’ including the power to issue 
subpoenas. The courts were designated 
to resolve disputes between the execu-
tive and legislative branches, and it 
cannot be obstruction of Congress to 
invoke the constitutional power of the 
courts to do so. 
By their very nature, words like 
‘‘abuse of power’’ and ‘‘obstruction of 
Congress’’ are standardless. It is impos-
sible to put standards into words like 
that. Both are subjective matters of de-
gree and amenable to varying powers of 
interpretations. It is impossible to 
know in advance whether a given ac-
tion will subsequently be deemed to be 
on one side or the other of the line. In-
deed, the same action with the same 
state of mind can be deemed abusive or 
obstructive when done by one person 
but not when done by another. That is 
the essence of what the rule of law is 
not, when you have a criteria that can 
be applied to one person in one way and 
another person in another way and 
they both fit within the terms ‘‘abuse 
of power.’’ 
A few examples will illustrate the 
dangers of standardless impeachment 
criteria. My friend and colleague Pro-
fessor Noah Feldman argued that a 
tweet containing what he believed false 
information could ‘‘get the current 
President impeached if it is part of a 
broader course of conduct’’—a tweet. 
Professor Allan Lichtman has argued 
that the President could be impeached 
based on his climate change policy, 
which he regards as ‘‘a crime against 
humanity.’’ I have to tell you, I dis-
agree with our President’s climate 
change policy, as I do many of his 
other policies, but that is not a criteria 
for impeachment. That is a criteria for 
deciding who you are going to vote for. 
If you don’t like the President’s poli-
cies on climate change, vote for the 
other candidate. Find a candidate who 
has better policies on climate change. 
If 
you 
don’t 
like 
the 
President’s 
tweets, find somebody who doesn’t 
tweet. That will be easy. But don’t 
allow your subjective judgments to de-
termine what is and is not an impeach-
able offense. Professor Tribe, as I men-
tioned, argued that under the criteria 
of abuse of power, President Ronald 
Reagan should have been impeached. 
Would any American today accept a 
legal system in which prosecutors 
could charge a citizen with abuse of 
conduct? Can you imagine, abuse of 
conduct? Fortunately, we have con-
stitutional protections against a stat-
ute that ‘‘either forbids or requires the 
doing of an act in terms so vague that 
men and women of common intel-
ligence must necessarily guess at its 
meaning and differ as to its applica-
tion.’’ It is very difficult to imagine 
criteria that fits this description of 
what the Supreme Court has said vio-
lates the first essential rule of due 
process more closely than abuse of 
power and obstruction of Congress. 
Another constitutional rule of con-
struction is that, when words can be in-
terpreted 
in 
an 
unconstitutionally 
vague manner or a constitutional pre-
cise manner, the latter must be chosen. 
You are entitled to use that rule of in-
terpretation as well in deciding wheth-
er or not obstruction of Congress or 
abuse of power can be defined as fitting 
within the criteria of high crimes and 
misdemeanors. 
For the Senate to remove a duly- 
elected President on vague, noncon-
stitutional grounds, such as abuse of 
power 
or 
obstruction 
of 
Congress, 
would create a dangerous precedent 
and ‘‘be construed,’’ in the words of 
Senator James N. Grimes, ‘‘into ap-
proval of impeachment as part of fu-
ture political machinery.’’ 
This is a realistic threat to all future 
Presidents who serve with opposing 
legislative majorities that could easily 
concoct vague charges of abuse or ob-
struction. The fact that a long list of 
Presidents who were accused of abuse 
of power were not impeached dem-
onstrates how selectively this term has 
and can be used in the context of im-
peachment. 
I am sorry, House managers, you just 
picked the wrong criteria. You picked 
the most dangerous possible criteria to 
serve as a precedent for how we super-
vise and oversee future Presidents. The 
idea of abuse of power and obstruction 
of Congress are so far from what the 
Framers had in mind that they so 
clearly violate the Constitution and 
would place Congress above the law. 
Nor are these vague, open-ended, and 
unconstitutional Articles of Impeach-
ment that were charged here—they are 
not saved by the inclusion in these ar-
ticles of somewhat more specific but 
still not criminal-type conduct. The 
specifications are themselves vague, 
open-ended, and do not charge im-
peachable offenses. They include such 
accusations as compromising national 
security, abusing the power of the 
Presidency, and violating his oath of 
office. 
In any event, it is the actual articles 
that charge abuse of power and ob-
struction of justice—neither of which 
are in the Constitution. It is the actual 
articles on which you must all vote, 
not on the more specific list of means 
included in the text of the articles. 
An analogy to a criminal indictment 
might be helpful. If a defendant were 
accused of dishonesty, committing the 
crime of dishonesty, it wouldn’t matter 
that the indictment listed as well the 
means toward dishonesty, a variety of 
far more specific potential offenses. 
Dishonesty is simply not a crime. It is 
too broad a concept. It is not in the 
statute. It is not a crime. The indict-
ment would be dismissed because dis-
honesty is a sin and not a crime, even 
if the indictment included a long list of 
more specific acts of dishonesty. 
Nor can impeachment be based on a 
bunching together of nonimpeachable 
sins, none of which, standing alone, 
meet the constitutional criteria. Only 
if at least one constitutionally author-
ized offense is proved can the Senate 
then consider other conduct in deciding 
the discretionary issue of whether re-
moval is warranted. 
In other words, your jurisdiction is 
based on commission of an impeach-
able offense. Once that jurisdictional 
element is satisfied, you have broad 
discretion to determine whether re-
moval is warranted, and you can con-
sider a wide array—a wide array—of 
conduct, criminal and noncriminal. 
But you have no jurisdiction to remove 
unless there is at least one impeach-
able offense within the meaning of high 
crimes and misdemeanors. 
In the 3 days of argument, the House 
managers tossed around words even 
vaguer and more open-ended than 
‘‘abuse’’ and ‘‘obstruction’’ to justify 
their case for removal. These words in-
clude ‘‘trust,’’ ‘‘truth,’’ ‘‘honesty,’’ and 
finally 
‘‘right.’’ 
These 
aspirational 
words of virtue are really important, 
but they demonstrate the failure of the 
managers to distinguish alleged polit-
ical sins from constitutionally im-
peachable offenses. 
We all want our Presidents and other 
public officials to live up to the highest 
standards set by Washington and Lin-
coln, although both of them were ac-
cused of abuse of power by their polit-
ical opponents. 
The Framers could have demanded 
that all Presidents must meet Con-
gressman SCHIFF’s standards of being 
honest, 
trustworthy, 
virtuous, 
and 
right in order to complete their terms, 
but they didn’t because they under-
stand human fallibility. As Madison 
put it, ‘‘If men were angels, no govern-
ment would be necessary,’’ and then, 
speaking of Presidents and other public 
officials, ‘‘If angels were to govern 
men, neither internal nor external con-
trols on government would be nec-
essary.’’ 
The Framers understood that if they 
set the criteria for impeachment too 
low, few Presidents would serve their 
terms. Instead, their tenure would be

January 27, 2020 
at the pleasure of the legislature, as it 
was and still is in Britain. So they set 
the standards and the criteria high, re-
quiring not sinful behavior—not dis-
honesty, 
distrust, 
or 
dishonor—but 
treason, bribery, or other high crimes 
and misdemeanors. 
I end this presentation today with a 
nonpartisan plea for fair consideration 
of my arguments and those made by 
counsel and managers on both sides. I 
willingly acknowledge that the aca-
demic consensus is that criminal con-
duct is not required for impeachment 
and that abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress are sufficient. I have 
read and respectfully considered the 
academic work of my many colleagues 
who disagree with my view and the few 
who accept it. I do my own research, 
and I do my own thinking, and I have 
never bowed to the majority on intel-
lectual or scholarly matters. 
What concerns me is that during this 
impeachment proceeding, there have 
been few attempts to respond to my ar-
guments and other people’s arguments 
opposed to the impeachment of this 
President. Instead of answering my ar-
guments and those of Justice Curtis 
and Professor Bowie and others on 
their merits and possible demerits, 
they have simply been rejected with 
negative epithets. 
I urge the Senators to ignore these 
epithets and to consider the arguments 
and counterarguments on their merits, 
especially those directed against the 
unconstitutional vagueness of abuse of 
power and obstruction of Congress. 
I now offer a criteria for evaluating 
conflicting arguments. The criteria 
that I offer I have long called the ‘‘shoe 
on the other foot’’ test. It is a collo-
quial variation of the test proposed by 
the great legal and political thinker, 
my former colleague, John Rawls. It is 
simple in its statement but difficult in 
its application. 
As a thought experiment, I respect-
fully urge each of you to imagine that 
the person being impeached were of the 
opposite party of the current President 
but that in every other respect, the 
facts were the same. 
I have applied this test to the con-
stitutional arguments I am offering 
today. I would be making the same 
constitutional arguments in opposition 
to the impeachment on these two 
grounds regardless of whether I voted 
for or against the President and re-
gardless of whether I agreed or dis-
agreed with his or her policies. Those 
of you who know me know that is the 
absolute truth. I am nonpartisan in my 
application of the Constitution. Can 
the same can be said for all of my col-
leagues who support this impeachment, 
especially those who opposed the im-
peachment of President Bill Clinton? 
I first proposed the shoe test 20 years 
ago in evaluating the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Bush v. Gore, asking the 
Justices to consider how they would 
have voted had it been Candidate Bush, 
rather than Gore, who was several hun-
dred votes behind and seeking a re-
count. In other words, I was on the 
other side of that issue. I thought the 
Supreme Court in that case favored the 
Republicans over the Democrats, and I 
asked them to apply the ‘‘shoe on the 
other foot’’ test. 
I now respectfully ask this distin-
guished Chamber to consider that heu-
ristic test in evaluating the arguments 
you have heard in this historic Cham-
ber. It is an important test because 
how you vote on this case will serve as 
a precedent for how other Senators of 
different 
parties, 
different 
back-
grounds, 
and 
different 
perspectives 
vote in future cases. 
Allowing a duly-elected President to 
be 
removed 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
standardless, subjective, ever-changing 
criteria—abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress—risks being ‘‘con-
strued,’’ in the words of Senator 
Grimes, a Republican Senator from 
Iowa, who voted against impeaching 
President Andrew Johnson, ‘‘into ap-
proval of impeachments as part of fu-
ture political machinery.’’ 
As I began, I will close. I am here 
today because I love my country. I love 
the country that welcomed my grand-
parents and made them into great pa-
triots and supporters of the freest and 
most wonderful country in the history 
of the world. I love our Constitution— 
the greatest and most enduring docu-
ment in the history of human kind. 
I respectfully urge you not to let 
your feelings about one man—strong as 
they may be—establish a precedent 
that would undo the work of our 
Founders, injure the constitutional fu-
ture of our children, and cause irrep-
arable damage to the delicate balance 
of our system of separation of powers 
and checks and balances. 
As Justice Curtis said during the 
trial of Andrew Johnson, a greater 
principle is at stake than the fate of 
any particular President. The fate of 
future Presidents of different parties 
and policies is also at stake, as is the 
fate of our constitutional system. The 
passions and fears of the moment must 
not blind us to our past and to our fu-
ture. 
Hamilton predicted that impeach-
ment would agitate the passions of the 
whole community and enlist all their 
animosities, partialities, influence, and 
interest on one or the other. The Sen-
ate—the Senate—was established as a 
wise and mature check on the passions 
of the moment with ‘‘a deep responsi-
bility to future times.’’ 
I respectfully urge the distinguished 
Members of this great body to think 
beyond the emotions of the day and to 
vote against impeaching on the uncon-
stitutional articles now before you. To 
remove a duly-elected President and to 
prevent the voters from deciding his 
fate on the basis of these articles would 
neither do justice to this President nor 
to our enduring Constitution. There is 
no conflict here. Impeaching would 
deny both justice to an individual and 
justice to our Constitution. 
I thank you for your close attention. 
It has been a great honor for me to ad-
dress this distinguished body on this 
important matter. Thank you so much 
for your attention. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
I am sorry. Are you complete? 
Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Majority Leader MCCONNELL, 
Democratic Leader SCHUMER, Senators, 
don’t worry, this won’t take very long. 
We are going to stop for the day, and 
we will continue with our presen-
tations tomorrow. I just had three ob-
servations that I wanted to briefly 
make for you. 
First of all, thank you very much, 
Professor Dershowitz and all the pre-
senters from our side today. 
I was sitting here listening to Pro-
fessor Dershowitz, and believe it or 
not, my mind went back to law school, 
and I began thinking, how would this 
impeachment look as a law school hy-
pothetical question on an exam? How 
would we answer that question? And I 
found myself thinking maybe that is a 
good way to think about it. 
The question would go something 
like this: Imagine you are a U.S. Sen-
ator and you are sitting in an impeach-
ment trial. The Articles of Impeach-
ment before you had been passed on a 
purely partisan basis for the first time 
in history. In fact, there was bipartisan 
opposition to the Articles of Impeach-
ment. They have been trying to im-
peach the President from the moment 
of his inauguration for no reason—just 
because he won. 
The articles before you do not allege 
a crime or even any violation of the 
civil law. One article alleges obstruc-
tion of Congress simply for exercising 
longstanding constitutional rights that 
every President has exercised. The 
President was given no rights in the 
House of Representatives. The Judici-
ary Committee conducted only 2 days 
of hearings. 
You are sitting through your sixth 
day of trial. The House is demanding 
witnesses from you that they refused 
to seek themselves. When confronted 
with expedited court proceedings re-
garding subpoenas they had issued, 
they actually withdrew those sub-
poenas. 
They are now criticizing you in 
strong, accusatory language if you 
don’t capitulate to their unreasonable 
demands and sit in your seats for 
months. An election is only months 
away, and for the first time in history, 
they are asking you to remove a Presi-
dent from the ballot. They are asking 
you to do something that violates all 
past historical precedents that you 
have studied in class and principles of 
democracy and take the choice away 
from the American people. It would 
tear apart the country for generations 
and change our constitutional system 
forever. 
Question: What should you do? 
Your first thought might be, that is 
not a realistic hypothetical. That could 
never happen in America.

But then you would be happy because 
you would have an easy answer and you 
can be done with your law school exam, 
and it would be—you immediately re-
ject the Articles of Impeachment. 
Bonus question: Should your answer 
depend on your political party? 
Answer: No. 
My second observation is, I actually 
think it is very instructive to watch 
the old videos from the last time this 
happened, when many of you were 
making 
so 
eloquently—more 
elo-
quently than we are—the points that 
we are making about the law and 
precedent. But that is not playing a 
game of ‘‘gotcha’’; that is paying you a 
compliment. 
You were right about those prin-
ciples. You were right about those 
principles. And if you will not listen to 
me, I urge you to listen to yourselves. 
You were right. 
The third observation I had sitting 
here today is, Judge Starr talked about 
that we are in the age of impeachment, 
in the age of constant investigations. 
Imagine—imagine—if all of that energy 
were being used to solve the problems 
of the American people. Imagine if the 
age of impeachment were over in the 
United States. Imagine that. 
I 
was 
listening 
to 
Professor 
Dershowitz talking about the shoe-on- 
the-other-foot rule, and it makes a lot 
of sense. I would maybe put it dif-
ferently. I would maybe call it the 
golden rule of impeachment. For the 
Democrats, the golden rule could be, do 
unto Republicans as you would have 
them do unto Democrats. And hope-
fully we will never be in another posi-
tion in this country where we have an-
other impeachment but vice versa for 
that rule. 
Those are my three observations. I 
hope that is helpful. Those were the 
thoughts I had listening to the presen-
tations. 
At the end of the day, the most im-
portant thought is this: This choice be-
longs to the American people. They 
will get to make it months from now. 
The Constitution and common sense 
and all of our history prevent you from 
removing the President from the bal-
lot. There is no basis for it in the facts. 
There is simply no basis for it in the 
law. I urge you to quickly come to that 
conclusion so we can go have an elec-
tion. 
Thank you very much for your atten-
tion. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized.

Cities Veterinary Hospital is highly involved in 
the community, conducting an annual Shelter 
Supply Drive to support the local shelter pets. 
The practice’s mission is ‘‘to promote respon-
sible pet ownership, to communicate compas-
sionately as we educate our clients, and to 
nurture a longer, more comfortable, and better 
quality of life for our patients.’’ 
Glove Cities Veterinary Hospital is a staple 
of the Gloversville community and on behalf of

CELEBRATING LOU MAIELLO’S 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. MAX ROSE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of Mr. Lou Maiello’s 100th 
birthday. 
Born in 1920 to his Italian immigrant parents 
Elena and Benjamin, Lou is the fourth of 
seven siblings. He attended PS 78 and Ben-
jamin Franklin High School, then moved out to 
Idaho as a member of the Civilian Conserva-
tion Corps. 
Eventually Lou moved back to New York 
City to work for a series of construction com-
panies. At the Rockefeller Construction Com-
pany, he met the love of his life, Nancy. 
Nancy and Lou will celebrate their 64th anni-
versary in June. 
Although Lou retired in 1990, he has kept 
himself busy. An avid golfer, Lou won the 
Staten Island Senior League Club Champion-
ship against a man 43 years his junior. He fol-
lowed up his victory a week later with the first 
hole in one of his golfing career. 
During his retirement, Lou learned to paint 
while watching Bob Ross on PBS. His artwork 
now hangs in the homes of his friends and 
family. Lou is also known for his gardening 
skills, often sharing his harvest with the neigh-
bors. 
Lou and Nancy moved to Staten Island in 
1960 from the Bronx. They raised their four 
children, Anne Marie, Barbara, Robert and 
Rick, in Westerleigh. Lou’s children are all 
proud of their father and thrilled to be cele-
brating this huge milestone together, and I ask 
my colleagues in the House to join me in cele-
brating with them. 
I wish Lou a very happy 100th birthday sur-
rounded by his loving family.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize BeyondHome for receiving 
the 2019 Non-Profit of the Year Award from 
the Arvada Chamber of Commerce. 
For 30 years, BeyondHome, formerly Colo-
rado Homeless Families, has been helping 
working families who are experiencing home-
lessness or who are on the verge of becoming 
homeless by helping them through difficult pe-
riods and ultimately to achieve self-sufficiency 
for life. BeyondHome housed its first family in 
December 1988. As of December 2019, it has 
housed 543 families with children. Of those, 
446 
families 
have 
graduated 
from 
BeyondHome achieving full self-sufficiency, in-
cluding purchasing their own homes, grad-
uating from tech schools, colleges or univer-
sities, and increasing their income. 
Today BeyondHome’s specific services in-
clude affordable housing, career development, 
counseling, direct financial assistance and re-
sources, and group classes focused on job 
readiness, nutrition and cooking, parenting or 
recovering from domestic violence. In 2016, 
BeyondHome expanded their services to in-
clude private trauma-informed therapy for par-
ents and children. Every adult served by 
BeyondHome is required to complete courses 
in life skills, parenting, healthy relationships, fi-
nancial literacy and much more. 
BeyondHome continues to play a critical 
role in the lives of working families. Congratu-
lations on this recognition from the Arvada 
Chamber, and I extend my deepest apprecia-
tion for their contribution to our community.

bara V. Spraker Tourism Partner Award. 
Crystal Grove Diamond Mine & Camp-
ground offers visitors a unique and memorable 
North Country camping experience. In the 
mines, visitors can personally sift and dig for 
Herkimer Diamonds, which are only found 
throughout Herkimer County and the Mohawk 
Valley. These diamonds are precious to col-
lectors worldwide and recognized for their 
unique properties and beauty. The grounds 
also attract campers, who are drawn to the 
spacious and quiet upstate setting, which is 
dotted with hardwood trees and traversed by 
the bubbling Timmerman Creek. Billie Jo and 
Joel Davis are on-site managers for both the 
Crystal Grove campsite and mines. The cou-
ple was asked to manage the property by their 
dear friend, owner Marion ‘‘Bessie’’ Bartlett, 
who passed away in January of 2018. The site 
is now owned by Bartlett’s children, Chris-
topher Evans and Madigan Evans Rollins. 
Crystal Grove Diamond Mine & Camp-
ground showcases the natural beauty and 
treasures of the North Country for all to see. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I would 
like to congratulate Billie Jo Davis, Joel Davis, 
Christopher Evans, Madigan Evans Rollins 
and their entire team for this well-deserved 
recognition. I look forward to their future suc-

Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-

a beloved husband, father, and grandfather— 
who passed away on January 19, 2020 at the 
age of 97. Ken was a beloved community 
member who formerly served as the Mayor of 
the City of Torrance in my congressional dis-
trict. 
Born on August 20, 1922 in Torrance, Cali-
fornia, Ken remains the only Mayor of Tor-
rance to have been born in Torrance. After 
graduating high school in 1941, Ken joined the 
U.S. Army Air Corps and served in China,

Burma, and India during World War II. Upon 
the conclusion of the war, Ken returned to his 
education, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts 
from Occidental College. He later received his 
teaching credential from the University of 
Southern California. Shortly after receiving his 
credential, Ken discovered a love for real es-
tate and founded Ken Miller Realty. Ken met 
his wife, Judy, in 1952, and they married that 
same year. 
Ken’s career in local government began with 
his service on the Torrance Planning Commis-
sion from 1960 to 1962. Ken went on to serve 
as a City Councilmember from 1962 to 1970. 
Following his service on the City Council, Ken 
was elected Mayor in 1970. Ken served two 
terms as the Mayor of Torrance, leaving office 
in 1978. 
During his tenure as Mayor, Ken success-
fully spearheaded efforts to impose a two-term 
limit on the mayoral office through changes to 
the City Charter. The City of Torrance also 
owes much of its park space to Ken and his 
efforts to acquire land for public use. While in 
office, Ken helped to establish the Torrance 
Sister City Association, a program that aims to 
foster relationships between two different 
countries. Through his efforts, the City of Tor-
rance developed a relationship with the City of 
Kashiwa, Japan that still exists today. 
After ending his political career, Ken co- 
founded South Bay Bank in 1982, serving as 
a chairman until 2007. Ken’s civic service 
commitments extend to his presidency of the 
Torrance-Lomita Board of Realtors, his board 
membership at Torrance Memorial Medical 
Center, and his presidency of the Switzer 
Center Board of Directors. In 1990, the City of 
Torrance honored Ken with the Jared Sidney 
Torrance Award. 
Ken is survived by his wife, Judy, their three 
children, Randy, Jim, and Cathy, six grand-
children, and one great-grandson, whom I

DWAYNE CAMERON 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dwayne Cameron for re-
ceiving the 2019 Ambassador of the Year 
Award from the Arvada Chamber of Com-
merce. 
Dwayne has shown incredible commitment 
to the Arvada Chamber and the Arvada com-
munity through his role as an Arvada Cham-
ber ambassador. As an ambassador, he con-
sistently attends events and meetings and of-
fers support and a friendly face to other busi-
ness owners. It is clear Dwayne has a deep 
understanding of the local business commu-
nity and is invested in the success of busi-
nesses in Arvada. 
In addition, Dwayne contributes to the Ar-
vada community through his ownership of the 
Minuteman Press, a full-service marketing and 
print and design company based in Arvada. 
With years of experience and unparalleled ex-
pertise in the print industry, Dwayne and his 
staff offer a variety of offerings—from business 
cards and brochures, to labels and cal-
endars—but always reliable service and af-
fordable prices. 
Congratulations to Dwayne for this recogni-
tion from the Arvada Chamber, and I extend 
my deepest appreciation for his contribution to 
our community.

HONORING DR. DEXTER CRISS FOR

CHOIR 
AND THE LIFE OF HIS SON, DAL-
TON CRISS 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Dexter Criss for his work 
with the Plattsburgh State Gospel Choir and 
the life of his son, Dalton Criss. 
Dr. Dexter Criss is an Associate Professor 
of Chemistry and Music Director at SUNY 
Plattsburgh. He has been involved with the 
Plattsburgh State Gospel Choir since 2001. 
The choir actively performs on campus, in the 
community, and throughout the region. They 
average 25 appearances each year in settings 
including colleges, campus events, K–12 
schools, churches, memorial services, wed-
dings, and other community events. For many 
years, Dr. Criss has led the choir during the 
annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Day events. 
Sadly, Dr. Criss is not leading the choir in re-
membrance of Dr. King this year. 
Dr. Criss’ wife Barbara and his son Dalton 
were involved in a serious car accident. On 
August 20th, Dalton tragically passed away 
from his injuries at just 18 years old, while 
Barbara remained in critical condition in Bur-
lington. Dalton had just graduated from Peru 
High School and was planning on beginning 
his first semester at SUNY Plattsburgh the 
very next week. Dalton was an accomplished 
football player and wrestler for Peru High 
School, winning the Section VII title in the 
285-pound class his junior and senior years. 
He also took after his father in his musical 
ability, playing drums and bass for the Faith 
Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church of 
Glens Falls. 
Dr. Criss’ absence is a further reminder of 
this tragedy that has rocked the Plattsburgh 
community. On behalf of New York’s 21st Dis-
trict, I would like to thank Dr. Criss for his 
amazing work and honor the life of his son, 
Dalton. My thoughts and prayers are with him 
and his family.

CELEBRATING THE SERVICE OF 
SANDRA FERNIZA 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate Sandra Ferniza’s service to 
the community of Phoenix. After 5 years of 
working in my District Office as the Director of 
Intergovernmental Relations and Director of 
Constituent Services, Sandra is retiring. I am 
grateful for her many years of dedication to 
our state. 
Constituent casework provides Congres-
sional offices with a unique and vital oppor-
tunity to engage with individuals in the mo-
ments that they need us most. From passport 
applications to grant proposals, Sandra has 
connected with constituents and guided them 
through problem-solving processes, many of 
which involve federal agencies. She has used 
her own wealth of experience and connections 
in all sectors of the Phoenix community to 
help our office and go above and beyond in 
helping our constituents, organizations and 
local government entities. 
In addition to her work in our office, Sandra 
has an illustrious legacy of breaking barriers 
for the Latino community. She has helped 
Latinos win groundbreaking elections at many 
levels of government, provided visibility as a 
Latina leader within the banking and invest-
ment world, and served as the CEO of the Ari-
zona 
Hispanic 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce. 
Throughout her long and varied career, two 
consistencies that stand out are service and 
leadership. Her professional commitment has 
been matched only by her dedication to her 
family and friends. She has selflessly cared for 
multiple ailing family members and serves as 
a model of a value-driven life for her extensive 
network of younger family and friends. 
I am grateful to have worked alongside San-
dra for the entirety of my time in Congress. 
While I wish her only the best in her retire-
ment, she will also be missed. She has been 
an asset and an advocate that I have been 
grateful to have on my team. Her selflessness, 
attention to detail, and determination are re-
markable traits that have allowed her to ad-
vance good in Arizona over the entirety of her 
career. 
On behalf of myself, the countless constitu-
ents of Arizona’s seventh district that she has 
helped, and the entire State of Arizona, I want 
to express my gratitude for the service of San-
dra Ferniza. I have no doubt that she will con-
tinue to be a leader within the Phoenix com-
munity. We will thank her by continuing to 
dedicate ourselves to constituent services and 
the improvement of as many lives as possible.

RESOLUTION 
COMMEMORATING 
THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
LIBERATION OF AUSCHWITZ 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the introduction of a resolution com-
memorating the 75th anniversary of the libera-
tion of Auschwitz. 
Today, International Holocaust Remem-
brance Day, marks the 75th anniversary of the 
liberation of Auschwitz. On this day in 1945, 
Allied troops entered the Auschwitz concentra-
tion camp and liberated the more than 7,000 
still-living prisoners. 
During World War II, the Nazi regime sys-
tematically killed approximately 6 million Jews, 
as well as millions of other minority popu-
lations. At least 1.3 million of these people 
were deported to Auschwitz, 1.1 million of 
whom were murdered. 
Today, we not only remember the Jewish 
lives cut short by the heinous crimes per-
petrated by the Nazi regime, but we honor the

nearly 80,000 Holocaust survivors still living in 
the United States and telling their stories to 
ensure that the adage ‘‘never again’’ is real-
ized. 
Anti-Semites in America and around the 
world continue to invoke Nazi ideology and 
use symbols like the swastika to vandalize 
synagogues and Jewish institutions. This reso-
lution emphasizes the importance of Holocaust 
education in schools, urges Federal agencies 
and the American people to commit to ad-
dressing unchecked intolerance and prejudice, 
and encourages Federal and local social serv-
ices agencies to support Holocaust survivors 
so they may live their remaining years in dig-
nity and comfort. 
I thank my colleagues, Congressmen TED 
DEUTCH and LEE ZELDIN, for leading this bipar-
tisan resolution with me, to the 98 original co-
sponsors of the resolution, and to over a 
dozen American Jewish organizations who 
have endorsed it. 
I urge my colleagues to join with me and 
pass this important resolution.

work in New York and throughout the north-
east. Dollar General has garnered a great rep-
utation for their commitment to the community 
and producing quality products that promote a 
cleaner environment. Strong partnerships are 
key to developing a great workforce, and Dol-
lar General has worked closely with the Am-
sterdam Career Center to recruit and interview 
prospective employees. Additionally, they have 
held successful hiring events that have at-
tracted hundreds of job seekers from the sur-
rounding community. Dollar General has made 
significant contributions to community organi-
zations in the North Country, including $5,000 
to the Workforce Career Center and a dona-

The commitment Dollar General has made

LIMB LOSS AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the importance of Limb 
Loss Awareness Month. Over 2.1 million 
Americans live with limb loss or difference, 
and over 500 Americans lose a limb every 
day. The number of Americans living with limb 
loss or difference is projected to rise to over 
3.6 million by 2050. 
April is an appropriate month to designate 
as Limb Loss Awareness Month as spring is 
a time of renewal and inspiration. I encourage 
everyone to learn about the issues affecting 
people with limb loss and express gratitude to 
families and caregivers who are a source of 
support and motivation. 
Finally, I salute our veterans who have lost 
their limbs in service to this country or in re-
tirement.

KEVIN GARCIA 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Kevin Garcia, Communica-
tions Supervisor at Jeffcom 911, for his excep-
tional performance and contributions to our 
community and for his recognition of an Indus-
try Professional by the NG911 Institute. 
Kevin is one of 20 Communication Super-
visors at Jeffcom 911, overseeing the day-to- 
day operations of a large Communications 
Center and the management of 118 Emer-
gency Communications Specialists. As a dis-
patcher of 23 years, Kevin played a critical 
role in Jeffcom 911’s first 18 months of oper-
ations since launching as the new consoli-
dated regional communications center. Kevin 
was one of the select few line-level personnel 
involved in the integration of eight public-safe-
ty answering point (PSAP) and 24 agencies 
that serve 600,000 residents and produced a 
call volume of 971,254 emergency and non- 
emergency calls. 
Kevin was instrumental in using his experi-
ence for developing organizational policy and 
user guides for a multitude of systems, includ-
ing individual training for major upgrades on 
the ‘Safe-to-Tell’ software—which was particu-
larly time sensitive for informing local School 
Resource Officers of potential threats to staff 
and students within Jefferson County. Kevin 
worked hand-in-hand with the IT department 
with the development and functionality of the 
CAD system at Jeffcom 911 from the start 
when the operations floor was an empty shell 
all the way through construction and set-up to 
the state-of-the-art facility it is today, resulting 
in an enormous resource of information and 
guidance for the 150 Jeffcom 911 staff. In ad-
dition to his technical acumen, Kevin is equally 
valuable to the Jeffcom 911 staff for his lead-
ership in personnel matters and does a tre-
mendous job managing a difficult watch 
schedule, assessment of trainees on the floor 
and providing in-the-moment guidance to em-
ployees on organizational policy, Kevin is truly 
a force-multiplier for management as a leader 
on the operations floor and has solidified him-
self as the ‘‘go-to’’ Supervisor for guidance on 
any issue. 
Over the past year, Kevin has also served 
as an instructor in the Jeffcom 911 Academy, 
a six-week course for training new Emergency 
Communication Specialists, where he has pro-
vided over 40 hours of instruction and brings 
both experience and great passion to the 
training. Congratulations to Kevin for earning 
recognition as an Industry Professional from 
NG911, and I extend my deepest appreciation 
to Kevin Garcia for his leadership and con-
tributions to Jeffcom 911 and the Jefferson 
County community.

Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor CG Roxane LLC for receiving 
the FMS Workforce Development Business of 
the Year award for Fulton County. 
Since 2013, CG Roxane LLC has been bot-
tling and shipping Crystal Geyser Alpine 
Spring Water in a state-of-the-art facility lo-
cated in Johnstown, NY. In addition to the 
Johnstown plant, CG Roxane owns and oper-
ates eight other water bottling plants in New 
Hampshire, 
South 
Carolina, 
Tennessee, 
Texas, Florida, Arkansas, and California. Last 
year CG Roxane became the first U.S. bev-
erage company to open a plant dedicated to 
manufacturing bottles from recycled materials, 
specifically 
recycled 
polyethylene 
terephthalate. CG Roxane’s new bottles will 
soon be made entirely of this recycled mate-
rial; closing the sustainability loop. CG Roxane 
is also dedicated to hiring local. Their North-
east Regional Human Resources Manager, 
Amy McCray, has been working with the 
Workforce Career Center staff in placing job 
seekers. Amy posts her facility’s job openings 
with the centers and has actively attended 
both recruitments and job fairs. 
CG Roxane demonstrates the commitment 
to sustainability and community mindedness 
that the North Country prides itself in. On be-
half of New York’s 21st District, I would like to 
congratulate the entire CG Roxane LLC team 
for this well-deserved recognition. I look for-
ward to their future success.

BIG BEAR LAKE CITY MANAGER 
JEFF MATHIEU RETIRES 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the career and service of Big Bear 
Lake City Manager Jeff Mathieu, who will re-
tire from his position on January 27, 2020. 
Before coming to Big Bear Lake, Jeff 
Mathieu served the cities of Santa Monica and 
Long Beach for a combined 31 years. He 
came to Big Bear Lake in 2006, where he im-
mediately hit the ground running. He has been 
responsible for numerous capital improvement 
projects, including major street improvements, 
the construction of new trails, the upgrade of 
city parks, and the creation of the iconic Boul-
der Bay Park. Additionally, Mathieu spear-
headed the Village Renaissance Project which 
transformed the Village ‘‘L’’ into one of the 
most popular attractions in Big Bear Lake. 
Jeff Mathieu has been an outstanding city 
manager, and I am grateful to have had the 
pleasure of working with him during my entire 
career in Congress and the California State 
Assembly. He truly embodies the term public 
servant, and his leadership, experience, and 
dedication to improving Big Bear Lake will be 
sorely missed.

to the fire service will continue to be an ideal 
of servanthood and integrity for his colleagues. 
Under his leadership, Chief Tittle was re-
sponsible for oversight of the 155 fire fighters 
who compose the Lewisville Fire Department. 
As Fire Chief, he oversaw the department’s 
response to over 11,000 incidences annually 
in the City of Lewisville from eight fire stations. 
Chief 
Tittle 
was 
born 
and 
raised 
in 
Lewisville, and he graduated from Lewisville 
High School in 1974. He played basketball 
and was captain of the varsity baseball team. 
Years later, he was named to the Lewisville 
High School Hall of Fame in recognition of his 
accomplishments both as a student and for his 
public service as an adult. 
Chief Tittle was a ‘‘Fireman’s Fireman;’’ he 
joined the Lewisville Fire Department in 1977 
and worked his way up the ranks, serving in 
nearly every position within the department. 
He had the distinction of being one of the 
city’s first paramedics and fulfilled a lifelong 
dream and reached the pinnacle of his career 
when he was named Lewisville Fire Chief in 
2011. 
Tim Tittle was married to Lisa for more than 
twenty years and raised two sons. According 
to their proud and loving father, these young 
men were the greatest accomplishments of his 
life. Chief Tittle passed away on January 20, 
2020 after a courageous battle against leu-
kemia. 
Since being diagnosed in 2013, he aggres-
sively battled the cancer into remission several 
times. 
His leadership, professionalism and dedica-
tion will not be forgotten in the City of 
Lewisville and Denton County. Chief Tim 
Tittle’s devotion to his profession and his fel-
low firefighters was absolute and his service to 
the community made it a safer place to live 
and work. His service and leadership will be 
deeply missed.

JACK’S & STEAMERS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Jack’s & Steamers for re-
ceiving the 2019 Business of the Year Award 
from the Arvada Chamber of Commerce. 
Jack’s & Steamers owners—Jack and Athan 
Miller and Scott Parker—not only run a suc-
cessfully and lively restaurant and coffee shop 
in Arvada, they also give individuals with de-
velopmental disabilities the opportunity to have 
meaningful employment. Adults with develop-
mental disabilities can gain hands-on experi-
ence and training in their prep kitchen and 
elsewhere in the restaurant. 
From their humble beginnings of two em-
ployees to their current payroll of over 120 
employees, they continue to grow their mis-
sion by offering meaningful employment and 
expanding their business portfolio. One of their 
new business offerings includes A Different 
Kind of Jam, their own line of gourmet spe-
cialty jams, jellies and pie fillings using only 
the freshest natural ingredients. 
Jack’s & Steamers continues to prove it’s 
possible to run an enterprising and sustainable 
business while also focusing on employing 
adults with development disabilities. Congratu-
lations on the recognition from the Arvada 
Chamber, and I extend my deepest apprecia-
tion for their contribution to our community.

HONORING CENTURY LINEN & UNI-

REGIONAL 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CEN-
TENNIAL BUSINESS AWARD 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Century Linen & Uniform for re-
ceiving the Fulton Montgomery Regional 
Chamber of Commerce Centennial Business 
Award. 
Century Linen & Uniform is a legacy com-
pany headquartered in Fulton County since 
1915. The company was founded in Glovers-
ville as Robison & Smith, and the name was 
changed in 2015 to mark a new era for the 
‘‘next 100 years’’ of the company. Today, the 
company has over 400 employees operating 
out of three locations, including a brand-new 
facility in Fulton County. They serve a range 
of customers, including acute healthcare facili-
ties, surgery centers, nursing homes, assisted 
living centers, doctors’ offices and other busi-
nesses throughout New York State and west-
ern Massachusetts. Their weekly laundry out-
put, now at 500,000 pounds, is expected to 
rise to over one million pounds in the future. 
CEO Richard Smith attributes the success of 
Century Linen ‘‘to hard work, consistency with 
our business philosophy, focusing on our core 
values and having a properly trained and edu-
cated workforce.’’ 
Century Linen and Uniform has been pro-
viding jobs and investment to our communities 
for 105 years. On behalf of New York’s 21st 
District, I would like to congratulate Richard 
Smith and the entire Century Linen & Uniform 
for this well-deserved recognition. I look for-
ward to their future success.

MARKING NATIONAL SCHOOL 
CHOICE WEEK 2020 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mark National School Choice Week 
and recognize all the students in Indiana’s 2nd 
District. 
I believe every child in America should have 
access to a high-quality education in a safe 
and welcoming environment. Nothing should 
stand in the way of a child receiving a world- 
class education, and parents should have the 
ability to make decisions about their children’s 
education. 
School choice gives students the oppor-
tunity to find the path to success that works 
best for them, especially in the face of obsta-
cles in their own school district. Look no fur-
ther than the examples set in my community 
in northern Indiana, where students cross dis-
trict lines to attend public schools that offer 
programs not available in their own school dis-
trict. These programs equip students in Indi-
ana with the tools to succeed and set them 
apart from their peers. Hoosier families have 
the freedom to put their children first so they 
can achieve their goals. 
Education is power, and all Americans have 
the right to tap into that power and put their 
best foot forward. It is important that our state 
and local governments are equipped to ensure 
teachers, students, and school administrators 
have the resources and tools they need to 
learn, teach, and grow. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of 2nd District 
Hoosiers, I affirm that National School Choice 
Week is critical in the fight to ensure our chil-
dren have limitless potential and bright futures.

HONORING THE JUVENILE DIABE-

RESEARCH 
FOUNDATION 
FOR 
ITS 
FIFTIETH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize the Juvenile Diabetes Research 
Foundation and its Western New York Chapter 
upon its fiftieth anniversary. For years, this or-
ganization has been the leading global organi-
zation to fund Type One Diabetes research, 
and I am honored to recognize their work 
today. 
Type One Diabetes is an autoimmune dis-
ease that causes the pancreas to stop pro-
ducing insulin suddenly, and has no link to 
diet or lifestyle and impacts both adults and 
children. 
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation 
was founded in 1970 upon the desire to cure 
Type One Diabetes. The organization was 
founded by parents hoping to find a cure for 
their children who had the disease. Since that 
time, the organization has worked to cure this 
disease that affects so many by raising funds 
and advocating for research. Currently, there 
are dozens of locations across the nation and 
six international affiliates. The organization 
has raised more than two billion dollars for re-
search. 
This organization has done great work 
throughout the country, including the Western 
New York Chapter that I have often been in-
volved with over the years. This year, we are 
glad to also be celebrating the Gala’s twen-
tieth anniversary, Journey To A Cure Gala, 
one of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foun-
dation of Western New York’s largest fund-
raisers. This extraordinary event draws about 
six hundred community members together, 
united for the cause of raising funds for Type 
One Diabetes research. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
honor the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foun-
dation and its Western New York Chapter 
upon its fiftieth anniversary.

Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ron Slinger for receiving 
the 2019 Chairman’s Choice Award from the 
Arvada Chamber of Commerce. 
The Chairman’s Choice is selected annually 
by the Chairman of the Arvada Chamber of 
Commerce Board of Directors to recognize a 
member of the community who has shown 
leadership and outstanding support to the Ar-
vada Chamber. 
For more than 10 years, Ron has been a 
staple of the Arvada and Jefferson County 
community. During that time, Ron served as 
Red Rocks Community College’s Vice Presi-
dent of Institutional Advancement, Strategic 
Partnerships and Workforce Solutions as well 
as Associate Vice President for Institutional 
Advancement and Executive Director of the 
Red Rocks Community College Foundation. 
Ron’s extensive involvement, leadership and 
contributions in Arvada have resulted in a sig-
nificant and long-lasting impact in the commu-
nity. His sense of humor and kindness bring 
positive energy and perspective to any oppor-
tunity he undertakes. In addition, Ron posi-
tively impacted the community through active 
and abundant volunteerism, leadership and 
advocacy. He is a true advocate for the Ar-
vada Chamber and has fully dedicated himself 
to the betterment of the community. 
Recently Ron took a new position as Presi-
dent of Miles Community College but has left 
a legacy in our community that will be difficult 
for anyone to fill. Congratulations to Ron on 
this recognition from the Arvada Chamber, 
and I extend my deepest appreciation for his

Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Townsend Leather for receiving 
the Fulton Montgomery Regional Chamber of 
Commerce Edward L. Wilkinson Industry of

Townsend Leather Co., Inc. in Johnstown 
has been offering high-quality leather products 
to its customers for the past 50 years. This 
third-generation-business, founded in 1969 by 
Albert ‘‘Red’’ Kucel, along with his wife Doro-
thy and their children, now employs more than 
160 partners. They maintain 128,000 square 
feet of manufacturing space in three buildings 
on Townsend Avenue, complemented by the 
recent opening of a 62,000 square foot build-
ing on Grove Street. Known by many as ‘‘The 
Stitch,’’ this new space is located in a refur-
bished 1900s knitting mill. Townsend Leather 
Co. offers a wide range of residential, hospi-
tality/hotel and corporate applications including 
jet interiors, as well as for luxury motor coach-
es, show cars and yachts in more than 1,000 
colors, textures, and qualities. 
Townsend Leather Co. is an industry leader 
and reflects the best qualities of the business 
community in the North Country. On behalf of 
New York’s 21st District, I would like to con-

HONORING DR. JAMES DENNIS 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS

Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to

Dr. 
James 
Dennis, 
President 
of 
McKendree University in Lebanon, Illinois, for 
dedicating a quarter century to strengthening 
the school’s mission and expanding its na-
tional profile. 
Born in Los Angeles, Dr. Dennis had teach-
ing in his DNA. With both his parents working 
as teachers, he spent his childhood living on 
a college campus, where he gained his pas-
sion for reading and learning. After receiving a 
Ph.D. in education and a law degree, Dr. Den-
nis began his career at the University of 
Southern California before beginning his ten-
ure at McKendree in 1994. Dr. Dennis has 
helped transform the local college into a large 
university with a high percentage of out-of- 
state and international students. One of Dr. 
Dennis’s most important goals is to create a 
relationship with every student that he can; he 
wants them to understand how much he val-
ues their success. When he’s not focused on 
administration of university, Dr. Dennis enjoys 
traveling and spending time with his five 
grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Dr. James Dennis for his commitment 
to making McKendree University a top des-
tination for young people charting their path 
for a lifetime of success.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
PRO-
MOTING 
HEALTHIER 
LIFELONG 
IMPROVEMENTS 
IN 
FOOD 
AND 
EXERCISE ACT OF 2020 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the Promoting Healthier Lifelong Im-
provements in Food and Exercise Act (LIFE 
Act), which authorizes a national initiative to 
attack a major health problem in the United 
States that cannot be remedied through the 
health care system alone. Increasing rates of 
overweight and obesity are now found among 
Americans of every age, race and major de-
mographic group, and threaten the health of 
Americans like no disease or condition. In fact, 
the key to eliminating many of the most seri-
ous health conditions is not only to reduce 
overweight and obesity, but also to encourage 
exercise of all kinds. 
The LIFE Act would provide $25 million to 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) for a coordinated national effort to 
reverse increasingly sedentary lifestyles and 
diets that are high in fat and sugar. Specifi-
cally, my bill would require the CDC to estab-
lish the first national strategy to combat the 
overweight and obesity epidemic. The CDC, 
either directly or through grants to states or 
local organizations, would train health profes-
sionals to recognize the signs of overweight 
and obesity early in order to educate Ameri-
cans about proper nutrition and regular exer-
cise; conduct public education campaigns 
about how to recognize and address over-
weight and obesity; and develop intervention 
strategies for use in everyday life, such as in 
the workplace and community settings. 
In 2017, estimates from the CDC National 
Center for Health Statistics showed that since 
1971 to 1974, the percentage of children and 
adolescents who are obese has increased 
from 5 percent to 18.5 percent. The CDC also 
reports that Type 2 Diabetes, once considered 
an adult disease, is now widespread among 
children. The rising cost of the health care 
system, including insurance premiums, reflects 
this epidemic. Today, chronic diseases, many 
of which are caused or exacerbated by over-
weight and obesity, account for 70 percent of 
all deaths in the U.S., and 75 percent of U.S. 
medical care costs. A focused national health 
initiative would provide guidance to the states 
to engage in similar programs, as mayors of 
some cities have done. 
A national focus could lead to changes, 
such as greater participation in high school 
physical education classes, which dropped 
from 42 percent in 1991 to 25 percent in 1995 
and has remained constant through 2015. 
Changes in nutrition are equally critical be-
cause more than half of all young people con-
sume too much fat, a factor in the increase of 
overweight youth. Data also show an increase 
in unhealthy eating habits for adults and no 
change in physical activity. 
To cite an example of the need for action, 
the District of Columbia is one of the fittest cit-
ies in the United States, according to a 2019 
study by the American College of Sports Medi-
cine, yet even here, obesity continues to be a 
severe problem. Approximately one-fifth of 
District residents are considered obese. Most 
of the obesity epidemic is exercise-and-food- 
related. 
I urge support of this important bill to mobi-
lize the country now before entirely prevent-
able health conditions, which often begin in 
childhood, overwhelm the nation’s health care 
system.

HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise

Small businesses are the backbone of our

Lana Ruggiero, owner of Ruggiero Realty

cluding as a top producing agent and REAL-

HONORING CINDY DACH 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the achievements of Cindy 
Dach, a leader and visionary entrepreneur in 
Arizona. Throughout her career and in every 
endeavor she takes on, Cindy has always 
been tireless in her pursuit to make our com-
munity a better place for everyone. Cindy’s 
work was recently acknowledged with the 
2019 ATHENA Businesswoman of the Year 
award, an honor from the Greater Phoenix 
Chamber awarded to women who dem-
onstrate excellence in leadership, community 
service, and mentorship. 
That Cindy should be awarded an honor in 
the name of the Greek goddess Athena is fit-
ting. Like Athena, Cindy is a force a nature, 
who lives her life with fearlessness, bravery, 
and authenticity. It was these qualities that led 
her to co-found the Roosevelt Row Commu-
nity Development Corporation. The organiza-
tion revitalized a downtown neighborhood into 
the Roosevelt Row Arts District, now a 
walkable arts district in Phoenix’s urban core, 
nationally known for its arts and cultural 
events, rotating exhibits and wonderful local 
restaurants. 
Most emblematic of her spirit of service is 
Cindy’s role as co-founder and CEO of 
Changing Hands bookstore, a gathering place 
for people all over the Valley to exchange 
ideas. The bookstore has served as a touch-
stone in our community for more than 45 
years, and has hosted presidents and leaders 
including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, 
Jimmy Carter, and Madeline Albright. 
Cindy has also helped inspire a generation 
of young women to build and create in their 
own art studios, craft breweries, and boutiques 
on Roosevelt Row. While Cindy has been a 
pillar of Roosevelt Row for decades, she is 
saving space and a saving grace for women 
in business. Not only does she lend square 
footage of her own properties, but she also 
mentors and actively supports female entre-
preneurs in the arts district. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in cele-
brating Cindy Dach as a leader and entre-
preneur behind the helm of a rising Phoenix. 
I’m grateful for the opportunity to witness her 
work and to call her a friend.

HONORING THE POSITIVE 
COMMUNITY MAGAZINE 
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues in the U.S. House of Representatives 
to join me as I rise to pay tribute to The Posi-
tive Community Magazine for 20 years of pro-
moting African-American culture, values and 
traditions. 
In the late 1990s, Adrian Council, Sr. and 
Jean Nash Wells wanted to change the way 
African Americans were perceived in their 
communities and in the country. They did not 
like the fact that most of the publicity they 
read about African Americans was negative. 
They started a newsletter, called the Good 
Newsletter, and filled it with positive stories 
from black culture. Then they distributed it to 
churches and other popular gathering places 
throughout the northern New Jersey and New 
York area. Eventually, the Good Newsletter 
became the Positive Community Newsletter. 
In 2000, the founders decided to turn their 
newsletter into a magazine, called The Posi-
tive Community, and still contains stories 
about the people, organizations, and compa-
nies that are doing good things in black com-
munities. For example, one of their issues is 
dedicated to college graduation with photos 
and descriptions of the graduates. 
Today, 
The 
Positive 
Community 
has 
evolved into a faith-based lifestyle magazine 
written for African-American consumers in the 
New York and New Jersey market. It con-
tinues to be focused on the good news re-
ported from churches and communities. The 
co-founders initial dream to create a balanced 
medium that accurately reflects the efforts of 
churches, small businesses, corporations, and 
concerned individuals to improve their neigh-
borhoods, towns and cities has become a re-
ality. In addition to the monthly publication, 
The Positive Community co-sponsors church 
and community events that focus on health 
and financial literacy-related issues. 
On New Year’s Day of 2020, the magazine 
hosted the inaugural Great American Emanci-
pation Day Awards Banquet at the historic 
Robert Treat Hotel in Newark, New Jersey to 
celebrate their 20th anniversary. They pre-
sented seven guests with awards to honor 
their commitment to African-American commu-
nities, such as the Torchbearer Award, Serv-
ant Leadership Award, and the Community 
Spirit Award. The event continued the same 
devotion to respect for the audience as the 
magazine has shown to its readers. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my fellow Members 
of the U.S. House of Representatives to join 
me and recognize The Positive Community 
Magazine for its 20-year commitment to posi-
tive publicity for African Americans across the 
country.

HONORING LONNIE GILBERT 
NEFOUSE 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor my friend and fellow veteran, Lonnie 
Gilbert Nefouse, who recently passed away at 
the age of 73 in Carmel, Indiana. 
Early in his life, Lonnie chose a path of 
service to our country. Lonnie defended our 
stars and stripes with the courage and self-
lessness that will continue to make our nation 
great for generations to come. This is evident 
in the many honors he was awarded including 
a Bronze Star Medal and a Purple Heart. 
Not only was Lonnie a patriot, but a pillar of 
our Hoosier community and a true family man. 
He valued spending time with his family and 
served as a role model for future generations 
through his civic leadership and commitment 
to country. 
The Pence family is lucky to have consid-
ered Lonnie a close friend. He was a gen-
erous person who will be remembered fondly 
and greatly missed.

HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Creek’s Edge Elk Farm & 
Crum Creek CSA for receiving the Fulton 
Montgomery Regional Chamber of Commerce 
Agricultural Business of the Year Award. 
Creek’s Edge Elk Farm & Crum Creek CSA 
is a collaboration between two local family 
farms that seek to offer the broader commu-
nity a wide selection of locally-raised, high- 
quality, healthy meats. The farms, owned by 
husband and wife team Israel and Stacy 
Handy of Handy Hills Farm; and Susan Keith 
of Creek’s Edge, work together to market their 
products to customers throughout Montgomery 
and Fulton counties, as well as the Little Falls, 
Cooperstown and Cherry Valley areas. They 
have made significant investments in their 
farms and work tirelessly to ensure that their 
customers have high confidence in their prod-
ucts. Creek’s Edge Elk Farm & Crum Creek 
CSA takes pride being able to provide the 
community with meats from healthy, well- 
cared for animals because as they say, ‘‘not 
everyone is able to raise a steer or pig in their 
backyard.’’ 
Agriculture is an essential component of the 
economy in Northern New York and Creek’s 
Edge Elk Farm & Crum Creek CSA exemplify 
the best of North Country agriculture. On be-
half of New York’s 21st District, I would like to 
congratulate Susan Keith, Israel Handy, and 
Stacy Handy for this well-deserved recogni-
tion. I look forward to their future success.

RECOGNIZING MARTIN FERRELL 
NEVINS 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Martin Ferrell 
Nevins of Elizabeth City, North Carolina on the 
occasion of his 100th birthday. A native of 
Iowa, Mr. Nevins, or ‘‘Matty’’ as he was known 
to friends, enlisted in the Coast Guard in 
1941. During WWII he was a boatswain’s 
mate aboard ships in San Francisco and Alas-
ka. By the end of WWII Marty had advanced 
to Aircraft Structural Mechanic. He retired from 
active duty in 1962 as a Chief Aviation Struc-
tural Mechanic. From 1962 to 1980 he worked 
as a civilian at the Coast Guard Base in Eliza-
beth City, and retired as Superintendent of the 
Aircraft Repair Division. He was then awarded 
the Distinguished Career Service Award for 
his 38 years of service to the Coast Guard. 
After his retirement, Marty enjoyed spending 
more time with his wife Helen. He also volun-
teered with Meals on Wheels, served as an of-
ficer in his Kiwanis Club, and tutored others in 
reading, writing and basic math. Matty was 
quoted as saying: ‘‘If you take something from 
the community, you ought to give something 
back, and Elizabeth City has given us so 
much.’’ 
Unfortunately, Mr. Nevins is predeceased by 
his wife Helen who passed away in 2007 at 
the age of 92; and also by their daughter 
Christine, who lost her courageous battle with 
cancer in 2013. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
this incredible veteran and public servant, Mr. 
Martin Ferrell Nevins.

RECOGNIZING MAJOR THORNTON 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, in celebration 
of Black History Month, I rise today in recogni-
tion of Major Milo Thornton, an exemplary 
constituent of mine and African American Pio-
neer who bas served our community for 23 
years in law enforcement. 
Major Thornton began his career in 1997, 
as a correctional deputy with Saint Lucie 
County’s Sheriff Office, under the leadership 
of the now retired Sheriff Robert ‘‘Bobby’’ 
Knowles. After a year and a half tenure, he 
became a patrolman with the Vero Beach Po-
lice Department. 
Major Thornton quickly rose through the 
ranks, being hired by Sheriff Roy Raymond at 
Indian River County Sheriff’s Office four years 
later, becoming sergeant in 2012, receiving 
assignment to uniform patrol, and in 2016 
being promoted to lieutenant, where he was 
reassigned to criminal investigations. In this 
role, he was afforded the opportunity to attend 
advanced training courses that would prepare 
him for the rest of his career. He worked 
closely with general assignment detectives, 
the narcotics division and criminal analysts to 
get to the bottom of various criminal investiga-
tions. 
In 2017, Sheriff Deryl Loar promoted Major 
Thornton to the rank of captain, reassigning 
him to the Uniforms Operations Division in 
which he oversaw the operations of all men 
and women who patrol the county, special op-
erations, including the K9 Unit, Traffic Unit, 
Agriculture and Marine Unit, among many oth-
ers. Additionally, he worked with dispatchers 
in the Communications Unit and the Victims 
Assistance Unit. 
In 2019 he was again promoted, this time to 
rank of major, where he was to serve in the 
Bureau of Administration. In this position, he 
managed aspects of human resources, infor-
mation technology, homeland security, Judicial 
Services, and the School Resource Unit, just 
to name a few. 
Major Thornton also serves our community 
in many capacities outside of his day job, one 
of which, as an adjunct instructor at Indian 
River State College, his alma mater where he 
earned his Associates and Bachelor’s de-
grees. He has worked within their College of 
Public Safety Training for 14 years now, 
teaching subjects such as Introduction to Law 
Enforcement, 
Criminal 
Investigations, 
and 
Interviewing and Report Writing. 
Major Thornton is a member of the Inter-
national Associations of Chiefs of Police, a 
graduate of the Southern Police Institute’s 
Command 
Officers 
Development 
Course 
(class No. 80) at the University of Louisville, 
and the Florida Department of Law Enforce-
ment Leadership Academy (class No. 28). In 
his free time, Major Thornton serves as volun-
teer board member of several charities and 
non-profit organizations. 
On Tuesday, February 18, 2020 in celebra-
tion of Black History Month, the Indian River 
County Board of Commissioners will honor 
Major Thornton’s longstanding service to the 
community. The Board is dedicated to cele-
brating African American Pioneers in the com-
munity such as Major Thornton, who have 
paved the way for future generations. 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to join me in recognizing 
Major Thornton for his dedication to protecting 
residents and his service to our community.

RECOGNIZING THE PUBLIC SERV-
ICE AND RETIREMENT OF GAIL 
STOLL PATTON 
HON. CAROL D. MILLER 
OF WEST VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Gail Stoll Patton, who is retiring 
from her position as Executive Director of Un-
limited Future Inc. Mrs. Patton has been in-
volved in the start-up of many small busi-
nesses in the Greater Huntington region. She 
is a visionary, a dreamer and has left quite a 
legacy behind for others to enact. She is a 
friend. 
Mrs. Patton is truly a dedicated community 
member whose work has sought to signifi-
cantly benefit the life in Southern West Vir-
ginia and the Tri-State Region surrounding 
Huntington. She is happily married to her hus-
band Paul, and they own their own business, 
Top Hat Ballroom, a social ballroom dance 
studio. She also has two daughters, Phoebe 
and Lydia and two grandsons. 
Mrs. Patton has devoted much of her life to 
ensuring the success of small businesses, es-
pecially those operated by women and people 
of color. In 2018, she was instrumental in se-
curing a $1 million grant from the Rockefeller 
Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative 
to increase economic opportunities in the Tri- 
State area. This grant went toward improving 
the economy of 100 local communities. 
Mrs. Patton has proven time and time again 
that she is a true asset to Huntington and the 
Mountain State. She helped lead the creation 
of The Wild Ramp, a year-round, non-profit 
farmers market-based in Huntington, West Vir-
ginia. It has already helped support countless 
local farmers and producers and revitalize the 
economy in the Central City District. It is be-
cause of people like Mrs. Patton who make 
me proud to represent West Virginia’s Third 
Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally recognize Mrs. 
Patton for this momentous achievement. I ask 
you and my colleagues to join me in sending 
her gratitude and best wishes upon her retire-
ment.

HONORING THE CAMP HILL LIONS 
GIRLS SOCCER TEAM ON THEIR 
UNDEFEATED CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
offer my heartfelt congratulations to the Camp 
Hill Lions Girls Soccer Team for their victory at 
the PIAA Class A State Soccer Championship, 
and for their excellence throughout their 
undefeated, untied, 2019 season. 
Led by Coach Jared Latchford—just named 
the Pennsylvania Soccer Coaches Association 
‘‘Girls Class A Coach of the Year’’—the Lions 
dominated the season, achieving a stunning 
overall record of 25–0–0. 
This is the Lions’ second appearance in the 
State Championship in the last three years. 
They were able to take an early lead in their 
contest against Shady Side Academy, and 
hold it throughout the game. Aggressive and 
selfless offense, vigilant defense, and stellar 
goalkeeping earned the Lions a 2–0 victory, 
and their first State Championship trophy. 
These amazing athletes are the epitome of 
remarkable dedication and discipline, out-
standing skill, exceptional sportsmanship, and 
an unyielding team spirit. Their dedication to 
excellence—to say the least—earned them 
this Championship. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s Tenth Congres-
sional District, I commend and congratulate 
the Camp Hill Lions for their incredible per-
formance. We’re proud of them.

IOWAN 
OF 
THE 
WEEK—DAVID 
WOLNERMAN 
IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF INTERNATIONAL HOLOCAUST 
REMEMBRANCE DAY 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor David Wolnerman, a survivor of Ausch-
witz, Birkenau, and Dachau—and Iowa’s last 
known Holocaust survivor—in recognition of 
International Holocaust Remembrance Day. 
Those extraordinary men and women, like 
David, who survived the Holocaust have 
blessed us by sharing their stories and memo-
rializing their experiences for future genera-
tions so that we never forget. Today, I am en-
tering just part of David’s story into the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD so it may be preserved 
for our children and their children. David was 
born in Poland. When the Nazis invaded, 
David was just 13 years old. He was told he 
needed to report to a work camp in order to 
save his family, including his mother, Hannah, 
his brother, Abraham, and his sister, Gertrude. 
The promise was a false one, as David’s fam-
ily would not survive. 
When David first arrived in Auschwitz, he 
waited in line like so many others did—await-
ing an uncertain fate. Some were selected to 
go left, some selected to go right. David says 
that God gave him the right words to say that 
he was 18 years old, and he was sent to the 
right. Had he told the truth, that he was 13 in-
stead of 18, he would have been sent left with 
the younger children and those who were ill to 
be sent to the gas chamber. David’s survival 
was a miracle. He contacted illnesses like ty-
phus. He was so starved that he weighed 80 
pounds when he was liberated on April 29, 
1945. 
After liberation, he lived in a displaced per-
sons camp in Germany where he met his wife, 
Jennie. Together, they began to physically re-
cover from the malnourishment, but the mental 
scars of concentration camps have never left 
David. 
David and Jennie came to America in 1950. 
They didn’t speak English but began working 
at a printing plant. When they had their two 
sons, Michael and Allen, all David and Jennie 
wanted for them was a good education. Both 
Allen and Michael went to Drake University in 
Des Moines for pharmacy school, and their 
parents followed them to Iowa. In 2016, Jen-
nie passed away at age 91. She often shared 
her memories with Iowa schoolchildren, work-
ing to ensure that her story—and the stories of 
her friends and family who perished—would 
live on. Jennie is remembered for her loving 
and generous spirit, her matzo ball soup, and 
as a loving grandmother and mother. Now 
David remains the last Holocaust survivor in 
Iowa. 
Jennie and David have shared their stories 
and wisdom with Iowans for years. We must 
honor them in return by sharing their stories 
and taking this day to remember the atrocities 
of the Holocaust. We must remember those 
who survived, and those who did not. We 
must remember the sacrifices made by chil-
dren, just like David.

HONORING KELLY MONTANYE FOR 
RECEIVING THE FULTON MONT-
GOMERY 
REGIONAL 
CHAMBER 
OF COMMERCE YOUNG PROFES-
SIONALS OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Kelly Montanye for receiving 
the Fulton Montgomery Regional Chamber of 
Commerce Young Professional of the Year 
Award. 
Kelly Montanye, a Mayfield resident, is Man-
ager of Community Outreach & Volunteer 
Services at Mountain Valley Hospice in Glov-
ersville. Over the course of a year, Ms. 
Montanye successfully rebuilt the volunteer 
program, achieving a five-fold increase in 
membership. As Manager, Kelly orchestrates 
the details of each public event, managing the 
communications and marketing for the organi-
zation. She is also an active volunteer in the 
community, where she has served as a men-
tor to students at HFM PTECH, developed an 
annual fundraising campaign for the NYS Chil-
dren’s Foundation, acted as a Relay for Life 
captain, and served as a Fulton County Habi-
tat for Humanity Board Member. 
Kelly Montanye demonstrates the hard 
working, community minded nature that the 
North Country is known for. On behalf of New 
York’s 21st District, I would like to congratu-
late Kelly for this well-deserved recognition. I 
look forward to her future success. 
HONORING HABEEB QUADRI 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the work and dedication of 
Mr. Habeeb Quadri, an educator and Super-
intendent of the Muslim Community Center 
Academy (MCCA) in Morton Grove and Sko-
kie, Illinois. Mr. Quadri was one of five private 
educators in the country to receive the Na-
tional Distinguished Principal award from the 
National Association of Elementary School 
Principals. 
Habeeb Quadri is recognized for his impor-
tant work in growing the size and status of the 
MCCA and helping the community be wel-
coming and inclusive through education. He is 
also recognized for his work to make MCCA 
one of the first Islamic parochial schools to re-
ceive national accreditation. 
Mr. Quadri is always engaged in the class-
room and with students. He leads a light-
hearted weekly all-school assembly to recog-
nize students for their good deeds and en-
courage acts of compassion. Mr. Quadri sits 
with students in the lunchroom, participates in 
classroom activities, and adds a unique char-
acter to the MCCA. 
In addition to his role as Superintendent of 
the MCCA, Mr. Quadri has had a career com-
mitted to education and inclusivity. He has 
served as an educator for both the Chicago 
Public Schools and Detroit Public Schools sys-
tems. Mr. Quadri has also been a committed 
advocate for the Muslim community, dedi-
cating himself to challenging work in order to 
provide opportunities for Muslim students to 
learn about their identity and engage with their 
community. 
I am proud to have the Muslim Community 
Center Academy in my district and to honor its 
important role in educating both its students 
and the community. 
Habeeb Quadri is a caring, talented, cre-
ative educator and leader, and I deeply admire 
his dedicated effort to provide a home and a 
safe place for Muslim students. His commit-
ment to education, inclusivity, and encour-
aging compassion is honorable. On behalf of 
the constituents of the 9th Congressional Dis-
trict, I thank Habeeb for his service and con-
gratulate him on his award.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
in recognition of National Human Trafficking 
Awareness Month and the dedicated volun-
teers who work to end modern-day slavery. 
As a parent, there is nothing scarier than 
the thought of children being removed from 
their families and trafficked. Oftentimes, when 
we think about human trafficking, we envision 
terrible situations across the globe. According 
to the Texas Attorney General, there are cur-
rently more than 300,000 victims of human 
trafficking just in Texas.

HONORING MARIA 
PAPANASTASSIOU 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the work and dedication of 
Ms. Maria Papanastassiou, a librarian and 
Kids’ World assistant manager at the Arlington 
Heights Memorial Library. Ms. Papanastassiou 
was one of 10 librarians in the country to re-
ceive the national ‘‘I Love My Librarian Award’’ 
for 2019–2020 from the American Library As-
sociation. 
Maria Papanastassiou was nominated by 
her colleagues who felt that through her work, 
families with diverse needs have found a 
home and a welcoming, inclusive place at the 
library. Ms. Papanastassiou works hard to 
help families connect with one another and re-
ceive crucial support. 
Ms. Papanastassiou leads play groups for 
children with Down Syndrome, Cerebal Palsy, 
sensory processing disorders and language 
delays. She organizes creative learning oppor-
tunities such as story boards with felt char-
acters to help with language development, 
crafts for fine motor development, instant 
snow powder for sensory exploration, a circus 
tent for children who require low-sensory envi-
ronments, stepping stones for gross motor 
skills, and activities to facilitate imaginative 
play. And she instituted ‘‘Early Open for Fami-
lies’’ so that children of diverse needs can ex-
perience library exhibits in a quiet setting be-
fore the library opens the door to the public. 
In addition to her service to children with 
special needs, Ms. Papanastassiou created 
meetups for parents, caregivers, and develop-
mental therapists to get together in an informal 
setting. She also leads the Arlington Heights 
Memorial Library’s partnership with C.I.T.Y. of 
Support, a nonprofit that aids families with 
children in therapy. 
My office has worked closely with the Arling-
ton Heights Memorial Library to ensure that 
our shared constituents receive effective and 
efficient assistance. My district staff holds reg-
ular neighborhood office hours in the library. 
Maria Papanastassiou is a dedicated, com-
passionate and creative librarian and I deeply 
admire her conscientious work to provide a 
safe place and learning environment for fami-
lies with diverse needs. On behalf of the con-
stituents of the 9th Congressional District, I 
thank Maria for her service and congratulate 
her on this award.
