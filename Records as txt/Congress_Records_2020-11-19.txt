IN DEFENSE OF GOVERNOR GAVIN 
NEWSOM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise this morning in defense of Gov-
ernor Gavin Newsom, who recently de-
fied his own idiotic COVID edicts as he 
partied at one of the few restaurants 
that has not yet been forced out of 
business. I defend him because he was 
doing what we once all did in a free so-
ciety, make our own decisions over 
what risks we are willing to run and 
what precautions we are willing to 
take 
according 
to 
our 
own 
cir-
cumstances to protect our own health. 
Yes, COVID is a nasty bug, and a 
quarter of a million Americans have 
died while having it, but this isn’t the 
bubonic plague. The CDC’s best esti-
mate is that if you are under 49, your 
chance for surviving COVID, if you get 
it, is 99.92 percent. Even if you are over 
70, you have a 94.6 percent rate of re-
covery. Forty percent who get it, don’t 
even know they have it. And yet we 
have allowed our officials to ruin our 
quality of life over it, destroying 
countless businesses, throwing tens of 
millions into unemployment, robbing 
our children of their educations, and 
shredding our most cherished rights as 
Americans. 
Governor Newsom’s night of partying 
should be a wake-up call for every 
American. 
Every time we step outside our 
homes, the risks that we face multiply. 
A free society assumes that its citizens 
are competent to assess those risks, 
balance them against the avoidance 
costs, and to manage their decisions in 
a generally responsible way. It is called 
common sense, and it is a necessary 
prerequisite for self-government and 
liberty. 
The choices of an octogenarian with 
emphysema might be very different 
from those of a healthy Governor from 
California. Only a fool would claim the 
omniscience to make an informed judg-
ment for every person in every cir-
cumstance in every community. Yet 
sadly, this crisis has revealed that 
fools abound in public office, and that 
a fool with power can quickly become a 
petty tyrant. 
Which brings us back to Governor 
Newsom. These government nannies 
love to tell us that they are just fol-
lowing the science. Well, what does 
this science actually tell us? It tells us 
that COVID poses virtually no risk to 
children but can be severe among the 
elderly. So what did these lockdown 
leftists do? They closed all the schools 
and ordered infected patients into 
nursing homes. 
The science tells us that outdoor 
transmissions of the virus are ex-
tremely rare, and that 80 percent of in-
fections occur in people’s homes. So 
what did these lockdown leftists do? 
They closed our beaches, parks, and 
campgrounds and ordered people to 
stay at home. 
The science tells us that obesity is a 
contributing factor to the severity of 
the 
disease. 
So 
what 
did 
these 
lockdown leftists do? They closed all 
the gyms and kept the liquor stores 
open. 
The lockdowns haven’t saved lives. 
The States with the most stringent 
lockdowns generally have the highest 
mortality rates from COVID. Utah

stayed open while next door, Colorado 
shut down. Utah currently has half the 
COVID 
mortality 
rate 
and 
three- 
fourths the unemployment rate as Col-
orado. But the lockdowns have cost 
countless lives from suicides, drug and 
alcohol abuse, domestic violence, and 
deferred health screenings and treat-
ments. 
Recently, 
Governor 
Newsom 
de-
manded that restaurant diners replace 
their masks after every bite, but also 
minimize the times they are taken off. 
I guess that means you take really big 
bites. Thanksgiving dinners are al-
lowed in California, but only when they 
are held outside, guests are seated 6 
feet apart, and they last no more than 
2 hours. Now it is all right to use the 
bathroom, but only if it is frequently 
sanitized, otherwise presumably you 
will just have to use the bushes. And 
for God’s sake, no singing. 
I have wondered how much longer the 
American people are going to tolerate 
this nonsense. 
So let us not criticize Governor 
Newsom. Perhaps he has just offered us 
all deliverance from his own folly. 
Nor should we criticize the California 
legislators who ignored travel and 
quarantine restrictions to junket in 
Hawaii. Nor should we ridicule Speaker 
PELOSI for choosing not to wear a mask 
in a hair salon that was forced to close 
for the rest of us. 
Good 
for 
them. 
They 
are 
dem-
onstrating by their actions the freedom 
that every American citizen needs to 
reclaim from these very same people. 
The Governor should make his own de-
cisions about running his own life. I 
only ask that he and his ilk would stop 
telling us how to run ours.

HONORING NATIONAL RURAL 
HEALTH DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of National Rural 
Health Day. 
I am proud to represent Arizona’s 
First Congressional District. Our dis-
trict is larger than the State of Illi-
nois, and it is one of the most rural in 
the country. 
Many of my constituents must spend 
hours traveling hundreds of miles to 
access any kind of care, let alone spe-
cialist care. 
This year, the COVID–19 pandemic 
has hit our rural communities espe-
cially hard. 
In March, we passed the CARES Act: 
Sweeping legislation to address the 
coronavirus pandemic and provide re-
lief to struggling healthcare facilities 
workers, families, small businesses, 
and Tribes. 
Within this package, we pushed to in-
clude $8 billion in funding specifically 
for our rural Tribal Nations. We also 
secured over $1 billion to support the 
Indian Health Service in Tribal health 
systems. 
The CARES Act included $200 million 
for new rural telehealth services and 
$3.1 billion in funding for community 
health centers. 
But this is not enough. We need to 
pass a new, comprehensive COVID–19 
package now. 
A TALK ABOUT LIFE 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to divert for a second from what 
I have written here and talk about life. 
When I became a police officer a 
while back, I did it because I wanted to 
save lives. And right now, our doctors 
and our nurses across this country are 
doing that with limited help and with 
the need for more supplies. 
So our businesses are struggling. 
But when I would go to a door and 
knock on that door when I was a homi-
cide investigator and tell someone’s 
loved one that their son or daughter 
had died suddenly through violence, it 
was one of the harshest things I had to 
do in life, and I had to do it way too 
many times. 
And now I sit here almost 4 years and 
see a national emergency declared, and 
month after month after month we 
have not made a decision to help the 
American people again. Families are 
being broken up. We all care about 
families. People are suffering because 
they have lost their jobs. We care 
about that, I know, all of us. 
I know that each and every one of us, 
if we had a family member that was 
about to die, that we would want to be 
there by their side, but also, we would 
do everything we could to save that 
life. And, yet, here we sit as a body, 
and the Senate sits as a body, and the 
administration is here, and month 
after month after month we have failed 
to address these severe problems with-
in our country. 
Whatever Governors do, they do. 
That is because part of the issue is that 
we haven’t provided enough responsi-
bility and direction. 
But the other part of it is that we 
just haven’t gotten our job done. After 
4 years I sit here and look out and 
know that 1,800 fellow Americans died 
yesterday and a thousand more the day 
before and a thousand more the day be-
fore that, and the amount of cases are 
going up and spiraling. Thank God the 
healthcare industry has found some 
ways to help our families. 
But the vaccine is not around the 
corner. It is months away from having 
any impact; months away. And people 
will still die; our fellow Americans. We 
cannot allow this to happen. 
We are going to be going on Thanks-
giving break. Really? I couldn’t com-
prehend it when we left for the summer 
and our fellow Americans were dying. I 
really can’t comprehend going home 
for Thanksgiving and not working as 
hard as I can before that to make sure 
that our American families do not have 
to suffer anymore. 
When I worked in the Chicago neigh-
borhoods as a police officer, people 
were suffering then without this going 
on. And now they are suffering even 
worse. 
This is something that I signed up 
for, to save lives as a police officer, and 
to do that here as much as we can. And 
we should all be going in that direc-
tion. I know you want to. I know we 
want to, but we have to show it. 
We can say to leadership, go leader-
ship and negotiate. Us being here is a 
way of making sure they and our coun-
try know that we care. We care enough 
to not just go away week after week 
after week and not allow the people of 
America to know their leaders are here 
for them. 
f 
HONORING THE WILL OF THE 
PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N) for 
5 minutes. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, on November 3, 
Puerto Rican voters made a clear 
choice to become a permanent part of 
this Union, to become a State in equal 
footing and equal responsibility to the 
50 States. 
As it was done in Alaska and Hawaii, 
voters were asked a straightforward 
question: ‘‘Should Puerto Rico be ad-
mitted as a State of the Union?’’ And, 
yes, an absolute majority voted ‘‘yes.’’ 
Statehood gained more votes than any 
candidate or party ticket on the island. 
I 
was 
the 
most 
voted 
candidate 
islandwide, and statehood still received 
well over 100,000 more votes. 
The people of Puerto Rico have re-
peatedly voted to end territorial sta-
tus. In 2012, voters answered ‘‘no’’ to 
the question on continuing the terri-
torial status on the island, and in all 
votes since then, the majority of bal-
lots for change has favored statehood. 
Mr. Speaker, the people of Puerto 
Rico have democratically chosen what 
their future should be. What is Con-
gress waiting for? 
It is our duty to respect the will of 
the people of Puerto Rico. This is a di-
rect mandate to move to statehood, 
and it is Congress’ responsibility to act 
and do it. Keeping the current condi-
tion cannot be justified by any means. 
There are a lot of assumptions and 
false claims being made by both sides 
of the aisle on the issue of Puerto 
Rico’s statehood—claims that are mis-
taken and only try to invalidate the 
will of the people. 
The American citizens in Alaska and 
Hawaii were not met with proposals to 
try some other different solution or 
meet some special precondition, so why 
should we? 
Congress needs to respond to this 
vote to achieve the goal of getting 
Puerto Rico a legal status where our 
American citizens stand on the same 
footing as those in the rest of the Na-
tion. 
This is the right thing to do. Inequal-
ity is not sustainable. 
For over 100 years our young men and 
women have fought in America’s wars 
side by side with their fellow citizens

November 19, 2020 
from all States, under the orders of a 
Commander in Chief we cannot vote 
for. 
For decades, my predecessors and I, 
lacking a vote on this House floor, 
have had to plead, with no proportional 
delegation, against bureaucracy and 
against both open and tacit discrimina-
tion in Federal programs and funding. 
Puerto Ricans have been a part of the 
great American family for over 120 
years. Puerto Ricans are part of what 
makes the United States what it is 
today. At work, schools, law, business, 
sports, government, and in commu-
nities in every State we contribute to 
the greatness of this Nation, and we 
are proud of that, Mr. Speaker. 
b 1015 
We embrace being Americans, and we 
want to be looked at and treated as 
such by our own government system. 
It is time to get to work to give the 
people of Puerto Rico the equality that 
has been long promised but denied. 
After the discovery of the island, there 
were more than 100 years as a colony of 
Spain and now as a colony of the 
United States. 
This is the time. Let’s do it. Respect 
the will of the people of Puerto Rico to 
become a State, and let’s do it now.

RECOGNIZING LANE LOFTON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, it 
is with great honor and sincere grati-
tude that I rise today to recognize 
Lane Lofton. 
A Mississippi native, Lane grew up in 
the South with his parents, Lynne and 
Bill Lofton, and his brother and sister, 
Will and Lydia Lofton. Not ready to 
part with his Southern roots quite yet, 
he attended Samford University in Ala-
bama, where he began his life in poli-
tics. 
Lane moved from the Alabama dis-
trict operations for House Representa-
tive Bobby Bright to D.C. in 2009. It 
was probably the best move ever be-
cause it was in Washington that Lane 
met and married the love of his life, 
Anna York Lofton. They both have im-
mense love for their two French bull-
dogs, Duey and Shirley. 
After nearly a decade of service in 
government 
relations, 
Lane 
inter-
viewed to be my chief of staff about 2 
years ago. I remember it like it was 
yesterday. It was at the end of a very 
long day of orientation, and he was the 
last interview of the day. I remember 
saying to myself after he left that we 
must have saved the best for last. Ei-
ther that or it was a long day and I was 
overly tired and easily impressed, al-
though I firmly believe that it was the 
former. 
The fact is that there is no one else 
I would rather have by my side over 
these last 2 whirlwind years than Lane 
Lofton. 
Together, we entered the 116th Con-
gress with the Nation’s longest govern-
ment shutdown and ended it with a 
global public health and economic cri-
sis. But no matter the problems at 
hand, Lane worked diligently every 
single day to support our office as we 
passed landmark legislation, fostered 
relationships across the aisle, and then 
sometimes he just reminded me to fix 
my tie. 
A tried and true public servant, Lane 
has always put the needs of others 
first, especially the 20-person office 
that he managed. That team can attest 
that, every single day, even when Lane 
had a bad day, he never showed it. He 
came to work every day with an ear to 
listen, a voice of reason, and a smile on 
his face. He sets an incredible example 
of selflessness in the work that he 
takes on, and he has been an invaluable 
mentor for our younger staffers. 
I look forward to watching the future 
successes that Lane will find in his per-
sonal and professional life. I think that 
his next challenge will be one of his 
biggest because Lane and his wife, 
Anna, will welcome their first son in 
February. I could not be more excited 
to watch their young family grow. 
Welcome to the No Sleep Club, Lane, 
and welcome to finding a level of love 
and devotion that you did not know 
you were capable of. 
From the bottom of my heart, thank 
you for your service to the Lowcountry 
and for becoming a lifelong friend.

COMMENDING CORONAVIRUS TASK 
FORCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the achievements of the 
Coronavirus Task Force, appointed by 
President Trump and led by my broth-
er, Vice President MIKE PENCE. 
Vice President MIKE PENCE has led 
doctors, 
scientists, 
manufacturers, 
elected leaders, and others as they 
work hard to develop therapeutics and 
deliver hope for the American people. 
Under the leadership of Vice Presi-
dent PENCE and medical experts, Oper-
ation Warp Speed has been a historic 
success. We now have two vaccines 
from Pfizer and Moderna at 90 and 95 
percent effectiveness. Companies like 
Lilly have developed an effective anti-
body. 
Our scientists are making history. To 
not recognize this achievement is an 
insult to the tens of thousands of peo-
ple who have been working day and 
night to battle this pandemic. 
COVID–19 has gripped our Nation and 
our world, but under the leadership of 
President Trump and Vice President 
PENCE, and the hard work of those on 
the front lines, we are on the path to 
recovery. 
God bless those who have dedicated 
so much of their time and energy to 
helping their fellow man. 
HONORING K–9 OFFICER DIESEL 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a fallen K–9 officer in my 
hometown of Columbus, Indiana. 
Bartholomew County’s own K–9 offi-
cer Diesel died in the line of duty this 
weekend while he was in pursuit of a 
dangerous criminal. 
Diesel helped our Columbus officers 
find dangerous narcotics and search for 
suspects who had fled from the police. 
This is important work. 
Our community has come together to 
express condolences for this hero with 
flowers, notes, and even toys on the K– 
9 handler’s car at the sheriff’s office. 
Our law enforcement community is 
the thin blue line that protects our 
friends and loved ones from danger, and 
we are forever grateful to the heroes 
who sacrifice everything to ensure our 
safety. 
THANKING INDIANA’S SIXTH DISTRICT 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to express my appreciation to the Hoo-
siers of Indiana’s Sixth District. They 
have sent me to Washington again to 
represent them in Congress. It is an 
honor to be entrusted with this respon-
sibility. 
In my first term, my team and I fo-
cused on delivering quality constituent 
services, and we will continue to work 
hard for you in the next term. 
The Sixth District of Indiana is my 
home and always will be, and it is my 
honor to serve you in Congress and 
bring Hoosier values to this Nation’s 
capital. 
CONGRATULATING RYOBI DIE CASTING USA 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Ryobi Die Casting USA 
of Shelbyville, Indiana, on being named 
the General Motors Supplier of the 
Year. 
The Supplier of the Year award is 
chosen by a global team of GM pur-
chasing, engineering, quality, manu-
facturing, and logistics executives. 
Hoosier manufacturing plays a major 
role in our local economy as well as the 
global economy, and Hoosiers rely on 
the manufacturing industry for good- 
paying jobs in my district. 
Congratulations to Ryobi Die Casting 
USA for this tremendous achievement, 
and keep up the good work. 
COMMEMORATING 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
NINESTAR CONNECT 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 125th anniversary 
of NineStar Connect. 
In 1895, Loren Helms of McCordsville, 
Indiana, established the very first tele-
phone in the community and created 
the 
company 
we 
know 
today 
as 
NineStar Connect. 
With headquarters in the Sixth Dis-
trict, 
NineStar 
provides 
rural 
broadband to communities all over my 
Hoosier State. 
It is my pleasure to recognize this 
Greenfield-based company for their 
contributions 
to 
our 
community. 
Thank you to the great team at 
NineStar, and congratulations on 125 
years.

HONORING U.S. ARMY STAFF 
SERGEANT KYLE MCKEE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today with a heavy heart to honor 
the life and service of U.S. Army Staff 
Sergeant Kyle McKee. 
Staff Sergeant McKee was killed on 
November 12 in a Black Hawk heli-
copter crash during a routine peace-
keeping mission in Egypt. He was one 
of five American soldiers who lost their 
lives in that crash, all members of the 
Multinational Force and Observers, 
which oversees the peace agreement 
reached between Egypt and Israel as 
part of the Camp David Accords of 1978. 
This tragic loss of life came less than 
24 hours after our Nation observed Vet-
erans Day, and it is a somber reminder 
that the security and the freedoms we 
enjoy each and every day are not free. 
They are paid for by the service and 
sacrifice of brave men and women in 
uniform like Staff Sergeant McKee. 
Originally 
from 
Leroy 
Township, 
Staff Sergeant McKee graduated from 
Riverside High School in 2003 and fol-
lowed in both his father’s and brother’s 
footsteps when he enlisted in the Army 
that same year. 
In the 17 years that have passed 
since, he served as a crew chief in Iraq, 
Afghanistan, and Korea, receiving nu-
merous awards and decorations, includ-
ing the Global War on Terrorism Serv-
ice Medal, the National Defense Serv-
ice Medal, the Army Good Conduct 
Medal, and both the Army Commenda-
tion and Achievement Medals. 
I could go on. The list of Staff Ser-
geant McKee’s military accolades is 
not a short one. 
But he wasn’t just a patriot who 
stepped up to serve his country. He was 
also a dedicated husband to his wife, 
Nikki, and a father to not only two 
sons but his daughter, who is expected 
to be born any day now. 
As a father of three myself, I can’t 
begin to imagine the pain his family is 
feeling right now. 
I invite the entire northeast Ohio 
community to join Kelly and me in 
keeping them in our prayers and giving 
them strength and support during this 
difficult time. 
I know this entire Chamber is forever 
grateful to Staff Sergeant McKee for 
his service, so I would like to conclude 
by requesting a moment of silence to 
honor his life and pray for his loved 
ones. 
f 
1982 VOTE MACHINE RIGGING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this is my third speech in a series. 
Earlier, I cited constitutional and Fed-
eral law mandating that Congress, not 
the Supreme Court, determines wheth-
er to accept or reject State electoral 
college votes, and Congress, not the 
Supreme Court, has the final verdict on 
Presidential elections. 
My remaining speeches describe vot-
ing system failures that threaten our 
Republic. 
For emphasis, all republics depend on 
election processes that give candidates 
and citizens confidence that results ac-
curately reflect voter will. Unfortu-
nately, America’s election process has 
systemic weaknesses that too often 
allow voter fraud and election theft, 
and fail America. 
Today, I share my personal experi-
ence as a voter fraud and election theft 
target. 
In 1982, Democrats dominated Ala-
bama. All Alabama statewide elected 
officials were Democrats. The legisla-
ture had 136 Democrats to only four 
Republicans. Democrats held every sin-
gle partisan elected office in Alabama’s 
Tennessee Valley, from Mississippi on 
the west to Georgia on the east. 
In 1982, I ran as a Republican in Ala-
bama House District 18. On election 
day morning, angry voters called me 
nonstop about voting machines block-
ing them from voting for MO BROOKS. 
At first, I blew these phone calls off 
as isolated problems, naively trusting 
America’s election system. That trust 
was soon shattered. 
I am a former prosecutor. After the 
election, another attorney and I inves-
tigated. We questioned witnesses, ex-
amined documents, and inspected vot-
ing machines. 
Our investigation revealed that 11 of 
45 voting machines, 25 percent of all 
voting machines in my district, were 
rigged to block votes for MO BROOKS. In 
contrast, not a single machine blocked 
voting for my opponent or any other 
candidate on the ballot. 
At one voting precinct with five 
rigged voting machines, poll workers 
told voters that to vote for MO BROOKS, 
they had to give up their secret ballot 
right and sign a sheet on a wall for all 
to see. 
After the election, Democrat officials 
declared the voting machine problem 
was possibly caused by jostling in tran-
sit that somehow affected me, but no-
body else. 
What bunk. 
My hometown is the birthplace of 
America’s space program. We know 
math. Mathematically, if there are 26 
candidates and a machine blocks one 
candidate’s votes, the odds of that can-
didate being blocked are 1 in 26. If 
there are two machines and each block 
only one candidate, the odds of that 
candidate being blocked both times are 
1 in 26 squared, or 1 chance out of 676 
chances. 
b 1030 
Similarly, if there are 11 machines 
and each block a single candidate’s 
votes, the odds that all 11 blocked out 
MO BROOKS and no one else are a 1 
chance in 26 to the 11th power, which 
equals 1 chance out of 3.6 quadrillion 
chances. Hence, the probabilities that 
these 11 voting machines were rigged is 
an overwhelming 3.6 quadrillion to 1. 
So the question becomes: Who rigged 
the voting machines? 
In 1982, Democrats totally controlled 
Madison County voting machines. I 
was in a hotly contested race to be the 
only Republican legislator elected in 
the northern third of Alabama. I 
threatened Democrat dominance. I was 
the potential breach of the Democrat 
Party dam. 
Democrats had motive. Democrats 
had opportunity. Democrats had con-
trol. Democrats rigged the voting ma-
chines. Fortunately, despite the at-
tempted election theft, we still won 
with 57 percent of the vote. 
Mr. Speaker, every candidate and 
every American has an absolute right 
to an election system that stops voter 
fraud, prevents election theft, and ac-
curately records only lawful votes cast 
by eligible American citizens. 
As this speech and ensuing speeches 
will reveal, Alabama’s election system 
is riddled with systemic problems that 
too often render our official election 
results unreliable. Each of these elec-
tion deficiencies must be fixed and 
eliminated.

SHAREHOLDER CAPITALISM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in defense of mom-and-pop retail inves-
tors who benefit from sound corporate 
governance to promote free enterprise 
and to warn against the risks of politi-
cizing corporate leaders’ responsibil-
ities to their shareholders. 
The primary job of a corporation is 
to maximize shareholder value, not to 
engage in social engineering or politi-
cally correct causes simply to satisfy 
detractors of corporate America. Cor-
porate leaders have a fiduciary respon-
sibility to their owners which, I fear, is 
getting lost as leaders try to play the 
politics of the day. 
Last year, leaders of America’s larg-
est corporations, through the Business 
Roundtable, issued an updated ‘‘State-
ment on the Purpose of a Corporation’’ 
in which they elevated so-called stake-
holders above shareholders in their re-
sponsibilities. I take issue with this 
change because it dilutes the account-
ability leaders have to their owners

November 19, 2020 
and reflects an empty gesture intended 
only to surrender to the pressures of 
political correctness. 
In order to do right by its employees, 
customers, suppliers, and communities, 
a business must first be successful and 
profitable. A business that mistreats 
its employees or shuns its responsibil-
ities to its communities would not sur-
vive in today’s market environment. 
So why the change? This is nothing 
more than a public relations exercise 
designed to preempt any charges from 
the opponents of free enterprise who 
suggest businesses should be advancing 
specific partisan causes. 
Unfortunately, the changes resulted 
only in more ire and attention from of-
ficials it was likely intended to satisfy. 
Charges from the far left suggest that 
businesses haven’t done enough to help 
their communities. One Senator even 
used the restatement of a corporation 
to suggest that she ‘‘expects’’ business 
leaders to support her far-left cor-
porate governance bill that would take 
our free-enterprise system on a path 
toward socialism. 
The lesson here is this: If you give 
them an inch, they will take a mile. 
Recent developments suggest this re-
mains true. In September, the Business 
Roundtable called for ‘‘market-based 
solutions’’ to fight climate change and 
urged businesses to work together on 
the issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no issues with 
businesses setting public goals that 
mitigate risk and promote long-term 
growth if they are in the best interest 
of their shareholders and business 
goals, but it wasn’t enough for the 
business community’s strongest oppo-
nents. 
Earlier this month, the senior Sen-
ator from Massachusetts, ELIZABETH 
WARREN, sent a letter to the chairman 
of the Business Roundtable and the 
chair of its Energy & Environment 
Committee. The letter alleged that 
they were not doing enough and sug-
gested that they should be required to 
publicly document how companies are 
supporting emissions-reducing public 
policy. 
Instead of prioritizing their firms’ re-
sponse to the economic and health cri-
sis, keeping their employees safe dur-
ing the pandemic, and ensuring their 
customers’ needs are met, these CEOs 
of major U.S. corporations must allo-
cate time and resources to responding 
to calls from politicians on the far left 
to be more green. 
Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of the 
classic children’s book, ‘‘If You Give a 
Mouse a Cookie,’’ in which a boy gives 
a mouse a cookie and the mouse keeps 
asking for more and more and more 
and more. In this analogy, the radical 
left is the mouse, never satisfied, and 
corporate America is the young boy, 
bleeding 
resources 
to 
fulfill 
the 
mouse’s ever-expanding demands. 
By ceding shareholder primacy, the 
Nation’s business leaders began down a 
slippery slope. The radical left will not 
be placated until they remake free en-
terprise to align with their misguided, 
socialist goals. 
Mr. Speaker, the business leaders of 
this country would be well served to 
heed the admonishment of Nobel Lau-
reate Milton Friedman when he wrote: 
‘‘When I hear businessmen speak elo-
quently about the ‘social responsibil-
ities of business in a free-enterprise 
system,’ I am reminded of the wonder-
ful line about the Frenchman who dis-
covered, at the age of 70, that he had 
been speaking prose all his life. The 
businessmen believe that they are de-
fending free enterprise when they de-
claim that business is not concerned 
‘merely’ with profit but also with pro-
moting desirable ‘social’ ends; that 
business has a ‘social conscience’ and 
takes seriously its responsibilities for 
providing 
employment, 
eliminating 
discrimination, avoiding pollution and 
whatever else may be the catchwords 
of the contemporary crop of reformers. 
In fact, they are—or would be if they or 
anyone else took them seriously— 
preaching pure and unadulterated so-
cialism. Businessmen who talk this 
way are unwitting puppets of the intel-
lectual forces that have been under-
mining the basis of a free society these 
past decades.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this is a stark warning 
to those who lead America’s largest 
companies that attempts to appease so-
cialists and radical environmentalists 
are on a fool’s errand. The agenda of 
the far left is fundamentally incompat-
ible with free enterprise and a free so-
ciety. The sooner that America’s CEOs 
realize this and the sooner they return 
to a focus on shareholder value maxi-
mization, the sooner we will liberate 
the American people from the dan-
gerous and morally bankrupt ideas of 
the socialist far left. 
I will conclude, Mr. Speaker, with a 
final admonishment from Milton Fried-
man, when he said: 
‘‘There is one and only one social re-
sponsibility of business—to use its re-
sources and engage in activities de-
signed to increase its profits so long as 
it stays within the rules of the game, 
which is to say, engages in open and 
free competition without deception or 
fraud.’’ 
Profitable businesses help society. 
Profitable businesses increase employ-
ment. Profitable businesses are good 
for America.

RURAL HEALTH DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
November 19, today, as Rural Health 
Day. Each year, the third Thursday in 
November is an opportunity to high-
light both the challenges and the tri-
umphs of rural healthcare. 
Nearly 60 million Americans call 
rural America home. It is a great place 
to live, to work, and to raise a family. 
To ensure the vitality and the vibrancy 
of rural America, investments in infra-
structure, technology, and, of course, 
healthcare are critical. 
Americans in every corner of the Na-
tion deserve access to reliable, quality 
healthcare, but rural America faces its 
own unique health challenges that need 
to be addressed. Long distances to the 
nearest hospital, many uninsured and 
underinsured residents, and a growing 
elderly population, these are just a few 
obstacles that rural residents face 
when it comes to healthcare. 
This year, COVID–19 has placed an 
incredible strain on our healthcare sys-
tems, and rural hospitals have been 
particularly hit hard. 
Telehealth has emerged as a critical 
tool to better serve rural communities. 
The pandemic has underscored the 
value telehealth adds to communities 
across the Nation, particularly in rural 
America. 
This summer, I was pleased to intro-
duce the bipartisan Helping to Ensure 
Access to Local TeleHealth Act, or the 
HEALTH Act. The HEALTH Act seeks 
to extend benefits and access to this 
critical healthcare medium to more 
seniors regardless of their geographic 
location. 
As a lifetime resident of rural Penn-
sylvania and having spent nearly three 
decades as a therapist and a licensed 
nursing home administrator, I have 
been amazed how telehealth services 
make life easier for rural and under-
served communities, particularly older 
Americans. The HEALTH Act will cut 
red tape and provide community health 
centers and rural health clinics the 
ability to offer these vital health serv-
ices to their patients on a more perma-
nent basis. 
Telehealth services, however, are not 
possible without reliable access to 
high-speed, uninterrupted broadband 
connectivity with sufficient bandwidth 
to be able to handle these platforms. 
Now, I have long been an advocate of 
rural broadband. Investing in the crit-
ical infrastructure needed to deliver 
this critical resource for all Americans 
must be a top priority. 
From telehealth to telework, content 
streaming to online shopping, tele-edu-
cation, now, more than ever, we depend 
on a reliable broadband and high-speed 
internet connectivity for our everyday 
lives. During the COVID–19 pandemic, 
the digital divide affecting rural Amer-
ica has never been more apparent. 
In time, the coronavirus will be a 
thing of the past, but a national need 
for reliable broadband connectivity is 
not going anywhere. By continuing to 
encourage investments in broadband, 
we can strengthen the rural healthcare 
system and keep the people who call it 
home healthy.

GENE ARRINGTON ON HIS LIFE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5940 
November 19, 2020 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a very special con-
stituent, a legendary west Texan, and a 
great American and the most recent in-
ductee 
into 
the 
Texas 
Panhandle 
Sports Hall of Fame, Gene Arrington. 
At 6-foot-6, ‘‘Big Air,’’ as his friends 
call him, is a giant of a man with a 
larger-than-life story. 
He was raised by a single mom on the 
south side of Amarillo, Texas, with lit-
tle more than a roof over his head. In 
spite of his humble beginnings, God 
blessed him with an abundance of 
athleticism and drive that helped him 
achieve tremendous success in the 
sport of basketball. 
In 1956, Arrington led the Palo Duro 
Dons to their first State championship 
basketball title, averaging 20 points a 
game, and named to both the all-State 
and all-tournament teams. He was the 
only Texan to be invited to play in the 
North versus South All-Star Game in 
Murray, Kentucky. 
After high school, Arrington joined 
Polk Robison’s Texas Tech Red Raid-
ers, where he started for 3 years, scored 
652 points, and pulled down 409 re-
bounds in 71 games. 
His greatest feat, Mr. Speaker, while 
playing ball at Texas Tech was winning 
the heart of a young coed from Austin, 
Texas, Betty Lee Cook, who is now his 
wife of over 50 years. 
If you asked my dad about his great-
est achievements, he wouldn’t ref-
erence championship titles, all-star 
games, or all-State and all-conference 
teams. He wouldn’t mention a single 
athletic achievement or accolade. 
Instead, he would talk about the day 
he met Jesus and joined God’s kingdom 
team and what joy and blessing and 
peace and purpose he experienced from 
that relationship. 
He would talk about his most impres-
sive score of convincing my mom to 
marry him and spend over 50 years 
doing life with him and how she has 
been such a faithful friend and partner 
and such a hardworking woman and an 
amazing mother. 
He would talk about coaching three 
boys to be men and how proud he is of 
all three of us and how he prayed every 
day—every day—for our happiness in 
life and in the Lord. 
He would talk about his all-star 
friends and what a blessing they have 
been and how sweet life has been and 
how they have helped him be more suc-
cessful. 
I am proud of my dad’s induction 
into the Texas Panhandle Sports Hall 
of Fame, but, Mr. Speaker, the most 
important thing to my dad is not being 
a Hall of Fame athlete. It is being the 
best husband, father, and friend that he 
can be. 
So I congratulate my dad on his Hall 
of Fame honor. But, more importantly, 
I congratulate him on realizing his 
deepest desires and his biggest dream 
of being a world-class father and teach-
ing his boys the game of life, the love 
of God, and the true meaning of suc-
cess. 
He is our hero. God bless, and go 
West Texas.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of Heaven and Earth, we give 
You thanks for giving us another day. 
Bless the Members of the people’s 
House with focus and purpose as they 
gather these few days before Thanks-
giving. May their efforts give true 
cause for Americans to gather to give 
thanks. 
As infections continue to spread and 
hospitals nationwide are pressed to 
their limits, look with mercy upon 
Your people. May we all, together, be 
mindful of the part we can play in ad-
dressing the spread of coronavirus. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

HONORING MARIA CERDA 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, on November 8, we lost a 
trailblazer for the Latino community 
due to COVID–19. 
Maria Cerda was the first Puerto 
Rican woman and first Latina ap-
pointed to the Chicago Board of Edu-
cation. 
In that role, she secured funding for 
bilingual education programs and cul-
turally 
responsive 
curricula 
that 
helped children like me, whose first 
language was not English, succeed. 
She went on to cofound the Latino 
Institute and later served as an ap-
pointee to President Jimmy Carter’s 
National Council on Educational Re-
search. 
In the 1980s, Mayor Harold Wash-
ington appointed Maria Cerda to head 
the Office of Employment and Training 
to oversee Federal job training pro-
grams. 
The role she played in turning Chi-
cago into a sanctuary city also de-
serves recognition. 
Maria was once accosted by immigra-
tion agents in a clear case of racial 
profiling. 
The 
incident 
prompted 
Mayor Washington to issue the Na-
tion’s first ordinance preventing har-
assment of people of immigrant back-
ground. 
We celebrate her for her outstanding 
commitment to social, educational, 
and economic equity for Latinos in 
Chicago and throughout our country. 
Rest in power, Maria Cerda. We are 
eternally grateful for your work. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL RURAL 
HEALTH DAY 
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in honor of National Rural Health 
Day and to commend our healthcare 
providers across the 25th District of 
Texas for their determination during 
this once-in-a-generation public health 
crisis. 
Throughout COVID–19, these men and 
women have stepped up to continue 
serving Texans and protecting the well- 
being of our families. 
I am proud to closely partner with 
rural health facilities in our district 
like Goodall-Witcher in Clifton and 
Baylor Scott & White in Marble Falls, 
and to provide them with tangible re-
lief and resources under the CARES 
Act. 
To further support their mission, I 
introduced the Ensuring Telehealth 
Expansion Act that would help ensure 
ease of care for both physicians and 
their patients, especially during the 
pandemic. 
As our world becomes more depend-
ent on technology for healthcare deliv-
ery, it is crucial we adapt by creating 
policies that ensure the highest quality 
of care possible. 
To our central Texas doctors, nurses, 
physicians, first responders, and all 
other medical professionals, we simply 
say thank you.

RECOGNIZING TRANSGENDER DAY 
OF REMEMBRANCE 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. 
SCANLON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise to recognize Transgender 
Day of Remembrance and honor the 
memories of far too many transgender 
or gender-nonconforming people, at 
least 36 of whom were lost this year to 
fatal violence, the majority of whom 
were Black and Latinx transgender 
women. 
I want to take a moment to lift up 
the names and stories of a few of the 
Black transgender women who faced vi-
olence this year in the city of Philadel-
phia to honor their memory, because 
when we fail to acknowledge this issue, 
we cannot begin to address it. 
Dominique 
‘‘Rem’mie’’ 
Fells 
was 
murdered on July 9. A friend described 
her as a beautiful and unique soul. We 
are heartened by the fact that an ar-
rest in her murder has finally occurred. 
Tracy ‘‘Mia’’ Green was murdered on 
September 28. Her friends and family 
shared how ‘‘her smile was so perfect 
and so contagious’’ and how she always 
made people laugh. 
Kendall Stephens was brutally at-
tacked in her own home on August 24. 
As she was beaten, her attackers yelled 
transphobic slurs and said they would 
‘‘come back to finish the job.’’ Thank-
fully, Kendall survived the assault and 
dedicates her work to healing the 
transgender community in Philadel-
phia. 
This violence is motivated by anti- 
transgender bigotry, and the intersec-
tions of employment, housing, and 
other forms of discrimination put too 
many transgender people, particularly 
transgender women of color, at risk of 
violence. 
This Transgender Day of Remem-
brance, we honor those lost, honor 
their survivors. As an ally, I rededicate 
myself to working for change to pro-
tect this community from discrimina-
tion and violence. 
f 
HONORING LEE PAULL III 
(Mr. MCKINLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of my long- 
term friend, Lee Paull III, of Wheeling, 
West Virginia, who passed away earlier 
this month. 
There was nothing Lee loved more 
than his family and being from Wheel-
ing. He was an absolute pillar in the 
community, 
a 
successful 
business 
owner, an active member of the Wheel-
ing Chamber of Commerce and Rotary, 
and a passionate supporter of the 
Linsly School and Wheeling Hospital, 
as well as numerous other organiza-
tions. 
His active role in political circles 
earned him the nickname of ‘‘Mr. Re-
publican.’’ 
Lee was a proud supporter of conserv-
ative values and principles. But most 
importantly, Lee worked hard to try to 
make 
Wheeling, 
West 
Virginia, 
a 
strong and vibrant community for gen-
erations to come. 
He and his wife, June, touched the 
lives of thousands in our area. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with 
his family, their three children, and six 
grandchildren as we all mourn his pass-
ing. 
Lee, you made a difference. You will 
be missed.

REJECTION OF DEMOCRAT 
POLICIES 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, today, 
I rise to welcome my new colleagues 
who will join the 117th Congress. This 
group includes individuals from diverse 
backgrounds, including a historic num-
ber of conservative women. 
The ideals that these conservative 
Members stand for are a rejection of 
the ideals of the radical left. 
The American people have spoken 
and voted against defunding the police, 
against 
overreaching 
legislation 
to 
take election independence away from 
our States, against adding Justices to 
the Supreme Court, and against mov-
ing our country toward the failed poli-
cies of socialism. 
Instead, the American people are in-
terested in issues that will move our 
country forward, like supporting our 
veterans, securing our border, address-
ing our aging infrastructure, and en-
suring our country remains a safe place 
to live, worship, and raise a family. 
In short, the American people want 
and deserve from their leaders real so-
lutions to problems facing our Nation, 
and I will continue to work with others 
toward finding those solutions and ad-
vancing our conservative principles.

HONORING THOMAS LOWRY 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Tom Lowry of Taylorville, my friend, 
who passed away last Sunday. 
In 1971, Tom opened a Kentucky 
Fried Chicken restaurant in our home-
town and operated it until he retired in 
2015. Tom will be remembered in the 
community for his dedication to run-
ning the KFC and making everyone 
who walked through the door feel like 
family. 
For a long time, he was also on the 
board of directors at First National 
Bank. 
But I am going to remember Tom the 
most because he was my neighbor. 
After every single snowfall, since I 
lived right by him, and all of us on the 
same street, we would never have to 
wake up to an unplowed driveway be-
cause that is just what Tom did. 
I am going to miss seeing Tom with 
his dog on his golf cart rolling down 
our street, but he is also going to be 
mostly remembered for the love of his 
kids and grandkids. 
His passing is a loss for Taylorville 
and everyone who had the pleasure of 
knowing him. 
Shannon and I send our thoughts and 
prayers to his wife, Fran; his kids, 
Cheryl and Jerry; his grandkids, Joel, 
Anna, and Jillian; and his sister, Glo-
ria. 
Tom, we will miss you, man. May 
you rest in peace.

CHINA TASK FORCE 
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to commend the 
work 
of 
Republican 
Leader 
KEVIN 
MCCARTHY and Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee Ranking Member MIKE MCCAUL 
for their hard work on the China Task 
Force. 
After months of meetings and inves-
tigations, the task force released 82 
key findings and 430 associated rec-
ommendations. That number of rec-
ommendations demonstrates the im-
portant work that we have to do as a 
Congress to address China’s refusal to 
play by the rules as a global power. 
What 
was 
most 
disappointing, 
Madam Speaker, was that Speaker 
PELOSI refused to participate in this ef-
fort. 
Many of the recommendations, and 
legislation 
linked 
with 
the 
rec-
ommendations, are bipartisan. I have 
heard it directly from my Democratic 
colleagues with concerns about China’s 
actions in a variety of areas, from 
human rights, intellectual property 
theft, and military incursions in the 
South and East China Seas, just to 
name a few. 
Tackling China as an issue should be 
a bipartisan one, and I hope my Demo-
cratic colleagues will come to the table 
in the coming months to collaborate 
with Republicans on the proper strat-
egy to counter China’s decision to 
threaten the global system.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5942 
November 19, 2020 
We have some great healthcare pro-
viders, and I would like to thank them 
for their efforts, especially during the 
pandemic, to keep everyone safe and 
healthy. 
As great as it is to live in our State, 
we have a severe shortage of physi-
cians, and recruiting new ones has 
proven to be a challenge. 
The 12 community health centers and 
teaching health centers serve over 
200,000 patients alone. These medical 
facilities provide much-needed short- 
term care but also help train physi-
cians who will plant their roots, hope-
fully, in underserved areas and be 
available for their patients long term. 
Community-based programs with sta-
ble funding are sometimes the only 
way that people in rural areas can get 
the care they need. 
Let’s hope we can have a stronger 
push 
and 
use 
National 
Rural 
Healthcare Day to spotlight more of 
this issue.

GALAXY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to con-
gratulate and celebrate a local business 
in my district. The Galaxy Federal 
Credit Union in Franklin, Pennsyl-
vania, is celebrating its 80th anniver-
sary. 
The credit union was founded in 1940 
by a dozen employees of Joy Manufac-
turing. For four decades, the credit 
union operated out of the Joy Manufac-
turing Factory, serving employees by 
helping them save and establish credit. 
In 1981, the credit union opened its 
doors to other local companies in 
Venango County. In 2002, it became a 
community credit union. 
The employees of Galaxy Federal 
Credit Union pride themselves on a 
‘‘people helping people’’ approach to 
business. 
Today, Galaxy Federal Credit Union 
serves nearly 5,000 members, including 
400 youth members. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank Linda Lusher Antonucci, as well 
as the employees, members, and volun-
teers 
who 
serve 
the 
residents 
of 
Venango County through the credit 
union. 
Congratulations on 80 years.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York is recognized 
for 1 hour. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, on 
Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 1224, 
providing for consideration of H.R. 
8294, the National Apprenticeship Act 
of 2020, under a structured rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
The rule self-executes a manager’s 
amendment by Chairman SCOTT, makes 
in order 17 amendments, and provides 
en bloc authority. 
Additionally, the rule provides one 
motion to recommit and extends recess 
instructions, same day and suspension 
authority through the remainder of the 
116th Congress. 
Before I begin my formal remarks, I 
would like to take a point of personal 
privilege to thank Mr. WOODALL for his 
friendship during my time on the Rules 
Committee. We don’t always agree, but 
even in our disagreements, he is never 
disagreeable. I admire his wit, his pas-
sion, his love for this institution, and 
his love for our country. 
I wish him the very best in the future 
and hope this is not the end of his pub-
lic career. I am always delighted to 
spend time, not only in our lengthy 
Rules Committee discussions, but also 
on the floor with him, so I thank Mr. 
WOODALL so much. 
Madam Speaker, the National Ap-
prenticeship Act is critical workforce 
development legislation that will in-
vest $3.5 billion to create nearly 1 mil-
lion new apprenticeship opportunities 
over the next 5 years. 
This is an historic investment in 
workforce training, and I am so pleased 
to support this effort. Amid this chal-
lenging and catastrophic pandemic, I 
am grateful that this body is not only 
addressing the needs of the American 
people 
as 
they 
grapple 
with 
the 
COVID–19 virus, but also looking ahead 
and preparing for the challenges our 
Nation will face as we recover eco-
nomically. 
Skilled workers are the backbone of 
our economy, and apprenticeships pro-
vide a unique opportunity to grow and 
expand access to this workforce. The 
success of apprenticeship programs is

well-established. According to the De-
partment of Labor, 94 percent of ap-
prentices are employed after com-
pleting apprenticeship programs, earn-
ing an average starting wage of $70,000. 
Not only do apprenticeship programs 
provide pathways to meaningful and 
sustainable careers, they are critical to 
expanding our Nation’s skilled work-
force. 
When I meet with local business lead-
ers in my district of Rochester, New 
York, I regularly hear that their great-
est challenge is finding skilled labor to 
fill positions and keep their businesses 
thriving. Apprenticeships provide an 
invaluable pathway to engage workers, 
establish connections with high-de-
mand industries, and set workers on a 
path to a rewarding and sustainable ca-
reer. 
I am proud that a bill I introduced 
with my colleague, Congresswoman 
TRAHAN, H.R. 8317, has been included in 
the text of the National Apprenticeship 
Act. Our bill helps scale up participa-
tion among populations not typically 
engaged in apprenticeships, particu-
larly small- and medium-sized busi-
nesses. Together, we can create new op-
portunities in high-demand industries. 
This critical piece of legislation will 
bolster our Nation’s apprenticeship 
programs, build up a much-needed 
labor force, and open doors for busi-
nesses and workers alike. 
Through my position on the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, I have 
seen the months and years of biparti-
sanship that has led us to this day. 
While we don’t agree on every aspect of 
the bill, I believe the legislation before 
us is the best course of action to sup-
port 
apprenticeship 
programs 
that 
have proven the most successful for 
both working families and employers. 
Now, more than ever, these programs 
are critical to grapple with the long- 
term economic impacts of COVID–19. 
I applaud my colleague, Congress-
woman DAVIS, for her work on the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act. This com-
prehensive legislation is a testament to 
her leadership as chair of the Higher 
Education and Workforce Investment 
Subcommittee, and she will be sorely 
missed in the days and weeks and years 
ahead as she leaves us at the end of 
this term. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this rule and the underlying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend from New York, not just for his 
kind words, but for the time today. 
We always say, Madam Speaker, that 
time is yielded for the purpose of de-
bate only, and for folks who don’t fol-
low what the Rules Committee does, 
that just prevents the shenanigans that 
could occur if the gentleman from New 
York wanted to give me 30 minutes un-
limited and I could start calling meas-
ures to the floor. 
But we do need more debate, less vit-
riol and more debate. As my friend 
from New York pointed out, the ap-
prenticeship program is one of those 
programs that really does bring people 
together. 
The track record speaks for itself 
when we talk about the 90 percent em-
ployment retention rate that these ap-
prentices bring forward, when we talk 
about the $300,000 in lifetime earnings 
that apprentices generate compared to 
their nonapprentice peers. 
This really is a partnership oppor-
tunity that I am afraid the House is 
missing again today. 
Lameduck sessions, Madam Speaker, 
are strange things. Sometimes we 
bring the biggest bills that Congress is 
going to work on during lameduck ses-
sions; sometimes we bring the small-
est. Sometimes it provides that extra 
time to bring people together; and, 
candidly, on this bill, I thought that is 
what we would be doing because, ex-
actly as my friend from New York 
points out, this is a partnership issue. 
But we find ourselves here today 
with a base text that passed out of 
committee on a party-line vote. I think 
we can do better than that. I know we 
can do better than that. And to the ma-
jority’s 
credit, 
because 
this 
is 
a 
majoritarian institution, the majority 
can do absolutely anything they want 
to. 
Oftentimes, a minority substitute is 
excluded from the rule. In the wisdom 
of Rules Committee members like Mr. 
MORELLE
and 
our 
chairman, 
Mr. 
MCGOVERN, the Republican substitute 
was made in order by the Rules Com-
mittee, so we will have an opportunity 
to debate different visions of the ap-
prenticeship program. 
But I wonder, in this exceptional 
time where folks are exceptionally 
worried about the future, if maybe this 
isn’t the time to have more of those 
Republican-alternative, Democratic-al-
ternative debates and not one of those 
times that we should be speaking with 
one voice to the American people. 
There were amendments made in 
order and, candidly, more amendments 
than are traditionally made in order 
for a bill like this. Again, I can’t fault 
my Rules Committee colleagues for 
trying to get out of some of the closed 
amendment process ruts that we have 
been in, but we were so close to being 
able to make this a truly bipartisan 
process; and I am concerned, having ex-
cluded about half of the Republican 
amendments that were offered, we are 
going to fall a little bit short of that 
today. 
At its core, Madam Speaker, our dis-
agreement is about how easy should it 
be to have these apprenticeship pro-
grams certified. We absolutely have, 
through the Department of Labor, an 
official process for putting apprentice-
ships on the official U.S. Government 
list. It comes with lots of benefits and 
privileges and also comes with many 
burdens. 
As we sit here today, Madam Speak-
er, this is a process that has been in 
place for 80 years and is in need of a 
modernization in the 21st century. 
Many of the numbers we look at, 
Madam Speaker, suggest that there are 
more apprenticeships happening out-
side of the official Department of 
Labor program than inside the official 
Department of Labor program. 
One of the amendments we have 
made in order today is one from my 
friend from Washington State (Mr. KIL-
MER) that is going to make computer 
science programs, computer program-
ming programs eligible for the first 
time. 
Well, of course, anybody who has 
been in that field—I happened to be in 
one of the first computer science class-
es that America had back in the 1980s— 
knows that you learn more from your 
friends, more from your colleagues, 
more from being in the process to-
gether than you ever learned from 
reading a book or sitting in the class-
room. 
Of course, computer science ought to 
be on that list of programs, yet it has 
taken us well into 2020 to get to that 
place. I would argue we may be a dec-
ade or two late in that process, but bet-
ter late than never. 
As my friend from New York ref-
erenced, I am on my way out of the in-
stitution; and, candidly, I am pleased 
that we have a process that, even 
though the result is a partisan result, 
has more bipartisanship in it than 
many of the bills that I have had to 
represent here in the Rules Committee 
minority position that I hold. 
It is my great hope that, as this in-
stitution shrinks the distance between 
the majority and minority heading 
into 2021, it is going to provide oppor-
tunities to remind us how much we 
need each other to get things done. 
The best votes I took as a young 
freshman Member, Madam Speaker, 
were not the ones that John Boehner 
jammed through with all of the Repub-
licans voting ‘‘yes’’ and all of the 
Democrats voting ‘‘no.’’ 
b 1230 
The best votes that I took freshman 
year were the ones that John Boehner 
jammed through with NANCY PELOSI’s 
help that had about 50 percent of the 
Democrats and about 50 percent of the 
Republicans and did the big things that 
you just couldn’t do alone, Madam 
Speaker, that required Members to 
stand up and get outside of their ideo-
logical comfort zone and get into that 
space of how can we really make a dif-
ference. 
Is this bill going to make a difference 
for American workers and young peo-
ple trying to get started in their career 
and businesses trying to recruit good 
talent? 
Of course, it is. Of course, it is. It is 
a modest step in the right direction, 
but it is a step in the right direction. 
I am going to encourage my col-
leagues to defeat the rule so that we 
can take a larger step in the right di-
rection. Sometimes, Madam Speaker,

November 19, 2020 
you have to play small ball to get the 
gears of success turning at the appro-
priate speed. Sometimes you are up 
against crises like COVID–19 where you 
don’t have time for small ball, and you 
have got to take those big steps. 
I will mention just one to you, 
Madam Speaker. I offered an amend-
ment in the Rules Committee to make 
in order an amendment by my friend 
from Pennsylvania, whom you saw on 
the floor here earlier, Mr. THOMPSON. 
His amendment simply said this: Dur-
ing the COVID–19 crisis, while we are 
seeing the economy evolve in ways 
that we could have never predicted and 
still cannot predict, let us give the Sec-
retary of the Department of Labor the 
ability to be nimble in terms of desig-
nating new apprenticeship programs. 
Now, for the next 40 days, that De-
partment of Labor Secretary is going 
to be a Trump appointee. After those 40 
days, we are going to have a different 
scenario happening there. 
Is this an issue of our being in the rut 
of voting ‘‘no’’ on the administration 
that is not of our political persuasion? 
Is this an example of our starting to 
reclaim some Article I power and to 
stop delegating things down to 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue and instead re-
taining those authorities here? 
We didn’t get to have that debate be-
cause we didn’t make that amendment 
in order, and we are not going to be 
able to have that conversation. It is a 
conversation that needs to be had. We 
need to get out of our habits of voting 
‘‘no’’ on the other team that sits in the 
White House, and we need to get into 
the habit of being so nimble ourselves 
that we don’t have to delegate author-
ity to the executive in order to get 
things done, that we are able to get 
those things done. 
It is difficult for me, Madam Speak-
er, to be this close to the kind of legis-
lative process that I came here to be a 
part of and our not reaching that goal. 
I do want to recognize success where 
success lives, and we had a more suc-
cessful Rules Committee process this 
time than many times in the past, but 
it only reminds us of how close we are 
to that process that I believe all of our 
constituents expect of us, and that is 
bring all the ideas into the room, vote 
‘‘no’’ on the bad ideas, vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
the good ideas, bring all 435 of our col-
lective experiences to the floor, and 
let’s put the best of it into the 
lawbooks to serve those whom we are 
sworn to serve. 
If my colleagues are willing to work 
with me to defeat the previous ques-
tion today, I think we are going to 
have a chance to move in that direc-
tion. I look forward to talking with my 
friend from New York and the rest of 
my colleagues about that more to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
There are just a couple of points that 
I would make. First of all, with regard 
to amendments, I do note that there 
were substantial amendments made in 
order that were offered by Republicans. 
I do know that some amendments of-
fered by Republicans where withdrawn 
because they are essentially part of the 
large amendment in the substitute bill 
which will be on the floor. So there will 
be, I think to Mr. WOODALL’s point— 
and I appreciate his sentiments here— 
I think there will be an opportunity, 
given the way we structured this rule 
and given the latitude that I think the 
majority gave, in making certain that 
there will be an adequate opportunity 
for a real debate about some of the dis-
tinctions between the minority’s and 
the majority’s perspective on this par-
ticular bill. 
So I actually think this was an op-
portunity and will be an opportunity 
for Chairman SCOTT and Mrs. DAVIS 
who is the chair of the subcommittee 
and I suspect will be debating the bill 
and amendments in just short order. So 
I think there will be that fullness and 
that richness of debate that my good 
friend from Georgia has talked about. 
I do want to just make a point, 
though, about the process over the last 
several years plus. I think in the last 
year and a half there were four dif-
ferent hearings held by the Higher Edu-
cation and Workforce Investment Sub-
committee which Mrs. DAVIS
heads, 
there were months of intensive nego-
tiations. There was a bipartisan Mem-
ber-level roundtable, there were at 
least four hearings on the subject, and 
there was a real effort and I believe 
even an opportunity for us to reach bi-
partisan compromise to expand access 
to these high quality apprenticeship 
programs. 
Unfortunately, I think, at what I 
would describe as nearly the eleventh 
hour, the White House made clear it 
would not support the bill unless the 
Department of Labor and the White 
House were granted a much broader op-
portunity to approve apprenticeship 
programs in ways that we don’t believe 
safeguard the interests of businesses or 
the people who would apply for those 
apprentice programs. 
It brings to mind an experience I 
had—I think I have shared it on this 
floor, and certainly with Mr. WOODALL 
in Rules Committee meetings—my ex-
perience previous to this in the State 
legislature. One of my responsibilities 
during my career there was to chair 
the committee on insurance, and I 
often would find myself in the posi-
tion—even though I had a friendly 
Democratic administration—where the 
legislation would have, sort of at the 
end of it, sort of a blanket ability for 
at the time the superintendent of in-
surance to do whatever he or she felt 
was appropriate and give wide latitude. 
I would always strike that from the 
bills before passage saying that I 
thought it was the responsibility of the 
legislature to set policy to enact legis-
lation. 
So what I believe we ought to be 
doing here—and I think Mr. WOODALL 
would generally agree with me—rel-
ative to our Article I responsibilities of 
legislation being passed by both Houses 
of the Congress that giving, in my 
view, too wide a latitude to the Depart-
ment of Labor, whether it is in the cur-
rent outgoing administration or the in-
coming, makes little sense, that it is 
the rule and the responsibility and the 
duty of the Congress to make sure that 
those standards are set in law, in stat-
ute, not in rule, not in regulation, and 
not at the whim of the Department of 
Labor or any other agency of the gov-
ernment. 
So I think what we seek to do is not 
only to promote and expand appren-
ticeship opportunities, because—for all 
the reasons my distinguished colleague 
from Georgia and friend mentioned, the 
ability for apprentices to make more 
during their career, the quality of 
those programs—we believe standards 
need to be continued, that they need to 
be strengthened, that we can expand 
these programs into the kinds of indus-
tries that heretofore have not really 
availed themselves of apprenticeship 
opportunities, that we can do that, 
meet all of those goals, still set those 
standards and make sure that they are 
delineated in statute. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate his 
comments, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, there are a lot of 
issues out there, certainly student 
loans and educating young people for 
21st century skills is one of those, and 
I am glad we are taking this time out 
today to focus on that before the end of 
this Congress. 
There are other issues out there, 
though, that we all know in a bipar-
tisan way need attention, whether it is 
COVID testing, vaccines, and thera-
peutics, that are in the newspaper 
every day but on which Congress has 
not acted recently, we know that needs 
attention; whether it is the Paycheck 
Protection Program, those programs 
that were supporting employers and 
employees that have expired that in a 
bipartisan way we know need attention 
but the Congress has not acted on that; 
whether it is on police reform, again, 
in the paper and in the media every 
day and we know in a bipartisan way 
we can do better to serve our citizenry, 
and yet we have not acted on that. 
If we defeat the previous question 
today, Madam Speaker, it will not slow 
down the apprenticeship conversation 
that we are having. What it will do is 
make sure that in the limited time we 
have remaining in this Congress that 
we do tackle those three issues that I 
mentioned: COVID, vaccines, thera-
peutics, and testing; police reform, 
ways that we can act together in a bi-
partisan way to serve the country; and 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program, 
helping employers and employees to 
survive into 2021 as we all know they 
need to do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5945 
November 19, 2020 
I ask unanimous consent, Madam 
Speaker, to include the text of my 
amendment 
in 
the 
CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD immediately prior to the vote 
on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
led talking about therapeutics as it re-
lates to COVID. I am very fortunate on 
the 
Rules 
Committee, 
as 
is 
Mr. 
MORELLE, to be able to serve with a 
gentleman who spent his lifetime in 
the service of others through medicine, 
Dr. BURGESS. 
Dr. BURGESS also sits on the Energy 
and Commerce Committee which has 
had jurisdiction over this issue, and 
which has had numerous bipartisan 
bills and opportunities to move for-
ward. Defeating the previous question 
today would make in order the gen-
tleman from Texas’ bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS) to talk about the real impact 
that could have on the American citi-
zenry. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
truly it has been a privilege to serve 
with the gentleman from Georgia on 
the Rules Committee. I have learned a 
lot from occupying that seat beside 
him there. 
Madam Speaker, there is still a pan-
demic raging through our country. 
Every community in this country has 
been affected, and community spread is 
unfortunately going in the wrong di-
rection as the virus rages across our 
land. My home State of Texas has had 
over 1 million cases of this novel 
coronavirus. We have been awaiting re-
lief packages for months and passing 
partisan packages does not help when 
our Nation needs us most. 
Where has the sense of urgency been 
from House Democratic leadership? 
In February I called for hearings on 
the coronavirus at the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, and my re-
quests were dismissed. Congress has 
since provided support in the form of 
funding for vaccines, testing, and more, 
but we should continue to support our 
Nation’s pandemic response in these 
ways, especially as cases are now rag-
ing across the country. 
We could come together to provide 
our country with the resources to fight 
this invisible enemy. House Demo-
cratic leadership does not seem to be 
up to this task. 
My legislation, H.R. 8086, provides 
funding for the Public Health and So-
cial Services Emergency Fund to de-
velop 
additional 
medical 
counter-
measures and vaccines. In fact, in the 
past 2 weeks we have received incred-
ibly encouraging news that early data 
shows two of the coronavirus vaccine 
candidates to be more than 90 percent 
effective. A safe and effective vaccine 
is the strongest arrow we could have in 
our quiver to allow our people to re-
turn to normal. We also have new anti-
body treatments that could be used in 
nonhospitalized 
mild 
to 
moderate 
coronavirus patients. 
At this point I would give credit to 
the administration that recognized the 
need 
for 
these 
medical 
counter-
measures, antivirals, antibodies, and 
vaccines and really put the entire 
strength of the whole of government 
response into Operation Warp Speed. 
The public sector and private sector 
are now delivering on that promise, 
and we are likely just days away from 
the Food and Drug Administration pro-
viding emergency use authorization for 
one or both of these new vaccines— 
again, vaccines that are over 90 percent 
effective—when we didn’t even have 
the genetic sequence of this virus until 
the end of January. That is a phe-
nomenal accomplishment. 
But now is not the time to take our 
foot off the gas. The House continues 
to waste its time on partisan bills that 
are going to be dead on arrival in the 
Senate instead of delivering results for 
Americans. There are commonsense, 
bipartisan ways to help our Nation re-
spond to the coronavirus, including my 
bill 
to 
increase 
funding 
for 
the 
coronavirus response, Mr. CHABOT’s bill 
to improve the Paycheck Protection 
Program, and Mr. STAUBER’s bill to 
fund better training for law enforce-
ment. 
But 
House 
Democrats 
have 
turned their backs on the needs of 
America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
vote against the previous question so 
we may take up these important meas-
ures. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I do want to note 
that we are here to discuss the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act, and that is 
the subject of the discussion in front of 
the House. 
But I would note, parenthetically, 
however, the irony in the subject that 
was brought up by my dear friend from 
Texas. The President of the United 
States has not met with his own 
coronavirus task force in 6 months and 
has barely spoken in the last 2 weeks 
while this Nation is engulfed with the 
virus’ spread throughout the Midwest. 
We have now surpassed 250,000 Ameri-
cans dead of the coronavirus. One-quar-
ter of one million Americans have lost 
their lives, and yet there is no discus-
sion out of the White House. 
I would encourage perhaps my col-
leagues to ask the President if he 
might meet with Dr. Fauci and the 
leaders in this country who are on the 
front lines of fighting this illness. 
I do also note, also parenthetically, 
that 7 months ago this House passed 
the $3.4 trillion Heroes Act to address 
contact tracing, testing, and support 
for our frontline workers, hospital sys-
tems, and State and local governments. 
We had no action from the United 
States Senate. 
b 1245 
We came back and, about 6 weeks 
ago, took up the updated Heroes Act— 
$2.2 trillion—again, to try to address 
the suffering of millions of Americans. 
Yet, no action from the United States 
Senate. So I think we have more than 
stepped up to address the concerns of 
the American people as it relates to 
the issue not before the House right 
now. 
I do understand that the good people 
of Georgia, my dear friend, will go 
home in a few weeks, and the great 
folks in the State of Georgia will per-
haps have something to say about the 
direction of the United States Senate 
going forward. But I do note that I 
think this House’s record has been ex-
emplary in addressing this. I now get 
back to the issue at hand. 
Madam Speaker, for the purpose of 
further discussion, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
DANNY K. DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the rule and in strong support 
of the act. As I listened to the discus-
sion relative to the coronavirus, the 
pandemic, I am very optimistic now 
with the advent and the announcement 
of vaccines that may very well prove to 
be effective. It means that as we gain 
control of the pandemic, as we gain 
control of the virus, we are going to 
need a well-trained, skilled workforce 
ready and available to work if we are 
going to rebuild and redevelop our eco-
nomic status. Having this workforce 
available, 
increasing 
apprenticeship 
training and opportunities is one of the 
best possible things that we could do. 
Madam Speaker, I commend Rep-
resentative SCOTT and the Committee 
on Education and Labor for their work 
on this bill. I urge strong support for it 
and I will vote to pass it, and I can 
hardly wait to do so. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I have worked with 
the gentleman from New York long 
enough to know that it is true that we 
sometimes measure our success by 
what the House does. But working with 
the gentleman from New York, I have 
seen him measure his success by what 
he actually gets done for folks. You 
never see him trying to take credit for 
getting the work done. He is just doing 
the work. And too often, I think, all of 
us have come to talk about what it was 
that we passed in a partisan way and 
how that absolves us of any more re-
sponsibility. 
It is true, the House jammed through 
a partisan COVID package 7 months 
ago, and absolutely nothing has hap-
pened to it since then. That is what 
happens when you jam through par-
tisan packages. If we jam through a 
partisan apprenticeship package, that 
is also what is going to happen to a 
partisan apprenticeship package.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5946 
November 19, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the rank-
ing member of the Committee on Small 
Business, who crafted the last bipar-
tisan package. And when that bipar-
tisan package was crafted, it didn’t 
just pass this House, it didn’t just pass 
the Senate, it was signed into law by 
the President of the United States. And 
it made the difference in the life of our 
constituents that my friend from New 
York and I would like to make. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question today, we will have the 
chance to, again, go to that bipartisan 
well of support that my friend from 
Ohio has generated. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), 
the ranking member of the Committee 
on Small Business. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, the 
gentleman from New York suggested 
that we, on this side of the aisle, 
should talk to the President of the 
United States about what he has or 
hasn’t done. 
Well, he is all the way down on Penn-
sylvania Avenue. I would suggest the 
gentleman from New York might want 
to talk to a lady, probably in this very 
building right now, and that is the 
Speaker, who can bring up a second 
round of PPP loans. We have got the 
votes. 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
both 
agree we ought to do this, but she 
wouldn’t bring it up for a vote. So we 
tried to go through the discharge peti-
tion process. And no Democrat in this 
House would sign it and let us have a 
vote. So we are trying again, because a 
lot of small businesses really need this. 
Madam Speaker, an important holi-
day is coming up. Next Saturday is 
Small Business Saturday. It is the day 
when we take time to support the res-
taurants and shops and other small 
businesses that create two out of every 
three new jobs in America. Normally, 
this is an occasion to eat a delicious 
meal, get a head start on Christmas 
shopping, and say hello to friends and 
neighbors. Unfortunately, this year, an 
awful lot of those small businesses are 
struggling due to COVID–19. 
A recent NFIB survey indicated that 
over half of small businessowners ex-
pect to seek additional financial assist-
ance over the next year. If they can’t 
access that help, they may be forced to 
lay off employees again or cease oper-
ations. That is just unacceptable, be-
cause we can help them. 
We have a program that has already 
supported over 50 million jobs all 
across this country. It even has over 
$130 billion ready to go. We already 
have the money. We don’t have to ap-
propriate additional dollars at all. The 
money is there. That program, the 
PPP, or Paycheck Protection Program, 
stopped accepting applications back in 
August. 
Instead of quickly passing a bill to 
reopen the program, the Democratic 
leadership in this House used it as a po-
litical football for over 3 months while 
small businessowners had to drain the 
last of their funds to stay in existence 
and to continue to pay their employ-
ees, and they nervously continued to 
worry about how they are going to 
make payroll. 
Madam Speaker, today, we have a 
chance to do the right thing and do 
right by these small businesses. They 
are, after all, the heartbeat of each and 
every one of our communities. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, which is before us now, 
we can move directly to the legislative 
package that includes the bill that I 
just mentioned, my bill, the PPP, 
again, to reopen and improve the Pay-
check Protection Program. 
Madam Speaker, let’s defeat this pre-
vious question and send aid to those 
small businesses all across the country 
who desperately need it. I can think of 
no better way to celebrate Small Busi-
ness Saturday. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
WOODALL. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
again, thinking about things that the 
American people are looking for and 
the opportunities we have to craft 
those in a bipartisan way, Mr. STAUBER 
brings his lifetime of law enforcement 
experience to this Chamber, giving us 
an opportunity to do those things that 
we all know need to be done. 
How can we serve our constituency 
better? 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
STAUBER) to share not just his partner-
ship effort in trying to work across the 
aisle to get that done, but also his vast 
experience in that area. 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I am 
worried that, once again, we are not 
rising to the occasion as the American 
people continue to suffer from both 
this health crisis and the subsequent 
economic disaster. As the American 
people continue to call for justice for 
their fellow Americans, we are back 
here in D.C., for the first time in 7 
weeks, and not one item on the Speak-
er’s docket is to answer the American’s 
people call or provide them relief. I am 
disappointed because I know that we 
can do better. 
Madam Speaker, 2020 has been a 
tough year, but we have seen some 
wonderful moments of bipartisanship. 
In the early months of this pandemic, 
Republicans and Democrats came to-
gether to pass the CARES Act, which 
created lifesaving programs for small 
businesses and helped provide families 
financial relief. 
Additionally, in response to calls for 
nationwide justice reform, I introduced 
the bipartisan JUSTICE Act, legisla-
tion cosponsored by both Republicans 
and Democrats that will improve our 
policing and reestablish trust between 
our law enforcement officers and the 
communities they serve. 
Unfortunately, despite the JUSTICE 
Act’s 
bipartisan 
nature, 
Democrat 
leadership does not want to address 
this issue. Despite the CARES Act’s bi-
partisan nature, Democrat leadership 
continues to walk away from relief 
package discussions. Partisanship has 
once again taken priority over the 
needs of the American people. 
Madam Speaker, if the previous ques-
tion is defeated, we will take up legis-
lation that I introduced that will pro-
vide $850 million for better training of 
police officers; $500 million to increase 
the number of body cameras; and $1.2 
billion in grants to police departments 
to invest in community policing, which 
is the philosophy that you don’t police 
your community, you police with your 
community. 
Madam Speaker, I said this on the 
House floor in August, and it is unfor-
tunate that I am saying this here once 
again in November: It is time for this 
Congress to get back to work. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to note 
that I feel a little bit like Alice in 
‘‘Alice through the Looking Glass,’’ 
where in is out and up is down. I just 
reiterate that this House has addressed 
in a significant way reform for polic-
ing. We have, indeed, in this House, ad-
dressed on two separate occasions the 
impact of COVID on healthcare work-
ers and State and local governments 
and the millions of Americans who 
struggle to put food on the table and 
face unemployment. 
So all of the things that my friends 
on the other side of the aisle have just 
discussed are things that this House 
has done. And it is really the recal-
citrance of the United States Senate 
and their unwillingness not only to not 
adopt our measures, but adopt their 
own that would allow us to then settle 
into a conversation or discussion about 
the differences that separate us and to 
try to reach that bipartisan/bicameral 
compromise that I know Mr. WOODALL 
very much believes in. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to make 
one other point, if I might, which is the 
Apprenticeship Act that we have before 
us, if you had dropped in from some-
where and saw on our program that we 
were discussing the National Appren-
ticeship Program and listened to my 
friends on the other side of the aisle, 
you would be confused why they 
weren’t on the subject. But I do want 
to get to the subject, which is that this 
is, in part, a response—not certainly 
totally a response to, because we were 
working on this for some time before 
COVID, but this has, at its heart, a re-
sponse to the economic fallout of the 
virus and is entirely on point because 
the economic impacts will be felt for 
years. 
Some economists are saying this 
country will feel the impacts of COVID 
for another 3 or 4 years. The appren-
ticeship programs and the reason we 
are here having this conversation is to 
be able to expand them dramatically 
and give people who are either in tran-
sition from other careers or getting 
into careers will give them the oppor-
tunity to earn not only a living wage,

November 19, 2020 
but to advance, get career opportuni-
ties on a career ladder, particularly to 
those industries that have really not 
been involved in the apprenticeship 
program in the past. 
Madam Speaker, again, I reiterate 
what we are doing here, the importance 
of what we are doing, how critical this 
is. Obviously, we always want to seek a 
bipartisan compromise, because, as my 
dear friend from Georgia rightly points 
out, it is not about what we pass in 
this House, it is what we pass in the 
Congress and send to the other end of 
Pennsylvania Avenue, hopefully, for 
signature. 
So it is very much the conversation 
here, and I hope that not only my col-
leagues here, but our friends across the 
floor and in the Senate will take up 
this much-needed legislation before we 
are done, in a lameduck session, the 
session in front of us, and that the 
President can be persuaded to act on it. 
That is the work before us and it is 
critical and important work, indeed. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, when you reach the 
end of your service in Congress, you 
start thinking about those things that 
you are really, really proud of, and you 
start thinking about those things that 
you wish had gone differently. 
I have only gotten to override one of 
President Trump’s vetoes since I have 
been here in Congress. And I will tell 
you—and I will tell President Trump— 
I thoroughly enjoyed that, thoroughly 
enjoyed it, because I didn’t come here 
as a Republican, I came here as a 
United States House Member. And any 
time the Article 1 branch comes to-
gether and speaks so loudly and proud-
ly in a single voice that it can even 
swamp the voice of the most powerful 
leader of the free world, the President 
of the United States, that tells me 
something about how our Republic is 
functioning. And I am excited about 
that. I don’t think I am going to have 
a chance to do that in our next 3 weeks 
here, but I appreciated the opportunity 
to do it the one time I did. 
Madam Speaker, we have to get back 
into that habit of speaking with one 
voice. We are stronger not just as an 
institution when we speak with one 
voice, we are stronger as a nation when 
we speak with one voice. This appren-
ticeship bill should have been one of 
those things. 
b 1300 
Instead of having me on the House 
floor saying, ‘‘We are taking a small 
step in the right direction, and that is 
great, but why didn’t we go big?’’ it 
would have been nice if the chairman 
and the ranking member could have ne-
gotiated that middle ground first and I 
could have been down here talking 
about how it didn’t go as far as I want-
ed it to go, but we did the best we 
could with what we had to work with, 
and so let’s all vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
We can do that, and we have had 
some experience doing that. Our initial 
response to COVID was exactly that. 
Candidly, this is as close as we have 
come in quite some time. I know that 
the ranking member, VIRGINIA FOXX 
from North Carolina, wanted to get 
over the finish line there. 
We 
have 
made 
two 
Republican 
amendments in order in this rule, 
Madam Speaker, and we have made two 
bipartisan amendments in order, and 
we have made 13 Democratic amend-
ments in order, all on a bill that passed 
on a party-line vote out of committee. 
Sometimes the process works that 
way. Sometimes the House needs to 
put down a marker. But late November 
of an election year is not the time for 
putting down markers. It is the time 
for putting points up on the scoreboard 
for the American people, and this bill 
fails in that regard. 
If we defeat this rule, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in voting ‘‘no’’ on 
it, I know—I don’t think, Madam 
Speaker, I know—that the chairman 
and the ranking member can come 
back together and we can bring that 
partnership bill to the floor that I am 
talking about. 
My friend from New York talks about 
expanding the apprenticeship program. 
That is the crux of the problem: He ex-
pands it a little; we want to expand it 
a lot, because we all recognize what the 
needs of the American worker and the 
American economy are. Defeat this 
rule, and we will have that chance. 
Defeat the previous question, Madam 
Speaker, and we are going to have a 
chance to talk about these three bills. 
My friend from New York is absolutely 
right; they are extraneous to what we 
are talking about today. But the three 
gentlemen who spoke spoke truth when 
they said we have been trying to bring 
these up through the regular process 
and we can’t. 
We know a vote to extend and reform 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
would pass this House with a huge bi-
partisan majority today, but the House 
leadership has not given us an oppor-
tunity to have that vote. 
We know that an investment in com-
munity policing, a goal championed by 
Republicans and Democrats for dec-
ades, could pass this floor in a bipar-
tisan basis, but the House leadership 
hasn’t given us that opportunity. 
We know, as every single one of our 
constituents is concerned about their 
health and their business and their 
children, that if we passed a COVID 
therapeutics program, a testing pro-
gram, a program targeting vaccines, 
getting the rest of that job done, we 
know it would pass in a bipartisan way, 
but we have not had a chance to bring 
up such bipartisan legislation. 
I have served in this institution when 
the House and the White House were 
held by one party and the Senate was 
held by another party. What I found 
during that time is that the negotia-
tion happened between 1600 Pennsyl-
vania Avenue and Constitution Ave-
nue, and those of us on Independence 
Avenue were largely left out of that 
conversation. 
For my colleagues who remain, I 
worry about that for you, because I be-
lieve that we operate differently than 
the Senate, and for good reason. I don’t 
want to change the majoritarian na-
ture of our institution. I am glad that 
it is passionate and it is deep and it is 
messy and sometimes the fights spill 
out of the committee room and onto 
the House floor. I value that. I value 
the Senate’s go-slow approach and the 
larger voice given to the minority 
there. 
We don’t often get opportunities to 
fix our bad habits. While Paul Ryan 
was Speaker of the House, we had not 
one open rule, not one chance in his en-
tire Speakership for the House to come 
together and have everyone have a 
chance to contribute and have their 
voice heard—not once. And during 
Speaker PELOSI’s second Speakership, 
we have had not one opportunity ei-
ther. 
For years now, this House has gotten 
in the habit of deciding that every 
voice is not worthy of hearing. Cer-
tainly, there are bills and there are 
measures where that needs to be true. 
A partnership issue like the appren-
ticeship program, a partnership issue 
like serving our young people, a part-
nership issue like jump-starting our 
economy, this is one of those opportu-
nities where the bad ideas would be re-
jected in a bipartisan way and the good 
ideas would be adopted in a bipartisan 
way and we would speak to America in 
a single voice, bipartisan way about 
the pathway that we have crafted to go 
forward. 
Madam Speaker, if you would sur-
render 
your 
gavel 
and 
allow 
Mr. 
MORELLE and me to sort out all of the 
issues I have mentioned today, I think 
by the end of November, certainly the 
first week of December, we could crack 
all of those nuts. For whatever reason, 
our Framers did not believe that it 
should be given to two bipartisan folks 
who want to solve problems. They be-
lieve that all 435 voices should be 
heard. 
It is hard. I worry when we miss 
chances like the one we had today to 
demonstrate to the American people 
what we know to be true about the way 
that we work together. When we miss 
an opportunity to demonstrate that to 
folks from the floor of this House, we 
do some bit of damage to the fabric of 
our Republic. That damage happens 
under Republican leadership and that 
damage 
happens 
under 
Democratic 
leadership, and I fear one day that 
damage will be so great that neither 
party is going to be able to turn it 
back. 
I do want to urge defeat of this rule 
today, and I want to urge defeat of the 
previous question. But I want to recog-
nize Members like Mr. MORELLE from

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5948 
November 19, 2020 
New York and Members like our chair-
man, Mr. MCGOVERN from Massachu-
setts, who have made sincere and dif-
ficult efforts to move us in that part-
nership direction. 
Defeat this rule. Defeat the previous 
question. Let’s give them a chance to 
move us even further in that bipartisan 
direction going forward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Just to take a moment to wax philo-
sophical on bipartisanship, I think I 
agree with almost everything my dis-
tinguished friend had to say. 
If you are frustrated, Mr. WOODALL, 
imagine our frustration that, for the 
last 7 months, we have continued to try 
to engage in conversations with the 
other House, only to be met with si-
lence. 
We hear, as you do, when you go 
home, from thousands of constituents 
in each district, millions of Americans 
who struggle because they have lost 
their job, because they have lost their 
restaurant, as a small business owner 
that they struggle. We have heard from 
healthcare workers who continue to 
struggle to have personal protective 
equipment. We have talked to people 
who desperately need stimulus checks 
or some other support to put food on 
the table. 
So we hear all of that, and I wish 
that the conversation that could hap-
pen between both sides of the aisle here 
in this Chamber would answer those 
questions. They can’t, because we do 
need to have support and engagement 
and a dialogue with our friends in the 
other House. So I understand and feel 
your frustration. 
Our frustration is even greater. I 
would love that we could work out the 
issues here in this Chamber, you and I 
and the members of the Rules Com-
mittee and all of the Members of the 
House, and have that be a settled ques-
tion. I think we would be in a better 
place 
Having said that, Madam Speaker, 
let me just, again, note, this is perhaps 
the last time I will have the great op-
portunity to serve on this floor and 
have a discussion on a rule with my 
distinguished 
friend 
from 
Georgia. 
Again, I want to just indicate how 
much I appreciate him and how much 
admiration and affection I have for 
him and wish him all the best. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank all 
of the colleagues who have spoken in 
the various committees for their words 
in support of H.R. 8294, the National 
Apprenticeship Act. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1224 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 8086) to provide additional appropria-
tions for the public health and social serv-
ices emergency fund, and for other purposes. 
The first reading of the bill shall be dis-
pensed with. All points of order against con-
sideration of the bill are waived. Clause 2(e) 
of rule XXI shall not apply during consider-
ation of the bill. General debate shall be con-
fined to the bill and shall not exceed one

points of order against provisions in the bill 
are waived. When the committee rises and 
reports the bill back to the House with a rec-
ommendation that the bill do pass, the pre-
vious question shall be considered as ordered 
on the bill and amendments thereto to final 
passage without intervening motion except 
one motion to recommit with or without in-
structions. If the Committee of the Whole 
rises and reports that it has come to no reso-
lution on the bill, then on the next legisla-
tive day the House shall, immediately after

SEC. 7. Imediately after disposition of H.R.

the CARES Act to establish a program for 
second draw loans and make other modifica-

and for other purposes. The first reading of 
the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are

ly divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Committee

against provisions in the bill are waived. 
When the committee rises and reports the

tion that the bill do pass, the previous ques-
tion shall be considered as ordered on the 
bill and amendments thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except one mo-
tion to recommit with or without instruc-
tions. If the Committee of the Whole rises 
and reports that it has come to no resolution 
on the bill, then on the next legislative day 
the House shall, immediately after the third 
daily order of business under clause 1 of rule 
XIV, resolve into the Committee of the 
Whole for further consideration of the bill. 
SEC. 8. Immediately after disposition of 
H.R. 8265, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 8088) to provide funding to law enforce-
ment agencies, and for other purposes. The 
first reading of the bill shall be dispensed 
with. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. General debate 
shall be confined to the bill and shall not ex-
ceed one hour equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on the Judiciary. After 
general debate the bill shall be considered 
for amendment under the five-minute rule. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
bill are waived. When the committee rises 
and reports the bill back to the House with 
a recommendation that the bill do pass, the 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and amendments thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept one motion to recommit with or with-
out instructions. If the Committee of the 
Whole rises and reports that it has come to 
no resolution on the bill, then on the next 
legislative day the House shall, immediately 
after the third daily order of business under 
clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Com-
mittee of the Whole for further consideration 
of the bill. 
SEC. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 8086, H.R. 
8265, and H.R. 8088. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
HOULAHAN). The question is on ordering 
the previous question. 
The question was taken; and the

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 8294, 
the National Apprenticeship Act of 
2020. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 8294, the National Apprentice-
ship Act of 2020. 
Our economy continues to perma-
nently lose jobs due to the COVID–19 
pandemic. In fact, it is estimated that 
7 million of those who lose jobs during 
the pandemic will not return to those 
jobs. 
Congress has a responsibility to help 
workers not only find jobs, but also 
prepare them for long-term employ-
ment. Expanding the registered appren-
ticeship system, our most successful 
workforce development initiative, is 
the proven solution we need. 
Each year, hundreds of thousands of 
workers count on registered appren-
ticeships to learn in-demand skills, 
earn wages that grow along with those 
skills, and receive nationally recog-
nized credentials that lead to reward-
ing careers. Registered apprenticeships 
are also so successful that 94 percent of 
apprentices are employed upon comple-
tion and earn an average starting wage 
of more than $70,000 a year. 
Despite the growing demand for ap-
prenticeship 
opportunities, 
Congress 
has not reauthorized the National Ap-
prenticeship Act since it was first 
passed in 1937. 
The legislation before us will invest 
$3.5 billion in our apprenticeship sys-
tem; ensures consistency and quality 
across programs; increases opportuni-
ties for diverse groups of workers who 
have not traditionally been included; 
and expands registered apprenticeships 
in 
emerging 
sectors, 
such 
as 
healthcare, finance, and technology. 
This investment alone would create 
approximately 1 million apprentice-
ships, pre-apprenticeships, and youth 
apprenticeships, and it would yield 
roughly $10.6 billion in benefits to tax-
payers through higher tax revenues 
and decreased spending on social safety 
net programs. 
Construction trades and their indus-
try partners have long proven that the 
registered apprenticeship model works. 
It is long past time that we expand reg-
istered apprenticeship opportunities to 
benefit workers across other industries 
and across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, November 5, 2020. 
Hon. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT, 
Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT: This is to advise 
you that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has now had an opportunity to review the 
provisions in H.R. 8294, the National Appren-
ticeship Act of 2020, that fall within our Rule 
X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting 
with us on those provisions. The Judiciary 
Committee has no objection to your includ-
ing them in the bill for consideration on the 
House floor, and to expedite that consider-
ation is willing to waive sequential referral, 
with the understanding that we do not there-
by waive any future jurisdictional claim 
over those provisions or their subject mat-
ters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR, 
Washington, DC, November 5, 2020. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: In reference to 
your letter of November 5, 2020, I write to 
confirm our mutual understanding regarding 
H.R. 8294, the ‘‘National Apprenticeship Act 
of 2020.’’ 
I appreciate the Committee on the Judi-
ciary’s waiver of consideration of H.R. 8294 
as specified in your letter. I acknowledge 
that the waiver was granted only to expedite 
floor consideration of H.R. 8294 and does not 
in any way waive or diminish the Committee 
on the Judiciary’s jurisdictional interests 
over this or similar legislation. 
I would be pleased to include our exchange 
of letters on this matter in the committee 
report for H.R. 8294 and in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill 
to memorialize our joint understanding. 
Again, thank you for your assistance with 
this matter. 
Very truly yours, 
ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT, 
Chairman. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 8294, which kills the abil-
ity for businesses and industry to fill 
in-demand jobs. 
Republicans and Democrats agree 
that apprenticeships play a critical 
role in addressing our Nation’s work-
force needs and preparing workers for 
meaningful, well-paying careers; how-
ever,

narrow-minded 
approach

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5966 
November 19, 2020 
taken by Democrats in H.R. 8294 dou-
bles down on a system that limits ap-
prenticeship opportunities. 
Many who know me here in Congress 
know that I have advocated for these 
job-creating programs all my career. 
Nothing can prepare a student quite 
like on-the-job experience, and appren-
ticeships are a tried-and-true method 
of preparing students to enter the 
workforce with the skills they need to 
succeed. 
Unfortunately, the potential for a 
strong bipartisan effort to expand be-
yond the existing registered appren-
ticeship model to reach more workers 
and industries has been eclipsed by the 
Democrats’ typical partisan games. 
While our economy continues to re-
cover from COVID–19, workers and job 
creators need the flexibility to inno-
vate. Republicans understand that em-
ployers, not Washington bureaucrats, 
know best what skills their employees 
require to excel in the workplace. 
The Trump administration also rec-
ognizes the importance of employer-led 
innovation in the apprenticeship space 
and has taken important steps to ex-
pand and innovate work-based learning 
programs. More than 430 companies 
and organizations have signed the 
President’s pledge to American work-
ers, committing to providing more 
than 16 million new education and on- 
the-job 
learning 
opportunities 
for 
American students and workers. 
Additionally, 
the 
Department 
of 
Labor is moving forward with Indus-
try-Recognized 
Apprenticeship 
Pro-
grams to give employers the flexibility 
to shape apprenticeship programs that 
will attract workers and prepare them 
for the 21st century. 
We have seen real success stories un-
fold when we let employers innovate. 
Opportunity America and the Brook-
ings Institution recently published a 
study on the Federation for Advanced 
Manufacturing Education, or FAME, 
an organization that connects edu-
cators, employers, and students with 
hands-on learning to strengthen the 
manufacturing industry. 
The study found Kentucky FAME 
graduates, when compared to their 
non-FAME counterparts, earned up to 
63 percent more 1 year after gradua-
tion. Five years after, FAME graduates 
earned $98,000, compared to $52,783 for 
non-FAME graduates. 
This study represents not only a suc-
cess story in Kentucky, but it uncovers 
a larger narrative. There is untapped 
potential in the apprenticeship space 
waiting to be unleashed because the ex-
isting registered model doesn’t meet 
the need of many companies right now. 
Instead of giving workers and em-
ployers more autonomy to create pro-
grams that are responsive to workforce 
needs, the Democrats’ bill clings to an 
80-year-old system that shuts the door 
on flexibility and innovation and en-
shrines union giveaways. 
In a letter to Committee Repub-
licans, John Pallasch, Assistant Sec-
retary for Employment and Training at 
the Department of Labor, cautioned 
that ‘‘if enacted, this bill would inhibit 
the ability of the Department to fulfill 
its mission in providing more Ameri-
cans access to apprenticeships.’’ Mr. 
Pallasch went on to warn that H.R. 
8294 puts job-filling programs in jeop-
ardy due to an ‘‘excessive number of re-
quirements that are overly prescrip-
tive.’’ 
Still, House Democrats want to make 
registered apprenticeships the only 
possible model under the National Ap-
prenticeship Act. This approach is 
flawed. The numbers speak for them-
selves. In fiscal year 2019, 252,000 indi-
viduals entered apprenticeships, and 
only 81,000 graduated from the reg-
istered system. 
It is obvious that we can and should 
do better, but Democrats are turning a 
blind eye to needed improvements that 
will allow more Americans to get back 
to work and achieve the American 
Dream. 
The bill before us will force job cre-
ators to deal with overly prescriptive 
requirements, additional bureaucracy, 
and time-consuming paperwork. This 
stifling environment has discouraged 
new and small businesses from partici-
pating in the registered apprenticeship 
system for years now. 
The majority claims that this legis-
lation will create 1 million new appren-
ticeship programs simply by virtue of 
throwing more money at the registered 
system without solving the underlying 
problems that prevent employers from 
participating or allowing for alter-
native models. It seems the new defini-
tion of insanity is the Federal Govern-
ment spending more taxpayer dollars 
on decades-old programs and expecting 
different results. 
An all-of-the-above approach is the 
best way to connect more workers with 
apprenticeship opportunities so they 
can secure meaningful, well-paying ca-
reers. That is why Republicans on the 
Education and Labor Committee intro-
duced a commonsense amendment dur-
ing the bill’s markup to unleash the 
full potential of apprenticeships and 
help fill in-demand jobs. 
Among other provisions, it would 
allow the Department of Labor the 
flexibility to pursue other forms of 
work-based learning under the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act, including in 
response to COVID–19. It would reduce 
the paperwork burden on States by al-
lowing them to submit State plans 
under the preexisting framework of the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
Act rather than forcing them to estab-
lish a duplicative application process. 
b 1515 
Rarely is more government interven-
tion the solution, which is why the 
amendment would strike provisions in 
H.R. 8294 that would add to the existing 
bureaucracy in the form of advisory 
committees and interagency agree-
ments. The amendment also provides 
States with more discretion over how 
they spend their money, instead of let-
ting the Federal Government dictate 
where their dollars must go. 
This amendment also makes it easier 
for more programs, and therefore, more 
apprentices to access the registered ap-
prenticeship system by removing the 
requirement setting an uneven playing 
field between union and nonunion pro-
gram sponsors for the ratios of appren-
tices to instructors. This particular 
provision is just another scheme by 
Democrats 
to 
force 
workers 
into 
unions. Unfortunately, this common-
sense, forward-looking amendment was 
struck down on a party line vote by 
committee Democrats. 
Thankfully, the full House will have 
the opportunity to vote on this amend-
ment during floor consideration, and I 
hope Democrats will take this oppor-
tunity to adopt legislation that will ac-
tually increase work-based learning op-
portunities. 
At a time when workers and job cre-
ators are working hard to overcome 
the challenges presented by COVID–19, 
we shouldn’t close potential pathways 
to work. Apprenticeships can help put 
more Americans to work as we recover 
from the pandemic, but only if job cre-
ators are given the flexibility to inno-
vate and develop high quality earn- 
and-learn programs. And the Democrat 
bill fails on that front. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the House ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, the chairman of the Edu-
cation 
and 
Labor 
Committee, 
Mr. 
BOBBY SCOTT, for yielding. He has done 
such an extraordinary job through the 
years in the minority and in the major-
ity watching out for workers and cre-
ating jobs and security for our work-
ers. 
I rise in strong support of this legis-
lation. 
Two weeks ago, Mr. Speaker, we saw 
deep divisions within our country, divi-
sions that we must heal. 
Part of that division, I believe, comes 
from a broad lack of faith in govern-
ment to deliver on what the American 
people need to get ahead in our econ-
omy. 
Americans, in my view, want their 
elected officials to focus on reaching 
consensus on broadly popular initia-
tives that expand opportunity and con-
nect people with good careers. 
This legislation, Mr. Speaker, that 
we are considering today, falls within 
the scope of the Make It In America 
plan that I have been proud to lead 
since 2010. 
That plan seeks to make our workers 
and businesses more competitive by 
legislating in the three key areas of 
education and skills training, infra-
structure, and entrepreneurship. It is 
based on bipartisan ideas that most 
Americans support. 
One of those ideas is reauthorizing

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5967 
November 19, 2020 
Act for the 21st century in order to 
help more of our people reach for the 
opportunities that enable them to 
make it in America. 
This bill would have been, Mr. Speak-
er, and should have been, bipartisan, 
were it not for the Trump administra-
tion’s 
insistence 
on 
including 
unaccredited and unproven apprentice-
ship programs that do not have ade-
quate worker protections or quality 
standards. 
That is a shame. And I hope we can 
revisit this effort and make it truly bi-
partisan once President-elect Biden has 
taken office. 
At a moment when our economy is in 
crisis as a result of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, many Americans are out of 
work and looking for new ways to get 
back into the workforce. 
They recognize that this moment 
presents an opportunity to gain new 
skills and move up in their careers, as 
Mr. SCOTT has pointed out. 
That is why, Mr. Speaker, congres-
sional support for apprenticeship pro-
grams is so important. 
According to the Labor Department, 
94 percent of participants in registered 
apprenticeships 
are 
employed 
upon 
completion with an average salary of 
$70,000. 
This bill would permanently author-
ize the Labor Department’s office of 
apprenticeship and direct it to promote 
new partnerships among labor, indus-
try, and educational institutions to 
create new apprenticeship tracks. 
It will also codify standards, Mr. 
Speaker, 
for 
registered 
apprentice-
ships, 
youth 
apprenticeships, 
and 
preapprenticeship programs. 
This legislation would invest more 
than $3 billion in the National Appren-
ticeship System, an investment that 
will pay off geometrically to our coun-
try and to our families and to our 
workers. That will be spent over the 
next 5 years in order to create nearly 
one million additional apprenticeship 
opportunities by 2025. 
For those worried about the cost of 
this legislation, here is another figure 
to consider: The $10.6 billion in in-
creased tax revenues and decreased 
spending on public assistance programs 
and unemployment insurance that will 
be saved. Let me reiterate that. $10.6 
billion in increased tax revenue as a re-
sult of the success of the apprentice-
ship program. 
At the same time, this bill includes 
measures to promote greater diversity 
among those accessing apprenticeship 
programs. This is critical at a moment 
when the pandemic has led women’s 
workforce participation to fall to a 
level unseen since 1988. 
Right now, only 10 percent of appren-
ticeships are held by women. 
By promoting greater diversity of ac-
cess, we can increase that percentage 
dramatically 
and 
help 
millions 
of 
women jump-start their return to the 
workforce while helping them get 
ahead in their careers. Good for them, 
good for their families, good for Amer-
ica. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
SUSAN DAVIS of California for her lead-
ership over the years and for spon-
soring this bill. She has been a cham-
pion for workers and apprenticeship op-
portunities for decades. She will be 
leaving the Congress, and she will be 
sorely missed. She will be leaving vol-
untarily, I may add. But she will be 
sorely missed, because, not only in the 
civilian sector but on the defense side, 
she has looked at personnel and how to 
enhance work opportunities, worker 
skills, and their success. 
I also thank Chairman SCOTT of the 
Education and Labor Committee for 
his work moving this bill through com-
mittee. 
I also want to thank the ranking 
member because I believe that, in fact, 
what she said is she is interested in ap-
prenticeship programs, and I am hope-
ful that Mr. SCOTT and Ms. FOXX and 
others on both sides of the aisle con-
tinue to work to expand apprenticeship 
opportunities. We do not want to con-
strict opportunities; we want to expand 
them. 
In spite of the Trump Administra-
tion’s attempts to sabotage it, I hope 
this legislation will pass with the kind 
of strong bipartisan support it de-
serves. 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in 
voting for a bill that will give all of our 
people faith that Washington is united 
in our determination to help them get 
through this crisis and build back bet-
ter in the future. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP-
SON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished 
Republican leader of our Education and 
Labor Committee for yielding and for 
her service. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 8294, the National Appren-
ticeship Act of 2020. 
Originally passed in 1937, the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act established 
the registered apprenticeship system 
that we have come to know. 
For more than 80 years, this system 
has provided many Americans with op-
portunities to learn tangible skills 
they need for high-wage, high-skill, 
and in-demand jobs that will lead to 
fulfilling careers. 
Most recently, we have seen interest 
for apprenticeships surge as more em-
ployees and small businesses are recog-
nizing the critical role that they play 
in the development of a skilled work-
force. 
This law is in desperate need of re-
forms that will both strengthen and ex-
pand this traditional system while em-
powering employers and others to pur-
sue work-based learning innovation. 
As co-chair of the bipartisan Career 
and Technical Education Caucus, I 
have always supported, and will con-
tinue to support, legislation that pro-
motes skills-based education for a 21st 
century economy. 
With that being said, we must ac-
knowledge that the registered appren-
ticeship system created during the 
Great Depression will never be suitable 
by itself for a modern workforce. 
And on this point, this bill ignores 
the needs of our workers and our econ-
omy now in the 21st century. 
The Trump administration has taken 
tremendous steps to grow the number 
of high quality apprenticeships and 
modernize work-based learning pro-
grams, especially through the Depart-
ment of Labor’s Industry-Recognized 
Apprenticeship Programs, or IRAPS. 
This program is aimed to help foster 
continued innovation that recognizes 
the dignity of all work and provides an-
other tool for apprentices to move into 
meaningful work in our rapidly evolv-
ing economy. 
Mr. Speaker, there is room for an all- 
of-the-above approach that both im-
proves the registered system while also 
allowing for future innovation and 
other earn-and-learn models. 
However, this legislation does not 
change the current status quo. 
For that reason, I must urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill. 
We must craft a bipartisan bill that 
encourages employers to innovate and 
develop apprenticeship programs that 
meet the needs of the current work-
place. 
Employers 
are 
struggling 
enough 
with 
the 
challenges 
presented 
by 
COVID–19. The last thing they need is 
additional red tape and tenuous re-
quirements. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. DAVIS), chair of 
the Subcommittee on Higher Edu-
cation and Workforce Investment and 
the lead sponsor of the legislation we 
are considering today. 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Chairman SCOTT for yield-
ing and for being a strong partner over 
the years in recognizing the impor-
tance of investing in America’s work-
force development. 
While we look to the robust appren-
ticeship systems of Switzerland, the 
U.K. and other countries, we know that 
the United States has the potential to 
have our own unique, highly effective 
environment for a mentor-led work-
force. And today we can put resources 
behind our need to match employers 
addressing community needs with our 
constituents who seek skills and edu-
cation. 
At a time when many workers have 
been forced to look for new pathways 
to financial stability, we have a re-
sponsibility as Members of Congress to 
expand employment opportunities that 
provide meaningful work and family- 
supporting wages. 
The legislation under consideration 
today will do just that. 
We have had many conversations in 
our Education and Labor Committee 
about providing high quality edu-
cational pathways, and I appreciate the 
work of the ranking member on that

regard. And we have spent much time 
together talking about this issue. 
But I want to go on to pinpoint those 
issues that have to be included. The 
educational pathways that we know do 
not require a 4-year college degree that 
allow people to earn while they learn. 
Makes sense. And provide nationally 
portable and recognized credentials. 
We have tirelessly worked for months 
with our Republican colleagues to 
make sure this legislation achieves 
these goals. 
This past March, just before the 
world changed as we know it, we made 
public a draft of this legislation that 
was open for feedback. We were able to 
incorporate comments from over 20 
groups and stakeholders. And this leg-
islation also incorporated feedback 
from the bipartisan hearings and round 
tables we had with employers and ap-
prenticeship stakeholders. 
One of the legislation’s primary goals 
is to ensure that people across the 
country are speaking the same lan-
guage regarding apprenticeships. 
It is designed to demonstrate that 
apprenticeships are an equal, high- 
quality, post-secondary, prestigious al-
ternative to the traditional 2- or 4-year 
college degrees. 
Of great interest, this bill codifies 
youth apprenticeships as opportunities 
that prepare high school students for 
post-secondary education, much like 
advanced placement classes. 
We have already seen how a small in-
vestment from the Federal Govern-
ment results in enormous returns. In 
2017, the insurance company Aon start-
ed their business in Chicago with only 
two employees and 25 apprentices. 
Now, they have over 50 employees and 
over 750 apprentices all across the 
country. In fact, they have announced 
the expansion of their Chicago appren-
ticeship network to cities and employ-
ers across the country who are fol-
lowing their lead in looking at reg-
istered apprenticeship credentials as 
alternatives to a 4-year degree. 
b 1530 
But here is the key. As the CEO of 
AON himself stated: ‘‘The biggest ob-
stacle to success at scale is not in find-
ing a qualified supply of talent, it is 
incenting employers to create the de-
mand for quality, career-track jobs 
that look beyond traditional hiring 
practices,’’ which is precisely what this 
bill sets out to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from AON’s CEO Greg Case 
highlighting their and other employ-
ers’ excitement about the expansion of 
the registered apprenticeship system 
and demonstrating how many firms 
have not only not been hindered by the 
current registered system, but rather 
are enormous beneficiaries of it. 
AON, 
Chicago, IL, November 16, 2020. 
Hon. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT, 
Chairman, House Committee on Education and 
Labor, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT: Thank you for your 
leadership and support in the effort to grow 
apprenticeship programs across the country. 
Our employees are the foundation of our 
company and young people across the coun-
try are the future of our workforce. Finding 
a way to both create opportunity and by 
doing so, reach the best talent, is a challenge 
we can all embrace. We are very proud that 
the apprentice model we created in Chicago 
in 2017 with two employers and 25 appren-
tices has grown to 43 employers and over 750 
apprentices—it proves that talent plus op-
portunity equals success. 
Because of the success of the Chicago Ap-
prentice Network and the positive impact 
this talent strategy has had for our firm, 
Aon announced yesterday that we will be ex-
panding our Apprenticeship commitment to 
seven cities across the United States sup-
ported by an investment of $30 million over 
the next five years. 
Aon will initiate the Apprenticeship pro-
gram expansion next year in the metropoli-
tan areas of Chicago, Houston, Minneapolis, 
New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and 
Washington, D.C. Along with this expansion, 
Aon will lead the development of a nation-
wide network of employers to create 10,000 
new apprenticeships across the United States 
by 2030. 
This development of apprenticeships in the 
office and corporate sector allows a model 
that has been successful in the trades—earn-
ing while you learn—to expand to fast grow-
ing areas of the economy. And like other 
successful apprenticeship programs, ours are 
and will continue to be, registered with the 
Department of Labor to ensure quality of 
both training and work. 
We live in a world of rapid change and in-
creased volatility in the economy and the 
job market. In building the workforce of the 
future, the biggest obstacle to success at 
scale is not in finding a qualified supply of 
talent, it is incenting employers to create 
the demand for quality, career track jobs 
that look beyond traditional hiring prac-
tices. By creating a working model that has 
grown across industries, we can show others 
the path to success in creating apprentice 
programs in the corporate sector. 
Aon’s apprenticeship program has brought 
so many talented colleagues to our firm and 
we know it has tremendous potential to cre-
ate similar opportunities and professional 
networks for both apprentices and partici-
pating employers across the United States. 
We thank you again for your efforts and 
stand ready to assist in the expansion of our 
model to communities across the United 
States as we create the workforce of the fu-
ture. 
Best, 
GREG CASE. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman. 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Mr. SCOTT for yielding me 
the additional time. 
We all talk a good game in wanting 
to build this economy and build oppor-
tunities for our constituents who do 
not want to pursue a 4-year degree, but 
we haven’t put financial muscle and 
know-how behind creating these valued 
credentials that employees seek. 
In closing, I want to make one point, 
that this legislation only codifies the 
standards for programs that have reg-
istered for access to the credentials 
and funding provided for in this bill. 
Unregistered workforce programs that 
do not want access to this bill’s re-
sources will not need to change their 
programs. 
We are simply strengthening the 
known registered apprenticeship sys-
tem that is in place today with more 
clearly established programs. Families 
can sit down at the kitchen table, dis-
cuss their futures, and look to the reju-
venated registered apprenticeship sys-
tem as one of many high-quality path-
ways to post-secondary education. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to compliment the 
gentlewoman from California (Con-
gresswoman DAVIS) for her work on 
this bill and her career in Congress. We 
all respect her. And I earnestly wish we 
could have come up with a bipartisan 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER). 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. And I 
agree. I wish we could have come here 
with a bill that we all can agree upon. 
Unfortunately, instead, I have to say I 
oppose the bill that we are discussing 
today. 
This is particularly important be-
cause, over the past few months, we see 
the impact that the pandemic has had 
on our workforce. All of us standing 
here today are fortunate to be in posi-
tions where we can learn to do our jobs 
differently. We can do them differently 
whether it is remotely, or we can im-
plement new safety measures, or some 
combination of the two. 
But there are millions of Americans 
who don’t get that opportunity to work 
remotely. Instead, they have lost their 
jobs. 
We all know that the workforce will 
not look the same once this public 
health emergency is over. So it is more 
imperative than ever that we take ac-
tions to help job-displaced individuals 
learn new skill sets to be competitive 
and to fit these new jobs that will be 
available. 
Expanding apprenticeships 
is 
one 
tool to help accomplish that goal. The 
bill before us today presented a real op-
portunity for Congress to make smart 
reforms to our apprenticeship system 
when it is needed most, but unfortu-
nately, H.R. 8294 comes up short in 
achieving this. 
Now, I will say as well that through-
out my past 2 years serving as the 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Higher Education and Workforce In-
vestment, I have enjoyed working 
alongside Chairwoman DAVIS. 
As we looked at other models, we 
studied both U.S. models and inter-
national models of apprenticeship as 
well. We held hearings and received 
testimony from officials from coun-
tries like Switzerland, Australia, Ger-
many, and Belgium. 
What struck us most was that each of 
those nations has apprenticeships in 
nearly every single industry, not just a 
few like we have here in the U.S. From 
banking to positions in the healthcare

industry, these nations have managed 
to find a structure, a system that can 
respond to labor market demands while 
preparing the next generation with val-
uable skill sets. 
While we do agree in a bipartisan 
fashion that these are models that we 
could learn from as we reauthorize our 
own system, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle have chosen to 
steamroll over proposals for flexibility 
and double down on a registered sys-
tem that places much of the decision-
making authority into the hands of 
labor unions. 
The majority leader was correct 
when he said just a little while ago on 
the floor that that is the fundamental 
difference of the two sides on this bill. 
This bill as written strips the Depart-
ment of Labor’s authority to pursue 
more flexible partnerships for work- 
based learning models. This legislation 
would prevent the Department from 
moving forward with the Industry-Rec-
ognized Apprenticeship Programs, or 
IRAPs. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentleman. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, even 
though IRAPs are in the early stages, 
we are already seeing many new stake-
holders getting involved. The program 
is showing tremendous promise, and we 
are finally starting to grow apprentice-
ship programs in industries that have 
never used them before. 
We believe in allowing businesses to 
make the decisions they believe are 
best for their employees to learn the 
skills that they need. That is the fun-
damental difference in the approach to 
apprenticeship. 
I will be offering an amendment that 
will allow the law to reach the full po-
tential of apprenticeships to help fill 
in-demand jobs by addressing some of 
these issues. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS), the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Work-
force Protections. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT), our distinguished Education 
and Labor Committee chair, as well as 
the Subcommittee on Higher Edu-
cation 
and 
Workforce 
Investment 
chair, Mrs. DAVIS, for this bill and for 
all of their support. 
I rise today in strong support of the 
National Apprenticeship Reauthoriza-
tion Act. By creating 1 million new ap-
prenticeship opportunities and yielding 
over $10 billion in net benefits, this leg-
islation is a lifeline for our economy 
and for countless Americans, including 
those in my home State of North Caro-
lina. 
With a proven track record of suc-
cess, we know this is a safe and smart 
investment. 
I am also pleased that this legisla-
tion includes my bill, the Apprentice-
ship Access for All Act. This language 
will advance programs that promote 
the recruitment, employment, and re-
tention of people of color, individuals 
with disabilities, and individuals facing 
barriers to employment, especially in 
high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand 
sectors and occupations. After all, we 
must be sure that everyone has access 
to opportunity. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, to my col-
leagues, especially those on the other 
side of the aisle, I want to be clear 
about what we are voting to do here. 
We are voting to ensure our work-
force gets the investment it needs and 
the support it deserves. We are voting 
to show the American people that they 
are seen, that they are heard, and that 
we care deeply about providing them 
pathways to a stable future. And we 
are voting to uphold Congress’ commit-
ment and obligation to serve every 
American. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to, with the other people, 
say it was very enjoyable working with 
Congresswoman 
DAVIS. 
I 
wish 
she 
would have given me a chance before 
she made a decision to try to convince 
her to stay here because we are going 
to miss her. 
Apprenticeships are very important. 
We have a good apprenticeship pro-
gram in Wisconsin. We are told that, 
right now, people who complete both 
the work and classroom requirements 
of the apprenticeship program have a 
median income of $80,000. That shows 
the importance of having a bill like 
this brought to the floor. And I will 
tell you, it is not only an $80,000 salary 
but, I am sure, a much lower debt load 
than many people who use a 4-year de-
gree. 
I think it is important for everybody 
in this Chamber to continue to empha-
size to young people the pathway to a 
career through apprenticeships, which 
probably results in more job security, 
more income, and less debt than other 
things. 
It is with great regret I am going to 
vote against this bill today. 
I do believe that there is such a high 
demand for what I call skills-based 
education that it is important we open 
up alternative avenues to apprentice-
ships. 
We have talked today about a need to 
recognize the apprenticeship programs. 
That is certainly one way. It is unfor-
tunate that didn’t make it in this bill. 
I know a lot of effort was made to 
make this a bipartisan bill, and maybe 
we can come back in the appropria-
tions process or something and some-
how make a few tweaks in there to 
make it something that would be more 
bipartisan. 
But I am glad the bill is coming this 
far. It provides us all an opportunity to 
go back home in our districts and bring 
it up to young people and tell them 
about the benefits of apprenticeships 
and that you are missing something 
big-time if you don’t take advantage of 
it. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS), a 
graduate of a registered apprenticeship 
program himself and a member of the 
Committee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about the importance of 
the National Apprenticeship Reauthor-
ization Act. 
Personally, Mr. Speaker, I want to 
say thank you to SUSAN DAVIS and, cer-
tainly, Chairman SCOTT
for putting 
this bill up. I am thankful that so 
many of the priorities are included in 
this, ones that I have spoken so highly 
of. 
Last week was National Apprentice-
ship Week. As many may know, reg-
istered apprenticeship programs have 
literally shaped my life. While my 
three brothers went to college, I went 
to the other 4-year school. I did an 
IBEW apprenticeship program to be-
come an electrician. 
‘‘Learn while you earn’’ was my life. 
I understood that, that you could take 
the knowledge that you learn at night 
at school in the books and take it right 
to the job. That is the heart of what an 
apprenticeship program is. 
I supported my young family. I was 
able to continue that. I literally went 
from the construction site to Congress. 
Education is not one-size-fits-all. We 
hear that. For many, they don’t know 
if they want to go to college, build the 
college, or defend the college. We need 
all of those, and that is how important 
it is. 
The registered apprenticeship system 
is the most successful Federal work-
force training program in the history 
of the United States. Ninety-four per-
cent of those people will have a job, 
when they complete their apprentice-
ship, with a starting wage average of 
$70,000. It works. 
But it is more than just a paycheck. 
It is about the dignity of a job, the re-
spect that comes with that. 
In our country, there are so many 
ways that you can succeed. Whether 
you are an apprentice in the shipyard, 
a medical tech, a Ph.D. from Harvard, 
they are all the same in terms of value 
to this great country. We need all of 
them. 
The National Apprenticeship Act in-
vests $3.5 billion in a proven, successful 
system that has created over 1 million 
new opportunities. But how important 
the standards are, particularly in the 
world that I come from. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, why 
standards are so important is because

when 
storms 
hit 
our 
coast, 
elec-
tricians, linemen, come from around 
the country to put that system back 
together. Could you imagine if they all 
had their own program? 
This is why standards count, particu-
larly in the building trades, because 
when there is not work in your home-
town, you go to work in another. We 
all work together, and that is why this 
is so important. 
Since 1937, we haven’t updated it. But 
just because it is old doesn’t mean it is 
not good. 
It is handed down through genera-
tions. This is how we have trained and 
given the next generation a proven, 
successful model. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the North America’s 
Building Trades Unions that talks 
about the importance of what we are 
talking about today. 
NORTH AMERICA’S 
BUILDING TRADES UNIONS, 
Washington, DC, November 18, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: On behalf of the over 3 million skilled 
craft professionals that comprise North 
America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU), 
I write in support of H.R. 8294, the National 
Apprenticeship Act of 2020. 
I first would like to commend the work of 
the House Committee on Education and 
Labor for their diligent efforts to maintain 
the integrity of the Registered Apprentice-
ship system and for their willingness to en-
gage us on this bill, which reauthorizes the 
foundational law on which our apprentice-
ship programs are built. In the eighty-three 
years since the Registered Apprenticeship 
system was created, our nation, the econ-
omy, our industry and technology have dras-
tically changed. What has not changed is the 
need to forever protect and enshrine the 
rights of those individuals who enter an ap-
prenticeship program, and H.R. 8294 con-
tinues to protect the safety, well-being, and 
economic trajectory of the apprentice. 
More than two-thirds of all civilian reg-
istered apprentices in the United States are 
trained in the construction industry. Among 
these construction apprentices, seventy-five 
percent receive their training at one of the 
1,600 privately funded training centers which 
are jointly administered by construction 
contractors and building trades unions. In-
vesting over $1.6 billion in private capital an-
nually in our Registered Apprenticeship pro-
grams, the affiliated unions of NABTU pro-
vide a debt-free ladder of opportunity to 
those who seek a career in the construction 
industry. Our joint labor-management pro-
grams have long been considered the gold 
standard of the Registered Apprenticeship 
system. 
The National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 
protects many of the hallmarks of the cur-
rent system. This bill protects the progres-
sive wage scale for apprentices, which is 
often a target of those in our industry who 
seek to put profits above the well-being and 
economic security of the people they em-
ploy. This bill protects the time-based model 
of apprenticeship training that our programs 
have effectively utilized for decades, while 
providing flexibility for new industries that 
wish to enter the Registered Apprenticeship 
system. This bill also protects apprentices 
by codifying regulations that recognize col-
lective bargaining agreements contain ex-
ceptionally 
strong 
apprentice-to- 
journeyworker ratios that not only ensure 
on-going, targeted instruction, but also the 
level of supervision apprentices need to guar-
antee their safety. 
H.R. 8294 also makes some very important 
changes to the Registered Apprenticeship 
program that NABTU has long fought for. 
For the first time, there will be concrete 
standards associated with pre-apprenticeship 
programs, which have exponentially grown 
over the last several years as we continue to 
work with our industry partners to increase 
the diversity of apprenticeship candidates by 
recruiting women, people of color and vet-
erans. No longer can unscrupulous contrac-
tors prop up pre-apprenticeship programs 
without having clear and defined pathways 
into a Registered Apprenticeship program. 
Furthermore, H.R. 8294 codifies the Office 
of Apprenticeship, with established funding 
streams to ensure the necessary oversight of 
the program and expand technical assistance 
that will grow Registered Apprenticeship op-
portunities 
in 
new 
sectors. 
This 
bill 
strengthens the National Advisory Com-
mittee on Apprenticeship, ensuring that 
practitioners of Registered Apprenticeship, 
both industry and labor, are given a voice to 
offer recommendations to further strengthen 
the program. 
While there are other avenues one may 
take to be trained in the construction crafts, 
for generations, the safest, most highly- 
skilled and productive construction craft 
workers in the world have received their 
training through the Registered Apprentice-
ship system. H.R. 8294, the National Appren-
ticeship Act of 2020, will ensure the Reg-
istered Apprenticeship system not only re-
mains the gold standard in workforce train-
ing in the construction industry, but that it 
is accessible for all industries that seek a 
productive and highly-skilled workforce. I 
urge swift passage of this bill, and look for-
ward to working with you to strengthen eco-
nomic opportunities in every community, 
both large and small, across our great na-
tion. 
Sincerely, 
SEAN MCGARVEY, 
President. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support the National 
Apprenticeship Reauthorization Act so 
we can make sure we put America back 
to work. 
b 1545 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to H.R. 8294. 
I, too, come from the construction in-
dustry, which I learned from the 
ground up, and I know firsthand how 
apprenticeships provide our workforce 
with a unique opportunity to gain val-
uable skills that are needed to secure a 
good-paying job and a long-lasting ca-
reer. 
The reason apprenticeships are so 
successful is because employers know 
exactly what skills are in demand. 
That is why we must encourage more 
employer-led innovation in the appren-
ticeship space. 
This legislation denies workers and 
employers autonomy to create pro-
grams that are responsive to workforce 
needs. This shortsighted bill would 
undo the Department of Labor’s indus-
try-recognized 
apprenticeship 
pro-
grams created under President Trump. 
This program provides companies an 
alternative avenue to train skilled 
workers and develop apprenticeship 
programs for their specific industry 
needs. 
This year has already been tough on 
our employers with COVID–19, dev-
astating businesses across the country, 
and the last thing we need is to impose 
more bureaucratic red tape and re-
quirements. 
I am disappointed that my Democrat 
colleagues are pushing a plan that 
would put these job-filling programs in 
jeopardy and prevent more workers 
from accessing these opportunities. 
I believe that this is a space for bi-
partisanship, and I urge my colleagues 
to oppose this flawed approach and 
work with us to encourage innovation 
and flexibility. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
could you advise us how much time is 
remaining on both sides.

tleman from Virginia has 161⁄2 minutes

North Carolina has 121⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Mrs. 
HAYES), 
a 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the National Ap-
prenticeship Act of 2020. 
My State of Connecticut was still re-
covering from the 2008 recession, and 
now COVID–19 has again thrown it into 
dire economic straits. 
With businesses shuttered from pro-
longed economic pause, nearly 200,000 
Connecticut residents are now forced 
into unemployment. If we say we agree 
on this, then now is the time to create 
pathways to high-wage employment 
with long-term prospects. While a 4- 
year degree is a great opportunity for 
many, it cannot be the only option. 
I include in the RECORD a letter in 
support of the National Apprenticeship 
Act from the National Education Asso-
ciation. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, November 18, 2020. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of our 3 
million members, who prepare students 
across America to pursue fulfilling careers 
that support their families and communities, 
we urge you to vote YES on the National Ap-
prenticeship Act of 2020 (H.R. 8294). Votes on 
this issue may be included in the NEA Re-
port Card for the 116th Congress. 
Apprenticeship programs are a key part of 
the education landscape, yet the National 
Apprenticeship Act has not been signifi-
cantly updated in the nearly 80 years since it 
was signed into law. H.R. 8294 recognizes 
that programs offering on-the-job training 
and mentoring pave the way to successful ca-
reers, and helps bring these programs into 
the 21st century. The legislation is particu-
larly timely given rising joblessness and fi-
nancial 
insecurity 
stemming 
from 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5971 
November 19, 2020 
The National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 
would: 
Create the Office of Apprenticeship in the 
U.S. Department of Labor, with responsibil-
ities including supporting development of 
apprenticeship models, providing technical 
assistance to state agencies, updating re-
quirements for each occupation in the pro-
gram, and determining whether to approve 
new occupations for the program; 
Codify provisions implemented over the 
years regarding registered apprenticeship 
programs and expand the programs to new 
industries; 
Amend the existing law to include pre-ap-
prenticeships and youth apprenticeships; and 
Authorize annual grants ranging from $400 
million to $800 million to expand apprentice-
ship programs and encourage employer par-
ticipation in them. 
The National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 
recognizes the value of apprenticeships in 
supporting the dreams and ambitions of stu-
dents of all ages and preparing them for 
high-wage careers. We urge you to vote YES 
on H.R. 8294. 
Sincerely, 
MARC EGAN, 
Director of Government Relations, 
National Education Association. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act ensures that 
today’s workforce can fill the jobs of 
tomorrow by creating 1 million appren-
ticeship opportunities over the next 5 
years. 
With an average starting salary, 
after completion, of around $70,000, reg-
istered apprenticeships create the op-
portunity to attain critical training 
while earning an income and incurring 
little to no student debt. Apprentice-
ships also ensure businesses can fill 
key 
vacancies 
with 
credentialed, 
skilled employees—in short, putting 
people back to work. 
The National Apprenticeship Act will 
invest in Connecticut workers and our 
country’s workers and businesses at a 
time when we need it most. I urge my 
colleagues to vote in favor of this legis-
lation. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER). 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 8294, the 
National Apprenticeship Act of 2020. 
Apprenticeship programs are a tre-
mendous benefit to our economy. They 
provide a diverse range of opportuni-
ties for emerging workers to hone and 
develop specific skills while providing 
competitive salaries that strengthen 
our economy. 
I agree with my colleagues that the 
National Apprenticeship Act needs to 
be updated and reauthorized; however, 
Congress needs to ensure that changes 
to this act accurately reflect the needs 
and challenges of the current economy 
and the modern workforce. 
H.R. 8294 fails to address and expand 
work-based learning programs beyond 
the traditional registered model. Now, 
more than ever, we need an apprentice-
ship system that provides tools and op-
portunities for workers to succeed and 
will encourage our small- and medium- 
sized businesses to participate. 
The existing apprenticeship system is 
severely outdated and is unresponsive 
to the needs and challenges of a dy-
namic workforce. The current adminis-
tration has addressed these needs by 
creating the Industry-Recognized Ap-
prenticeship Program, commonly re-
ferred to as IRAP. 
Twenty-five years working in private 
industry taught me that no one knows 
the needs of workers more than Amer-
ica’s employers. It is time that we 
allow these job creators to participate 
in a system that is reflective of their 
needs and the needs of the workforce. 
Doing so will open greater pathways to 
work for current workers and job seek-
ers and ultimately get more Americans 
back to work. 
In addition to these concerns, I must 
convey my strong opposition to the 
amendment offered by Representative 
LEVIN. The amendment essentially re-
stricts nonunion entities from being 
able to apply for funding under title II, 
allowing taxpayer dollars to go to ap-
prenticeship programs that partner 
only with unions. 
At best, it is signaling that Congress 
would rather double down on a union- 
registered model for large employers 
rather than expanding to new partici-
pants for America’s small business. 
This is an attempt to elevate the wants 
of unions over the needs of the Amer-
ican worker. 
Voting for H.R. 8294 in its current 
form supports outdated policies and bu-
reaucratic red tape that too often pre-
vents innovation and needed change. 
Most importantly, this bill would ac-
tively prevent IRAPs from moving for-
ward, decimating thousands of oppor-
tunities for workers to participate in a 
dynamic and innovative apprenticeship 
system. This is why we should not sup-
port this bill in its current form. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. SUOZZI). 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman SCOTT for yielding. 
I rise in support of the National Ap-
prenticeship Act. 
Since the late 1980s, the Dow Jones 
has gone up 1,400 percent; GDP has 
gone up 600 percent; enormous wealth 
has been created; yet workers’ wages 
during the same period of time have 
gone up only 20 percent or less. Hard-
working men and women have been left 
behind. 
Everyone in America believes, from 
the most conservative to the most pro-
gressive, that if you are willing to go 
to work every day, you should make 
enough money so you can have a de-
cent place to live, you can have health 
insurance, you can educate your chil-
dren, and you can retire one day with-
out being scared. 
Unfortunately, that American Dream 
is no longer a reality for many Ameri-
cans. The National Apprenticeship Act 
says learn while you earn, because we 
all know, the more you learn, the more 
you earn. Yet 60 percent of Americans 
do not attend college or do not grad-
uate from college. 
We must return to honoring the dig-
nity of work. We must make the skills 
necessary to be a welder or a plumber 
or a computer machinist or any skilled 
worker widely available to any high 
school student or graduate so that they 
can pursue noncollege opportunities 
like apprenticeship programs. There 
they can acquire the skills necessary 
to do the jobs that pay the wages nec-
essary to live a decent life. The Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act does just 
that. It is the key to the middle class. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, our bench on the Republican 
side is very strong, and it is especially 
strong because of the Representatives 
from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the incredible gentlewoman from North 
Carolina for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, in the last 10 years, the 
number of Americans entering appren-
ticeship programs has more than dou-
bled—a success. The demand among 
employers and workers in a variety of 
industries is an endorsement of the ap-
prenticeship model’s promise to close 
the skills gap and provide opportuni-
ties to millions of Americans—a great 
thing. 
The legislation we are considering 
today, however, would shut down ef-
forts to expand apprenticeships and 
make the existing 80-year-old reg-
istered apprenticeship program and 
system the only option. 
Talking to job creators in my dis-
trict, which I do extensively, I have 
heard firsthand the needs for talented, 
new workers and their challenges with 
the cumbersome apprenticeship system 
that limits employer-led innovation for 
union and nonunion employment. 
The registered apprenticeship system 
is not the gold standard; it is the old 
standard. American workers and em-
ployers need a system as innovative 
and dynamic as our current American 
economy. 
Republicans offered an all-of-the- 
above approach that improves the reg-
istered apprenticeship system and pro-
motes flexibilities to strengthen our 
workforce, particularly in manufac-
turing and construction, and would 
allow the apprenticeship model to be 
applied across all new industries such 
as tech, healthcare, logistics, and en-
ergy—particularly, Mr. Speaker, as we 
strive to fortify U.S. manufacturers 
and rebuild our infrastructure and 
repatriatize 
manufacturers 
from 
around the world, including China. 
We should not insist on ratio stand-
ards, but we should set very high gold 
standards. So we should focus on bak-
ing pies, not cutting them up. 
The economy workforce has evolved 
over the past 80 years. Our laws should, 
too. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), a senior mem-
ber of the Committee on Appropria-
tions.

November 19, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 8294, the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act of 2020, and 
thank the gentleman for his enormous 
leadership, as well as Chairwoman 
SUSAN DAVIS. 
This legislation takes real meaning-
ful steps to increase access to reg-
istered apprenticeships, one of the 
most successful workforce development 
programs we have ever had in our 
country, where 94 percent of people 
who complete them actually earn an 
average salary of over $70,000 a year. 
As Representative of the cities of To-
ledo, Lorain, and Cleveland, all of 
which boast a strong industrial and 
automotive heritage, it is difficult to 
overemphasize the value that these ap-
prenticeships have for young people 
and adults starting careers in the in-
dustrial and automotive trades. 
Whether it is the expertise it takes 
to rebuild an engine or build it to begin 
with, replace a battery in a hybrid ve-
hicle or TIG weld the rear quarter of an 
old Wagoneer, there will always be a 
market for skilled craftspeople who 
can repair or restore modern and clas-
sic vehicles. It is these curious minds 
and hands that are America’s inventors 
of the future for new power systems 
and new engines. 
This legislation is estimated to cre-
ate over 1 million apprenticeship op-
portunities over the next 5 years and 
will strengthen our workforce, ensur-
ing businesses large and small can re-
cruit the skilled workers they need. 
I include in the RECORD a letter from 
the 
National 
Task 
Force 
on 
Tradeswomen’s Issues that supports 
this legislation. 
NATIONAL TASK FORCE 
ON TRADESWOMEN’S ISSUES, 
November 18, 2020. 
Re H.R. 8294 Letter of Support, NAA Reau-
thorization. 
To: Committee on Education and Labor 
Chairperson Robert C. ‘‘Bobby’’ Scott 
Attention: Katherine McClelland. 
The National Taskforce on Tradeswomen’s 
Issues (TWTF) is a coalition of tradeswomen 
organizations, advocates, allies and indi-
vidual tradeswomen. TWTF promotes public 
policies and best practices towards equity in 
apprenticeship, training, workforce develop-
ment, career and technical education, and in 
workplace experience in construction and 
other nontraditional occupations for women. 
Women make up close to 50% of the nation’s 
workforce. Women occupy 2/3’s of the min-
imum wage jobs in this country. Yet, women 
comprise only 7% of our nation’s apprentice-
ship programs. Apprenticeship is a critical 
component of our efforts to increase eco-
nomic opportunity for women, particularly 
women of color, in blue-collar occupations. 
TWTF very much appreciates the interest 
of the House of Representatives Education & 
Labor Committee and its Higher Education 
& Workforce Investment Subcommittee in 
reauthorizing the National Apprenticeship 
Act in a way that best protects apprentices 
and enhances their opportunities for mean-
ingful, well-compensated careers. TWTF is 
grateful for the careful attention that the 
National Apprenticeship Act of 2020, H.R. 
8294, pays to ensuring that women and people 
of color—populations that have historically 
been too often unfairly denied opportunities 
because of their gender, race, or ethnicity— 
can gain access to and retain high-skill, 
high-wage jobs through registered appren-
ticeships, pre-apprenticeships, and youth ap-
prenticeships. Finally, we are very appre-
ciative of the open and consultative process 
that you and your staff have engaged in to 
get public input as you developed this bill, 
including allowing us to submit detailed 
comments on a publicly available discussion 
draft, and your staff’s willingness to respond 
to questions and concerns on an on-going 
basis. H.R. 8294 could well be a key piece to 
remedy the enduring skills and pay gap as 
we move beyond the ‘‘She-cession.’’ 
TWTF is pleased to support H.R. 8294. In 
particular, we support the bill’s incorpora-
tion of nondiscrimination and affirmative 
action standards for apprenticeship pro-
grams currently codified in 29 CFR part 30; 
the requirement that funded entities devote 
a minimum of 5 percent of grant funds to di-
rect financial assistance to apprentices, pre- 
apprentices, or youth apprentices for sup-
portive services; and the significant invest-
ments that the bill makes in registered ap-
prenticeship, pre-apprenticeship, and youth 
apprenticeship programs and technical as-
sistance to make progress on equity and in-
clusion for women and people of color. We 
look forward to continuing to work with 
your staff to accommodate remaining con-
cerns as the legislation moves forward in the 
next Congress. 
Respectfully, 
CONNIE ASHBROOK, 
LEAH RAMBO, 
TWTF Co-Chairs. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE), 
who has been an extremely valuable 
member of this committee, and we will 
miss him in the next term. 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 8294, the 
National Apprenticeship Act of 2020. 
The original National Apprenticeship 
Act was passed in 1937 and is now over 
80 years old. There is no doubt that 
Congress should update the Apprentice-
ship Act; however, the legislation being 
considered today will harm apprentice-
ships rather than aid workforce devel-
opment. 
H.R. 8294 removes the Department of 
Labor’s ability to administer industry- 
recognized 
apprenticeship 
programs, 
making only DOL-registered programs 
available. While DOL-approved pro-
grams work for many employers, one- 
size-fits-all solutions don’t work for 
many industries and are simply not the 
answer. 
Industry-recognized 
apprenticeship 
programs are developed by third-party 
groups that are recognized by the De-
partment of Labor. They are held to 
high standards to ensure apprentices 
are receiving the training that they 
need. 
IRAPs have already proven to be suc-
cessful in helping to expand access to 
apprenticeships. Somebody argued that 
IRAPs are harmful because they think 
it might limit involvement in union- 
sponsored apprenticeships. What these 
individuals do not think about are the 
areas of the country like mine where 
union-sponsored apprenticeships do not 
exist or are extremely limited. My 
home district has none. 
Not only does this legislation try to 
force one-size-fits-all programs on to 
apprentices and employers while favor-
ing unions, it also drastically increases 
the amount of bureaucratic red tape 
placed on States and program sponsors. 
Apprenticeship programs are fan-
tastic options for individuals to gain 
skills and find well-paying jobs and for 
businesses to grow and expand their 
workforce. Especially in a year that 
has greatly affected our workers, we 
should not pass legislation that threat-
ens to reduce access to workforce de-
velopment or makes it more difficult 
to run or establish an apprenticeship 
program. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD), a mem-
ber of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD a letter dated November 17, 
2020, from the International Union of 
Operating Engineers in support of this 
bill, addressed to the Honorable Robert 
C. Scott, chair of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
INTERNATIONAL UNION OF 
OPERATING ENGINEERS, 
Washington, DC, November 17, 2020. 
Hon. ROBERT C. SCOTT, 
Chair, Committee on Education and Labor, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT: The International 
Union of Operating Engineers supports H.R. 
8294, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2020, 
and we appreciate your work to strengthen 
and expand opportunities in America’s most 
successful training model for blue-collar 
workers: apprenticeship. 
The International Union of Operating En-
gineers (IUOE) represents 400,000 operating 
and stationary engineers who build the 
transportation, water systems, and energy 
networks that comprise the nation’s core in-
frastructure. In partnership with construc-
tion contractors and employers of stationary 
engineers, the IUOE dedicates resources to 
develop and implement nearly 100 registered 
apprenticeship programs. The programs pos-
sess over 550 instructors. and they train tens 
of thousands of apprentices and journey-level 
workers every year. This focus on training is 
reflected in the safety, skills. and produc-
tivity of members of the Operating Engi-
neers. 
Labor-management 
apprenticeship 
program of the IUOE and our employers are 
widely recognized as the gold standard of our 
industries and our occupations. 
Since the National Apprenticeship Act was 
first authorized in 1937, the Registered Ap-
prenticeship system has served as a model 
for delivering industry-driven training in the 
construction sector and beyond. According 
to the Department of Labor, 94 percent of ap-
prentices who complete Registered Appren-
ticeships are employed upon completion, 
earning an average starting wage of above 
$70,000 annually. Apprentice wages are con-
nected to experience, skill development, and 
productivity. The increase annually and in-
clude benefits like health insurance and a 
pension plan. The Registered Apprenticeship 
system remains a highly successful path for 
thousands of workers, providing a stable and 
predictable career path with economic secu-
rity. 
H.R. 8294, the National Apprenticeship Act 
of 2020 expands the limited framework of the 
existing Registered Apprenticeship program 
to reinforce quality standards that safeguard 
the welfare of apprentices. The legislation 
codifies and streamlines the existing regula-
tions and includes important reporting and

evaluation requirements to guarantee pro-
gram effectiveness and accountability. The 
legislation strengthens the connections to 
the career ladder for apprentices, more close-
ly linking pre-apprenticeship and youth ap-
prenticeship programs with the system of 
registered 
apprenticeship. 
The 
enhanced 
technical assistance in the legislation will 
help expand Registered Apprenticeship op-
portunities into new sectors. That technical 
assistance will also support more opportuni-
ties to improve diversity, bringing more 
women, people of color, and veterans into 
the system of apprenticeship. 
The value of this proven on-the-job train-
ing model is even more evident today as we 
navigate 
the 
unprecedented 
challenges 
brought on by the COVID–19 pandemic. The 
response to this extraordinary crisis will re-
quire extensive public investment to rebuild 
America’s infrastructure and its workforce. 
The National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 pro-
vides historic investments in workforce 
training, laying the foundation for economic 
recovery and preparing the skilled and quali-
fied workforce to rebuild our country. While 
the nation continues to experience stag-
gering levels of unemployment, the reau-
thorization of the National Apprenticeship 
Act, will expand job opportunities and in-
crease access to high-paying careers for mil-
lions of hard-working Americans. 
The International Union of Operating En-
gineers proudly endorses H.R. 8294, the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act of 2020, and we 
look forward to working with you to enact it 
into law during this session of Congress. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES T. CALLAHAN, 
General President. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the National Apprenticeship 
Act of 2020. 
COVID–19 has exposed shortcomings 
in our workforce infrastructure, but 
those shortcomings are the result of a 
long history of making only marginal 
investments in our national appren-
ticeship model. It seems we are always 
reacting to crisis rather than planning 
in advance. 
In response to the Great Recession of 
2008, 
Congress 
invested 
significant 
funding in our workforce systems. In 
this Congress, we made investments 
through the CARES Act, but only as 
this COVID crisis spiraled. 
b 1600 
It should not take a recession or a 
pandemic to invest in workers in com-
munities like mine. Lehigh, North-
ampton, and Monroe Counties are re-
plete with potential, but it is critical 
that we invest in times of prosperity, 
too. For every dollar invested in our 
registered apprenticeship program, we 
see a return of $28 in benefits, but the 
U.S. invests just $195 in public money 
per apprentice while a system like Can-
ada spends $1,300 per apprentice. 
This bill would reset our approach. It 
makes long-term investments regard-
less of our economic fortunes or mis-
fortunes. It provides grants for employ-
ers to incentivize the hiring of appren-
tices. At the same time, it provides 
workers with the opportunity to earn 
while they learn and obtain portable 
credentials without incurring signifi-
cant debt. This bill emphasizes the im-
portance of apprenticeship programs’ 
high-need social service occupations, 
like apprenticeship programs for early 
childhood educators, something Con-
gressman GUTHRIE and I have sought to 
do with our Early Educators Appren-
ticeship Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Rep-
resentative SUSAN DAVIS, for her lead-
ership on this bill, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume 
Mr. Speaker, others have spoken to 
this bill being a gift to the unions this 
afternoon. It is no surprise that the 
Democrats want to pay favor to the 
union bosses who line their pockets. 
Their end goal must be what all social-
ist countries have in common: control 
of the workforce through unions. After 
all, they have spent this Congress 
pushing one socialist agenda after an-
other. 
The bill before us is just another ex-
ample. Democrats’ blatant favoritism 
towards unions will block countless 
jobseekers from receiving apprentice-
ship opportunities. America’s workers 
and their families will pay the price. 
This bill reinforces the idea that there 
is only one way to do things—the gov-
ernment’s way. 
When will Democrats learn that the 
American people are not interested in 
government-mandated socialist poli-
cies? 
Once again, Democrats are choosing 
to bend to the will of Big Labor instead 
of putting American workers first. It is 
shameful, Mr. Speaker, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Virginia for 
yielding and for his leadership, and I 
thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for her leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise with great enthu-
siasm to support this outstanding leg-
islation which is H.R. 8294, the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act of 2020. 
Mr. Speaker, 250,000 Americans have 
died from COVID–19. Today 720,000 
Americans applied for unemployment 
insurance, and here we are today recog-
nizing the pain that America is experi-
encing, but more importantly giving an 
opportunity for young Americans and 
others to be part of a major apprentice-
ship program which invests more than 
$3.5 billion over 5 years in expanding 
opportunities and access to registered 
apprenticeship, youth apprenticeship, 
and preapprenticeship. 
I am glad to be an American. I am 
glad to be a union supporter, and one of 
the reasons is that I look over the 
landscape of my mother’s work and my 
father’s work, and I saw lives improve 
as unions gathered together to ensure 
that Americans could have a decent 
living, support their family, and pro-
vide opportunities for their children. 
Here we are today investing $3.5 bil-
lion, but the return will be $10.6 billion 
in net benefits to the United States 
taxpayers. I believe that that is a real 
darn good return. 
This legislation could not be more 
timely because of the record unemploy-
ment and because of the pain America 
is experiencing. This legislation also 
creates an additional 1 million new ap-
prenticeship opportunities. 
Let me tell you what I did before I 
flew up here to Washington. I visited 
Lone Star College—it hadn’t opened 
yet—at the Fallbrook campus. But 
they understood what apprenticeship is 
all about. They have a logistics appren-
ticeship that is going to be part of 
their educational system. That will 
give people the opportunity in this 
whole new business of online selling 
and buying. Yes, it is innovative. 
HCC apprenticeship program, Hous-
ton Community College, has electrical 
contractors, plumbers, masonry, iron-
workers, asbestos workers, glaziers, 
painters, and stationary engineers. Let 
me tell you the real picture that we see 
of this issue of helping with apprentice-
ship, Mr. Speaker. These are the faces 
from all over our city. 
And guess what? 
According to the Houston Chronicle: 
‘‘Interested in a new career? Consider 
an 
apprenticeship. 
Union-sponsored 
programs build skills, careers.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I include that article in 
the RECORD. 
[From the Houston Chronicle] 
INTERESTED IN A NEW CAREER? CONSIDER AN 
APPRENTICESHIP
UNION-SPONSORED
PRO-
GRAMS BUILD SKILLS, CAREERS. 
Houston Community College is restoring 
an old high school and converting it into col-
lege classrooms. And it’s using some of its 
own apprentices to do it. 
San Jacinto Senior High was built in 1960, 
and the community college is gutting it for 
new academic classrooms. The project start-
ed about a year ago, and is scheduled to be 
completed in October. 
The eight apprentices—six plumbers and 
two pipe fitters—are among the thousands of 
student workers in Houston who spend their 
days doing construction and their nights hit-
ting the books. Houston’s 11 union-sponsored 
programs, including the plumbers and the 
pipe fitters, last for five years; other pro-
grams, such as ironworkers and glaziers, last 
three years. 
But once the newly minted journeymen 
and women graduate, they should have great 
skills and—if the economy cooperates—a 
great career path. 
Chuck Fell, president of CFI Mechanical, 
which is installing the plumbing, heating 
and air conditioning in the new community 
college building, gave the group of appren-
tices a pep talk last week at the job site. 
‘‘You are learning skills,’’ Fell said to the 
plumbers and pipe fitters who are spending 
their days assembling and installing the 
massive piping systems and four hours a 
night, two nights a week in school learning 
their craft. 
Those skills can take you a long way, 
whether you opt to stay working in the craft 
or move up to foreman, superintendent or 
project manager, said Fell, who attributed 
his own success and that of nearly all of his 
project managers to their own apprentice-
ship training. 
‘‘You could be an owner of a company,’’ 
said Fell, who became a plumber/pipe fitter 
apprentice in Orlando, Fla., after graduating 
from college with a degree in architecture.

He went to work for a mechanical con-
tractor who suggested that to really learn 
the business, Fell needed to become an ap-
prentice. 
As part of that training, Fell spent two 
years at Walt Disney World’s Epcot Center 
installing the mechanical and plumbing sys-
tems. 
‘‘Set your sights high,’’ Doug Posey, direc-
tor of apprenticeship programs for Houston 
Community College, told the apprentices. 
‘‘The opportunities are just incredible to 
excel and to do great things.’’ 
Posey recalled how he put himself through 
college as a pipe fitter apprentice. He started 
his apprenticeship immediately after high 
school and eventually ended up with a degree 
in mechanical engineering from the Univer-
sity of Houston. 
While the concept of apprenticing yourself 
to a master craftsman and learning a trade 
is centuries old, it’s not exactly a well- 
known career path today. But two appren-
tices who are working on the CFI Mechanical 
project are glad they discovered the old-fash-
ioned way to learn a skill. 
Jaime Moncivais, a third-year apprentice, 
said he would never have heard about the 
program if it hadn’t been for his cousin and 
his uncle, who are foremen at the job site. He 
was working for a small company for two 
years before he left to join the program. 
Moncivais is 23 and earns about $43,000 a 
year, plus health insurance and retirement 
benefits, by working full time during the 
day. After work two nights a week, he at-
tends class for four hours. That costs him $88 
a semester. 
‘‘I’m enjoying it,’’ said Moncivais, who 
says he’s going to get his state plumbing li-
cense before he decides what’s next. 
So does his fellow apprentice Rudy Flores, 
who said he was drawn by the money. He es-
timates he earns about $50,000 a year. 
Flores, a fifth-year apprentice who has al-
ready received his state plumbing license, 
found out about the apprenticeship training 
program while working for a plumber in 
Houston who was also a former apprentice. 
He said he appreciates the intensive train-
ing of the program that sets him and the 
other apprentices apart. 
‘‘We like to see institutions put their 
money where their mouth is,’’ said Richard 
Shaw, secretary-treasurer of the Harris 
County AFL-CIO. ‘‘It sends a message that 
you ought to be training our students.’’ 
Shaw has been critical of school districts 
and other community colleges for not hiring 
their own graduates when the schools need 
construction work. 
Funding for the apprenticeship programs 
comes in part from the state of Texas. But 
the bulk of the money comes from contrac-
tors and union members. 
For example, members of the plumbers 
union as well as plumbing contractors each 
contribute 55 cents per work hour for the 
training program. 
HCC is the fiscal administrator of the 
union programs as well as the two nonunion 
programs that train building engineers and 
electrical workers. 
Calvin 
Speight, 
business 
manager 
of 
Plumbers Local Union No. 68, said he has 60 
apprentices starting in the fall and another 
30 the following semester. 
In the meantime, they’re working as 
‘‘provisionals’’ to see if they like the job. Ap-
prentices must be 18 years of age and either 
have graduated from high school or have a 
general-equivalency degree. 
Ms. JACKSON-LEE. Then I would 
like to emphasize real-life activity 
that comes about through the appren-
ticeship: HCC apprenticeship students 
help build a new hospital. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t think we are 
doing anything better today and this 
week by providing for $3.5 billion in ap-
prenticeship programs and $10.6 billion 
in return to the United States. I ask 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion and put Americans back to work. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, on the Budget, and as a cosponsor, 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 8294, the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act of 2020, which in-
vests more than $3.5 billion over 5 years in 
expanding opportunities and access to Reg-
istered Apprenticeships, youth apprentice-
ships, and pre-apprenticeships. 
I thank my colleague and good friend, Con-
gresswoman SUSAN DAVIS of California and 
Chairman BOBBY SCOTT for introducing this 
important legislation that has the potential to 
yield $10.6 billion in net benefits to U.S. tax-
payers in the form of increased workers’ pro-
ductivity and deceased spending on public-as-
sistance programs and unemployment insur-
ance and which bring America’s investments 
in apprenticeship more in line with countries 
around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, the Registered Apprenticeship 
(RAs) system is America’s most successful 
federally authorized workforce development 
program. 
According to the Department of Labor, 94 
percent of people who complete RAs are em-
ployed upon completion, earning an average 
starting wage of above $7,000 annually. 
Yet, according to the most recent data, only 
0.3 percent of the overall workforce in America 
have completed an apprenticeship. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation could not be 
more timely because during a time of record 
unemployment, the National Apprenticeship 
Act of 2020 invests more than $3.5 billion over 
5 years in expanding opportunities and access 
to Registered Apprenticeships, youth appren-
ticeships, and pre-apprenticeships. 
This legislation also creates an additional 1 
million new apprenticeship opportunities on 
top of the current expected growth of the ap-
prenticeship system, an investment that not 
only will pay off for workers and employers, 
but also benefit the taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is critical to ex-
panding the nation’s workforce development 
system during our country’s deepest economic 
downturn since the Great Depression. 
Specifically, the National Apprenticeship Act 
of 2020 Authorizes $400 million for fiscal year 
(FY) 2021, increasing $100 million annually to 
$800 million for FY 2025, to support the cre-
ation or expansion of registered apprentice-
ships, youth apprenticeships and pre-appren-
ticeships programs, including in non-traditional 
apprenticeship occupations and for nontradi-
tional populations. 
This funding will also attract and encourage 
employer participation and recruitment for indi-
viduals with barriers to employment, including 
individuals impacted by the criminal justice 
system. 
Additionally, to ensure that apprenticeship 
agreements and program registration to en-
sure consistency in quality standards and 
worker protections, H.R. 8294 codifies and 
streamlines standards for registered appren-
ticeships, youth apprenticeship and pre-ap-
prenticeship programs. 
Also, codified are the existing regulations 
and practices to ensure that all individuals 
have an equal opportunity to participate in pro-
grams under the national apprenticeship sys-
tem, and to increase diversity in the occupa-
tions offered and the individuals participating 
in programs, especially in high-skill, high- 
wage, and in-demand industry sectors and oc-
cupations. 
The legislation institutionalizes, and estab-
lishes by statute, the Department of Labor’s 
(DOL) Office of Apprenticeship, and vests it 
with the following roles and responsibilities: 
1. Increasing participation in programs 
under the national apprenticeship system 
through technical assistance and program rec-
ognition activities; 
2. Bringing together industry sector leaders 
and experts, including employers, industry as-
sociations, joint labor-management organiza-
tions, labor organizations, education and train-
ing providers, credential providers, and ap-
prentices to establish national frameworks to 
expand apprenticeships to new occupations 
and sectors; and 
3. Improving the data infrastructure to im-
prove reporting and publicly disseminating in-
formation about apprenticeship programs. 
Another strong feature of this legislation is 
that it codifies the roles and responsibilities of 
the State Apprenticeship Agencies (SAAs) by: 
1. Authorizing annual funding for State Ap-
prenticeship Offices and SAAs at $75 million 
for fiscal year (FY) 2021, increasing by $10 
million annually to reach $15 million for FY 
2025, with one-third of funds equally distrib-
uted to all States and outlying areas, and two- 
thirds of funds distributed via formula to SAAs; 
and 
2. Requiring SAAs to submit plans for reg-
istered apprenticeship activities, which gen-
erally mirror existing state requirements under 
the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
and the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical 
Education Act. 
My concluding reason for supporting this im-
portant legislation is that it strengthens the 
connections between the Department of Edu-
cation and Department of Labor through an 
interagency agreement to support the creation 
and expansion of youth apprenticeships, col-
lege consortiums, and data sharing agree-
ments. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for its pas-
sage. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, millions of workers will 
need reskilling due to pandemic-re-
lated job loss and displacement. 
The World Economic Forum dis-
cusses this issue at length in their re-
cent report titled: ‘‘The Future of Jobs 
Report 2020.’’ In the report they point 
to a double disruption scenario impact-
ing workers due to both automation 
and COVID–19 workplace disruptions. 
This double disruption is further rein-
forced in their findings that ‘‘84 per-
cent of employers are set to rapidly 
digitalize working processes.’’ 
The demand for reskilling workers is 
high, and we will be left chasing the 
needs of our workforce with the cur-
rent one-size-fits-all approach this bill 
seeks to enshrine into law. As in-de-
mand skills evolve in the years to 
come, the skills gap will continue to

grow in the absence of forward-think-
ing reform. 
I, again, urge my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to join Repub-
licans in creating new apprenticeship 
pathways through innovative models 
such as the industry recognized appren-
ticeship model. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
could you advise how much time is re-
maining on both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The gentleman from Vir-
ginia has 81⁄2 minutes remaining. The 
gentlewoman from North Carolina has 
3 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. 
SABLAN), who is the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Early Childhood, El-
ementary and Secondary Education. 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 8294. 
For 83 years, the National Appren-
ticeship Act has helped local econo-
mies grow by providing unprecedented 
career opportunities to young people. 
However, the National Apprenticeship 
Act has not supported apprenticeships 
in the Northern Mariana Islands and 
other insular areas. That inequity 
changes today. 
H.R. 8294 incorporates my bill, the 
Outlying Area Apprenticeship Expan-
sion Act, investing more than $11.2 mil-
lion over 5 years to create and expand 
apprenticeships to the insular areas. 
Our schools already provide students 
with the skills employers seek. But we 
need to build the connection between 
the classroom and real-world work. Ap-
prenticeships provide that link. 
I thank Congresswoman DAVIS and 
Chairman SCOTT for their leadership on 
apprenticeships and for working with 
me to include a technical fix to fully 
include the insular areas in the act. 
With widespread unemployment due to 
the coronavirus, we need to help people 
get to work. H.R. 8294 will help accom-
plish that goal. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 8294. I am going to 
miss Chairwoman SUSAN DAVIS as well. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, earlier we heard from our col-
leagues that there is going to be a $3 
return to the American people for 
every tax dollar they give up to get 
this program funded in the next 5 
years. I want to tell you that I think 
the American people would be happy to 
see that return. 
Show me any Federal program that 
returns to hardworking taxpayers $3 
for every dollar they pay in, and I will 
show you some swampland in New Mex-
ico. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN), 
who is a member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
offer my strong support for the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act of 2020. 
Especially I would like to commend 
the bill’s author, my friend, Represent-
ative SUSAN DAVIS. It is due to her 
steadfast and visionary leadership on 
the Higher Education and Workforce 
Development Subcommittee that we 
are here today advancing this impor-
tant and timely legislation. This bill is 
an apt capstone on her remarkable leg-
acy. 
Registered 
apprenticeships 
are 
a 
tried and true system for preparing our 
workforce for stable jobs that provide 
family sustaining wages and benefits. I 
have seen firsthand how unions have 
put this tool to excellent use over the 
years. In fact, just last year I visited 
the 
Laborers’ 
training 
facility 
in 
Hopkinton, 
Massachusetts, 
where 
young apprentices are training for ca-
reers in construction. The Laborers 
recognize the importance of this bill, 
which is why they have endorsed it and 
urged its passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter. 
LiUNA!, 
Washington, DC, November 18, 2020. 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: I write on behalf of 
the 500,000 hardworking men and women of 
the Laborers’ International Union of North 
America (LIUNA) to ask you to vote for H.R. 
8294, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2020, 
when it comes to the House floor for a vote 
this week. LIUNA is proud to support this 
important bill to keep our union apprentice-
ship programs strong. 
Registered Apprenticeship Programs, like 
the ones that LIUNA has had for decades, 
help workers earn while they learn. H.R. 8294 
invests more than $3.5 billion over five (5) 
years in expanding opportunities and access 
to Registered Apprenticeship Programs and 
Preapprenticeship Programs, among others. 
The bill creates nearly a million new appren-
ticeship opportunities on top of the current 
expected growth of the apprenticeship sys-
tem. It would also yield $10.6 billion in net 
benefits to U.S. taxpayers in the form of in-
creased workers productivity and decreased 
spending on public assistance programs and 
unemployment 
insurance. 
The 
rigorous 
standards in the bill ensure that the pro-
grams that apprentices will work in will be 
top-quality. 
At a time when our nation’s infrastructure 
needs are so great, H.R. 8294 will ensure that 
we continue to train the best workforce in 
the world. 
Again, I ask that you vote in favor of this 
important bill on the House floor. 
With kind regards, I am. 
Sincerely yours, 
TERRY O’SULLIVAN, 
General President. 
Mrs. TRAHAN. However, for far too 
long, apprenticeship opportunities have 
been utilized almost exclusively for 
just a handful of construction-oriented 
occupations. It is time to open this 
successful model to a wider range of ca-
reers and invite folks from a more di-
verse array of backgrounds to partici-
pate. This bill accomplishes both. 
I am particularly pleased it includes 
legislation 
that 
Representative 
MORELLE and I filed to assist small 
businesses in participating in reg-
istered apprenticeship programs and 
provide a particular focus on opportu-
nities for people of color, women, and 
veterans. 
At a time when college students are 
drowning in debt, we need to advance 
measures that offer more affordable 
pathways to the middle class. The bill 
before us will help countless people 
achieve the American Dream. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and 
Representative DAVIS for their excel-
lent work, and I urge the bill’s passage. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, actions speak louder 
than words. When it comes to Demo-
crats’ delivering on promises, Ameri-
cans are often left disappointed. Work-
force development and apprenticeships 
are no exception. Take their so-called 
Heroes Act as an example. 
Democrats tout the impactful role 
apprenticeships will play as our coun-
try recovers from the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Yet their bill allocates a min-
iscule percentage of money for work-
force development initiatives, and it 
doesn’t do anything to ensure the 
money is used to develop and educate 
workers. 
In the first Heroes Act only .07 per-
cent of total funding was allocated to 
the Employment and Training Admin-
istration. Unsurprisingly, in the Heroes 
Act 2.0, only 0.1 percent of total fund-
ing was allocated to the Employment 
and Training Administration. This is 
hypocrisy at its best. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH), who is a 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support H.R. 8294, the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act of 2020. 
We are in the midst of our country’s 
worst economic crisis in decades, and 
to better serve the American people, 
we must invest in our workforce and 
invest in the American Dream. 
Registered apprenticeships prepare 
people for the jobs of the 21st century, 
and with the evolution of technologies 
like 5G, Congress and the Department 
of Labor should be laser focused on en-
couraging and incentivizing appren-
ticeships for advanced wireless deploy-
ment. By supporting these programs, 
we can ensure that Georgia remains 
the best State in the country to live 
and to do business. 
For decades, the registered appren-
ticeship program has proven to be an 
entry into the middle class for many 
people. 
Congresswoman 
DAVIS’ 
Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act would sup-
port a successful workforce program at 
a time when our Nation needs it the 
most. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation.

Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, workforce programs 
like apprenticeships will aid in closing 
the skills gap and put more Americans 
to work, but only if employees and job 
creators are given the flexibility to in-
novate and develop high-quality earn- 
and-learn programs without overreach 
from Washington. 
That is why Republicans want to ex-
pand employers’ opportunities to ad-
dress the needs of their current and 
prospective workers through an all-of- 
the-above approach to apprenticeships 
rather than closing potential pathways 
to work. 
Unfortunately, 
H.R. 
8294 
doubles 
down on a narrow and prescriptive ap-
proach and gives Washington bureau-
crats, not job creators, more control. 
This flawed legislation will prevent 
more job seekers from accessing ap-
prenticeship opportunities. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in voting ‘‘no’’ on 
H.R. 8294, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, while I am disappointed 
that some of my Republican colleagues 
now appear to be opposed to some parts 
of the National Apprenticeship Act of 
2020, I still remain hopeful that we can 
come together to pass this critical leg-
islation. 
All of us agree that Congress must 
prioritize investing in apprenticeship 
opportunities. That is why the com-
mittee members on both sides of the 
aisle spent months working in good 
faith toward a bipartisan proposal. 
The tried-and-true registered appren-
ticeship programs funded in this bill 
provide valuable credentials that are 
nationally recognized. We have heard 
about the new, untried program, the 
IRAP, industry-recognized apprentice-
ship programs. Unfortunately, those 
programs do not create valuable cre-
dentials and are not nationally recog-
nized. 
Our work on this is even more impor-
tant now, considering the significant 
work we have to do because of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, as we often have a 
strong voice in support of apprentice-
ship programs, the National Appren-
ticeship Act of 2020 offers us a real op-
portunity to actually match our words 
with action. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that today we 
can set our politics aside and make the 
investment in registered apprentice-
ships, pre-apprenticeships, and youth 
apprenticeships 
that 
our 
economy 
needs and our workers deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. DAVIS) for 
her steadfast leadership on this legisla-
tion, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
letters from the United Association of 
Union Plumbers and Pipe Fitters, the 
National Electrical Contractors Asso-
ciation, and Third Way in support of 
the legislation. 
We write to urge the strong support and 
swift passage of H.R. 8294, the National Ap-
prenticeship Act of 2020. This bill would pro-
tect and expand union apprenticeship oppor-
tunities and codify the Office of Apprentice-
ship, helping to strengthen Registered Ap-
prenticeships and protect the more than 
359,000 men and women of the United Asso-
ciation of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters 
(UA), and union members everywhere, from 
unscrupulous contractors looking to cut cor-
ners. 
It is no secret that the safest, most highly- 
skilled, and most cost-effective workers 
come from Registered Apprenticeships like 
that of the United Association. We are im-
mensely proud of the robust investments— 
more than $275 million annually—that the 
UA makes in training and apprenticeship 
programs to ensure our members are the 
most highly-trained and most highly-skilled 
craftspeople in the world. On the jobsite, 
that translates to not only fewer accidents 
and injuries, but more projects of the highest 
standard completed on time and on budget. 
H.R. 8294 makes crucial changes to the 
Registered Apprenticeship program and sets 
firm standards for pre-apprenticeship pro-
grams, which have exponentially grown over 
the last several years; no longer can exploit-
ative contractors prop up pre-apprenticeship 
programs without having clear and defined 
pathways into a Registered Apprenticeship 
program. Further, H.R. 8294 adds statutory 
protections and enshrines the Office of Ap-
prenticeship into law, which will result in es-
tablished funding streams that ensure the 
necessary oversight of the program and ex-
pand technical assistance to help Registered 
Apprenticeship opportunities reach new sec-
tors. In addition, this bill strengthens the 
National Advisory Committee on Appren-
ticeship, meaning practitioners of Registered 
Apprenticeships in both industry and labor 
are given a voice to offer recommendations 
to further strengthen the program. 
Our members clearly understand the rami-
fications of any proposed changes to our ap-
prenticeship programs and standards. That is 
why this bill to reauthorize the National Ap-
prenticeship Act and codify protections and 
funding sources for Registered Apprentice-
ships is critical for our members. We urge 
you to support this bill and ensure that the 
Building Trades Registered Apprenticeships 
remain the Gold Standard of the construc-
tion industry. 
As always, feel free to reach out with any 
questions. The entire UA stands ready to as-
sist in any way possible.

brings power. light, and communication 
technology to communities across the U.S. I 
write to you in strong support of H.R. 8294, 
the ‘‘National Apprenticeship Act of 2020,’’ 
which would work to strengthen the time- 
tested apprenticeship model that has sus-
tained the level of excellence our contractors 
exhibit. 
For over 70 years, our electrical industry 
apprenticeship program, a joint labor/man-
agement venture between NECA and the 
International 
Brotherhood 
of 
Electrical 
Workers, has allowed participants the oppor-
tunity to learn a skilled trade in the elec-
trical industry while receiving fair wages, 
health care, and retirement benefits. With 
the combination of both on the job training 
(8,000 hours), classroom learning (900 hours), 
and remote virtual labs, our apprenticeship 
model offers the highest quality instruction 
at minimal cost to the apprentice or the 
Federal Government while producing the na-
tion’s finest electricians. 
Even with this model firmly in place, more 
must be done. As our nation continues to 
grapple with the effects of the ongoing pan-
demic, our contractors find themselves in 
continuous need of more skilled workers to 
help rebuild this nation. NECA believes this 
legislation is a step in the right direction to-
wards fulfilling this need. H.R. 8294 would 
work to bring greater funding to proven pro-
gram models, expand the standards approval 
process, and bridge the gaps between appren-
ticeship programs and the secondary/postsec-
ondary education system. 
We at NECA look forward to monitoring 
the floor debate on this topic and encourage 
your support for H.R. 8294, the ‘‘National Ap-
prenticeship Act of 2020.’’ Thank you for 
your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
MARCO A. GIAMBERARDINO, 
Vice President, 
Government and Public Affairs. 
THIRD WAY, 
Washington, DC, November 19, 2020. 
Hon. BOBBY SCOTT, 
House Committee on Education and Labor, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT: We are pleased to 
see that the National Apprenticeship Act of 
2020 is receiving a vote this week on the 
House floor. With millions of Americans out 
of work due to the COVID—0919 pandemic, it 
is vital that policymakers work toward an 
inclusive economic recovery. That’s why we 
encourage House lawmakers to pass the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act of 2020, which 
would provide a much-needed revamp of the 
nation’s registered apprenticeship system. 
Apprenticeships can play a key role in our 
economic recovery and help people regain 
their footing in the job market. 
Through your leadership, the National Ap-
prenticeship Act of 2020 would take impor-
tant steps to bolster apprenticeships across 
the country. It would broaden economic op-
portunity by expanding apprenticeships to 
women, people of color, and people facing 
barriers to employment. The legislation 
would help small and medium-sized busi-
nesses create apprenticeship programs. Fur-
ther, it would modernize our nation’s ap-
prenticeship system by expanding appren-
ticeships in growing fields like information 
technology, advanced manufacturing, and 
health care. 
The bill would also expand apprenticeships 
in part by relying on intermediaries, or ap-
prenticeship hubs, which would bring to-
gether 
employers, 
education 
providers, 
unions, and other organizations in each state 
that will work in concert to expand appren-
ticeships. This is an approach Third Way has 
long advocated for, and we’re thrilled that 
it’s a key part of this legislation. 
Through the National Apprenticeship Act 
of 2020, this country can promote apprentice-
ships as a key tool in our economic recovery 
and ensure everyone has pathways to in-de-
mand, good-paying careers. We thank you,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5977 
November 19, 2020 
Chairwoman Susan Davis, and House Edu-
cation and Labor Committee Democrats for 
their leadership on this legislation and urge 
Members to support it. 
Sincerely, 
GABRIEL HORWITZ, 
Senior Vice President, 
Third Way. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 8294, the National Apprenticeship 
Act. 
In my home state of Oregon and around the 
country, Registered Apprenticeships, pre-ap-
prenticeships, and youth apprenticeships are 
helping workers, particularly those with bar-
riers to employment, access meaningful em-
ployment. This is even more important at a 
time when hundreds of thousands of people 
are out of a job because of the economic con-
sequences of the coronavirus pandemic. Addi-
tionally, significant sectors of our economy are 
on the brink of transformation as the future of 
work evolves. 
Recently I held a virtual roundtable discus-
sion with apprentices, pre-apprentices, and 
union leaders from across Northwest Oregon. 
I heard from apprentices like Melissa who said 
that joining the Boilermakers Local 242 ap-
prenticeship was a ‘‘life-changing decision.’’ 
And Lacy who said, ‘‘I don’t know where I 
would be or what I would be doing’’ without 
her apprenticeship with Laborers Local 737, 
because it ‘‘made it possible to pay my bills 
and feed my kid.’’ By supporting the National 
Apprenticeship Act, we can strengthen invest-
ments in Registered Apprenticeships and help 
workers like Melissa and Lacy gain the skills 
and support services they need to be able to 
provide for themselves and their families. 
Last month, I visited with apprentices at 
IBEW Local 48 in Portland, Oregon. Through 
a partnership with the National Electrical Con-
tractors Association, IBEW’s electrical appren-
ticeship program demonstrates how our transi-
tion to a clean energy economy provides an 
extraordinary opportunity to create good-pay-
ing jobs. Earlier this year, I joined my col-
leagues on the Select Committee on the Cli-
mate Crisis in releasing a bold, comprehen-
sive, science-based Climate Action Plan, 
which emphasizes the need to reauthorize the 
National Apprenticeship Act as part of sup-
porting the increasing demand for skilled work-
ers in the clean energy sector. Efforts at the 
NECA/IBEW Local 48 Electrical Apprentice-
ship Training Program provide an excellent ex-
ample of the need to protect and strengthen 
our Registered Apprenticeship system. 
Industry partnerships can be one helpful tool 
in scaling up Registered Apprenticeships. For 
example, the Oregon Manufacturing Innova-
tion Center, or OMIC, is bringing together in-
dustry leaders with educational institutions 
such as Oregon Institute of Technology, Or-
egon State University, Portland State Univer-
sity, and Portland Community College to de-
velop a Registered Apprenticeship program in 
advanced manufacturing. My bipartisan Pro-
moting 
Apprenticeships 
through 
Regional 
Training Networks for Employers’ Required 
Skills Act is modeled on the efforts at OMIC 
to help small and medium sized businesses 
develop Registered Apprenticeships. The bill 
supports industry partnerships that bring to-
gether employers, education, training, labor, 
and community-based organizations to create 
paid, on-the-job training programs that meet 
the needs of employers and provide workers 
with important support services, like access to 
tools, work attire, transportation, child care, 
and mentorship support. I am grateful that 
Chair DAVIS incorporated many of our PART-
NERS Act provisions in the National Appren-
ticeship Act. 
Registered Apprenticeships provide mean-
ingful upskilling and reskilling opportunities 
and supportive services for displaced and dis-
located workers. I am pleased to be co-lead-
ing this important bill with Chair DAVIS to cre-
ate nearly one million new Registered Appren-
ticeship, 
youth 
apprenticeship, 
and 
preapprenticeship positions over the next five 
years. I thank Chairman SCOTT and Chair 
DAVIS for their leadership, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr Speaker, I rise in oppo-
sition to H.R. 8294, the National Apprentice-
ship Act. This bill, while well intentioned, fails 
to deliver on the goal of strengthening our reg-
istered apprenticeship system and expanding 
earn-and-learn opportunities for Americans 
across the nation. 
Our country’s workforce is facing a unique 
crisis, and we must ensure that our appren-
ticeship system is up to the task to meet the 
needs of our evolving workforce. For instance, 
the COVID–19 crisis has highlighted that 
connectivity and the digital world are an inte-
gral part of our daily lives. Developing a high- 
skilled workforce is critical as we seek to ex-
pand technologies like broadband and 5G to 
underserved areas across the country, includ-
ing my district in Michigan. 
Winning the global race to 5G will have a 
lasting economic benefit to the United States. 
In fact, 5G will create 3 million jobs and con-
tribute $500 billion to the U.S. economy over 
the next five years. However, as wireless tech-
nology evolves, the workforce needs to evolve 
along with it. Unless the U.S. has a large 
enough and properly trained workforce, we will 
not be able to fully reap the economic and 
technological benefits of 5G. 
Apprenticeships are a proven solution for 
meeting workforce needs, especially in wire-
less technologies. They provide the in-the-field 
experience and the necessary classroom in-
struction to build these advanced wireless net-
works. Congress and the Department of Labor 
should be laser focused on encouraging and 
incentivizing apprenticeship for 5G and ad-
vanced wireless deployment. Unfortunately, 
the bill we are considering would hinder the 
flexibility of employers to create earn-and- 
learn programs to teach job seekers the skills 
they need to build-out and deploy the 5G and 
wireless infrastructure America so desperately 
needs. 
For these reasons I must oppose H.R. 8294 
and urge my colleagues to work on a bipar-
tisan solution that will empower workers and 
employers to create apprenticeships that are 
responsive to our modern economy.

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
these amendments generally ensure ac-
cessibility for those with disabilities, 
increase equity, and increase opportu-
nities. They are not controversial, and 
I would hope they would be accepted. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition, though I 
am not opposed to the amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that 
Representative STEFANIK’s amendment 
was made in order. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she 
may consume to the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. STEFANIK). 
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member FOXX. 
Mr. Speaker, as our Nation recovers 
from the economic toll of the COVID 
pandemic and strives to restore the 
livelihood of America’s workers, we 
must 
take 
every 
opportunity 
to 
strengthen the pathways to meaning-
ful, family-sustaining careers. 
The apprenticeship model of pro-
viding paid work experience, coupled 
with classroom instruction and on-the- 
job mentorship, is a proven approach to 
equip workers with the skills they need 
for lifelong success. 
Individuals who complete high-qual-
ity apprenticeship programs imme-
diately enter into well-paying jobs and 
do so without the debt that often sad-
dles our younger generation of work-
ers. 
Despite this track record of success, 
apprenticeships remain the pathway to 
opportunity for far too few. Less than 3 
percent of the workforce comes up 
through the apprenticeship system, 
and the vast majority of registered ap-
prenticeship 
programs 
are 
con-
centrated in just a handful of indus-
tries. 
This stark reality leaves one of the 
strongest workforce development strat-
egies vastly underutilized in devel-
oping talent for the modern economy. 
In order to achieve our common goal of 
expanding apprenticeships to a more 
expansive set of occupations, we must 
develop a system that is responsive to 
the demands of the 21st century work-
place and accessible to employers in 
emerging industry sectors. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment offers a 
simple step in the right direction: re-
moving a barrier for employers who 
seek more freedom to design a program 
that fits their unique needs. 
For the nontraditional occupations 
and sectors, the mandated minimum of 
2,000 hours of on-the-job learning may 
not fit the nature of the job and thus 
prevent interested employers from ever 
developing an apprenticeship program. 
While H.R. 8294 provides a process for 
these employers to pursue an alter-
native time-based model that fits their 
industry, the legislation requires ap-
proval from both the State registration 
agency and the Secretary of Labor. 
A State apprenticeship agency seek-
ing to foster the growth of apprentice-
ships in their State could grant ap-
proval to an innovative model only to 
have these efforts stifled by Depart-
ment officials in Washington. The bu-
reaucratic nature of this process may 
discourage employers from even at-
tempting to use this flexibility in the 
first place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5979 
November 19, 2020 
My amendment removes the Depart-
ment of Labor from the process and 
leaves it solely at the discretion of 
States to approve alternative program 
models, empowering workforce leaders 
across the country to inject needed dy-
namism in the age-old system. 
Yet, this amendment alone cannot 
atone for the countless missed opportu-
nities to incorporate additional Repub-
lican amendments, amendments that 
would have allowed innovation to 
thrive while still upholding the safety 
and accountability standards necessary 
to underpin the taxpayers’ investment 
in apprenticeship programs. 
Revitalizing economic opportunity 
for America’s workers and small busi-
nesses will require a robust pipeline of 
earn-and-learn models that can serve 
an ever more diverse group of job seek-
ers, and I believe more work must be 
done before this legislation can truly 
fulfill that promise. 
Mr. Speaker, as we stand here in the 
final weeks of the 116th Congress and 
recognize that we will be back at this 
issue next year, I wholeheartedly be-
lieve that we can reestablish the bipar-
tisan spirit that has been a hallmark of 
our efforts on workforce development. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. DAVIS) for 
her passion and commitment on this 
important issue and for her leadership 
on the Higher Education and Work-
force 
Investment 
Subcommittee 
as 
well as her leadership on the House 
Armed Services. I serve with Mrs. 
DAVIS on two committees. She will be 
deeply missed. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Nevada (Mr. HORSFORD), who ac-
tually ran a program in Nevada to in-
crease job skills. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT from Virginia 
for his kind words and leadership, and 
I want to commend Congresswoman 
SUSAN DAVIS from California for lead-
ing on this important issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 8294, the National Apprentice-
ship Act, and to urge my colleagues to 
support my amendment, which would 
ensure equity and fairness in our na-
tional apprenticeship system. 
Specifically, my amendment would 
support the recruitment, retention, 
and completion of nontraditional ap-
prenticeship 
populations, 
including 
women, people of color, and individuals 
with barriers to employment. 
Now more than ever, in response to 
the 
economic 
challenges 
posed 
by 
COVID–19, people need access to oppor-
tunities in apprenticeships. This is es-
pecially 
true 
for 
my 
constituents 
throughout Nevada, which has been 
one of the hardest hit economic regions 
in the country. 
My amendment would ensure that 
women like Evelyn Pacheco, who is the 
founder 
and 
president 
of 
Nevada 
Women in Trades, continue to have op-
portunities to provide apprenticeships 
to women of color throughout southern 
Nevada. The opportunities presented 
by women like Evelyn matter because 
94 percent of apprentices who complete 
an apprenticeship program retain em-
ployment with an average annual sal-
ary of $70,000. 
Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that this 
pandemic has disproportionately im-
pacted workers of color, particularly 
women of color, who have shouldered 
the greatest job losses due to their con-
centration in low-wage service indus-
tries that have been hardest hit by the 
economic downturn. 
That is why we must do everything 
in our power to ensure that we have eq-
uity and fairness in our national ap-
prenticeship system so that every per-
son can have access and support for 
desperately needed job training. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote in favor of my amend-
ment, and I support the passage of H.R. 
8294. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD a letter from the 
National Urban League supporting my 
amendment and the National Appren-
ticeship Act of 2020. 
NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE, 
November 19, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
National Urban League and its 90 affiliates 
located in 36 states and the District of Co-
lumbia, I urge you to vote ‘‘Yes’’ on the Na-
tional Registered Apprenticeship Act (NAA) 
and associated equity amendments, includ-
ing those put forth by Representatives 
Brown, Horsford, Moore, Ryan/Rice and 
Smith/Langevin. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has shuttered 
businesses all across America, leaving mil-
lions of workers unemployed and devasting 
our national economy. Research shows that 
Black and Latino workers are more likely to 
be working in hard-hit industries that may 
never bounce back. The NAA represents an 
important step towards stemming that job 
loss by creating one million new apprentice-
ship opportunities over the next five years, 
in addition to the opportunities that are al-
ready being created. These apprenticeships 
result in substantially higher earnings com-
pared to nonparticipants. By some accounts, 
the average starting salary of an apprentice 
is $70,000, a family-sustaining middle-class 
income. 
Yet, more work is needed to ensure equi-
table access to apprenticeship opportunities 
to nontraditional populations, including peo-
ple of color and women, as apprenticeship 
programs are often less diverse than the oc-
cupations they ultimately serve. According 
to the Department of Labor’s (DOL) Equal 
Employment 
Opportunity 
study, 
African 
Americans represented only 10% of reg-
istered apprentices and are the most under-
paid compared to other ethnic groups. Across 
25 states in which DOL tracks registered ap-
prenticeships, the data show the opportuni-
ties are dominated by white men. 
The National Urban League has worked to 
advance economic opportunity for African 
Americans and other underserved commu-
nities for more than 110 years. Our job train-
ing programs target workers with multiple 
barriers to employment to help them secure 
full-time jobs and career advancement op-
portunities. Through DOL’s Equity in Ap-
prenticeship program, the National Urban 
League and eleven affiliates have increased 
opportunities 
in 
nontraditional 
fields 
through pre-apprenticeship and registered 
apprenticeships to more than 1,200 African 
American and other nontraditional popu-
lations. 
The National Urban League urges you to 
support the National Registered Apprentice-
ship Act and accompanying equity amend-
ments to ensure nontraditional populations 
have access to the support they need to 
thrive and businesses have the skilled work-
force they need to succeed in this uncertain 
economy. 
Sincerely, 
MARC H. MORIAL, 
President and CEO, 
National Urban League. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, 
Representative 
STEFANIK’s 
amendment is a valuable change that 
would make it easier for programs of 
shorter length to be approved specifi-
cally in fields where apprenticeships 
have not traditionally seen growth or 
expansion. 
While most of the other amendments 
in this en bloc are unobjectionable, I do 
want to highlight three amendments 
where I have concerns. 
The amendment offered by Rep-
resentatives BEYER
and PRESSLEY
is 
mostly unobjectionable. We certainly 
share the majority’s intent in ensuring 
access to apprenticeships for people 
with disabilities. However, it also in-
cludes a provision that would actually 
hold apprenticeship program sponsors 
to a higher standard than the standard 
to which section 508 of the Rehabilita-
tion Act of 1973 currently holds Federal 
agencies, which are the target of that 
particular provision. 
While this was likely well inten-
tioned, the underlying bill already pro-
hibits discrimination on the basis of 
disability and requires program spon-
sors to provide accommodations for in-
dividuals with disabilities, so holding 
small business and other employers 
who are seeking to expand opportuni-
ties for individuals with disabilities to 
a higher standard than we hold our-
selves in the Federal Government is a 
guaranteed way to ensure fewer ap-
prenticeship opportunities rather than 
more. 
b 1630 
Another amendment concealed with-
in the en bloc is offered by Representa-
tive MOORE, which will lead to exces-
sive paperwork and little real out-
comes for low-income individuals or in-
dividuals with barriers to employment. 
Finally, the amendment offered by 
Representative HORSFORD claims to en-
sure equity and opportunity in the ap-
prenticeship system. In reality, I am 
afraid it may cause confusion at best. 
The amendment would add new criteria 
to the definition of ‘‘national qualified 
intermediaries,’’ 
requiring 
them 
to 
support the increased participation of 
nontraditional 
apprenticeship 
popu-
lations and nontraditional apprentice-
ship industries or occupations. 
Even if they wanted to, some na-
tional qualified intermediaries may 
not be in a position to do this, either 
because of their location or the nature 
of their program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5980 
November 19, 2020 
If there is an opportunity in the new 
Congress to resume bipartisan con-
versations on reauthorization of the 
National Apprenticeship Act, I wel-
come the chance to discuss what the 
intent is here and to seek out common 
ground. In fact, I hope the new Con-
gress brings about true bipartisan work 
from my colleagues. 
While these three specific amend-
ments cause me concern, on balance, 
this en bloc consideration is worthy of 
support even if it won’t ultimately re-
deem the underlying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. BEYER), the chair of the 
Joint Economic Committee. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment with Rep-
resentative AYANNA
PRESSLEY. This 
amendment works to ensure that peo-
ple with disabilities are able to access 
registered apprenticeships on an equal 
basis with their nondisabled peers. 
Three cogent facts: The workforce 
participation rate for people with dis-
abilities is still less than one-third 
that of nondisabled peers; number two, 
among people with disabilities actively 
seeking work, the unemployment rate 
is twice that of nondisabled workers; 
and number three, people with disabil-
ities are less likely to have meaningful 
access to participate in apprenticeship 
programs. 
This amendment ensures that indi-
viduals with disabilities will be able to 
access apprenticeship programs that 
will help them develop the skills and 
build a work history that will open 
doors to their future. 
This can also help employers under-
stand the value of this workforce and 
learn from experience that accommo-
dating a disabled employee is usually a 
simple, inexpensive process that bene-
fits the employee, the employer, and, 
ultimately, all of us who benefit from 
having an engaged and diverse work-
force. 
I thank Representative SUSAN DAVIS 
for this bill and the leadership of our 
chairman, BOBBY SCOTT. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
as I indicated—and several have spoken 
on their amendments—I would hope 
that we would adopt the amendment en 
bloc, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that 
we aren’t here debating a bloc of 
amendments that will work to address 
the failings of the underlying bill. 
I am pleased to see at least one 
amendment in this group will help 
bring some flexibility to States. 
I urge support of the en bloc consid-
eration of these amendments, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 8294, the National Apprentice-
ship Act of 2020. 
The programs being addressed in this bill 
support on the job training, mentoring, and 
other assistance to help individuals gain em-
ployment and build careers in high paying 
and/or high skilled occupations. Registered 
Apprenticeships are our nation’s most suc-
cessful federal workforce training program. Ac-
cording to the DOL, 94 percent apprentices 
are employed after completing a Registered 
Apprenticeship and earn an average starting 
wage of $70,000. That success is to be ap-
plauded. 
Yet, this powerful tool can be improved. Just 
consider these two facts: Registered Appren-
ticeships only account for 0.3 percent of our 
workforce and nearly two-thirds of active ap-
prentices are employed in just one industry, 
construction. It’s long past time we bring these 
federal efforts into the 21st Century and ex-
panding access to apprenticeship opportuni-
ties is now especially important as we work to 
build back our economy from the lasting ef-
fects of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Key provisions to me in this bill are the calls 
to strengthen equity and promote equal oppor-
tunity to participate in youth apprenticeships, 
pre-apprenticeships, and apprenticeships, es-
pecially for nontraditional apprenticeship popu-
lations. Who are they? These are individuals 
who have traditionally faced barriers to ac-
cessing these opportunities, including low-in-
come individuals, those with disabilities, foster 
youth and former foster youth, and the for-
merly incarcerated, among others. 
I don’t have to tell you that low-income 
workers frequently face barriers . . . as do 
those who were previously or recently incar-
cerated. But we might remind ourselves ‘‘[a] 
history of incarceration does not disqualify a 
person’s skills, initiative, or humanity.’’ Thanks 
to Chairman SCOTT and the sponsor of this 
legislation, Chairwoman SUSAN DAVIS, among 
others for their efforts that have resulted in the 
legislation before us today. 
It recognizes that we need to keep working 
to ensure equal opportunity for all to partici-
pate in these programs. Pre-apprenticeships 
and apprenticeships are key gateways to po-
tentially good paying careers. It’s critical that 
we work to ensure that populations that have 
barriers to entry into these programs and are 
underrepresented. Inclusive workforce devel-
opment practices will help us achieve a more 
diverse workforce that leverages each individ-
ual’s talents, skills and abilities to determine 
their success, rather than the barriers they 
may face. 
My amendment, which is included in this en 
bloc, builds on the base bill to ensure we do 
not forget populations that have traditionally 
been underrepresented in these programs. 
This includes requiring regular reviews by the 
federal government of participation by non-
traditional populations in these programs and 
assessing how these programs increase par-
ticipation of these populations, especially in 
occupations where we know that their involve-
ment is underrepresented. My amendment 
would also ensure that federal coordination 
among a host of programs serving low-income 
individuals helps to promote their participation 
in the efforts supported by this bill. 
It is estimated that the efforts in this bill 
could create nearly 1 million new apprentice-
ship opportunities in addition to expected 
growth in the apprenticeship system. But it’s 
not enough just to increase the number of op-
portunities. We must expand access to the op-
portunities. 
Truly expanding access to these opportuni-
ties for all, including women, minorities, and 
other underrepresented and nontraditional 
populations, will benefit not only the workers 
who we connect to stable, good-paying jobs 
but also their communities. 
I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc 
and the underlying bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5981 
November 19, 2020 
The amendment offered by Mr. KIL-
MER
of 
Washington 
and 
Mr. 
FITZPATRICK of Pennsylvania amends 
the grant program within the under-
lying bill to promote offerings for com-
puter science programs. 
Modernizing the 80-year-old National 
Apprenticeship Act ought to include 
apprenticeship opportunities within a 
variety of sectors. Far too often, soci-
ety paints apprenticeships as only ap-
plying to the ‘‘trades.’’ While there are 
certainly valuable pathways within 
those fields, we need to expand the ho-
rizons of what apprenticeships are ca-
pable of providing for workers. This is 
also why I think it is important to call 
these ‘‘professions’’ rather than the 
‘‘trades.’’ A broader policy should not 
be limited by how it has traditionally 
been viewed or how we speak about it. 
Computer science is a high-growth 
and promising career path leading to 
in-demand lucrative jobs for workers. 
We hear too often that students are 
graduating without the technical skills 
they need to be successful in today’s 
workforce. This amendment would sup-
port employers in recruiting and devel-
oping new employees with the com-
puter science competencies they need 
to make up for these deficits and help 
fill a widening skills gap. 
Similarly, the amendment offered by 
Ms. TITUS of Nevada and cosponsored 
by several Members on both sides of 
the aisle adds hospitality and tourism 
to the list of nontraditional appren-
ticeship industries that are eligible for 
grants under this act. 
If this grant program is to live up to 
its name and reflect the economy of 
the 21st century, we must break free 
from antiquated, narrow ideas of ap-
prenticeships and bring more opportu-
nities to promising sectors. The hospi-
tality and tourism industries are a 
prime example of areas in which stu-
dents would benefit from more on-the- 
job learning experiences and employer- 
led instruction than they would from a 
traditional college education. 
Finally, the amendment offered by 
Mr. LAMB
of Pennsylvania and Mr. 
TAYLOR
of Texas includes veterans 
service organizations in several key 
places. Specifying VSOs as partner or-
ganizations for involvement in the reg-
istered apprenticeship system ensures 
the needs of veterans will be considered 
and incorporated into apprenticeship 
programs. 
The amendment also highlights the 
VSOs as entities that should be con-
tacted 
for 
promoting 
and 
raising 
awareness about apprenticeship oppor-
tunities, making sure our veterans 
have full access to and information 
about apprenticeship opportunities. 
Because 
apprenticeships 
recognize 
and build on prior knowledge and 
skills, veterans stand to benefit greatly 
from these opportunities and should be 
engaged in the system as much as pos-
sible. 
We want apprenticeships to support 
all workers seeking to access and en-
hance 
career 
opportunities. 
These 
amendments ensure the 21st Century 
Grant program expands opportunities 
in promising sectors and that the reg-
istered apprenticeship system engages 
veterans. 
I support these amendments, encour-
age my colleagues to do the same, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. KILMER). 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this package of en 
bloc amendments, which includes a bi-
partisan amendment I offered along 
with my good friend and colleague 
from 
Pennsylvania, 
Representative 
FITZPATRICK, to expand access to com-
puter science youth apprenticeship pro-
grams that are critical to the 21st cen-
tury workforce. 
We know education is the door to 
economic opportunities, and one of the 
most American and foundational paths 
to high-quality, work-based learning 
and education are apprenticeship pro-
grams. 
In today’s changing economy, it is 
important to continue to find ways to 
prepare our kids for the jobs of the fu-
ture: jobs in advanced manufacturing, 
healthcare, 
technology, 
green 
jobs, 
and, yes, computer science. 
According to Code.org, across 24 
States, only 35 percent of high schools 
in the U.S. teach computer science. 
That same study found that Black and 
Hispanic students, students receiving 
free and reduced lunch, and students 
from rural areas are less likely to at-
tend a school that provides access to 
this critical subject. 
Not everyone is going to have a tech- 
related job, but we know that there is 
a growing demand—a demand that we 
are struggling to meet—for students 
able to fill these in-demand jobs and 
for equipping workers with advanced 
computer science skills. 
To prepare students to be successful 
and innovative in the workforce, the 
Federal Government needs to expand 
computer science education and path-
ways to more students. That is why my 
amendment would ensure that com-
puter science youth apprenticeship, 
pre-apprenticeship, and apprenticeship 
programs are prioritized. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Washington (Mr. KIL-
MER). 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, it would 
provide priority for funding through 
this historic National Apprenticeship 
Act of 2020. 
Growing the number of computer 
science programs for students in high 
school and beyond will provide more 
21st century job opportunities for our 
kids, more high-skilled and qualified 
employees for our employers, and more 
economic resiliency for our commu-
nities. 
I thank the chairman for his support 
of this simple, yet important, amend-
ment. I thank Representative SUSAN 
DAVIS from California for her leader-
ship on this issue, and I encourage my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this pack-
age and ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB). 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, for the last 
21⁄2 years, I have been a member of the 
House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs; 
and during that time, one of the things 
I have seen is the way that our vet-
erans service organizations, particu-
larly the American Legion, the VFW, 
the Vietnam Veterans of America, but 
several others, too, play an essential 
role in connecting all of the good 
things that we are trying to do with 
government programs with the people 
who actually need to benefit from them 
and take advantage of them. 
So often in government, we have a 
hard time getting our ideas and our so-
lutions beyond the walls of the Federal 
office building and into the commu-
nities and streets and homes where we 
want them to be, and these organiza-
tions are very, very good at doing that. 
So I want to thank my colleague, Re-
publican Representative VAN TAYLOR 
from Texas, for partnering with me on 
these amendments to bring in these 
veterans service organizations as part 
of signing people up and enrolling them 
in apprenticeship programs so that the 
veterans who are out there who are 
most in need of up-skilling or creating 
a new career path can actually find out 
about these opportunities and take ad-
vantage of them. 
There is probably no one in America 
more qualified and a better bet for this 
investment than a veteran. On-the-job 
training is what we do. These people 
have the patience and discipline to 
complete these programs and make our 
entire workforce stronger and better 
off, and I know that the veterans serv-
ice organizations will help us get there. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from the Northern Mariana Islands 
(Mr. SABLAN). 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, the Titus 
amendment is simple. It includes hos-
pitality and tourism as an eligible in-
dustry for expansion of registered ap-
prenticeship opportunities. 
The hospitality and tourism industry 
is a major source for the Marianas. The 
GAO’s February 2020 report on Eco-
nomic and Workforce Trends in the 
Marianas found that hospitality and 
tourism account for 45 percent of GDP. 
We are not unique. The industry is 
critical to many communities across 
the Nation, but it is considered a non-
traditional industry for apprentice-
ships and has been unable to take full 
advantage of the apprenticeship sys-
tem. The Titus amendment fixes that. 
As I stated earlier, for 83 years, the 
National 
Apprenticeship 
Act 
has 
helped local economies grow by pro-
viding career opportunities to young 
people. The Titus amendment guaran-
tees that H.R. 8294 will build on that

I also am grateful that the ranking 
member is supportive of the Titus 
amendment. I thank everyone for their 
consideration, and I wish everyone a 
happy Thanksgiving, a Merry Christ-

Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the American Hotel and 
Lodging Association. 
AMERICAN HOTEL & LODGING 
ASSOCIATION, 
November 18, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: On behalf of the American Hotel & 
Lodging Association (AHLA), the sole na-
tional association representing all segments 
of the U.S. lodging industry, including iconic 
global brands, hotel owners and franchisees, 
lodging 
real 
estate 
investment 
trusts 
(REITs), hotel management companies, inde-
pendent properties, bed and breakfasts, state 
hotel associations, and industry suppliers, I 
write in support of H.R. 8294, National Ap-
prenticeship Act of 2020. This important leg-
islation would expand the national appren-
ticeship system to include nontraditional ap-
prenticeship industries and create a grant 
program to support registered apprentice-
ship, pre-apprenticeship, and youth appren-
ticeship programs. AHLA also strongly sup-
ports the bipartisan amendment offered by 
Representatives Dina Titus (NV–1) and Gus 
Bilirakis (FL–12) that would specifically 
identify the hospitality and tourism indus-
tries as a nontraditional apprenticeship in-
dustry under Sec. 201 of the Act. 
Prior to the pandemic, filling service posi-
tions was one of the hospitality industry’s 
most significant challenges. According to 
the Department of Labor (DOL), it was esti-
mated that nearly one million job vacancies 
remained unfilled. In order to meet the needs 
of the industry, AHLA and the AHLA Foun-
dation, the charitable giving arm of the asso-
ciation, are developing innovative programs 
that invest in our workforce and are de-
signed to open opportunities for underprivi-
leged 
communities, 
build 
careers, 
and 
strengthen the lodging industry. The Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act of 2020 would en-
able our Foundation to achieve this mission 
through grant programs specifically targeted 
to our industry. Additionally, the legislation 
updates the National Apprenticeship Act to 
provide the flexibility we need to reflect 
modem practices while maintaining the high 
standards set forth by DOL. 
On behalf of the more than 33,000 small 
business hotels, which represents over half of 
hotels in the country, and the millions of as-
sociates they employ, I urge the House of 
Representatives to swiftly pass H.R. 8294 and 
provide nontraditional apprenticeship indus-
tries, like the hospitality and tourism sec-
tors, an avenue to continue to grow our 
workforce and support our communities. 
Thank you for your consideration of this 
critical matter. 
Sincerely, 
BRIAN CRAWFORD, 
Executive Vice President, 
Government Affairs.

TRIBUTE TO MARK ANTHONY 
BROWN 
(Ms. SLOTKIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember a lifelong servant 
of the Lansing community, Mr. Mark 
Anthony Brown, who passed away No-
vember 9. I had the honor of knowing 
him and to have learned much from 
him. 
Born and raised in Lansing, and de-
voted to Lansing until his final days, 
he lived with relentless desire to im-
prove himself and those around him. 
He was an integral part of many Lan-
sing organizations, from the local 
branch of the NAACP to the Mayor’s 
Diversity Inclusion Advisory Board. In 
every endeavor, he was dedicated to 
making sure that underrepresented 
voices were heard when decisions were 
made. 
Mr. Brown was a man who was loved 
deeply. Guided by faith, with his fam-
ily as his north star, he never stopped 
working for his community. Above all, 
Mr. Brown believed in the power of 
genuine connections across race, creed, 
background, and belief. He was a uni-
fier who brought people together to 
better Lansing, and I will be forever 
grateful to him. 
Today, I am thinking of those closest 
to him: His mother, his brothers and 
sisters, his aunts and uncles, and his 
four children. 
I speak these words today so that his 
legacy is forever remembered in the 
permanent RECORD
of the people’s 
House, letting all who read it know: 
Mark Brown made a difference. 
f 
HONORING LESTER SHOFF 
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor an amazing constituent 
and patriot from the Central Coast of 
California, Lester Shoff. 
Raised in Pennsylvania, Lester was 
drafted into the Army in 1941. In fact, 
his draft number in the lottery was 
lucky number 1. Making the rank of 
staff sergeant, Lester was sent to the 
South Pacific and faced many of the 
challenges of serving in World War II. 
He fought for 4 years on close to 10 is-
lands in the Pacific, during which time 
he turned down a battlefield commis-
sion to become an officer. He was shot 
in the back by a sniper, and he was 
even stung by a scorpion. 
Although Lester was the recipient of 
the Purple Heart and Bronze Star, his 
daughter, Kay, told us that he never 
liked discussing the war because, when 
he did, the unemotional Lester would 
be brought to tears by the memory of 
two men who died on a mission that he 
led. 
After serving, Lester moved to Sil-
icon Valley, where he worked for Lock-
heed and developed glue for the Space 
Shuttle. He then retired to the Central 
Coast with his family. 
Madam Speaker, some say Lester was 
lucky; I say that we are all lucky to 
call Lester an American. 
f 
ADDING COUNTIES TO THE SOUTH-
WEST BORDER REGIONAL COM-
MISSION 
(Mr. COX of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. 
COX 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill 
that would add the counties in my Con-
gressional 
District—Fresno, 
Kern, 
Kings, and Tulare—to the Southwest 
Border Regional Commission. 
Modeled after the Appalachian Re-
gional Commission, the Southwest Bor-
der Regional Commission, or SBRC, 
was established to promote economic 
growth to help distressed regions that 
have historically been left behind at-
tain socioeconomic parity with the rest 
of the Nation. 
The Central Valley is one such region 
plagued by economic disparities, yet it 
is not part of any Federal regional 
commission. This must change. That is 
why I am here. 
My district continues to be in deep 
need of economic development and 
Federal investment. Unemployment in 
the region is consistently higher, and 
education 
attainment 
consistently 
lower than any other region in Cali-
fornia. 
The need for more Federal invest-
ment is critical now more than ever be-
cause of the COVID–19 pandemic and 
recession. Adding these counties and 
funding the SBRC will jump-start com-
munities and small businesses, helping 
America ‘‘Build Back Better’’ while 
generating new economic opportunities 
for hardworking people who are wait-
ing for their chance of achieving the 
America Dream.

STAY SAFE FROM COVID–19 DUR-
ING THE THANKSGIVING HOLI-
DAY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
one of the major leaders in the fight 
against COVID–19, Dr. Osterholm, said 
a few days ago that, if we continue on 
this same path, there will be 1,400 per-
sons a day that may die of COVID–19. 
This is a season that we gather to-
gether as family members and, as well, 
a season of joy. But I believe it is im-
portant for those of us who hold the 
reins of government, as we have been 
doing in this Congress under the lead-
ership of Speaker PELOSI: One, to fight 
without ceasing to pass the Heroes Act 
legislation for dollars for our local cit-
ies and counties and States, for test-
ing, for PPEs, and, of course, our busi-
nesses and restaurants. 
Before I left Houston this week, I did 
a press conference to call upon my 
local authorities to issue a public safe-
ty alert. It was done in California, and 
out of that came 30,000 people to be 
tested. This weekend, I am calling for a 
citywide challenge for people to be 
tested before Thanksgiving. 
I ask my colleagues to join me at the 
testing sites that are available because 
we must save lives. Wash your hands, 
where a mask, socially distance; but, 
on Thanksgiving, ensure that you are 
outside and in groups of less than 10 
people. 
Houston, do the testing regimen. 
Join us at the Allen Parkway Village. 
Get tested and save lives and stop com-
munity spread.

CONGRATULATING 
JOE 
MCHUGH 
ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM AM-
TRAK 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a native son of my 
community, 
Amtrak 
Vice-President 
Joe McHugh, from Allentown, Pennsyl-
vania, who is retiring after a storied 
career with our National Railroad Cor-
poration, which he has proudly served 
for 26 years. 
Joe served in various leadership roles 
for the railroad, and many here in the 
House of Representatives will remem-
ber him as one of Amtrak’s most effec-
tive advocates in its 50-year history. 
Joe helped lead Amtrak through an 
era of transformation and growth. He 
also has a unique firsthand under-
standing of the railroad. Over his 26 
years, he accomplished the rare feat of 
traveling over every mile of Amtrak’s 
more than 21,000-mile route network. 
Of his many accomplishments, the 
many people he mentored and whose 
careers he helped foster may well be 
his most important contribution to the 
railroad. 
The House of Representatives and the 
Nation owe Joe McHugh a debt of grat-
itude for his dedication and contribu-
tions. On behalf of the House of Rep-
resentatives and my community, I con-
gratulate him on his retirement and 
extend our very best wishes to him as 
he embarks on the next chapter in his 
life.

NEED FOR A COVID–19 RELIEF 
PACKAGE 
(Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, 
more than 245,000 Americans have al-
ready died due to COVID–19. Cases are 
surging to unprecedented levels. Mil-
lions are facing poverty, food insecu-
rity, and eviction. Low-income, home-
less, and minority communities have 
been hit especially hard and dispropor-
tionately. 
With the winter and holidays upon 
us, this wave threatens the health and 
economic well-being of our entire coun-
try. I am proud that we have already 
enacted four bipartisan economic relief 
packages that delivered targeted as-
sistance to those impacted by this pan-
demic. We need to do it again. We must 
act now during this Congress. 
Another relief package should in-
clude a robust national strategy for 
testing, tracing, and vaccination. Busi-
nesses, local governments, workers, 
and families need help to make ends 
meet. We must come together to de-
liver and help America with the urgent 
needs that it has and get this virus 
under control.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF VINCENT ‘‘PIKE’’ ANDERSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SLOTKIN). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. FLORES) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Vincent Anderson of Hewitt, Texas. Af-
fectionately known as Pike by his fam-
ily and friends, he passed away on Oc-
tober 7, 2020, following a courageous 
battle with cancer. 
Pike was born August 18, 1944, in Se-
dalia, Missouri, to John Kenneth An-
derson and Genevieve Katherine Collier 
Anderson. As a child, his family moved 
to Jackson, Mississippi, where he grad-
uated from Provine High School in 
1962. In 1967, Pike graduated from Mis-
sissippi State University, where he was 
a member of the Army ROTC program 
and the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. 
Following Army flight school, Pike 
deployed to Vietnam, where he flew 
AH–1G Cobra helicopter gunships for 
the Air Calvary. He was awarded the 
Distinguished Flying Cross in 1970 for 
his service in the A Shau Valley. In 
1973, he was promoted to captain, and 
later, honorably discharged at the con-
clusion of his active military service. 
In 1977, Pike went on to earn his mas-
ter’s degree from the University of 
South Alabama. Following graduation, 
they moved to Waco, Texas, where he 
accepted a job with the Veterans Ad-
ministration. After 23 years at the VA, 
Pike retired in March 2000 as the chief 
of kinesiotherapy. 
Pike served on active duty with the 
Texas National Guard during this time 
from March 1986 to August 2005, when 
he retired from the U.S. Army with the 
rank of chief warrant officer. Upon the 
second retirement, he worked with the 
Military Order of the Purple Heart as a 
National Service Officer assisting vet-
erans with VA claims at the Waco VA 
Regional Office. In 2008, he received the 
Kenneth Richardson Award as the Na-
tional Service Officer of the Year. 
Pike retired from service with the 
Order of the Purple Heart as the Re-
gion 5 Deputy Regional Field Super-
visor in 2015. He remained active with 
the local veterans community and 
served as a charter member, quarter-
master, and commander of VFW Post 
6008 in Hewitt, Texas. 
In addition to his many years of dedi-
cated military and veteran service, 
Pike Anderson served on the Hewitt 
City Council for 16 years, including two 
terms as mayor. 
b 1700 
He was instrumental in the develop-
ment of several transportation projects 
and the Veterans Memorial at Hewitt 
Park. 
Pike contributed a great deal of his 
time to his family as well as to the 
Episcopal Church of the Holy Spirit 
where he served on the vestry and be-
came a lay minister. Pike and Marcia, 
his wife of 52 years, were blessed with 
three beautiful daughters and nine 
grandchildren. He leaves behind a leg-
acy of service to his family, the com-
munity of Hewitt, and to our Nation. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Pike 
Anderson 
served his country proudly for many 
years, and his legacy will be forever 
woven into our American history. Pike 
was not only a public servant; he was a 
devout Christian and a committed fam-
ily man. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest 
and heartfelt condolences to the Ander-
son family. I have requested the United 
States flag be flown over the Nation’s 
Capitol to honor the life, legacy, and 
service of Pike Anderson. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue to pray for our country 
during these difficult times, pray for 
our veterans, pray for our military 
servicemen and -women, and pray for 
our first responders who keep us safe at 
home. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF JOE EARL 
WEST 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Mr. Joe Earl West of College Station, 
Texas, who passed away on 5 June 2020. 
Joe West was born on 8 March 1932 in 
Woodward, Texas, to Joe C. and Jozie

farm with four younger siblings; three 
brothers and a sister. At the age of 15 
his family moved to Cotulla, Texas, 
following the death of his younger 
brother, Robby. 
In high school, Joe quickly became 
enamored with Texas A&M University 
and decided he had to see it for himself. 
Setting out from Cotulla, Joe took a 
bus and arrived in College Station very 
late the next evening. Upon his arrival, 
Joe discovered that there were no va-
cancies at the local Aggieland Inn. But 
in an act characteristic of Aggie kind-
ness, the hotel clerk phoned A&M Vet-
erinary Medicine Professor, Dr. Hal 
Redmond and his wife, who graciously 
hosted Joe at their house that week-
end. 
Joe’s love for Texas A&M continued 
to grow after he enrolled, and he quick-
ly became an integral part of the Aggie 
community. By the conclusion of his 
undergraduate studies, he had partici-
pated in the Corps of Cadets, the Fish 
baseball team, and was elected to serve 
as Senior Yell leader his senior year. In 
1956, Joe graduated with his Doctor of 
Veterinary Medicine degree from Texas 
A&M School of Veterinary Medicine 
and was later commissioned into the 
U.S. Air Force Veterinary Corps. 
A lifelong learner, Joe earned his 
master’s in radiation biology from the 
University of Rochester before moving 
to California to pursue his Ph.D. in 
comparative pathology from UC Davis. 
While studying there at Davis, Joe met 
Carolyn Francis, a talented micro-
biologist; and it was love at first sight. 
Shortly after their wedding, Joe re-
ceived orders from the Air Force Vet-
erinary Corps to report to Washington, 
D.C. There he taught his passion, radi-
ation biology, to dentists, doctors, and 
veterinarians working on radiation ef-
fects, including those of space travel. 
After 22 years of dedicated service, 
Colonel West retired from the Air 
Force with many distinctions, includ-
ing 
the 
Air 
Force 
Commendation 
Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal 
with Oak Leaf Cluster, and the Legion 
of Merit. 
Joe also served the Texas A&M Uni-
versity system for 18 years. During 
that time, he served as president of the 
A&M Yell Leaders Association, as a 
faculty adviser to the Corps of Cadets 
where he was a speaker at the 2001 
Texas Aggie Muster Ceremony in Col-
lege Station. Some of Joe’s proudest 
accolades were being chosen as a Dis-
tinguished Alumnus of the A&M Col-
lege of Veterinary Medicine in 2001 and 
as a Distinguished Alumnus of Texas 
A&M University in 2011, the latter 
being the highest recognition that can 
be bestowed upon a Texas Aggie, and 
he was also inducted into the Texas 
Aggie Corps of Cadets Hall of Honor in 
2014. 
Professionally, Joe excelled within 
his chosen field of veterinary medicine. 
He was a delegate to the American Vet-
erinary Medical Association, the presi-
dent of the Texas Academy of Veteri-
nary Practice, and a highly regarded 
clinical pathologist at the Texas A&M 
Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Labora-
tory. 
Following retirement, Joe contrib-
uted a great deal of his time to his 
family and to the A&M United Meth-
odist Church in College Station. Joe 
was blessed with four children and 
three grandchildren with whom he en-
joyed spending time, sharing his love of 
Texas A&M, and teaching them all how 
to live by the Aggie Code of Honor. 
Madam Speaker, Joe served his coun-
try proudly for many years, and his 
legacy will be forever woven into our 
American history. Joe was not only a 
public servant, he was a proud Texas 
Aggie, a devout Christian, and com-
mitted family man. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest 
and heartfelt condolences to the West 
family. I have requested that the 
United States flag be flown over our 
Nation’s Capitol to honor the life, leg-
acy, and service of Joe Earl West. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country 
during these difficult times, for our 
military men and women who protect 
it, for our veterans, and for our first re-
sponders who keep us safe at home. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF WALLACE 
LEE EDGE, SR. 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Wallace Lee Edge, Sr. 
Wallace Lee Edge, known as Lee to 
his family and friends, was born 17 
March 1919 in Bryan, Texas, as the sev-
enth of nine children to George P. and 
Mae Harris Edge. 
Shortly after the attack on Pearl 
Harbor at the age of 21, Lee answered 
the call to service and enlisted in the 
United States Army. Upon completion 
of basic training, Lee was promoted to 
sergeant and was trained to lead an ar-
tillery battery. 
Lee participated in Operation Over-
lord, landing on Utah Beach along with 
thousands of other ‘‘Tough Ombres’’ 
serving in the famed 90th Infantry Di-
vision. 
Serving in the ‘‘A’’ battery of the 
343rd Field Artillery Battalion, Lee 
earned the affection and respect of the 
men he served with. As they made 
their way across France, Belgium, Lux-
embourg, 
Germany, 
and 
Czecho-
slovakia, Lee participated in some of 
the fiercest fighting in Europe, includ-
ing in the Battle of the Bulge. For his 
meritorious service in the war, Lee was 
awarded a Bronze Star and Bronze Ar-
rowhead. 
Upon returning from Europe, Lee em-
barked on various ventures before set-
tling down in Houston where he worked 
at Sears, Roebuck for almost 25 years. 
In August of 1961, while working at 
Sears, Lee met the love of his life, 
Francis Rudek. A month later he pro-
posed, and by November of that year, 
they were married. During their mar-
riage, they lived the American Dream, 
raising four boys and building a family 
in Houston, Texas. 
Nothing was more important to Lee 
than his family. On Independence Day 
of 1974, while on a family vacation to 
the Brazos River near Millican, Texas, 
their 11-year old son, Wally, began to 
struggle in the water. Lee dove in fully 
clothed to save him, however, he per-
ished in an unsuccessful attempt to 
save his first-born son. 
Lee Edge’s life was dedicated by serv-
ice to his God, his country, and his 
family. Lee is survived by his wife 
Francis, his sons, James, George, Ron, 
and three grandsons that would have 
been the pride of his life, Douglas, Mat-
thew, and James. 
Madam Speaker, Wallace Lee Edge, 
Sr. served his country proudly for 
many years, and his legacy will be for-
ever woven into our bright American 
history. Lee was not only committed 
to his country, but he was a man of 
faith who was wholeheartedly com-
mitted to his family and to his commu-
nity. 
I have requested that the United 
States flag be flown over our Nation’s 
Capitol to honor his life and his legacy. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country 
during these difficult times, for our 
veterans, for our military men and 
women who keep us safe, and for our 
first responders who keep us safe at 
home. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF LEE WAYNE 
RUSS 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Lee Wayne Russ, a courageous law en-
forcement officer who paid the ulti-
mate sacrifice in service to others. 
Twenty years ago, on 29 October 2000, 
he lost his life while protecting inno-
cent persons. 
Lee Wayne Russ was born on 19 June 
1952 in El Paso, Texas. The son of a po-
lice lieutenant and a registered nurse, 
he was instilled with the value of serv-
ice to others from a very early age. He 
began his career in law enforcement 
and joined the Ward County Sheriff’s 
Office in 1989. 
On that fateful day in October of 
2000, Deputy Russ was the first officer 
to respond to a domestic disturbance in 
progress at a home in Monahans, 
Texas. As he entered the home, he im-
mediately took action to disarm the 
suspect and protect the victim, Ms. 
Norma Sepulveda Esparza. 
In the struggle that ensued, Lee re-
ceived 
multiple 
stab 
wounds 
that 
would ultimately prove to be fatal. As 
the suspect resumed his attack on Ms. 
Sepulveda, Lee summoned his remain-
ing strength to retrieve his service re-
volver and fatally shot the attacker be-
fore succumbing to his own injuries. 
That day, domestic violence claimed 
the lives of two innocent people, Mr. 
Russ and the person he was protecting, 
resulting in six children losing a be-
loved parent. Any law enforcement of-
ficer will tell you that domestic dis-
turbances are among the most dan-
gerous situations for an officer to en-
counter. When the 911 call came across 
the radio, however, Lee did not hesi-
tate to put himself in harm’s way in 
service to another.

November 19, 2020 
A warrior and a protector up to his 
last breath, Lee’s final act was his val-
iant attempt to save the life of some-
one he had never even met. He truly 
exemplified the words of Jesus in John 
15:13, ‘‘Greater love hath no man than 
this, that he lay down his life for his 
friends.’’ 
Lee was surrounded by a community 
of friends where he was known for his 
kind and generous personality and his 
quick sense of humor. He had a reputa-
tion as an exceedingly fair and just 
peace officer who could diffuse tense 
situations. He took his oath to protect 
and serve seriously on and off duty, 
and he never turned down a request for 
help. 
Representative of his studious na-
ture, he knew the Texas Penal Code 
backwards and forwards, and he contin-
ually sought out additional opportuni-
ties to become a better peace officer 
through training and education. 
When people share stories of Lee, 
they often recall the small details that 
made him unique. He would not drive a 
patrol car without his signature beaded 
seat cover and a rope on the gear shift 
to fidget with. His regular trips to the 
library gave him a new stack of paper-
back novels, often 2- to 3-feet high, 
that he would quickly work through 
and then exchange them for others. He 
kept notepads next to his bed, his 
phone, and anywhere else he might 
suddenly feel the need to jot down a re-
minder or to write a note to a loved 
one. He distrusted computers and re-
sisted learning how to use one; until, 
that is, he found out he could play soli-
taire on one. 
Two decades later, his legacy lives 
on. Lee’s story is told in police acad-
emy training sessions to illustrate the 
power of the will to survive and how to 
fight for the protection of others. In 
recognition of his service and sacrifice, 
the Ward County Sheriff’s facility now 
bears his name. There, the Lee Russ 
Memorial Law Enforcement Center, in-
cludes a bronzed portrait of him where 
he watches over his brothers and sis-
ters in blue. 
Above all else, Lee should be remem-
bered for his love for his family. He was 
a beloved son, brother, uncle, and fa-
ther. Left to carry Lee’s legacy are his 
three children now grown, Jason Russ, 
Benjamin Russ, and Miranda Russ Hen-
derson. His two grandchildren, Barrett 
Russell Henderson and Madison Renee 
Henderson, will grow up with the les-
sons left from their Grandpa Russ and 
the stories of his humor, his bravery, 
and his kindness. 
Madam Speaker, Russ was a true 
American hero, a man of faith, and a 
dedicated family man. His life em-
bodied selfless service, and it serves as 
an example to us all. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest 
and heartfelt condolences to the Russ 
family on this unfortunate anniver-
sary, and I have requested the United 
States flag be flown over our Nation’s 
Capitol to honor the life, legacy, serv-
ice, and sacrifice of Lee Russ. 
As I close today, I ask all Americans 
to continue praying for our country 
during these difficult times, for our 
military men and women who protect 
it, and for our first responders who 
keep us safe at home. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF BILLY 
GIBSON 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Billy Brannon Gibson of Huntsville, 
Alabama, who passed away on 6 Octo-
ber 2020. Bill was born on 1 November 
1920 in Blount County, Alabama, to 
Laura and George W. Gibson. 
When World War II broke out, Billy 
wanted nothing more than to wear the 
Marine uniform and to join the fight 
against the Axis Powers. It would take 
Billy two attempts to become a Ma-
rine. His first try was in 1941; and at 6 
foot 3 inches tall, Billy was deemed too 
tall for his weight. He tried again 
about 2 years later, before which he ate 
a half-dozen bananas and drank a quart 
of buttermilk in order to gain more 
weight when he arrived at the recruit-
ing office. He also bent his knees as he 
was measured for his height, putting 
him at an even 6 feet. His efforts were 
successful, and they enlisted him in the 
Marine Corps at that time. 
Billy quit his job at the cotton mill, 
trained on 60-millimeter mortar equip-
ment, and then was qualified as a 
sharpshooter. He then headed out to 
the South Pacific. His first stop was 
Guadalcanal where his military career 
almost ended when he got hit in the 
head and shoulder by a military vehi-
cle. His right ear was dangling by a 
thread, and his shoulder was broken. 
His superiors wanted to send him 
home. He begged to go on to fight in 
Okinawa, but he kept being told he was 
not fit for combat. They ultimately 
agreed to let him go fight and fight he 
did. 
After his company landed on Oki-
nawa, he was part of the battle referred 
to as ‘‘82 days of hell and rain.’’ He 
does not recall being scared all the 
time, but he did say his worst scare 
came from a rat. Just before they had 
made it to the front line, he and two 
buddies stopped at a torn down house 
where they were going to sleep. During 
the night, a rat jumped out of the attic 
and hit him in the chest. He said that 
event was the closest he ever came to 
dying up to that point. 
b 1715 
Later during the fight, he almost 
drowned in his foxhole. A mortar round 
exploded less than 3 feet away from 
him, killing all five men around him. 
Billy once said that the greatest ad-
venture you can ever have is to go into 
mortal combat and beat the enemy. He 
is proud of what he and his fellow ma-
rines did on behalf of our country. 
At least one marine credits Billy 
with saving his life. He and Billy were 
behind a bluff trying to sneak up on a 
sniper in a cave. As his buddy was mov-
ing from behind one boulder to an-
other, he got shot in the chest. Billy 
caught him and called for the corps-
man to come tend to him. 
He did not see how his buddy would 
survive those injuries. Nonetheless, 
Billy got him to safety and went back 
to take out the sniper. 
Later, after the Marines had left Oki-
nawa, Billy received a letter from his 
injured marine buddy thanking him for 
saving his life. Billy said he never felt 
like a hero. He said he was just doing 
his job. 
Billy’s outfit, Company A of the 6th 
Marine Division’s First Battalion, 29th 
Regiment, suffered 300 percent casual-
ties. In other words, Company A was 
basically wiped out three times. Mirac-
ulously, Billy and four other marines 
were the only original company mem-
bers who were not killed or wounded. 
After serving our country, Billy met 
and married his wife, Alma Christine 
Gibson. They moved to Huntsville, Ala-
bama, and Billy went to work for 
NASA in the space and missile pro-
gram. He was awarded the prestigious 
Silver Snoopy Award for his work 
there. 
Billy enjoyed attending his church, 
fishing, and playing in a local bowling 
league, but his favorite pastime was 
golfing. 
His grandchildren say that he was 
their hero and that he was everything 
they dreamed a grandpa could be. 
Billy was striving to make it to his 
100th birthday, and, boy, did he get 
close. Unfortunately, he passed away 
just 26 days shy of achieving that mark 
and just 25 days shy of celebrating 73 
years with his beloved wife. 
Left to cherish his memory are his 
loving wife, Alma Christine Gibson; 
two sons, Gregory and Roger; two 
daughters, Cathy and Karen; seven 
grandchildren; 
and 
15 
great-grand-
children, 
four 
of 
which 
are 
my 
grandkids. 
Madam Speaker, Billy Gibson was a 
true American hero, a man of faith, 
and a member of America’s Greatest 
Generation. His life embodied selfless 
service, and he served as an example to 
all. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest 
condolences to the Gibson family. I 
have requested the United States flag 
be flown over our Nation’s Capitol to 
honor the life and service of Billy Gib-
son. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country 
during these difficult times, for our 
veterans, for our military servicemen 
and -women, and for our first respond-
ers who keep us safe at home. 
RECOGNIZING SIGNALMAN KENNETH GENE 
HAMILTON’S 94TH BIRTHDAY 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of the life of Navy 
Signalman Kenneth Gene Hamilton of 
Lamesa, Texas, who turned 94 on 5 No-
vember 2020. 
Kenneth was born in 1926 in Lamesa, 
Texas, to Marvin and Lona Hamilton. 
He has served a life of dedicated serv-
ice, including his enlistment in the 
United States Navy on his 17th birth-
day. Since he was not yet 18, Kenneth

was required to provide written paren-
tal permission in order to enlist. This 
selfless act was indicative of his pas-
sion and unwavering desire to serve his 
country. 
Shortly after enlisting, a troop train 
carried Kenneth to basic naval training 
at Camp Wallace in Galveston County, 
Texas. After boot camp, Kenneth was 
transferred to a base near the Chesa-
peake Bay to complete advanced indi-
vidual training as a signalman. Upon 
completion of this training, he received 
his ship assignment and traveled to 
San Francisco to join the rest of his 
crew. 
Kenneth was assigned to a Merchant 
Marine ship that had a contingent of 
naval personnel known as the ‘‘armed 
guard’’ on board. This group included 
weapons personnel and signal per-
sonnel. This ship provided logistic sup-
port to other vessels in the Pacific the-
ater and assisted in carrying ammuni-
tion. 
In 1946, Kenneth completed his enlist-
ment and, along with millions of other 
World War II veterans, he returned 
home to raise a family. 
Today, on behalf of a grateful Nation, 
we celebrate the life and accomplish-
ments of Signalman Kenneth Gene 
Hamilton in honor of his recent 94th 
birthday. 
Madam Speaker, Kenneth Hamilton 
has lived a long life filled with love, 
joy, and a passion for selfless service. I 
am proud to recognize him on this joy-
ous occasion, and I know that his fam-
ily and friends love him and are very 
proud of him. 
My wife, Gina, and I wish Kenneth 
many more years of health and happi-
ness and a happy birthday. We have re-
quested the United States flag be flown 
over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize 
Signalman Hamilton’s 94th birthday. 
As I close, I ask all Americans to 
continue praying for our country, for 
our military men and women, and for 
our first responders who keep us safe at 
home. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. PALAZZO). 
HONORING MRS. RUBY GREEN 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend and colleague, 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FLO-
RES), for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise to rec-
ognize the outstanding life of service to 
the community of Mrs. Ruby Thomp-
son Green. 
Mrs. Green, for the better half of her 
103 years on this Earth, exhibited true 
altruism and love for the city of Biloxi. 
She 
was 
born 
June 
5, 
1916, 
in 
Ahoskie, North Carolina. She earned 
her bachelor of science from Hampton 
University in Hampton, Virginia. Mrs. 
Green also spent some time studying at 
Atlanta University in Atlanta, Geor-
gia, before attending the University of 
Southern Mississippi. 
Mrs. Green married Mr. P. Irving 
Green on July 26, 1941, and they moved 
to Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1947. 
Mrs. Green founded and operated 
Green’s Kindergarten for 17 years, and 
she was the first African-American 
teacher at Biloxi High School. Mrs. 
Green also worked in the Star Program 
and worked as the assistant education 
director of the Head Start Program. 
Mrs. Green joined the New Bethel 
Baptist Church under the pastorship of 
Reverend E.H. Potter, and she served 
as a teacher of the intermediate class, 
superintendent of the Sunday school, 
director of the vacation Bible school, 
member of the senior mission, member 
of the kitchen committee, and member 
of the bus committee. She also served 
as assistant secretary of the Shiloh 
District of the Congress of Christian 
Workers. 
After retiring from her many years of 
dedication to her students at Biloxi 
High School, she volunteered at the 
Veterans Hospital in Gulfport, Mis-
sissippi. Along with her volunteer 
work, she was a member of the Cheer-
ios Homemakers Club and the Senior 
Citizen Group. 
Mrs. Green spent a great many years 
contributing to her community, and 
for many of her students and brothers 
and sisters in Christ, she was a strong 
pillar in the community. 
Of the 103 years, 11 months, and 23 
days that she spent with us, most of 
her time was spent bettering the lives 
of those around her. 
Mrs. Ruby Thompson Green was an 
outstanding citizen of the kingdom of 
God, the United States of America, 
Mississippi, and Biloxi, and her con-
tributions stand as a reminder to all of 
us that it is better to serve than to be 
served. 
It is my honor and privilege to recog-
nize the wonderful life of Mrs. Ruby 
Thompson Green. 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time.

VITAMIN D AND REDUCING COVID– 
19 MORTALITY RATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
this speech is being given kind of on 
short notice, a little earlier than I ex-
pected. But we don’t want to have the 
listening audience back home get any 
dead air, so I am rushing to give the 
talk. Hopefully, you will be satisfied, 
with not an excess of preparation. 
Today, I address something I don’t 
think 
has 
been 
addressed 
nearly 
enough with regard to the crisis of the 
COVID virus. In the last couple of 
weeks, we have gone over 250,000 deaths 
at least partially attributed to the 
coronavirus, and I want to talk about 
something we can do to decrease that 
number of deaths that I think has been 
far and away underpublicized, under-
publicized despite the fact that we have 
appropriated over $3 trillion to fighting 
this disease, underpublicized despite 
the fact that public health profes-
sionals are constantly being inter-
viewed on our news programs and are 
out and about on advertisements tell-
ing us what we can do to reduce the 
huge number of deaths attributed to 
this disease. 
One thing I want to do today is I am 
going to talk one more time about vi-
tamin D. I know some of the folks back 
home are familiar with vitamin D, but 
I don’t think the huge number of stud-
ies that recommend vitamin D have 
been publicized anywhere near enough. 
Right before I got here, I was talking 
to one of my constituents back home, a 
bright, well-informed person. He was 
surprised that vitamin D can be used to 
reduce the mortality rate from the 
COVID. 
I want to go over some of the things 
that have been determined about vita-
min D. We have had many universities 
doing studies. I mentioned all the way 
back in April and May, Trinity College 
in Dublin, Ireland, and Northwestern 
University down in Illinois have found 
studies showing a strong correlation 
between vitamin D deficiencies in pa-
tients leading to COVID complications 
and mortality. 
Those with adequate vitamin D levels 
were 
less 
likely 
to 
experience 
hyperinflammation within their lungs 
and less susceptible to severe COVID 
symptoms. 
Recently, in September, the Univer-
sity of Chicago Medicine and Univer-
sity of Boston Medicine, both con-
ducted research studies substantiating 
the preliminary evidence between the 
correlation between vitamin D defi-
ciencies and even getting COVID–19. 
Professors at Harvard have also pub-
lished articles highlighting vitamin D’s 
benefits for respiratory health and 
mentioning the connection between vi-
tamin D and COVID–19 as quite com-
pelling. 
European health professionals and 
right now the U.K., they have upped 
their recommendation for vitamin D 
among their citizens, something that it 
is high time our professionals were 
more aggressive in doing. 
In late October, as part of a study in 
the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology 
and Metabolism, researchers looked at 
216 COVID–19 patients in a hospital in 
Spain. Over 80 percent of the patients 
were deficient in vitamin D if they had 
severe COVID. Only 40 percent of the 
population as a whole had longer hos-
pital stays and higher inflammatory 
markers within their lungs. 
If you look at this, again and again 
and again, the researchers are talking 
about the correlation between ade-
quate levels of vitamin D and not hav-
ing as much mortality or serious 
things happening, and you wonder why 
our public health professionals and the 
CDC are not talking about this more, 
as they should. 
I know a couple of months ago, fi-
nally, Dr. Fauci talked about evidence 
of vitamin D’s benefits, after waiting 
months and months for it. He finally 
talked about it, but he only talked 
about it in some interview with a Hol-
lywood personality. He shouldn’t wait

November 19, 2020 
for a Hollywood personality asking 
questions to point out that he himself, 
as the most prominent member of our 
public health community, takes vita-
min D. 
How much vitamin D should you 
take? I have talked to different doc-
tors. 
By the way, I come to this conclusion 
not just by looking at the plethora of 
research studies done by colleges and 
universities around the world, but by 
talking to individual doctors. Right be-
fore coming up here, I talked to a doc-
tor from my district who routinely, 
every day, takes 5,000 international 
units of vitamin D. 
I will point out that is not the only 
way you can get vitamin D. You can 
get vitamin D from wonderful, healthy 
milk, and you can get vitamin D as 
well from interaction with the Sun. 
Sadly, 
during 
a 
lot 
of 
this 
coronavirus, people have been encour-
aged to stay inside rather than outside 
and getting the Sun, which would actu-
ally increase your vitamin D levels. 
I would ask Dr. Fauci, the CDC, the 
NIH, and public health professionals 
across the country: When you begin to 
tell people what you can do to save 
yourself or save your loved ones, make 
sure they are taking their vitamin D. 
b 1730 
There are obviously some commu-
nities more than other communities 
who are susceptible to vitamin D defi-
ciencies. People with darker skin are 
much more likely to be vitamin D defi-
cient; and, therefore, if you have dark-
er skin, pay special attention to the 
necessity of taking vitamin D. 
Again, it is not just for yourself. 
Make sure if you have any loved ones 
with cardiovascular problems, loved 
ones who may be a little overweight— 
I am a little overweight here, so I am 
not signaling anybody out, but if you 
are a little bit overweight, make sure 
you are taking that vitamin D. If you 
have got any diabetes, make sure you 
are taking that vitamin D. 
Actually, earlier today, I found out 
another acquaintance of mine from 
back in the district passed away from 
COVID, and it kind of bugs me that the 
vitamin D is not being stressed. 
A little while ago, I had the Surgeon 
General in my district. He rattled off 
five things to do. And they always talk 
about social distances. Fine. They al-
ways talk about masks. Fine. They al-
ways talk about wash your hands. 
Fine. But they don’t talk about vita-
min D, despite all of these studies. 
I don’t have an exact figure, but I 
would bet, if the entire American pub-
lic had adequate levels of vitamin D— 
and right now, about 40 percent of the 
American population does not have 
adequate levels—I would bet that the 
number of fatalities in this country 
would be decreased by at least a third. 
Like I said, none of these studies 
have an exact amount, but I think that 
could be that high. And if that is true, 
you are talking about maybe 80,000 
deaths if only the public health profes-
sionals would put taking vitamin D in 
the same talks they give you about a 
mask or social distancing or whatever. 
I am going to point out that it is 
more important than ever because we 
are going into the winter, and in win-
ter you get what? At least in Wis-
consin, you go outside less and you get 
less sun. And going outside less and 
getting less sun are both things that 
are going to accelerate the number of 
people who get the COVID, and get the 
COVID seriously. 
So now I will say it one more time to 
emphasize: It is a good time to make a 
list of all the older people or people 
with preexisting conditions and make 
sure they get vitamin D. 
Actually, as I am giving the talk up 
here, I would suggest for Thanks-
giving—or for Christmas, even—stop-
ping by one of our fine chains of drug-
stores and getting some vitamin D. 
You can, on your own, look on the 
internet and hear what they say about 
zinc. A lot of people say some zinc is 
good as well, supplementing it. It is 
something else you don’t hear the pro-
fessionals talk about a lot, but when I 
talk to doctors in their own right, talk 
to nurses in their own right, yes, grab 
some zinc as well. They talk about pa-
tients who are taking both vitamin D 
and zinc and how they have almost no 
patients who have had to be hospital-
ized for the COVID. 
So, in summary, I want to emphasize 
for the political geeks who tune in and 
watch this show: Make sure you are 
taking your vitamin D. Make sure you 
give vitamin D to older people who you 
know or people with preexisting condi-
tions. 
I especially emphasize to any public 
health professionals who are watching 
this little speech: Next time you are 
giving a talk on the radio station or if 
anybody is out there preparing the 
next set of commercials on how to deal 
with the COVID, emphasize the vita-
min D and familiarize yourself with the 
studies from Trinity College in Ireland, 
the Spanish studies, what has been said 
at Harvard, the studies at North-
western, and the studies at the Univer-
sity of Chicago and you will learn a lit-
tle bit more about things your occupa-
tion ought to be talking about. 
So that is all the time I have today, 
and thank you for allowing me to give 
this little speech. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair, not to a perceived 
viewing audience.

HONORING 
BERNIE 
STONE 
AS 
IOWAN, AND VETERAN, OF THE 
WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, Veterans Day 
offers Americans time each year to reflect on 
the service and sacrifices of our veterans, re-
minding us of the freedoms and values we 
might take for granted other days. This is the 
week for us to pay our respects to those who 
have served and stand united in respect for 
our veterans. That is why today, I rise to 
honor a veteran who is a shining example of 
what it means to serve both in uniform and in 
his community. I am proud to recognize Bernie 
Stone as Iowan of the Week. 
Bernie is the City Leader and Co-Founder of 
the Des Moines Chapter of Bunker Labs 
where he equips, mentors, and connects vet-
erans and military spouses with resources to 
get them on the path to a successful business. 
He loves to help people achieve their goals 
and strives to help veterans find meaning and 
purpose after service. Bunker Labs is a na-
tional network of veteran and military spouse 
entrepreneurs dedicated to helping the military 
connected community start their own busi-
ness. They are committed to seeing that every 
entrepreneur in the military-connected commu-
nity has the network, tools, and resources they 
need. 
Bernie moved to Des Moines in 2015 after 
a 20-year Army career that ended at the Pen-
tagon, where he served as a Russian affairs 
specialist. Throughout his military career Ber-
nie gained high-level experience in foreign af-
fairs and national security policy as well as ex-
tensive overseas experience in Europe, Cen-
tral Asia, and East Asia. He has served in five 
U.S. Embassies and was awarded the Medal 
of Merit from the Republic of Lithuania. 
Bernie served our nation with honor and dis-
tinction. When he retired from military service 
and began the transition back into civilian life, 
he was surprised and disappointed to discover 
how difficult it was to find meaningful employ-
ment that would put his skills to use. Veterans 
find themselves in this circumstance all too 
often after service. In the face of that chal-
lenge, Bernie dedicated his skills to Bunker 
Labs so other veterans could overcome the 
same obstacle. 
Organizations like Bunker Labs and advo-
cates for helping veterans gain meaningful 
employment and professional opportunity after 
military life show that our veterans have the 
grit, skills, and work ethic that can help any 
business grow and compete. It is important to 
thank veterans for their service and honor 
them with events and national observances, 
and even more important to help them find 
health, happiness, and success when they 
come home. I am committed to making sure 
our military families can reintegrate into civilian 
life, and I will continue to fight for legislation 
that ensures that our nation’s veterans are 
taken care of. 
I thank Bernie and all of our veterans who 
have dedicated their lives to serving this great 
nation. It is my honor to recognize him as 
Iowan of the Week.

TRIBUTE TO BERWIN HANNA 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to my good friend 
Berwin Hanna, who is stepping down this 
month from the Norco City Council. Norco, 
California, is known as Horsetown, USA be-
cause of its affection for horses, and few peo-
ple have embodied its spirit more than Berwin 
Hanna. 
As a native Texan, Berwin was raised 
around horses, cattle and livestock. Under the 
direction of his cowboy father, Berwin learned 
to tend cattle and train horses. Eventually, he 
would become an accomplished thoroughbred 
trainer and travel to racetracks from Michigan 
to New Mexico training horses. Berwin would 
later settle in Norco after being naturally 
drawn to the community because of its deep 
equestrian roots. 
First elected to the Norco City Council in 
2007, Berwin was motivated to serve and ad-
vocate for maintaining the city’s rural, animal- 
keeping lifestyle. After joining the council, he 
worked to embrace Horsetown, USA’s focus 
by developing more equestrian events and 
businesses. He was at the forefront of estab-
lishing the National Day of the Cowboy, which 
has quickly become one of the city’s most 
cherished events. Throughout his time on the 
council, Berwin represented the city on the 
Riverside County Transportation Commission, 
Northwest Mosquito & Vector Control District 
and Riverside Transit Agency. 
While Berwin will no longer be serving the 
city in an official capacity, I am confident he 
will continue to be a champion for Horsetown, 
USA into the future. I want to thank Berwin’s 
wife, Diane, as well as both of his daughters 
and son for supporting him while he served 
his community. I know I speak on behalf of all 
residents in expressing my heartfelt thanks 
and praise for Berwin’s significant contribu-
tions to the city of Norco.

RECOGNIZING COMMANDER 
CHRISTOPHER JOHN ARBUCKLE 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize those men and women 
who continue to serve this great Nation with 
honor—men such as Commander (CDR) John 
Arbuckle, United States Navy. 
For the past year, CDR Arbuckle served on 
my staff as a Congressional Defense Fellow. 
A 1998 graduate of the United States Naval 
Academy, CDR Arbuckle is a proud Naval Avi-
ator who has also earned his Juris Doctor 
from the University of Kentucky. During his as-
signment in my office, CDR Arbuckle provided 
senior-level input for defense, veterans, for-
eign affairs and intelligence matters. Addition-
ally, he executed his work as a liaison to the 
constituents of Virginia’s First Congressional 
District with distinction. 
Furthermore, CDR Arbuckle provided excep-
tional support to me as a staff liaison to the 
House Armed Services Committee in my role 
as the Seapower and Projection Forces Sub-
committee Ranking Member. CDR Arbuckle 
dutifully provided me with guidance on what 
the Navy’s path forward should be in critical 
areas such as training, readiness, and man-
ning. His recent command experience was in-
valuable to my work in Congress. 
As the Co-Chair of the Congressional Ship-
building Caucus and the Co-Chair of the 
Navy-Marine Corps Caucus, I relied on CDR 
Arbuckle to organize quarterly events with 
government, military, and private sector lead-
ers. These events allowed key decisionmakers 
to work together for the advancement of our 
future Naval Officers as well as the construc-
tion and repair of the ships on which they will 
serve. 
CDR Arbuckle also directly contributed to 
my goal of providing excellent constituent 
service to the people of the First District. He 
was responsible for bringing numerous con-
stituent inquiries to a successful conclusion, 
and he leveraged his personal and operational 
experience in the Navy to respond to the most 
challenging inquiries. In addition to his efforts 
locally, CDR Arbuckle took on projects with re-
gional, state, and national implications, dem-
onstrating his ability to view a challenge from 
many angles and develop innovative solutions. 
CDR Arbuckle’s work ethic, duty to mission, 
and commitment to servant leadership is with-
out equal. I believe that his personal drive to 
achieve excellence in his work has and will set 
a very high standard for his peers. I would 
also like to thank CDR Arbuckle for the serv-
ice and sacrifice he has made, and continues 
to make, both for our Nation and our great 
Navy. His impeccable integrity, boundless 
work ethic, and loyal devotion to duty earned 
him the respect and admiration of my staff and 
the First District of Virginia. I have no doubt 
that CDR Arbuckle will continue to serve the 
Navy honorably and with distinction. 
I wish John and his wife Allison, children 
Ella and Jack, the best of luck as they con-
tinue their journey together as a Navy family. 
It was an honor and a pleasure having John 
serve on my staff. We all can sleep soundly at 
night knowing that members of our all-volun-
teer force like John stand ready to defend our 
country and take the fight to our enemies; far 
away from their families and the comforts of 
the United States of America.

NATIONAL SEA GRANT COLLEGE 
PROGRAM AMENDMENTS ACT OF 
2020 
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, as Co-Chair 
of the House Oceans Caucus, I rise in support 
of S. 910, a bill to reauthorize and increase 
funding for the National Sea Grant College 
Program. 
The health of our ocean reflects the health 
of our planet. The Sea Grant program’s re-
search, extension, and education efforts are 
essential to improve our understanding, con-
servation, and use of our nation’s coastal re-
sources. Affiliated with Oregon State Univer-
sity (OSU) as one of the 33 university-based 
programs, Oregon Sea Grant focuses on the 
ecological, social, and economic effects of 
many coastal issues, including evaluating de-
velopment, adapting to coastal hazards, pro-
tecting marine fisheries, and understanding 
the cultural significance of marine resources. 
Oregon Sea Grant also fosters and in-
creases public understanding of ocean and 
coastal issues through its management of the 
Visitor Center at OSU’s Hatfield Marine 
Science Center in Newport, Oregon. The Cen-
ter is an ocean and coastal learning laboratory 
for all ages. Oregon Sea Grant extension staff 
are based in coastal communities and along 
the Columbia River to engage stakeholders on 
topics related to ocean health and coastal 
communities. As Co-Chair of the House 
Oceans Caucus, I have had the opportunity to 
work with the Sea Grant program and witness 
the value of their collaborative model to 
crafting meaningful solutions to the most sig-
nificant challenges facing our ocean today, like 
ocean acidification, harmful algal blooms, hy-
poxia, marine debris, and tsunami prepared-
ness. 
I am grateful to Oregon Sea Grant for their 
many efforts to protect and sustain coastal 
communities, and especially their work to 
strengthen the resiliency of our ocean and 
coastal ecosystems in Northwest Oregon. I 
urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.

HONORING JOAN HARDIE 
MUNFORD 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Joan Hardie Munford, who passed 
away on November 11, 2020. Mrs. Munford 
was a businesswoman and represented parts 
of the New River Valley in the Virginia House 
of Delegates, where she was a legislator of 
accomplishment. 
Joan Hardie was born on October 25, 1933, 
in Blacksburg, Virginia to John D. Hardie and 
Hester Price Hardie. Her family owned busi-
nesses including the popular Hardie House 
restaurant 
in 
the 
area. 
She 
attended 
Blacksburg High School, where she met her 
eventual husband Thomas William Munford 
Jr., and graduated in 1951. She then attended 
Radford College, now Radford University, and 
earned a degree in Education. 
Mrs. Munford embarked on a business ca-
reer, participating in the founding of a property 
and nursing home development corporation in 
the early 1970s. She worked as a licensed 
nursing home administrator for Heritage Hall in 
Blacksburg, and it became a chain with seven-
teen nursing homes across Virginia. She 
eventually rose to the position of Vice Presi-
dent of Operations. 
In 1981, Mrs. Munford was elected to the 
Virginia House of Delegates representing the 
Thirteenth District and become one of the few 
women in the General Assembly. In the 
House, she served on the Corporations, Insur-
ance, and Banking, Labor and Commerce, 
and Education Committees. She was an ac-
complished legislator involved in passing laws 
regarding education, child labor, and work-
place regulation among other topics. By the 
time she retired from the House of Delegates 
in 1993, she had risen to chair of the Labor 
and Commerce Committee. 
Retiring from the House of Delegates did 
not end Mrs. Munford’s community service, as 
she served on the Board of Directors for First 
National Bank of Christiansburg and the 
Carilion New River Valley Medical Center and 
as a member of the first planning committee 
for Virginia Tech’s Choices and Challenges 
Forum Series. She was an active member of 
Blacksburg Presbyterian Church and loved 
music, especially playing the piano, throughout 
her life. 
Mrs. Munford is survived by her daughter 
and son-in-law, Mary and David Harder; her 
grandsons, James Harder and Benjamin Hard-
er and his wife, Jacquelyn Harder; and great- 
grandchildren, Cole and Airlie Harder. I offer 
my condolences to them on the loss of this 
community servant and advocate.

IN HONOR OF PRECINCT 1 COMMIS-
SIONER 
MICHAEL 
‘‘MIKE’’ 
MEADOR 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Michael ‘‘Mike’’ Lloyd Meador for his 
honorable 28 years of public service as Pre-
cinct 1 Commissioner in Montgomery County. 
The Meador family roots in Montgomery 
County extend back over 100 years, and Mike 
has carried on the family legacy with his lead-
ership and integrity. Mike was born to W.L. 
and Poodle Meador in Willis, Texas, and grad-
uated from Willis High School. Staying near 
his roots, he went on to earn a degree in Ac-
counting from Sam Houston State University 
in Huntsville, Texas. 
Always a dedicated member of his commu-
nity, Mike has served as Montgomery County 
Commissioner of Precinct 1 since January of 
1993. In fact, in December of 2019, Mike was 
recognized as the longest-serving commis-
sioner in the history of the county. After 28 
years in service, Mike announced he will be 
stepping down from this position in January of 
2021. 
Mike’s time in public service has been as 
accomplished as it has been lengthy, and his 
exceptional management has helped attract 
commercial and industrial businesses to the 
precinct. Under Mike’s leadership, several suc-
cessful developments have been established; 
two community centers, multiple Justice of the 
Peace and Constable buildings, 17 baseball 
fields, and the acquisition of a grant to build a 
recycling center. Mike’s tenure has been de-
fined by honesty, integrity, and humility. He’s 
always prided himself on maintaining an open 
line of communication with constituents, and 
remained constantly engaged with those he 
serves. It’s no wonder he was named ‘‘Elected 
Official of the Year,’’ by the Lake Conroe Ro-
tary Club. 
Mike’s involvement in our community ex-
tends well beyond his role as commissioner— 
he is a member of First Baptist Church of 
Conroe, a lifetime member of both the Mont-
gomery County Fair Association and Friends 
of Conroe, a member of the Montgomery 
County Historical Society and an active partici-
pant in the Lake Conroe Chamber of Com-
merce. 
Mike’s commitment to his community is 
matched only by his commitment to his family. 
He and his wife of 50 years, Janie Houser 
Meador, have three children and nine wonder-
ful grandchildren. I join them all in thanking 
him for his exceptional service to Montgomery 
County. Our community has been blessed to 
have Mike, and I wish him all the best as he 
embarks on his next endeavor.

HONORING ERIC BURMEISTER 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Mr. Eric Burmeister, Executive 
Director of the Polk County Housing Trust 
Fund, as this week’s Iowan of the Week for 
the week of September 25, 2020. 
Iowans have been through a lot recently. 
Along with the COVID–19 pandemic, we have 
also experienced extreme drought, a derecho, 
and some communities are still recovering 
from last year’s floods. One common issue 
families are facing as the result of each of 
those circumstances is a rise in housing inse-
curity, whether by damage to the home itself 
or loss of income to pay for housing. For far 
too many in our state, this basic human need

is at risk. And if a basic need like housing isn’t 
met, parents will struggle to maintain steady 
employment and children will not learn as well 
in school. There is no facet of life untouched 
by this issue. 
Eric Burmeister and his team at the Polk 
County Housing Trust Fund (PCHTF) have 
been fighting tooth and nail to make sure our 
most vulnerable neighbors have somewhere 
stable to call home. Not only does the organi-
zation lead local efforts on planning, advo-
cating, and funding for affordable housing in 
the state’s most populous county, its team 
also finds meaningful ways to help individuals 
through housing challenges. 
Recently due to the COVID–19 pandemic, 
we’ve seen a dramatic increase in evictions in 
Polk County and across the state. To combat 
the issue, Burmeister, along with the PCHTF 
and Iowa Legal Aid, came up with a new pro-
gram to help renters avoid eviction. Imple-
mented nearly a month ago, the project is set 
up just outside Polk County’s eviction court to 
connect tenants with legal assistance and im-
mediate 
rental 
assistance. 
Funded 
by 
$800,000 from Polk County’s share of federal 
CARES Act funding, the emergency program 
provides low-barrier funding that can cover 
rent through the end of September and as far 
back as March 15. Burmeister’s goal for the 
program is to provide one more reinforcement 
in the safety net to help Polk County residents 
avoid homelessness during the pandemic. 
Since the program began Sept. 1, it’s already 
helped prevent 61 evictions affecting 149 resi-
dents, 77 of them children. 
Eric has been involved in affordable housing 
advocacy for decades. He came to the 
PCHTF in 2010 after a thirty-year career in 
real estate development and finance. A grad-
uate of Drake University Law School, he has 
represented developers of notable commercial 
and residential redevelopment projects in the 
Des Moines metro area, including the historic 
Kirkwood Hotel, Brown Camp Lofts, and the 
Newin Dairy Lofts. Burmeister also has a long 
history of involvement in the Des Moines com-
munity, serving in leadership positions with 
The Polk-Des Moines Taxpayers’ Association, 
The Greater Des Moines Leadership Institute, 
and most recently on the Executive Committee 
and Board of Trustees of Grand View Univer-
sity where he teaches part-time in the busi-
ness department. He stays active in several 
Des Moines neighborhood associations and is 
currently serving on steering committees as a 
community representative for affordable hous-
ing issues. 
Through his tireless dedication to address-
ing this issue and finding countless ways to 
get involved in his community, Eric shows us 
what it means to be an Iowan. Since before I 
took office, I’ve said the best problem solvers 
live right here in Iowa’s third congressional 
district. Eric’s sensible solution to help his 
neighbors avoid homelessness during a global 
pandemic is one more example of that fact. 
I’m forever proud of Iowans like him who have 
stepped up to the plate to help address this 
pressing issue. I will continue to promote and 
push for legislation in Congress that enables 
organizations like the Polk County Housing 
Trust Fund, Iowa Legal Aid, and advocates 
like Eric to work towards their goal of afford-
able housing and eradication of homeless-
ness. It is my privilege to recognize Eric 
Burmeister as Iowan of the Week. 
TRIBUTE TO RONALD W. 
SULLIVAN 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to and congratulate Director 
Ronald W. Sullivan for his nearly two decades 
of dedicated service to Eastern Municipal 
Water District (EMWD). 
Director Sullivan has been a Board Member 
at EMWD since January 2003, representing 
Division 4, which includes the cities of Menifee 
and Perris. During his tenure on the Board, Di-
rector Sullivan has dedicated himself to help-
ing EMWD advance projects that provide a 
more reliable water supply for future genera-
tions of customers in western Riverside Coun-
ty. He has helped EMWD secure hundreds of 
millions of dollars in local, state and federal 
funds that have expanded water, wastewater 
and recycled water infrastructure. He played a 
pivotal role in the advancement of EMWD’s 
groundwater desalination program, including 
the Perris II Desalter. Mr. Sullivan was also a 
driving force behind the completion of modern-
ized sewer systems in the economically dis-
advantaged communities of Quail Valley and 
Enchanted Heights; both projects were offset 
by significant external funding. 
Director Sullivan was passionate about ad-
dressing arid west issues. He served as a 
board member on the National Water Re-
sources Association, was a federal affairs liai-
son for the Association of California Water 
Agencies, and was honored by the Texas 
Water Conservation Association for his dedi-
cation to multi-state collaboration on federal 
issues with Texas. Mr. Sullivan was a tireless 
advocate in Washington, DC, providing testi-
mony before Congress and pushing federal 
agencies to partner with EMWD to address 
the needs of his constituents. 
Director Sullivan has served as EMWD’s 
representative to the Santa Ana Watershed 
Project Authority (SAWPA), which manages 
the Inland Empire Brine Line and other re-
gional watershed management programs as 
well as the Western Riverside Council of Gov-
ernments. He is a former Riverside County 
Planning Commissioner, and City of Hemet 
Planning Commissioner. 
Ron is a great American, a true public serv-
ant, and a friend. The entire Southern Cali-
fornia region, as well as the arid west, thank 
Ron for his many years of dedicated service 
and I wish him the best in his next chapter.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DAVID M. 
BARRON 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of David 
M. Barron, who passed away this month at the 
age of 79. Mr. Barron was a colleague of mine 
in Monterey Park, California, a longtime resi-
dent of California’s 27th Congressional Dis-
trict, and a dedicated public servant. 
Mr. Barron was born in East Los Angeles on 
September 29, 1941, and was the youngest of 
four siblings. He attended East Los Angeles 
College for several years and transferred to 
California State University, Los Angeles, 
where he would go on to receive his B.A. in 
Journalism and Communications in 1965. His 
passion for journalism led him to work as a 
writer and editor for the Belvedere Citizen and 
Eastside Journal for many years after college, 
and he would later go on to publish the Mon-
terey Park Journal and the West Valley Jour-
nal for over 20 years. 
Mr. Barron met his wife at East Los Angeles 
College and the two married in 1963. They 
moved to Monterey Park in 1966 where he 
began his long career in public service to the 
community. He served on the Monterey Park 
Planning Commission for several years before 
being elected Monterey Park City Clerk in 
1988, where I worked alongside him as a 
member of the City Council. Among his many 
accomplishments as City Clerk, Mr. Barron 
was 
credited 
with 
bringing 
electronic 
touchscreen voting to the city. He retired from 
his long career as City Clerk in 2013 after 25 
years in the role, but was dedicated to con-
tinue his service to the community. He then 
served for six years on the Board of Trustees 
for the Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library 
and was a member of the Monterey Park Li-
brary Foundation. 
Mr. Barron is survived by his beloved wife 
Mary Ellen, four children, 10 grandchildren, 
and two great-grandchildren. He leaves behind 
an enduring legacy of service to Monterey 
Park and the San Gabriel Valley, and it is my 
distinct honor to commemorate his life.

CONGRATULATING NED GOLD 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Ned Gold, of Warren, Ohio, who 
earlier this year was awarded the Boy Scouts 
of America’s highest honor, the Silver Buffalo 
Award. 
Mr. Gold, who has been in Scouting for 
more than 70 years, was one of 14 to be hon-
ored nationally this year. The Silver Buffalo 
Award is the distinguished service award of 
the Boy Scouts of America. It is awarded for 
extraordinary service to youth on a national 
level. 
Ned has spent countless hours contributing 
to the work of Scouting, including helping to 
found the Philmont Staff Association, which 
supports the Philmont Scout Ranch, the larg-
est youth camp in the world, located in Cim-
arron, New Mexico. 
Additionally, Ned is credited with bringing a 
450-piece fine art collection, which includes 65 
scouting-themed paintings by Norman Rock-
well, out of storage and on exhibit at the Med-
ici Museum of Art in my Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Outside of Scouting, Mr. Gold has greatly 
contributed to the Mahoning Valley commu-
nity. I am unaware of any other lawyer who 
devotes as much pro-bono time in our com-
munity as Ned. Through his dedicated work

IN HONOR OF THOMAS REED HAUN 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of a special man, Mr. Thomas 
Reed Haun. Mr. Haun is part of a special 
group of heroes that served our nation during 
World War II. He passed away on November 
14, 2020. 
Mr. Haun was born on July 27, 1924. He 
grew up in Sweetwater, Tennessee, where he 
lived until moving to Nicholasville, Kentucky 
for his final years. On August 3, 1943, he en-
tered service in the United States Army. He 
served in the United States Army’s 34th Divi-
sion, 168th Infantry Regiment, under the com-
mand of Lt. Gen. Mark W. Clark. Mr. Haun 
earned the rank of Staff Sergeant and served 
in the European-African-Middle Eastern The-
ater. He was wounded in the Po Valley in 
northern Italy on September 29, 1944. He was 
shot 9 times, from shoulder to ankle. Mr. Haun 
was hospitalized for a year, first in Italy, then 
transported on a hospital ship to New York 
and then Florida. He was given an experi-
mental drug called penicillin. Mr. Haun was 
honorably discharged on July 2, 1945. For his 
brave service to our country, he was awarded 
the Purple Heart, the Silver Star, and the 
Bronze Star. 
Upon returning from military service, Mr. 
Haun married Betty Ruth Ramey on October 
6, 1946. They were married for 67 years. He 
worked as a manager at Sweetwater Hosiery 
Mill and then as a Deputy Clerk in the General 
Sessions Court. He served the people of 
Sweetwater and Monroe County on the City 
Commission, as a Trustee for 32 years, and 
as Fire Department Commissioner. He was a 
lifelong member of First Baptist Church. Mr. 
Haun was a loving husband, father, grand-
father, and great-grandfather. 
Mr. Haun and his fellow veterans are true 
heroes. As members of the ‘‘Greatest Genera-
tion’’, they willingly served and sacrificed to 
protect and defend the freedoms that we enjoy 
today. I am humbled to honor the service of 
Mr. Thomas Reed Haun before the United 
States Congress.

TRIBUTE TO MIKE R. VASQUEZ 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to an outstanding in-
dividual, Mike R. Vasquez, who passed away 
at the age of 82 on October 27, 2020. As a 
restaurant entrepreneur and philanthropist, 
Mike was a dedicated and integral member of 
the Corona community who will be deeply 
missed. 
Mike was born in Phoenix, Arizona on Sep-
tember 8, 1938, and was later raised in San 
Bernardino, California. Known to close friends 
as Mickey and Don Miguel, Mike met his wife 
Mary Sanchez during a trip to Mexico. In 
1973, Mike and Mary moved to Corona and 
bought an existing restaurant that they re- 
opened as the first Miguel’s full-service res-
taurant serving Mary’s family recipes. Just two 
years later, the couple expanded the family 
business by opening their first fast food res-
taurant, Miguel’s Jr. Over the decades since 
then, the Vasquez family has expanded the 
chain to more than 20 restaurants throughout 
southern California. The City of Corona, and 
its residents, are extremely proud to be home 
to the original Miguel’s restaurants and they 
are second to none in the quality of food and 
service. 
As a hard-working small business owner, 
Mike became increasingly active in his com-
munity throughout his life. He was incredibly 
generous to both his employees as well as 
causes and organizations throughout our re-
gion. In recognition for their significant con-
tributions, Mike and Mary were selected as 
Citizens of the Year in 2009 by the Corona 
Chamber of Commerce. 
As a fellow Corona resident and small busi-
ness owner, I had the pleasure of knowing 
Mike and his family and I can personally attest 
to his numerous achievements and the count-
less lives he touched. He was a great Amer-
ican, a leader in our community, and a dedi-
cated husband, father, and friend. I extend my 
heartfelt condolences to his wife, Mary, to their 
children, Eva, Danny, Michael, Carol, Sylvia, 
and Javier; and 14 grandchildren. Although 
Mike may no longer be with us, he will con-
tinue to have a lasting impact on the lives of 
his family and community.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
THE 
HONORABLE 
PHILIP 
RAN-
DOLPH LEE, M.D. 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a highly distinguished American, Dr. 
Philip Randolph Lee, who was born in Palo 
Alto, California, and died in New York City on 
October 27, 2020, at the age of 96. 
Dr. Philip Lee was the son of Dorothy 
Womack Lee and Peter Van Arsdale Lee, a 
physician who founded what is today, the Palo 
Alto Medical Foundation. Dr. Lee, his three 
brothers and sister followed in their father’s 
footsteps, all becoming highly regarded physi-
cians. His nephew Peter Lee, serves as the 
distinguished and highly effective Executive 
Director of California’s health benefit ex-
change, 
Covered 
California. 
Medicine, 
healthcare and public service run deep in the 
Lee family. 
Dr. Lee received his undergraduate and 
medical degrees at Stanford University. He 
earned fellowships at the Mayo Clinic and 
New York University; and a Masters of 
Science degree from the University of Min-
nesota. He was a professor at both Stanford 
and UCSF, and he served our country on ac-
tive duty and as a member of the United 
States Naval Reserve from 1943 to 1951, in-
cluding during the Inchon Invasion in Korea.

November 19, 2020 
Dr. Lee served our nation as Director of 
Health Services in the Office of Technical Co-
operation and Research, part of the Depart-
ment of State’s Agency for International Devel-
opment, from 1963 to 1965. He was a strong 
advocate for Medicare, and for this he was 
vilified by the AMA and others as a socialist. 
He served as Assistant Secretary for Health 
and Scientific Affairs in the U.S. Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare from 1965 to 
1969. During this time, he worked directly with 
President Johnson and helped implement the 
newly passed Medicare program, integrating 
many of the hospitals in our country as man-
dated by the Medicare legislation. 
From 1969 to 1972, Dr. Lee was UCSF’s 
third Chancellor, and founded what became 
the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy 
Studies. He worked closely with UCSF’s Black 
Caucus to end unequal pay and other dis-
criminatory practices. 
Dr. Lee was Chairman of the Physician Pay-
ment Review Commission in Congress from 
1986 to 1993 and then served in the Clinton 
administration as Assistant Secretary for 
Health in the Department of Health and 
Human Services, from 1993 to 1997. 
Dr. Lee had a profound impact on our coun-
try and its healthcare system. He was a friend 
and beloved mentor to me and hundreds of 
others, and a wise and compassionate man. 
He had a sharp wit, a great laugh, and always 
a twinkle in his bright blue eyes. He will be 
missed by everyone who had the good fortune 
to know him, and he will be honored for gen-
erations to come for the enormous influence 
he had on the delivery of medicine in the 
United States. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the life 
and work of Philip Randolph Lee, and in ex-
tending our condolences to his wife, Dr. Roz 
Diane Lasker, and his entire family. He was as 
humble as he was extraordinary. He made us 
a better and stronger nation and his life and 
work will sustain us and inspire us for genera-
tions to come. 
HONORING SOPHIE HOMONOFF AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Sophie Homonoff, Director of 
Education at the Jewish Federation of Greater 
Des Moines, as our Iowan of the Week for the 
week of October 2, 2020. 
Sophie is a mother, a lifelong teacher, and 
loves working with children. Originally from 
Des Moines, Sophie once attended the 
schools she now leads. When she and her 
family moved back to the area in 2012, she 
dedicated herself to volunteering at the Fed-
eration and eventually became its leader on 
their educational efforts. She recognized what 
a Jewish education had given to her as a kid 
and wanted to give that experience to others. 
Like most educators, Sophie juggles an in-
credible amount at work. She oversees Gan 
Shalom Preschool which serves young chil-
dren from local Jewish and non-Jewish fami-
lies five days per week. She runs the religious 
school, Beit Sefer Shalom, for pre-kinder-
garten through 12th grade students. Sophie’s 
team also offers two summer camps—one for 
little kids and one catered to school-aged chil-
dren—so they have somewhere fun, safe, and 
engaging to spend time outside the classroom. 
Through their collective efforts, Sophie and 
her team serve more than 200 children each 
year. 
In addition to schools and camps, Sophie di-
rects several programs to help young Iowans 
further grow in their faith and foster greater 
understanding in the community. Nearly eight 
years ago she launched the Madrichim pro-
gram, a teenage leadership opportunity for 7th 
through 12th graders to serve as paid student 
aids, which grew to two dozen participants last 
year. Madrichim gain a stronger sense of iden-
tity and responsibility, learn as they teach and 
mentor younger children and those with spe-
cial needs, and deepen ties within their con-
gregation. 
A more recent addition is the Student-to- 
Student pilot project, where high school stu-
dents from the Federation visit another high 
school, middle school, or religious institution 
classroom to educate others about Judaism in 
a 45-minute session. With same-aged peers 
speaking to one another about their experi-
ences and asking questions in a safe environ-
ment, Sophie has found the program to in-
crease knowledge and awareness while de-
creasing stereotypes and prejudice. She and 
her students are working on a video version of 
the program with Zoom Q&A so it may con-
tinue during the pandemic and expand to 
schools outside of central Iowa. 
This year COVID–19 has presented one sig-
nificant challenge after another for families 
and schools. Sophie has guided her team 
through various adaptations in recent months 
so classroom and extracurricular activities can 
continue in a safe, effective manner for as 
many students as possible. They started sum-
mer camp online and eventually transitioned 
the entire program outdoors, rotating partici-
pants so kids could gather and play safely. 
For students engaged in online learning while 
their parents are at work, the Federation’s 
education staff welcomed them to the facility 
to help them through the school day. They 
provide snacks, lunches, and care from teach-
ers to navigate virtual education. When they 
get breaks the students can play outside and 
see friends, so they don’t feel as isolated. 
Sophie’s team also added an online compo-
nent to the religious school to make sure no 
children fell behind. They’re providing families 
balance and security when so much feels un-
certain. 
I greatly admire people like Sophie who in-
vest so thoughtfully in our children and our 
communities. Her leadership and hard work 
are creating strong ties across Des Moines 
during a time when we all must work together 
to build a more tolerant, inclusive, and empa-
thetic future for all our neighbors. If you ask 
her what her focus is, Sophie will tell you it’s 
to follow the Federation’s mission of sup-
porting and connecting the community and to 
make sure everyone is taken care of. You can 
see that focus in everything she does. Those 
who know Sophie say she doesn’t receive 
nearly enough recognition for all the hard work 
she puts in to make the community stronger. 
It’s my honor to celebrate her many contribu-
tions and name her our Iowan of the Week.
