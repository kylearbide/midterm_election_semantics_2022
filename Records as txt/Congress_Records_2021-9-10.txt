PRAYER 
Rabbi 
Arnold 
E. 
Resnicoff, 
U.S. 
Navy, Retired, Washington, D.C., of-
fered the following prayer: 
Almighty God, 20 years ago today, an 
era ended: pre-9/11 world. 
Twin Towers stood. No deadly Pen-
tagon attack. No civilian airline pas-
sengers, crew had sacrificed their lives 
to protect the Capitol from attack. 
Next day, our world forever changed. 
High holy days now challenge Jews 
worldwide: assess, atone, improve. 
But regardless of religion, Americans 
now share holy days, blessed by memo-
ries of the righteous who kept faith 
alive. 
Terrorists did their worst. We re-
sponded with our best: heroes sac-
rificed, rescued, healed, then we united 
to rebuild, as we must unite today. 
Where the Pentagon was struck, we 
built a chapel, interfaith. Our beliefs 
attacked, we celebrated unity, diver-
sity, hope. 
Day’s end, leaders gathered on Cap-
itol steps, Democrat, Republican, side- 
by-side. Silent prayer. Then ‘‘God Bless 
America,’’ they sang. 
May unity then inspire us now, heed-
ing America’s ‘‘Liberty Song″: ‘‘Join 
hand-in-hand, brave Americans all, by 
uniting we stand, by dividing we fall.’’ 
And may we say: 
Amen.

H. RES. 626 
Whereas, on September 11, 2001, while 
Americans were attending to their daily rou-
tines, terrorists hijacked four civilian air-
craft, crashing two of them into the towers 
of the World Trade Center in New York City, 
a third into the Pentagon near Washington, 
DC, and a fourth was prevented from also 
being used as a weapon against America by 
brave passengers who placed their country 
above their own lives; 
Whereas thousands of innocent Americans 
were killed and injured as a result of these 
attacks, including the passengers and crew 
of the four aircraft, workers in the World 
Trade Center and in the Pentagon, rescue

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4514 
September 10, 2021 
Whereas the crewmembers of United Flight 
175, American Flight 11, American Flight 77, 
and United Flight 93 acted as first respond-
ers, reporting the first intelligence of a war 
the United States did not know it was fight-
ing and sacrificing their own lives to protect 
the United States and the lives of countless 
others; 
Whereas 20 years later the country con-
tinues to, and shall forever, mourn their 
tragic loss and honor their memory; 
Whereas these attacks destroyed both tow-
ers of the World Trade Center, as well as ad-
jacent buildings, and seriously damaged the 
Pentagon; 
Whereas these attacks were by far the 
deadliest terrorist attacks ever launched 
against the United States, and, by targeting 
symbols of American strength and success, 
were intended to assail the principles, val-
ues, and freedoms of the United States and 
the American people, intimidate our Nation, 
and weaken its resolve; 
Whereas memorials have been constructed 
to honor the victims of these attacks at the 
Pentagon, in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and 
on the World Trade Center grounds, so that 
Americans and people from around the world 
can visit to mourn those lost and to pay trib-
ute to the heroic action and sacrifice of 
those who have served our communities and 
our country in the years since the attacks; 
Whereas 20 years after September 11, 2001, 
the United States continues to fight terror-
ists and other extremists who threaten 
America and her friends and allies; 
Whereas successive Congresses and admin-
istrations have assisted victims of terrorism, 
protected our Nation, combated terrorism at 
home and abroad, and supported the mem-
bers of the Armed Forces who courageously 
defend the United States; 
Whereas by the tireless efforts of our intel-
ligence, military, and law enforcement pro-
fessionals, the United States has been able to 
significantly degrade the al Qaida network, 
by taking into custody or killing senior al 
Qaida leaders, operational managers, and 
key facilitators, and owes a debt of gratitude 
to the focused and persistent efforts of all 
those personnel involved in the removal of 
Osama bin Laden; 
Whereas the terrorist attacks that have 
occurred around the world since September 
11, 2001, remind us of the hateful inhumanity 
of terrorism and the ongoing threat it poses 
to freedom, justice, and the rule of law; 
Whereas United States law enforcement 
and intelligence agencies and allies of the 
United States around the world have worked 
together to detect and disrupt terrorist net-
works and numerous terror plots since Sep-
tember 11, 2001; 
Whereas the Nation is indebted to the 
brave military, intelligence, law enforce-
ment, and civilian personnel serving around 
the world in advancement of United States 
national interests; 
Whereas thousands of families have lost 
loved ones in the defense of freedom and lib-
erty against the tyranny of terror; and 
Whereas the passage of 20 years has not di-
minished the pain caused by the senseless 
loss of nearly 3,000 persons killed on Sep-
tember 11, 2001: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) recognizes September 11 as a day of sol-
emn commemoration; 
(2) extends again its deepest sympathies to 
the thousands of innocent victims of the 
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and to 
their families, friends, and loved ones; 
(3) honors the heroism and the sacrifices of 
United States military and civilian per-
sonnel and their families who have sacrificed 
much, including their lives and health, in de-
fense of their country; 
(4) credits the heroism of first responders, 
law enforcement personnel, State and local 
officials, volunteers, and others who aided 
the victims of these attacks and, in so doing, 
bravely risked their own lives and long-term 
health; 
(5) expresses thanks and gratitude to the 
foreign leaders and citizens of all nations 
who have assisted and continue to stand in 
solidarity with the United States against 
terrorism in the aftermath of the attacks on 
September 11, 2001, and asks them to con-
tinue to stand with the United States 
against international terrorism; 
(6) commends the military and intelligence 
personnel involved in the removal of Osama 
bin Laden; 
(7) reasserts its commitment to opposing 
violent extremism arrayed against American 
interests and to providing the United States 
military, intelligence, and law enforcement 
communities with the resources and support 
to do so effectively and safely; 
(8) vows that it will continue to identify, 
intercept, and disrupt terrorists and their 
activities; 
(9) reaffirms that the American people will 
never forget the sacrifices made on Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and will never bow to ter-
rorist demands; and 
(10) declares that when Congress adjourns 
today, it stands adjourned out of respect to 
the victims of the terrorist attacks. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f

11(b) of House Resolution 188 and House 
Resolution 626, the House stands ad-
journed until 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, 
September 14, 2021, as a further mark 
of respect for the victims of the ter-
rorist attack. 
Thereupon (at 11 o’clock and 35 min-
utes a.m.), under its previous order, the 
House adjourned until Tuesday, Sep-
tember 14, 2021, at 11 a.m. as a further

RECOGNIZING AMERICAN KIDNEY 
FUND’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the American Kidney Fund (AKF) 
for its outstanding leadership in the fight 
against kidney disease. AKF is located in 
Rockville, in Maryland’s 8th District, and I am 
proud to be AKF’s Representative in Con-
gress. This year marks the organization’s 50th 
anniversary and I invite my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing AKF’s five decades of work. 
AKF was founded in 1971 by a group of 
people who came together to help pay for a 
neighbor’s lifesaving dialysis treatment, and in 
the 50 years since, AKF has become a well- 
known and widely-respected charitable organi-
zation that is dedicated to meeting the needs 
of people affected by kidney disease. AKF is 
the nation’s leading independent nonprofit ad-
vocating on behalf of the 37 million Americans 
with kidney disease. AKF’s vision is a world 
without kidney disease—but until then, AKF 
will do everything in its power to ensure that 
every kidney patient has access to health 
care, and that every person at risk for kidney 
disease has the knowledge and resources to 
help prevent it. 
AKF notes that it touches more lives than 
any other kidney organization, with programs 
of prevention, early detection, and direct finan-
cial assistance that enable the nation’s low-in-
come dialysis and transplant patients to ac-
cess lifesaving medical care, disease manage-
ment support, clinical research, innovation and 
advocacy resources. The American Kidney 
Fund plays a leading role in educating and in-
forming the American people about kidney dis-
ease, raising public awareness about the fact 
that many cases of kidney disease are pre-
ventable, and spreading the message that 
when it is detected early, kidney disease can 
often be managed and its progression slowed. 
Recognizing that advanced kidney disease 
disproportionately affects minority populations, 
AKF and its 16,000 Ambassadors have been 
longtime advocates for these patients and 
their communities. One area of focus for the 
organization has been to educate the public 
about the importance of increasing the partici-
pation of minority populations in clinical trials, 
which are critical to developing better treat-
ments for conditions like kidney disease. Mi-
nority 
populations 
have 
historically 
been

TRIBUTE TO LANCE CORPORAL 
KAREEM M. NIKOUI 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to a hero and true American pa-
triot, Norco resident and Marine Corps Lance 
Corporal Kareem M. Nikoui. Today, I ask that 
the House of Representatives honor and re-
member this incredible young man who died in 
service to our country on August 26, 2021, as 
the result of a terror attack in Kabul, Afghani-
stan. 
Through his actions, Lance Corporal Nikoui 
has evoked pride in his community for many 
years. He was passionate about the martial art 
of jiu jitsu and won multiple medals at com-
petitions throughout the region. As a student 
at Norco High School, Lance Corporal Nikoui 
joined the Air Force JROTC. He volunteered 
for Norco’s Pearl Harbor anniversary as well 
as POW events. According to his fellow 
JROTC cadet Gabrielle Murray, ‘‘He was a 
leader . . . he always tried to help out those 
in need.’’ 
After graduating from high school in 2019, 
Lance Corporal Nikoui joined the Marine 
Corps, where he was assigned to the 2nd Bat-
talion, 1st Marines unit stationed at Camp 
Pendleton. When he was afforded leave, he 
often returned home to Norco. Eager to share 
a home-cooked meal and the comforts of 
home with his fellow Marines, Lance Corporal 
Nikoui invited many of them to tag along for 
the short trip to Norco where his parents hap-
pily hosted. His father said his son loved his 
Marine Corps family. 
The compassion of Lance Corporal Nikoui 
once again shined bright during the final days 
of his life. Thrust into a chaotic and dangerous 
mission, he performed his duties with courage 
and empathy for people desperate for refuge 
and freedom. In addition to providing safe pas-
sage for Americans, our partners, and Af-
ghans, Lance Corporal Nikoui sought to com-
fort children in distress by giving them candy. 
Through his deeds, he embodied the ‘‘no bet-
ter friend’’ motto of the unit he served so faith-
fully until his last breath. 
As we look at the incredibly rich military his-
tory of our country, we realize that this history 
is comprised of men and women just like 
Lance Corporal Nikoui, who bravely fought for 
the ideals of liberty and democracy. Each 
story is unique and humbling for those of us 
who, far from the dangers they have faced, 
live our lives in relative comfort and ease. The 
day the Nikoui family learned of their son and 
brother’s death was surely the hardest day 
they have ever faced, and our thoughts, pray-
ers, and deepest condolences go out to them. 
His sacrifice is forever etched in our nation’s 
great history of freedom triumphing over op-
pression. Lance Corporal Nikoui’s family has 
given a part of themselves in the loss of their 
loved one, and we hope they know that the 
goodness he brought to this world and the 
sacrifice he has made will never be forgotten.

CONGRATULATING REV. DR. MEL-
VIN L. GRIMES ON THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF SERVING AS A 
MINISTER 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Rev. Dr. Melvin L. Grimes for 
celebrating 50 years as a Pastor and Minister. 
Melvin Grimes is the Pastor of Tabernacle 
Baptist Church as well as Executive Director 
of Churches United of the Quad City Area. 
Churches United serves hundreds of thou-
sands of local residents each year by bringing 
together an ecumenical coalition of Quad City 
area churches to help feed the hungry, offer 
emergency assistance to those in crisis; and 
provide transitional housing for women and 
children victims of domestic violence or human 
trafficking. By growing this church and its pro-
grams to help the needy, Melvin has made a 
profound impact in the Quad Cities commu-
nities throughout the years, and I commend 
him for his service not only as a pastor and 
leader, but also as a community member who 
cares deeply about other people. 
It is because of strong community leaders 
such as Rev. Dr. Melvin L. Grimes that I am 
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to again formally recognize Rev. Dr. Mel-
vin L. Grimes for his 50 years of service to the 
community and the church.

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER AND

DENNIS

HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, today I rise in honor of Niagara County 
Legislator Dennis Virtuoso. Dennis is a dedi-
cated public servant who is retiring after 30 
years of service and 15 terms in the Niagara 
County Legislature. 
Dennis is one of just two members to serve 
three decades in the Niagara County Legisla-
ture. As a longtime Democratic Caucus leader, 
he spent much of his time in office serving in

both majority and minority leadership. During 
the early 2000s. Dennis spent four years as 
Majority Leader and the last 16 years as Mi-
nority Leader. 
Throughout his tenure, Dennis vowed to 
keep the Niagara County Legislature trans-
parent and honest. When he first ran for of-
fice, he promised that he would never vote for 
a property tax increase. Thirty years later. 
Dennis has kept this promise. 
Dennis sponsored several resolutions during 
his time on the Niagara County Legislature. 
Most notable was a resolution, that passed, al-
lowing Niagara Country residents to speak be-
fore the Legislature; previous policy did not 
allow residents to have a voice. He also spon-
sored a resolution that put in place an Animal 
Abuse Registry that requires registration for 
anyone convicted of animal cruelty. The reg-
istry now serves as a model for the rest of 
New York State. Additionally, Dennis spon-
sored resolutions to reserve parking spaces 
for Purple Heart recipients. 
Of his many accomplishments, Dennis is 
most proud of his speech before Congress in 
the late 1970s. At the time, he was the presi-
dent of United States Steel Workers of Amer-
ica Local 12256. Dennis’s testimony led to im-
mediate action by President Jimmy Carter or-
dering NIOSH and OSHA to help the 500 em-
ployees at the Hyde Park/Bloody Run Landfill 
in Niagara Falls who were suffering from can-
cer and blood-related diseases due to chem-
ical exposure. The workers were able to ob-
tain necessary medical testing and landfill was 
subsequently closed. 
While serving as County Legislator, Dennis 
also worked full-time as a Niagara Falls build-
ing inspector, eventually becoming the city’s 
director of inspections. His true passion 
though, is working for the people of Niagara 
County. 
Dennis is the son of Carmella and the late 
Armand Virtuoso, a two-time Purple Heart re-
cipient and World War II veteran. He and his 
wife, Gina Virtuoso, have two sons and a 
daughter. Dennis is a Navy Seal, Vincent 
works at the Niagara Falls Water Plant, and 
Gina is a nurse. 
Dennis is passionate work over the past 30 
years gave the people of Niagara County a 
voice in government. Thank you, Madam 
Speaker, for the opportunity to recognize Leg-
islator Dennis Virtuoso’s well-deserved retire-
ment from the Niagara County Legislature. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Den-
nis for his leadership and service.

IN RECOGNITION OF OCTAVIO 
‘‘CHATO’’ VILLALOBOS 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
deep sense of gratitude and admiration that I 
rise today to celebrate Kansas City Police Offi-
cer Octavio ‘‘Chato’’ Villalobos. The son of 
Mexican immigrants, Chato has made it his 
life’s mission to serve and protect the people 
of Kansas City, Missouri while working tire-
lessly to ensure that communities of color are 
treated fairly and justly by our country’s crimi-
nal justice system. In light of the protests that 
swept across our nation last summer, it is per-
haps more important than ever before to rec-
ognize police officers like Chato, whose self-
less service is rooted in love and compassion 
for the people he protects. 
Born in Torrance, California and raised in 
Kansas City, Missouri, Chato takes great pride 
in belonging to Kansas City’s thriving Mexican- 
American community. Known by others for his 
thoughtful nature, Chato has always under-
stood that identifying as a Mexican-American 
police officer comes not only with immense 
pride, but with a profound sense of purpose 
and responsibility as well. Communities of 
color, including the Latino community, have 
faced racism, prejudice, and discrimination 
here in the United States for generations, and 
the injustices to which the Chicano community 
has been subjected are far too many to count. 
Chato knows this history well, but rather than 
letting it discourage him or dampen his spirits, 
he has used it as a constant source of motiva-
tion to make Kansas City a better place to call 
home, regardless of one’s skin color or na-
tional origin. 
Treating others the way he wishes to be 
treated, Chato has made significant strides to-
wards building trust between Kansas City’s 
police department and the Latino community it 
serves. Having worn the blue uniform for 
many years now, Chato understands that sim-
ply offering dignity and respect to the faces he 
meets while on patrol goes a long way toward 
creating a safer city where all people are treat-
ed fairly under the law. While negative stories 
capture headlines and screen time, Chato has 
lent a helping hand to the people of Kansas 
City any time the opportunity has arisen ever 
since the first time he donned the badge, and 
his compassionate nature has made him be-
loved throughout the city. 
Beyond his work as a police officer, Chato 
has served as a mentor to boys on the path 
to manhood, instilling values into our young 
people that will ensure their success down the 
road. Chato has advocated passionately on 
behalf of DACA, and regularly volunteers with 
organizations aimed at uplifting the Latino 
community. A committed father, Chato makes 
sure to teach his children about their Mexican 
heritage by taking them to local Chicano and 
Latino art festivals and celebrations, believing 
firmly that appreciating one’s genealogy helps 
build a sense of personal identity while giving 
us the strength to face the challenges of life. 
And in May of 2016, Chato’s heartfelt poem 
‘‘Brown Eyes in Blues’’ was read aloud to an 
audience in Kansas City by Juan Felipe Her-
rera, our nation’s first Latino Poet Laureate. 
Madam Speaker, the impact that Octavio 
‘‘Chato’’ Villalobos has made on the Kansas 
City community is greater than any speech of 
mine can encapsulate. As we enter Hispanic 
Heritage Month, let us take time to recognize 
public servants like Chato who work every day 
to make sure the United States is living up to 
its founding principles of liberty and justice for 
all. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF THE 
13 U.S. TROOPS WHO GAVE THEIR 
LIVES 
HELPING 
OTHERS 
TO 
FREEDOM 
HON. DARRELL ISSA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, on Thursday, 
August 26, 2021, as the U.S. military was 
working to airlift thousands out of Afghanistan 
amid chaos at Hamid Karzai International Air-
port in Kabul, terrorists murdered more than 
180 people including 13 members of the U.S. 
military there to assist American citizens seek-
ing to come home. 
Ten of those 13 U.S. troops were from a 
single unit at Camp Pendleton in San Diego 
County, just outside my district. Nine of them 
were Marines, part of the 2nd Battalion, 1st 
Marine Regiment. The tenth was a Navy 
corpsman attached to that unit. Their stories 
are now part of the long and valiant history of 
Camp Pendleton and the 2/1 battalion, known 
as ‘‘The Professionals.’’ 
The battalion saw combat at Guadalcanal 
and Okinawa in World War II and fought in 
Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq as well. It helped run 
a temporary shelter at Camp Pendleton for 
thousands of Vietnamese refugees following 
the fall of Saigon in 1975. 
In the days since the devastating news of 
last week’s terrorist attack, the local commu-
nity has embraced the families whose loved 
ones paid the ultimate price, creating a memo-
rial of flowers and American flags outside 
Camp Pendleton’s main gate in Oceanside. 
Five of the marines were only 20 years old, 
and all but one were under 25. Four were 
from California. 
They died doing an honorable job in an hon-
orable way. As the official Pentagon an-
nouncement described it, they were ‘‘sup-
porting non-combatant evacuation operations.’’ 
In other words, they were helping innocent ci-
vilians make it home safely. 
In devotion to their country, they were will-
ing to risk their own homecoming to secure a 
safe homecoming for others. That’s selfless 
service. That’s a meaningful life. Their families 
can be proud of how they lived their brief 
lives. 
While words seem powerless to ease the 
grief of loved ones suffering such a profound 
loss, I pray that their families can find some 
small comfort that a grateful nation honors the 
service and mourns the loss of these Amer-
ican heroes:

Navy Hospitalman Maxton W. Soviak: 22, of

Army Staff Sgt. Ryan C. Knauss: 23, of 
Corryton, Tennessee. 
More than just names on a list, they were 
each an individual hero who will be missed. 
The following is some of what has been re-
ported about each of them and their loved 
ones, according to CBS News: 
NAVY CORPSMAN MAXTON ‘‘MAX’’ W. SOVIAK, 22, OF 
BERLIN HEIGHTS, OHIO 
Corpsman Maxton ‘‘Max’’ W. Soviak played 
football at Edison High School before grad-
uating in 2017. 
‘‘As a football player he was full tilt 100 
miles an hour, fearless, which leads you to un-
derstand, you know, where he was and what 
maybe happened,’’ Jim Hall, head football 
coach at Edison, told CBS Cleveland, Ohio, 
affiliate WOIO–TV. 
‘‘It didn’t seem real,’’ Hall said. ‘‘It still really 
doesn’t, you know, great kid, loved life. He 
was bright, bright kid, and it doesn’t seem 
right. It doesn’t seem fair, you know. I just 
hope the best for his family. 
Soviak joined the Navy after high school 
graduation. 
‘‘He just loved life,’’ Edison High School su-
perintendent Thomas Roth told WOIO–TV. 
‘‘He was out there and enjoyed things, and he 
was helpful for others as I think we all can see 
from what happened yesterday. You know, he 
was always there to help other people. He 
wanted to be of service and that’s what he 
did.’’ 
ARMY STAFF SERGEANT RYAN C. KNAUSS, 23, OF 
CORRYTON, TENNESSEE 
Sergeant Ryan C. Knauss went to Gibbs 
High School before he enrolled in the Army, 
his family told CBS Knoxville, Tennessee, affil-
iate WVLT–TV. Knauss was a member of the 
Army’s 82nd Airborne division and a staff ser-
geant. 
Knauss had only been in Afghanistan for a 
week before his death but had previously 
spent nine months in the country, his grand-
mother told WVLT. 
No local funeral arrangements have been 
made at this time, family members said. 
Knauss will be buried at Arlington National 
Cemetery. 
MARINE CORPS STAFF SERGEANT DARIN T. HOOVER JR., 
31, OF SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH 
Sergeant Darin Hoover Jr. was on his third 
tour of duty, his father Darin Hoover Sr. told 
Salt Lake City CBS affiliate KUTV. 
‘‘He led his men, and they followed him, but 
I know in my heart of hearts he was out front,’’ 
Hoover Sr. said. ‘‘They [his fellow Marines] 
would follow him through the gates of hell if 
that’s what it took.’’ 
He said the 9/11 terrorist attacks moved his 
son, who was a child at the time, to vow he’d 
serve in the military. ‘‘He decided, ‘That’s what 
I want to do,’ ’’ Hoover Sr. told KUTV. 
Hoover Jr., 31, was based at Camp Pen-
dleton in California. 
‘‘(He was the) best kid in the world,’’ his fa-
ther said. ‘‘Couldn’t ask for any better.’’ 
MARINE CORPS SERGEANT JOHANNY ROSARIO 
PICHARDO, 25, OF LAWRENCE, MASSACHUSETTS 
Sergeant Johanny Rosario Pichardo was 
screening women and children at the Abbey 
gate when the attack took place, according to 
Marine First Lieutenant John ‘‘Jack’’ Coppola. 
He told CBS News in an email that Pichardo, 
a supply chief from the 5th Marine Expedi-
tionary Brigade, was a member of the bri-
gade’s Female Engagement Team (FET). 
FETs, he said, are ‘‘volunteer teams of female 
Marines with the experience and maturity nec-
essary to enable continuity of operations while 
respecting cultural norms.’’ 
Coppola said Pichardo’s service ‘‘was not 
only crucial to evacuating thousands of 
women and children, but epitomizes what it 
means to be a Marine: putting herself in dan-
ger for the protection of American values so 
that others might enjoy them.’’ 
Pichardo is a Lawrence High School grad-
uate and former Bridgewater State University 
student. She is survived by her mother and 
sister, CBS Boston reports, and will be laid to 
rest in Lawrence, where her family lives. 
‘‘It was her family’s wish that Rosario is re-
membered and honored as a hero,’’ Lawrence 
Mayor 
Kendrys 
Vasquez 
said 
Saturday. 
Bridgewater State University also released a 
statement saying the ‘‘community is struck 
with profound grief upon learning of the death 
of one of our own’’ even though Rosario only 
attended for a semester before committing 
herself to the Marines. 
MARINE CORPS SERGEANT NICOLE L. GEE, 23, OF 
SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA 
Marine Corps Sergeant Nicole L. Gee was 
one of several Marines seen cradling and 
comforting Afghan children amid evacuations 
just days before her death. On August 21, 
Gee posted a photo of herself holding an Af-
ghan child on lnstagram. ‘‘I love my job,’’ the 
23-year-old Sacramento native wrote. 
Gee was sworn into the Marines less than 
a year ago and was promoted to sergeant 
three weeks before the Kabul attack, accord-
ing to posts on her lnstagram account. 
Gee was married to a fellow Marine, Jarod 
Gee, her sister Misty Fuoco said. Nicole post-
ed several lnstagram photos of her and her 
husband celebrating the holidays and cele-
brating his own promotion to sergeant just a 
few months ago. 
MARINE CORPS CORPORAL HUNTER LOPEZ, 22, OF INDIO, 
CALIFORNIA 
Corporal Hunter Lopez joined the Marine 
Corps in 2017 and was a member of the 2nd 
Battalion, 1st Marines, according to a state-
ment released by the Riverside Sheriff’s De-
partment. 
Lopez, 22, was the son of Riverside Deputy 
Sheriff Alicia Lopez and Riverside Sheriff’s 
Captain Herman Lopez. He intended to follow 
his parents into law enforcement after his cur-
rent deployment and become a Riverside 
County sheriff’s deputy, the department’s 
statement said. 
MARINE CORPS CORPORAL DAEGAN W. PAGE, 23, OF 
OMAHA, NEBRASKA 
Corporal Daegan Page joined the Marine 
Corps after he graduated from Millard South 
High School, according to a statement his 
family released to local news outlets. 
He grew up in Red Oak, Iowa, and the 
metro Omaha area and was a member of the 
Boy Scouts. He enjoyed playing hockey and 
hunting and ‘‘spending time outdoors with his 
dad,’’ the statement said. He loved the Chi-
cago Blackhawks. 
Page ‘‘always looked forward to coming 
home and hanging out with his family and 
many buddies in Nebraska.’’ Once he finished 
his service in the Marines, he planned to at-
tend a local trade school and perhaps become 
an electrical lineman, the statement said. 
MARINE CORPS CORPORAL HUMBERTO A. SANCHEZ, 22, 
OF LOGANSPORT, INDIANA 
Corporal Humberto Sanchez was a 2017 
graduate of Logansport High School who 
played varsity soccer and was on the home-
coming court in his senior year, according to 
the lndyStar. 
The school’s principal, Matt Jones, told the 
lndyStar that Sanchez was one of five stu-
dents in his class who enlisted in the Marines. 
He remembered Sanchez as ‘‘a bright, athletic 
young man who was popular, well-liked by his 
soccer teammates, classmates, coaches, and 
teachers.’’ 
Logansport Mayor Chris Martin mourned 
Sanchez’s death in a Facebook post Friday. 
‘‘This young man had not yet even turned 
30 and still had his entire life ahead of him,’’ 
Martin wrote. ‘‘Any plans he may have had for 
his post-military life were given in sacrifice due 
to the heart he exhibited in putting himself into 
harm’s way to safeguard the lives of others.’’ 
Indiana Congressman JIM BAIRD posted his 
condolences on Facebook, too, saying, ‘‘He 
bravely answered the call to serve his nation, 
and I am both proud of his service and deeply 
saddened by his loss.’’ 
MARINE CORPS LANCE CORPORAL DAVID L. ESPINOZA, 
20, OF RIO BRAVO, TEXAS 
Lance Corporal David Espinoza, 20, was 
born and raised in Rio Bravo but attended 
high school in Laredo, CBS Dallas/Fort Worth 
reports. 
Congressman HENRY CUELLAR released a 
statement that said, in part, ‘‘Mr. Espinoza em-
bodied the values of America: grit, dedication, 
service, and valor. Mr. Espinoza is a hero.’’ 
The city of Laredo posted its condolences 
on Facebook. 
MARINE CORPS LANCE CORPORAL JARED M. SCHMITZ, 20, 
OF ST. CHARLES, MISSOURI 
For Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz, being a 
Marine ‘‘was something he always wanted to 
do,’’ his father, Mark Schmitz, said in an inter-
view, ‘‘and I never seen a young man train as 
hard as he did to be the best soldier he could 
be.’’ 
‘‘He just went over in the last two weeks,’’ 
his father, Mark Schmitz, told radio station 
KMOX in an interview Friday. Schmitz had 
been stationed in Jordan, and when the situa-
tion deteriorated in Afghanistan during the 
U.S. withdrawal, he was one of the thousands 
of U.S. troops deployed to Kabul. 
Mark Schmitz’s voice broke as he told 
KMOX, ‘‘I’m very honored that I could call him 
my son—his life meant so much more. I’m so 
incredibly devastated that I won’t be able to 
see the man that he was very quickly growing 
into becoming.’’ 
MARINE CORPS LANCE CORPORAL RYLEE J. MCCOLLUM, 
20, OF JACKSON, WYOMING 
Rylee Mccollum was a native of Bondurant, 
Wyoming. He attended Jackson Hole High 
School and was a 2019 graduate of Summit 
Innovations School in Jackson, according to 
CBS Wyoming affiliate KGWN–TV. 
He was a husband and expectant father, ac-
cording to The Associated Press. 
‘‘He was a Marine before he knew he was 
allowed to be a Marine,’’ McCollum’s sister, 
Cheyenne McCollum, told AP. 
An uncle of McCollum’s wife, Gigi, tweeted 
a picture of both of them at the dinner table: 
‘‘Thank you all for your prayers, outpouring 
love to Gigi, and recognizing our own Amer-
ican Hero.’’

Lance Corporal Dylan R. Merola had only 
been in Afghanistan for a little over a week, 
his mother told CBS Los Angeles. 
‘‘He was supposed to come home in a cou-
ple of weeks,’’ said a loved one. 
The Los Osos High School graduate

ergy about him and knew what he wanted to 
do,’’ Norco High School principal Robert 
Ibbetson said. ‘‘It was neat to see that kind of 
direction and drive and goal-setting.’’ 
He is survived by his mother, father and sib-
lings, the city of Norco confirmed Friday night.

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF CASA OF COLLIN COUN-
TY 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Court Appointed Special Ad-
vocates (CASA) of Collin County’s milestone 
30th anniversary of service to the community 
and to the abused and neglected children of 
North Texas. 
Since its establishment in 1991, CASA has 
served 100% of the abused and neglected 
children removed from their homes in Collin 
County. As the child’s official voice in court, 
these guardian ad litems work tirelessly to 
champion the best interests of the children 
they serve so that they receive needed serv-
ices while ensuring the child’s case moves 
through the system as quickly as possible. 
The ultimate goal of CASA is for each child to 
be reunited with family if appropriate or to be 
placed in a safe, permanent, and loving home. 
It is a mission their trained advocates do not 
take lightly. 
CASA’s network of trained advocates are 
often recognized for providing consistent, 
strong, and clear voices for abused and ne-
glected children as they navigate a com-
plicated legal system. CASA often serves as 
the only stable, trusted adult in the lives of 
these children as they navigate the changing 
dynamics of the foster care system. 
Since it’s inception, CASA has advocated 
for more than 12,000 children. Further, despite 
the challenges posed by the pandemic, the 
dedicated volunteer advocates, exceptional 
staff, outstanding leadership, and committed 
Board of Directors and Advisory Board once 
again rose to meet the needs of those they 
serve by adapting their processes to provide 
even greater support through new and innova-
tive ways. 
Now as we reflect upon the thirty years of 
selfless service performed by CASA of Collin 
County, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
thanking the organization and their decades of 
fierce advocates for changing the lives of 
countless children in our community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM 
R. SANCHEZ 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of William R. Sanchez who 
passed away at the age of 103 on August 23, 
2021. Mr. Sanchez was a longtime constituent 
of mine in Monterey Park, California, and an 
American patriot who bravely served our coun-
try during World War II. 
Mr. Sanchez was born on July 18, 1918, in 
El Paso, Texas, and moved with his family to 
Los Angeles at the age of one. He graduated 
from Thomas Jefferson High School in 1938 
and immediately joined the Civilian Conserva-
tion Corps, where he worked in Northern Cali-
fornia managing forests and building roads. 
He received a boxing scholarship to UCLA, 
but instead decided to enlist in the U.S. Army 
in 1940. In search of adventure, Mr. Sanchez 
chose to serve at Fort Mills on Corregidor Is-
land in the Philippines. He was assigned to 
Army Intelligence on the island and served on 
General Douglas MacArthur’s staff. While 
working with Army Intelligence, he helped pro-
vide advance notice of the Japanese force on 
its way to attack Pearl Harbor. 
In 1942, Sgt. Sanchez fought in the Battle of 
Corregidor and was taken as a prisoner of war 
after keeping the Japanese at bay for five 
months. Like thousands of other American 
prisoners of war, he experienced unimaginable 
atrocities on the Bataan Death March. He was 
then transferred on a Japanese ‘‘hell ship’’ 
and taken to Camp Omori near Tokyo, where 
he was constantly abused, beaten, and under-
fed. Sgt. Sanchez’s mental fortitude helped 
him endure these brutal conditions for over 
three years until the end of the war. 
After the war, he returned to the U.S. and 
attended Woodbury College where he earned 
his bachelor’s degree. He then went on to 
earn a master’s degree in International Trade 
and Finance from USC. He started his own 
company, Belenco, and became one of the 
biggest importers and suppliers of rolled steel 
products on the West Coast. Mr. Sanchez set-
tled with his family in Monterey Park in 1958 
and took an active role in the community. 
Over the years, he remained active in the vet-
eran community, serving as the keynote 
speaker at many veterans forums, and offering 
advice and support to countless veterans and 
their families on their benefits and rights. 
William Sanchez was truly a hero of our 
time. He leaves behind an enduring legacy of 
service and sacrifice to our nation, and that is 
why it is my distinct honor to commemorate 
his life. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF L.D. 
‘‘JACK’’ GRIFFIN 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of L.D. ‘‘Jack’’ Griffin, who 
passed away on Saturday, July 24, 2021, at 
the age of 94. 
On April 11, 1927, Jack was born in Mon-
roe, Louisiana, to Sam and Alma Lee Mullican 
Griffin. He married Myra Collier, and they 
spent 68 years together. Jack and Myra were 
blessed with two children, Ky and Leeza. 
Jack patriotically served our country in the 
United States Navy during World War II. He 
was a longtime resident of Tyler County and 
continued to faithfully serve his community as 
a member of the First Baptist Church of 
Woodville. Jack was also a part of the Mag-
nolia Masonic Lodge No. 495 in Woodville. As 
a Mason, he attained the 32nd Degree, an 
honor bestowed for his outstanding service. 
He was also a member of the El Mina Shrine 
in Galveston, Texas. 
Jack traveled the world as a pipeliner. His 
specialty was in water crossings. Jack skillfully 
engineered 
and 
constructed 
pipelines 
in 
Straits of Mackinac, the Puget Sound, the 
Straits of Gibraltar, and many places in be-
tween. Jack retired as Director of Field Serv-
ices with Williams Companies based in Tulsa, 
Oklahoma. 
Jack is remembered as one who loved his 
family and looked forward to being amused 
and entertained at their regular gatherings. In 
the words of Henry David Thoreau, he went 
confidently in the direction of his dreams, liv-
ing a life more than he imagined. Even though 
he worked all over the world, he said of his 
beloved Woodville, ‘‘It may not have been 
where I intended to go, but I think I ended up 
where I needed to be.’’ 
Jack is survived by his wife, Myra Griffin of 
Woodville; son, Ky D. Griffin and wife Rhonda 
of Jasper; daughter, Leeza Blanchette and 
husband Jacques of Woodville; grandchildren, 
Blake Blanchette and wife Helen of Sinton, 
Megan Parmer and husband Randy of The 
Woodlands, Brent Blanchette of Woodville, 
Blaire Rogers and husband Dwight of North 
Palm Beach, Florida and Collier Griffin of Chi-
cago, Illinois; great-grandchildren, Caroline, 
Libby, and Ellie Blanchette, Emerson Parmer, 
and Sutton, Quint, and Griffin Rogers; sisters- 
in-law, Carolyn Collier of Goldsboro, North 
Carolina and Judy Sheffield of Houston; 
nieces, Kim Nagypal and husband Bela of 
Woodville, Tammy Bohannon of Allen, and 
Cristi Connor and husband Paul of Houston. 
Jack was preceded in death by his parents, 
Sam and Alma Griffin, and his brother-in-law 
Malcolm Collier. 
Madam Speaker, I honor my friend Jack 
Griffin as one of the last members of the 
Greatest Generation. His faithful service to our 
country and his community will not be forgot-
ten, and my heartfelt prayers remain with his 
family and friends during this difficult time.

HONORING SIOUX FALLS LITTLE 
LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
the members of the Sioux Falls Little League 
baseball team, who represented the great 
State of South Dakota in the 2021 Little 
League World Series. 
Sioux Falls had a remarkable season plac-
ing fourth after a truly amazing series of vic-
tories. Through their hard work and persever-
ance, they have become the most successful 
Little League team in South Dakota history. 
They are also the first team in the history of 
the Little League World Series ever to pitch 
four no-hitters. 
During their historic Little League World Se-
ries run, this team has shown incredible deter-
mination, teamwork, and resiliency. So many 
South Dakotans truly enjoyed following along 
and cheering on the hometown team. I, along 
with the entire State of South Dakota, am 
proud of them for this outstanding accomplish-
ment and for representing our State on the na-
tional stage. 
My sincerest congratulations to Easton, 
Hayden, Noah, Alex, Gunnar, Beau, Kye, Bos-
ton, Sam, Brayson, Jacksyn, Opland, Gavin, 
Cason, Maddux, and Brekken, as well as 
Coach Mike, Coach Jeff, Coach Devin, and 
Coach Ryan. I commend each one of you on 
your success, and I look forward to seeing 
what great things you will accomplish in the 
future.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOSE ‘‘JOE’’ 
ARCE AND THE TWENTY-FIFTH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
KANSAS 
CITY’S HISPANIC NEWS 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to rise today to recognize and celebrate 
the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Kansas City 
Hispanic News, a weekly bilingual newspaper 
published and owned by Jose ‘‘Joe’’ Arce, that 
has continuously served the Greater Kansas 
City community in Missouri’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. Since its creation, the Kansas 
City Hispanic News has helped bridge the gap 
with the Latino community by offering rep-
resentation on a mainstream paper. Wholly 
devoted to establishing top quality media cov-
erage via in-depth stories in both Spanish and 
English, Arce and his publication have made a 
monumental impact on the Latino community. 
The Kansas City Hispanic News opened its 
door in 1996 along Southwest Boulevard, lo-
cated in Kansas City’s Westside neighbor-
hood, a community heavily influenced by 
Latino and Mexican American roots. Through 
investigative reporting and providing commu-
nity members with stories in two languages, 
the weekly newspaper has increased its cov-
erage to extend beyond the state line into 
Kansas, showing the impact on Latino house-
holds. With this newspaper, Arce has provided 
a platform for Latinos to be represented, in-
formed, and engaged as local businessowners 
through advertising opportunities, giving the 
Latino community a place to flourish and 
thrive. 
Born and raised in Kansas City’s West Side, 
Arce always felt in touch with his Mexican 
roots and Latino background. Before he start-
ed the bilingual newspaper, he worked as a 
photojournalist and reporter for WDAF-TV Fox 
4 News, dedicating himself to serving the peo-
ple in his community through journalism. After 
years of experience, Arce realized the lack of 
representation and reporting catered to the 
Latino population and took it upon himself to 
start a paper that could inform and celebrate 
the accomplishments of the Latino community. 
As an involved civic leader, Arce used the bi-
lingual paper as a vehicle of information on 
important topics that affected Latinos such as 
elections, workers’ rights, local businesses, 
and celebrations. His efforts allowed people to 
feel connected to not only their roots but to 
their local community and offered access to in-
formation for those who were only Spanish 
speakers. 
While the Kansas City Hispanic News is one 
of his most influential additions to the Fifth 
District, Arce’s contributions extend beyond 
journalism. As an active civic leader, Arce has 
served on boards for numerous organizations 
such as the Guadalupe Centers and the His-
panic Chamber of Commerce of Greater Kan-
sas City. Additionally, Arce was one of the key 
figures in the distinguished victory of renaming 
23rd Street in the Westside Neighborhood in 
Kansas City, Missouri to Avenida Cesar Cha-
vez after activist Cesar Chavez in 1993. To in-
crease representation and local celebrations 
related to Latino and Mexican American tradi-
tions, Arce helped expand Fiesta Hispana KC, 
an annual festival held in Kansas City to cele-
brate Mexico’s Independence Day as well as 
Hispanic Heritage Month. 
Through this festival, community members 
have been able to partake in the celebration 
that brings music, food, dance, and local busi-
nesses, further connecting the Latino commu-
nity as well as providing others to learn more 
about Latino culture. Arce is known to be a 
friend, mentor, and a loyal supporter of youth 
journalists. To help Latino students pursuing 
journalism, Arce founded the Hispanic Media 
Association, which provides scholarships. Fur-
thermore, Arce served as the chair of the 
Cesar E. Chavez committee at the University 
of Central Missouri for 15 years where he fo-
cused on finding ways to attract Latino stu-
dents to the campus. Arce’s unwavering devo-
tion and tireless commitment to serve and bet-
ter the Latino community is a testament of his 
compassionate and caring nature. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing and thanking Joe Arce and the Kansas 
City’s Hispanic News for all they have done 
for Kansas City and Missouri’s Fifth Congres-
sional District in the last twenty-five years. I 
am honored to have someone like Arce, a 
champion of public service and civic leader, in 
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District which I 
represent. His immense impact on the Latino 
community and Kansas City will continue to be 
felt for years to come. Let us celebrate Joe 
Arce’s job well done and wish him many more 
years of success. 
CELEBRATING EP!C’S 70TH BIRTH-
DAY OF SERVICE TO THE COM-
MUNITY 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate EP!C’s 70th Birthday of empow-
ering and inspiring people with disabilities 
through the services and support they provide 
to the community. 
EP!C offers a range of programs and serv-
ices to help individuals with disabilities with 
educational, 
residential, 
employment, 
and 
care-taking resources. EP!C was founded in 
1950, and began as a group of Peoria-area 
parents who wanted to provide their special 
needs children with education and opportunity. 
These parents decided to open a school in 
1957, and what started out as an organization 
to help 10 children has now helped over 600 
individuals with intellectual disabilities, cerebral 
palsy, Down syndrome, autism, epilepsy, and 
other intellectual or developmental disabilities. 
I commend EP!C for its work in the Peoria 
community, and I thank the management and 
staff for their dedication to helping people with 
intellectual disabilities. 
It is because of strong organizations such 
as EP!C that I am especially proud to serve Il-
linois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate EP!C on its 70th Birthday.

A PIECE OF GLASS, IN MEMORY 
OF THOMAS BUTLER OF SQUAD 
ONE 
HON. ANDREW R. GARBARINO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a poetic tribute in honor of Thomas 
Butler and his father, William. I presented to 
his family on the day of his funeral after his fa-
ther had given me a piece of glass from the 
World Trade Center where Thomas died. I in-
clude in the RECORD this poem, penned by Al-
bert Caswell. 
A PIECE OF GLASS 
(by Albert Carey Caswell) 
A Father and a Hero who raised a fine son 
A man who dedicated his entire life to saving 
others this one 
As too his fine son’s life journey had just 
begun 
His little boy, 
his pride and joy 
as one day too he’d follow his father’s most 
courageous footsteps his son 
And try as he may, 
this most splendid of all men who so many 
had saved, 
could not but save his own most precious of 
all ones 
A piece of glass now in my hands 
As once before stood so very grand 
Within your two great Twin Towers, 
gracing this fair city throughout all the 
hours 
as high above a majestic skyline you ran 
With your twin bright beacons of hope, 
and your islands of ingenuity and determina-
tion to all hearts spoke

With your Gotham Tributes to all of Woman-
kind and Man which invoked 
And from that first day begun 
As 
a 
construction 
worker 
peering 
out 
through you up towards the rising sun 
Until, that final opening day 
When, your most magnificent fruition was 
portrayed, 
in this your most historic of all runs 
And with each new succeeding day 
While, gazing through you and pressing 
hands all upon you as would they 
And how many countless hours, 
throughout all those snow storms, blizzards, 
thunder storms and rain showers 
When, upon a bright beautiful spring day, 
planning their escapes, counting the minutes 
. . . to the seconds . . . the hours 
Running down below to their most beloved 
ones so, 
as there they would come rushing out of 
your most majestic of all Towers 
And how many weddings were so amassed? 
With, young hearts here so enamored as the 
time had passed 
As it was all here along love’s path 
And how about all those most beautiful ba-
bies born, 
from all those true fine loves warmed here so 
to last 
Ah yes, as it was in this the most magnifi-
cent of all buildings, 
which held so many hearts at bay with the 
spells that they’d cast 
On 9/11, while looking out you on that fine 
fall day 
Up towards those jet blue skies as the white 
clouds drifted on by and far away 
As so unsuspectingly their own death’s they 
could not for see, 
unaware of what dreaded dark death and 
dark evil before them now lay 
Perhaps, with but thoughts of loved ones 
beating in their hearts on that day, 
at what was to be their last and most trag-
ically heroic of all days 
And ‘Oh . . . . but did you so see all of those 
planes coming crashing in and so 
wince? 
While, watching in such shock and in horror 
at all of its most vulgar carnage 
At the lost of all those fine innocents 
As down below you witnessed all those brave 
hearts, 
magnificent souls gallantly rushing in with-
out regard of consequence 
Our most fearless firefighters, and most pre-
cious police, 
and brave citizen saviors who stayed armed 
with but only their beliefs 
And ’oh how it must have shattered you to 
see 
All of those splendid people, women and men 
Together holding hands, jumping off in such 
misery and grief 
As I ask you now, did Tommy in those last 
final moments 
While, looking through you think of his 
most beloved family out too his heart 
reached. 
As he came rushing up the stairs on his way 
to Heaven, 
passing death’s cold stare to our Lord speaks 
As he stood there, as one of the most coura-
geous of all ones 
So Magnificently Bill Butler’s fine son 
And from this day of all days what are we all 
here to so take 
With all such grief and so much horrendous 
heartache 
That still within our beating hearts, 
within its rhythm something far much more 
greater now to take 
And from all of their most tragic deaths of 
which we are now left 
Are all those bright lights as Angels names 
up in Heaven now bless 
Comes this great consolation in hearts 
knowing, 
that all those who heroically died to Heaven 
surely rose up no less 
Burying our babies, our daughters and sons 
for there can be no greatest pain for a parent 
begun 
While, there in the darkness all alone, 
our Lord sees and hear’s your most desperate 
of all moans 
Up in Heaven our Lord in his love cries, 
as his tears wash down upon us when there 
comes a gentle rain from his eyes 
To ease our pain for all our lost daughters 
and sons 
Somehow find the strength until your re-
united again 
A piece of glass as given to me 
By a wonderful Father, 
all in the midst of this his families most 
dark tragedy 
Forever and a day, 
as with me this his most precious of all gift’s 
will stay 
To be ever revered in my family 
As it’s with chills I now stand . . . with quiv-
ering hands, 
remembering the sacred name of a hero 
named Thomas Butler eternally 
And from this day on a great lesson as born, 
to teach my children of Thomas’s sacrifice so 
warm 
And for the generations to come, 
I shall plant those seeds of his faith to all of 
my children and theirs among 
Of all those like Thomas who died and sac-
rificed like Christ to Kingdom Come 
About all their selfless seeds of faith, cour-
age and sacrifice 
With their greatest gifts but for the greater 
good to give up ones life 
To nourish others’ souls about Thomas’s life 
Remembering 9/11 and all those fine heroes, 
and all their sacred gifts who which did not 
to think twice 
A piece of glass, was once but just mere sand 
As it is we who here who are made up of flesh 
and blood and hands 
Who here with hearts and souls and coura-
geous acts and in our tears now stand 
Goodness . . . Evil . . . Darkness . . . Light 
In the moment of truth will we burn bright? 
Will we reside in the darkness or choose rise 
up in the light? 
And for all those who do, 
are but our Lord’s chosen people in his heart 
burns bright 
As we peer back through time 
looking back upon this the very soul of 
Woman and Mankind 
That on this day we fully understand 
That buildings can rise, 
and in time may not stand 
But, in our Lord’s heart 
There are far greater thing’s which command 
Which, leaves him in awe 
Of the most sacred of all gifts to understand 
All those who give up one’s life for another 
will rest in God’s hands 
As here I stand, with a sacred piece of glass 
in my hands 
Forever and a day, 
these lessons of sacrifice and Thomas I’ll 
take on my way 
And a sacred piece of glass given to me by a 
wonderful man

HONORING RUTH HUNT CANDIES 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize a wonderful Kentucky business, Ruth 
Hunt Candies. The business, located in Mount 
Sterling, is celebrating 100 years of providing 
delicious candy to its customers. 
Ruth Tharpe Hunt’s family, friends, and es-
pecially her bridge club loved her homemade 
sweets. In 1921 she opened a small store in 
her home and began selling her candy to the 
public. The business quickly outgrew her 
home, and she built a small factory on Mt. 
Sterling’s Main Street. Ruth Hunt ran the busi-
ness with her daughter Emily Peck until the 
1960s. Emily ran the business until 1988, 
when the Kezele family and Tobby Moore took 
over and expanded into a comprehensive fac-
tory complex. Throughout the years, the busi-
ness has kept the same idea—‘‘Produce the 
highest quality chocolates to make the cus-
tomers happy.’’ 
Favorite 
confections 
include 
Kentucky 
Pulled Cream Candy, Caramels, Mallows, and 
Kentucky Bourbon Balls. The company’s most 
famous product, however, is Ruth Hunt’s Blue 
Monday Bar. This product has been produced 
for over 80 years and has been called a ‘‘Blue 
Monday’’ ever since a traveling minister told 
Ruth Hunt that ‘‘every Monday I must have a 
little sweet to help me through my blue Mon-
day!’’ 
Ruth Hunt Candies has stores in Mount 
Sterling and Lexington, Kentucky. Its products 
are sold in retail shops throughout the region 
and around the world. Products have been 
provided as gifts from the horse farms of the 
Bluegrass to the White House. 
Over the past 100 years, Ruth Hunt 
Candies has provided high-quality candy to 
customers and jobs to the local economy. 
Started in Ms. Hunt’s kitchen, the growth and 
longevity over 100 years is impressive. I con-
gratulate this wonderful business on their 
100th anniversary. It is my honor to recognize 
Ruth Hunt Candies before the United States 
Congress.

IMPEACHING GENERAL MILLEY 
AND SECRETARY AUSTIN 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to address the serious and deadly incom-
petence displayed by Mr. Biden and his cur-
rent military staff, including General Milley and 
Secretary of Defense Austin. The military lead-
ership has been irresponsible, careless, and 
incompetent regarding Afghanistan. After 20 
years, over $2 trillion wasted, and thousands 
of American lives lost, our military leadership 
lost this war and did so in a humiliating defeat 
played out in real time before the world. 
Our enemies are emboldened as our mili-
tary leaders showed cowardice and incom-
petence. Instead of resolve and a plan of ac-
tion to exit a war they could not justify or win, 
they evacuated our troops and abandoned ci-
vilians. They abandoned our allies and left

them to fend for themselves. The British were 
so incensed over this humiliating defeat and 
abandonment of their servicemembers on the 
field that the British Parliament passed a reso-
lution censuring Mr. Biden, a first in our na-
tion’s history. 
Our allies lost faith in their ability to count 
on us. 
In addition, our military leaders, led by the 
strange General Milley, who is obsessed with 
homosexuality in the military and flying gay 
pride flags at every opportunity, informed Con-
gress that we did not need to keep Bagram 
Air Base before the civilians were evacuated. 
His bungling led to a disaster with 13 of our 
servicemembers unnecessarily killed trying to 
control an airport that we had no control over 
and had many weak points compared to 
Bagram Air Base. His decision cost the lives 
of his troops. 
On top of this disastrous incompetence, 
General Milley and Secretary Austin aban-
doned over $80 billion in our top-notch military 
equipment and allowed it to fall into the hands 
of the very military we had been opposing. 
Milley and Austin failed to create a plan to re-
trieve, scuttle or destroy our valuable equip-
ment. Helicopters, airplanes, drones, missiles, 
automatic weapons, MRAPS, Humvees, am-
munition, mortars and howitzers were all lost 
to the enemy even though our leaders knew 
where the equipment was yet did nothing to 
stop the acquisition by the Taliban. 
This is gross incompetence and dereliction 
of duty. Both the very weirdly obsessed Gen-
eral Milley and Secretary Austin should have 
resigned in shame for the humiliation they 
brought to this country. But they have not. 
Therefore, we need to remove them. I will vote 
to impeach both Milley and Austin and remove 
the stain they have left on our military and our 
people. 
I include in the RECORD a letter from Ari-
zona Representative Walt Blackman. His letter 
needs to be read and shared and I join him in 
his conclusions. 
SEPTEMBER 3, 2021 
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: I proudly served 
21 years in the United States Army. Several 
times during my service I was on deployment 
to other countries. I was responsible for mili-
tary equipment valued at millions of dollars. 
I was trained as a private whose job was 
imperative to track, secure and dispose of 
military equipment in accordance with mili-
tary regulation. While I was stationed at 
Fort Hood there was a time when our mili-
tary installation was on complete lockdown 
because a soldier had misplaced a set of 
night vision goggles. Securing and tracking 
military 
equipment, 
especially 
sensitive 
items is a practice that is constantly drilled 
into all soldiers. 
According to UCMJ any servicemember of 
the United States Armed Forces who either 
willfully or by neglect sells, damages, de-
stroys, disposes of, or otherwise mismanages 
U.S. military property may face charges 
under Article 108 of the UCMJ. 
The Commander in Chief Joe Biden and the 
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin have 
placed America as well as multiple other 
countries in a vulnerable situation by not 
properly handling military property. This 
has allowed very sensitive military equip-
ment owned by the United States of America 
to fall into the hands of terroristic enemies. 
The Commander in Chief Joe Biden as well 
as the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin 
should be held accountable and in the same 
manner of the law as any other soldier would 
under Article 108 of the UCMJ. 
I am requesting you impeach Joe Biden 
and court-martial the Secretary of Defense 
Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley under 
Article 108 of the UCMJ. 
Respectfully, 
WALTER BLACKMAN,

HONORING U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 
AGRICULTURE FOREST SERVICE 
CHIEF VICKI CHRISTIANSEN FOR 
40 YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to 
honor 
Forest 
Service 
Chief 
Vicki 
Christiansen for 40 years of service to the pro-
tection and management of our nation’s for-
ests. 
Chief Christiansen began her career in for-
est service with the Washington State Depart-
ment of Natural Resources before joining the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service 
eleven years ago. She recently retired as For-
est Service Chief where she oversaw oper-
ations of more than 30,000 employees nation-
wide. 
Chief Christiansen’s career accomplish-
ments demonstrate her strong leadership skills 
and steadfast commitment to preserving and 
improving our nation’s environmental well- 
being. She began her distinguished career as 
a wild land firefighter with the Washington 
State Department of Natural Resources before 
advancing to become Washington State For-
ester, Arizona State Forester, Forest Service 
Deputy Director for Fire and Aviation Manage-
ment, and Forest Service Deputy Chief for 
State and Private Forestry. 
Appointed Forest Service Chief in 2018, 
Christiansen administered positive change 
while successfully managing intense episodes 
of crisis. She is revered by her colleagues for 
improving workplace safety, productivity, and 
culture as well as her resilient and calculated 
responses to the COVID–19 pandemic, eco-
nomic distress suffered by the agency, and 
disruptive 
natural 
occurrences 
such 
as 
wildfires and hurricanes. Furthermore, her col-
laboration with State and local actors played 
an instrumental role in improving community 
engagement in forestry protection nationwide. 
Through hard work and leadership that 
sparked 
long-lasting 
change, 
Chief 
Christiansen’s legacy will serve as a model for 
future Forest Service Chiefs to emulate. 
I would like to extend my most heartfelt ap-
preciation to Chief Christiansen for her years 
of exemplary service to the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture Forest Service and multiple 
state forest service agencies. I know I speak 
for our entire community in wishing her and 
her family continued success and happiness 
as she moves into retirement. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring 
Forest 
Service 
Chief 
Vicki 
Christiansen for her 40 years of service in for-
est protection and management. 
CELEBRATING THE BLACK 
THEATRE TROUPE’S 50TH SEASON 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate The Black Theatre Troupe’s 
50th season. Founded in 1970 by civil rights 
activist Helen K. Mason, this Phoenix troupe is 
one of the oldest continuously operating Black 
theater companies in the United States. De-
spite having to push back their 50th anniver-
sary season by a year due to COVID–19, the 
show will go on as The Black Theatre Troupe 
returns to the stage this month. 
The Black Theatre Troupe was born of the 
need to create a space for Black voices to be 
heard in the Southwest. Today, it has grown 
into a nationally recognized, award-winning 
theater company that continues to tackle 
issues of racism, prejudice, and discrimination. 
Fifty years later, The Black Theatre Troupe re-
mains a vital platform for illuminating the Black 
experience and culture, provides unique op-
portunities for multiethnic and underserved art-
ists to train and perform, and educates and 
entertains a diverse audience. 
Throughout its history, The Black Theatre 
Troupe has faced many challenges—lack of 
funding, a fire that destroyed its stage, and 
even a global health pandemic—but thanks to 
the tenacity and enthusiasm of its members 
and supporters, the Troupe has continued to 
grow and thrive. I’d like to congratulate The 
Black Theatre Troupe on 50 seasons and wish 
them all the best for 50 more.

IN HONOR OF THE 2021 LITTLE 
LEAGUE WORLD SERIES CHAM-
PIONS, THE TAYLOR NORTH LIT-
TLE LEAGUE TEAM 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Taylor North Little 
League Team, the winners of the 2021 Little 
League World Series. This team’s tremendous 
accomplishment is worthy of commendation. 
After defeating their opponents at the dis-
trict, state, and Great Lakes Regional cham-
pionship, the Taylor North team was not yet 
done. On August 29, 2021., they won 5–2 
against Ohio’s Hamilton West Side team at 
Lamade Stadium in Williamsport, Pennsyl-
vania. Throughout the championship they de-
feated seven state champions and came out 
on top with a record of 19–1. In a season that 
was as challenging as it was rewarding, the 
team’s tireless dedication to baseball and 
commitment to teamwork paid off when they 
became world champions at just twelve years 
old. These players proved that with hard work 
and confidence in your teammates, there is no 
obstacle that is too big to overcome. 
No Michigan Little League team has won 
the World Series since 1959. This team put 
Michigan Little League back on the map after 
62 years. They brought their win back home to 
Taylor, Michigan to be met with a fitting home-
coming victory parade complete with cheering

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
MATTHEW J. MCCARTHY 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize the outstanding life and legacy of Mat-
thew J. McCarthy, age 35, who passed away 
far too soon on Friday, August 13, 2021. A tal-
ented and respected trumpet player, com-
poser, arranger, and educator, Matt touched 
the lives of countless individuals and left a 
lasting impression on the central Florida music 
community. 
Matt was a professional trumpet player, spe-
cializing in modern and improvised music. He 
had experience playing all styles of music, in-
cluding jazz, big band, orchestral, chamber 
music, rock, ska, pop, commercial, salsa, and 
more. He worked with musicians and perform-
ance groups that included the Glenn Miller Or-
chestra, the Sam Rivers RivBea Orchestra, 
Cirque Du Soleil’s La Nouba, Junkierush, the 
Outer Toons, the Supervillans, Mad Sexual 
Genius, the Orlando Jazz Orchestra, the Harry 
James Orchestra, various bands of Walt Dis-
ney World, Universal Studios, the Smithsonian 
Jazz Orchestra, and countless other local 
groups and celebrities. Matt also spent a lot of 
time performing with the one and only Tommy 
Dorsey Orchestra, playing lead trumpet. It was 
with this group, he toured all over the United 
States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and 
on countless international cruises. 
A prolific composer and arranger, special-
izing in custom arrangements and charts, Matt 
had experience in transcription, copywork, and 
orchestration for groups of all sizes. His library 
included hundreds of arrangements for jazz 
chamber groups, big bands, large orchestras, 
latin ensembles, and original compositions for 
a variety of groups. Frequently premiering new 
works, 
his 
arrangements 
became 
highly 
sought after, especially for competitive march-
ing bands. 
Matt began his career in music at the Uni-
versity of Central Florida, where he studied 
trumpet, composition, and jazz studies, grad-
uating with a dual-specialty Bachelor of Music 
degree in 2007. During that time, he began 
working as a freelance trumpet player and ar-
ranger. This eventually led to a long career 
with the bands of Walt Disney World. Addition-
ally, Matt started subbing in the trumpet sec-
tion for the Sam Rivers RivBea Orchestra, 
which began a life-long interest in experi-
mental and avant-garde music. 
Matt furthered his musical career in 2013 by 
attending graduate school at the University of 
South Florida, where he graduated with a 
Master of Music in jazz composition in 2015. 
There he studied with Chuck Owen and Jack 
Wilkins. During his tenure at USF, Matt per-
formed as lead trumpet player for Jazz En-
semble I, served as director of Jazz Ensemble 
II, and taught various courses in the Jazz 
Studies Department. Matt frequently appeared 
with the USF Jazz Faculty Ensemble and 
toured Italy with the USF Jazztet in the sum-
mer of 2015, performing at the Umbria Jazz 
Festival in Perugia, Italy. While studying com-
position, Matt was awarded the Owen Prize 
for Jazz Composition for his tune. ‘‘Hans the 
Hunter.’’ 
Matt McCarthy leaves behind a legacy of 
kindness, imagination, and musical excellence. 
Matt’s positive and creative outlook on life 
touched the lives of so many and made our 
community a better place. I am saddened by 
the loss of such a valuable member of the 
community and extend my heartfelt condo-
lences to his family and friends.

COMMEMORATING THE 20TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 
11TH ATTACKS 
HON. YVETTE HERRELL 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to commemorate the 20th anniversary of 
the September 11th terrorist attacks. On that 
day, 19 al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four air-
craft and claimed the lives of 2,974 people, 
shocking our nation and the world. 
The devastation and destruction from that 
day was heartbreaking, but was swiftly over-
come by American resilience following the at-
tacks. Heroic first responders ran towards 
danger, risking their own lives to rescue vic-
tims, and their selfless fortitude will always be 
remembered. The brave passengers of Flight 
93 prevented further tragedy by overwhelming 
terrorist hijackers; their courage saved count-
less American lives. Regardless of political 
party, race, or creed, the 9/11 attacks on our 
nation remind us of the unifying values that 
can bring Americans together on the darkest 
of days. 
Today, I want to especially commend the 
work of the men and women responsible for 
the new 9/11 Memorial Monument in New 
Mexico. This community-sponsored Memorial 
Monument in the Village of Williamsburg was 
created by hardworking and dedicated New 
Mexicans to pay solemn tribute to those we 
lost on 9/11, and the heroes who rose amid 
the flames. Following the attacks, 42 of New 
Mexico’s finest traveled across the country to 
assist in search and rescue operations; our 
country will forever be grateful for all first re-
sponders served their fellow Americans. 
The tragedy of September 11th echoes to 
this day. Thousands of first responders, those 
who worked and lived in lower Manhattan, and 
crews that came in to clean up the rubble 
were exposed to toxic particles. By 2018, 
nearly 10,000 people were diagnosed with 9/ 
11-related cancers. These heroes deserve to 
have the best of care, and I am thankful that 
President Trump extended the Victim Com-
pensation Fund through 2092. 
September 11th, 2001 will forever be re-
membered as ‘‘Patriot Day,’’ a National Day of 
Service and remembrance. I commend all the 
first responders, volunteers, and countless 
numbers of men and women who responded 
to this great tragedy and continue to pray for 
all families who lost their loved ones.

HONORING GOLD MEDALIST JOHN 
BOIE OF MILTON 
HON. BRYAN STEIL 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor John Boie. A native of Milton, Wis-
consin, John Boie competed for Team USA at 
the 2020 Paralympics held this year in Tokyo, 
Japan. John was a member of Team USA’s 
Wheelchair Basketball and helped lead the 
team to a gold medal victory in a 64–60 win 
over Japan. John and his teammates secured 
a gold medal for the United States at the sec-
ond straight Paralympics for Men’s Wheelchair 
basketball. 
During a preliminary game against Iran, 
John was the heart of Team USA’s defensive 
effort turning 11 first half turnovers into 18 
points. The win over Iran contributed to the 
team’s 4–1 record in pool play allowing them 
to advance to the final knockout round at the 
2020 Paralympics Games. The team dem-
onstrated strong chemistry, bolstered by a 
common thread with five players having ties to 
UW-Whitewater, including John himself. To-
gether, the team competed in a thrilling gold 
medal matchup with the United States defeat-
ing Japan 64–60 in a come from behind win 
after trailing during the third quarter. In addi-
tion to scoring four points for Team USA, 
John’s strong defensive effort throughout the 
game helped the United States secure victory. 
John’s love for sports began at a young 
age. Despite suffering from an incomplete spi-
nal cord injury after an accident involving a 
tractor, John continued to demonstrate a love 
for the game of basketball. John was intro-
duced to wheelchair basketball after attending 
a wheelchair basketball summer camp at UW- 
Whitewater when he was eleven years old. 
John would go on to attend UW-Whitewater 
where he would become a three-time colle-
giate wheelchair basketball champion. John 
would go on to win a silver medal during the 
2018 World Championships. 
John represented the United States and 
Southeast Wisconsin with honor. He made 
both his country and community proud with his 
composure, talents, and determination. While 
this is his first gold medal, John’s passion for 
success suggests that it won’t be his last. I 
know Southeast Wisconsin will be backing him 
100 percent in his future endeavors. 
John’s 
perseverance 
through 
adversity 
helped lead to this historic success. I was 
proud to watch John represent Wisconsin and 
the United States on the world stage. On be-
half of Wisconsin’s First Congressional Dis-
trict, I would like to congratulate John on his 
tremendous accomplishment and wish him the 
best of luck.

HONORING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE THEODORE ROO-
SEVELT INAUGURAL SITE FOUN-
DATION 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize the Theodore Roosevelt In-
augural Site Foundation on its 50th anniver-
sary. 
On Friday September 6, 1901, President 
William McKinley was shot by anarchist Leon 
Czolgosz during a trip to the Pan-American 
Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Closely moni-
toring the situation from a family vacation in 
the Adirondack Mountains, Vice President 
Theodore Roosevelt traveled to Buffalo to pay 
his respects when it became apparent that 
President McKinley would not survive his inju-
ries. President McKinley died the day of Roo-
sevelt’s arrival, on Saturday, September 14, 
1901. 
It was only a matter of hours before the 
Vice President assumed the Office of the 
President of the United States. That same 
day, Vice President Roosevelt was sworn in 
as president at the residence of his close 
friend, and an esteemed lawyer, Mr. Ansley 
Wilcox, located at 641 Delaware Avenue. In 
taking his Oath of Office, Roosevelt declared, 
‘‘In this hour of deep and terrible national be-
reavement, I wish to state that it shall be my 
aim to continue, absolutely without variance, 
the policy of President McKinley, for the peace 
and honor of our beloved country.’’ 
In conjunction with the National Park Serv-
ice, the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site 
Foundation has maintained the residence on 
Delaware Avenue since 1971, with several 
missions in mind. First and foremost, the foun-
dation strives to uphold educational dialogues 
around the Roosevelt Presidency, ranging 
from the inauguration itself to his life, policy 
choices, and legacy. The foundation also high-
lights the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, 
which introduced Buffalo to the world as the 
first electrified city of light, powered by nearby 
Niagara Falls. More generally, the Theodore 
Roosevelt Inaugural Site Foundation highlights 
a period in Western New York’s history when 
it served the country as an industrial power-
house filled with driven, creative individuals 
seeking to build a new and better future. 
Today, the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural 
Site Foundation offers a variety of programs 
and experiences that aim to preserve the leg-
acy of President Roosevelt. The foundation 
displays a variety of exhibits and showcases 
within the home that examine Roosevelt’s in-
auguration and time in office. Tours are of-
fered at the nearby museum, as well as at 
sites of importance across the City of Buffalo. 
The foundation also hosts a ‘‘Speaker Nite’’ 
series of events, inviting esteemed individuals 
to explore issues of significance from Presi-
dent Roosevelt’s tenure and share how these 
issues remain relevant today. 
I thank the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural 
Site Foundation for its commitment to pre-
serving the unique history of the Western New 
York region, and I again congratulate the foun-
dation on its 50th anniversary. 
CONGRATULATING 
MAKENNA 
PEED FOR WINNING FOUR STATE 
TRACK MEDALS 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize MaKenna Peed of Kewanee High 
School for winning four gold medals for Track 
in the IHSA State Competition. 
MaKenna competed in the 100 meters 
(41.12 seconds), 200 meters (1:32.09), shot 
put (2.23 meters), and discus (5.28 meters), 
winning gold in all four events. She is also the 
first Kewanee High School athlete to medal in 
the Athletes with Disabilities Division. As a 
former student athlete, I admire and appre-
ciate MaKenna’s hard work and dedication to 
track. I am proud that she represented 
Kewanee High School and the community ex-
ceptionally well throughout the state. 
It is because of student leaders such as 
MaKenna that I am especially proud to serve 
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would once again like to congratu-
late MaKenna Peed on her success in Track 
while competing at the state level.

HONORING BERNARD A. BARTON, 
JR., IN CELEBRATION OF HIS RE-
TIREMENT 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Bernard 
A. Barton, Jr. on his retirement from the Li-
brary of Congress and to thank him for nearly 
three decades of dedicated public service. 
Following his service as a U.S. Air Force of-
ficer, Mr. Barton spent his career at the inter-
section of knowledge and technology. As Dep-
uty Chief Information Officer for the North 
Carolina National Guard, Mr. Barton designed 
the agency’s disaster recovery and continuity 
of operations capabilities, ensuring the Guard 
can meet its ‘‘Always Ready’’ motto. As Chief 
Information Officer for the Defense Technical 
Information Center, Mr. Barton ensured that 
the Department of Defense’s largest library 
had the IT infrastructure necessary to ‘‘fuse 
science and technology data’’ and ‘‘reliably de-
liver the knowledge needed to develop the 
next generation of technologies to support our 
Warfighters and help assure national security.’’ 
In 2015, Mr. Barton took on what Fortune 
Magazine labeled maybe the ‘‘hardest job in 
tech,’’ serving as the Chief Information Officer 
for the Library of Congress. Since then, he 
has ably guided the nation’s oldest federal cul-
tural institution through a complete techno-
logical overhaul. With aplomb, he oversaw the 
centralization of Library technology activities; 
fostered the creation of an agency-wide digital 
strategy; and marshalled efforts to optimize 
and modernize the Library’s IT infrastructure 
and critical IT business systems. Under his 
leadership, the Library completed a three-year 
Data Center Transformation, embracing the 
best of traditional IT services and the Cloud to 
ensure a stable, flexible, scalable foundation 
for the future. He also completely revamped IT 
security, and successfully addressed more 
than 100 major technology recommendations 
identified by Congress and the GAO. 
Through it all, he has been a transparent, 
proactive, and enthusiastic partner for Mem-
bers of Congress, our staff, and our constitu-
ents. He has responded to our inquiries and 
ideas with the resolute assurance that tech-
nology will not be a problem for our Library. 
The impact of these changes cannot be 
overstated. As the world’s largest library and 
home of both the Congressional Research 
Service and the U.S. Copyright Office, the Li-
brary of Congress stands as a beacon of 
knowledge and creativity the world over. Mr. 
Barton leaves the Library a stronger, more 
digitally enabled institution that is better pre-
pared than ever to serve the needs of Con-
gress, researchers, and all Americans. 
Please join me in wishing Mr. Barton a well- 
deserved retirement after a lifetime of faithful 
public service.

RABBI ISRAEL ZOBERMAN— 
JEWISH HIGH HOLY DAYS 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD the views submitted at the re-
quest of a Virginia Beach constituent, Rabbi 
Dr. Israel Zoberman, of Temple Lev Tikvah: 
The Jewish High Holy Days, also known as 
the Days of Awe, are a ten-day period com-
mencing with the New Year of Rosh Hashana 
and concluding with the Day of Atonement 
of Yorn Kippur. With humble Biblical roots 
and profound Rabbinic transformation, it is 
a sacred vehicle and opportunity set aside 
for inspiring soul-searching and heroic re-
solve to mend the brokenness of the human 
heart and do our called upon share, individ-
ually and collectively, to repair and heal our 
inner world as well as the outer one. Quite a 
tall order but a compelling one! 
The celebration this season takes place 
against the onerous backdrop of a threat-
ening gathering cloud of anti-Semitism—the 
world’s oldest and most resistant virus—at 
home and abroad as critical American de-
mocracy, alarmingly violated on 1/6, along 
with the unresolved burden of shameful 
Black slavery, lingering racism toward mi-
norities, urban unrest and a ravaging global 
pandemic with the State of Israel begrudged 
its rightful responsibility to protect its citi-
zens from those intent on obliterating the 
only sovereign Jewish country while denying 
the monumental Holocaust. What a perfect 
storm scenario for the resurrection of his-
tory’s worst images of hatred for the Other. 
The High Holy Days, peak Jewish religious 
experience, offer a reflective mirror into an 
ancient people’s awesome spiritual odyssey 
enabling it to somehow survive history’s 
high waves of relentless tsunamis through 
offering humanity noble teachings and indis-
pensable lessons. On Rosh Hashanah 5782 
(Based on calculating the generations enu-
merated in the Biblical Genesis) as we cele-
brate the world’s creation, our prayerful 
focus is not only on the wonder of the 
unfathomable acts of creation, but no less on 
the confounding complexity of human rela-
tionships. Our Biblical heroes, unlike the 
Greek ones, are flesh and blood creatures 
who both succeed and succumb, contending 
with blessings as well as blemishes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E966 
September 10, 2021 
The first Jewish family of Abraham, 
Sarah, Hagar, Isaac, and Ishmael, birthing 
the kindred monotheistic religions of Juda-
ism, Christianity, and Islam, reflects deep 
convictions along with searing conflicts 
whose profound impact is still with us today. 
This we know for sure, our basic human 
make-up of passions and prejudices, loves 
and hatreds has not changed. We remain sub-
ject to their influences in determining our 
conduct, positively and negatively. While 
naturally we tend to dwell on the multiple 
challenges and struggles of contemporary 
life, there is much we can absorb from those 
who laid the foundation for the twin compo-
nents 
of 
Jewish 
identity, 
faith, 
and 
peoplehood. 
Abraham and Sarah had the stamina to 
leave their home in pagan Mesopotamia in 
search of new beginnings—spiritually, phys-
ically, and psychologically. They were not 
deterred by the cumbersome obstacles such a 
journey and journeys would entail, sustained 
by a driving vision of an encounter with a 
God whose unifying message captured their 
yearning imagination. Soon they would dis-
cover, however, that their newly found 
breakthrough faith was intertwined with a 
fragmented reality. The shared tenets and 
tents in an unknown territory would become 
the testing ground for lofty ideals and bind-
ing values. The Rabbis teach us that the 
founders’ tent in the wilderness of Canaan 
was open on all sides to allow one and all to 
enter and be warmly welcomed, finding car-
ing respite and appreciated protection from 
both hostile humans and adverse elements. 
Are we equipped with the capacity to learn 
from mistakes and chart a new course of 
conduct and consideration, finally creating 
Shalom’s overarching harmony? The tradi-
tion ushered in by our progenitors is an opti-
mistic one, having faith in God as well as us, 
while sanctifying the precious gift of life. As 
we enter the portals of a new year may we

HONORING LOUIS TESSIER’S DEC-
ADES OF SERVICE AT THE DEDI-
CATION OF ‘‘LOU TESSIER WAY’’ 
AT THE WARREN COUNTY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Louis Tessier for his decades 
of service to Lake George and all of Warren 
County, New York, and to mark the dedication 
of ’’Lou Tessier Way’’ at the Warren County 
Airport. 
Louis Tessier first came to Lake George in 
the 1970s when he purchased the Four Sea-
sons Hotel. He quickly got involved in the local 
community and was elected to the Lake 
George Town Board in 1982. Just two years 
later, Mr. Tessier was elected as Supervisor of 
the Board, a position he held until his retire-
ment in 2009. His long list of accomplishments 
in this role includes overseeing $500,000 in 
renovations for the Lake George Town Hall, 
acquiring the land for Usher Park Beach, and 
assisting in building the Scoville Learning Cen-
ter at Adirondack Community College. In addi-
tion to his years of service on the Lake 
George Town Board, he also served as Chair-
man of the Board for Warren County’s Board 
of Supervisors, budget officer for Warren 
County, and a member of the American Le-
gion. 
A pilot himself, Louis Tessier was a devoted 
advocate for the Warren County Airport, He 
went out of his way to support the staff and 
assist them whenever they needed help. He 
put in hours of work to help organize the Adi-
rondack Balloon Festival. In honor of his com-
mitment to the airport and the community it 
serves, the Warren County Board of Super-
visors unanimously decided to rename the en-
trance road to the airport ‘‘Lou Tessier Way.’’ 
Mr. Tessier truly embodies the community 
spirit present throughout the North Country. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I would like to thank Mr. Tessier for 
his decades of service to Lake George and 
Warren County and congratulate him for this 
well-deserved recognition.

IN RECOGNITION OF MRS. VIVIANA 
MEDELLIN 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
deep sense of gratitude that I rise today to 
memorialize the significant contributions of 
Mrs. Viviana Medellin, an individual who went 
above and beyond to serve our KC Latino 
community. She poured her heart and soul 
into the empowerment of Latino voices, 
leveraging her Chicana roots and producing 
so many far-reaching programs that will carry 
her legacy forward while sharing her culture 
with many within the Greater Kansas City re-
gion. 
Before her public service, Mrs. Medellin fol-
lowed her dream of working with renowned 
cardiologists Dr. G. Hartzler and Dr. Barry 
Rutherford in the Cardiovascular lab at St. 
Luke’s Hospital. Prior to working in the Cardio-
vascular lab, she started at St. Luke’s as a 
nursing assistant and eventually retired after 
nearly 48 years of service and dedication to 
public health. It was during that 48 years that 
she met her amazing and loving husband, 
Richard Medellin, and together raised their 
children: Monica Holman, Robert A. Frias, So-
phia Byers, and Ricardo Medellin. 
Viviana not only was committed to public 
health in Kansas City, but she was also a de-
vout Catholic, as a long-time parishioner of St. 
Agnes Catholic Church. Having graduated 
from Redemptorist Catholic High School in 
1965, Viviana was charged at an early age to 
give back. She also served the Altar and Ro-
sary Society and as a member of the Our 
Lady of Guadalupe Circle. 
It is because of her pursuits to advance the 
celebration of her Mexican American culture 
that Viviana served as the President of Azteca 
de Greater KC and as Vice-President of The 
Greater Kansas City Hispanic Heritage, ad-
vancing several amazing programs over the 
years. Of those programs, Viviana was a sig-
nificant contributor to the Fiesta Hispanic cele-
bration that started in 1984 and has been a 
beacon of Hispanic celebration and acknowl-
edgement for decades. In addition, Viviana 
has been a host on Kansas City Community 
Radio station, KKFI 90.1 FM’s Taste of 
Tejano, where she combined her love of 
Tejano music and that of sharing her culture 
through the airwaves. She was certainly an 
amazing person, sharing her passion for her 
community with all of Kansas City, and for that 
she deserves great recognition. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in recognizing Mrs. Viviana Medellin 
for the tremendous accomplishments through-
out her career and her tireless efforts in pro-
viding Kansas City with celebration of the rich 
Mexican American culture, thriving within our 
amazing City. Her contributions to our commu-
nity have made a significant impact on Mis-
souri’s Fifth District and I speak on the behalf 
of the entire district when I say thank you to 
Viviana.

HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
MRS. 
SUSAN 
‘‘CHERI’’ 
CHERYL 
MAINARD OFNER 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Mrs. Susan ‘‘Cheri’’ 
Cheryl Mainard Ofner, beloved wife, mother, 
grandmother, patriot, and friend. 
Cheri was born July 27, 1951, in Dallas, 
Texas to the late Loretta and Aston ‘‘Dee’’ 
Dale Mainard. She was the oldest of four chil-
dren, and at an early age, developed a love 
for sports, her country, and the Lord. 
Cheri was a woman of great faith and spent 
her life dedicated to learning and sharing the 
Word of God. As a young girl, Cheri’s family 
moved to Houston, and attended Springs 
Branch Baptist Church, where her mother 
taught Sunday school. 
Cheri attended school as a National Merit 
Scholar at the University of Texas, where she 
secured a highly competitive spot on the gym-
nastics team. It was during gymnastics prac-
tice where Cheri met the love of her life, Lee 
Ofner, in January 1971. The couple’s first date 
was watching Superbowl V, played between 
the Baltimore Colts and the Dallas Cowboys. 
In 1972, Cheri graduated with a Bachelor of 
Business Administration degree in Finance & 
Accounting, and in 1973 married Lee in a 
ceremony at her home church in Houston, 
Texas. A few years later, in 1975, Lee earned 
a Doctorate in Dental Surgery degree from 
Baylor College of Dentistry and began his U.S. 
Navy tour in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. 
The couple moved back to Dallas after Lee 
completed his tour with the U.S. Navy. To-
gether with Cheri’s degree in business and 
Lee’s doctorate in dental surgery, they estab-
lished a successful dental practice in 1977. 
During this time, Cheri and Lee had two chil-
dren, Jay and Courtney. Cheri was an all-star 
mom, attending every soccer practice, school 
musical, ballet, Bible study, etc. She even 
coached Courtney’s gymnastics team. 
The Ofners eventually retired from dentistry, 
and ultimately, found their forever home in 
1991 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Cheri 
and Lee immediately became involved with 
their new community, joining several Bible

studies, volunteering on campaigns for the Re-
publican party, and helping with various 
events and fundraisers at the Colorado 
Springs Christian School. 
Since putting down roots in the Pikes Peak 
region, the Ofner family attended several 
churches in Colorado Springs, including Fel-
lowship Bible Church, Woodmen Valley Chap-
el, 
Rocky 
Mountain 
Calvary, 
Mountain 
Springs, and most recently, The Road@ 
Chapel Hills Church. 
For the last few years of Cheri’s life, she 
and Lee cared for her father Dee, a WWII vet-
eran, in their home, for which Cheri was ex-
tremely grateful. 
Cheri is survived by her husband of nearly 
fifty years, Lee; her loving children, CDR 
(USNR) Jay (Jennifer) Ofner of Mililani, Ha-
waii; and MAJ (USAF, Retired) Courtney (Kirk) 
Olsen of Colorado Springs, Colorado; her be-
loved grandchildren Amanda, Evie, Aaron, and 
Kylie; and her wonderful siblings, nieces, 
nephews, cousins, and friends. 
Romans 12:11 commands that His believ-
ers, ‘‘Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your 
spiritual fervor, serving the LORD.’’ Cheri did 
just this and lived her life with conviction, pas-
sion, and unadulterated love and excitement 
for her Heavenly Father. She leaves behind 
her husband, family, and friends who loved 
and adored her and who are celebrating her 
life and reunion in heaven with the Lord God, 
Almighty. I ask that my colleagues in Con-
gress join me in honoring my friend and fellow 
patriot, Cheri Ofner, in saying, ‘‘well done, 
good and faithful servant.’’

HONORING JEROME L. DAVIS FOR 
HIS SERVICE TO THE METRO-
POLITAN 
WASHINGTON 
AIR-
PORTS 
AUTHORITY 
AND 
CON-
GRATULATING HIM ON HIS RE-
TIREMENT 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate a leader in our business and 
transportation community, Metropolitan Wash-
ington Airports Authority Executive Vice Presi-
dent and Chief Revenue Officer Jerome L. 
Davis, on his upcoming retirement. As the Air-
ports Authority’s highest-ranking executive 
under the president and CEO, Davis has over-
seen the Office of Revenue, which includes 
Marketing and Consumer Strategy, Conces-
sions, Airline Business Development, Real Es-
tate, Commercial Parking, Communications 
and Government Affairs. Davis’ retirement 
caps off a career that has spanned more than 
four decades as a key executive in major U.S. 
corporations. 
Under Davis’ leadership, overall passenger 
traffic at Reagan National and Dulles Inter-
national airports increased by more than nine 
percent, led by growth at Dulles International 
through the addition of 30 new international 
routes and 15 new airlines. Davis’ efforts to in-
crease non-airline revenue boosted it to an 
unprecedented 57 percent of total revenue, a 
$90 million increase since 2015. In addition, 
he led a 2015 rebranding of the corporation, 
including the creation of a new logo to more 
closely tie the organization to the air travel in-
dustry and the National Capital Region. 
Davis also led an expansion and upgrade of 
the airports’ concessions program, recruiting 
many popular global and local brands to pro-
vide a greater ‘‘sense of place’’ for the Na-
tional Capital Region. His accomplishments in 
this area included the complete redevelopment 
of over 180 concessions locations, including 
shops and restaurants in Reagan National’s 
newly constructed concourse; launching new 
valet parking services; and executing agree-
ments for new passenger lounges, including 
the American Express Centurion Lounge com-
ing to Reagan National in 2022. 
Prior to joining the Airports Authority, Davis 
held key executive positions in corporations in-
cluding Procter & Gamble, Maytag, Waste 
Management, Electronic Data Systems and 
Frito-Lay. He also recently retired from the 
boards of two public companies, Apogee En-
terprises and GameStop Corp. Davis also has 
represented the Airports Authority on the 
board of directors of Destination DC, the Dis-
trict of Columbia’s official convention and visi-
tors’ bureau. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Mr. 
Davis and his service to our regional econ-
omy, the traveling public, and the gateways for 
our nation’s capital, and I wish him all the best 
in retirement.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
PATHFINDER DAY 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of National Pathfinder Day, a 
day in which to honor all those who have 
served in this elite group of soldiers. The 
Pathfinders hold a special place in the history 
and, more importantly, the successes of our 
Armed Forces. These brave volunteer soldiers 
were trailblazers who played a vital role in 
heightening our military’s precision and capa-
bilities. 
The Army Pathfinders were first utilized at 
the height of our involvement in World War II 
as newly formed paratrooper units were being 
scattered during combat jumps as far as 60 
miles from the target. Prior to their formation, 
a consistent tactical issue had been the inac-
curate and widely scattered drop zones for our 
paratroopers. The correcting course our mili-
tary found was to assemble volunteer units to 
drop in the prior night, undetected by the 
enemy, and set up marked drop zones for our 
parachuting soldiers and gliders—widely con-
sidered a suicide mission. However, these first 
Pathfinders’ bravery and tenacity in the face of 
a seemingly impossible mission led to suc-
cess. 
Pathfinders have been employed in every 
major conflict, continuing to drop into unknown 
enemy territory with no larger force to rely on 
for retreat or reinforcement. They would con-
tinue to do all of this in the name of providing 
their brothers-in-arms with accurate informa-
tion and other operational support. While mod-
ern technological advancements and the 
everchanging landscape by which we conduct 
warfare have shifted so that units such as the 
Pathfinders are no longer utilized, we would 
do well to remember the traits that these patri-
ots exhibited—bravery, selflessness, and an 
undying need to complete what was requested 
of them. Now as the National Pathfinder Asso-
ciation gathers in fellowship to commemorate 
this September 13th Day of recognition, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in reflecting upon 
these giants of valor.

HONORING MR. BRYAN O’BRIEN 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Mr. Bryan 
O’Brien, a recently-departed constituent of 
mine who served in the United States Air 
Force during the Vietnam War. Due to conten-
tious public debate on our nation’s involve-
ment in the war, returning Veterans were de-
nied the appropriate recognition for their serv-
ice. Thankfully, Mr. O’Brien and his fellow 
service members did not accept this unfair 
mistreatment. They advocated for one another 
and for future generations to ensure all return-
ing service members are treated with respect 
and honor, regardless of the public opinion of 
the war itself. They have been quite success-
ful in this endeavor. Bryan was a proud Mem-
ber of the SPC Zachary L. Shannon Memorial 
VFW Post 2550 in Dunedin, Florida. He also 
served as the national sergeant at arms for 
the VFW. He was a founding member and 
past vice-president of the Heritage Springs 
Veterans Club. A true patriot, Bryan loved his 
country and made an indelible mark on both 
our community and those who had the privi-
lege of knowing him. Indeed, Bryan leaves be-
hind a legacy of service and sacrifice. May his 
memory be eternal! My thoughts and prayers 
are with his widow, Patricia, and his three chil-
dren: McKenzie O’Brien, Craig Wagner, and 
Robert Wagner. Thank you, I yield back my 
time.

FOR WINNING THE LONG JUMP

Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Julia Finazzo of Galena, Illinois, 
for winning the Long Jump at the IHSA State 
Championships. 
Julia Finazzo competed in the IHSA State 
Competition at Eastern Illinois University in the 
100, 200, long jump and 4x100 meter relay. 
Finazzo finished first place in the long jump 
event, jumping 18 feet, which broke her own 
record. She also anchored the winning 4x100 
meter relay, which set a program record with 
a winning time of 50.46. As a former student 
athlete, I admire and appreciate Julia’s hard 
work and dedication to track. I am proud that 
she has represented the Galena community 
exceptionally well throughout the state. 
It is because of student leaders such as 
Julia that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would once again like to congratu-
late Julia Finazzo on her success in Track 
while competing at the state level.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
JEFFERSON 
AVENUE CHURCH OF CHRIST’S 
150TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JOHN W. ROSE 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the 150th Anniversary of the Jefferson 
Avenue Church of Christ located in my home-
town of Cookeville, Tennessee. What began 
as a small number of Christians meeting in 
1871 is now a strong institution providing gen-
erations with a place to practice their faith and 
be a part of a supportive community. 
In their early years, the church shared a 
building with a Methodist church on what 
today is known as Lowe Avenue. In 1874, the 
congregation moved to a new building north of 
the county square on the comer of Wash-
ington and Freeze Street. In 1908, to accom-
modate their growing congregation, the church 
built a new place of worship on Broad Street 
and took the name Broad Street Church of 
Christ. 
In 1909, seeing the need and benefit of 
higher education, Jere Whitson and other 
members of the Broad Street congregation led 
the founding of the University of Dixie, com-
monly called Dixie College and now known as 
Tennessee 
Technological 
University. 
The 
school currently has an enrollment of over 
10,000 students and offers a wide variety of 
degrees at different levels from eight aca-
demic schools and colleges. I am proud to be 
an alumnus from this university and take pride 
in their founding and traditions. 
As the area grew, the Broad Street Church 
of Christ congregation moved to plant other 
congregations in the area. They acquired land, 
supported construction of new church build-
ings, and identified members of Broad Street 
who were willing to be the initial members of 
the new congregations. These church plants 
are still active today. As the Broad Street 
building aged, the members decided in 1962 it 
was time to move south to the current location 
at 521 South Jefferson. 
Today, the Jefferson Avenue Church of 
Christ, led by the ministry team of Andy Brew-
ster as the pulpit minister, Evan Burns as as-
sociate minister, Jesse Bates as youth min-
ister, and Bo Perez as the Spanish-language 
minister, continues its commitment to mission 
work worldwide. Currently, it supports 30 min-
isters, 40 congregations, and a bible school in 
Nicaragua by providing humanitarian aid and 
training. They support nine preachers and a 
preaching school in Panama and the San Blas 
Islands. Jefferson Avenue also is committed to 
Healing Hands International and their work in 
developing countries, providing access to 
clean water and medical supplies. They con-
tinue to spread the word of God throughout 
the world through support of World Christian 
Broadcasting as well as Gospel Chariot Min-
istries who offer mobile evangelistic teams. 
The Jefferson Avenue Church of Christ is 
also making a difference here at home. When 
Gatlinburg Church of Christ lost its building to 
the 2016 wildfires, Jefferson Avenue was 
moved to assist in the rebuilding of their con-
gregation. In March of 2020, when tornados in 
Cookeville resulted in tragic loss of life, Jeffer-
son Avenue served as one of many distribu-
tion centers for emergency supplies. It also 
helped with direct assistance to many in need. 
Christian organizations like The Jefferson 
Avenue Church of Christ are the bedrock of 
our communities in Middle Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, I would like you to join me in hon-
oring and congratulating the Jefferson Avenue 
Church of Christ for 150 years of dedication 
and commitment to spreading the gospel right 
here at home and abroad.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
BUFFALO 
STATE 
COLLEGE 
SESQUINCENTENNIAL 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, today I rise to honor of my own alma 
mater, Buffalo State College, to recognize 150 
years of education and service to the Western 
New York Community. 
Buffalo State College, a member of the 
State University of New York (SUNY) system, 
opened in 1871 as the Buffalo Normal School 
to train teachers for the area’s growing public 
school system. Now the largest comprehen-
sive four-year college in the SUNY system, 
Buffalo State educates over 9,000 under-
graduate and graduate students each year. In 
addition to their renown Special Education 
program, the school offers 79 undergraduate 
majors, 11 post baccalaureate teacher certifi-
cation programs, and 64 graduate programs. 
Education is perhaps one of life’s greatest 
gifts and for the past 150 years, Buffalo State 
College has committed to providing access to 
quality public higher education, giving a count-
less number of students the opportunity for 
engaged and applied learning. As an alumnus 
myself, I have seen first-hand just how great 
of an institution Buffalo State really is. Its abil-
ity to improve and evolve each year with ever 
changing educational practices deserves the 
highest honor. 
Buffalo State is known for its strong commu-
nity connections and commitment to life-long 
learning. Graduates become scholars, leaders, 
and global citizens. The educational commu-
nity encompasses a diverse range of students 
and faculty. It is this commitment to diversity 
and inclusivity that has made Buffalo State 
into the institution it is today. This diversity 
creates a learning environment where all peo-
ple are welcome and helps to foster the 
growth of a knowledgeable, understanding 
community. 
It is attributes like this that have enabled 
Buffalo State to become a pristine institution 
within the Western New York Community for 
many years. I sincerely congratulate the fac-
ulty, staff, students, and alumni of Buffalo 
State College on being a part of the school’s 
storied history, and I look forward to seeing 
how Buffalo State continues to grow and de-
velop throughout the future. Go Bengals. 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF 9/11 
VICTIMS ON THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF SEPTEMBER 11TH, 2001 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in remembrance of the tragic events of Sep-
tember 11th, 2001, as we honor the loved 
ones lost 20 years ago. 
The horrific events that unfolded that day 
claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans 
and forever impacted many more. The sense-
less terrorist attacks that took place in New 
York City, Washington, D.C., and a field in 
Pennsylvania fundamentally altered our nation. 
Commercial airliners were weaponized, our 
Pentagon attacked, and the World Trade Cen-
ter Towers fell. Yet, in one of America’s dark-
est hours, Americans were united by God, 
heroism and compassion. 
As we take a moment to commemorate the 
great losses our nation suffered 20 years ago, 
we also continue to be inspired by the raw 
strength and resilience displayed by our great 
nation in the grief and aftermath. To this day, 
America’s fortitude continues to set an inter-
national example, even during trying times. 
While this day is still difficult and we cannot 
bring back those precious American lives that 
were tragically lost by the brutal attacks, we 
must never forget their sacrifice and those that 
protect our freedom. I commend the partici-
pants of Lake Havasu City’s 9/11 Rededica-
tion Ceremony for honoring the memory of the 
Americans lost on the twentieth anniversary of 
the September 11th, 2001 attacks. 
May God continue to comfort the families 
who lost loved ones and may God bless the 
United States of America.

Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Neel Hajra, the outgoing 
CEO of the Ann Arbor Area Community Foun-
dation based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His sig-
nificant contributions to our community are 
worthy of commendation. 
Mr. Hajra came to the Ann Arbor Area Com-

in 2015. He is a two-time graduate of the Uni-
versity of Michigan who started his career as 
an attorney with the Ford Motor Company. 
During a sabbatical from that job, he devel-
oped a love for community and the nonprofit 
sector. He later took a job at Nonprofit Enter-
prise at Work (NEW), where he remained for 
nine years before joining the Foundation. 
As CEO of the Community Foundation, his 
determination to create positive community 
change is infectious. Among his numerous 
successful endeavors includes establishing a 
scholarship program that increased graduation 
rates for underserved students, and launching 
a resilient support system for Washtenaw

County nonprofits so that the foundation can 
help them thrive. Years after his passion for 
the nonprofit sector was sparked, Mr. Hajra 
continues to show his dedication to community 
through his work. Even as a busy CEO, Mr. 
Hajra teaches courses in nonprofit policy and 
management to the next generation of leaders 
at the Gerald R. Ford School for Public Policy. 
The impact of his work in our community will 
be felt for years to come. 
Mr.

Washtenaw County and continues to serve his 
hometown as a vice chair for the Council of 
Michigan Foundations and as a member of the

recipient of two prestigious national awards: 
the Aspen Institute Fellowship for Emerging 
Nonprofit Leaders and the American Express 
NGen Fellowship. He resides in Ann Arbor 
with his wife Lisa and their three children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Neel Hajra for an exemplary 
decade of dedicated service to the Ann Arbor 
Area Community Foundation. He has effec-
tively served the Ann Arbor community and 
has 
enhanced 
the 
nonprofit

Washtenaw County and beyond. I join with 
Neel’s family, friends, and colleagues in ex-

THE TEARS—IN MEMORY OF 9/11 
HON. ANDREW R. GARBARINO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a poetic tribute in mem-
ory of the heroes and innocents lost on the 
20th anniversary of 9/11 at The World Trade 
Center penned by Albert Carey Caswell. 
TWENTY YEARS THROUGHOUT THE TEARS 
(by Albert Carey Caswell) 
Twenty years throughout the tears 
It was twenty years ago this day, 
what happened here upon our hearts which 
weighs 
All in our tears which flow each day 
All in what our prayers have come to say 
As we stop to ponder all the pain and woe it’s 
made 
The kind which only seems to grow only 
Heaven can allay 
When, we reunite with our loved ones one 
fine day 
As on this day that we stop to remember, 
what all happened here on the darkest of 
September’s 
When, we lost all of our loved ones as Towers 
fell down below 
Watching all of those scenes from hell we’d 
come to know 
As their most courageous hearts to new 
heights so rose 
What seems like just yesterday, 
still remains 20 years later all in our pain 
and woe 
As we teach our children well about all of 
those 
Those innocents and heroes of 9/11 who up to 
heaven rose 
The Men and Women up in the Towers 
The magnificent Fire Fighters and Police 
who chose to fight in the darkest of 
hours 
As it been twenty years of heartbreak and 
tears for all of us and our’s 
When, all of our loved ones went away 
On bended knee throughout the years oh how 
for them we’ve prayed, 
wishing but to with them one more day 
When, something or song reminds us of them 
as the tears come our way 
As we give thanks and praise to all of those 
heroes for what they gave 
Against such evil wrought on that day 
God bless those Heroes At Ground Zero hero-
ically fought and stayed 
Teaching us all about faith and glory, 
teaching us all about their courage and self-
lessness as was their story 
When, from out of all this pain and heart-
ache came such Gotham Glory 
As we watched Fire Fighters and Police, 
running up the towers towards sure death in 
disbelief 
To save precious lives all because of their 
selfless belief 
Mothers, Fathers, Sisters, Brothers, Parents 
and Grandparents and friends, 
we so loved in our hearts until the end 
Watching all those innocents and heroes 
dying right before our eyes crying 
And for all those children who had to grow 
up without moms or dads, 
and lost the best friends they’ll ever have 
Not to watch them grow up to be everything 
they hoped to be 
No one to read them stories at night to sleep 
No one to explain or nurture them of the 
meaning of life so very deep 
Or on Christmas or Hanukkah to share their 
love all in such joy so sweet 
Or High School graduations, 
or walk them down the aisle on wedding days 
in hearts to keep 
Witnessing with them the miracle of birth 
As a new generation comes into this world to 
ponder their true worth 
And then now all the ones who are dying 
from that second wave 
All because they chose to stay who dug in 
deep day after day 
To find all of those precious bodies which lie 
beneath to place in a grave 
To have a place to be with them and pray 
When, all across our Nation came a call to 
arms 
As all our fearless men and women of the 
Armed Forces ventured out into harm 
Who gave their precious arms and legs, 
and their lives in That Full Measure they so 
gave 
For heaven so holds a place, 
for all such selflessness souls of the human 
race. 
And Hush little baby don’t you cry, 
one day up in heaven you will look into your 
Mother or Fathers eyes 
Your parents have become Angels in The 
Army of Our Lord realize 
And when you lay your heads down to rest, 
they watch over you each night as you rest 
And when you wake you can feel their An-
gel’s breath 
So have a good life for them and this our 
world you will bless 
Sadly, time does not heal all 
only up in heaven when we hear our loved 
ones voices call 
As twenty years have flown on by, 
as we keep asking that question why? 
Knowing in our hearts it’s the battle of 
GOOD vrs EVIL therein lies 
As we watched the new towers up towards 
the heavens rise 
To build this great memorial of water falls 
and reflecting pools 
Etched upon it all their great names with 
hearts of love and courage full 
To build upon the exact footprint of the tow-
ers we fought for this sacred jewel 
So we would NEVER FORGET what hap-
pened, 
on that day when hearts over evil ruled, 
For a hallowed place to take all our children 
by the hand, 
to teach them well all about and make them 
understand 
All their precious souls so very bright 
Goodness . . . Evil. . . Darkness . . . Light 
Those brave hearts whose evil must fight 
Who bring the light 
As we remember that day when they taught 
us, 
The Darkness is no match for The Light 
And standing here this day, 
we can but not help to feel all of their pre-
cious souls telling us to pray 
For Mankind each day, 
and NEVER FORGET WHAT HAPPENED ON 
THAT DAY 
And to give thanks, 
and remember what the gift of hope to world 
and America gave 
And to try to live a life of courage, faith, 
hope, and love as they 
By the grace of God we will join them up in 
heaven one fine day 
As long as we carry them in our hearts 
they’re not gone 
As long as we remember them in our 
thoughts and prayers they live on 
Even twenty years later on this morn 
God Rest Their Souls, 
and may we try to live lives as caring and 
selfless as all of those

COMMEMORATING

MEDALIST 
RICHARD 
TORREZ, JR. 
HON. DEVIN NUNES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the accomplishments of Richard 
Torrez Jr., who earned a silver medal at the 
2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, 
Japan. 
Born on June 1, 1999, Mr. Torrez was 
raised in Tulare, California. He developed a 
love for boxing at a young age, following in 
the footsteps of his grandfather as well as his 
father Richard Torrez Sr., who competed in 
the 1984 Olympic Boxing Trials. As a child, 
Mr. Torrez was mesmerized by the Olympic 
games and dreamed of one day winning a 
medal for the United States. 
Mr. Torrez grew up in the boxing gym his 
father owns and operates, Tulare Athletic Box-
ing Club. Learning discipline and commitment, 
he quickly became an elite boxer. Family al-
ways remained at his core. His father, to this 
day, remains one of his coaches. 
Graduating from Mission Oak High School 
in 2017, Mr. Torrez was considered one of the 
most accomplished students of his graduating 
class. He was president of the school’s chess 
club and involved in the robotics team. He 
was also a varsity member of the football, 
basketball, and track teams. Mr. Torrez 
capped off his high school career as valedic-
torian of his graduating class. 
Fighting as a super heavyweight, Mr. Torrez 
placed fifth at the 2019 Elite World Champion-
ships, third at the 2019 Pan American Games, 
and first at the 2020 Boxam Tournament. He 
has successfully competed in many other tour-
naments as well, but reaching the Olympics 
have always been his biggest goal.

Mr. Torrez earned the right to represent the 
United States as a super heavyweight boxer 
at the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in 
Tokyo, Japan. His years of disciplined training 
were evident from his first fight, becoming the 
first American to vie for the super heavyweight 
gold medal since Riddick Bowe in 1988 at the 
Seoul Olympic Games. He made the United 
States proud by earning the silver medal. 
Through his accomplishments, Mr. Torrez 
brought great pride to his hometown. Hun-
dreds of people gathered in various places in 
Tulare to watch his fights. Signs supporting 
him were placed on most streets. He joins two 
other Tulare residents, Bob Mathias and Sim 
Iness, as the city’s Olympic medalists. 
All of America is proud of Richard Torrez Jr. 
His impact on U.S. boxing and his Central Val-
ley community will be long remembered.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF THOSE LOST 
AND 
THOSE 
WHO 
GAVE 
AND 
RISKED 
THEIR 
LIVES 
DURING 
THE 
TERRORIST 
ATTACKS 
LAUNCHED 
AGAINST 
THE 
UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 
11, 2001 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as 
tomorrow marks the 20th anniversary of the 
attack launched against the United States on 
September 11, 2001, I rise to remember the 
victims of that horrific tragedy and those first- 
responders who risked, and in too many 
cases, sacrificed their lives to rescue the oc-
cupants of the besieged World Trade Center 
Towers. The morning of September 11, 2001 
is, and will always be, a day like no other. It 
is a day all living Americans will remember be-
cause not since Pearl Harbor had there been 
such a dastardly and deadly attack on Amer-
ican soil. 
Twenty years later, my heart still grieves for 
those who perished on flights United Airlines 
93, American Airlines 77, American Airlines 
11, and United Airlines 175. When the sun 
rose on the morning of September 11, none of 
us knew that it would end in an inferno in the 
magnificent World Trade Center Towers in 
New York City and the Pentagon and in the 
grassy fields of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. I 
stand here remembering those who still suffer, 
whose hearts still ache over the loss of so 
many innocent and interrupted lives. 
My prayer is that for those who lost a father, 
a mother, a husband, a wife, a child, or a 
friend will in the days and years ahead take 
comfort in the certain knowledge that they 
have gone on to claim the greatest. prize, a 
place in the Lord’s loving arms. And down 
here on the ground, their memory will never 
die so long as any of the many of us who 
loved them lives. Madam Speaker, I watched 
as the first, and then the second, plane flew 
into the World Trade Center and was horrified 
when the buildings came down. 
I was in The Capitol and saw the billowing 
smoke from the wreckage at the Pentagon 
and was told about the missing third plane 
that met its fiery end in the empty fields of 
Shanksville, Pennsylvania thanks to the self-
less act of patriotic and heroic Americans. But 
as hard as it is to believe, out of a tragedy so 
overwhelming and horrific, something good 
and great emerged in the aftermath of Sep-
tember 11. On that day there were no Repub-
licans or Democrats. There were no North-
erners or Southerners or West or East Coast-
ers. We were not Red State or Blue State. We 
were all simply Americans. 
On that day, we were united in our shock 
and anger and sadness. We were united in 
our resolve to defend our country and protect 
the freedoms that has made America the 
greatest country in the history of the world. 
Later that day, I joined scores of my col-
leagues on the East Steps of the Capitol 
where we sang ‘‘God Bless America’’; lit can-
dles, held hands, and prayed for our country 
and its leaders. In the days ahead I travelled 
to New York City to visit first responders and 
victims still recovering bodies and rescuing 
victims of the attacks and became a charter 
member of the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity to ensure that 9–11 never again happens 
in America. A united America can never be 
defeated as Operation Enduring Freedom 
showed. 
The brave and valiant armed forces of the 
United States swiftly toppled the Taliban and 
liberated Afghanistan, making good on the 
pledge that ‘‘[w]hether the terrorists are 
brought to justice or justice is brought to the 
terrorists, justice will be done.’’ And though he 
ran and hid for almost ten years, Osama bin 
Ladin could not hide forever and evade the 
long arm of American justice, which, under the 
leadership of President Barack Obama, caught 
up with him on May 2, 2011. 
Madam Speaker, Americans take care of 
their own. Americans cherish freedom. Ameri-
cans cherish liberty. And Americans want 
peace. Not just for themselves alone, but all 
persons in every corner of the globe. Madam 
Speaker, ensuring that America is safe and 
secure and protected from another attack on 
American soil is the least we owe to the heroic 
passengers on Flight 93 and to the brave fire-
fighters of the FDNY and officers of the NYPD 
and the officers and civilians we lost in the 
Pentagon who gave faithful service to our na-
tion. 
Americans want their country to remain 
safe, free, and invulnerable to another cow-
ardly attack like the one we witnessed twenty 
years ago tomorrow. We owe that much to the 
Americans who lost and gave their lives. And 
we have an obligation to them to ensure that 
this nation—and its 241 year record of, and 
experiment in, democracy—shall long endure 
and can and will withstand any threat from for-
eign adversaries or home-grown domestic ter-
rorists. 
This nation, as with any nation, suffers the 
conceit that it is immune from attacks from 
within on its democratic pillars at its peril, as 
we learned tragically on January 6, 2021. On 
that now unforgettable winter day, a violent 
mob invited by the then-president of the 
United States came to Washington, D.C. and 
laid siege to the Capitol for the avowed pur-
pose of disrupting the constitutionally-man-
dated Joint Meeting of Congress to confirm 
the votes of presidential electors and an-
nounce publicly to the nation and the world 
the persons elected as President and Vice 
President of the United States. 
As a result of the mayhem instigated by the 
45th president, the congressional meeting was 
delayed for several hours, at least six persons 
lost their lives as a result of the insurrection, 
more than 138 officers, 73 from the United 
States Capitol Police Department and 65 from 
the Metropolitan Police Department in Wash-
ington, sustained injuries during the attack on 
the Capitol Building, several of which required 
hospitalization and dozens, if not hundreds, of 
officers will suffer in years to come with post- 
traumatic stress disorder and cope with 
coronavirus infections contracted from the un-
masked domestic terrorists and rioters who 
stormed the Capitol. 
All of this is more than enough to sound the 
warning bell that we are now engaged, as 
President Lincoln observed at Gettysburg, in a 
great contest testing the proposition that this 
nation, or any nation conceived in liberty and 
dedicated to the proposition that all are cre-
ated equal can long endure. This illustrates 
the reason why it is so vital that we enact leg-
islation to strengthen and fortify the foundation 
of our democracy, which is of course the right 
to vote and to have that vote counted. To do 
that, we must enact without delay H.R. 4, the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, 
and H.R. 1, the For The People Act. The right 
to vote is the sine qua non of democratic citi-
zenship; without it every other right is fleeting 
and temporary. 
That is why it is important to remember that 
the true and fundamental purpose of the Vot-
ing Rights Act was to give proof to the world 
that America was living the true meaning of its 
creed that all are created equal and doing so 
by protecting and empowering black Ameri-
cans, who had for two centuries been ex-
ploited, victimized, persecuted, scapegoated, 
cheated, and treated with both benign and 
malignant neglect all because they were ex-
cluded from participating in the political proc-
ess and the making of decisions that affected 
their lives. 
It is interesting to note the absence of the 
current frantic efforts to disenfranchise black 
voters and other persons of color had no ante-
cedent in 1994, when unexpectedly Repub-
licans won the House majority for the first time 
in 40 years and majorities in several state leg-
islatures across the country. Nor did it happen 
after the 2010 elections when Republicans re-
captured the House majority after holding the 
White House for two consecutive terms. 
Madam Speaker, what accounts for the lack of 
vote suppression action then and the des-
perate anti-democratic actions we see now is 
clear and simple. 
In 1994, 27 years ago, and as recent as 11 
years ago in 2010, conservative Republicans 
still believed they could compete for demo-
cratic political power fair and square and that 
their ideals, ideas, principles, and values could 
attract majority support. But with the demo-
graphic changes and generational replace-
ment taking place in America, the maturation 
and coming of age of the beneficiaries of the 
Great Society, and the rise of what social and 
political scientist call the ‘‘Obama Coalition,’’ 
they no longer believe that. So they now hold 
it as an article of faith that they cannot win if 
they do not cheat; instead of taking their ideas 
and arguments to the voters and letting the 
voters pick their leaders, they have opted to 
change the rules so they can handpick the 
voters. 
In The Flight 93 Election, the controversial, 
provocative, call to arms, conservative essay-
ist Michael Anton spelled out clearly the perils 
the antidemocracy forces feel surround them:

If you haven’t noticed, our side has been 
losing consistently since 1988. We can win 
midterms, but we do nothing with them. Call 
ours 
Hannibalic 
victories. 
After 
the 
Carthaginian’s famous slaughter of a Roman 
army at Cannae, he failed to march on an 
undefended Rome, prompting his cavalry 
commander to complain: ‘you know how to 
win a victory, but not how to use one.’ And, 
aside from 2004’s lackluster 50.7 percent, we 
can’t win the big ones at all. 
In his 1837 Lyceum Address titled ‘‘The Per-
petuation of Our Political Institutions,’’ Abra-
ham Lincoln warned that mobs or people who 
disrespected U.S. laws and courts would al-
ways pose the most dangerous threat to the 
perpetuation of United States: 
All the armies of Europe and Asia . . . 
could not by force take a drink from the 
Ohio River or make a track on the Blue 
Ridge in the trial of a thousand years. No, if 
destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be 
its author and finisher. 
But Lincoln advised us of the best defense 
against domestic threats and attacks on our 
democracy: public reverence for the Constitu-
tion and rule of law as ‘‘the political religion of 
our nation.’’ 
Madam Speaker, democracy in America is 
not an act, it is an activity; it is never finished 
or complete but always in the process of mak-
ing our union more perfect; and the nation will 
always be confronted with challenge of con-
firming the proposition that this nation, or any 
nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to 
the proposition that all are created equal can 
long endure. 
The price of liberty is indeed eternal vigi-
lance. But we can do this. We must do this. 
After all, we are Americans.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
RUSH 
CITY 
WOMEN’S CLUB 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. PETE STAUBER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Minnesota’s Rush City Wom-
en’s Club as they celebrate their 100th anni-
versary of community service. 
Since September of 1921, the Rush City 
Women’s Club has carried out their mission of 
Community Betterment and Mutual Benefit for 
the club and community members. 
From maintaining community parks to estab-
lishing a local library, the Rush City Women’s 
Club has demonstrated their commitment to 
live out their stated mission. 
Their impact on the Rush City community 
has been huge, and I am proud that the self-
less members of this club, past and present, 
take the initiative to make their communities a 
better place to live. 
The support the Rush City Women’s Club 
has provided to schools, nursing homes, li-
braries, and other local organizations is truly 
extraordinary and cannot go unnoticed. Those 
willing to serve their community, in any capac-
ity, are shining examples of what makes 
America an exceptional country. 
The women of the Rush City Women’s Club 
have taken great strides over the last 100 
years, and I wish them another 100 years of 
success and prosperity. 
RECOGNIZING SARAH RUDDER AS 
MY CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my great honor to recognize the incredibly 
resilient and athletically talented Marine Corps 
veteran, Sarah Rudder, as my August Con-
stituent of the Month. As a young girl, Sarah 
knew she wanted to be a Marine after watch-
ing an air show and the Silent Drill Platoon 
perform. She accomplished her goal, but in 
the wake of the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon 
in Washington, D.C. her dream of a long ca-
reer in the Marine Corps came to a close. 
While recovering bodies in the rubble of the 
famous building, Sarah sustained a career- 
ending ankle injury, forcing her to medically 
retire, and ultimately leading to amputation of 
her left leg below the knee. 
Following her career-ending injury, Sarah 
struggled to find the purpose and commitment 
that she felt while serving in the military. After 
being medically retired from the military, Sarah 
volunteered as an online coach for the Catch 
a Lift Fund, a nonprofit that provides fitness 
grants, equipment, and nutrition to combat- 
wounded veterans. It was within this program 
that Sarah launched her path to competitive 
fitness. After chronic pain, depression, and 
post-traumatic stress, her fitness journey 
morphed into a sense of therapy, helping to 
ease her stress and bring back the routine 
and drive she missed as a Marine. 
Sarah’s best course of action to relieve 
some of the strain and pain on her body from 
the original injury was to have her leg ampu-
tated below the knee. With her new sense of 
relief and a fitted prosthetic leg, she got seri-
ous about the fitness regimen CrossFit. In 
2015, Sarah tried out for the Warrior Games, 
an annual competition put on by the Depart-
ment of Defense for wounded active-duty 
service members and veterans. Sarah did so 
well that when she returned in 2016, she 
qualified to compete for Team USA at that 
year’s Invictus Games, a global competition 
for wounded service members that was start-
ed in 2014 by Britain’s Prince Harry. During 
her two years competing for Team USA at 
Invictus, Rudder won a dozen gold medals in 
the 100– and 200–meter running events, 
along with the 1-minute sprint row, shotput, 
discus, swimming, seated volleyball, and 
power lifting. 
Overcoming a life-changing injury is an in-
credible challenge, and I am inspired by the 
strength and perseverance Sarah has em-
bodied in her recovery journey. I thank Sarah 
for her service to our country, for her dedica-
tion to helping other disabled veterans in simi-
lar circumstances, and her unwavering drive to 
be her very best. I’m proud to honor Sarah 
Rudder as my August Constituent of the 
Month.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. RICHARD 
MORADO 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
deep sense of gratitude that I rise today to 
honor the significant contributions of Mr. Rich-
ard Morado, an individual that went above and 
beyond to serve our Latino and greater Kan-
sas City community. Richard has not only 
served our greater Kansas City community but 
has served our country, honorably and proud-
ly, when he joined the Navy in 1972, on an 
aircraft carrier. It was in the Navy and through 
his parent’s dedication to the community that 
Richard found his own passion for community 
service. 
After the Navy, Richard returned home and 
utilized his G.I. Bill benefits and received an 
associates degree from Penn Valley College, 
and later would graduate from Rockhurst Col-
lege with a business degree. Richard has car-
ried on the tradition of service his parents 
taught him at a very young age. His father 
Mike Morado was very active during the civil 
rights movements in Kansas City, as a local 
leader in the Hispanic community to fight for 
equity and justice. This vein was seared into 
Richard where he picks up from his father’s 
service. 
Richard joined several community organiza-
tions, serving in various capacities in several 
groups including: IMAGE, LULAC, the Amer-
ican G.I. Forum, MANA, and the COHOL Civil 
Rights committee. In addition, Richard has 
been a longtime volunteer for the local envi-
ronmental nonprofit Bridging the Gap. His 
service has been so significant that the Great-
er KC Hispanic Chamber of Commerce be-
stowed the Carlos Cortez Humanitarian of the 
Year Award to him in 2006, for his contribu-
tions to Kansas City. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in recognizing Mr. Richard Morado 
for the tremendous accomplishments through-
out his career and his tireless efforts in pro-
viding Kansas City with celebration of the rich 
Mexican American culture, thriving within our 
amazing City. Richard’s contributions to our 
community have made a significant impact on 
the Missouri’s Fifth District and I speak on the 
behalf of the entire district when I say thank 
you to Richard.

TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE 9-11 TERRORIST ATTACKS 
HON. ANTHONY GONZALEZ 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
20 years ago, our nation experienced true evil. 
On a crisp Tuesday morning, mothers, fa-
thers, brothers, and sisters went to work think-
ing it was just like any other day, not knowing 
in a matter of minutes that all of our lives 
would be changed forever. 
On that fateful day, we faced grave uncer-
tainty and an insurmountable threat to our way 
of life unseen in decades. 
But while that day brought us immeasurable 
pain and suffering, it also brought us together 
as a nation. 
It showed us that even in our darkest hour, 
the United States will never back down and 
proved again that Americans will always rise 
to the occasion. 
As we come together to remember 20 years 
that have passed since this tragedy, I would 
like to reiterate to all those who served: 
Your sacrifices and service have not and 
will not be forgotten. Just as we will never for-
get September 11, 2001, we will never forget

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
OLYMPIC 
TAVERN IN ROCKFORD ON ITS 
75TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 10, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Olympic Tavern for its 75th 
anniversary of serving the Rockford area. 
Anthony Rotella founded The Olympic Tav-
ern in 1945 when he returned from serving 
overseas in the U.S. Armed Forces. As a cook 
in the U.S. Marines, he figured he could use 
his knowledge and experience to open a res-
taurant, which has become a staple in the 
Rockford community for the last 75 years. Zak 
Rotello, Anthony’s grandson, currently runs 
the restaurant and has maintained 95 percent 
of his pre-pandemic staff during the last year. 
Zak credits his father, Tom, his grandfather, 
Anthony, and their staff, for keeping the doors 
open for all these years, always providing 
great service and great food. I commend the 
Olympic Tavern and its team of management 
and staff, who commit every day to serve the 
public. 
It is because of strong community business 
leaders such as Zak Rotello of the Olympic 
Tavern that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate the Olympic Tavern on its 75th Anni-
versary.
